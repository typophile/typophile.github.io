  from just before the turn of the century until 1945. There seems to be a wealth
  of information on this topic. I have especially been happy with the fairly recent
  research on blackletter, a form that seems near and dear to many typophiles.   \r\nI
  am wondering now about type and graphic design after the wall went up, in East Germany
  in particular. I know you are very knowledgeable on type history; please forgive
  my ignorance in regards to this period in history. I am seeking sources of information,
  or interesting asides, that may be hard for me to uncover at first. Just to get
  started...\r\nI am particularly interested in how individual designers fared after
  the wall cut them off from the greater design community. "

    1940 -1990 +- ); and look for stuff by the type designer Karl-Heinz Lange \u2014
    mainly the book Typoart Freunde.\r\n\r\n"

    you can find an interesting article about VEB Typoart and especially Karl-Heinz
    Lange. He was one of just a few type designer in the former GDR. '

    can get hold of it, the book \"typoart typenkunst\" is a good resource. Plus Horst
    Bunke's book on Albert Kapr. Also, Kapr's \"Kalligraphische Expressionen\" and
    \"Fotosatzschriften\" and \"Stationen der Buchkunst\"."

    should have attended the \u2018<a href=\"http://www.fontwerk.com/530/berliner-typostammtisch-1007-zusammenfassung/\">Typostammtisch</a>\u2019
    meeting in Berlin last autumn! ;-)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.primetype.com/home_profile.php?p=8\">Karl-Heinz
    Lange</a> held an intriguing lecture about his 60 years as a type designer. \r\n\r\nOne
    of his stories was of how once Typoart had commissioned him to draw a typeface,
    similar to [[Hermann Zapf]]\u2019s successful [[Optima]]. Lange suffered from
    pangs of conscience: he didn\u2019t want to be regarded as a plagiarist, of course.\r\nHis
    hope was that his personal handwriting style would rub off on the design and make
    the letterforms look sufficiently unique. But he wasn\u2019t really sure about
    that.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a family celebration, Lange got an exit permit
    to leave the GDR. He seized the opportunity and met with Zapf in Frankfurt/Main
    (West Germany), in order to show him his sketches for \u2018<a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Publica\">Publica</a>\u2019.
    \u201CAfter what felt like an eternity \u2013 it must have been 5 minutes\u201D,
    Zapf gave his consent and shook hands with his East German colleague.\r\n \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/1477637812/in/set-72157602243856192/"

  body: "Florian... thank you for posting the Publica and Korger link. Hildegard is
    one of my favorite calligraphers and people know little or nothing about her.
    Kapr gave a bit of space in his Scripts book. Publica is a beautiful face and
    does in fact distance itself from Optima and resolves some issues that Optima
    had.\r\n\r\nMichael"
