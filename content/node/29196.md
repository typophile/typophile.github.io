    If this thread bothers you, just ignore it.  You are not required to read it.
    \ Think of it like scanning a newspaper for articles you want to raed or channel
    surfing on your TV. Just zip by the stuff you are not interested in.  Obviously,
    you should just zip by this.  It would be a lot easier and much less painful than
    opening it twice, scrolling to the bottom, then clicking next page and scrolling
    to the bottom again. I assume when you go to a resturaunt, you don't order things
    from the menu that you don't like, eat them, order seconds, eat more, and then
    complain?\r\nI'm really sorry that you find me annoying. I wish you a happy and
    contented life and once in a while, a good laugh.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    commercial but that was not my intension. I have never used any of them commercially.
    \ I just put them together for fun. Most of the old movie images are readily available.
    \ I have seen some of the same images used commercially by others so if I would
    ever want to do a real ad or something, I would pursue either purchase of rights
    or else make my own art.  Most of the fonts I am using in these now have never
    even been released. The images of me would be okay since I know the guy ;-)\r\n\r\nAs
    I recall, I made all of these in a day or two, most of them in response to comments
    on the original thread in 2006. I just put something together in 10 minutes and
    posted it.  If I were seriously going to do this, I would take much more time
    and look at audience/message couplets before even thinking about image rights.
    \ Most likely, I would shoot my own photos, buy stock images (as I have done on
    my MyFonts flags), or just draw the image.  The average type buyer today is probably
    too young to relate to 60 year old images anyway."
