  books in a bolder font. (He wants to please a small percentage of readers who complained
  that the font was too light or hard to read.) The editors don't want a font that
  will increase page count. It's like a war-zone in the office!\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe
  books are 8.5 x 11, type is set at 9 pts. on 11 pts. leading, Palatino Roman, two
  columns, 22p0 wide. Some paragraphs are long, but the majority of text is written
  in bite-sized chunks. I'm reluctant to change the typeface to Palatino Medium or
  any other typeface with a thicker weight since the paper is thin and text shows
  through slightly.\r\n\r\nWhat other typefaces have a large x-height, comparable
  (or better) to Palatino at 9 pts., not too light, not too dark?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: I would buy the complete <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/grades_duplexing.html">Mercury
    Text</a> family. The four grades will offer you four (slightly) different weights
    that allow you to increase or decrease the weight without changing copyfit. If
    possible, it would be best to test all four grades on press and choose the best
    grade for your readers. Mercury is also one of the most legible (and best looking)
    text faces available.

    what most people would call Bold) text fonts. Look at the work of\r\nFred Smeijers
    for some good morena faces.\r\n\r\nAnd if you need something that's also narrow,\r\nand
    classical, consider Octavian - of my top favs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "You are cramming too much into the page.\r\n9 on 11, two columns of 22 picas,
    that's no good.\r\n3 columns of type that size would be OK for a magazine or newsletter.\r\nIn
    general, two columns for a book is a bad idea, and you certainly need some margin
    space.\r\nThe book page requires a little breathing room.\r\nIt's the density
    of your layout which makes the type look small.\r\n\r\nYou will get a more spacious
    look with a lighter face -- try Aldus at 9.5 on 11, it is basically Palatino with
    longer extenders, and that setting has the same character count. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PalAld_4839.jpg]"
