  really only need the font used to spell out \"PRTM\" identified, please.]\r\n\r\nSo,
  I saw a font that I'd like to use on my own site, but when I attempted to contact
  the company regarding what font they used, they responded with an email telling
  me they had been bought out and simply had no record of the font used on what used
  to be their logo and had no way to contact the designer who made their logo.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can identify this font, you'd be my personal hero. I managed to find the
  old logo posted online here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whartonwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/prtm_logo.jpg"

  body: I got a similar result from WhatTheFont, but that isn't quite right because
    what I really liked were diagonal cuts on the "P" and the "R" where the loop closed.
    And, Gabriel Sans doesn't do that. Even the modified versions don't quite do it.
    I do appreciate the attempt. Have any other suggestions/ideas/guesses?

  body: Modifying type means to change some aspect of the type. Likely, these notches
    are the thing changed.
