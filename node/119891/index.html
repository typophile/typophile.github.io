  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi to all</p>
<p>I would like first to be excuse about my bad english. But, I know that genthemen you are will do this&hellip;</p>
<p>I wanted to write here about ADF fonts, in order to answer to so many mails I received and to close, clarify some bad songs I can read from some who think better me what ADF fonts are. I hope that your contacts shoud make the rest&hellip;</p>
<p>For the presentation, I&rsquo;m 48 year&rsquo;s old, maried with three children, my suns. I come from the print and desktop publishing, this explains, maybe, all my stuff. 
I started to work on fonts with fontographer to correct fonts for print job&hellip; Don&rsquo;t think that all commercial fonts are perfect, at least at this time. Maybe things are different now&hellip; That said, I still use Manutius2 to run the first drawings (yes I know, but it is difficult to change its ways), then FF to complete them with AFDKO and other tools&hellip; Initially, the free publication was far from what it is today. This is an area where I wanted to hire me as an artist, a painter of glyphs, keeping in mind that the goal was not to copy, but to learn from the essence of a character to develop my own vision and because I love make fonts.
Baskervald is certainly very close to Baskerville, that&rsquo;s true but many things make it different. Baskerville is Baskerville, Baskervald il Baskervald. Universalis is not a clone of Futura as I could read it. Universalis resembles to Futura just because it is inspired from it. But when you look closely it is far to be a clone. Gillius No. 2 and Gillius just pull their traits from the spirit of GillSans, only the spirit and ultimately an style exercice. I thank those who view it as a modernized version of Gillsans. I did not have this claim. Berenis is a simple drawing, a didonne, any of elegance dedicated to the one I love. This is not a bodoni, just something in the same spirit. Bodoni is bodoni, Berenis is Berenis. Why to compare ? As design they are just alternatives but, are themselves own characters.
When I forged mintspirit, it was for my personal use. I just shared with those who would like why not. But in no case be the font for mint distribution , as can be read, and in any case far from my words, and be peeled on her curves. In this sense, when a painter makes a painting, no one brings his knowledge to tell him to move the tree to the left, the green leaves would be better more clearer, and instead of the lake should be put a house. His painting is done with his sensitivity. No picture is ugly, you like it or not, same thing for fonts. If I chose to forge the &ldquo;e&rdquo; of Mekanus font like this is because I wanted so.</p>
<p>To conclude, a font is a design choice, guidance drawing made ​​with the sensibility of the artist I am as a brush on a painting, which gives life to the lines to get letters&hellip; Nothing more.</p>
<p>Before leaving the pen. The ADF site is not abandoned, I will do updates later. I&rsquo;m working for some time on other collections, commercial for this time. I take this opportunity to thank Té Rowan who has done so much publicity for ADF fonts and is very inspired by the work done.</p>
<p>thank you for reading
