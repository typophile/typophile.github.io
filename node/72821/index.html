  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I created several web-font stacks based on different styles: neo-grotesk (realist sans-serif); geometric; humanist body; humanist display; renaissance; neoclassic; baroque; romantic; and monospace. I am still puzzling with Georgia.</p>
<p>Georgia is a wonderful web-font for display and book, but I cannot classify it perfectly. Do you believe it is a realist serif, baroque typeface, or&hellip;?</p>
<p>Also, do you think Century Schoolbook is a good Georgia-alternative for web-body or/and display?
Is Century Schoolbook not somewhat different in style?</p>
<p>Thank you for you reactions.</p>
<p>Greetings,
Bart</p>

Additionally, at small sizes on low res displays, the characteristics of genres does not play as huge a role compared to the x-height, when the jump from one to two pixel stems occur and how wide the font sets.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for your reaction. Yes, Georgia is the best serif for screen and very popular too. I know it is designed for screen usage. The problem is that it is not that popular on Linux systems and I want to give a subtle alternative for if you want to pair it for example with Century Gothic or other geometric or realist fonts available on most computers. Century Schoolbook is also very readable on screen.</p>
<p>Transitional is too broad for me for creating font stacks that communicate a specific era.
The information I found until now point in the direction that Georgia is a realist serif font, but nobody writes it plainly.</p>

<p>@font-face is of course wonderful. I still have some issues with it. I noticed some companies have download restrictions and cannot see custom font-face fonts. It is strange I know, but still a problem. Furthermore I have some difficulties with availability and price of the fonts, or the lack of italics and bolds.</p>
<p>The font-stacks I created can be found at <a href="http://www.bzzen.com/2010/06/lettertypes-voor-het-web/">http://www.bzzen.com/2010/06/lettertypes-voor-het-web/</a> . Although the text is in dutch you will probably understand the most important information ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Transitional</strong> is a perfectly acceptable&ndash;and limited&ndash;Vox-ATypI type classification and, at least according to some sources, is synonymous with <strong>Realist</strong>, although the former, I believe, is preferred among type purists. The 3.3% of computer users who use Linux can probably limp along on some version of Century but, unless the specific font has been optimized for screen use, it just won&rsquo;t look as good as Georgia&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I always thought Transitional was not preferred by type purists. Robert Bringhurst writes:</p>
<p><cite>Several systems are in use for classifying typefaces. Some of them use fabricated terms such as &lsquo;geralde&rsquo; and &lsquo;didone&rsquo;. Others rely on familiar but vague labels such as &lsquo;old style&rsquo;, &lsquo;modern&rsquo; and &lsquo;transitional.&rsquo; All these systems work to a certain extend, but all leave much to be desired. They are neither good science nor good history.</cite></p>
<p>I agree with Robert. Over 100 years, what we now call &lsquo;modern&rsquo; could be &lsquo;old&rsquo; or &lsquo;transitional&rsquo;. These names are temporary.</p>
<p>Century is very readable on screen and sometimes style is an important factor. It also depends on other things like size, line height and line width.</p>

<p>Well, if your mind is already made up, why ask for anyone else&rsquo;s input?</p>
<p>The terms are neither arbitrary, nor temporary. <strong>Transitional</strong> makes perfect sense in that its typeforms reflect a <em>transition<em> from the angular stress of &ldquo;Oldstyle&rdquo; types to the vertical stress of &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; styles, whereas <strong>Realist</strong> doesn&rsquo;t explain anything, nor does it place the designs within their proper historical context.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>But letterforms are not only objects of science. They also belong to the realm of art, and they participate in its history. They have changed over time just as music, painting and architecture have changed, and the same historical terms &ndash; Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Romantic, and so on &ndash; are useful in each of these fields. This approach to the classification of letterforms has another important advantage. Typography never occurs in isolation. Good typography demands not only a knowledge of type itself, but an understanding of the relationship between letterforms and the other things that humans make and do. Typographic history is just that: the study of the relationships between type designs and the rest of human activity &ndash; politics, philosophy, the arts, and the history of ideas.</cite></p>

<p>I have described their relationship on page 5 of the <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf"> Modern Suite PDF specimen</a>.</p>
<p>The Scotch Roman is transitional, but between the Modern and Scotch Modern, not between the oldstyle and the modern, which is all about Baskerville.</p>

<p>Old Nick
Please allow me to bring a little French-speaking perspective in the debate about the word &ldquo;Realist&rdquo;. 
In his classification, Maximilien Vox gave the name &ldquo;RÉALES&rdquo; to the category of typefaces which seemed to aknownledge the influence of the &ldquo;Romain du Roi&rdquo; (end of the seventeenth century) — which corresponds broadly to the &ldquo;Transitional&rdquo; word used in English-speaking countries. The word &ldquo;Réales&rdquo; itself doesn&rsquo;t exist in French (it is another of Vox&rsquo;s infamous neologisms) but etymologically alludes to &ldquo;royalty&rdquo;, indeed. 
I&rsquo;m not sure you can equate it with &ldquo;Realist&rdquo; without causing some ambiguities : for example, as it was already mentioned, Bringhurst uses this very term for nineteenth-century typefaces (Clarendon, etc.) in reference to the Realist painters (Gustave Courbet et al.) of the same era.</p>

<p>I am aware that the word <em>réales</em> doesn&rsquo;t exist in French; however, the word <em>real</em> (with the e pronounced as an e acute in French) does exist in Spanish, and it is translated as &ldquo;royal.&rdquo; I agree that Vox-aTYPI&rsquo;s adoption of the term only seems to cause confusion, especially when the picture is muddled with historical reference to Realist painting, which is entirely beside the point.</p>
<p>I have been operating under the apparently mistaken assumption that the kind of Type Classification we were discussing was structural: while the first Transitionals may have been designed during a specific period of time, it is still possible today for someone to design a typeface that is essentially Transitional in structure. If one mucks up the classifications by adding point-in-time as definitive of style, then what are we to call a Transitional typeface designed today? Postmodern Semi-Scotchy? What do you call this monstrosity, which made its appearance within the Realist period?</p>

The fact is, I never really was a fan of Vox&rsquo;s classification, which mixes structural facts and intellectual pretensions (IMHO). I&rsquo;ve always been more at ease explaining the evolutions of type design to my students in relation to art history, which sometimes clarifies a few points : I can&rsquo;t, for example, put Fournier (in essence a rococo stylist) and Baskerville (an early neo-classicist) in the same &ldquo;Réales&rdquo; bag (without even mentioning the fact that the name itself overemphasizes the historical importance and the influence of the whole &ldquo;Romain du Roi&rdquo; affair).
I agree with you that historical categories are only points of departure (the very moment a particular style first appeared) and that it&rsquo;s still possible today to design typefaces which could eventually be labelled &ldquo;rococo&rdquo; (MVB Sirenne), &ldquo;neo-classical&rdquo; (FF Danubia), or whatever.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As much as Bringhurst has become part of the Typophile <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15349">Triumvirate</a> I have to say I really think the term Realist rubs me the wrong way.
