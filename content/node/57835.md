  that is similar to Christian Schwartz's DB News\r\nhttp://www.christianschwartz.com/dbnews.shtml\r\n\r\nChristian
  actually recommend me to check out Garamond no. 3 and I do agree that it is very
  similar but there is just something about the DB News typeface that makes it different
  with the serifs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRob"

    The hardness of the details reminds me a bit of DB News.

  body: "If you want something in that kind of plain oldstyle vein, but not quite
    as soft as Garamond No.3, then take a look at James Montalbano's [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/characters/?ID=56|Rawlinson]]
    -- an underappreciated family, IMO. I like its sturdy, plain-spoken qualities.
    It's not as sharply cut as Christian's DB News, but it shares some DNA.\r\n\r\n--
