body: I've just been handed a whole lot of collateral materials to work on, all set
  in Gothic720. I dislike the way that the uppercase letters appear heavier than the
  lowercase letters. Can anyone recommend another (similar) typeface that does not
  have this problem, yet has approximately the same weight and feel? I'd like to see
  if I can persuade the client to make the switch before going to print... Any help/advice
  would be greatly appreciated!
