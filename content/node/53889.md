  . However the link doesn't seem to work on my pc. If anyone could upload them for
  me I would be very grateful. \r\n\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\n\r\nostorey"

    post, and a little creative research on Google, but I don't have the conscience
    to share the link. Sorry.\r\n\r\nDo you have the rights to use them? Has Tesco
    given you permission to download them?\r\n\r\nThey are nice, but they are unmistakeably
    proprietary, and should the wrong eyes see them on non-Tesco work, you may regret
    having ever gotten them... \r\n\r\n<strong>From DaltonMaag, on the Tesco font</strong>:\r\n<em>Created

  body: "Hi, I understand. However, why are they available on the internet. I wish
    to use them on a project. I have emailed Tesco about the fonts, but i haven't
    yet recieved a reply. I really need they for a piece of work due in soon. I would
    be willing to pay a large sum of money for that link. Please again reconsider
    that, and decide weather you will give me the link.\r\n\r\nMany, Many Thanks\r\nostorey"

  body: "Cool. \r\n\r\nJudging by their brand guide, I'm guessing that designers who
    have been contracted to work for them are able to download their official resources.
    I don't believe it's a public link. Sometimes, someone talks and the link gets
    shared, and on and on... \r\n\r\nAll they'd need to do is secure it with PHP and
    share a login and password with their contractors.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck."

  body: "No, that would be illegal and disrespectful to Dalton Maag and Tesco.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's that important to you, you can probably find it the way I did. As I said
    earlier, I simply did some creative Googling using nothing more than the info
    you gave in your initial post.\r\n\r\nI am respectfully bowing out of this discussion."
