  working on an assignment and desperate to find a newspaper which uses Bondoni as
  it's primary font.\r\n\r\nAny other Bodoni examples, current or otherwise, would
  be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nGoogle isn't cutting it!\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: I'm not sure about newspapers, but if you look for the work of Massimo Vignelli
    and Pentagram (for starters) you'll find plenty of Bodoni in use.

  body: "You won't likely find Bodoni in the body copy of any newspaper. But it's
    still found as headletter in some papers.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post is still
    using a custom headline Bodoni that Matthew Carter designed for them, called Postoni.
    You can check it out at the Newseum.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=DC_WP&ref_pge=lst\r\n\r\nCan't
    think of any others off the top of my head, but I'm sure others will chime in.\r\n\r\n--
    Kent.\r\n"

  body: ITC Bodoni is still too wide for proper use in the news. It is just too sparkly
    and pretty.

  body: "Miss Tiffany's right, Bill. I think the \"sparkle\" is a function of the
    contrast in the thick/thin strokes in the letters, and none of the photocomp or
    PostScript Bodoni's have solved that for text-size settings.\r\n\r\nI'll allow
    that I find Bodoni for text as tough a nut as Sumner found Janson. I did rework
    a Bodoni Book I'm not terribly satisfied with -- Rich Hendle likes it, but he's
    sometimes too easily pleased. You could fix it after Janson . . .\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAs
    I remember, for a source for Bodoni used for body copy, you need look no further
    than older issues of <cite>Life</cite> magazine -- 1960s was it?"

  body: "My wife remembered that the books by/on Wallace Fowlie published by Duke
    University Press were set in Bodoni (Linotype metal, by Heritage printers).\r\n\r\nWhile
    hot metal was different, it was also just one way of putting ink on paper. The
    changing of paper, ink, and the method of putting ink on paper might mean we can't
    exactly mirror letterpress, but we could, if someone cared to put in the work,
    come quite close.\r\n\r\nI think Bodoni is a fine font for books. The Google scan
    doesn't show the type terribly well, but here is a link to <cite>Journal of Rehearsals</cite>:\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=t7Ug36454tUC&dq=journal+of+rehearsals&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=7Fbb7hYmfp&sig=Q22oppKyooyVpVHrE05xyO0hX0U&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result\r\n\r\nFWIW"
