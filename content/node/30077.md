  body: "<em>\u2026and the next version uses Helvetica?</em>\r\n\r\nI don't know what
    happened afterwards. I collected cigarette packages in the UK in the early 1970s,
    but then moved to Canada, quit that hobby (and the habit), and haven't paid attention
    to cigarette package design since.\r\nWhat got me interested in the first place
    was the addition of the warning, which spoiled the designs, and drew my attention
    to the nice old packages, which I had occasionally come across in second-hand
    markets. There was also a sub-culture of collectors.\r\nThe evolution of the Cadillac
    tail-fin would also make a good animation.\r\nAnd I suppose the same thing could
    be done for typefaces -- sort of an animated Multiple Master along the time axis."
