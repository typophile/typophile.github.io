body: "Hello there,\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that short-cuts to accents were
  keyboard dependant, but a french friend i'm helping out is having problems...\r\n\r\n<cite>At
  this time there is just 2 tiny problems : (it's hard to explain, it's a very specific
  french rule). I need this : \xE2 \xEA \xF4 \xEE \xFB - when I use first ^ and then
  the A (^+A) it works only for the cap the \"\xF4\" works only when I use alt+^ ,
  and I really prefer ^+o ? and If it's possible I need the same combination for \xE4
  \xEB \xEF \xF6 \xFC : MAJ+^+A, etc. can I have the \"\" when I use directly the
  \" and \" one the keyboard, not alt+\" and alt+\" ?</cite>\r\n\r\ndoes that make
  sense to anyone? all the glyphs exist and I can't for the life of me work out what's
  wrong... help!"

    on the Macintosh. Here is a grab of the keyboard viewer when the alt key is down:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/USextended_5645.jpg]\r\nThe
    keys in orange are \"dead keys\"; when you type them, you choose your accent,
    and after that you type the letter to put it on. To get \xF4, you thus type \"alt
    6\" (and there may be a \u02C6 or not displayed on top of the 6 on the physical
    keyboard) and then you type \"o\".\r\n\r\nTo change the behavior of the keyboard,
    you go in \"system preferences\" > \"International\" > \"Input menu\" and select
    the keyboard you want. \"French\" will select an azerty keyboard, \"Canadian French\"
    a variation of qwerty. Also select \"Show input menu in menu bar\" so that you
    can switch rapidly between keyboards if you use more than one, and also be able
    to select conveniently \"Show keyboard viewer\" (whose grab is above when the
    Alt key is pressed while using the US-extended keyboard).  If none of the predefined
    keyboards pleases you, you can build yourself your own using <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele\">Ukelele</a>,
    the Mac OS X Keyboard Layout Editor from SIL. \r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"
