		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I am looking for is a dictionary to check the spelling of as many words as possible<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo; is is very broad question. Do you mean the world&rsquo;s biggest? Most popular? Most languages? Sold most copies? Electronic? Reviewed? Up to date?</p>
<p>Can you provide a little more background information about yourself and this project? Is it personal, academic, or professional? Who is your audience? What are their goals? Information like this will help people provide you with more meaningful feedback.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia&rsquo;s page on &ldquo;Major English dictionaries&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has many options. Be mindful that certain people the same word different ways of spelling the same word (eg, Americans = color, Canadians = colour).</p>
<p>I am not a linguist so I cannot offer much advice, but I fairly confidant that the people who designed this system double checked their sources. From their page, they appear to be an American company so they probably use an American English dictionary.</p>
<p>I still fear something is getting lost in translation (pun intended). Are you coming from an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> perspective and looking at issues of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spelling reform<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Are you interested in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->orthography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they used?</p>
<p>You may want to research <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Simplified Spelling Society<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You have most likely read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article that Eye magazine published about the Initial Teaching Alphabet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To rephrase and clarify your question, do you mean:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->primary source<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used to determine the spelling of the words they selected when they originally developed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Initial Teaching Alphabet<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->?&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Apologies if I have been unclear. What I am looking for is a dictionary where I can look up how to spell, for example, the word &lsquo;rules&rsquo; using the ITA. Looking at the ITA chart that gives examples of how to pronounce each letter, I can see that there is a traditional &rsquo;s', &lsquo;z&rsquo; and a reversed &lsquo;z&rsquo;. Now, if I am unsure of which letter to use to replace the &rsquo;s' in the traditionally spelled word &lsquo;rules&rsquo;, it would be helpful to look this word up in a dictionary that shows how an American English word would be spelled using the letters and orthography of the ITA. Such a dictionary exists for the UNIFON alphabet and is extremely helpful.</p>
<p>As for my background, I am a Graphic Designer specializing in typography and book design, currently studying for an MA in Graphic Design. My original research question was &lsquo;Can I achieve greater correspondence between the spoken and written language by adapting an alphabet or creating a new writing system?&rsquo;, which led me to research alphabets such as the ITA and UNIFON. I am therefore, interested in both the orthography and the design of the letters.</p>

<p>IIRC, the ITA, because it was meant to teach children to read, rather than serve as a phonetic alphabet, was allowed to represent the same sound in more than one way, in order that in some cases there would not be too large a divergence between ITA spellings and conventional English spellings.</p>
<p>I could be mistaken, but if that is the case, that would reduce its applicability to your question. The answer to that question, though, of course is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; - look at the Shaw Alphabet, or the suggestions of the Simplified Spelling Society - I recall a book by Mont Follick, in which the use of a new alphabet was avoided. The trick was using ' to indicate where two consecutive vowels did not form a dipthong.</p>
