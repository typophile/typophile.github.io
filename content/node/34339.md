body: I know there's a lot of Japanese inspired fonts out there & a lot of receipt
  like fonts, but I thought it would be nice to combine them. I've made a monotype
  font (for the receipt look) with Japanese inspired characters... Kind of what I
  imagine a receipt in Tokyo might look like ;-)

    letters are quite easy to recognise though. At least if you know what they are
    supposed to be, since it is in alphabetical order.\r\nCan we see a demo receipt?\r\n"

  body: "In order to get a receipt, you need to buy something first ;-p\r\nBut since
    I don't really have anything to sell, I made a few pangrams for you to see the
    font in use.\r\nHope it's still legible...\r\nThe trickiest letter was probably
    the M since I was working on a grid of 4x5 and had to figure out a way to include
    the middle vertex (for the W, I just flipped the M for my own convenience). The
    I was also a bit of a challenge getting it wide enough, but I like the floating
    dot at the left (which -again- i redid for the J, except this time at the right
    side)... It gives it an extra Japanese feel & remains monospaced."

  body: "After the Japanese receipt font, I figured I should do a regular one as well.
    Now I've ended up with 4 receipt fonts (each of which has 3 variations; a full
    version, a dotted version & a pixel version). Since the numbers & symbols are
    quite universal, I've used the same ones for each font & for the same reason (and
    a little laziness on my behalf maybe) I've also reused certain characters for
    different fonts (how much can you really do with a 4 by 5 pixel limit anyway?).
    I still think I've managed to capture the characteristics of the foreign alphabets
    for each font, but as a test I'll leave it up to you to name them ;-)\r\nBTW,
    I \xE0m aware of the fact that the regular M looks a lot like an N, but once set
    in text, it actually seems to read as an M (trust me, I was as surprised as you
    are ;-p )"

    the new name speaks for itself ;-)

  body: "OK, I've added another alphabet, but I had ligitimate reasons to do so. I
    was playing around with the different fonts & put them all on top of eachother
    with transparancy. This gives a really cool effect, so I wanted to do the same
    with colours... The obvious choice for my colour range was CMY & RGB, but for
    that I was one alphabet short. I could've just left one colour out ofcourse, but
    I just couldn't decide which one plus this has been a really fun thing to do,
    making foreign receipts within the parameters of a 4x5 pixel limit. I'd actually
    like to do some more, but so far the only alphabet I can think of still doing
    is Arabic which would give me problems making it look that way. Arabic script
    is very stretched & with a 4 pixel width limit (of which you need at least 3 pixels
    to make a letter recognisable) there's not much left to stretch ;-)\r\nAny suggestions
    for strange alphabets are welcome ofcourse. The ones I've got so far (in case
    it's hard to tell) are: a regular one, Japanese, Greek, Russian, Indian & Celtic."

  body: "Thanks, I posted a good title as a reason to start a new typeface in a different
    thread (posted by Bald Condensed I think)... I've made quite a few changes by
    now, but since I'm working on an antique computer (OS 9.1, go figure) I can no
    longer upload images on Typophile since they've upgraded... I \xE0m however collecting
    a bunch of stuff to post here on an USB-stick & am planning to post it on a friend's
    computer one of these days. So keep your eyes open ;-)\r\nIt makes a really cool
    effect when using all different DBTT-typefaces in different colours & transparancies
    on top of eachother. I've been quite busy lately & I've got some nice things up
    my sleeves that I think will get some raving responses, but I still need to find
    the time to get organized & a good friend who'll let me use his/her computer to
    upload all my new stuff. But I promise -with the risk of sounding cocky- that'll
    be worth the wait ;-)\r\nIf you like this name, you'll pro\xE7bably also enjoy
    \"Hack the Pony\" which I derived from one of my favourite series \"Smack the
    pony\" ;-)"

  body: Really good work! I've some problem with two letters, the caps i and the M,
    may be the W need some more work too. BTW the gif don't give a good output. A
    pdf file would be better to appreciate your typeface.

    soba noodles. I found it in a recycled book at the library. Nowadays they use
    thermal printers and the receipt fonts are much smoother. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Japanese-Receipt_4374.jpg]\r\n"
