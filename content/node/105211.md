  is my own website/product that's been established now since 2005. It's a book cover
  plugin for Adobe Photoshop.\r\n\r\nWould you combine these three words or make them
  separate in a logo? \"Cover Action Pro\".\r\n\r\nI've tried making the word \"Action\"
  thinner to create more contrast but it just doesn't look right and giving one of
  the words color looks strange.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :-)\r\n\r\n-Mark"

  body: "Assuming that you want to keep the same general look (as opposed to a new
    logo), I'd keep them tight as one word. Otherwise you just have 3 words set in
    type rather than a distinctive logo. But you could certainly do something more
    interesting with it. \r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, one possibility would be
    to put \"Pro\" in a lighter weight (since I'd consider it the least important
    word in the phrase). Make the weight differences enough that the difference is
    immediately obvious.\r\n\r\nIf that font is available in a slightly condensed
    version, you might see how it looks to slightly condense the whole logo, to reduce
    the length a tad. (But don't try condensing it manually in Photoshop by reducing
    the width, as that will distort the height/width ratios of the strokes.)\r\n\r\nAnother
    possibility is to put \"Action\" in italic.\r\n\r\nBy the way, your Photoshop
    Actions look great. I almost bought it a few years ago when a client wanted me
    to convert a book cover image into a 3D book, but since the budget was tight I
    ended up doing it myself. Came out okay but not as good as what your product does.\r\n"
