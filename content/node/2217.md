body: Hi all <BR> <BR>Can anyone help me id&#39;ing the Title font at <a href="http://www.project-hardcore.be"
  target="_blank">http://www.project-hardcore.be</a> ? <BR> <BR>I need to do some
  artwork for this client, and they have no idea what font is used on their previous
  flyers etc.  The printers office got the designs in tiff format so no luck finding
  a name there either. <BR> <BR>Any help would be greatly appreciated!

  body: Although it looks similar, im afraid it&#39;s not the one.  I already tried
    What the font, but it didn&#39;t come up with any match. <BR> <BR>My client told
    me the designer that did that site had bought it so if he&#39;s telling the truth,
    it should be a commercial font aswell. <BR> <BR>Thanks for trying though <IMG

    something simular for you. They do commercial projects.
