  Geogrotesque. I would like something with a timeless feel, contemporary, solid,
  but somewhat friendly. I've been messing around with Vendetta. I've also tried Garamond
  ITC Pro. Since I don't have anyone I trust for their type feedback, I'm posting
  this here. I would love to locate something with lots of cut options moving forward.
  Vendetta seems to have a lot of options. \r\n\r\nAny recommendations would be awesome
  - thoughts on Vendetta as a complement to it would also be great. Just wondering
  if I'm off on that. If you all have better alternatives, I'd be very much open to
  exploring...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n"
