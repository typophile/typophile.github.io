  were difficult, then type for television would make you cry.\r\n\r\nTelevision pixels
  are rectangular rather than square. Furthermore, the colour pallet is constrained
  by legacy broadcast technologies and the type must appear smooth on even old low
  resolution television screens.\r\n\r\nIt may have been in the 1950s when the BBC
  designed their rounded font for broadcast subtitles. Does anyone know where to acquire
  a copy of BBC fonts for use on a PC?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, can anyone suggest an
  excellent font for use on low contrast transmission with rather big rectangular
  pixels?"

  body: "Hi Sii,\r\n\r\nI tentatively suggest that the breadth of devices is not a
    significant problem and that the pertinent term might be graceful degredation.
    My suggestion is that producers design content to look right on the least capable
    device. For example, a type for television would be intended for interlaced transmission.\r\n\r\nI
    feel that HDTV consumer products are shrouded in marketing hype and difficult
    to understand. For example, the up to date HDV 1080i encoding format has a rectangular
    pixel ratio of 1.33\r\n\r\nHi bert,\r\n\r\nThanks. Sadly, I cannot afford to pay
    much because I finished studies only last week. Do you know of a free source?

    example, the text may undercut statements in audio.\r\n\r\nHowever, my concern

    - just took some macro pics of my TV and the pixels are not square. \r\n\r\nAlthough
    i'm sure there are system that use specific bitmap fonts drawn for TV, typically
    I'd expect folks to use outline fonts rasterized to take into account non-square
    pixels - support for this has been built into the TrueType rasterizer since day
    one - to support CGA/EGA/VGA shaped pixels.   \r\n"

    and holds up well when it finally hits your TV at home. Generally sans serifs
    tend to work better for a greater volume of words at a smaller point size, but
    serifs can be sharp too.\r\n\r\nI've had a great many discussions, read many specs
    about proper and effective use of type on-screen, and done a lot of design for
    broadcast over the years, from main titles, to lower-thirds, to DVD menus, and
    my simplified guide-line is (for standard-definition): 18 pt. minimum, 230 for
    each R, G, and B value maximum, and watch the contrast of the type color/luminance
    to whatever the background values are. Television both is and isn't forgiving
    that way. And, designs properly prepped for broadcast look fairly awful on a computer
    (too murky and dull).\r\n\r\nAs for square pixels, designs all start out square
    (or should start square - that's a whole other discussion), get cropped, squeezed
    down to the desired output ratio (NTSC, PAL, whatever), and eventually get spat
    out to your TV screen essentially looking square. Yes, resolution is lost in the
    squeeze, but things get pulled back to a more proper proportion when you see it
    on your TV. Circles are circles again, squares look square, type isn't crushed
    any more. \r\n\r\nSo, it's less about the font chosen and more about the treatment
    and handling of the font in the design that will make or break its usage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n"

    I prefer the latter, but I do not remember seeing serifs on television - I don't
    actually watch TV unless its prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe technical details in the middle
    of your post are interesting. However, I lack relevant experience to fully appreciate
    what you have said.\r\n\r\nI understand that legacy broadcast signals have difficulty
    transmitting sudden changes in brightness. Have you used anything behind the light
    grey text to give it contrast against light backgrounds? :)\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    left is to spec, the right is 100% white or black (255, 255, 255, or 0, 0, 0).
    True whites and black should be avoided for everything on-screen, especially text.
    It's akin to avoiding a rich black for text on the printed page. I think Lucida
    Fax looks good at larger sizes (24 pt. in my example). The T serifs especially
    get muddy when smaller.\r\n\r\nThe colors are all pulled down to work with the
    background image - so that'll depend on what you are doing. I also added a very
    soft, centered drop-shadow to the first word in the Do list to give the type a
    little contrast to the back but keep it well within the numbers and gave all the
    words +10 tracking. The contrast will be exaggerated on most televisions so things
    will look bright and clear but there won't be any buzzing or fighting for clarity.
    I tend to go for softer contrasts for just that reason, so everything will work
    and be crisp and quiet. \r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"
