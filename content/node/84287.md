body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am having a bit of trouble with a character that came up while
  working with a magazine. There is this essay about northern Norway and a name came
  up, B\xF8rsskog. The only problem is that the <em>\xF8</em> character has acute
  character <em>\xB4</em> on top of it. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oaccent_4339.png]\r\nWe\u2019re
  using Syntax family for body text throughout the magazine.\r\n\r\nHow would you
  suggest I go around this oddity of a character? By kerning the characters on top
  of each other? Or should I create a new character with some font software? And if
  so, is there a \u201Ccorrect\u201D position for the acute accent?\r\n\r\nA lot of
  questions, I know. Sorry, and thanks in advance."

    (U+01FF).\r\n\r\nThen check to see if it has combining accents, which are zero-width
    characters with the glyph set to the left, so that it appears above the character
    preceding it. The combining acute is U+0301. You can copy it from this \xF8\u0301
    and see if it shows up correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of either of these, go
    ahead and kern them together, but be aware of what will happen if you ever need
    to copy the text and lose the formatting. For positioning, refer to the \xF3 in
    the font you're using."

    position it, but this my method: I let the imaginary axis of the acute accent
    emit from the top left corner of the letterform."

  body: "Thanks all, especially cerulean, I didn't for some reason realize that \xF3
    would be the way to position the acute character.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not the
    \xF8 character, but the fact that Syntax does not let me position the acute over
    the \xF8. As I copy and paste \u01FF to InDesign, it shows a missing character
    symbol (rectangle with an x on it).\r\n\r\nSince I need \u01FF several times (regular
    and bold weights) in the article I think I'll create this character for easier
    use. What would be the easiest way to do this? I don't at the moment have any
    software for creating characters for fonts. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n\r\nEdit:
    @Frank Frode: Yes, that is the last name of a person."

  body: "Okay, more trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the article another name with another unusual
    character came up. Pors\xE1\u014Bgu is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway
    (Wikipedia). Syntax does not include the eng/engma letter. I made my own version
    of this character combining n and j. What do you think about this?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng-02_6414.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    now I really do need a software to add letters to my fonts so any recommendations,
    tips and help would really be appreciated!"

  body: "Rikke, your eng is ok, j leg is the usual way to build this glyph.\r\n\r\nYou
    may try [[http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/|TypeTool]] to include new
    glyphs to your fonts, but first verify if their EULA allow you do this. There
    is also the free FontForge (follow the link given above by Janek) and the more
    complete and expensive FontLab Studio.\r\n\r\nYou can also consider a font update
    as Syntax has a standard, limited character set and the problem you face now would
    appear other times in the future."
