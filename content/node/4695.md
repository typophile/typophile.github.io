  body: Is there a chance you can view these fonts on OS 10.2.8? I am asking because
    a client has similar problems with some of our fonts. However, they are fine in
    Adobe apps. The problem only seems to affect apps that use the OS PostScript rasteriser.
    He works in OS10.3.? and I work in 10.2.8 and can&#39;t recreate the problem <BR>

  body: 'Thanks Bruno. <BR>I tried printing the font and it prints correctly, so it&#39;s
    something about the way it appears in Font Book and Suitcase.  Apple tells me
    &#34;we don&#39;t support 3rd party sofware or fonts&#34;.  Their suggestion:
    erase the drive and reinstall. I don&#39;t plan on doing that...seems too extreme,
    especially when it works on my G4 at home. <BR> <BR>Ellie'

  body: I have a feeling that the problem is not with the fonts or the apps but with
    the OS10.3.3 rasteriser. What you experience is that your font encoding gets jumbled
    up. Most of the fonts that you describe would have a plain Western European characterset,
    encoded either as Adobe Standard or Macintosh Roman. So, in theory they should
    work fine. What you experience however is the order shifts by a certain number
    of characters. I bet you that if you analyse your display the glyphs correspond
    to a certain character. That means Zcaron may always correspond to A, zcaron always
    to B etc. Also, you probably find that the spacing is out. In fact it is correct
    since it uses the spacing of the correct font! However, these are guesses, educated,
    though. <BR> <BR>Bruno Maag <BR>Dalton Maag Ltd

  body: You may also want to try and clear your font cache. My colleague who&#39;s
    had problems with some of our fonts used the Font Cache Expunger with some success

    <BR>Don&#39;t send the heavies round if it doesn&#39;t work, though. :-&#41; <BR>
