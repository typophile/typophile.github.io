body: "I'm designing an identity that is based around the aesthetics of the Streamline
  era. I'm having a hard time finding the script typefaces I want.\r\n\r\nIve scanned
  and posted two good examples here.  If anyone knows what font might be suitable
  to match them, I would really appreciate it!\r\n\r\nThe word \"streamline\" in the
  first ad is what I am after.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/streamliner_4547.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"City
  of Miami\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/miami_5236.jpg]\r\n\r\nI will
  also post the logo that I've worked out, in its current state. The script being
  used is \"loki cola\" which is an obvious rip off of the coca-cola script. I want
  to get away from that as much as possible.  But I do like the thick low contrast
  of the script.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/official-diamond-logo_6409.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  other suggestions for the design are more then welcome!"

  body: Have you checked out [[http://www.fontdiner.com/|FontDiner]]? Their "Casino
    Buffet" and "In-Flight Meal" font packs especially have some good ones for this
    project. Also, I know it's a little swoopier, but [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000213|Buffet
    Script]] may look nice.

  body: "I really like the buffet script (actually that whole collection is pretty
    amazing).  The price is a little high ($99.00 US) for this project, thats the
    only problem. Although it is an open type file, so I am sure its worth it.\r\n\r\nI
    made a very rough mock up with the buffet typeface...let me know if you think
    it works.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buffet-script-logo_4011.gif]"

  body: I think that looks great, Monster Maker. Buffet Script is a great investment;
    it goes well with the whole 40s/50s vibe as well as older stuff like you're doing.
    I've used it on my [[http://nigelewan.com|personal site splash page]] (currently
    being served off my home Mac).

  body: "Yes, I think the buffet script is the way to go...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
    any suggestions about the sans-serif typeface that was used for the word \"media\"?
    The font the was used was a freeware font called CaracteresL2 - which is a recreation
    of the typeface used for old British road signs."
