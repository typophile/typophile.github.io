  one for news and one for features, but  [[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/tryit/0,16469,1564647,00.html|the
  Guardian's]] redesign a couple of years ago - especially the mono-typeface all the
  way through - interests me.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for other families
  of typefaces that could be used throughout a newspaper for both body and headlines
  with a range of thicknesses and an italic style? We're looking at using 9pt on a
  10.75pt baseline grid for body and headlines up to about 90pt. We're more of a news
  magazine though, our format is just a little smaller than tabloid and printed on
  silk 115gsm.\r\n\r\nThe paper is going for quite a spacious look too, especially
  on feature pages.\r\n\r\nAny pointers would be great! Cheers..."

  body: Or maybe something by [[http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns01.html|Gerard
    Unger]]? He made a lot of specialized newspaper typefaces. Like Gulliver, Capitoleum
    and Capitoleum News.

  body: Thanks some great suggestions, I quite like Greta at the moment - although
    the 'g' does seem a little harsh, if that had a rounder 'g' then it could be the
    clear cut winner. Or maybe I shouldn't be so picky....

  body: "<cite>especially the mono-typeface all the way through</cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    is actually one family with five 'members', [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdnegyp.shtml|Guardian
    Egyptian]], [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdnsans.shtml|Guardian Sans]],
    [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdntegyp.shtml|Guardian Text Egyptian]], [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdntsans.shtml|Guardian
    Text Sans]] and [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdnagate.shtml|Guardian Agate]],
    with each 'member' comprising of several styles & weights. \r\n\r\nSo to say 'the
    mono-typeface' is a little erroneous and misleading! Are you actually looking
    for a sans/serif combo? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: DSType has the Leitura Type System, and it would match what you're looking
    for. I'm thinking of using it myself for a re-design that I have coming up for
    my school's newspaper :)
