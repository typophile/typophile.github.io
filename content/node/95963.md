body: "Hello everyone, \r\nthis is my first post. I just read and enjoyed a couple
  of threads and thought this might be a good idea for me as well. And I\u2019d like
  to show you what I\u2019m working on right now. I have some issues with my design
  because it\u2019s so hard for me to make a decision to my letters M, N, K and W.
  I\u2019m showing you the dilemma on the bottom of this post, so you know what I\u2019m
  talking about.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d really happy about some feedback because I have actually
  no exchange to this and I got no idea if it\u2019s good or not. So every opinion
  is welcome and \u2026 yeah, thank you!\r\n\r\nEnkle means simple in danish even
  if I\u2019m not danish but I meet a nice girl from Kopenhagen as I started designing
  this font and she taught me the language a bit. At this time there were just the
  Caps and I liked how \u201CENKLE\u201D characterized the font how I wanted. My inspirations
  for this font come from industry, harbour, road-signs, eastern europe, the russian
  \u201Ci\u201D, machines, wine- or apple-boxes, etc. \r\n\r\nThere is already a light
  (very light, close to thin ;)) version but I haven\u2019t worked on since months
  so I show you sometime later maybe. I\u2019m looking forward to finish it as a multiple
  master with light, regular, bold.\r\n\r\nThere is actually no Spacing or Kerning
  yet. I don\u2019t feel ready for this.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VHiSJ.jpg\"

  in \u201911 using my font.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1UJYr.jpg\" />\r\n"

    taper a bit the bottom inside sides of the \u201Cstumps\u201D."

  body: "Very nice! I agree with Riccardo about the W, and I think the same can be
    said for N and M. As it is now, the corners circled in red here:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MNKW_4306.png]\r\nlook
    as though they are pointing in, so could do with some optical compensation.\r\n\r\nI
    like the serifs an i, j and f. I think the eszett and cap eszett would benefit
    from having serifs on the left bottom too.\r\n\r\nYou need to be decisive about
    where to round corners - the 'character' version of K, for example, has slightly
    rounded terminals but the points on the arm and leg are sharp."

  body: I agree with the above; the funky versions are much more interesting. Did
    you already try to a lowercase /w/ the same way?

    already was. But not enough. Yes.)\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Paxpg.jpg\"

  body: "I think this is a pretty nice mix of conventional elements and funky ones
    - good job! Like the \"n\" is pretty normal, but the \"y\" is novel, without however
    being showy. And yes, go with the funky caps for sure.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\" (which,
    I don't know if you realize, happens to be very Danish*) needs a bigger gap between
    the head and the join. I would also think some more about its ear.\r\n\r\n* http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/danishg/\r\n\r\nIf
    the funky cap \"W\" has splayed sides, maybe the \"M\" should too? BTW I'm not
    sure about using those funky structures in the lc. My gut feeling is no (although
    as alts they'd sure be great).\r\n\r\nI would flatten the top of the \"t\".\r\n\r\nThe
    \"3\" is quite nice!\r\n\r\nI can't agree with Dave about the eszets - in fact
    I would remove <em>all</em> the serifs/bars, except <em>maybe</em> the foot one
    in the lc.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I meet a nice girl from Kopenhagen as I started
    designing this font</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFor some reason that happens quite often!

    looks interesting. Maybe I\u2019ll try out later, but I\u2019m actually fine with
    mine :)\r\n\r\nhhp, oh man, you made my day. I didn\u2019t know I drew a danish
    /g/, but I\u2019m very happy!\r\nI\u2019m already approaching your advices. Thanks
    a lot.\r\nBut remove all the serifs, really? This hurts. I think it\u2019s important
    for it\u2019s industrial charm. Makes it rougher, though. I get the feeling of
    an old wooden box or conex here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
