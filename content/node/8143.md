body: 'dear typophiles, <BR>i&#39;m posting my latest project: fra, a display font
  based on the lettering on a sketch by italian renaissance artist fra bartolomeo.
  <BR> <BR>i&#39;m presenting two versions. i started with a design, that wasn&#39;t
  very close to the original drawings. after i got feedback, that it was to reserved
  and geometric i decided to draw a new version. <BR>by now, i hate the first version,
  but i&#39;m not quite sure if the second attempt is heading in the right direction,
  even though i like it much more. please tell me what you think. <BR>is it too calligraphic
  ot should be even less &#34;sharp&#34;? what about the serifs, should i keep the
  edges or round them up? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55804.gif"

  body: I like the first &#40;close to the original drawings&#41; better <BR>but with
    the Y proportions and the angle you changed. <BR>Little bit round serifs make
    it looks more consistent, <BR>I think.  Very nice.  Where did you find that sketch

  body: hello alessandro,  <BR>i suppose you&#39;re talking about the second version,
    on the bottom of the page. <BR> <BR>what do you mean with the proportions of the
    Y?  <BR> <BR>there was a great renaissance drawings exhibition in vienna a couple
    of months ago. the lettering on fras sketch jumped immediately to my eye. <BR><a

    a friend who just graduated at <BR>Universit
