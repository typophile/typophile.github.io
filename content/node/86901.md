    the original looks like this, a similar one might be <strong>Jera Sans Bold JL</strong>\r\nhttp://www.eaglefonts.com/jera-sans-bold-jl-ttf-85028.htm\r\n\r\nthough
    the /Y/ doesn't fit very well and the /O/ of Jera is perfectly round.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ormaryd_enhanced_4166.jpg]"
