  to Antonio for the great feedback. In response to what you said:\r\n\r\n- The proportions
  are definitely not accurate. Shadowcliffe is only partially based on Trajan, as
  opposed to being a direct replica/revival. So I'm still taking plenty of artistic
  liberties.\r\n\r\n- The S is indeed wider by design; as much as I love the original
  Trajan S, I wanted Shadowcliffe to be a little more versatile, and as a result things
  like the ultra-narrow S have been adjusted for greater consistancy.\r\n\r\n- The
  J, K and R terminals did in fact \"swell\" too much. I was trying to give some of
  the standard glyphs a slightly more swash-like character, but as much as I like
  the idea I was going for, the execution never quite worked out. So I've reverted
  them to a more standard design.\r\n\r\n- The X was unintentionally top-heavy and
  should be fixed now."

  body: "I like it, well produced and balanced (probably <em>because</em> of things
    like the 'S' being wider than it is in Trajan and such).\r\n\r\nOnly thing I don't
    like -- which I also don't like in Trajan (amongst other things) -- are the serifless
    tops of the 'M' and 'N'. I understand that the historical precedents have this
    as well, but I think it makes them look as if they don't belong in the set.\r\n\r\nI
    like the 'R', the fact that it doesn't connect to the stem, and the leg as well.\r\nThe
    weight distribution could use some attention, but only here and there. For example
    compare the diagonal of the 'N' with the spine of the 'S'. But also the bowl of
    the 'D' compared to those of the 'C'/'G'. It's only minor, but nevertheless. :)"

  body: "Thanks for the comments. Funny how subjective this stuff can be: The missing
    serifs on the M and N are among my favorite aspects of the Trajan characters,
    and one of the reasons I chose it as an inspiration. :)\r\n\r\nYou're also right
    about the weight issues-- I noticed the S vs. N problem shortly after uploading
    the PDF, and have since fixed it. I also always knew there was something up with
    the C/G vs. D thing, but you've prompted me to take a more formal look at it and
    actually do something about it."

  body: Yeah, just a difference in opinion, but those characters are one reason why
    I don't use Trajan. Well... mainly the fact that it has been used to death on
    movieposters, but ok. ;)

  body: "Phew! Turns out the last character set was anything but finished. :) I just
    did another complete overhaul, doing a lot of very brutal testing, viewing test
    strings from a distance, from weird angles, etc:\r\n\r\nNOW, I think I might finally
    be ready to wrap up the character set. I did a lot of work across all of the weights/strokes/stresses,
    and made a rather bold change in the size of the bowls on the R, P and Thorn--
    they're considerably larger now, giving the face quite a bit more character than
    it had originally. They're so big they almost remind me of Goudy Old Style or
    something. But this is a titling font, and I think it makes sense. As part of
    my move away from the strangely narrow characters found in the Roman Trajan capitals,
    such as R, P and S, I think this to some degree inescapable.\r\n\r\nI should be
    able to knock out the rest of this weight within a few days, assuming I don't
    once again decide to redo the damn capitals. :) Here's what I plan on:\r\n\r\n-
    Union of WinANSI + MacOS Roman characters\r\n- Small caps for lowercase\r\n- Both
    lining and old-style figures (lining will be default, as this is a title font)\r\n-
    Complete set of numerators/denominators for OpenType fractions\r\n- Select swash
    capitals\r\n- Flourish ornaments\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, I'll at the very least
    be adding a considerably heavier bold weight, and possibly a light weight on top
    of that."

    left serifs look a bit too small, making the letter out of balance? As for everything
    else I stand by my sadly deleted comments, I like what I see."
