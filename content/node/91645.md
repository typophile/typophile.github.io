  to share with fellow font freaks the amazing results of an project I\u2019ve been
  working on at my studio, Studio RvdL. This expands on the work of researcher Frederic
  Gosselin who presented his <A HREF=\"http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/gosselif/FISET_PSYCHSCIENCE_2008.pdf
  \">findings</A> at ATypI in Iceland\u2026  \r\n\r\nThis cropped illustration (data)
  from the linked paper shows the parts of individual letters that are most important
  to letter recognition (left most column).  \r\n\r\nUsing this research data it was
  possible to create a perfectly legible ink saving font. So today I unveil for you
  \u201CMissink\u201D\r\n\r\nThanks, RvdL!"

    down a bit? I think tapering into the missing areas would help.

  body: "The initial image at the top, labelled \"Data\", shows in its first column
    a set of letters where the areas omitted from the typeface are more strongly blurred
    than the rest of the letter.\r\n\r\nIf I knew where that first image came from,
    and how it was generated, I could more seriously critique the specifics of this
    typeface.\r\n\r\nOf course, the date of original posting <em>is</em> relevant,
    as the actual typeface <em>is</em> totally unreadable, thus wasting ink instead
    of saving it. (Although texts consisting solely of numbers would be readable,
    but then no savings in ink would be realized over unmodified Helvetica or Univers.)\r\n\r\nBut
    even if it's an April Fool's joke, one <em>could</em> perhaps produce something
    useful out of it. An ink-saving typeface made of dots was recently proposed. If,
    indeed, the areas left in this typeface <em>are</em> those most crucial to legibility
    according to some legitimate source, then one could just put the rest of the letter
    back in, but screened to a light grey - and, presto, the typeface isn't a joke
    any more."

  body: "Ruddi, a message to you Ruudi,\r\nI\u2019m a fan of the Gosselin work on
    which this is based, and I think this is a very promising first attempt on using
    that data. Your font is missing the low frequency information that is adding the
    location of the letters, but I think exclusively preserving the high spatial frequency
    is surprisingly successful. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing about how well
    it reads. Since Missink is based on Arial, it would be interesting to compare
    it against Arial in a performance test, but since the peanut gallery will roast
    you for that, I recommend comparing it against a REfont.\r\n"
