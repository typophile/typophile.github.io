  body: "Have a look at Fenland by Jeremy Tankard which also has the tension between
    inner and outer curves.Yours might need to calm down a bit though. I see a nice
    s but an r whose arch is very light in comparison. Best of luck\r\n"

  body: Thanks for your advice, Gary.  This was one of my first type designs, and
    I'm actually kind of embarrassed of it now.  I totally see what you mean about
    needing to calm down, everything is shifted around to the maximum here. It's overly
    aggressive.  That said, it has been <a href="http://www.dafont.com/bounce.font">available</a>
    for free publicly for a while now.  So it's design is 'frozen' now.  Some people
    seem to like it.

    All rights reserved." when I get the info on the font file?

  body: Fontographer seems to have the current year and Adobe in the copyright field
    by default.  (is this not the case for others here?) I just never changed it.

    file and moved points around?

    didn't have a particular font to point to. My first impression when seeing these
    types of fonts (solid proportions and spacing, but unlovely and arbitrary details)
    is that they likely come from a beginner's fiddling with a pre-existing font.
    I thought the copyright information might confirm that suspicion. But obviously
    first impressions can be wrong. "

    this was totally a case of \"oh, lets take a plain sans and fuck up the interior

    old thing. I have much better work to show you"

  body: Can anyone confirm that Fontlab/Fontographer drops the Adobe copyright into
    font files? To me this seems very peculiar - I don't run Fontlab or Fontographer
    myself so I can't check.
