  other members, as my question seems to be a pretty hard one to answer to (even though
  I figured it was very easy, unlucky me!).\r\n\r\nI would like to find a font file
  similar to the one shown in picture. It was a font type WIDELY used in Italy (and
  elsewhere) in technical and scientific books preminently, but in other literature
  as well, from late 1800 to 1930 approximately. Oddly enough, nobody seem to remember
  the name.\r\n\r\nPlease note the aspect of capital letters, L, E and C in particular,
  with that kind of nice diagonal \"arrows\" as serifs. The look of lowercase letters
  is less important.\r\n\r\nhttp://img146.imageshack.us/img146/3928/fonthoepliyk3.jpg
  \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."

    digitizing it now and Patrick from Canda Type said to me, \u201C Ronaldson will
    be ready some time this autumn, hopefully\u201D.\r\n\r\n"

    a free search after your post, and the font shown there looks pretty much the
    same (if not identical):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/19769\r\n\r\nI wonder
    how they are progressing with their work... Do they read this Forum on a regular
    basis,  or would it be recommendable for me to write to them and let them know
    that I am interested as well?"

    it's a milestone of the Italian cooking style and very useful still today (it's
    from the early 1900s)."

  body: "Not exactly, it's from \"Il pasticcere e confettiere moderno\", Ciocca A.,
    Hoepli, Milano 1921.\r\n\r\nBut browsing here and elsewhere now that I know the
    exact name,  I've seen that the font has been actually used throughout western
    Europe in the twenties, and that it even went more far later. Seemingly, it was
    still in use quite recently (the seventies) in eastern countries like Romania.\r\n\r\nI
    must agree with other posters in parallel topics,  that this is truly a magnificent
    font face,  both elegant and formal,  easily readable,  but indeed with a spice
    of \"deco\" and a slight touch of Futurism given by those sort of arrow-shaped
    serifs."

  body: "ITC Tiffany (by Ed Benguiat) was based on Ronaldson Oldstyle. One noticeable
    difference is that the lowercase \"e\" in ITC Tiffany is tilted, but there was
    an alternate horizontal version. The italic is quite different, too. \r\n\r\nIt's
    cool that somebody is finally doing a digital version of Ronaldson Oldstyle. I
    think perhaps the existence of ITC Tiffany kept that from happening for a long
    time."

  body: "Oh, Hello Mark, it's a pleasure hearing from you again. If you recall (most
    probably not...) I purchased your \"Mostra Bold\" a pair of years ago. A superb
    font, I'm incredibly happy with it, and I'm actually planning to purchase your
    Mostra Heavy as well in the near future.\r\n\r\nYou're right, ITC Tiffany looks
    very similar, but somewhat looses that nice \"deco\" touch and gets more geometrical.
    I will perhaps wait for Rebecca and Patrick to finish their work, and then see
    which of the two fits best my needs. I'm not hurrying, after all. Thank you very
    much for your hint, and keep up your good work!"
