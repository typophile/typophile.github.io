  body: .ttf work well on MacX, I just tried Sylfaen from J Hudson from my Windows
    to MacX today! Does I have the right to that? don&#39;t know. But it work well.
    <BR> <BR>Depending of foundries licences, you can use that <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/transtype.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/transtype.html</a>. Its good software.

  body: I guess Sylfaen is actually an OT font &#40;TT-flavoured&#41;, that&#39;s
    why it works in both platforms.

    Every now &amp; again I have to use a font on a Mac &#40;I&#39;m a die-hard PC
    user - mostly because I&#39;ll die with hardly any money&#41; and CrossFont usually
    does a good job of making them usable on a Mac platform.  <BR> <BR>IIRC, the trial
    version is fully functional except that it doesn&#39;t do batch conversions. If
    you have a bunch of fonts, it might be worth the $45 for the license. <BR> <BR>Hope
    that works for you.
