body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm new to this forum, I'm new to typography, actually I'm not even
  close to be \"in\" typography. Here's my situation: I'm a graphic designer. I have
  a friend, who is a VERY talented calligrapher (85). A couple of years ago, I introduced
  him to computers. He does not feel he can take on learning new software. So, he
  asked me to digitize one of the scripts he designed. \r\n\r\nHere are two questions
  for you:<!--break-->\r\n\r\nA - I have an old copy of Fontographer which came with
  FreeHand Studio I bought many moons ago. As far as I know, this qualifies for the
  upgrade pricing for Fontographer as well as FontLab. Which would you recommend?\r\n\r\nB
  - The script he designed has \"dancing\" letters - letters end above and below the
  baseline. Is there a way to create a typeface which accommodates for vertically
  aligning letters to each other, similar to kerning pairs?\r\n\r\nAny comments are
  welcome, thank you for your time,\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nStephan"

  body: first, B - the best way to do this would be to implement [[OpenType]] programming
    into your font. this leads us to A- if you want to dive into the wonderful world
    of OpenType scripting, you will need FontLab to do the job.

    body: "Thank you Paul D. for your fast response. I was leaning towards FontLab
      before but read about a much steeper learning curve, oh well. \r\n\r\nHas the
      \"dancing\" letters functionality been implemented in a typeface before?\r\n\r\nThanks
      again,\r\nStephan"

  body: i'm not aware of any typefaces that currently do quite what you are describing.
    this is something i've wanted to experiment with myself, but haven't quite got
    around to it yet...
