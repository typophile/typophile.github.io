  RGB value to reflect this.\r\n\r\nCould someone in North America please do me a
  favour? I need the recommended RGB colour value for Pant 369 U and Pant 485 U. Could
  someone please look this up in the ColourBridge Uncoated?\r\n\r\nWe would have bought
  the Colour bridge uncoated, but there is NO EUROPEAN VERSION. For some reason only
  a coated version of ColorBridge exists in Europe. Who knows why, but there is really
  little point for is buying the North American version.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    color in the Color Picker, and translate it into your RGB or CMYK values. It's
    usually very close to if not exactly the same as the Color Bridge.\r\n\r\nTry
    it. You'll likely find that 369 is 94/160/69 and 485 is 228/91/80."

      216/65/62\r\n\r\nI'm a bit worried about these, as especially the red looks
      rather muted.\r\n\r\nThe values you've suggested are even paler (printed it
      looks like quite a solid colour).\r\n\r\nWhere do your values come from? \r\n"

    Photoshop's Color Settings I have the RGB Working Space set on Adobe RGB (1998)
    which it says is best for print work. On this setting it renders the colours with
    these values...\r\n\r\n369U - 112/156/079\r\n485U - 196/083/080\r\n\r\nBut if

    colours or just straight CMYK to "create" them, so I guess we all shouldn't be

      spots and RGB, often perhaps a big one -- one just cna't take a screen as a
      guide.\r\n\r\nBut I expect that a company like Pantone have done relative extensive
      research as to what RGB values to use so that that printing a colour on uncoated
      paper is, on average, adequately represented on most screens compared to representations
      of coated. That's why I wondered what their recommendations on RGB values are."

    sat in on a panel discussion about Pantone vs CMYK vs RGB many years ago when
    I was in Washington, DC, where someone asked the best way to \"convert\" spots
    to RGB and was basically told \"you're wasting your time. If you're designing
    something that will be seen on screen, your best bet is to go with hex definitions.\""

  body: "I agree with Linda. I would also note that Pantone color conversions tend
    to be more visually accurate (for print) in Illustrator and InDesign (which for
    me have always been identical). Photoshop almost always gives CMYK values different
    than both of those programs. Because of that, RGB values should also be off.\r\n\r\nI
    particularly have trouble converting blues from CMYK to RGB...which makes sense,
    given the different way print and screen see these colors. So your green might
    end up being off. Just go hex. Pick the closest match."

    conversion of Pantone to RGB for on-screen media. Just hold your swatch up to
    the monitor and take a best guess at it. Nearly all monitors are going to be different
    from each other, so you're really just aiming for a ballpark approximation anyways."
