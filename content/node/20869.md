body: "Recently graduating, I absolutely had to have business cards to hand out, and
  I noticed this unfortunate mistake. I double-checked my digital file, and it is
  not reflected there, nor did I encounter it in my proofs. I have no idea what happened,
  and this really is one of the first times I have had this type of issue in all my
  printing experience. Being affiliated with commercial print shops and presses for
  the past three years, employed in two different pre-press departments. this is one
  of the worst shifts or mistakes I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nNotice how far away the
  \"@\" is away from the email address. How BAD is this REALLY. Some argue that its
  like a natural stop before the server info, I say its a typographical nightmare.
  I have 1000 of these puppies, and I just can't seem to to get over this. Maybe the
  sagely advice of some other typophiles will calm my nerves.\r\n\r\n"

    or were they lowly pdf \"proofs\" from some digital print vendor? \r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    accept these prints and if they don't look like the proof then you have a leg
    to stand on. Most printers will reprint without question."

    using. However, you should find the proof the printer sent to you and print it
    out just to make sure the problem doesn''t show up in the print. '

    quickly, so i think that this is partially my fault for not noticing. I simply
    NEEDED the cards, and I just trusted there wouldn't be anything wrong with them.
    \r\n\r\nAside from all that, I was more so interested in how you all felt about
    the error, and whether or not it's as bad as I think it is."

    your showpiece - no matter how simple. It should reflect who you are and what
    you do. I would reprint and hopefully your buddy will do it for free - or halve
    the cost with you.\r\n\r\nIf you do reprint, how about losing the dash between
    the bracketed area code and the first three numbers in your telephone number?
    (602) 738-\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion. : )"

    reprinting as well. \r\n\r\nWe just sent back a 5,000 print run of cards for a
    client because the UV coating smudged the color on the back side of 1/5 of the
    cards. It's your right to be picky when your work/card represents you and your
    quality. "

  body: "With respect to your original design intentions, in all honesty I think it
    looks great with the space before the @.\r\n\r\nThink about the psychology of
    a user reading your card: \r\n\r\n1.\r\nuser thinks: \"right, what is the first
    user part of the e-mail address?\"\r\n---card facilitates legibility of this,
    by appropriately and easily indentifying and emphasising mdg2184 (which is a mouthful)--\r\n\r\n2.\r\nuser
    thinks: \"right got it, what is the end part after the @ symbol?\"\r\n--card facilitates
    legibiligy of @, with the extra preceeding space--\r\n\r\nThe e-mail address still
    looks like the same chunk of information, thanks to the bracket of your area code.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain
    with respect, I think all designers are guilty of getting caught up in TOO much
    detail, at times unnecessarily. You sound pretty tense, and I think it's best
    to accept it and look at the bright side this time."

    a hyphen or parentheses, not both.  Punctuating the address may be a good idea
    also, but a less serious error.\r\n\r\nDiscerning clients assume your business

    this stage of the game, what do you have to lose? Give it a try and if it doesn't

    than I was supposed to. I ordered 500, paid for 500, but actually got 1000+. This
    isn't a reason to not have them reprinted, but, I really do hate wasting. Recycling
    is great, but in the end, if you do a little research, the amount of resources
    it actually takes to run the recycling plants barely breaks even with the recycled
    product that is produced.\r\n\r\nB) It was a friend that printed them, and even
    though are relationship is good, people don't always take criticism well, and
    often times may not offer to do favors and such for you in the future. This job
    was small, and certainly was not a \"favor\", but, in the end I still appreciate
    it more.\r\n\r\nC) Sometimes, we all get caught up in our own designs, and nitpick
    them beyond belief. I asked many people before coming here about what they thought
    of this dilemma. This thread proves that \"good things do come from bad things\"
    as Andi had a great idea. That is exactly why I posted this thread.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    if you doubt or have questions about my credentials in terms of my \"experience\",

  body: Building on Andi's suggestion (which I fear may overwhelm a small business
    card) I once got a beautiful resume from a design student who had printed in non-repro
    blue the grid lines and some explanatory text for the various elements on his
    resume (A-heads, flush left rag right, x-height, etc). The whole thing was done
    in a very elegant understated manner - it looked good, was informative and showed
    off his knowledge.

  body: "T&K--\r\n\r\nYour ecomomic justification for not recycling is a cop-out:
    recycling, at least in part, reduces the number of trees that are logged to produce
    paper. Since trees are the largest consumers of the carbon dioxide that industrualized
    societies are producing in ever-larger quantities, <strong>anything</strong> that
    we can do to reduce demand makes the world a better place.\r\n\r\nRecycle the
    cards: the lack of separation between the street address and city and the use
    of parentheses <strong>and</strong> a hyphen in the telephone number are mistakes
    which <strong>you</strong> made. As they say, \"You never get a second chance
