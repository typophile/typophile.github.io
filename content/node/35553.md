    has a similar feel.

  body: "I agree...it's like a hodgepodge of several fonts. The crossbar on the \"e\"
    doesn't connect on the left (like Banjoman) and the \"g\" has a number 8 appearance
    (sort of like Al Koch Antiqua and Locarno - only connected). Long ascenders (like
    Bernadette and University Roman) and a large bowl on the \"a\"(exaggerated, resembling
    Kabel).\r\n\r\nAttached is a larger sample. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type-2_3961.gif]"

  body: It's is Poor Richard.  I made the first film font of that in 1965. I had it
    in 72 point metal and then was transformed into a photo-lettering face.

  body: To get the alternate 'g' used in the image, try the <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=PF00002401P2"
    target="_blank">Phil's Fonts version</a> - it's a tad less expensive to boot.
