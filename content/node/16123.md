  consistifying their suite.\r\n\r\nI know PS is not supposed to be a type-centric
  app, but trying to access OpenType* features without the glyph palette is a pain
  in the pooper. No one wants to trial-and-error all the contextual/stylistic/swash
  options in the Character fly menu.\r\n\r\n* Adobe's ballyhooed format!"

    each of the CS2 app, I did screen grabs and posted them on our site:\r\nhttp://vllg.com/files/cs2/\r\n\r\nOne
    hopes that CS3 will see the Adobe engineers speaking to each other and sharing
    their toys."

  body: I'd actually forgotten about that discussion, but found it in a round about
    way. I thought maybe possibly someone had written a plugin for Photoshop to give
    it a Glyph palette. That page was one of the first links that popped up on Google.

    button\" to Illustrator that will create logos for you?  Many clients already
    seem to believe that something similar exists.  ;-)"

    blam you've got all the glyphs.

  body: 'Welcome to typophile, assume you found this 5yr old thread via search. Unfortunately
    these are not the same thing. Charmap shows mapped glyphs. The Adobe glyph palettes
    show Unicode encoded glyphs and unmapped OpenType alternates. '

    been out for a couple o'months. Now I <em>know</em> there is no Glyphs panel in
    Photoshop CS4, but what about CS5?"

  body: Nope. The implementation and user interface for OpenType fonts has barely
    changed in any of the CS apps since OpenType support was added to each. The most
    significant change I've noticed in CS5 is that Illustrator now (correctly) has
    Contextual Alternates on by default, which I consider a bug fix, not a new feature.
