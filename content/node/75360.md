  the use of the font?\r\n\r\nI am setting up a new building that provides rented
  studio space to small creative businesses in London.  We decided we wanted to call
  it Rockwell House.  We've have used the Rockwell font for the logo and website.\r\n\r\nIs
  there an issue with us using this?  What are the parameters we should be aware of?
  \ Please can someone give me some advice on using this.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RW3_4167.jpg]"
