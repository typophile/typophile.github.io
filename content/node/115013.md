  Concept of Stripping Down the Serifs]].\r\nNow, let's go back to time, back to the
  Middle Age.\r\nI still wonder who first conceives sans serif typefaces based on
  blackletter calligraphy? Should I say <strong>Blackletter Sans</strong>, in other
  words, blackletter without terminals.\r\nWilliam Morris, Rudolf Koch or Tom Carnase
  and his [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/honda/|<em>Honda<em>]]?\r\nSome
  recent designers work and exploit geometric moduls combined with a heavy weight
  which give the flavor of blackletter: see [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/trigot/|<em>Trigot</em>]]
  or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/gryffensee/|<em>Griffensee</em>]].\r\nFell
  free to give your interpretation. Thanks for your input."

    This link should be good as a starting point: [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebrochene_Grotesk]]
    (Worst case, you can try throwing this link at a machine translator.)'

  body: "William Morris' [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/morris/troy/|<em>Troy</em>]]
    fits the actual concept of <strong>Neo-Blackletter</strong> or <strong>Blackletter
    Sans</strong>.\r\n\r\nTom Carnase's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/honda/|<em>ITC
    Honda</em>]]  (1970) has not only the <strong>Blackletter Sans</strong> leaning
    but combined with the weight of a slab serif/fat face if you catch my meaning.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/honda_6736.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    found another lead concerning the concept through Eric Gill's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/jubilee-rr/|<em>Jubilee</em>]].\r\nWhat
    do you think of Gill's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/jubilee-rr/|<em>Jubilee</em>]]
    and its cognitive bias?"
