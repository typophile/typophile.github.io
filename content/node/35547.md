  body: "When you are making the pdf do you do it by \"Export to\"?\r\n\r\nI'm working
    in CS2, but when I do it, I get many options before saving. The bottom box gives
    me \"Include\" and among the choices is \"hyperlinks\". Check off the box and
    give it a try.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Is it links within a document or from one PDF to another?\r\n\r\nI found
    that the links won't work if the title of the PDF has non-ASCII characters. When
    I named the PDF m\xE4rz.pdf the links didn't work at all.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n "

  body: Besides that, when you export and make the pdf compatible for Adobe Reader
    < version 5(?), than hyperlinks will not work.

  body: "\r\nThanks, Ralf. Good points to remember for the future. Turns out that
    in my attempt to figure out why it wasn't working I had layered invisible rectangle
    so it wouldn't work on the current one. Good thing I am tenacious. Once I figured
    that out it was a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nEvuka"
