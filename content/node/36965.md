body: I work on a Mac platform but I need help from production artists who work on
  PCs. I would like them to be able to remove my fonts when they are done with my
  projects. I had one gal download the 30day Suitcase trial but it crashed. I am not
  a PC person so I can't trouble shoot for her. I use it and it works fine on the
  Mac. I thought maybe there is a way to temporarily install fonts on a PC. Maybe
  an alias font folder that can be placed in the font folder? Any ideas? I don't want
  her to keep adding more fonts to her system because she is bogged down already.

    fonts to your production people.\r\n\r\nI work on a PC, and really haven't found
    a good font manager. I hear the latest (free) offering from Linotype is pretty
    good, but I haven't used it yet."

    It deleted essential system fonts!! I use Typograf. Works great. I have also used
    an older version of Suitcase. Main Type and Font Expert are good choices also.\r\n\r\nSharon"
