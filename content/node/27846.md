  uploading my .pdf file on Typophile I finally decided to make a screen capture (i
  can\u2019t believe how slow I can be sometimes\u2026lol) so this is only 2 slighly
  different versions of the new design of my business cards\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd here
  is my first post :\r\n\u201CGuys, you made my day (refering to the Kursivschrift
  discussion in the tatoo icon topic http://typophile.com/node/27828)!\r\nI finally
  decided to purchase Kursivschrift from Linotype and I am very (very) happy about
  it.\r\nNow, may I ask for your comments about this new business card of mine, I\u2019m
  still hesitating between the different \u201Cversions\u201D. It is going to be offset
  printed on transparent Cromatico\u2122 paper.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n(I was also
  thinking to use Digital Kauno\u2019s \u201C@\u201D)\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nPS : The other
  versions I wanted to show you at the begining were not very different from these
  2, only \u201CDESIGN CARE\u201D and my eMail address were either white on one or
  50% yellow on the other. Well, anyway, let me know what you think\u2026 Thanxxx"

    been more compact. The size contrast between dr and duckling is too small. Te
    ornament is too clip art, is it adobe wood type? there's a cafe here in oslo,
    right around the corner that has exactly the same ornament. I think the photograph,
    the \"me\"/\"my website\" and the ornament are competing, not complementing each
    other. kill some darlings, and reenliven them for a project where they are useful.\r\n\r\ngood

  body: "Hey thank you Alex for your comments.\r\nAbout the logotype : well, it's
    been my visual identity for 4 years now and I wasn't really considering changing
    it right now (I need my new business cards for a convention next week...) but
    you're absolutdely right about the ornament, it is based on an Adobe Wood Type
    one and I know that's it's not so classy nore original anymore but I'm still very
    fond of it (I can get very emtional ;-))... I was wondering more about the layout
    of the bCard rather than the logotype itself. I am going to post the other color
    versions in an hour or so. I like better the first version too and I'm just wondering
    about the arobase...\r\nAnyway, other critics are welcome.\r\n\r\nPS : At the
    begining Dr Duckling was the name of a (successful) graphic project that I did
    (print, web, tees) about taking CARE of the environment (nature heath care...)

  body: 'This may be because we haven''t seen the comps in colour, but to my mind
    the design feels messy: the out-of-focus-and-cropped image, the quirky font used
    for the logotype and address, the skewed and jumbled glyphs, the scribbled notes,
    the arrangement and proximity/distance of the text elements. You might be shooting
    for quirky, but really it just seems messy to me. The thing with self-promo projects
    is that like attracts like, so a messy design will likely attract clients who
    are also messy, and those kinds of clients are nothing but headache (and usually
    cheap as well).'

  body: Another way to translate the word messy, IMHO, would be no underlying structure.
    Even when David Carson was at his RayGun peek, there always seemed to be some
    sort of underlying structure. Business card design is a sticky-wicket. Very little
    space and if you choose to be assymetrical or random the lack of balance is exaggerated.

  body: "Whether \"messy\" is referring to a Carson-esque style or a general disorderliness,
    a question to ask yourself is \"if you don't really consider yourself to be a
    messy person, do you really want to present yourself that way with your business
    card?\"\r\n\r\nIMHO, the blurred background photo creates a hectic, hurried mood
    and the feeling that there is no underlying structure in the general layout heightens
    the sense of confusion.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    all, yes I am a big fan of David Carson's work (among others...), and find particularly
    inspirational his compposition \"science\" and sensibility.\r\nI have designed
    this business card working with ,well, certainly my own sensibility, finding this
    (maybe fragile) equilibrium, this warm feeling and humanist \"imperfection\" sense.
    And I was pretty happy with what came out of my research... Opposed to my usual
    alignment obsession which always kinda lead me to some sort of frustration. I
    just wanted to play with space and typefaces and basically with the whole thing...
    and had fun with this job. Although, you haven't seen the final touches...\r\nBut
    please show me what you think is a \"structured\" business card (opposed to my
    supposely unstructured/unbalanced one...)! I would really appreciate that...\r\nAnd
    sorry, for my english, I hope I make myself understood."

    my critique is simply \"are you communicating what you want to communicate to
    the people you are giving this card to.\" \r\n\r\nYou said that you didn't consider
    yourself to be \"messy.\" That made me think, \"if the business card does not
    represent the designer's style people may be confused when they come to you for
    work.\" \r\n\r\nI never meant to offend. I was just offering up initial commentary."

    for your posts, I didn't felt offended, don't worry...\r\nI've just been a little
    touchy recently (lack of sleep I guess)...\r\nI mean, I asked for your critics
    and this is what I get : critics...\r\nSo let's just say that I'm a bit masochist
    sometimes!\r\nMiss Tiffany, I like what you did with my bCard, I understand what
    you mean, but I thought that betting on the \"fer centr\xE9\" (visual vertical
    center, does that make any english sense?) would still give some kind of structure
    to the lay-out, my only problem with your lay-out is that \"design care\" is a
    part of my logotype and is usually aligned with the vertical axe of the second
    D, I also placed my eMail address aligned vertically with the end of design care
    and the \"arrow\" on top of the ornament and try to balance space around those
    block...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm gonna post my last touch-ups in a few hours (after
    sleeping...) and will also make new ones thinking of what yall have been suggesting
    or making critics about.\r\n\r\nOne more thing... I posted another thread the
    other day, proposing that everyone post his own business card, to have a little
    gallery of how graphic designers / typographes, etc introduce themselves nowadays...
    Would you like to participate? That would be fantastic!"
