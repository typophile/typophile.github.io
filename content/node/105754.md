  scouring the web for a week and couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\nI'm an artist and
  was recently asked to make a font for my studio. I had never done anything like
  this before and other than photoshop could only use freeware. So I  used photoshop
  to make the paths, exported to Inkscape to make the font file and then to fontforge
  to do the kerning and then generating as a TTF.\r\n\r\nI have hit a few snags however
  and try as I may I cannot sort them out so I have come here to hopefully beg some
  help from people with much more experience in this area than I.\r\n\r\nMy font works
  in Fontforge metric window. The kerning works perfectly. When I export it and I
  look at the font preview window the glyphs are kerned. However when I open wordpad
  and MsWord the kerning is no longer there. What I don't get is that in notepad the
  kerning works as intended (though in notepad it creates black squares when I hit
  'space'). I am certain this is something small that I have just overlooked but I
  cant seem to figure out what it is.\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light on this please
  as I really don't want to have to spend another week banging my head against fontforge.
  If you need any more info I will be checking this regularly and will be able to
  post anything that will be useful. \r\n\r\nThanks for any time / help. It is much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    \"space\" 0r 0x0020. Just select it, right click and \"set width\".\r\n\r\nThe
    kerning in Word is not activated by default. To get it you need to select \"Format
    &gt; Font &gt; Advanced\" and check \"kerning\" and specify the smallest point
    size for which you want kerning to be applied."

  body: "Hey thanks, that was what we needed! As I created this font by importing
    an SVG file from inkscape I didn't have a space character. I re encoded it as
    Windows Latin and then altered the space character as you suggested but it still
    causes the black box. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: Thanks for your help, its looking great now. If I could only make fontforge
    stop crashing I would work into this more but as it is I think this is as far
    as I can get it. Very much obliged for your help.

  body: Welcome! As for FontForge on Windows, I can't help. The versions of FontForge
    I use are for the mac.
