  body: "Unfortunately, as previously said, both are most probably hand-lettered or,
    at least, (heavily) customization of existing typefaces.\r\nHave a look to [[https://www.merchline.com/hydro74/category.3998.c.php|Hydro74]]/[[http://www.legacyofdefeat.com/|Legacy
    Of Defeat]], [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/|Letterhead Fonts]], [[http://www.dafont.com/billy-argel.d1573|Billy

    and [[http://www.dafont.com/anton-krylov.d2610|IFC Anton Krylov]] would probably
    give you some good base material."

  body: thanks Guys, i assumed they were customised typefaces. i have since found
    some very similar ones and will be trying them out. Thanks guys, looks like i
    am going back to hand lettering again to create a similar look.
