  body: "Come on Seb we can do better than that! No type is too small for a typophile
    :) Im fairly certain this is Adrian Frutiger's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/vectora-lh/75-bold/|Vectora
    Bold]], characterized by the small capital letters and the looped 'g'.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arkitip_6061.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    website has used either a different version of Vectora than mine or it has been
    rendered with something other than Photoshop. Anyway it's too close to be another
    typeface I would suggest."

  body: Ha Naoise! It seems that you certainly did... well done. And shame on me for
    being lazy on calling a 'safe' shot.
