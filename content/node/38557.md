  in the borough. Considering that his 'work' goes for up to a million nowadays, (the
  price that Brangelina supposedly paid for one of his pieces), it would be a shame.
  The council should be encouraging people to go on a 'Banksy trail' walking tour,
  not obliterating these works of art. It adds interest to an otherwise not very interesting
  area.\r\n\r\nHere's a witty bit of vandalism I spotted last time I was in The Smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vandalism_4637.jpg]"

    protected with a sheet of glass. It\u2019s a shame when a graffiti artist actually
    has talent and skill and nobody appreciates it, but I guess that sort of comes
    with the territory."

    entity to get into the game of legislating artistic merit.\r\n\r\nBesides, look
    at the kerning on that piece. It had to go."

    figure sitting between the S and M.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell, it's probably for the
    chop as well.\r\n\r\nNever heard of EINE - is he/she responsible for all those
    large caps on shop shutters in that area?\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
