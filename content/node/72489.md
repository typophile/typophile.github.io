  scan (doctored, original in metallic silver over brown) is from a series of touristic
  brochures made in Italy no more than five years ago. I have to make a new one of
  those, but for the life of me cannot identify this font (and the original designer
  is proving extremely hard to get in touch with). What The Font has a hard time with
  it and brings to no conclusive results. The same goes with Identifont and fontshop's
  type navigator. \r\n\r\nResults obtained from research and posting elsewhere suggest
  an Emigr\xE9-esque look to it (Modula is a tiny bit similar, esp in the M) or Neville
  Brody (FF Dome) or even FF Dog (Paul Sych). In my opinion it has a 1990s feeling
  to it, but other than that I'm starting to be completely stumped.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nd"

  body: This is a face called Decco Modern, designed by Andy Hullinger in 1993 (according
    to an old type catalog I have). I'm not quite sure where you can get it now. It
    was originally distributed by T-26, but they don't seem to carry it anymore.

    href=\"http://www.free-fonts.com/font/modern.html\">semi-abandoned webpage</a>).
    \r\n\r\nApparently neither T-26 nor AGFA/Monotype/Fontshop (found a few references
    to them by way of Google) seem to be carrying it."

  body: It was almost pure luck that I was able to find it. I knew it looked familiar.
    Something in the back of my mind told me to look in the Precision Type catalog
    (1995). I flipped to a page in the back, where individual distributors' offerings
    were listed, and there it was.

  body: "Mark, You should be a detective!\r\n\r\n_dario, I'm happy to anyone a copy
    free of charge.\r\n\r\nHa ha! Ironically, I was lecturing/demonstrating to my
    design students about \"googling\" yourself and this link popped up onto the projector.
    \r\n\r\nWell, class has just ended and I wanted to reply. The original lettering
    was based on some headlines I created for a Reebok print campaign at Leo Burnett
    in the '90s. Those headlines were in a \"distressed\" style, and at the urging
    of Carlos Segura and Scott Smith (back when we were first starting T-26)  I created
    a \"more complete\" alphabet in two weights - Normal and Organic.\r\n\r\nMy apologies
    in advance for all the kerning you'll have to suffer through!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deccosample_5522.jpg]"
