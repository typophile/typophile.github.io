  body: That&#39;s what I thought! It looks like what you get when you don&#39;t embed
    the fonts into a pdf. This was driving me crazy.

  body: He he. I feel better now. I don&#39;t understand why the cap height is so
    off - usually if anything caps are shorter than the ascenders, but here they tower
    over them. It wouldn&#39;t be such an egregious looking font otherwise.

  body: Is there a way to get typed text to be that font &#40;Adobe Serif&#41;...I&#39;m
    trying to make a new sign match that old sign&#39;s text??  Or is there another
    font that&#39;s close? <BR>Thanks, <BR>nicole

  body: That&#39;s pretty pointless Nicole. It&#39;s not a real font, it&#39;s just
    a &#34;ghost&#34;  <BR>that mimicks what it&#39;s supposed to be. Read the link
    in my post above.

  body: Nicole, just use Times New Roman bold and a plus it will look better. Only
    type geeks will know the difference. Readers will be interested in the content
    of the message.
