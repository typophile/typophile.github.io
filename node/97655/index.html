  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>There&rsquo;s been a major change in Apple leadership, and conceivably it could affect Apple&rsquo;s use of fonts down the road.</p>
<p>Senior vice President Scott Forstall, who many thought might be the next CEO when Tim Cook eventually retires, has lost his job. The Apple press release puts it more delicately — &ldquo;Scott Forstall will be leaving Apple next year and will serve as an advisor to CEO Tim Cook in the interim&rdquo; — but his duties have been reassigned to other vice-presidents and it&rsquo;s likely that he&rsquo;s being kept on for a few months as &ldquo;an advisor&rdquo; just for contractual reasons.</p>
<p>Forstall was senior vice president of iOS Software, and his duties included overseeing software interfaces.  Jonathan  Ive (Apple&rsquo;s senior designer) will now be in charge of interface design. It&rsquo;s been previously known that Ive and Forstall had very different views on interface design.</p>
<p>Time will tell if Ive makes any typeface-related changes now that he&rsquo;s in charge.</p>

<p>I am not sure what you mean by that. I use a Mac for personal work but my employer is PC all the way. My work PC renders type very poorly compared to my Mac. I have done every thing I can think of to optimize type rendering on my work PC but it is still nowhere near my Mac for quality. Granted, I am but a small cog in a big machine and don&rsquo;t have full admin privileges, but really, it you have to be a rocket scientist (with full admin privileges) to get decent type rendering out of your computer your computer has room for improvement.</p>
<p>Just sayin'.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting Ive doesn&rsquo;t give enough of a darn to do anything drastically awful&hellip; Not that I have a clue, but who cares about type? Actually&hellip; External antennas up the hoo-ha all day long, but type? Not even half as sexy as external antennas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Apple ordered to re-write &lsquo;inaccurate&rsquo; Samsung statement</p>
<p>Apple has 48 hours to re-write a statement on its website relating to its design rights dispute with Samsung, UK judges have ruled.</p>
<p>Apple was forced on 18 October to publish a message making it clear that Samsung had not infringed the iPad&rsquo;s registered design.</p>
<p>However Samsung complained the statement Apple had posted did not comply with the court order.</p>
<p>Judges agreed and have told Apple it must be removed within 24 hours.</p>
<p>A new, compliant version must then be posted.</p>
<p>Michael Beloff QC, representing Apple, told judges that the company had thought that it had complied with the court order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not designed to punish,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not designed to make us grovel. The only purpose must be to dispel commercial uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked that the company be given 14 days to post the replacement - but the request was firmly denied.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Longmore told Mr Beloff: &ldquo;We are just amazed that you cannot put the right notice up at the same time as you take the other one down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Robin Jacob added: &ldquo;I would like to see the head of Apple [Tim Cook] make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for the Apple company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apple told the BBC it did not want to comment further.
&lsquo;Horse&rsquo;s mouth&rsquo;</p>
<p>Samsung complained that the notice posted by Apple was &ldquo;inaccurate and misleading&rdquo; because it added comments about other rulings in Germany and the US that had gone in the iPad-maker&rsquo;s favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has received enormous publicity and has perpetuated confusion as to Samsung&rsquo;s entitlement to market the Galaxy tablet computers in issue,&rdquo; a Samsung lawyer said in a written statement to judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has created the impression that the UK court is out of step with other courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s ruling applies to the whole of the EU.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 A UK judge said Samsung&rsquo;s product was not as &ldquo;cool&rdquo; as the iPad, and would not be mistaken for it</p>
<p>The court order is the latest twist in an ongoing legal saga involving the two companies.</p>
<p>Apple brought the case to the UK courts, alleging that Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Tab 10 had infringed the design of its iPad.</p>
<p>But in July, Judge Colin Birss disagreed on the grounds that Samsung&rsquo;s product was not as &ldquo;cool&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His ruling meant that Apple was denied the opportunity to impose a sales ban on Samsung&rsquo;s products.</p>
<p>Apple was unsuccessful in appealing the ruling, and was ordered to place a notice on its website, newspapers and magazines explaining that Samsung had not infringed its designs.</p>
<p>The intention, judges said, was not to make Apple &ldquo;grovel&rdquo;, but to remove &ldquo;commercial uncertainty&rdquo; surrounding Samsung&rsquo;s products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A consumer might well think: &lsquo;I had better not buy a Samsung - maybe it&rsquo;s illegal and if I buy one it may not be supported&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sir Robin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apple itself must (having created the confusion) make the position clear: that it acknowledges that the court has decided that that these Samsung products do not infringe its registered design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The acknowledgement must come from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a typography angle though. The judge required the use of &ldquo;Arial size 14&rdquo; for the original notice - Apple used 14px ;-). The revised version needs to be 11pt, apparently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul is dead&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting way off topic here, but the &ldquo;Paul [McCartney] is dead&rdquo; rumor was based in part on the Abby Road cover, in which Paul was barefoot and out of step with the others, and some viewed it as a symbolic funeral procession. I recently saw a link to some outtakes from that photo session which I thought were interesting.</p>
