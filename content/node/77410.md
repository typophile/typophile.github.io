body: "Any thoughts on my logo please :) thank you!\r\n\r\nHere is the company and
  it's background explained:\r\n\r\nI am to brand a) the ice cream as a high-end product,
  and b) the farm itself, which is an attraction for families, children, school groups,
  etc. The decision has been left to the designer to decide on factors such as the
  USP and target market. After visiting the farm, trying the ice cream and seeing
  it in situ at the Hollies Farm Shop, I have decided the products USP is the fact
  that it is made fresh on the farm; from the milking of the cows to making the ice
  cream, everything is done at the farm. I wanted to get the high-end feel to the
  brand, as well as keeping the 'farm fresh' feel to it, as this is my USP. Below
  you can see my finished logo :) It is intended that the logo has a real 'stamp of
  approval' feel to it. It feels very farm/homemade like without cheapening it. The
  colour was simply chosen from the colour of the farm building, which I think works
  really well. The subtle arching of the 'Cheshire Farm' is supposed to hint at hills
  and greenery. The 'EST' mark as I mentioned before, is intended to add the seal
  of approval feel, as well as perhaps expense and heritage. The typeface is hand
  drawn by myself.\r\n\r\nhttp://i52.tinypic.com/2v2bh4x.png\r\n"

  body: "This looks great, and I'll bet the client is thrilled. Some technical-based
    opinions:\r\n\r\nI adore light and hairline weights, but this setting may not
    reproduce well at smaller sizes (especially when ink may fill in the knocked out
    type).\r\n\r\nThe overall feel is wonderful. I wish, though, that each line had
    the same visual weight on the stroke. \"Cheshire Farm\" is light, \"\u2014 ice
    cream \u2014\" is heavier, and \"Est. 1986\" is split-hair thin. There's not enough
    contrast between the three lines to make them feel like the contrast is intentional.
    This logo would look just right if each line didn't look like it was written with
    three different pencils. I hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nn.b. \"myself\" is reflexive.\r\n\r\nNice
    work!"

  body: I agree with the previous comment that it should be a little heavier, especially
    when reproduced in a smaller size. And I'd like to see the 1st & last letters
    equal distance up from the bottom of the logo for symmetry; currently it looks
    like the M is higher than the C.

  body: This looks great! Nice one. Agree with the comments having problems at smaller
    sizes though. But what applications will it be used on? If it can stay fairly
    large on tubs of ice cream and whatever else, then you should be ok with hairline
    type - it would be a shame to lose that because its so perfect for the brand.
