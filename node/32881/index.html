		<div class="commentbody">Fine work, especially in the black weight. You must be getting some formal training?

The spacing is too tight if you intend this to be used for text setting (which it really can do, despite it's buoyant character).

I dig your effort to keep things compact, but consider giving the descenders just a little more room. The 'g' is distractingly cramped anywhere near 10 pt.

It doesn't serve the Black weight well to show it at 10 pt. as it's really best for display use.

The angled strokes really shine on the italics.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I think it takes real courage to post a font on Typophile, Toby. I think it's excellent. Stephen's right; fine work. 

Here are my comments for what it's worth:

I wonder if the five weights fall in the right position on the scale. I think you can afford a medium (in between the current medium and bold). The current medium looks like more like a regular to me. I also think your bold might need to be a touch heavier to work with the existing medium. I'd like to see a regular and bold together.

You may consider that the 'a' is Zai's signature character but it is an stumbling block for me (Am I alone?) I wonder if it will cost you sales or generate sales (you may not care about income). Maybe it is worth including more than one as an OpenType alternate. The fact that it looks like it is an inverted 'e' could be contrived/gimmicky? I'm sure someone else with more experience might care to comment on this.

Suppose you go with the existing 'a', is it me or does the centrestroke look optically steeper than that of the 'e'? Maybe that doesn't bother you.

The tail of the 'g' appears to get shorter as the font gets bolder. Put the thin 'g' next to the black 'g' - I am not sure if they are alike enough?

Are the 'C'/'c' and 'K'/'k' too narrow?

To me the '4' appears to slope backwards because the upper left stroke seems too upright and perhaps needs to echo the angular downstroke on the '7' more.

The question mark '?' looks out of place when put next to '3', '5' and '8' (not that it has to be like these numerals but I imagine you're trying to get commonality where possible).

I think the centrestroke of the ampersand should perhaps extend more towards the 't' part of the glyph. The Black ampersand looks to be falling backwards.

Sorry if I sound negative, not meant to be so.

		<div class="commentbody">I think I´ll stick to that "a", and maybe have a one-storey a as an alternate. It is, as you say Nick, the signature character. After all there are quite a few faces with an ordinary a to choose from. I guess some will like like it and some not. And I don´t think there´s anything wrong with the shape, neither logically nor calligraphically (look at Galliard), one´s just not used to it.. 
Yeah, the spacing is too tight for text, but that´s fairly easy to fix, lowering the descender is somewhat more complicated...lots of characters resting on it. Maybe I could raise the bowl on g instead..
I agree the Medium is more like a Regular, is just didn´t want a predetermined standard weight. I think it works fine with the Bold (check out new pdf). 
About the questionmark, I found this shape to be the least space consuming one. 
I´m not sure about the black ampersand falling backwards, I think the crossbar keeps it on its feet... but I´ll look at it!</div>

I'm just not sure if medium is the right name.

Stephen: <em>Some anglo types have much wider ‘C’s, but those of other types, particularly in Germany, are much more narrow.</em>

Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman. What about the 'K'/'k'? Is that an English thing too?

Stephen : <em>Regular is a bad weight name anyway. Along with Normal.</em>

Medium suggests to me a bolder weight. Is it time a new name was invented as a replacement for Regular/Normal? Even Book is presumptuous.

Toby: <em>I think it [the Medium] works fine with the Bold (check out new pdf).</em>

It's a very good contrast. Thanks for the illustration. Does the black work in the same way as the Bold? Not that it has to, but if you are genuinely offering a non-prescriptive naming structure then IMO you need a weight that will bold up(?) well with the light and the thin too. Plus a suitable bold weight of a font is often two weights away from its lighter counterpart. </div>

I´d need to use a double junction for them to be wider, and that wouldn´t fit style.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it's a wonderful type family. I will however echo some of the previous comments; the descenders are indeed a little too short for my liking and I'd be concerned about them getting lost on some presses, especially on newsprint. It might be a lot of work, but at this stage where you've already committed so much time a little more might be worth it when shopping this around to vendors.

The regular 'a' is a bit different and I'm not sure I like it. The idea of having an alternate in OT would be nice. It's like the '@' symbol in DIN it's unique but every job I've worked at and we've used DIN for a client we've had to sub out the symbol with one from another font. I'd hate for that to be the case here. </div>

Yes, it's great!

<em>The regular ‘a’ is a bit different and I’m not sure I like it. The idea of having an alternate in OT would be nice.</em>
I really like the "a", but it could cause problems. A more common alternate would be certainly helpful in some cases.

Everytime i look at the specimen, i find new details i really like. It's almost like a treasure hunt.

One thing,though: I really think you should make a more neutrl alternate 'a'. maybe even two; one single-storey and one "normal". the sharp corner on the lower bowl stands out a lot, and cold be a reason to drop the font, espcially for heading/display use. Also, the 'g' i too tight i think. 

please let us know when it's available for purchasing. 

How long have you been working on this  one?

For every single thing, there can only be 1 pioneer & by now, pretty much everything has been done before at least once. The only thing left for us to do is to make a good collection from all the things we like & try to add some personal flavour & I for one think Toby's done a hell of a job with his Zai font. An alternative "a" may be a good compromise (especially for larger type), but I'd leave the original in. Set in texts in regular size for reading it doen't even stand out that much.</div>

I can see where you could be concerned, and doing what I and Stephen are suggesting will not be easy. Some might have said the same thing about all the weights you have. Personally I am confident that your font's personality is strong enough to lend itself to Small Caps or a text face optimized for very small text etc. Moreover there is help here on typophile to get you there. And there might be other options as well. Certainly the bigger the face's family the better it is likely to do commercially I think. Still, it's your thing; and after doing such good work you may simply want a break!

Looking at the all caps setting of the word TRANSPOSE I was struck at the way the caps feel like sign painter's letters. 

Would you talk a bit about the feeling or 'voice' you feel the font has, your intent for the font, and the context in which it was made?</div>

I can confirm that is true. Sometimes this is an unfortunate truth as some designers expand the family to tens of styles before polishing the base weight and width. But that is not the case here.</div>

Yes, handpainted signs was an inspiration, and old, bold letterpress stuff like those modelling for FB Rhode and HTF Champion. I guess I wanted to make a more contemporary version, with some of my own personality in it too. First I thought of it as mainly a headline face (it was then consisting of three bold weights), but then I tried expanding it to lighter weights, and found it worked quite well.</div>

I saw something that may look alike a glitch. Take a look at the UC S black italic. Inner bottom curve doesn't look completely smooth. At about two o'clock it looks like ti has a slight bump.

Are you making this family for a certain client of yours or is this font going to be publicly sold by some foundry?</div>
