  body: "Thanks, Bald Condensed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not in a position to spend
    $30 on a font I'm never going to use again.  I think that Alpin Gothic #3 (http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=203181)
    is probably a closer match, but it still doesn't do me any good, because it's
    a commercial font as well.  Is there a free font out there that'll work?"

  body: you want free? try impact... most computers with any Microsoft applications
    will have that on there. if that doesn't work, scroll through your font menu and
    find something close.

  body: "Maybe $30 for one use can be too much for some people, but Franklin is a
    highly serviceable typeface that you'll come to increasingly rely on once you
    start using it. Also, does your version have the Compressed style? Because if
    you squoosh it manually/mechanically, it's definitely not going to work [as] well.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
