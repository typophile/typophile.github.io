    I see American movies dubbed into Finnish without subtitles. <BR> <BR>So stop
    it already. <BR> <BR>

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s like Herring. You have to get
    used to the &#34;taste&#34;! I watched that &#40;spelling&#41; Moscow. The Reindeer
    Lord? Quite the flick. I heard that wolf song by that famous Laplander. I owned
    a wolf, he got  old, walked away into the bush and died. The wolf song made me
    think Shylo came home. Dark as a coal mine these days. Do you get the Northern
    Lights where you are? <BR> <BR>You are close, we should meet one of these days.
    I am not really as mean and nasty as I pretend. It&#39;s just my role. I am supposed
    to be a bitter old grump. <BR> <BR>I never used comic sans or courier when I did
    subtitles. One face they used lots of at BBC was Lanston&#39;s Globe Gothic. It
    got lots of use. <BR> <BR>We have a Bruce Rogers face that was never completed.
    There was interest in having us complete it for a movie. I worked on lots movies,
    what a pain.

  body: I guy from Suomi once asked me if i had a bottle opener.  I opened his beer
    with a knife and his jaw dropped. He didn&#39;t know that trick, which made my
    jaw drop. One would think the Finnish knew all the knife tricks.  <BR>I remember
    very beautiful type in Finnish cemeteries though. And nicely raked patterns. <BR>
    <BR>Gerald, I read your post as &#39;I have a Bruce Rogers face that was never
    completed&#39; . &#40;Interpreting &#39;face&#39; as &#39;the part of your head
    that has the most openings&#39; not &#39;typeface&#39;.&#41; Which is a very cool
    line.

    ends about the beginning of December. This year was cosmically out of this world.
    The sun was causing electrical disturbances. <BR> <BR>Not many northern lights
    in Summer. If there was you wouldn&#39;t see them. I read a book until four in
    the morning without any lights on. <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>It would be nice if they were available with a few more goodies -- display

  body: There you have it. We hung a sign asking the dead to lie down so we could
    distinguish them from the living. <BR> <BR>Alcoholic comatose workers would sometimes
    become victims of premature burials. We had to take the sign down. Lanston actually
    did have a  dead worker in its&#39; office. Rather interesting story. Goudy happened
    to be at the plant and sent a memo to Sol Hess complaining about the smell. Apparently
    it was rather varnishy hot in Philadelphia. This was before the USA got bombed
    in Pearl Harbour. The fellow was an optical genius from Germany parked at Lanston
    &#40;before my time, be kind now&#41; when we were looking into photocomp. Remember
    brass was predictably going to be hard  to find. I would love to tell the rest
    of the story but you will have to read the book. <BR> <BR>But thanks for the tip
    Hrant. <BR><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3410547.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3410547.stm</a>
    <BR>I almost missed the end of the article. <BR><i>Finnish citizens pay among
    the highest taxes in the world, but enjoy one of the best welfare systems.</i>  <BR>
    <BR>I knew I was doing something wrong. I have been missing out on the <i>enjoy.</i>
    <BR> <BR>So we should have this Northern Typographers thinga-ma-jig. Maybe we
    should start an new thread?? <BR> <BR>I had always welcomed <i>movie title typography.</i>
    We only did several but we set and printed many <i>dummy newspapers.</i>  I had
    to invent all manner of headlines and advertisements. One ad I wrote had a rather
    bold headline. <BR> <BR><b>Wet Nurse Needed</b> <BR> <BR>They shot the scene.
    I must report, <i>movie directors</i> have very good lungs. <BR> <BR>When I saw
    the movie I must admit my face was red as a beet. <BR> <BR>In any event I found
    the workings for the Bruce Rogers&#39; face, I wonder if I should finish it. There
    are missing characters. A good job would be when you could not tell who did what.
    But the face is not without its&#39; charms. It would make a great movie title
    face for the right movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
