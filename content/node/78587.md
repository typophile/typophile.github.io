  it for the type on a wedding invite. I got as far as Optima, but it isn't![img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_4628.jpg]

  body: "It seems close to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/aperto/\">Aperto</a>,
    but it also resembles <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/optima/\">Optima</a>.
    Almost like a mix of the two faces. \r\n\r\nI'll be curious to see if an exact
    match is found.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
