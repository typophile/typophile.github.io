  body: "I think it has a strong resemblance in general style and shape to a freeware
    font called Luxembourg (see the sample <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script03Pg5.html\"
    target=\"new\">here</a> near the end of page). Based on this, I would guess this
    is a custom work, but I would be interested if anyone knows more.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: 'The "St Etienne Daho" font sample come from a cover sleeve of an EP by french
    singer Etienne Daho in 1995. Artwork was done by Me Company (background picture
    credit go to Pierre & Gilles). Does Rian Hughes had any relation with Me Company
    at this period ? As you said Bald Condensed, the general feel makes you think
    of Miserichordia, well some other fonts he made give me that feeling too. '
