  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>, I&#39;ve been searching frantically for their logotype.  I
  understand it was made way back in the day before typefaces were used for jerseys,
  but I came across an <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6817.html#POST13126">old
  thread</a> that mentioned Dennis Ortiz-Lopez&#39;s <a href="http://ortiz-lopez.com/OLP06.html">Red
  Sox</a> font.  It&#39;s beautiful and exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but I can&#39;t
  find it anywhere except for that thread, and it&#39;s just making me want it more.  Do
  you guys have any info on this font or anything else really close to it?

  body: That typeface is remarkably similar to the bikie club Hells Angels&#39; font.
    I&#39;m creating a web page where I need to reference Hells Angels, and have been
    looking for their font. I&#39;ve found that they claim to have _trademarked_ the
    full font, not just the Hells Angels words. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.hells-angels.se/hjbcsaakjsdh.JPG"

  body: You should take extreme caution when dealing with the Angels... They appear
    to have sued people for the &#34;illegal&#34; use of their trademark &#40;eg on
    covers of books about them&#41;. And sueing people is the least innocent of their
    activities.

  body: This is good advice when dealing with baseball club logos too. MLB has taken
    great pains to copyright everything possible about team &#39;branding&#39;.  <BR>
    <BR>If you are marketing anything, I&#39;d think twice about it. &#40;goes for
    other pro franchises too&#41;.

    is a thread</a> from a Red Sox forum page  on the subject. Take it for what it&#39;s
    worth, but these are the REAL fanatics on the topic.

    the font is proprietary, for the Red Sox&#39; use only.

  body: Well, it sounds lik for your purposes the <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/voir.php?libelle=Dirty+Sox"
    target="_blank">&#39;Dirty Sox&#39; </a> font talked about in the Red Sox fan
    forum, should be OK. It would even give it more of a homespun feeling, since the
    font is not a very polished rendition of the Tuscan-style type the Red Sox use.
