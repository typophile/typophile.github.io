  body: What is it that you like about Fenice? There are many Didone fonts with small
    caps, which you probably know already, but I'm curious what about Fenice do you
    like maybe there is something more similar than simply a Didone.

  body: "Unfortunately Fenice is the corporate font of the client, I like it but I'm
    not deeply in love with it. The client has decided that small caps are the way
    to go and I'd like to prevent a crime against type, I can't tell you the client's
    name but they are a clothing company (no guesses I'm not allowed to answer:).\r\nTim"

    small caps? How is it to be used? Paragraph form?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fakedfenicecaps_4745.png]"

  body: Everything is a bit wide. New Caledonia or the Lanston Bodoni Bold might work.
    Storm's Walbaum is nice as well.

    body copy, initial \u2013 large cap rest of the word \u2013\_small cap. I investigated
    mixing weights which I can sometimes get away with with other fonts but the differences
    are too great.\r\nTim"
