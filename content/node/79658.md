  narrow, the fonts a given sample we provide may be from. And then there is, of course,
  www.identifont.com. Lastly, Harold Baldus at Phil's fonts often has been able to
  nail down fonts for me.\r\n\r\nBut has anyone put together, or even started to put
  together, something better and more comprehensive, in terms of a database, or query
  decision-maker (like identifont.com), or the millions of brilliant typographers
  and graphic artists on this forum?\r\n\r\nThis sounds like an area that getting
  together a bunch of folks like you and me, collaborating online, might be able to
  put together something that would help us distinguish between the Helveticas and
  the Arials, between the Times and Garamonds and Palatinos, etc.\r\n\r\nFrankly,
  we need more classifications of font, and font features, besides some image identification
  software that could really help.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I am trying to reinvent the
  wheel\u2014something which one of my college marketing professors emphasized NOT
  to do!\r\n\r\nGive me your knowledge, expertise, and wisdom on this ponderous pursuit
  of the typographers' (or typography finders') holy grail.\r\n\r\n"
