I thought this might be the place. Perhaps it was years ago.

I looked in earnest at your letters. I think the old grumpy people (with lots of time and experience behind them) may look at your "new and radical" with tempered eyes and see it as naive and flawed. There are some interesting qualities in some of the individual letters but there are also some "mishaps" in your forms. I would look to some other ancient forms to resolve some of the forms. I thought of three instantly when I was looking at your work. "Forms can be adapted across time."

I have found, when you challenge on this forum, members tend to take up the shield and sword. So approach it with dignity and humility instead of throwing a "hot bowl of soup" in their face.

Someone posted that recently all I did was was post a jpg and nothing else of my work, obviously they didn't even bother to scroll down through the thread to see the extensive 'brief' I posted there.  But it's cool. I can understand that a lot of you don't give a shit. Why should you? It's not like I'm some famous type designer or something.  I'm just asking, are there any real forums out there where people are really trying to help each other design type?  Cuz Typophile sure isnt one.

Nick, you and Hrant are like the 2 people that I didn't want to piss off, so, my bad.

Typerror, would love to continue this conversation viz email if you are willing.

We used an old dry-cleaning bag to cover the paper when it rained, stole pencils from the blind and scraped up dried squid guts for ink.

Typophile has its flaws, and its ups & down, just like anything else. And it's no substitute for going to conferences. And certainly no substitute for quiet observation and deep introspection. But it's still a very good place (and by far the best online place) to do what you're trying to do, and in my experience a superb place to start and build relationships. Not everybody can handle everything about it, and you should try to change it into something you prefer, but most of all just see how you can grow with it.

Re the conversation: Professional organizations are contemptible things. Breeding grounds for egos and back pats. But there's a lot to be learned if you look in the right places. And listen.

Re "a good place to discuss Retina displays": I started that thread because I had some legit questions re the impact of technology on type design and anticipated adjustments by foundries. The thread changed organically, eventually becoming a different discussion all together. Which was beautiful, I think.

And Ryan, I thought your attempt to be humorous was very funny. Got a kick out of it.</div>

So at least the paper you young guys used  practiced safe sex.

Us old timers didn't have paper yet, we used to write on the sidewalk with blood from our fingers. There were no condoms then either--not that it mattered, we were not allowed to have sex out of wedlock. The 50s were tough.</div>

Oh, those young farts stole that whole skit from us. Most people think the word "luxury" is used? It's not what you think. They are saying "lookshery", "look sure eeee"... "look Cherie", as in please check my time card, boss, to make sure I stamped it exactly one second before I'm leaving the "office", no matter how long ago i arrived at work.

"...tears...", "...urinate..." 

 One breath would destroy the 1/33" = 13.3333 light years scale of our paper drawings. You fellows didn't have to wear deep sea diving suits while you drew, did ya?</div>

Now post your type designs and we’ll consider them, grumpily or in whatever way we wish.</div>
