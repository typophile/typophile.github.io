  that demonstrate good use of combining both a serif and sans font. Preferably all
  within the one word, though examples of this in two or more words would be good
  to see.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nArran\r\n"

    certainly. Id be interested to know if anyone has seen this sort of typographic
    treatment done successfully/pleasantly within the one word though.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
    has others to throw into the mix then go ahead!..."
