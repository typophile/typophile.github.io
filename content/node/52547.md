  and am considering creating one page web sites for these listings as well.\r\nIf
  I set up properly, this shouldnt take more than if I set up my files properly. (I'd
  rather not get into how long it takes to do this)\r\n\r\nMy question is, what should
  I charge for this service?\r\n\r\nI hope I don't open a can of worms as I suspect
  there may be a discussion between charging per hour vs. per project. The value to
  the client is what's important.\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: 'In providing the Web page sources, you''re effectively providing a template,
    so over-pricing might result in the clients simply doing this themselves. If the
    creation of the pages is really little effort, so maybe charge a 20% to 25% premium
    for this value-add. '
