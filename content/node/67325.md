  body: "I think this may be a customization of a light weight of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/|Helvetica
    (Neue)]]. If you remove the 'a' stem and half of the t crossbar, and extend the
    arm of the r, then I think you are very close.\r\n\r\nThis may be doing it the
    hard way, but I was unable to find a more exact fit in a single font.\r\n\r\n-

    that they did exactly what you said, just thought with the gazillions of fonts
    out there, that it was an unmodified font (aside from the embellishment in the
    \"O\")\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nMike"

    in construction, but is based on a bold weight of Helvetica.'
