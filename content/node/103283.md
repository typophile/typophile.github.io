  body: "I suspected tiles.\r\nNice flowing monotone design, almost like an upright
    version of Kaufmann. It would make a good font if we had more of the characters.
    The top heavy numbers suggest the upper case would have a similar Deco flair\r\nI
    checked my old font books an drew a blank. Pre-WWII display ads were usually by
    hand creations rather than generated directly from fonts.\r\nIn the metal type
    era script fonts were rare because of damage issues. So If this was in fact a
    design from the era it was not a font, despite the letter-form consistency. This
    could be cleared up by a check of the Spanish foundry catalogs for the era. e.g.
    Bauer, which unfortunately I do not have.\r\nAnyway, I suspect that the poster
    version of the tiles advertisment may be a redesign. I note the reference to 2013.
    There are a fair number of font makers now making digital scripts. I don't recall
    seeing this one. Does anyone else recognize it?\r\nDon\r\n"

    thanks for your comments which I greatly appreciate! ...and maybe even someone
