  each car (in this case a 1963 Thunderbird), and the assembly line workers used them
  to identify which options to install as the car moved down the line. I've been unable
  to find it after hours of searching - any help would be much appreciated!\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROT_Sheet_5039.jpg]"

  body: It bears some similarities (although not many) with teletype print, but most
    likely it's a typeface developed specifically for "chain train" printers, and
    not something from a specimen book, and hence not likely to be a subject of revival...

  body: Thank you! "Restraining Order" is perfect for the numbers 5,6,7,8,9, and 0,
    and I already have "letters.ttf" which matches 1,2,3,4 and the alphabet very nicely.
    Five through zero was the big hangup, and you solved that one. Thanks again!
