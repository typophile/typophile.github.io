  be hosting is going to be a letterpress challenge. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if any
  of you had suggestions on relatively short, punchy quotes pertaining to letterpress,
  type, or printed material that I could ask the competitors to print?\r\n\r\nIf so,
  please include the source of the quote.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
