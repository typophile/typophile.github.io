    when Freehand was much easier and more fun to use than Illustrator, but I guess
    that predates Macromedia&#39;s acquisition of it by a while. 4.x was the last
    version I really liked.&#41; <BR> <BR>And both companies are a pain when it comes
    to the cycle of annual, painfully expensive product upgrades. At least Adobe writes
    reasonably speedy, usable software; maybe that will rub off on Macromedia. I wonder

  body: 'Regarding Fontographer: it is very unlikely indeed that Adobe&#39;s purchase
    of Macromedia will lead to a new version of Fontographer. It is much more likely
    that the produce will be retired completely, and will simply no longer be available.
    <BR> <BR>The history of Fontographer and FontLab has shown very clearly that for
    a large software company like Macromedia or Adobe a font tool is simply not worth
    development investment. The potential market is simply too small to interest them.
    Font tools need to be developed by small companies seeking a niche market, and
    FontLab has demonstrated that this approach can be very successful. <BR> <BR>I
    suggested some years ago that Macromedia should simply give the Fontographer code,
    including the aborted 5.0 version, to Jim Gallagher. He has spent a good portion
    of his life nursing this code and providing tech support to Fontographer users,
    so if there is any future to Fontographer it seems to me that he deserves to guide
    it and to benefit from it, if possible. Perhaps Adobe might consider this. They
    have been generously supportive of the makers of FontLab, DTL FontMaster, etc.,
    with their OpenType SDK code, so clearly encourage competition in the font tools
    business. Giving Fontographer to Jim for a dollar, and letting him do whatever
    he wants with it -- which might include open sourcing it, I suppose -- seems to
    me the best thing that could be done with this product. Otherwise, it might as
    well be withdrawn from the market, because it is never going to be updated by
    Adobe or any other large software company.'

    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s being optimistic. My guess is that SVG will just be dropped
    by Adobe altogether and yet another standard thrown out the window. ;o&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Adobe clearly bought Macromedia for Flash &#40;and maybe eHelp&#41;. Even
    Macromedia was falling behind with their apps. I love freehand, but the last two
    releases were feature bloated buggy POS releases. DW is getting along in years.
    FW never really blossomed fully &#40;great app, but still needed a lot of polish.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Just a hunch, but I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll jetison Freehand and Fireworks,
    keep Flash and maybe Dreamweaver, and sell of cold fusion. <BR> <BR>Definitely
    bad news for the graphic design industry, though.  <BR> <BR>In regards to apple,
    they are already competing with Adobe with things like Final Cut Pro. <BR> <BR>Coincidently,
    the other winner may be open source...with renewed interest/support in some of

    Poor fellow! He&#39;s spent years lobbying Macromedia without success, and now
    he has to start over with a new set of corporate goons. But as for Adobe _giving_
    away anything away? Je crois que non.  <BR> <BR>Otherwise I think it&#39;s very
    bad news. Competition is the only thing that makes products good. Apple has proved
    this again and again: how it is possible to do things that really do make it worthwhile
    to pay twice as much for a computer. For those who can afford it, it&#39;s a very
    nice situation. Photoshop has been in strong need of competition for years, and
    it is striking that nobody seems to be able to get in there and do it. Illustrator
    is now even more likely to stagflate, I fear, having taken its best recent ideas,
    now 8 or so years old, from LightningDraw GX. What a pity that Corel couldn&#39;t
    do a better job. Or Macromedia, for that matter.  <BR> <BR>I find it interesting
    that Quark 6.5 now has considerable Photoshop-like functionality, and this is
    only bound to increase. One can see clearly that the competition from InDesign
    has strongly benfitted Quark. Remember the dizzy days when Quark nearly took over

    beyond Premier for the Mac that  <BR>Adobe turned tail and ran&#41; they could
    potentially stop  <BR>developing the Flash plugin for Macs. &#40;Now that would
    suck for  <BR>Mac and would inevitably weaken Flash.&#41; <BR> <BR>______ <BR>
    <BR>But I&#39;m an optimist. I don&#39;t live in fear of Microsoft taking away  <BR>Office
    from the Mac and I won&#39;t live in fear of losing great  <BR>Macromedia apps.
    <BR> <BR>The real question, beyond this fun speculation is, will Adobe  <BR>really
    understand the power under the Flash hood &#40;talking about  <BR>ActionScript
    here&#41;. Flash is not just a designers toy any more. If  <BR>they let the Macromedia
    Flash team continue moving it forward  <BR>it will continue to compete head-on
    with Ajax as a rich internet  <BR>application platform, accessible to everyone.  <BR>
    <BR>Will Adobe understand that Flash for Mobile has some seriously  <BR>great
    potential as a tool that many designers/developers already <BR>know how to use?
    &#40;It&#39;s just a matter of convincing carriers  <BR>to use it.&#41; <BR> <BR>I

    the de facto video player for the web? While they weren&#39;t looking Macromedia
    snuck in an took it with the flash player. Macromedia didn&#39;t even begin to
    exploit the power they had over the media market. I really doubt if Adobe cares
    much about Macromedia&#39;s apps. They want to control the platform that now defines
    media on the web, and if it works out like they think, will define mobile space
    as well. In this way Adobe really will compete with Microsoft.

    <BR>Absolutely no argument there, Joe. I completely agree, as a technology, is
    has all sorts of uses. <BR> <BR>BUT...and a big but...the reality is that it&#39;s
    never taken off beyond a bell-and-whistle thing for 99% of the web. Much to MM&#39;s
    dismay, I&#39;m sure. <BR> <BR>The business pundits are saying this merger is
    mainly about Flash, but few pundits have really pointed out that Flash really
    isn&#39;t all it was originally supposed to be. Remember when Adobe had grand
    illustions that the entire internet would be PDF based someday? I think they realized
    that &#40;thankfully&#41; never happened and are now latching on to Flash hoping
    for the same...though they&#39;re a few years to late. <BR> <BR>&#34;On mobile
    devices it has the potential to become <BR>the UI for a mobile OS, not merely
    so you can &#39;make stuff move&#39;.&#34; <BR> <BR>Well, again, you are absolutely
    right. But the reality is that Flash was exactly that for the desktop world, yet
    it never became so. <BR> <BR>And, again, I think the mobile industry is becoming
    increatingly gloated with a perception that people actually want all of this.
    Some do, of course, but the &#39;mobile&#39; web has been around for years and
    still isn&#39;t the huge thing everyone had hoped it&#39;d be. <BR> <BR>&#34;And
    you can keep just making phone calls. Ten years ago people <BR>said, &#39;why
    would I want to carry a phone around with me?&#39;&#34; <BR> <BR>With each phone
    upgrade over the past decade, making a simple phone call has become increasingly
    more difficult. Handheld interface design is perhaps the best example of crappy
    interface design out there today. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>As for Avalon, it&#39;s a feature
    for feature&#39;s sake. MS has the money to market anything without any worries.
    If it sticks...Great. If not, well, at least they made the competition chase and
    waste money on a silly non-feature ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;They want to control
    the platform that now defines media on the web, and if it works out like they
    think&#34; <BR> <BR>I agree. Their mistake is thinking that that is, in fact,
    Flash. <BR> <BR>Again, I&#39;m not bashing Flash...I used it like anyone in the
    heydays of the web and still find it very useful for certain design, but it just
    never took off as that thin-client that everyone had hoped for, and, in the interim,
    DHTML &#40;namely with Ajax&#41; has seemed to be embraced in record time.'

    thing.  It allows you to make up your mind about someone based on such logical
    things as clothing, race, religion, perhaps even shoe size.  You don&#39;t even
    have to know the person.  You don&#39;t even have to use your brain--perhaps this
    is a good thing because biggots are most likely missing that bit of equipment.

  body: My experience of Adobe people is that very few of them wear suits. For example
    Tom tends to wear all black &#40;perhaps a nod to Steve Jobs&#41;, and David can
    often be seen in stylish Southwestern garb.     <BR> <BR>Si

    I just did it to prove to my colleagues that backwards  <BR>bigotry is bigotry
    all the same. I think I would&#39;ve gotten less comments  <BR>if I&#39;d gone
    to work bare-assed. What&#39;s with the suit fixation? <BR> <BR>On the other hands,
    everybody knows that &#34;suits&#34; as used in this  <BR>discussion is just a
    metaphor, so don&#39;t you all get on your high horse  <BR>over that.

  body: Jerks-wearing-suits is Gruber&#39;s term, not mine. And of course, there&#39;s
    a huge difference between those and nice-guys-wearing-suits. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    sure most of the folks at Adobe &#40;like our esteemed friend Mr. Phinney-wearing-jeans&#41;
    are good people, passionate about the software they produce. Gruber&#39;s complaint
    is that Adobe&#39;s CEO has very different priorities; he&#39;d rather improve
    Adobe&#39;s standing in the jerks-in-suits market than in the creative market
    &#40;since the creative market&#39;s $2 billion per year isn&#39;t enough for
    Adobe any more&#41;. The Macromedia acquisition is part of that strategy.

  body: I wear a suit when the occasion warrants it. =&#41; <BR> <BR>I think the the
    Daring Diatribe raises some interesting points  <BR>about the leadership of companies,
    but doesn&#39;t account for the  <BR>people on the ground who are doing the work,
    who are still the  <BR>same creative/smart/talented people. Whether the leadership
    of  <BR>the company is able to inspire and hold on to the talent is yet to  <BR>be
    seen, and that is the point I think he raises well.  <BR> <BR>Clearly Microsoft,
    the company everybody loves to hate, has  <BR>proven it can inspire and hang on
    to good talent. <BR> <BR>In the end, is the company innovating or resting on it&#39;s
    market  <BR>share? You can argue up and down about how all of these  <BR>companies
    &#40;Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, etc.&#41; are both seen to be  <BR>innovating and
    resting on past accomplishments in one area <BR>or another.
