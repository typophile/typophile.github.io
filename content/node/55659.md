  see the attached image, is called?\r\nIts a page from a pamphlet, we're about to
  make a second one and we don't have any info other than the said previous pamphlet.\r\nI
  know what it is, and its on the tip of my tongue but I just can't get it out. \r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nOh and by the way the language
  is Danish, just in case anybody was wondering."
