  body: "FWIW, I have searched every MyFonts category that should apply to this, and
    couldn't find the font. That suggests obscure foundry, or perhaps a customized
    font. I wondered, for example, if this might have been created from a sans serif
    by adding wedges?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    faith in MyFonts' categories, Mike!\r\n\r\nI think Modesto is your best bet. Also
    have a look at <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com\">Letterhead Fonts</a>.
    This is also a very common sign painter's style, so it's possible a lettering
    artist made the letters specifically for this project. What is the source?"

    and that was why I said \"FWIW\", but in my opinion MyFonts does the best job
    I have seen with keywords, making it one of the easiest to search, and their site
    has the widest and most varied collection compared to other major font resellers.
    \"Modesto\" was there and was similar, but as noted had numerous differences too.\r\n\r\nIf
    you found this one at another site I'd like to know about it, but unless I have
    a more specific idea of where to look, that's my first choice for someplace else
    to look.\r\n\r\nI think your custom idea is a good possibility, though, Stephen.\r\n\r\n-
