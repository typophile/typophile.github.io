body: "My partner and I took a freelance job a few months ago and the project is basically
  done. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the clients keep asking for more little things here
  and there and frankly the tone is starting to get a little bit abusive. Things like
  constantly calling us at home and during work after we've repeatedly asked just
  to be emailed, telling us their deadlines (often give to us short notice) are more
  important than our real job etc etc.\r\n\r\nThe \"edits\" are starting to get a
  bit outlandish as well. Things like programing a spell checker into their back end
  mailing list. (when the the simple answer would just be for them to update their
  ancient versions of IE)\r\n\r\nHow do I politely tell them we'd like the rest of
  our money and to finish off the project? The contract never stipulated how many
  revisions were to be made (learned my lesson) but this project has gone at least
  a month over schedule.\r\n\r\nFrankly I don't take abuse very well and I'd really
  like to finish this on an as polite note as possible. You know reputation and karma
  and all that."

  body: "I'm assuming with a 'new' client you obtained half the budget up front before
    undertaking any work?\r\n\r\nStart by trying to see the problem from their perspective.
    Many designers talk about reaching a good rapport with a client as a way of doing
    good work. This works both ways, they need to believe you are on their side and
    interested in what they are doing and are'nt just trying, rightly or wrongly,
    to make a quick buck.\r\n\r\nIf and when problems start on a job, I try and meet
    the client face to face as soon as possible. By nature people tend to take a more
    even handed tone in these situations, then when firing off emails. Its up to you,
    once in this sitution, to put your case for extra on the budget etc whilst discussing
    the merits of the job.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like money and deadlines to get
    a client thinking straight.\r\nIts all a game of cat and mouse really.\r\n"

  body: "Was a spell checker on the mailing list part of the original project? When
    new things are suggested that were not part of the original agreement, you respond
    with a cheery \"Sure, we can do that. It will only cost $xxxx\" (or better yet,
    change the second sentence to \"Would you like me to get a price for that.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    will find that a lot of essential, important, can't-live-without-it changes become
    unnecessary when there is a price tag attached to them."

  body: And - get caller ID. I had a client who refused to email, only called me,
    and I just stopped picking up the phone. He'd leave long messages and do the work
    and email him. He never got the hint, but I didn't have to talk to him.

    this.\r\n\r\nYou say \"We've finished the project as outlined in the proposal.
    Please pay the attached invoice. As for the additional changes requested, we will
    prepare a separate proposal and get that to you ASAP.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, get used
    to using the term 'change order' ;o)"
