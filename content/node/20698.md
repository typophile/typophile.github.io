body: "Why is arial still so highly used over helvetica? \r\nTake for instance my
  sister's highschool year book. Her instructor used arial for cutlines. Why would
  someone teaching design to highschool students use arial when they have pretty much
  any other choice? and especially over helvetica?\r\n\r\nI get that microsoft used
  arial in windows so it's widespread, that it is cheaper and that most people won't
  know the difference. But a design instructor? Also why do most people specify arial
  as the default font for websites over helvetica. Or even put arial before fonts
  like maybe verdana or trebuchet?"

    to Helvetica. As for the design teacher he must be a moron.

    \ He probably teaches English or something and just was volunteered to try to

    on screen it really doesn't matter and looks close enough to helvetica in weight

    that the teacher listed all these design aspects of the book on like the third
    page and the whole book looks horrid. For fonts its listed as:\r\nHeadlines: 60

    30pt Times New Roman, Italic\r\nCopy: 10pt Times New Roman\r\nCutlines: 8pt Arial\r\n\r\nlol.
    I don't understand why they had to use times new roman either, sure it's good
    for news print but there are plenty of other options that would have been more
    interesting. Bah."

    it or not, most browser out there use Windows and Internet Explorer, which means
    they have Arial installed on their systems; Macs, on the other hand, come with
    Helvetica pre-installed. Since Arial and Helvetica are reasonably equivalent in
    their gross metrics, web designers can be reasonably confident that the pages
    they design will be rendered in more or less the same way, regardless of browser
    or platform, following the hierarchy of arial-helvetica-sans serif. If Arial is
    available, the browser uses Arial; if not, it uses Helvetica; if neither is available,
    it uses a generic sans.\r\n\r\nI agree that almost all browsers render Verdana
    and Georgia better than Arial (they were designed to, and succeed admirably) but,
    until Verdana and Georgia  ship with every computer OS and browser, its use can
    create problems for web designers because their gross metrics are very different
    from their Mac equivalents."

    it has been used in sign design. Many of these vinyl cutting shops have people
    who simply grab one of the first fonts they see in the menu: Arial. Their CorelDRAW
    font disc has lots of naturally condensed and compressed faces. But these folks
    just squish or stretch Arial Bold and Arial Black to fit any space.\r\n\r\nArial
    is ugly enough it its own natural state. It's stomach-churning when seeing it

    hate it/ will never use it/ tell their students not to. Is it personal preference,
    over use, or some other reason?\r\n\r\nI think there are three reasons:\r\n\r\n1.
    Helvetica is a poor text face for print, but is constantly mis-used this way.
    Its combination of circular rounds and tight spacing make it hard to read, especially
    if it is used in long measure on letter-sized paper. Screen Helvetica & Arial
    are really a different animal as hinting quite changes its forms. \r\n\r\n2. It
    can be an effective display face, but it is so over-used that most type-aware
    people are sick of seeing it. Admittedly some designers, including prominent ones,
    are still fans, regarding it as a completely 'neutral' face that they can turn
    to whatever use they want with their designs. \r\n\r\n3. Many designers feel there
    are better alternatives to it as a display face, if you want its general look.
    These include Univers, which appeared at about the same time, and Akzidenz Grotesque,
    which is based on the same historical model. \r\n\r\nJohn Hudson has said with
    some justice that Helvetica is like a fish that everyone says they don't like
    but in fact eat every day. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19366\">Here</a>
    is one of the many, many discussions of Helvetica on typophile. "

    used as it is if Microsoft hadn't bundled it in Windows, Office, and Internet
    Explorer? It's never had the chance to make a name for itself in the marketplace
    the way Helvetica did, so we will never know. Its history is the key to its popularity,
    whether people know it or not. Whether it's a good typeface or not (sure, it's
    functional, although many designers don't like it simply on aesthetic grounds)
    is almost beside the point."

  body: "Arial and Helvetica are similar in some basic ways; however, there are so
    many subtle differences just beyond the broad appearance. Anyone who messes around
    with type will spot those differences eventually. Once seen, those differences
    are highly noticeable. The fonts become as different as night and day.\r\n\r\nThere
    are certain characters in Arial I find pretty ugly, such as the lowercase \"a\"
    with its crooked looking aperture. I don't like the angled cut at the top of the
    stem on the lowercase \"t\". The angled stem on the capital \"R\" seems pretty
    odd. Typefaces like Vectora, Akzidenz Grotesk, Trade Gothic among others handle
    those design cues in a more attractive manner.\r\n\r\nI'm sick of seeing Helvetica,
    but agree it is still highly useful in combining with other more flashy type styles.
    Helvetica Neue Extended has some personality at least."
