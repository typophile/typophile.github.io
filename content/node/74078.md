    image you linked looks like a prototype of Trilby, and I can only assume the djrtype.com
    URL refers to the very same David Jonathan Ross, who designed both Manicotti and
    Trilby.\r\n\r\nSlightly off topic, but to clarify: does the term French Clarendon
    more accurately describe type like Manicotti and Playbill, or something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/audebaud|Audebaud]]?"

  body: "Thanks Aaron. I'm curious too about the classification. I'm actually looking
    for a display-ish typeface. Trilby is wonderful, but lacks the punch I'm looking
    for. Manicotti is overdone for my project. Will keep trawling.\r\n\r\n"

    know that he's played a lot with different variations on this theme, not just
    his two published results. I'll bet that sample you cited (while not prepped for
    retail) is probably close to a working font. Maybe you could work out a special
    arrangement for some limited use.  "

  body: "I thought I had buried that image! \r\n\r\nYes that is one of the early studies
    of what eventually became Trilby. The version I released was chilled out a lot,
    but there's something here (especially in the italic) that I hope I can come back
    to if I take another stab at a reversed stress face. I forget what the status
    of this font is, but as Kent said, feel free to get in touch if you are interested
    in it or any of my other work.\r\n\r\nHave you seen Novarese's Estro? Not sure
    what the digitizations are like, but I love it. Then there are more playful Cowboy-ish
    fonts like the recent <a href=\"http://www.hvdfonts.com/\">Cowboyslang</a>.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the term 'French Clarendon': Looking at the marketing copy, Audebaud appears to
    be a 'Clarendon that is French', while the faces that I took inspiration from
    were 19th-century wood types called 'French Clarendons'. I think these tended
    to be of British/American origin, reversed stress, bracketed, and usually condensed.
    There are some examples of <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/a_ah/rrk/antiqueclarendonmenu.php\">French
    Clarendons</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/a_ah/rrk/antiqueegyptianmenu.php\">French
    Antiques (without bracketing)</a> on the excellent Rob Roy Kelly Collection site.\r\n\r\nI'm
    no classification expert, and I wasn't trying to make a statement by calling Trilby
    and Manicotti 'French Clarendons'. It just happened to be the label for the sources
    that I used as a jumping off point for these projects. I've spoken with people
    who refer to the whole mess as 'Italian', though this makes me think specifically
    of the super-backwards, high-contrast <a href=\"http://woodtyper.com/wp/uploads/2009/09/caslon-italian.gif\">Caslon's
    Italian</a>, and related <a href=\"http://moderntypography.com/Typedesign/Classics/CaslonItalian/index.html\">revivals</a>/<a
    href=\"http://vllg.com/Village/Arbor#panel=poster\">reimaginings</a>. So I'm not
    sure if any of these are 'accurate' terms, but I guess they'll have to do in a
    pinch."
