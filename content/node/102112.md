  say the first alinea with the sixth, you see they have different fonts.\r\nAny ideas
  ?\r\nDoes there exist any software for that ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nThomas."

  body: "This was one of the most impressive Metafont samples I ever saw; every single
    character was slightly modified, and a paragraph that started out a serif slowly
    became a sans. It does require lots of TeX knowledge (and inside that, the special
    field of Metafont).\r\n\r\nMultiple Master fonts can do this with ease -- if you
    can find one, and if you can find (modern) software that can use it!"

  body: If you have two or more compatible (multiple) masters, you can interpolate
    intermediate steps. You might not need a lot of variants to create a smooth transition,
    say,  from a sans to a serif. The biggest challenge probably is designing compatible
    sans and serif masters.

    thing you should leverage {edit: if you're dealing with only two actual fonts,
    as opposed to a \"morphing\" range as described below} is letter frequencies.
    For example \"e\" being the most frequent letter should probably be the last to

  body: Hi Thomas, I'm making exactly the same kind of stuff for my diploma project
    in typographic design in Paris. I'm using the blend option of FontLab to create
    a "mix" between two typefaces. If you repeat the operation many times (like a
    morphing in Illustrator) you can have like 3 or 5 steps between your two first
    fonts. I already made some test and it's quite working well.

    transition from one weight to another is almost imperceptible, e.g. Shinntype\u2019s
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/\">Sense</a> (eight weights).\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    while still on a weight axis, you could juice the effect by adding a minute stroke
    value in InDesign.\r\n\r\nYou can use the horizontal scaling and slant controls
    in layout apps similarly, to vary the axes of \u201Ccondensed/extended\u201D and
    \u201Citalicization\u201D incrementally.\r\n\r\nThese axes\u2014weight, horizontal
    scale and slant\u2014accommodate smooth incremental transitions, but morphing
    from serif to sans is a dodgier proposition that only a true metafont can accomplish.

  body: "<blockquote>\"Multiple Master fonts can do this with ease...\"\r\nReally?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nActually,
    since the MM technology has been phased out of Adobe's <em>own</em> software around
    a decade ago, not so easy ... <em>anymore</em>.\r\n\r\nPageMaker used to have
    a specific \"MM\" dialog, in which you could define any of the MM 'design axes'
    (the numerical parameters specifying weight, slant, width, and whatever the designer
    could think of). Nowadays, it's hard to even <em>find</em> a real MM font! Adobe's
    new \"Source Sans\" source file contain an MM source to generate the weights.
    Unfortunately it's a .vfb file (which is FontLab's internal binary format). I
    had to search hi and lo for a compiled .mmm format.\r\n\r\nThe only software on
    my system that can use the different design axes seems to be Illustrator. Other
    than in older versions, I cannot \"design\" a font in mine; I can only select
    one of the presets (which, I'm told, are pre-defined and saved inside the font
    file itself). Here is an image with the 6 presets:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mmdemo_5032.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    theory, you would create a font 'instance' for each of these 14 characters, divided
    equally over the supported axis range -- \"0WT\" for the first character, \"77WT\"
    for the second, etc. to end up at \"1000WT\" at the end; or any smaller value
    for smaller steps. That would make the characters vary only slightly from one
    to another. But ... alas, I cannot test this, as I don't seem to have the proper
    software to create custom instances.\r\n\r\nYou could probably create an MM font
    from scratch, and have your software interpolate from one font to another -- I
    don't know how much manual work that requires -- and then make as much \"pre-sets\"
    as you need."

    a fully functioning .MM font or some sort of transition possible. Is there?"

  body: What is the purpose of this gradual change? If it is to be as smooth as possible,
    first make weights equal (check in Photoshop). Use fonts with comparable x-height,
    ascender, decender. Make sure your intermediate steps are "acceptable", that they
    have e.g. serifs or not, but not "something in between", maybe make a semi serif.
    Use one step per line. I bet it should work with very few intermediates, maybe
    only 3. I want to see your results.
