  body: "One: the sample provided at the time the question was asked is Parka \u2013
    what it is next month or the previous is irrelevant. \r\n\r\nTwo: a sample was
    provided which tells me the reader has flash running.\r\n\r\nNow, what was the
    point of your posts? "

  body: "the point of my post was to inform everyone\r\nthat people who have disabled
    flash are unable\r\nto see what the font-of-the-month is, and that\r\nsome of
    us consider this absence of advertising\r\nto be a positive thing.  i hope my
    point is clear now.\r\n\r\nnow i note the presence of obtrusive flashing .gifs.\r\ni
    think there's a browser preference to squash those.\r\ni certainly hope so.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\np.s.
    \ i would say the point of the other post is to\r\ninform people who stumble upon
    this thread later\r\nthat the \"parka\" answer will probably be outdated.\r\nof
    course, you probably could have figured that out\r\nby yourself, if you had merely
    thought about it, right?\r\n\r\nright?\r\n"

    a smarmy git.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm pretty sure anyone with half a brain would realise,
    upon checking the sample, that the appropriately described \"Feature Face\" had
    long since changed, since it no longer matched the sample. Do you think you could
    have figured that out?d"
