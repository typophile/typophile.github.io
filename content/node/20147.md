  body: "When you have a moment, please take a look at the Loreto Bay website:\r\nhttp://www.loretobay.com/cms/index.html\r\n
    \r\nSee if you happen to know the names of the typefaces they are using:\r\n1.
    \ On the flash graphic for words that appear and disappear.\r\n2.  As the headlines
    and call-outs.\r\n \r\nI love the roundness of the letters (i.e., perfect circle
    \"o\"s, etc)  It is easy to ready quickly."

  body: "Having a tough time with this one... Seems Venetian with that \"e\". Do you
    have a better sample that than .gif? Is the dot of the \"i\" a circle, an oval,
    a diamond, or a square? Are the serifs traditional or slab? Tough to really see
    in that .gif...\r\n\r\nPerhaps <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horley-old-style/\"
