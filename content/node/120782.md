  the typeface used in the number on this car.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://fbcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-0/1969333_10152462547765678_1673707718715803104_n.jpg?oh=a3543149c111d92ccdc8b2a2efc6410b&oe=54EEACFF&__gda__=1421189056_72bc82fdeafcb0426c1d07a689f553c9\"/>\r\n\r\nAlso
  as I've been searching for this, I've realised that the best term to describe the
  font is \"inline\" but it seems the vast majority of inline typeface don't have
  the line continue out the ends of the character thus I'm wondering if there's a
  specific term for these kinds of typefaces.\r\n\r\nI noticed the 3 is one of the
  ways to define it by the sharp corner in the top. From my limited knowledge of type
  anatomy I'm not sure what you'd call it as most typefaces have it as rounded and
  then it'd be called a \"bowl\" but since it's sharp, I'm not sure what it's called.
  Is there a term for this kind of 3?"

    thus not necessarily being part of a proper typeface. \r\nThat said, you could
    maybe find something similar among the ones in Mike Yanega\u2019s extensive list
    of lined typefaces: http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html"

    from Dafont, for the event logo and thought they don't care that much about typography
    to have made their own font for car numbers.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link!"
