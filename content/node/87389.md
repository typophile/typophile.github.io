body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm looking into the convention of languages which
  set superscript letters in relation to number words (not sure if this the right
  word).\r\n\r\nFew examples below:\r\n\r\nENG\r\n1st, 2nd, 5th\r\n\r\nFR\r\n1er,
  2e\r\n\r\nNL\r\n2e\r\n\r\nCan someone refer to a complete list? There most be more.
  \r\nAlso, are their any opentype fonts, which have these as superscript glyphs?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for letting me know!"

  body: "In French the letters used to indicate the ordinal form of a number are usually
    made superscript. In English, they are not usually superscript. However Microsoft
    Word decided to set their word processor to automatically superscript the letters
    in ordinal numbers and so now ordinal numbers using superscript characters are
    more common on the web and perhaps even in printed text.\r\n\r\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator
    for information on ordinal indicators in a number of languages that use the Latin
    script.\r\n\r\nUnicode does not include all possible superscript characters for
    Latin, as the Unicode consortium considers superscripting (and subscripting) to
    be a style variant, like bolding and italicizing and underlining. Superscript
    characters are only included in Unicode when the character is to be distinguished
    from its full-size  counterpart in phonetic writing.\r\n\r\nOtherwise every character
    in Unicode would have to also appear in superscript and subscript form, and in
    a superscript of the superscript form and subscript of the superscript from, and
    in a subscript of the subscript form and a superscript of the subscript form,
    and so on, ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nFor a complete listing of pre-built superscript
    characters in Unicode see http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm?q=superscript&preview=entity
    and http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm?q=modifier&preview=entity
