body: Hallo,  <BR>I have to make some display signs and map &#40;&#39;you are here&#39;
  kind&#41; layouts for a school, and I&#39;d like to use Mrs Eaves &#40;white on
  black&#41; for main titles, plus something else &#40;grey on white&#41; for details.
  What do you suggest? Something not eye-catching and sans-serif yet sleek. <BR> <BR>thank
  you very much

  body: So I&#39;m confused do you want a sans or not? &#40;the wording was a bit
    ambiguous&#41; <BR> <BR>If you do want a sans, i&#39;d recommend Storm&#39;s <a
    href="http://www.stormtype.com/jsans.html" target="_blank">John Sans</a> as both
    <a href="http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=109" target="_blank">Mrs. Eaves</a> and
    John Sans are based on the Baskerville face.

  body: LOL, at BYU they used Mrs. Eaves for everything &#41;&#40;I think it musta
    been some type of &#34;official&#34; university face or sumfin&#41;. I don&#39;t
    see why you should discount signage! <BR>But seriously I agree with Kyle. A good,
    sturdy sans seems a more likely candidate for this type of thing than Mrs. Eaves.

  body: paul. actually byu&#39;s official typeface is ... i believe ... hoefler text.
    the design department however does tend to use mrs. eaves a lot. or they did when
    i was teaching there.

    is overused on that campus.

  body: I agree that Mrs Eaves shouldn&#39;t be used for &#34;way finding&#34;; but
    he said the signage was for &#34;you are here&#34;, not &#34;this way&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>If the wording of your final sentence, Massimo, meant that you wanted a sans-serif,
    I am enamoured with Slimbach&#39;s Myriad &#40;Bold or Semibold may be appropriate&#41;;
    but I am unsure how well a fit that makes with Mrs Eaves.

  body: Yes, Micah, that&#39;s exactly what I was thinking about. I thougt of Helvetica

  body: Metron is great, but I think Dyna Grotesk is better. I think it would work
    very well with Mrs. Eaves. John Sans is a great suggestion tho. Preface from Nick
    &#40;Shinntype&#41; could be more interesting tho, a little unexpected.
