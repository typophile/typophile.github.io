  this thread</a> slipped by so fast I didn&#39;t see it, and  <BR>now I noticed nobody
  mentioned my favourite unicase  <BR>designs. <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html"
  target="_blank"> Eidetic Neo</a>, in itself a beautiful and very forward- <BR>thinking
  serif face, has a great unicase weight <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PEidOm.html"
  target="_blank"> Omni</a>.  <BR> <BR>Also, both Emigre&#39;s <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PPlaR.html"
  target="_blank"> Platelet</a> and <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PDemR.html"
  target="_blank"> Democratica</a> have capitals  <BR>that are x-height sized, so
  they lend themselves perfectly to  <BR>unicase setting. <BR> <BR>And I know this
  is probably stretching it a bit thin, but  <BR>combining <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMrsR.html"
  target="_blank"> Mrs. Eaves</a> lowercase with the <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMrsP.html"
  target="_blank"> Petite Capitals</a> <BR>- smaller than the Small Caps and also
  x-height sized -  <BR>allows one to set unicase as well.
