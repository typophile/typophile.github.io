body: "I was approached by my soon to be published literary magazine at school to
  do an ambigram for the mast head. I figured I'd at least have a go at it...and decided
  that I would like to end up in a scripty/flowing style since the magazine is all
  about writing. I plan to put a sub head under it, clarifying the magazine ie. Drexel
  University Student Literary Magazine or just Student Literary Magazine. Just wanted
  to see what you all thought. I was quite excited about the construction of the M
  and the overall style...as was John Langdon. Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAYA.png]"

  body: "That's great, congratulations!\r\nFor a piece of lettering to be considered
    an ambigram, is it enough for it to <em>read</em> the same both \"ways\", or do
    the shapes have to be simmetric too?\r\n\r\nI keep thinking it would be interesting
    to do something which reads, ie, \"MAYA\" both ways, but where the shapes aren't
    necessarily simmetrical."

  body: "I think that you could use a little more space between the M and A as the
    join looks a little cramped. The ball terminal at the top of the M seems to conflict
    with the one below it, I wonder if you could do without one of them. You could
    also have a looser swash on the A,Y and make a more comfortable join between the
    verticals. Are you intending to use it in the middle of the front cover with the
    sub rotated?\r\nTim"

  body: David, this is very nice. The nice inky feeling in the M and the last A ...
    I wonder if the A and Y in the middle could have a tad more? For instance the
    crossbar in the A seems so thin, but also seems to have more opportunity in it.
