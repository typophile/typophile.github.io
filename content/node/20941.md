  drawing. (See attachment)\r\n\r\nDo you think a font with similar \"circles composed
  of straight segments\" design would be interesting?\r\n\r\nSo far I found Font Bureau's
  <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Armada\">Armada</a> (Light Condensed) but
  I'm not satisfied.\r\n\r\nYour suggestions are highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nP.S. Please
  pardon my poor english, I'm a french-speaking Typophile."

      It's a limited pressing sold only at shows so product placement in the store
      is not an issue. Font will used for artist name and all credits so readability
      is important.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    body: Thanks pattyfab! I know and this font collection (quite nice!) but to be
      honest I don't see the connection between the geometric drawing and any of the
      Chalet fonts. Can you tell me wich particular font you had in mind?

    and so on. Can you tell us more about what specific aspects you'd like the typeface
    to have?

      that would recall the drawing's circles that are actually made of straight lines.
      I'm sorry if I'm not being clear. It's a little frustrating not being so fluent
      in English!"

    because the pattern did look unconventional (read: non-classical.)\r\n\r\nHave
    you considered using a titling calligraphic serif face? I'll give you an example
    later. It's 105 degree outside and I nearly passed out from dehydration :)"

    Black Italic, which is what I see as a post-modern Egyptian (see the connection?)
    I personally like it because the outline has managed to stay neat and precise
    without sacrificing its handwritten and quirky qualities. It is, in my opinion,
    a great contrast to your pattern, both visually and conceptually."
