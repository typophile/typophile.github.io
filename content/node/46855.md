  for a good set of icons. I need generic ones about 20 pixels/square maximum from
  calendar icons to resources, users etc... could someone point me in the right direction?
  I need a large collection, one that can be used commercially.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMiriam"

    problem at that size. It looks like I find almost all I need in this collection.
    Some I will try and add myself copying your style if that is o.k.\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot,\r\nMiri"
