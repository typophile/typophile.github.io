  \"Journal for Plague Lovers\".  It doesn't necessarily have to have the backwards
  \"R\" in it.  (Manic-Street-Preachers-Journal-For-Plagu-465919.jpg)\r\n\r\nI believe
  this is also the same font I'm looking for:\r\n(n732549946_418940_2032.jpg)  Specifically
  the part where it says \"Welcome To\" and \"Completely Mad Collection Homemade Slot
  Machines\"."
