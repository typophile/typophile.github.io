body: Typesetting a certificate; should mimic calligraphy. Academic look. What font
  would you recommend? Do you know a style guide for indenting, aligning text? I see
  some certificates that use huge indents--is this the more formal style? Would love
  to know sources explaining what the "right" style for academic/diploma-type certificate
  is. Thanks.

  body: There are a lot of really nice calligraphic fonts, Chris, and what you choose
    all depends on what you are looking for, how much text you need to set, the size
    of your document, etcetera. If you want a truly calligraphic certificate, why
    not consider employing a calligrapher? <a href="http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=calligraphy&producttype=TYP">Veer</a>
    has a great selection of calligraphic fonts - why not start there? I don't know
    of any sources depicting the right layout of a certificate. I've designed a few
    myself and have always just been creative with the layouts.

    face, however, if you intend to get the names hand done it is very tricky for
    a calligrapher to mimic or complement a calligraphic typeface. For short amounts
    of copy it is usual to centre, can you give us an idea of the amount of copy you
    have to set?\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: "Thanks for your comments. I am setting about 19 lines of copy excluding
      headline. Style is landscape letter-size with 1-inch margins on all sides. So...it's
      a fair amount of text. It's a resolution from a trustees meeting--a certificate
      that recognizes the accomplishments of a prominent researcher. The type is currently
      centered, all caps, with para indents at about 5-inch. I've seen this style
      on other certificates hanging in our office but don't have any other precedent
      for what's appropriate.\r\n\r\nI checked Chicago Manual but wonder if there
      are other sources.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions? THANKS everyone!"

  body: "A few years back I set a certificate with a similar amount of copy I set
    it justified with the first line starting on the centre line with a large cap
    and the last line finishing on the centre line, it took a lot of fiddling to get
    it right but setting it centred would have been too much, unfortunately I no longer
    have a copy but I think I used Stempel Garamond and calligraphed (sorry about
    that word) the names.\r\n\r\nTim"
