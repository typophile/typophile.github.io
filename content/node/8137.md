body: 'So I was recently talking to my typographer friend Ike about what I believe
  to be some severe deficiencies in the way that OS X handles font rendering. Now,
  I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I&#39;m no typographer, but I do a lot of software
  and web development, using my powerbook, a windows computer, and linux. So, it seems
  to go without saying that I&#39;m not concerned with fonts in print or at large
  sizes, as much as I am with having clear, legible, type that&#39;s easy on the eyes
  and lets me get my work done. <BR> <BR>Now, that said, I should begin by noting
  that from a legibility standpoint, I&#39;ve yet to experience a font rendering system
  or set of default fonts that are better than those provided with Microsoft Windows.
  &#40;not ClearType, mind you, but the default non-antialiased &#40;at small sizes,
  anyway&#41; font rendering&#41;. Suffice to say I&#39;ve been happy with developing
  under Windows &#40;from a font perspective, at least&#41;  <BR> <BR>Mac OS X, however,
  is a different story all together. I&#39;ve noticed some serious deficiencies in
  the way that OSX renders fonts. I suppose that there are three things about it that
  really get under my skin: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Fonts render too light: Take for example
  the premier text editors on both the Mac and Windows platforms, BBEdit and EditPad
  Pro &#40;Because both of these pieces of software use the default system font rendering
  algorithms, we&#39;re not comparing the programs here, but the underlying operating
  system font rendering&#41;. The following two screenshots illustrate the default
  configurations of both BBEdit and EditPad Pro <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55756.jpg"
  alt=" BBEdit on Mac OS X&#44; Fonts too light.">  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55757.png"
  alt="EditPad Pro on Microsoft Windows&#44; Legible and easy on the eyes."> . Now,
  admittedly, the fonts in the OSX screenshot are antialiased, while they aren&#39;t
  in the Windows screenshot, but that aside, I find the windows fonts to be infinitely
  more legible and usable than those in OS X.  <BR> <BR>2&#41; Font kerning problems:
  This problem REALLY confuses me. Partly because of the lack of quality control on
  Apple&#39;s end, but also because I haven&#39;t heard people complain about this
  in the past. Take for example <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55758.jpg"
  alt="Horrible kerning issues under Mac OS X"> this screenshot. Taken in Safari,
  Courier New, 14pt &#40;blue and underlined because it&#39;s a link&#41;. Being a
  monospaced font, I would expect the space between the first square bracket and the
  &#39;t&#39; to be the same as the space between the &#39;p&#39; and the closing
  bracket. Also, the underline extends beyond the closing bracket, and there is no
  space between the underline and the text. <BR> <BR>So, are these &#34;bugs&#34;
  or are they &#34;features&#34;? What does everyone think about this? Are Mac OS
  X fonts pretty but unusable? Are they ugly? Are non-antialiased fonts better at
  screen resolutions &#40;72dpi&#41; for programming/scripting than anti-aliased ones?
  Is this a problem with the fonts themselves or the implementation of the renderer?'

  body: Try using Courier instead of Courier New as your default font in BBEdit. Courier
    New is much lighter than Courier and this results in it looking quite light in
    OSX text rendering.  <BR> <BR>You might also try using my free <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html"
    target="_blank">Anonymous</a> font. At 9 and 10 points it renders without anti-aliasing
    in BBEdit on OSX, and, since it is large for its size, 9 and 10 point are closer
    in size to 11 and 12 point Courier.

  body: 'Note also that BBEdit has an option in the preferences to turn of anti-aliasing
    at up to 12 point &#40;see the &#34;Editing: General&#34; panel in the BBEdit
    Preferences&#41;. I don&#39;t know if EditingPad Pro has a similar option, but
    you can also make this change system-wide in the Appearance panel of the System
    Preferences. <BR> <BR>For what it&#39;s worth, Courier is the default OSX monospaced
    font and comes from Apple. Courier New is an optional font which usually comes
    from Microsoft and was probably installed when you installed a Microsoft app for
    cross-platform document compatibility with Windows which doesn&#39;t have Courier
    &#40;without the &#34;New&#34;&#41;.'

  body: I&#39;m not going to argue that OS X does a nice job of font rendering, and
    you certainly point out some particularly weird things. But among those there
    are a couple of points that need clarification/correction. <BR> <BR>There are
    two definitions of &#34;kerning,&#34; neither of which is applicable here. Monospaced
    fonts generally don&#39;t have &#40;either kind of&#41; kerning, and certainly
    Courier doesn&#39;t, regardless of version. I&#39;m pretty sure what you mean
    is spacing, not kerning. <BR> <BR>&#34;and there is no space between the underline
    and the text.&#34; <BR> <BR>Generally, the underline is below the baseline, but
    above the descender line. That&#39;s the case here. Yes, it cuts across the descender
    on the &#34;p.&#34; Sad. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Mark- <BR>That Anonymous font of yours is quiet nice, easily the best I&#39;ve
    found so far for editing on osX <BR> <BR>Tom- <BR>Thanks for the corrections,
    like I said I&#39;m not type buff, so I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m off on a lot of
    my terms. This is still a definite problem though, is it not? What are the short
    term and long term solutions to this? Is Apple planning on revamping the font
    rendering system in osX? Is this a problem we can fix just by choosing better
    fonts to use system wide?

  body: No argument there, that the OS X rasterizer could improve. As I understand
    it, Apple has been making an ongoing effort to improve their font rendering -
    as in, it has already changed at least once within the OS X era - and I expect
    that to continue. <BR> <BR>Certainly choosing a font that works as well as possible
    with the current rendering tech will help, but if you really don&#39;t like the
    current rendering, you may be pretty limited in how much you can improve things
    through font selection. <BR> <BR>Of course, as noted elsewhere in this thread,
    you can also set the size at which anti-aliasing kicks in on OS X, which may help.
    <BR> <BR>I must admit that the advent of OS X made me particularly glad that Adobe&#39;s
    own applications generally use their own rendering system, independent of the
    OS. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Kyle, did you try using Courier instead of Courier New? Also, you can get
    very close to the way Courier New looks in Windows by setting the aliasing threshold
    in OSX to 12 point. <BR> <BR>&#40;I think BBEdit could do with an option to specify
    linespacing, but that&#39;s their problem not Apple&#39;s.&#41;

    Courier New. I wonder why this is? I still like Anonymous better, though.

  body: I believe that, first and foremost font rendering must make sure that it doesn&#39;t
    hurt the eyes of the reader. <BR> <BR>While OS-X gets better with each version,
    Windows XP completely fails here. I just had the &#34;pleasure&#34; yesterday,
    proof reading on a rather new Dell laptop running Windows XP &#40;yes latest update
    otherwise I wouldn&#39;t consider posting here&#41;. After a short while I got
    a feeling similar to being sea-sick and had to quit.  <BR> <BR>I just wonder why
    &#34;the big 3&#34; don&#39;t get together and develop a stunning rendering system
    all-together, hmm perhaps because one of them hates their users, oh well. <BR>

    got some MS subscription thing going&#41;. <BR> <BR>Next time I can get my hands

  body: Since I switched to Mac in August, one of the things I&#39;ve really missed
    is the way that Windows renders text.  I don&#39;t expect Postscript fonts to
    render super crisp on screen, but I do Truetype fonts, and to me, on OSX, all
    fonts look like they&#39;re Postscript by the way they render. <BR> <BR>Text on
    windows is just so much clearer, and with Cleartype enabled it&#39;s just so much
    more pleasing aesthetically.  Apple should licence the rendering tech MS uses
    for Windows because it is just far superior. <BR> <BR>And what&#39;s the deal
    with the different AA modes in OSX?  Maybe it&#39;s me but I can&#39;t see any
    difference in the way text looks with them.

  body: I tried the Power Toy today, I managed to get it a little better after that
    tweaking, not much. <BR> <BR>The font used for this was Lucida Unicode &#40;funny
    name, but yes&#41; and the &#39;reading mode&#39; in Word basically just gets
    the menu items out of the way so they don&#39;t disturb you while reading. I couldn&#39;t
    see any difference in rendering. The display is set to the recommended setting
    &#40;too many pixels on too small display&#41; the display must be RGB since the
    BGR setting in your Power Toy looked worse. Also I must say, I found it rather
    interesting that an external web document can make system level settings. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m just happy that this Dell is not MY machine and I only need to get
    my eyes hurt occasionally. <BR> <BR>Aesthetically pleasing? I don&#39;t know,
    the letter-forms just loose too much of their genuine shape.

    <BR>Agreed. <BR>&#40;BTW, Frank is way biased on this. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;
    If you&#39;re seeing rainbow fringes, ClearType could be configured incorrectly.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what &#34;rainbow&#34; means here, but it&#39;s pretty
    <i>&#34;clear&#34;</i> that color fringing is part of CT. <BR> <BR>&#62; ClearType
    itself has also been improved  <BR> <BR>Yes but there&#39;s still a -newly spawned-
