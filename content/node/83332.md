    logins?

  body: "Let's just say we've been getting more than our fair share of off-shore spammer
    and hacker traffic, who for some reason, love Typophile just a little too much
    lately. They're not brute-forcing forum logins, but they're pounding on the server
    non-stop. We're doing our best to keep it off your collective radar, but it's
    a battle we continue to fight every day.\r\n\r\nThe captcha on login was unintentional.
    You shouldn't be seeing that anymore, so let me know if its occurring for you.
    \r\n\r\nJust happy to be back online."
