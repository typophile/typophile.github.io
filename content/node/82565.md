  instantly thought it would be good for a graphic project I have. \r\n\r\nIt's edgy
  in the same way as Gridnik and Blender (which I identified thanks to this forum!),
  but it is still a bit different, maybe a bit more softer looking. \r\n\r\nAt least
  'E', 'A' and 'V' are different.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you can help :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tomarjovem1_5035.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tomarjovem2_4881.jpg]"
