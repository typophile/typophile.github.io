    <BR><a href="http://www.paratype.com/">Paratype</a> works with multilingual fonts
    &#40;mostly Cyrillic though&#41;. <BR>Some Emigre fonts do have Cyrillic and Greek
    versions, but they&#39;re sold separately, as far as I recall. <BR>Most of the
    MS fonts shipping with WinXP also cover CE, Cyrillic and Greek. <BR>And of course,
    Adobe fonts: Warnock, Adobe Garamond, etc.'

  body: Actually, Adobe Garamond Pro does not have Cyrillic. Adobe&#39;s upcoming
    Garamond Premier does, though. Besides Warnock, there&#39;s both Greek and Cyrillic
    support in Minion Pro and Myriad Pro. Most of our other typefaces currently in
    development will support both Greek and Cyrillic, too. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: Is there a reference anywhere for which of the OpenType character sets that
    support Greek also support polytonic Greek? [[Robert Bringhurst]] mentions Minion
    Pro and Lithos Pro as both having Greeks, but only Minion has a polytonic Greek.
    Right?

  body: A bold experiment in trying to get the Adobe online type previewer to spit
    out polytonic Greek has resulted in abject failure. Yet I maintain my plucky,
    empirical spirit!

    support.
