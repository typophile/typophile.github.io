  going to start drawing some glyphs, leading to my first type design. I'm still looking
  for a collaborator who is amenable to ...creative... ways to ultimately be compensated
  for doing the heavy lifting. But because I know exactly how that sounds, I may wind
  up going the whole way alone.\r\n\r\n<strong>What letters should I draw first?</strong>\r\n\r\nI
  want to establish the vertical proportions, so /H/x/l/p/ ...? I want to establish
  the stroke contrast and angle of stress. What would you do?\r\n\r\nWhat else do
  you wish you were told before you started your first typeface?"

    Why?\r\n\r\nWhat issues is the font supposed to address?\r\n\r\nIf it will be
    a text font start with the \"n\" and \"o\"; if it will be a display font start
    with things like the \"a\" and \"g\". This last one will play a big role in the
    vertical proportions. (I'm assuming you're making a Latin font.)\r\n\r\nWhat I
    wish I was told? About my own limits.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "My two cents: Try to find the letterforms that are repeated. In the font
    you are reading now, that would be groups like hmnu, pdbq, HI, LEF, AVW and so
    on. Add to that the most used letters and the letters that has the most unique
    shapes in your particular design.\r\n\r\nI wish I was told this: \r\nYou don\u2019t
    have to satisfy everyone with your design. Opinions are subjective, even among
    professionals. Listen to feedback (because this field is a lot bigger and more
    complex than you\u2019d ever imagine), but when push comes to shove just draw
    what you like or what you need*.\r\n\r\nI am not a professional type designer
    (yet), so perhaps what I suggest is BS. I have no idea. You judge!\r\n\r\n* Most
    of my ideas rise from frustration: I can\u2019t find any typeface that does what
    I want to do good enough. It might be about a vibe, or it might be some technical
    thing. \r\n\r\n"

  body: ":o) What Mr. Montalbalno said.\r\n\r\nAs they say, ( or as someone said),
    'a good font isn't a collection of beautiful letters. It is a beautiful collection
    of letters'. No letter is complete until you can see how works in words and have
    taken the time to fix any little thing that seems a bit 'off'. \r\n\r\nRegarding
    Hrant's comment, \"Why\": For your first font the only possible answer is, because
    you want try and  make a font.  \r\n"

    services of a fine type designer, and you've got a lot of time and patience.\r\n\r\nIt's
    like when they ask composers why they write music. The only true answer, as I
    see it, is \"because I have to.\"\r\n\r\nThanks, all, for the advice."

    Cabarga's Logo, Lettering and Font Bible, really the best teacher on the topic
