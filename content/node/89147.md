  (technical?) reasons not to include svg's?\r\nWith svg one just could zoom in so
  gorgeously!"

  body: "Works for me on the iPad, live zooming and all. \r\n\r\nMind you, SVG is
    not nearly as good supported as, say, PNG. Maybe you can remember the good old
    days when the latest Internet Explorer could not display most transparent PNGs
    (what was it, the version before the current one?). My iPad runs Safari, or something
    quite close to it, and has no problems with an SVG. Other browsers may need a
    plugin for this.\r\n\r\n[Edit].Ooh I just Googled for \"typography filetype:svg\"
    to find an appropriate image. Lots of interesting stuff, all in gorgeous scaling
    vector format.\r\nYou'd have to try if they work with uploading to Typophile's
    Upload Image function -- it seems it's a bit buggy lately."

    appear at all.

  body: "Same with IE8 on Windows 7 -- it shows the \"missing graphic\" graphic. That's
    without any additional plugins.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics\">Wikipedia
    on SVG</a>:\r\n\"Native support became partially available in Internet Explorer
    9 (the current version of IE, as of March 2011).\"\r\n[...]\r\n\"Internet Explorer,
    up to and including IE8, was the only major browser not to provide native SVG
    support.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to that same page, lost of other browsers are reported
    to 'partially' and 'incompletely' support SVG.\r\n\r\nI guess that's your answer."

  body: "How-to for other dummies like me:\r\n\r\n1. Save your SVG somewhere in the
    internet (e.g. http://www.w3.org/Icons/SVG/svg-logo-h.svg)\r\n2. Use the url in
    the following html tag:\r\n<code>\r\n&#60;img src=\"http://www.w3.org/Icons/SVG/svg-logo-h.svg\"
    &#47;&#62;\r\n</code>\r\n3. You can put this code snippet anywhere in your comment.
    You will get\r\n<img src=\"http://www.w3.org/Icons/SVG/svg-logo-h.svg\" />\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much Theunis!\r\n\r\nI would find it cool, if svg pictures were also
    allowed under the \"Insert image\" button."
