body: I&#39;m working on an exhibit project and I was hoping for input on typefaces
  that hold up well in large size &#40;36pt&#43;&#41; paragraph settings.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  curious if there are any typefaces designed specifically for this type of application.

  body: Is the large size due to the type being viewed from a distance? If that&#39;s
    the case you should treat the problem as a &#34;normal&#34; text setting issue
    &#40;and factoring in the distance to get the ideal point size&#41;. Otherwise
    I guess you&#39;re doing it for effect, since very large type can&#39;t really
    be read effectively &#40;at normal reading distances&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp
