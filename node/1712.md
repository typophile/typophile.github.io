  body: The book from FontShop International, called &#34;The Font Book&#34; is the
    best such book on the market right now. It&#39;s expensive &#40;$110 US was what
    I paid for a new copy&#41;, but it&#39;s hard to find one book that shows as many
    fonts that is as easy to use. If that&#39;s too steep, consider getting the Catalogs
    from those two foundries, if that&#39;s where your main interest lies. Frankly
    if you are iterested in only a couple of foundries, their web sites are just as
    good for seeing what they have &#40;and it&#39;s always up to date&#41;. I would
    also suggest including Agfa-Monotype &#40;<a href="http://fonts.com" target="_blank">http://fonts.com</a>&#41;,
    since they have been including many other foundries in their collections, and
    are becoming one of the more comprehensive sources of fonts. Bitstream&#39;s MyFonts.com
    is another great font resource online, and would show Adobe, Linotype and many
    other foundries. What Agfa &amp; MyFonts don&#39;t cover Phil&#39;s Fonts &#40;<a
    href="http://www.philsfonts.com" target="_blank">http://www.philsfonts.com</a>&#41;
    often includes, so those three are good resources.

    Guide</a> is also a decent tome, although it hasn&#39;t been updated in 5 or 6
    years.

    these days. You mean to say you don&#39;t like it, Stephen?

    a visual contradiction.

    useful that you couldn&#39;t get for free.  <BR>Plus, it&#39;s only one of a five
    weight family, so maybe  <BR>someone would like it enough to buy other weights.
    <BR> <BR>I got lucky with the name Coquette, which turned out to be  <BR>much
    better than the name I wanted to use: Ruby Script.  <BR>When I did the usual research
    to make sure the name  <BR>wasn&#39;t already in use, I found out that there was
    a scripting  <BR>language by that name. It would have been a mess on  <BR>Google.'

  body: <i>It&#39;s surprisingly rare.</i> <BR> <BR>Really? I&#39;m under the impression
    that most type designers  <BR>agonize over naming their fonts. I mean, you spend
    all that  <BR>time on the font itself, you want to be just as careful with  <BR>the
    name. I think the name can be just as important as the  <BR>design and it&#39;s
    not easy to come up with a good one. I  <BR>almost never use the one I start out
    with. And I&#39;m not  <BR>always happy with what I end up with, especially some
    of  <BR>my earlier ones.

    Mark. There&#39;s a  <BR><a href="http://fonts.ontheweb.com/fonts/ruby-script__1.html"

  body: Actually, that was the other reason. I thought I might get by  <BR>with it
    since <a href="http://www.weatherlysystems.com/">the font was no longer being
    sold and it appeared <br>that WSI was out of the type business</a>. But when I
    saw it was  <BR>also the name of a scripting language, that clinched it. <BR>Since
    it appears that it&#39;s still being sold by somebody, it&#39;s <BR>a good thing
    I dropped it.
