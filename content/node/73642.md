body: "I realize \"typography workshop\" is very vague, which is why I'm looking for
  input from others who have attended or even assembled workshops for events like
  TypeCon, et al. \r\n\r\nI'm on the board of directors for our local chapter of AIGA
  in Nebraska (USA). I'd like to consider hosting a one-day or two-day workshop that
  would allow our local design community to dive deeper into typography-related learning
  than what is available at most 4-year schools. Obviously I'm not looking to make
  them experts in 7 hours, but I would at least like to let them get their hands dirty
  doing something they wouldn't normally do.\r\n\r\nThe key thing to keep in mind
  is that our community likes to be able to walk away with something tangible as a
  measuring stick of what they learned. We have less success with the abstract design
  lecturers (Ellen Lupton), and better success with speakers who offer something tangible
  (Jim Sherraden from Hatch Show Print brought his woodblocks for a printing workshop).\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any success stories to share, or ideas for topics that would be great
  for advanced non-type-designers? Modular typeface development? Lettering? Is anyone
  familiar with this: http://www.thetypestudio.com/workshops.html\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    She has held a number of \"Gourmet Typography\" workshops around the country and
    they always get a great response. The TDC has offered her workshop many times
    in NYC, with much success. I believe several AIGA chapters have hosted her workshops
    as well.\r\n\r\nI know she also does customized typography workshops for corporations
    as well."

  body: "Thanks terminal for confirming that Ilene is a great presenter!\r\n\r\nSii,
    the class size would be no more than 40; realistically in the 20-ish range. The
    more people, the more chance we have of breaking even on paying for event costs,
    but my first and foremost goal is to just make it a great workshop."

  body: 20+ people is a lot for a hand-on typography workshop. If you plan on having
    multiple presenters it might make sense to rotate smaller groups people through
    the workshops.

  body: "What I found quite rewarding \u2013 and truely tangible \u2013 when I held
    one-week seminars to undergraduate students was this: everyone to bring a dozen
    of potatos and a sharp knife. I provided simple A-Z sample sheets of some good
    typefaces. And the students were to cut these letters into the potato halfs and
    then stamped some posters with it. They enjoyed it very much and I think, one
    learns a good deal about type shaping from it.\r\nThough this more a beginner\u2019s
    exercise, naturally."
