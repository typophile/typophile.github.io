  I built what is best described as an \"extreme\" OpenType/CFF font that is useful

  font resource editing software.\r\n\r\nI upped the proverbial ante this past week
  by adding a third axis of extremeness to this font, and blogged about it (and also
  make it available for download). See: [[http://blogs.adobe.com/CCJKType/2012/01/extreme-otf.html|CJK

  body: "Ken, this is excellent! As a matter of fact, it made my own home grown OTF
    checker crash (and in the middle of charstring #167 at that -- I need to check
    for integer overflows, methinks), so it is indeed a good stress test.\r\n\r\nAre
    you aware of a similar font on which I could do tests for a CFF charstring parser?"

    dropped it into the OS (Mac OS X), and it is serving as a fallback font.\r\n\r\nAbout
    your request, I would need to know more about what limits you're looking to test.
    Charstring length?"

    Charstring length?</cite>\r\n\r\nUh, no (that maxes out at 64K - 1, IIRC). It
    wasn't a really well thought out question: after some more studying I don't think
    there is any requirement at all to be able to 'test charstrings'.\r\nEither a
    charstring is syntactically correct (i.e. leading to a valid stream of numbers
    and operators, where each operator clears the stack as per Spec.5177, and does
    not exceed the implementation limits in there), or it may be considered \"malformed\",
    and then there is probably something wrong with the charstring generator that
    was used.\r\n\r\nA charstring generator is what I'm attempting to code; and indeed,
    encoding of outlines is straightforward (all just syntax) but problems in the
    \"semantics\" of outlines are much harder to detect, avoid, and/or automatically
    solve: overlapping shapes (I don't think there is an actual <em>rule</em> against
    this, but I gather it's \"seriously frowned upon\"), renegade curves (where 3
    or more curve data points are 0), and artefacts cause by rounding from floating
    point coordinates to the 1,000 Unit Fixed Square.\r\n\r\nA fun project, nevertheless."

  body: "Let me expand a bit on that for interested lurkers.\r\n\r\nThe byte stream\r\n<code>00
    00 01 80 00 0A</code>\r\n\r\nis <em>invalid</em> because <code>00</code> does
    not produce valid code. This one is better:\r\n<code>FF 00 01 80 00 0A</code>\r\n\r\nbecause
    the first 5 bytes translate in a floating point number: 1.5. The sixth byte translates
    into the opcode \"callsubr\", so this sequence correctly translates into\r\n<code>1.5
    callsubr</code>\r\n\r\n... but a subr number must be an integer (it is a simple
    table based lookup). So this is still \"wrong\", but on a higher level. But even
    when we change this code into\r\n<code>F6 0A</code>\r\n\r\nwhich translates into\r\n<code>-1
    callsubr</code>\r\n\r\nwe cannot be sure if this is \"correct\". According to
    Adobe's Charstring Specification #5177, there is a limit of 10 nested callsubr
    calls, and there is no way we can check if this one is the eleventh without actually
    parsing the entire charstring.\r\n\r\nStill, these checks can be done by a fairly
    basic program. More insidious are syntactically correct constructs such as\r\n<code>10
    0 10 vlineto</code>\r\n\r\nor indeed\r\n<code>10 0 -10 vlineto</code>\r\n\r\n(I'm
    <em>certain</em> that's not allowed), or self-crossing:\r\n<code>2 1 -1 -2 hlineto</code>\r\n\r\n...
    which is where the fun starts for me :)"
