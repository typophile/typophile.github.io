  body: Laura Worthington's <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/number-five/'
    target='_blank'>Number Five Smooth</a> , manually slanted, would be quite close
    - except the C.  There's an alternate b without the connector - like yours. That
    C may be a modification or borrowed from some sport script.

  body: "Good digging Mike! If one wanted to make something like the sample this would
    work as a starting point. The letter-forms, weight, and contrast are definitely
    in the ballpark. About another  five degrees of slope and some editing of details,
    and Number Five is pretty close. In any case I appreciate Laura Worthington as
    one of our more accomplished script font makers.\r\nDidn't get any further info
    from the ID requestor, so we really have very little to go on to determine if
    this is a script as such, or a custom word .\r\nI am still interested in this
    project because the letters suggest something that would be [or is] an engaging
    script.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks for the source info. I did some checking on-line, and observed that
    this is perhaps the new version of Roundtree & Yorke's _Caribbean_ trademark.
    At least it's shown on labels of Roundtree & Yorke's _Caribbean_ items now being
    sold by major retailers. I was not able to find information on the date of trademark
    registration, but I did find labels on what may have been earlier stock of Roundtree
    & Yorke's _Caribbean_ label with the word _Caribbean_ in a Roman text.\r\nOn balance,
    I'm going to guess that Roundtree & Yorke's _Caribbean_ trademark as shown in
    the image, is the fairly recent work of a designer who may or may not have adapted
    Laura Worthington's Number Five Smooth, published in February 2013 or earlier.
    \r\nOf course, the designer might have adapted another baseball style script.\r\nDon\r\n"
