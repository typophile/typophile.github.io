  been late 60's)?  I believe this one was originally scanned in (and is starting
  to look quite grainy by this point).  It looks much better on the old stationery.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oakledge_logo_small_brightg2

  body: If you are confident in your Illustrator/lettering/design skills, you might
    try redrawing it yourself in AI. If you are less confident about doing it yourself,
    you might hire someone else to do this task for you. For logos in particular,
    I find that a lettering option is typically better than a font option, particularly
    in cases like these.

  body: Good catch on the 'e's.  I didn't even notice that.  Very helpful feedback!  Thank
    you both so much. I'll see what I can manage...
