    answer the question of whether it\u2019s suitable for body copy, have a read of
    what the folks at H&FJ have to say <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/features.html\">here</a>. "

  body: Gotham is a very open typeface. Large, open counters and as well as large
    x-height in relation to the ascender and descender render it usable at text sizes.
    That said, however, too much of it at a too small point size, especially on a
    coated bright white paper, could send the reader into fits. It sparkles.

    Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\nIf Gotham bold were the headline, what would make nice
    body copy? "
