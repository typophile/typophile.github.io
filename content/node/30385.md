    characteristics of Magneto just altered (and poorly) the J is simplistic enough
    that it could have been hand crafted. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6cc76e0f632fb56afe8e4a816e2b901e_6065.gif]"

  body: "I checked all the 'chrome-style' connected scripts I know and I came back
    to the idea that it has to be a brutal modification of Magneto. Look at the <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/magneto/superboldextended/\">Superbold
    Extended version</a> and consider it a starting point for a rather grotesque distortion.
    The J is a new drawn letter,and the others are so mutilated that they might as
    well be.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Magneto in Illustrator. The J's aren't even close. Of course, the J could have
    been substituted, but I also noticed a difference in the e's as well. They too,
    could have just been altered along with the y.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to make sure.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type
