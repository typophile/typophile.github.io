  body: The lowercase of Park Place is Caslon 540 Italic, both  <BR>capital Ps are
    an as of yet unidentified English Script. <BR>The Lexus logo is custom designed
    of course, tho you  <BR>might find similar stuff.

    found for the &#34;P&#34; is Script 33, but the Caslon 540 italic is right on.'

    href="http://www.lexus.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lexus.com/</a> <BR> <BR>I
    thought Avenir but the x-height is wrong, as are some characters. It&#39;s very
    nice.

    Rich Roat from House gave a presentation here in Phoenix, I learned that it&#39;s
    pronounced &#34;noy-trah,&#34; not &#34;new-trah&#34; as I had previously believed.
    And, yes, I can hear all of you German/Dutch speakers laughing.&#41; <BR> '

  body: Not to sound picky, but it&#39;s not quite Neutraface either. Look at the
    cap A and the numbers. It&#39;s not as quirky. And I do love Neutraface however
    you pronounce it.

    <BR>The Lexus website face indeed is the deliciously highbrow Neutraface.

  body: Hmm, you may be right, Patricia. My other suggestion would be one of the Nobels,
    perhaps a version from Font Bureau or Dutch Type Library.

  body: Yep, I think you called it. I really gotta get my hands on those Nobels. I
    was heartbroken to learn that the Guggenheim font was custom, and Nobel was the
    closest I could find to that.
