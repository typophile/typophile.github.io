  Meditations of Marcus Aurelius), and I have tried to track it down without success.\r\n\r\nI
  have found a sample, and discovered that a digital version was created by Tj\xF6rbj\xF6rn
  Olsson http://home.swipnet.se/~w-10011/Tobbe/Tobbe.html, but there is no option
  to purchase. Emails to his address are not delivered."

    love to do. If only to see what <em>The Meditations</em> looks like in that face!"

  body: "The site doesn't seem to offer options to purchase <em>any</em> of the fonts
    displayed there, although there are some dingbats for free download. Presumably,
    therefore, his fonts are sold through some other supplier; I'm going to see what
    MyFonts does.\r\n\r\nA search for \"Gemena\" popped up three font sites that don't
    have it. I don't know how they fooled Google.\r\n\r\nBut a search on the typographer's
    name turned up some of his faces that were on MyFonts - and those faces are available
    through the Swedish type foundry T4:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.t4.se/]]"
