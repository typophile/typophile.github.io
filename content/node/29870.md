  body: "Thanks Erik. That is close. The more I look around, the more I think it might
    be something that somebody cut all of the pointy bits off of by hand.\r\n\r\nJuan,
    if I'm translating you correctly I'll let you know if I figure it out. Unforunately,
    I don't have any other characters to show you. This is a logo and it's all I've
    seen of theirs.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSPENCER CROSS\r\n[professional] http://tokyofarm.com\r\n[personal]

  body: "After looking at a lot of blackletter typefaces while hunting for this, I
    am coming to the feeling that this is hand-drawn. The letterforms seem inconsistent,
    and over-simplified. The 'a' seems particularly out of place to me, considering
    the other letters. I think a broad pen-tip leads you to letters like this, probably
    guided by looking at some typefaces, but this doesn't seem like an attempt to
    recreate any particular typeface.\r\n\r\nI vote for hand-lettered. With no other
    letters to confirm this is a font, it will be hard to prove otherwise.\r\n\r\n-
