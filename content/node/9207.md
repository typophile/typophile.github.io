body: Looking to purchase some fonts I noticed that they can have a whole range of
  prices. <BR> <BR>On MyFonts.com there is a whole range of prices for both Swift
  and Clarendon ranging from about $17.50 &#40; Scangraphic Digital&#41; to $100.00
  &#40;Swift 2.0 [light only] from ParaType. <BR> <BR>Elsner &#43; Flake offers both
  faces for $34.95 each font. I seem to recall this foundries version being recommended
  by Robert Bringhurst in his book. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts/advice?

  body: The Elsner &#43; Flake version of Swift is the original. Swift 2.0 is the
    revised design.

  body: And the ParaType version has Cyrillic support added. Note that all weights
    are available on the <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?search=Swift+2%2E0&amp;fcode=PT_SWF">ParaType</a>
    site, not just light. The Latin version of Swift 2.0 is available at <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-swift.html">Gerard
    Unger</a>&#39;s site.
