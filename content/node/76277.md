    match in regard of style: the & has an Art Nouveau feel that the Rs lack.\r\nAlso,
    you should align the bottom flat terminal of the & to the one of the R."

    at some places.'

  body: I am not sure, but shall the ampersand represent an hourglass? If so, would
    expect, that the counters have the same size.

  body: Thanks for the critiques. As for the bumpy curves, it's probably because I
    haven't finalized the ampersand design yet. I am planning to smooth it out a bit
    more. Also, I'm on a search to find a better font for the Rs. I will work on the
    stuff you guys mentioned and try to come up with something better.

  body: "After trying a search for a new typeface for the R's, I tried playing around
    w/ the serifs of the existing R's and came up with something that I feel better
    harmonizes w/ the ampersand.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rnr2_5841.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    also aligned the bottoms of the Rs and the ampersand.\r\n\r\nThe ampersand still
    might have some slight irregularities but I'm planning on fixing everything when
    I vectorize it.\r\n\r\nAlso, Arno, do you mean the counters of the R's should
    have the same amount of space as the space in the bottom portion of the ampersand/hourglass?
    I feel they are quite similar unless you are referring to something else?"

    which uses an ornate art noveau-ish typeface that reminds me of your ampersand,
    but I can''t seem to find a digital version of this exact version. On a side note:
    That is one amazing book!'

  body: I believe Arno means, and I agree, that the top and bottom parts of the &
    should be closer to the same size in keeping with the common properties of an
    hourglass.

    actual example I would say, that the first R should be dragged slightly (one or
    two pixel) to left.\r\n\r\nYou also could try to horizontal mirror the left R,
    drop the ampersand and creating an hourglass in the negative shape between the
    R and the mirrored R. I mean, this cries for symmetry."
