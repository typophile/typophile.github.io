  giving some thought to our treasury's decision to bail out some large failed banks
  and all the attention it's getting lately and I've come to these conclusions:\r\nEveryone
  categorizes our options as being these two: namely <em>bail the suckers out</em>
  or <em>do nothing and suffer through a recession</em>.\r\nSince I'm from the Austrian
  school of economics, I see it like this: to bail out is to do nothing. That is to
  say, it does nothing to address the problem that caused the artificial boom. The
  reason we're in a 'crisis' at this point is because economic law, as it tends to
  <em>always</em> do, is now proposing an actual, feasible solution: the liquidation
  of bad debt.\r\nIf the congress thinks it can monetize its way out of a recession,
  they just as well repeal the law of gravity while they're at it.\r\nNow notice the
  words we're using: Bailout v. <em>Rescue plan</em>, Bust v. <em>Market correction</em>,
  Worthless junk v. <em>Illiquid assetts</em>. Notably, one of the 'toned-down' terms
  perfectly describes what is now occurring and exactly what we need: a market correction;
  and not surprisingly, that is precisely what our congress is trying to prevent,
  even at the peril of its reelection."
