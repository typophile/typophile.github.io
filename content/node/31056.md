body: "Aviano is an extended all caps face inspired by Trajan. I wanted the face to
  have extended letterforms for a more \u201Cformal\u201D look, and also more geometric
  and consistent letterforms. This is some early experimentation. I welcome any comments.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-R1_5692.gif]"

  body: i like some of the features of the letterforms, however, the contrast seems
    a bit off.  It actually reminds me of a Goth type font as opposed to Trajan.  Good
    luck with your experiments.  Repost when you have another version.

  body: When you first drew this, was it thinner than what you've posted? It looks
    as if it's been mechanically extended, rather than just drawn wide. Maybe it's
    in the brackets on your serifs--I think maybe they should start higher up on the
    stems. However, that might not be what I'm seeing at all. I also think your serifs
    are some too fine. Can you post a PDF?

  body: I agree with Nathanael it also feels like it's been mechanically pulled wide
    from another state rather than drawn wide in the 1st place. I don't like that
    feeling. Also, watch that kerning with the AV! I think you might want to draw
    this again. Maybe in Ink with a brush to get the relationships right.

  body: "I was also having troubles with how it looks mechanically pulled. Just so
    you know, it isn't. I wonder if the problem is that the extenstion isn't quite
    enough- it's sort of in limbo. Anyone have experience drawing extended typefaces?
    This is my first real attempt at it. The \"extension effect\" isn't as pronounced
    when you print it out.\r\n\r\nExcuse the kerning/spacing for now, I'm still working
    out the letterforms at this stage. I completed A-Z, and here is a .pdf, as requested.
    There could be some \"crunchies\" from the illustrator import still.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.insignedesign.com/files/avianosample.pdf"

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nNice, though I agree with the above posts on the wideness looking
    unnatural. It looks like a wide font that has been stretched even wider. See the
    G for example. Its left side looks almost pointy to me.\r\n\r\nI also think there
    are some problems with the balance of certain letters. Here I am talking about
    the S for instance. It looks top heavy. Make the top part a bit narrower maybe.
    The Z is leaning backwards (to the right, that is to me). The X is also unbalanced.
    The top and bottom part are probably equal in size but this makes it look unbalanced
    optically. Make less whitespace in the top part and it will start to balance.\r\n\r\nMagnus"

    really to get a feeling for why the letters should have one sort of shape rather
    than other when extending the Trajanic model you might really try using a brush.
    It's probably the only way to get the insight you need to do it & not make it
    look 'funny' or odd somehow.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tomkemp.com/book/index.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think what it wants is some squaring of the round. This is just a theory,
    but I--hold on. I'm not going to be able to use words well enough to say this.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/allpurposetemp_3770.PNG]\r\nOkay,
    my idea is that a font looks awkward if it has curves that are shallower than
    those in a circle. Curve a is shallower than a circle. Curve b is just as wide,
    but the curves aren't as shallow, so it looks sturdier. I think that's why your
    font looks artificially extended. Now, there may be a font or a person out there
    that contradicts my theory, but this is what my gut tells me is the solution."

  body: "To all that have commented,\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate your help and the
    time you have spent assisting me with this project. You all have some great points,
    and I am still working on addressing them.\r\n\r\nI have worked on eliminating
    the extended feel. I feel I have that pretty much worked out, but maybe I've been
    looking at it too long. \r\n\r\nNumber3Pencils, I pretty much came to the same
    conclusion that you did, when I was inking out the forms. After examining my strokes,
    I found the rounded forms had some unusual kinks. I've reworked those characters.\r\n\r\nI
    have attached a new .PDF file with some markings noting some areas I need to touch
    up and underlined characters that are so hideous they need reworking. I am primarily
    looking for areas that I missed, and your comments regarding the \"extension\"
    effect at this point. The numbers in particular have some balance issues.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, thanks for your assistance both with the design and motivating me to create
    a better typeface.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.insignedesign.com/files/avianor2.pdf\r\n\r\nJDooley"

  body: "How about dropping the lower join on he P? Extend the straights on the D
    it still looks 'pulled'. Your Z looks like it wants to leave the group. The C&G
    are much improved but still look a bit pulled. I think the H does not need to
    be that wide. The O seems a bit too heavy.\r\n\r\nBut I think the best thing would
    be to find a really good model to look at. I have a bunch of phtos I took in Rome
    that might be helpful too. But Flickr is down so maybe later.\r\n\r\n"

    think I should be clear about my objective. I am not necessarily trying to do
    \u201CTrajan Extended.\u201D I want to provide an alternative to someone that
    might be doing a job that would normally scream \u201CTrajan!\u201D My objectives
    were to have the typeface exhibit regular and even geometric styling, but with
    a heavy influence from the power and timeless beauty of Trajan.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with your comment about the O and Q, and have corrected the problem. For the P,
    I have added it as an OpenType alternate so it is available if desired.  I\u2019ve
    corrected the group. I was having problems balancing it and got distorted to the
    point it was almost obliqued. I think the C and G are ok, and I have reduced the
    size of the H.\r\nI have also extended the base of the E.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks
    to all for the assistance so far.\r\n\r\nPDF: http://www.insignedesign.com/files/avianor4.pdf\r\n\r\nJeremy

    the bowls of the U and u much more round. They are too pointy at the moment, and
    feel forced.\r\n\r\nYour serifs also all feel like they've been stretched out,
    rather than drawn out. Perhaps you could make them a little more \"slab\" like?
    Obviously, I don't mean that you should make them real slabs, or even wedge slabs\u2026
