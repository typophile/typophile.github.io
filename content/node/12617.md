body: " Hi, I\xB4ve been browsing the forums for quite a while, but this is actually
  my first post. I\xB4m willing to get some feedback and directions on two projects
  that I\xB4m currently working on for a contest (the deadline is may 27 for both
  of them).\r\n\r\nScenario 1: \r\nCristal fm - logo for a radio station, client guidelines
  as follows: modern, young (18-35 years old, middle-high socioeconomical class),
  prestige, frecuency number must be first in visual hierarchy, institutional color:
  green (no particular green, though), versatility of use (vertical banners, diverse
  merchandising, etc). Their current slogan translates to something like \"Music for
  real\".\r\n Well, with this briefing in mind (even though I found some of the guidelines
  contradictory) I came up with a rough sketch (the one with first-sketch in its filename).
  I showed it to the client on a preliminary meeting (again, the deadline is may 27)
  and he liked the versatility of use and posible articulation of its elements, but
  he wanted it to be more prestigious, so he \"suggested\" me to use a serif typeface.
  I don\xB4t think that using serifs is the only way to imply prestige, but he\xB4s
  the one that\xB4s making the choices in the final selection :)\r\n Please tell me
  what you think of it, suggestions, critiques, etc. Some pointers on how to solve
  the frecuency number typeface issue (I haven\xB4t really worked on it yet, it\xB4s
  getting on my nerves) will be really helpful.\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nHollywood -
  logo for another radio station (same owner), client guidelines: adult audience (35-40some
  years old, middle-high socioeconomical class), timeless plus 80\xB4s & 90\xB4s soft
  music classics, chill out, relaxation, versatility of use (it\xB4s one of those
  clients who wants his logos to do everything right). The client really liked the
  isotype (the relaxing guy icon) and the infinity double \"o\" ligature (related
  to the timeless & bonding concept, kinda cheesy to me). I didn\xB4t wanted to go
  retro on this logo because they\xB4re looking for a fresh new image (plus ALL the
  previous requirements).\r\nAgain, let me know your thoughts about it and any critiques/comments
  you may have, they\xB4re all welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nf\r\n\r\nPS:
  I\xB4m sorry for my pathetic english"

  body: "First, there is no need to apologise for your English.\r\nI don't think unicase
    is the way to go to hint at prestige I would look at more \"traditional\" serif
    faces. Also I wonder if you could make the circle round the frequency into a crystal
    so that the frequency on its own could be used if required. I found your first
    sketch more in keeping with the demographic although an alternative to the existing
    typeface might be more elegant Bliss leaps to mind but there are many alternatives,
    and look at upper and lower case. The fm ligature works very well in the first
    sketch version. \r\nFor the second I would also look at upper and lower case,
    this might sort out the spacing issues of the LYW, instead of the infinity moebius
    loop you could look at an oo ligature in the vein of Mrs Eaves. The point for
    the frequency should move up to align with the centre of the 3. The illustration
    is charming, but maybe it should move down a bit and the weight of the bubble
    chair stroke could be a bit lighter.\r\nTim"

  body: "fedezz, these days who cares about am or fm. Most radio stations have a link
    to on-line streaming. My point being, in emphsis bury the fm all together make
    it tiny. \r\n\r\nThe 107.9 cristal are static not dynamic. Make the 107.9 shape
    move or give it dimention. Maybe its exploding with sound, like how you would
    feel if you were stuck in front of a sub-woofer. That age group is a go-go group
    (think ipod, or ishuffle) media goes with them (cell phones with internet access).
    The type isn't the problem.\r\n\r\n101.3 Hollywood is just boring. Try doing something
    with the traditional Hollywood hills lettering. Also explore something classy
    and classic like a Tragian movie title look. The mark on the first version leaves
    me cold, it means nothing to anyone.\r\n\r\nNow you've made a good start, keep
    going, and post some more. Think less about design and more about your target
    audience and you will have winners."

  body: "timd: the problem with u/l cases is that I only have one ascendent in the
    whole word (l), and gives me a weird shape. In hollywood it gets even worse. What
    do you mean with \"make the circle into a crystal\"? The shape? Volume, 3d or
    some effect? Where can I get information about Bliss? I looked in myfonts.com
    and found no info there...\r\nRegarding the second logo, your comments were quite
    useful, I\xB4ll try to update that as soon as possible.\r\n\r\ndgweaver53m: actually,
    the client made emphasis in the importance of the station name being \"cristal
    fm\" (forbidding cristal, fm cristal or any other combination). I have no saying
    in that matter. I\xB4m keeping in mind the target, the problem is that reality
    is a little bit different here in Argentina than in Europe or the states :) The
    actual logo has the word \"Cristal\" set in an Illustrator-condensed Bodoni, and
    the client wants to mantain at least some relation with it. Besides, being a contest,
    I have to make peace between what I like and think about design and the client\xB4s
    willings :)\r\nActually I thought about the hills thing, but I think it\xB4s kinda
    cheesy, and it will not relate to the music or the concept. Also, it\xB4s supossed
    to comunicate calm, relax, chill.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, I will post
    some updates soon.\r\n"

  body: "I am not a fan of all uppercase setting, but you have ascenders (of a sort)
    with the C, i, and t. HOLLYWOOD set in uppercase gives you all kinds of problems
    with negative space around the centre of the word which, with application, you
    could reduce. I didn't want to dictate the shape of the final logo (and I'm not
    certain it will work) so I left the suggestion of shape hanging but you could
    start with a simple lozenge and introduce 3d, just to see if you think it will
    work. \r\nWhile you are looking at Bliss take a look at Aspect. \r\nWith re-reading
    my comments on the Hollywood illustration are not clear I meant the figure should
    move down to settle it into the chair.\r\nTim"

  body: "fedezz, my thought on the Hollywood hills lettering was about demographics
    (its dated), wouldn't be associated with anything but middle aged listeners. I
    didn't realize your dealing with a South American client. Try researching the
    lettering of the period of the music they play, maybe something will grab you.\r\n\r\nSince
    this is a competition, your competitors might try some more edgy designs and catch
    lightning in a bottle. Don't paint yourself into a corner or you will loose. My
    problem with your logos is they aren't promotional enough yet. They don't screem
    enough, and radio stations scream!"

  body: "Dan, \r\nI would suggest that using fonts from the 80s and 90s would produce
    a logo not quite dated enough to be retro and in fact might appear in need of
    an update. As for the Hollywood Hills lettering when does that date from?\r\nTim"
