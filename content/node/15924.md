  I read too many forums about formal aspect of design and how things should look.
  It's often a good read, like many of the topics about typography on this forum.
  But being right or let's say \u2014educated\u2014 about design doesn't mean that
  you can sell your \u201Ceducated design\u201D to your clients. I often find myself
  struggling to explain to my clients why I think their brochure should be designed
  one way instead of another. \r\nAny suggestion?\r\n\r\nCheers \r\n\r\n\r\nSeb"

    auto repairman to remove your wisdom teeth? Would you trust a dentist to fly a
    747? Professionals are professionals for a reason: they know their business and/or
    trade. So, why trust an accountant to design a brochure?'

  body: "Hi Oldnick,\r\n\r\nI have the impression that you misunderstand my thread.
    I, as a graphic designer find it sometimes difficult to justify a design solution
    to my clients. I don't beleive in telling them that they should trust me simply
    on the basis that I am graphic designer. That would not only be percieved as arrogant
    it's also not true. My clients should trust me because I can demonstrate why my
    solutions are better than that of an accountant turned designer. This is the reality
    of our business today. The Design God may strike me for saying this but an accountant
    turned designer could actualy pull a convincing design and sell it better that
    I. Today anyone can put text on a page and trust InDesign to do the hard work
    for you. Technicaly that's enough to convice a client to work with you. But what
    happens when the client wants the his logo pink because his wife likes pink. That's
    a problem no plumber or a 747 pilot has to face in his job."

  body: "I know your struggle...\r\n\r\nOften it comes down to trust. Does your client
    trust you to make the correct decisions about their company. \r\nA good start
    is to read this excellent book: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1581153244/qid=1130754455/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-6575909-3256946?v=glance&s=books&n=507846\r\n\r\nBasically
    it's about turning the often subjective likes-not likes of design and make it
    objective. Begin with rough sketches, describing the different concepts, get a
    sign off and continue on in a step by step process... \r\n\r\nBack it up with
    research about the target group, the competitors etc. Then you can say he doesn't
    want to have pink as his main competitor use pink and that he does not want to
    be mixed up...\r\n\r\nthen it's not what you like, or what s/he likes but what
    s/es client needs.\r\n\r\nOf-course, there is always exceptions. But you can always
    ask in the very beginning if there is anything to avoid or embrace, designwise.\r\n\r\n/fredde\r\n"

  body: "Sebastien,\r\n\r\nIn regards to your search for Forums that address \"client
    management\" I have from time to time found interesting articles that raise issues
    concerning <em>client, peer and self-critique</em> in the <a href=\"http://www.designobserver.com\"
    target=\"new\"><em>Design Observer</em></a>.\r\n\r\nAdrian Shaughnessy's article,
    <a href=\"http://www.designobserver.com/archives/006599.html\" target=\"new\"><em>Can
    you make the type bigger?</em></a> talks specifically to the love-hate and \"I'm
    smarter than you are\" relationship between designer and client, and the business
    of doing business.\r\n\r\nOn another level entirely is Rick Poynor's article <a
    href=\"http://www.designobserver.com/archives/006477.html\" target=\"new\"><em>Where
    Are the Design Critics?</em></a> in which he observes the absence of <em>oppositional
    criticism</em> and the values that critique currently serves:\r\n<dl><dt><dd>It
    [Design] is one of the ways in which capitalism is most obviously expressed, and
    never more so than today when design is widely regarded as a miracle ingredient
    with the power to seduce the consumer and vanquish less design-conscious competitors.

  body: "I am surprised that there is so little about the business side of design
    out there. You either have the self-help book written by a self-made multimillion
    dollar designer or you find some derogatory posts on blogs about how stupid clients
    can be. You only have to check <a href=http://www.clientcopia.com>clientcopia</a>
    and you'll have an idea of the level of frustration the design industry feels
    about his <em>client\xE8le</em>. \r\n<em>Can you make the type bigger?</em>\u2014and
    I stress here that they are rarely asking to make the type better\u2014  is the
    kind of thing we hear everyday from our clients, unfortunatly there is very little
    in the way to educate designers on how to respond intelligently to that kind of
    requests. However, we have unumerable, blogs, forums, books etc. about making
    type better. So why as an industry that posseses the tools to communicate very
    effectively do we not address this problem more frankly. With all the designers
    working around the globe there must be enough knowledge about client management
    to fill hundreds of blogs et al. \r\n\r\nI know what I will ask Santa\r\n\r\n"
