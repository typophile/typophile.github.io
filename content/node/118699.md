  book. \r\n\r\nProblem #1: The body copy on most of the products is sans-serif so
  the boss wants to keep all of the body copy as sans-serif. I've tried Trade Gothic,
  Frutiger, Avant Garde, Franklin Gothic, Futuri, Avenir Next, and Univers and they
  are all difficult to read in my opinion.\r\n\r\nProblem #2: There are some pages
  that have plenty of space and not that much text, but there are also pages that
  are FULL of text so I need a typeface that I can set at small sizes and tight leading
  and still be readable. Maybe a typeface with a condensed option in addition to the
  normal weight?\r\n\r\nProblem #3: This product is also \"reproduceable\" so I need
  a typeface that is still readable on black and white copies.\r\n\r\nIs this is even
  feasible? If I can get my company to pay for them, what do you think about using
  FF Legato, Sensibility, or Whitney?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    named some typefaces that are highly readable as text, and you've listed some
    that are less so. I suspect that you might think that sans-serif text, in general,
    is less legible than serif text, which can be debated from both pro and con points
    of view.\r\n\r\nStill, unless you're designing something for yourself, your opinions
    on readability should take a back seat to the target audience's opinions. Of course
    you can't really survey them all to find their preferences, but people tend to
    think that the typefaces they're most familiar with are most readable. So if you
    want to play it safe, you might consider using a common, all-purpose, generic
    sans-serif, like Helvetica or Myriad.\r\n"

    \u201Cspace-saving\u201D but it\u2019s relatively heavy, so you should be able
    to set it a little smaller. I haven\u2019t used the other ones you mention. "

  body: "An often overlooked factor is the is the confusion between _1_, _l_ and _I_
    in many sans-serif fonts. I would suggest that for body copy you avoid fonts where
    you cannot tell them apart except by context.\r\nI find Tang to be very readable
    as, even at very small point sizes, perhaps partly because of the use of ink traps
    as a design feature. Seven weights 22 variants.  Check particularly the book and
    book small caps. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/tang/\r\nDon"

    expressly designed to save space and hold up well under poor printing conditions
    while simultaneously being easy to read at small sizes.\r\n\r\nAxel is also very
    similar to -- albeit narrower than -- Officina."
