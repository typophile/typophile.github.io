  body: I really like this, it's got a friendly roundness and economy seldom found
    in grotesques. That "g" is a nice touch! I would really like to take a closer
    look, could you post a pdf? That will make it much easier to criticise, at this
    resolution anti-aliasing artifacts play tricks on stems and curves.

  body: "I like it too. It's nice to see caps like /B/E/P/S/ not be stretched towards
    square as in typical grotesques.\r\n\r\nI think the black versions of the letters
    are better, but would you consider including, say, the brown /r/ and /R/ as alternates?
    (And maybe an alt /g/?)\r\n\r\nI think /b/ and /p/ taper too much at the top intersection
    - it knocks the glyph out of character IMO. \r\n\r\n/e/ might be too fat where
    the crossbar intersects (and/or too thin at the southwest) (but Sindre's right,
    we need a pdf to judge).\r\n\r\nThe /g/ is clearly the signature glyph. Right
    now the shape of the link seems a bit indecisive but it's hard to see exactly
    what's going on there at this resolution.\r\n\r\n/W/ looks quite wide. /d/ may
    be a bit narrow.\r\n\r\nThe black /G/ looks very ellipsoid - should you bump the
    corners of the curve out, at least on the bottom?\r\n\r\nOn the /M/ I think you
    could spread the upper vertices out even a bit more and let the side counters
    creep up a touch more.\r\n\r\nI wonder if that /f/ crossbar's length on the right
    will make spacing difficult.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to see this develop.\r\n"

    'short' /r/ and Hrant (on flickr) suggested me to try with something like this
    (at least, this is my interpretation of a \"faucet\" beak), and I find it more
    interesting. \r\n/W/: yes, I simply joined two /V/ (not the 'correct' way, I know)
    to see what happens. I need to compress a bit or I can try with an 'overlapping'
    W, I have to think about it.\r\n/R/: I also think the curved-leg /R/ is better\r\n\r\nCraig,
    'where the crossbar [of /e/] intersects did you mean on the left side?\r\n\r\nNow
    I also see that uppercase letters are too heavy, what do you think?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree on the \"r\", it adds to the quaint character. But I would work a
    little more on the shape, and perhaps start the joint a little lower. Keep in
    mind that such an \"r\" will create spacing issues. \r\n\r\nI too prefer the curved-leg
    \"R\". \r\n\r\nDon't worry too much about weight differences in this typeface.
    I think it suits this style. Just look at MT Grotesque, where the difference is
    much more pronounced than this. \r\n\r\n\"a\" needs some work. It's a great shape,
    but take another look at the curves. \r\n\r\nI've never been a fan of MT Grotesque-like
    slanted-cut \"c\"s, but it seems to work here. The uppercase \"C\" I'm more uncertain
    of. Have you tried equal cut angels?\r\n\r\nI agree on the bowl to stick-joins,
    but don't overdo the adjustment. Some contrast will work just fine here.  \r\n\"e\"
    counter looks a little too egg-shaped.\r\n\r\n\"f\" and \"t\": Curves again a
    little uncertain. \r\n\r\n\"g\": Very different counters, one is square, the other
    is not. And I think a monoline join would look better.\r\n\r\n\"s\": Needs some
    smoothing. Perhaps slightly top-heavy?\r\n\r\n\"w\" and \"W\" and \"M\" all look
    heavy. X-es need some cross-compensation. \r\n\r\n\"U\" needs a more generous
    curve.\r\n\r\nI have little time now, this was a very quick run-through. I'll
    have another look later. And please take my advice with some salt, I'm not a pro.\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the good work! This is going to be great."

    I think the situation is that the top closed counter doesn't go as far left as
    the bottom open counter so it picked up a row of pixels in the jpg."

    that /W/, although it doesn't look half bad in \"BROWN.\" Maybe inch the \"V\"s
    a bit closer, and make sure the strokes in the middle don't get too spindly at
    the top.\r\nI'm not sure which /r/ in the pdf is the right one to be reviewing,
    but I prefer the shear angle on the gray one.\r\nI think /b/ and /p/ are improved
    and I don't think they pose any problem for /m/ and /n/ as they are.\r\nOn the
    /g/, I might try heightening the lower loop and shortening the link correspondingly,
    just a little bit.\r\nForgot to say that /w/ is too wide too.\r\n/C/ looks much
    better to me. I like /j/ too.\r\nOne thing about /a/ that bothers me is this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grottesco-3-2-2010_4727_4916.gif]\r\nThe
    lower contour of the tail implies a stem that is quite a bit off from what is
    determined by the right side of the counter. Perhaps just changing the control
    vector angle of that tail contour as it comes out of the acute angle to something
    less vertical would fix the issue."

    the 'disconnection' of the tail was exaggerated, in the image below you can see
    two alternatives (the black one is my choice, the first grey is slightly different
    and the last is the original.)\r\n\r\nI've also made /v/ and /w/ a bit lighter

    your point, but I don't want to change it (for 'sentimental' reasons), you can
    see it as the 'Nuovo' part of the 'Grottesco'.\r\nTo avoid too much anachronisms
    I've removed the 'overlapping' /W/ and moved toward a more conventional one (and
    also narrower than before).\r\n\r\nBelow you can also see the numbers (4 needs

  body: "Those letter changes are good.\r\nI think the figures 2, 4, and 7 all have
    the same problem - the shear at the acute angle. With a face like this my eye
    wants to see that vertical as the termination of the horizontal stroke, but the
    vertical shear is clearly longer than that termination would be.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/274_6522.png]\r\nNot
    that the nodes should align mathematically, of course, but I think this may be
    at the root of why those particular figures stand out as clunkier than the others.\r\nI
    think a 7 stem that gently arced, and narrowed towards the corner, could work
    well in this font. \r\nRelated to this, the bottom right corner of /N/ also looks
    too thick to me."
