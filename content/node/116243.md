  body: "The original typeface is an Art Nouveau one shown in the Petzendorfer book
    from Dover Books. The typeface name was \"Pretorian\" from the London firm of
    P. M. Shanks & Sons. \r\n\r\nIntellecta Design has a font based on this called
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/pretoria-gross/?refby=bowfin|Pretoria
    Gross]], which includes various ornamental treatments using the letters, as well
    as the plain black and outline versions of the typeface.\r\n\r\nAnother is called
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/pretorian-dt/?refby=bowfin|Pretorian DT]]
    by DTP Types. It has 4 versions.\r\n\r\nFontBank had a version called \"Vivian\",
    and Serials (or whatever they are called now) had a family called \"Pretoria\".\r\n\r\n-
