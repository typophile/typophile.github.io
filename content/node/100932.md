  body: hhp - Good question. I come across hundreds of fonts (mainly in pdfs) that
    have names that are almost, but not quite the same as well-known faces. Sometimes
    they are corporate licensed variations, such as NYTLyon used by the NYTimes, but
    many others, like the one cited in this thread, seem arbitrary. I wonder whether
    they have been modified, then renamed to avoid confusion, renamed to bypass embedding
    restrictions, or whatever. In any case, the alterations may or may not be legal
    or ethical; I know of no way to know which is which.  - Herb

    of the font name (and the font is legit, licensed by Font Bureau).  The culprit
    here seems to be the web inspector: it should display the font name, not some
    irrelevant information like a filename of some weird combination of digits and
    letters (which, in fact, is also the filename).\r\n\r\n"

  body: No, Safari is simply displaying the filename which is not identical to the
    serial number. The main problem is generating unique serial numbers and keeping
    track of the licensees. Automatically adding that information to the font should
    pose no problem.

  body: "1) So in the case you cited above, the font's actual filename <em>looked
    like</em> a serial number but wasn't*, and that's what Safari's inspector displayed?\r\n2)
    Is it really that hard to generate a unique serial number when somebody downloads
    something (and index that with other info from the downloading party)? I would
    think automatically inserting the serial number into the font file would be harder.
    How would you do it?\r\n\r\n* Perhaps this number is mapped to the actual serial
    number in a database. Why make them different? Maybe so third parties can't know
    the serial number?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>\r\nElsewhere I suggested that ttx could be used for this purpose\u2026\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThat
    looks like the most simple way to do it. You just apply \"ttx -t name\" to your
    font file to get filename.ttx. If your field 13 (there are two occurrences of
    it) is something like<PRE>\r\n----\r\nAbracadabra licensed\r\n----</PRE>\r\nyou
    replace it with something like</PRE>\r\n----\r\nAbracadabra licensed &#13;&#10;Serial
    Number: SSEERRIIAALL\r\n----</PRE>\r\nand then if you have some file <code>serials.txt</code>
    with serial numbers, say\r\n<PRE>\r\n----\r\nAB1234CD56\r\nEV3144EF45\r\n----\r\n</PRE>\r\nexecuting
    the script\r\n<PRE>\r\n----\r\nfor i in `cat serials.txt` \r\ndo \r\n  sed \"s/SSEERRIIAALL/$i/\"
    filename.ttx > $i.ttx\r\n  ttx -m filename.ttf $i.ttx\r\ndone\r\n----\r\n</PRE>\r\nwill
    produce the files <code>AB1234CD56.ttf</code> and <code>EV3144EF45.ttf</code>
    with those serial numbers inside (one font file per line in <code>serials.txt</code>).\r\n\r\nEven
    for something more complicated, I don't think you need an xml parser; <code>sed</code>
    and <code>ttx</code> can do the job.\r\n"

    you could make up your own custom sfnt table format. If you add an \xBBunknown\xAB
