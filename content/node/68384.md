  a 2,048 em unit when I open a glyph window, as well as the fact that, more often
  than not, the Preview Panel refuses to display the names of OpenType features, much
  less offer a preview of same.\r\n\r\nNow, I have encountered a different problem.
  I just made a font based on an old MacKellar, Smiths and Jordan banner typeface
  which includes the banner image as a component element of all alphabetic character,
  along with component diacritics on the accented characters. When I generated font
  files, the TrueType version was flawless; the CFF version, on the other hand, dropped
  both the banner and the diacritics on over a dozen accented characters.\r\n\r\nI
  managed to solve the problem by decomposing ALL of the characters and regenerating
  the CFF version. What is odd, though, is that the new file is exactly the same size
  as the defective file it replaced. WTF?\r\n"

    Font Format\" because it uses compression algorithms to collapse redundant data.
    Composites do essentially the same thing. So is probably why the font is no bigger
    after conversion. (This is my understanding, anyway.)\r\n\r\nBTW, for OT features
    to show up in the Preview panel, you need to compile them first."

    in OpenType PS fonts, there''s a preference setting for that. Perhaps you accidentally
    disabled it. '
