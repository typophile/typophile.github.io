  I need too use on mac OS X to get the Ldot character. It's called Ldot in Fontlab,
  it's and L with a dot just inside it.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. "

    to Catalan, but what keys do I use to get the character.\r\n\r\nc."

    glyphs? With Minion Pro it actually only says glyph 771, and doesn't give any
    unicode results.\r\nIf your font has the glyph, you can access it via glyph pallette
    in InDesign and Illustrator\r\nIf you're designing a font I can't help, sorry."

    Viewer & Show input menu in menu bar. That\u2019s more helpful than character
    palette if you have to access the glyphs frequently and can change the keyboard
    layout."

  body: "Coop, \r\n\r\nkeep in mind to design the ldot/Ldot so that: \r\n\r\n* When
    ldot is immediately followed by the normal l, and when Ldot is immediately followed
    by the normal L, the dot in ldot/Ldot appears visually centered between the two
    l/L's. \r\n\r\n* There should be no implied wordspace between \u0140 and l, so
    a word like \"co\u0140lecci\xF3\" should look like one word, the space between
    the two \"l\"s should not be visibly larger than between other letters. \r\nThis
    is a similar recommendation to what you should do with the \"apostrophic caron\"
    for Czech and Slovak: the word \"\u010F\xE1bel\" should have no implied wordspace,
    very much unlike the English \"don\u2019t\", where the apostrophe can have some
    space on its own. For this reason, the dot in ldot, and the apostrophic caron
    in dcaron, tcaron, lcaron should be designed very \"sparsely\"."
