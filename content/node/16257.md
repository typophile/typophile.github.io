body: Has anyone else experienced this? In the Metrics window I'm typing characters
  directly and they won't appear. i can get them to show up if i type a slash before
  the character name, ie /ampersand for &, but it shouldn't be that hard. any ideas?

  body: even odder... i just exported the fonts as TT fonts and tried printing from
    InDesign. They showed up in the app, but they would not print. What am i doing
    wrong?

  body: well i was able to work around it by opening a new font and doing the Merge
    Fonts feature. I thought it may have been something to do with names or unicode
    not being generated properly, but i kept trying to regenrate both names and unicode
    without any avail. I'm baffled by this...

  body: "i don't know if this is the same thing, but i had a similar problem recently
    in Fontographer when i imported the glyphs via an illustrator eps. \r\n\r\ni was
    importing them just fine, but when i typed them out in the metrics window, they
    didn't show up. then when i exported the font, the glyphs showed up.\r\n\r\ni
    found that it had to do with the fill in illustrator. i went back to illustrator,
    turned the fill off (also went into outline mode so i could see the glyphs), and
    re-imported them into Fontographer. this cleared up the problem. i have no idea
    why, or if that's the problem you are having but i hope it helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n(side
    note)\r\n\r\nhowever, importing the glyphs from illustrator lead to another issue
    having to do with the scale. it seemed like the glyphs would change size depending
    on the amount and placement of the glyphs that made up the import groups.\r\n\r\nis
    this a common problem that is easy to fix? should i start a new thread?\r\n---------\r\nnc"

  body: "<em>Scaling Problem\r\nImporting (from illustrator- saved down to 3.0) groups
    of multiple glyphs into Fontographer.</em>\r\n\r\nFontographer normally will scale
    artwork to the height of the em square. The trick is to include, as part of your
    artwork, a box or line that corresponds to the ascent and descent of your font.
    As long as your artwork is not taller than this box (or line), it will always
    import at the same scale. (This is a very old FOG trick that many wish FontLab
    could do.)"
