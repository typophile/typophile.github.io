body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Coranto_release_6390.gif]\r\n\r\nWe are
  very happy to welcome Gerard Unger and his typeface Coranto 2 to the TypeTogether
  family. Gerard is an internationally acclaimed designer whose work and teachings
  have, for years, inspired many others to follow in his footsteps. He has earned
  numerous Dutch and international prizes and honours, including two honorary doctorates
  by the universities of Hasselt, Belgium and Tallinn, Estonia. He publishes articles
  and lectures internationally, and his book Terwijl je leest \u2014 about reading
  \u2014 has been translated into English, Italian, Spanish and German.\r\n\r\nCoranto
  2 is originally based on Unger\u2019s typeface Paradox, and arose from a desire
  to transfer the elegance and refinement of that type to newsprint. This update to
  the original Coranto includes the addition of over 250 glyphs featuring full Latin
  A language support (which includes the necessary accented letters for Northern and
  Central European languages), redesign of most accents, new ligatures, 4 sets of
  numerals, arbitrary fractions and superiors/inferiors. Furthermore, kerning was
  added and fine-tuned for better performance.\r\n\r\nmore information: http://www.type-together.com/Coranto%202\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coranto1_4026.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coranto2_5145.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coranto3b-1_4496.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coranto4b_4249.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coranto5_4401.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coranto6_4081.gif]"
