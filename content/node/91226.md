  with a bunch of adults who probably will doubt what I can do, but I don''t care
  I''m trying it anyway (: I''m looking for a program that is SIMPLE to use, as far
  as typography goes.. What goes into typography? Do you type a word then move it
  to how you want it moved? I don''t think it''d be that simple, just someone please
  try to explain basic steps to typography and how to start.. Thanks (: (Btw I''m
  14)'

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nTo help answer your questions, I think Ellen Lupton's [[http://www.thinkingwithtype.com|Thinking
    With Type]] is a good starting point. The book is well worth checking out, and
    I'm sure the website will give you plenty to absorb. I also suggest looking at
    the books listed at [[http://dunwichtype.com/typelibrary/|Type Library]], especially
    those under general typography.\r\n\r\nMost professionals use [[http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html|Adobe
    InDesign]] to create layouts that are typographically good, for print at least
    (It costs a lot, but Adobe does offer student discounts. Check to see if your
    school has it installed in any of their labs. There is also a free 30-day trial
    you can download.) Good typography is more a result of decisions made by a designer,
    and less about the specific tools used. You can make something nice in Microsoft
    Word, it just takes more effort.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps. Good luck.\r\n\r\n(It
    seems that you know that typography is not the same as type design, but just to
    make sure: the drawing of letters/making of fonts is type design, the arrangement/layout/spacing/etc.
    of text is typography.) "

    :)\r\n\r\nI suspect that you will be blown away when you look at the price of
    InDesign. However, you can get 30 day trials of the software free, and if you
    put in a lot of time with it, you will learn a lot. As well as InDesign, Adobe
    also has Photoshop and Illustrator as other types of programs that have typographic
    components. You could move onto those after your InDesign trial runs out.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a lot of good tutorials for all these programs on the web in general, and
    Adobe's site in particular. \r\n\r\nFinally, there is a free program called GIMP
    that works like Photoshop, and one called Serif that works (a bit) like InDesign.
    You can go to these if you can't con your parents into buying the Adobe software."

    that newbie question. ^_^ I came here to learn the basics as well. I've been told
    to join forums, and not only depend on books.\r\nAnyway, thanks for pointing out
    good books!\r\n\r\nwish you all the best,\r\n\r\n\r\nJanryC"
