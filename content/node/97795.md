body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am having problems with the kerning of Postscript fonts from URW
  (older ones from 1994). These used to work effortlessly in CS3 and before, but now
  they give the curious problem that the bold weights from a suitcase do not show
  kerning, where the regular weights show it normally. URW used to issue their fonts
  (from the typeworks collection) in different forms, the \"family\" way: as suitcases
  containing regular, italic, bold, bold italic (when available) or as seperate suitcase
  for each weight. The kerning works for the single weights, but does not for the
  family, or at least not for the bold weights.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea why this
  is the case, does it have to do with CS5.5, or does it have to do with the OS (lion)??\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: Could it have something to do with a joint AFM file in the family collection
    not being interpreted or recognized correctly? Also, how are you activating the
    fonts, through the system, through a font manager or through the application fonts
    folder?

    font folder as well (first deactivating in FEX) just to see if it makes a difference.

  body: What is strange as well, is that it seems to work for some fonts, but not
    for others, but I have not yet found out what the differences are, some have different
    names for the different weights, like book or medium, which seems to make a difference.
    Another confusing thing is, that bitstream Postscript fonts seem to have no problem.
    Perhaps this is a specific naming issue??

    this still leaves the question, what causes this problem, and could it be solved
    in an easier way? I use FEX because I want to make font management easy and to
    keep the overview, now I have to start dragging font files around, which of course
    increases the chance of errors. And I do not understand that my old Mac with the
    old Indesign did seam to handle it."

    1 fonts. Anything you got on an older machine had to do with its older OS. Equally,
    anything you get now with your Lion setup <em>must</em> be courtesy of FontExplorer,
    because it cannot be the system itself.\r\nSo check if FEX has a history, dealing
    with Type 1 fonts."

  body: "Many have said that the days of Postscript Type 1 support at the system level
    are numbered. It appears that with Lion & Snow Lion those days have run out.\r\n\r\nBecause
    it uses its own font-rendering engine, Adobe is likely to privately support Postscript
    Type 1 longer than the Macintosh operating systems, although perhaps unofficially.
    So, making the fonts available to Adobe apps via one of the Adobe Application
    or Application Support > Fonts folders will enable Postscript Type 1 fonts to
    be fully functional even when they are not otherwise supported (but only within
    the Adobe suite).\r\n\r\nAs you have discovered, Jeffrey."

    fonts in the System/Library/Fonts folder, no Postscript data is distributed with
    the operating system (referring specifically to Lion 10.7.3) but it is possible
    to add Macintosh formatted Postscript Type 1 fonts to the system font folders.
    I was able to add a Postscript Type 1 collection to the Library/Fonts folder which
    was then recognised by FontBook and picked up by TextEdit, Word 2011 and Adobe
    CS6.\r\n"

  body: Hmmm. Karl, I bet you are right, and I mixed up plain vanilla Type 1 files
    (pfb, pfm, afm) with the specially formatted Mac versions. On a Mac, the former
    are usable only by Adobe applications. I haven't seen the latter for some decades
    now, so I assumed they went out of style long ago.

    did not get picked up by the system or show up in any applications. However, as
    you (and Kent) say, adding it to the Applications/Adobe InDesign CS6/Fonts folder
    did make it show up in InDesign."

  body: So, if I would like to still use these fonts, I have to either dump them the
    application fonts folder (which is inpractical) or convert these to OpenType?
    If I would want to do the second, what is the best way? I have tries FontXchange,
    but this does weird things to font names, and gives unpredictable results, so
    I don't want to use that. any ideas?

    them then conversion to OpenType would definitely be your best course of action.
    I am not familiar with FontXchange but I generally use FontLab or FontForge to
    do this kind of work. "
