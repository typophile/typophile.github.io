    is everything. Everything!\u201D\r\n~ Crack Dealer\r\n\r\n#biased\r\n\r\nA better
    way to put it would be to say:\r\n\r\n\u201CDoing things \u2018by design\u2019
    as opposed to by accident, intuition, guesswork &c. is important.\u201D\r\n~ Chris
    Dean\r\n\r\nThis means simply taking into account the user, goals, and resources,
    and developing a solution that meets the requirements. In this case, \u201Cdesign
    thinking\u201D isn\u2019t something unique to graphic designers or a magical power,
    <strong>it\u2019s basic common sense</strong>. Which sadly, our (primarily North
    American) \u201Cculture\u201D lacks as a collective given the current state of
    global affairs. \r\n\r\nWill graphic designers save the world? Hell no. In fact,
    we are expediting its demise by putting tits on things so people want to buy them.
    What <em>will</em> save the world is a shift in global consciousness forced upon
    us my massive social, political, economic, and environmental catastrophe will
    do it for us.  I suppose, following this logic, you could say that anything we
    do to expedite global demise might actually be putting us one step closer to destruction,
    and eventually rebirth, but that\u2019s debatable.\r\n\r\nWow. All that from a
    font? Quitting smoking (again) sucks."
