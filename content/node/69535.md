  but it's not. It's used throughout the spectacular Van Gogh Exhibit at London's
  Royal Academy of Art. I apologize for the quality of the pictures but had security
  seen me taking them, they probably would've cut off MY ear.\r\n\r\nMany thanks:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3319_6326.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3322_5569.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3328_5106.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3327_3576.jpg]"
