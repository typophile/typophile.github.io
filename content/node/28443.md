  body: This looks like the ITC version of Bookman Swash Italic, which is available
    from <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/mondosearchresults.htm?st=12&kid=bookman%20swash">Monotype</a>.

  body: "I agree that the ITC version seems to match. From looking at both the A &
    B versions of the Jukebox version it also seems to have these same characters,
    or is at least close enough to be an alternative.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The biggest difference between the two version is the lowercase italics. The
    ITC version has true italics, while the older (ATF?) version has obliqued romans.

  body: "Yes, I see that, after printing out the character map from the Jukebox font
    and looking at the ITC page. There are a few other differences like the W in the
    sample, which doesn't appear in the Jukebox font at all, as far as I can see.
    \r\n\r\nYou are right Justin, it's the ITC version for sure.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"
