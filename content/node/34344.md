body: "I've recently rediscovered [[Gill Sans]] after purchasing Gill Sans MT Pro.
  I love its lighter weights and am finding it very versatile -- I'm feeling pretty
  good about choosing it as the display face for our organization's identity. Plus,
  the ease and versatility of this new Pro version makes things easy and cool.\r\n\r\nNow
  I need to find a serifed text face to go with it. For the moment, I've been using
  my old flame, Scala, and I really do love how they work together. But Scala is getting
  more and more common, and I'm wondering if there isn't something new or old that
  I've overlooked. And if I'm going to replace Scala, a must is that it's with an
  OTF with a full character set: I'm a busy guy.\r\n\r\nThis is for a performing arts
  presenter. We're trying to reposition ourselves as a multidisciplinary cultural
  organization. I've been using some bright colors with lots of white space and leading.\r\n\r\nI
  want to be sold on something I haven't thought of. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n(I've attached
  some details from a brochure we put out this week to give you an idea of how we're
  thinking.)"
