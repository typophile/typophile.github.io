  in the same vein and spirit as Burgues and Compendium, <strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/bellissima-script-pro/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Bellissima</a></strong> began from an entirely different thread
  as those fonts. It started with Alex Trochut generously showing me a gorgeous lettering
  book from his grandfather's library: Bellezas de la Caligraf\xEDa, by Ram\xF3n Stirling,
  1844. Stirling was one of the Latin calligraphy pioneers who introduced a refined
  version of English calligraphy in Spain and made it popular in the nineteenth century.\r\n
  \r\nSome scans from that book served as initial basis for the caps in my Poem Script.
  But it was always in the back of my mind that I should do a copperplate, and the
  Stirling model was the perfect source. My intention was to veer away from Stirling's
  exuberant ornamentation, and work within simplified forms of his ideas. As it usually
  is with most of my projects, Bellissima became its own bird and shaped its own flying
  patterns. Suddenly there were many ligatures, multiple endings and swashed connections,
  hundreds of alternates for both uppercase and lowercase.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophi_beau_4374.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophi_krasny_6483.jpg]\r\n
  \r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/bellissima-script-pro/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Bellissima</a></strong> has an effusive energy that appeals much
  beyond its sourcing. It's intended for these modern times of appreciation for old
  crafty things like stationary and letterpress, where its origins  help it shine
  brightly.\r\n \r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/bellissima-script-pro/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Bellissima Script Pro</a></strong> is a complete font with almost
  2000 characters full of alternates, swashes, ligatures & ornaments covering a wide
  palette of latin languages and Bellissima Script Redux is a random sample of glyphs
  totally usable with a reduced price.\r\n \r\n3D art in that <strong><a href=\"www.sudtipos.com/downloads/Bellissima_Specimen.pdf\"
