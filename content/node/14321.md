  following instructions were kindly provided by [[David Berlow]]:\r\n\r\nAside from
  the argument of terms, and what is [[Italic]], if you are making a sloping style
  to compliment a non-sloping style, here is the general start to a [[sans serif]]
  design. \r\nAll ascents and descents, [[x-height|x-heights]], [[cap height|cap heights]]
  and figure heights stay the same. (that\u2019s the good news). \r\nThe widths are
  between 92% and 96% of the non-sloping style, the main stems are 94% to 98% of the
  non-sloping style. The actual percentages you choose are ball-parked by the overall
  width and weight of the source, but depend ultimately on the eyes in your head.
  The reason for this is that the sloping of a style makes it wider, and heavier to
  the eye, and you need to fix that first, before you even slope. \r\n\r\nAfter you
  do, (8-11 degrees according to taste, size of use, and speed of traffic, you have
  lots of curves and diagonals to correct: \r\nCurves between 4 and 5 o\u2019clock
  and 10 and 11, you need to push out, between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock, and 7 and 8 o\u2019clock.
  pull in. \r\nThe diagonals fall into two disturbed groups as well. The ones that,
  in house framing, would have stopped the slope from happening, need to be thinned,
  those that helped push it over need to be thickened. \r\nThen, you have to choose
  whether you\u2019re going to put all the points on extrema, and if so, you have
  to re-digitize, or if you use the green gem in FL to fix it up for ya, you\u2019ll
  want to make a copy to the mask beforehand, so you can see where that tool fails.
  \r\nSpacing should be about the same as the non-sloping style and you should be
  ready to proof\u2026\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13743\">Tips
