  some comments on my favorite ones of the bunch:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elevate_6579.jpg]\r\ni
  love the typeface and the fact that without even using words, the club can have
  a logo just from the elevate symbol found within the word\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fold_5493.jpg]\r\nsimply
  love the concept and simlicity\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/food_5675.jpg]\r\nwonderfully
  and subtly combines food, photos, and blogging into one neat and compact logo\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mansion_4268.jpg]\r\nthe
  epitome of subtlety, i didn't even notice the intricate design in the background
  of what first appears to be an oversimplified logo\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/music_6321.jpg]\r\njust
  a well executed concept using the piano keys to form the letters of the logo, as
  well as a nice choice of type for the words\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talk_5177.jpg]\r\njust
  a plain good logo\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pen_4812.jpg]\r\ni
  must admit, i didn't get it at first, but after seeing that the logo was representing
  the food writers, i couldn't stop thinking about what a smart, simplified logo it
  is"
