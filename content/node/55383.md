  Tokodi as my \"favorite designer.\" (...in quotes because I don't per say have a
  favorite designer, but her stuff is freaken cool.) I recently came upon this project
  of hers and fell in love. I love graffiti (and hate it because I'm not fast enough
  to be able to do  it myself), but I'm against harming the environment with all those
  spray can fumes...Edina Tokodi is THE solution. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see more,
