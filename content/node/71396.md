  body: "Kabel has a pre-digital history, but I couln't find a closer sample.\r\nIf
    it wasn't for the Futura-like M I'd go for a heavy weight of Avenir.\r\nMaybe
    really a mix if the sample is really mid-60s.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "I've managed to identify the other two fonts on the button (Alternate Gothic

    I've seen that \"G\" before..\r\n\r\nHere's the whole button with three others

    be replicas, but the design is authentic. I've seen an original at a museum."
