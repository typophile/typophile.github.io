body: "New to Typophile community just wanted to share some a new personal project
  on here. \r\nJust got on here but wanted to share a personal project of mine with
  the concept of the visualization of sound and typography. I decided to create the
  first 23 seconds of one of my favorite songs, \"Stronger\" a combination of two
  of my favorite artists Kanye West and Daft Punk. Using the web as its original digital
  medium, it is made so the user would need to scroll down to reveal the full piece
  sequentially much as a song is revealed to you on a timeline.  [[http://img.curioos.com/Content/Files/3cd6308e-444b-4aef-aad0-9ee800142aae/Artworks/0a161d9e-5ca0-4051-8b4b-9f5700951f09/0a161d9e-5ca0-4051-8b4b-9f5700951f09_ArtworkPageL.jpg?070920110902|Check
