  with Zapfino for client. The brand is 'Round the Bend Farm. I was thinking Engravers
  Gothic but I need more choices and I know you guys can help out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  all,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz\r\n\r\nps... NO OPTIMA!!! I'll fall asleep if I have to use
  it! :-)"

    it's really horrid!)\r\n\r\nC'mon, there are lots of interesting faces (sans or
    serif) that go with Zapfino: apart from things like Eras, Flora, Baker Signet,
    Albertus, Friz Quadrata, and American Uncial, what about Lucida Sans or Myriad?"

    \"flat\", wouldn't you? Like DIN or something.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Stephan> \r\n\r\nOn our lovely pacific coast we use the term farm to mean
    a place where crops are grown and such. \r\nIn the hot n' muggy east they use
    the word farm to mean a place where horses are trained and cared for.\r\n\r\nSo
    east coast = farm\r\nWest coast = ranch\r\n\r\nSo I'm doing work a for equine
    ranch. My client has very romantic tastes. So that's why I chose Zapfino. And
    to be more precise- Zapfino Forte. \r\nSome of the suggestions are pretty good
    but more would be nice....\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\nPS... I'm also doing work for
    another 'farm'- Saddle Ridge Farm."

    I know!\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/28357 _\r\nAnd since it's brand-spanking-new,
    you'd have a sort of exclusivity.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I'm no expert on pairing typefaces, but I second Hrant's recommendation of
    Beorcana. Not only would it go nicely with Zapfino, but in my mind it seems very
    appropriate for your design for this ranch/farm.
