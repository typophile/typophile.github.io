  hunger for new typefaces I struggle to find decency among those that are free. Until
  I can actually afford to spend some moolah, I have to resort to free fonts. Now
  my question for all is, where do you Typophiles suggest I go to find some decent
  fonts. I'm looking for all kinds, but I would like to put some emphasis on my need
  for body text typefaces. But as I said, I'm interested in all kinds. So please,
  can someone help me? I'm interested to know where others go to feed their hunger..\r\n\r\nThanks"

    As they may design and sell fonts, the availablity of freebies irks them.\r\n\r\nToo...
    to be honest, freebies tend to be other than really good. I got into designing
    my own because I, too, am an impecunious designer and too many of the many fonts
    that I have aquired over the years are not good enough to be used.\r\n\r\nI can
    recommend LIDO STF (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lido-stf/)and GENTIUM (http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium).
    Both are professional, high quality Roman Serifed fonts. Aside from these, FREE
    FONTS are about the easiest things to find on the net. There must be thousands.
    \r\n\r\ndo you google?\r\n\r\ngeo."

  body: 'If you need free fonts for student use, poke around on the various foundry
    web sites, many of them post great free fonts. Some foundries even rotate the
    free fonts, which makes it easy to build up a nice (albeit limited) collection
    for student work. '

  body: Talk with your professors if you find a font you really want to use in a project.
    Trust me, these universities have some bank set aside for things like this. They
    can purchase multiple user versions of the font and therefore enabling you to
    use it. I would try this if you are serious about a few fonts.

    FAQ section: free fonts. Of these, I recommend, as the most refined and stylish
    for display faces, Nick Curtis' free fonts at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/a.htm\r\n\r\nStorm
    Foundry offers a somewhat condensed version of Times Roman, four fonts for free.\r\n\r\nAnd
    go to MyFonts for free Larabie fonts; use the search to find others. MyFonts also
    has lots of sales.\r\n\r\nQuantity is easy to find, but not quality.\r\n\r\nAnd
    see if your school has fonts already acquired, ready to use."

  body: If you want to go to the trouble of making your own font, you can use a free
    tool like <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a> to do it.
    Chances are you wouldn't want to use your first efforts in a design project, but
    getting dirty with the sort of effort it takes to produce a font might give you
    some appreciation of why some fonts are worth as much as they cost. Who knows?
    Maybe you'll find you have a knack for it.

    fonts on that site are *not* freeware. Several of them have restrictions. Be sure
    to read the fine type.\r\n\r\nAs a .gover, I've had to scourge the internet to
    get a handful of decent free faces. I should compile the list one of these days...\r\n"
