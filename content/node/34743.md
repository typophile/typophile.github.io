  where Jared Benson offered his expertise on the subject. Looking at the case studies,
  and with the iPhone being introduced this week...it had me thinking... \r\n\r\nWhat
  will the future of typography on cell phones and handheld devices be like?\r\n\r\nAre
  higher resolution handheld displays changing how people think about designing type
  for these devices?\r\n\r\n(* Note: Please do not use this thread as an excuse to
  rant about how much you may hate the iPhone.)"

    3 types of instances where it will show up (which loosely defines the players
    responsible):\r\n\r\n1- Mobile phone UI. The UI that's built into the handset
    (as with Punchcut's Qualcomm Sans in the article you mentioned). // Falls to the
    manufacturers and carriers.\r\n\r\n2- Mobile web sites (like what you will see
    when using a mobile browser (Opera and Opera Mini, IE for Windows Mobile, Safari
    Mobile Version, etc., etc., etc., The list is long, tedious and the results ugly.)
    // Falls to the web site and content owners.\r\n\r\n3- Fonts embedded into \"after
    market\" games, applications, themes, and content (like e-books). // Falls to
    the app developers and sometimes affected by the carriers who certify them."

  body: "I fear it will develop in parallel to the overall gist of electronic gadgets:
    bells and whistles, instead of real functionality. I really don't want to be negative
    about this, and I'm prepared to be proven wrong (and even take part in a future
    where I'm proven wrong) but almost everything I've seen is way too concerned with
    \"image\", and not concerned enough with really helping users. A couple of weeks
    ago I had an encounter with Patricia Roller (founder and former CEO of Frog Design)
    and she seems to share this disillusionment. She actually got visibly angry at
    somebody who was praising the supposed \"power\" of his Treo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\"Image\" isn't necessarily a bad thing. Saying that image isn't an important
    part of user experience just doesn't make sense. The bigger problem, as I've seen
    it, is that device manufacturers/purchasers don't understand the value of typography
    in creating \"image\". As an industry the device makers are still a little engineering
    focused, as opposed to experience focused. Making type look good can be expensive
    from a processor/memory standpoint, not to mention from a development/design standpoint.
    The iPhone will raise the bar in this category, whether it's successful or not.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the power of the Treo: it's the only mass market phone that I know of where
    a user can write and compile software without having to sign up for a crazy developer
    program that requires each application to be signed by the phone manufacturer
    and lots of money (I'm not sure if windows mobile requires signatures, but I'm
    pretty sure that windows mobile devs can't use free compilers - only pros with
    $$$ can play). A good example of why this is powerful: how many phones have a
    great pixel font editor? Only the Treo, as far as I know. In the bitmap font editor
    category, my years old treo is light years ahead of the iPhone with its closed
    platform. I know that hackability doesn't always equate to user-friendliness,
    but user-friendliness is not the same as power."

  body: "What good is pixel font editor if the device is high res and uses ClearType
    like technology? It was probably more important years back with monochrome displays.
    All future handhelds (we'll see how long we'll have to wait) will use technologies
    like ClearType, which means that fonts will be vectors there too. No need for
    pixel editors. Processor power is doubling every 18 months, memory prices are
    falling down, so doors are opening here too. iPhone BTW doesn't use the highest
    res of all the handhelds I know about. AFAIK there's a much better display around
    on an iPaq. (coincidentally named with starting i?)\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem
    that I see here is the size of the display. Handhelds may become smaller and have
    higher resolution displays and being able to display FIRST CLASS type but that
    will definitely restrain our eyes. So the biggest advancement will still be in
    displays not technology behind them. How to pack a bigger display in a device
    of a smaller size? Or even don't pack it but project the image in space/surface
    somehow.\r\n\r\nAnd BTW: you can develop .Net solutions for mobile devices running
    Windows Mobile OS. No $$$ included... There's a special .Net Compact Framework
    that serves the purpose."

  body: "eInk, ePaper or whatever you call it. No matter how they name it I don't
    think this will be the course of the future for displaying things, because this
    will limit the usage of devices. And I don't think that eInk in any way shape
    or form will be of any usable form and packed into a really useful device in the
    next at least 5 years. Because processor power will be in the time of the technology
    so much higher, there will be completely other  possibilities of interaction.
    Processor will be able to handle them. eInk as a ready technology will probably
    be a decade too late on the market to really spread.\r\n\r\nWhen it finally comes
    out its lifespan won't be as it is with nowadays LCDs. They're here to stay with
    the interaction technology for as long as we will interact with computers the
    way we do. Even interaction changes may not change them. Take for instance Microsoft's
    Surface (which is BTW just an exploitation of the first step done just now by
    the iPhone)\r\n\r\nDisplays will definitely \"go off\" devices. I wondered who
    ever used UMTS for practical reasons and not just because it's so fancy to talk
    and see the other party? It's not intuitive, it's not how we think communication
    works. Not with a mobile device. This will change."

    hoping for a font management program to be included in a cell phone sometime in
    the future. And a flying car. :)\r\n\r\nAs far as E-Ink goes, I think it will
    be used for larger displays than small handheld devices. Specifically signage
    (since it will eventually be more cost effective than LCD displays). There will
    always be a need for updating information quickly in a large environment."

    should probably write: market successful device that has obvious advantage over
    competing products without ePaper.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that CLIE is just another
    handheld device. The use of eInk/ePaper doesn't really need to be there. It could
    be done like all the rest. ePaper will be great in applications as mentioned later:
    newspapers, public places... And hopefully small devices that would be able to
    have larger display as the dimension of device itself. That's where ePaper comes
    in and replaces LEDs (TFTs, OLEDs, whatever).\r\n\r\nAlso consider the development
    of LEDs. The biggest difference between ePaper and LEDs is the light source. If
    they manage to make a durable flexible LED display that integrates back light
    and doesn't consume too much energy, believe me, ePaper WILL BE DEAD. Light and
    energy are main advantages. If they don't make the resolution of it at least 2x
    it's bound to fail.\r\n\r\nAs I can see we are still talking the same things here."
