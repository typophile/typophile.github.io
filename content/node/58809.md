body: "I\xB4m looking for sugestions for this monogram i\xB4m designing. It\xB4s function
  is to work as personal logo. The initials are R & C (Ricardo Calaba\xE7a). After
  trying with a few concepts, I came up with this version, which is the one I fell
  more comfortable with. The typeface is Esta Display, designed by Dino dos Santos
  (DSType).\r\n\r\nCommnents anyone?\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n"

  body: "It's kind of bland for my tastes.  But if your going for an understated elegance
    type of feel you've got it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a special reason for the double
    R's? (I mean other than that it looks cool)\r\nYou could actually do double C's
    as well since its in your name:\r\n<strong>R</strong>i<strong>c</strong>a<strong>r</strong>do
    <strong>C</strong>alaba\xE7a\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rc2_6049.png]"

    it\xB4s because I\xB4m left handed, and the other reason was because of all the
    other designs looked unbalanced. I\xB4m ok with your version, but it feels a little
    bit too much for me. I like the other version better. "

  body: "I like the revision and that both letters are mirrored. \r\n\r\nThe stroke
    and white frame (geometric and mono stroke) are not well-related to the letterforms
    (thick-thin variations with nuanced serifs). An easy solution would be to just
    get rid of the black stroke. Try just the letters on a black circle. The monogram
    is a very traditional and the clean circle would add a modern touch. \r\n\r\n"

    it. It lacks personality in my opinion.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monogram_new_6254.png]"

    & professionalism, so this was what I came up with. Also my last name is Calaba\xE7a
    (derived from Calabazaz) and from what I\xB4ve found, it\xB4s origins go all the
    way back to the year of 1600!"

    it's closer (and maybe even connected) to the R?\r\nJust an idea."

    shapes. I\xB4m open to suggestions!!!\r\n\r\nThanks "
