  uploaded images: masthead/nameplate of Der Sturm magazine and a sample first page
  with some text (I can upload a better quality sample, because this one may be too
  small). \r\n\r\nI am writing a paper about avant-garde publications and cannot find
  a perfect match for the typefaces used - the masthead and text typeface is a priority
  right now. It could be a recut of a more commonly used typeface ... anyways I would
  really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nKatja"

  body: "At first glance it seems very close. Since the font design is pre-20th century,
    there is a high possibility it was DeVinne or a variation of it.\r\n\r\nUpdate:
    after researching a bit, I am even more conviced it is De Vinne, since Gustav
    Schroeder was born in Berlin (even though he worked in the USA while designing
    De Vinne), where Der Sturm was published, and the typeface was really popular
    at the end of the 19th century, which was \"the look\" Der Sturm was going for
    at the beggining of its' publication in 1910 (a regular newspaper, rather than
    a \"glossy\" art magazine).\r\n\r\nThank you very much, Ryuk."
