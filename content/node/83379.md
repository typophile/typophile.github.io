body: I am hoping to publish a book of my poetry soon. I have decided that the poetry
  will be written in Adobe Caslon, but I'm not sure what the titling font should be.
  I really want something serif.

  body: "What kind of poetry?\r\n\r\nSerif-serif paring means you either take the
    same family, or something very different, definitely not from the same time or
    style. \r\n\r\nWhich means if you take an English old-style like Caslon, you combine
    it either with another Caslon typeface for display size, but other baroque and
    renaissance fonts are out. \r\n\r\nHow about something completely different, without
    it being a sans? Like Fakir? I as well like the hand-drawn feeling of the outlines
    of Arepo.\r\n\r\n"
