  body: "Original name should be <strong>Tasmin Bold</strong>. It should appear on
    Dan X Solo 1979 collection \"Sans Serif Display Alphabets\" (p. 96).\r\nI know
    there's a freebie floating around but can't say about its legitimacy. Note it
    also carries the other /S (not the one of your sample).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tasminbold_5551.jpg]"

    of fonts from a number of sources  - do not know how they got this one.

  body: "There is also Tasmin by David Crosby. I don't know who copied whom.\r\nPrevious
    discussion http://typophile.com/node/107791\r\n\r\nI have no info on the origin
    of the pre-digital font, other than that Dan X. Solo gave the name of Tasmin to
    this design, which he may have purchased as metal type.\r\n\r\nThis Art Nouveau
    design is a variation on Quaint by the Dickinson Type Foundry of Boston. Aka Desdemona
    by Karl Brendler & S\xF6hne of Vienna. \r\nDesdemona http://luc.devroye.org/KarlBrendler+Soehne-Desdemona.jpg
    Both are circa 1900. I don't know which came first. Several good digital versions.\r\nDon"
