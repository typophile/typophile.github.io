<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I know this has been brought up before with some response, but it never seems to go anywhere. So I'll ask again ;o) <br> <br>Is there anything we can do to fix the fact that if one posts a wide image it completely messes up the entire layout of the thread with extremely-wide-impossible-to-read line lengths? <br> <br>It seems the easy solution would be to wrap each comment in it's own table and/or div instead of putting them all in one containing table. <br> <br>Just a thought. It'd sure make reading some threads a lot easier.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The short answer is, <br>it's on our to-do list. <br>(We gladly welcome <br>volunteers.) <br> <br>In the meantime, all <br>you have to do is <br>manually wrap your <br>own when you write <br>a post. <br> <br>It takes a bit more <br>care, but it's worth <br>the effort.</div>

<div class=commentbody>the problem with wrapping manually is that it produces clumsy markup/content stored in the database. Not a huge deal, but it's something to consider. Plus, it's more work for the people posting, not to mention that everyone has their own preferred line-lenght ;o) <br> <br>As for volunteers, send the templates my way.

<div class=commentbody>Aargh! What's happened to Typophile? Someone has been playing with the style sheet, and suddenly the message type is 6pt, half my screen is wasted, things are colliding, it's a mess. <br> <br>Guys, fixed pixel type sizes = Really Bad Thing. Those of us with 133+ dpi screens will go blind with this tiny type. <br> <br>Sure the line length thing was was annoying, but the way to fix that is to specify text blocks as divs with widths in ems. <br> <br>It is 6:00 here in Vancouver, and the General Discussion list looks like this (if your resolution is less than 133 dpi, imagine that this graphic is only 5.75 inches wide and the type correspondingly small; the type in threads is about 2pts smaller): <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19500.gif alt="Typophile at 18:00 hours"></div>

<div class=commentbody>So, you'd think CSS was a science. It is when you're dealing with HTML. This forum uses it's own (proprietary) code and so it's trial and error... <br> <br>Anyway, the current style sheet is Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif at 12pixels (not 12points). The page width is set at 780 pixels. If people post big graphics IE will still maintain the page width, but Safari doesn't. What do you think? John, do you still have to use a magnifying glass?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, here's the maths: <br> <br>point size = (pixel size / resolution) x 72 <br> <br>So 12 pixel type at 72 dpi approximates 12pt type. 12 pixel type at the old typical Windows standard of 96 dpi is approximately 9 pt type. <br> <br>On my 133 dpi screen, 12 pixel type is about 6.5 pt. On the popular new Del laptops with 145 dpi screens, it is a little smaller than 6 pt. <br> <br>On the IBM 200 dpi screens (now down to $7,500 US! -- when I started paying attention they were $22,000), 12 pixel type is 4.3 pt. <br> <br>Now what does this tell you about the wisdom of using a non-fixed unit to specify fixed sizes of specify type?</div>

<div class=commentbody>"The page width is set at 780 pixels. If people post big graphics IE will still maintain the page width, but Safari doesn't. What do you think?" <br> <br>I think that's simply too wide for comfortable reading lengths for a lot of people. Plus, I normally browser with my window at roughtly 5/600 pixels wide. I think the problem is how the template is spit out. <br> <br>The code is also INCREDIBLY messy, redundant and bloated with all sorts of font tags and such. On this page, I see 16 closing font tags in a row (yikes!): <br> <br>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&lt;/font> <br> <br>The problem is that the entire thread is in one table that is nested in another table. Each comment in the thread is a TR of the parent, so whatever the parent table's width is, each comment will be that width. <br> <br>If you want to stick with tables, the fix (I think) is to get rid of the wrapper table and then allow each comment in the thread be it's own table, with a percentage width. <br> <br>This isn't an uncommon problem with these types of forums that were built in the hey-day of 'let's do everything with a ton of tables' and it's really only a problem here due to the fact that we post rather large images. <br> <br>"Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif at 12pixels (not 12points)." <br> <br>A typographic site spec'ing Arial?

<div class=commentbody>200 DPI and 4 POINT TEXT <br>John, are you suggesting that the problem could be fixed by <br>specifying points rather than pixels in the style sheet? <br> <br>In my experience, pixels render truer across platforms than <br>points (given the Windows 96dpi and Mac at 72dpi). I can't <br>explain the math, but in testing many sites, they look more <br>consistent across platforms by speccing pixels. I will <br>concede that the testing I've done has always involved <br>common laptop and CRT screens. (I wish I had the problems <br>associated with a $7,500 screen.) <br> <br>NOT A VERDANA FAN? <br>Not <i>always</i> a Verdana fan, no. Verdana is brilliant at 9 to <br>11 point, aliased. It also maintains bold at 9 and 10 pt <br>(Helvetica/Arial at 10 pt on the Mac do not). However when <br>the new OSs anti-alias all the text, and when text must be <br>larger, especially at 14 or 16 point, it's clunky. (And I don't <br>think I'm blaspheming when I suggest it doesn't perform <br>optimally at larger sizes.) Aside from that, we know a great type <br>blog that uses Verdana and we wanted to differentiate <br>ourselves. ;-) <br> <br>MESSY CODE <br>Darrel, you're right. The messy code and the lack of control <br>(over line widths, layout, et cetera) is the danger of using a <br>canned product instead of building something from scratch. <br>I'm sure what you're pointing out contributes to slowness <br>that some people notice. We've looked at other discussion <br>forum software (which is not the same as blog software). <br> <br>The danger of moving to another discussion platform is that <br>we potentially lose convenient access to the past 2 years of <br>content generated by this community. Although we certainly <br>haven't ruled that out. (If we installed new forum software we'd <br>certainly make the old one available to search and read.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joseph, spec'ing type in pts or another resolution-independent measure is certainly the best idea. Yes, the results are going to vary across platforms, but they are not going to vary as greatly as fixed size pixel type across different resolutions. Personally, I think type size should not be spec'd at all, except as relative to body type, but should be determined by the user-side preferences, and all other measurements, e.g. text block width, should be spec'd in ems so that these too are relative to the body type. That way you have perfectly scaleable web pages. <br> <br>Above, Darrel says that he thinks 780 pixels is 'simply too wide for comfortable reading lengths for a lot of people', but this observation is itself based on the assumption that the type is spec'd in pixels. If the type were spec'd in pts, then the number of words a on 780 pixel measure would depend on the resolution: it would probably be a bit narrow for comfort on my screen. But if the type were spec'd as pts and the measure spec'd in ems, then the number of words on a line would be the same regardless of the resolution.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Let me rephrase...780 pixels is just too wide for my browser regardless of the line length. <br> <br>Max-width won't remedy the current situation, which is images that are too wide that push the table to a certain width. Since every comment in the thread is part of the same table, they all inherit the widest post. (Plus, max-width doesn't work in IE/PC or Safari/Mac...*sigh*).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Earlier I said that excessive use of Verdana, at large sizes is <br>clunky. Well, here's a good example with Verdana Bold at <br>size 'x-large.'

<div class=commentbody>I don't know, Joseph. <br>It looks fine here (1024x768). <br> <br>BTW, I too prefer Verdana. At least for me, the <br>forums are harder to read with Arial. It looks too <br>narrow and tight. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>On my end, the Typophile Forums are notably worse now in terms of typography. <br>I can tangibly feel the stutters I've been making since the "redesign". Please put it back! :-) <br> <br>And I don't get this anti-Verdana business - it's so much better than Arial for this type of thing it's not even funny. <br> <br>Is there a platform difference perhaps? <br>Like for me <a href=http://www.designobserver.com/ target=_blank>http://www.designobserver.com/</a> looks great, on both browsers. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Joe and Jared, <br> <br>Do you use the optional MySQL back end? If so, it wouldn't be hard to write a different application using the same data as the Discus app. If you don't use MySQL, it would still be interesting to see how they store the data. It may not be too hard to migrate it to a database. <br> <br>I may be able to donate some time into writing a different system using the same data (right now I'm "self employed", to I have some time). Sometimes it's easier to rewrite something from scratch than trying to adapt someone elses clunky code to your needs. (The LettError guys have some inspiring <a href=http://letterror.com/code/coding.html>ideas</a> about this) <br> <br>If nothing else, I could rewrite the typophile map. I've been bitter ever since it put me in Idaho.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Christian, let's talk. No, we're not currently running MySQL, but we're strongly considering it when we switch ISPs soon. It should speed things up. <br> <br>______ <br>In the meantime, peeps, download the free <i><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_download" target=_blank>Gentium</a></i> and we'll see how this looks. Give Gentium a bold and some heavier distribution and it'd be a great system font alternative to Georgia, Times, Serif. (Don't ask me if I don't like Georgia. I dig Georgia in every way.) <br> <br>Oh, and turn on Clarendon if it doesn't auto activate (we know you have Clarendon) and see what you think of the <a href=http://typophile.com/books/>books</a> section. <br> <br>______ <br>In the meantime, peeps, download the free <i><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_download" target=_blank>Gentium</a></i> and we'll see how this looks.

<div class=commentbody>Darrel, <br> <br>If you browse the article I linked, you'd see that you could implement a max-width solution by applying it to the &lt;p> element. Even if an image is larger in width you could limit the width of a paragaph element's contents. <br> <br>Svend's article explains how to make it work in IE/PC. I don't know about Safari however. <br> <br>Of course this assumes that paragraphs are actually marked up with &lt;p> tags in the posts -- which they're not. Maybe one day web standards will actually be <i>the</i> standard.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tim: <br> <br>Yea, in theory that could work. But it'e be much easier just to kill the nested table template and apply the width attribute to individual comment wrappers (whether that remains a table or becomes a DIV/SPAN). <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Darrel, <br> <br>Of course -- I agree. I would love to see the Typophile forums make the leap to full CSS. The benefits are too numerous to discuss here, but you know it's true. <i>If</i> I have time, I'd be willing to give a hand.</div>
