  use both? Just curious, looking into both right now.

  body: 'They are very different tools. UFOStretch is for modifying subsets of characters
    by scaling and interpolating on a single axis. It is useful for tasks like creating
    small caps and figures.  Superpolator is a multi-axis interpolation tool that''s
    mostly useful for interpolating and extrapolating entire fonts from an arbitrary
    number of master fonts. '
