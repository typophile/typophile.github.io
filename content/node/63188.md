  can I adjust the preview size so I can see the whole character in Fontlab?"

  body: They seem awfully high. You may want to move them down. Otherwise, you could
    change your vertical metrics by moving the ascender up to include the accents.
    Right now, it looks like they are higher than the ascender line.

  body: 'I agree with Mark. When FontLab creates the composites for you, it always
    places them too high. There is no shame in referencing other designs to look for
    clues, like offsets of diacritics. '

  body: "That is exactly the problem I'm having of late.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, ALL of the
    files I open do this, where the characters are suddenly too big and all the diacritics
    get cut off.\r\n\r\nIf I dump the pref file (Fontlab 5.0.4, OS X 10.5.7 and now
    10.5.8) com.fontlab.fontlab5.plist the first time I open a file it'll usually
    be fine, then I open another and that new one is back to too large, and every
    other file opened after that is also broken the same way. Even happens to system
    fonts I've never touched before. The edit screen for each glyph is too large as
    well, over magnified compared to where it should be regularly.\r\n\r\nShould look
    like this (and does originally):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex01_5522.jpg]\r\n\r\nThen
    all become like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex02_5355.jpg]\r\n\r\nUpdate:
    \r\n\r\nTurns out, in trying to get a good description of what is happening to
    compare, it is a specific one of my files - somehow corrupted and causes this
    problem when I open it. It then cascades to all other files until I dump the prefs
    again. I copied out my glyphs to an older version of the file and everything works,
    no problems (so far), and all other files continue to display correctly.\r\n\r\nSo
    if these grabs above look like your problem, try dumping the prefs, and then copying
    to a new or older version and see if that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcs"

    guideline in GW, right-click it and select Guideline is > Visual ascender.
