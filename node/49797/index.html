  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Daunting is the task of self publishing, writing a 90,000 page book titled Nature&rsquo;s Ancient Religion (Orisha worship &amp; IFA) was I am finding the easy part. Next, came the editing phase and that was slow, painstaking, but fruitful. I chose a professional service and was pleased with the result. Therefore, it was time to weed through the maze of demand publishers some call self publishers. This was full of pitfalls and cons. I also talked with the University Press industry, private printers, and my pal Shepard Swift who owns Moonlight Press. I had almost decided on Lulu but hated the limited options of font and paper when I stumbled upon Create Space. Create Space is an Amazon company so at least Amazon was covered (in the US). The royalties were more generous than Lulu and the big news was I could use any font in my PDF file!</p>
<pre><code> By this time I was onto the professional formatters and I choose Accenture in Bloomington, Indiana as I assumed there was some hook up with the University of Indiana that has a strong University Press. The problem was I had specified using the Lulu styles choosing Verdana for the body and Garamond for the quotes in a 12 point font size. I was not happy with the lack of choices and choose these because I wanted a larger easier to read type. Perhaps it is because I am 50 and fighting using reading glasses, but I really strain with say a small normal sized trade paperback. I love to read and so I choose the larger type not gigantic. About this time I added 25 chapter illustrations that take up about 1/3 of the top of my 6 X 9 book. (Illustration below) 
</code></pre>
<p>The formatting had three rounds of edits and I kept packing things in and changing things. These expired and I had already added another payment when I stumbled on Create Space. Well you can imagine that now I was and am really stumped. Sure it will cost me again reformatting but now I have a lot of options open to me. One thing I noticed as I began to learn about type was that I should use a third and maybe fourth typestyle for Chapter titles and headers. I am using the written out Chapter on left pages and the name of the chapter on right pages.  Well where I am now is looking again at the fonts.  I do know that I want a larger one for the body of the book probably in 12 point and I like Lucinda Sans Unicode.  I know that this is larger than the Verdana and so of course that would change my page count and clearly I would have to re index my index. I have an eight page glossary, a six page index and a rather unique section called Building Your Library. I came up with this idea because my book is targeting those outside the religion or those new to it. I find little use with a standard bibliography and a recommended reading list is better, but still not enough. My Building Your Library section is 22 meaty pages critiquing my fellow authors and listing the offerings in both the African branch of the religious tree and the Latin branches.</p>
<p>If any of the resident aficionados are still with me I would greatly appreciate  your sage advice. I am looking for types for the body (as I mentioned I do like the Lucinda Sans Unicode, but am not married to it). I also need a type in contrast for quotes in the body (of course I could use italics), I need a size and font for the chapter titles and finally a choice for the chapter headers. Any suggestions or discussions will be most appreciated. Thank you all for your valuable time.</p>
