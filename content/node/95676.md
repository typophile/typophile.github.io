  from this tutorial:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/atypi_Adventures_in_class_kerning.pdf\r\n\r\nI
  defined a few classes and pairs. ([[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46459223/fontlab_bug.png|See
  my code.]]) but nothing happened - they weren't applied. The only message I get
  is:\r\n\r\n[WARNING] <FLSFNT8733> Glyph class @FLSFNT8733 redefined [C:/Users/boris/Documents/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea
  3] \r\n\r\nAs i saif, my font compiles correcty, bu the pairs aren't applied. Help."

    (e.g. _a).\"\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\"Each kerning class and each metrics class must
    have exactly one key glyph defined \u2013this is done by following one of the
    glyph names in the glyph definition by the quotesingle (') character. The key
    glyph acts as a \u201Crepresentative\u201D of the class.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.ch/downloads/manuals/FLS5WinManual.zip\r\n\r\nPS
    If you use a .fea file/format, it should be something like this:\r\n\r\n@_a =
    [ a  aacute ];\r\n\r\nNB the double space after the \"a\"."
