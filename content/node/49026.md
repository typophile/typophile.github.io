  bookstores, but rather: followed a link in an ad-e-mail from Amazon I found the
  book ABC3D by Marion Bataille (no telling if she''s related to the late great Georges).
  If you don''t enjoy pop-up books you''re heartless. Follow this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/m3DNVC4GL17O4J">link</a>
  to watch the video. Enjoy!'
