    on the 'd' and 'i' have thrown me a little. \r\n\r\nThanks for your quick response
    - I will keep searching!\r\n\r\nD"

  body: "I think the idea of obliquing the Roman 's' is a key. If you do that with
    a heavy weight of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-century/|ITC Century]]
    (or adding stroke thickness might be even better), and use the Italic for the
    rest of the letters I think it's very similar. Century has the flat top serifs
    you need. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Here is a sample made with ITC Century Bold Italic with 1.5 pt of thickness
    added to the stroke. The 's' is the Roman that has been slanted 10 degrees. I
    tried this with Georgia and the 'i' has a rounded serif -- not a good match.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I can see when I compare my sample and the original that ITC Century isn't
    the best match (the d counter shape is wrong), but the idea seems promising as
    a way to create something nearly the same. That was my first approximation. There
    is undoubtedly a better font to match the posted sample, but I doubt it was made
    from a font right 'out of the box'. I think some manipulations were used.\r\n\r\n-
