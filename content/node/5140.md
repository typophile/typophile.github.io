body: Where can I put characters with no Unicode assignments?  I&#39;ve got a character
  from an old Chinese romanization system that appears in both upper and lower case
  &#40;I&#39;m fairly certain it has no assignment, could be wrong though&#41;.

  body: Chris,  <BR> <BR>there aren&#39;t any. Normally, French, Spanish, Polish or
    Czech oblique mark placed above letters is all encoded as &#34;acute&#34;. A font
    designer should decide whether he designs an acute that will be a compromise between
    the needs of Spanish, French, Czech and Polish typography &#40;e.g. Palatino Linotype&#41;,
    or he will supply a default acute form suitable for languages such as Spanish
    or Czech &#40;usually a bit flatter&#41;, and a stylistic alternate suitable for
    Polish, accessible through OpenType Layout features &#40;locl, salt&#41;. Regardless
    of the solution within the font, the letters are always encoded using the same
    Unicode values.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>

  body: 'Let me delve deeper for the sake of anyone who may find that they&#39;ve
    wandered into a similar predicament... <BR> <BR>Browsing the codepages in FontLab,
    you&#39;ll notice that several are labeled &#34;Unassigned zone&#34;, you might
    be tempted at first &#40;as I was&#41; to use the codepoints in these pages--but
    I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re not supposed to.  Here&#39;s why:  Those spots
    are reserved for future assignments; you might design a font, give it a range
    in an unassigned zone, and then 9 months later the consortium assigns those very
    codepoints to, say, Klingon &#40;which sounds like a joke, but someone actually
    proposed it [and it got turned down]&#41;. <BR> <BR>The Private Use Area is pretty
    big, so there shouldn&#39;t be a lack of space. <BR> <BR>I just wish there was
    some other way to access the characters outside of the first 255 range; there&#39;s
    just something nice about getting to a character with the keyboard.'

  body: I&#39;ve heard about Klingon getting turned down, but was there ever any final
    decision on Tengwar? How would one find out the status of such proposals? Oh and
    back on topic... you can create your own keyboard layout &#40;i believe&#41; with
    Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2900"
    target="_blank"> Keyboard Layout Creator</a>. I haven&#39;t tried it before, but
    lemme know how it works! <BR>Oh, and i&#39;m guessing that&#39;ll only work for
    windows. I dunno if there&#39;s anything similar for mac, I&#39;m sure someone
    else in here would know that tho. <BR> <BR>

    do you mean by that Adam? Are multiple glyphs able to be mapped to the same unicode
    values? Or did i misunderstand what you meant?

  body: I got excited about Keyboard Layout Creator when I first heard about it, then
    I realized it doesn&#39;t work in Windows ME.  I&#39;d like to try it out, but
    I&#39;m not ready to do Windows XP yet. <BR> <BR>Hey, does Windows Character Map
    only display the first 255 glyphs?  Or is there some way I can select characters
    residing in the &#34;grey&#34; area with it too?  The only program I have that
    lets me see and select these glyphs is Word &#40;by selecting &#39;insert&#39;
    &#62; &#39;symbol&#39;&#41;.  Should I be able to do the same in WordPerfect?  &#40;Because
    I&#39;ve tried and I can&#39;t.&#41;

    obscure and idiosyncratic, Chinese romanization characters are likely to be encoded
    already. If not, they are candidates for encoding and should be documented.

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the two characters are named, John.  I was going to
    post a scan shortly in hopes that someone could identify them.  I know what they&#39;re
    used for, of course--in the name &#34;Lao Tze&#34; the character in question replaces
    the &#34;t&#34;.  In the uppercase it resembles a stylized &#34;3&#34;, in the
    lowercase it looks very similar to a lowercase cursive &#34;z&#34;.

  body: So then is the consensus that there is no way to use both the Polish and the
    romance languages in the same font without the InDesign Glyph pallette?  That
    doesn&#39;t seem fair.  In this opentype world there should be a place for a Kreska.

  body: Aww, Thomas, I got so excited when I thought yogh was it.  It is, unfortunately,
    not the one. <BR> <BR>John and Thomas, let me give you a little background on
    the characters.  As far as I can tell, the characters may have been devised specifically
    for a series of books &#40;translations of some asian religious and philosophical
    texts&#41;, entitled the &#34;Sacred Books of the East&#34; series, initiated
    by F. Max M&uuml;ller.  The entire romanization system used in the series is way
    off by today&#39;s standards &#40;pre Wade-Giles, Pinyin, etc.&#41;.  The system
    uses only one non-Latin character--this one... <BR> <BR>&#40;All apologies for
    the bitmap image and its poor quality, I&#39;m working with reverse engineering;
    the images came directly from one of the texts which was magnified several times
    then polished enough for scanning and subsequent vectorization.  The outlines
    in my font-in-progress are significantly cleaner, but of course you&#39;ll see
    those images much much later.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/38061.jpg"

  body: You&#39;re right. The cap is close enough for argument, but the lowercase
    in particular is really not much like the yogh, with the tail curling back up
    and to the right. <BR> <BR>Dang. <BR> <BR>T

    codepoints--I&#39;d kind of like to try my hand at proposing and passing such
    a thing. <BR> <BR>Regardless, if any of you happen to run across information on
    these &#40;either in Unicode or elsewhere&#41;, let me know.  In the meantime
    I&#39;ll begin what is sure to be the tedious process of searching through the
    1400&#43; pages of the Unicode Standard.
