body: "I have been asked to do some minor edits to an older font I produced in FL
  5.0. I had to do these edits in FL 5.1 since my new operating system won't run the
  older FL 5.o. Trying to generate the font I now get \"languagesystem statements\"
  errors.\r\n\r\nIs there any way around this? Or do I now have to go into all the
  OT features and fix up all the language issues?\r\n\r\nThe old font works fine and
  I would really rather not go into all that detail for such a few minor edits."
