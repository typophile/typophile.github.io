  similar to this Greek font, GFS Solomos. Here's a sample, Romans 3:21-26 (the first
  word is in GFS Decker for small caps):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample

  but it's not quite right--the strokes are too thin and the letters are too narrow.
  The sample below compares similar glyphs, GFS Solomos on left, italic Garamond on
  right:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample II_4784.png]\r\n\r\nThanks

    If that's the case, a bit of online research should uncover what Latin typeface
    Solomos emulates. But Cyrillic would be another issue...\r\n\r\nI have a feeling
    you'd be better off finding another font in a similar style that has Latin, Cyrillic
    and Greek.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    century an italic font with many calligraphic overtones was introduced into Greek
    printing. Its source is unknown, but it almost certainly was the product of a
    German or Italian foundry. In the first type specimen printed in Greece by the
    typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font was listed anonymously along others of
    11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated specimen appeared as \xAB11pt Greek inclined\xBB.\""

  body: "I had always understood the GFS fonts to be based on historic <em>Greek</em>
    typefaces, not Latin ones. Less serious font sources will base their faces on
    popular Latin faces - thus I was startled at one point to see an Armenian version
    of Mistral. But why shouldn't Armenians get to have fun with display faces?\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the display of Solomos on the GFS website, the first thing that strikes me
    as an appropriate companion to it is Century Expanded. That is, however, anachronistic,
    and a Scotch Roman would indeed be a better match.\r\n\r\nFor Cyrillic, there's
    a free Scotch Roman, the typeface \"Old Standard\" by Aleksey Kryukov, but that
    face seems to be a bit heavier with more stroke contrast. However, when I took
    another look at a specimen, it doesn't seem to clash with Solomos as much as I
    feared, so it might be acceptable."

    are different kinds of fun. Some people think chess is fun. Others think Russian
    Roulette is fun. The thing with a font is that when you make one, you're potentially
    deeply affecting the parameters of your culture, long into the future. I've seen
    the Armenian Mistral: it's like an Armenian faking a French accent. Plus it doesn't
    have the proper paperwork.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Scotch Modern/Roman and Century Expanded compared to the free Old Standard? because
    at the same letter size the lines are too far apart compared to Solomos, not to
    mention this kind of font is too plain for my taste. (Perhaps I could ask a better
    question about what exactly I'm looking for? because I'm the furthest thing from
    a type expert)"

    Solomos has, and this is why I've been using italic Garamond for this project

    as the pointed nib, whereas Garamond is a broad nib style, a horse of a different
    color. Perhaps you just mean quaint, busy and irregular?

    body: That's probably right; the thing I like most about Solomos is how closely
      it's spaced vertically, which along with the eccentric curves make it an excellent
      choice for a font that is both compact and pleasing to the eyes (which is important
      given I'm using this font for running text, not just italic emphasis), but it's
      been a challenge to find a Latin or Cyrillic font with similar qualities

  body: GFS Decker has actually proven a great workaround to polytonic small caps--since
    it's an uncial font it has approximately the same effect while making a marked
    contrast to the curves of Solomos! but it's thinness suits it much better for
    Solomos than for Scotch. Do you suggest I should just use Scotch instead of Solomos?
