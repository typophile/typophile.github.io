  that has been printed by TYPEFOUNDRY\"AMSTERDAM\" and with layout by D. Dooijes
  (chief-designer of Typefoundry \"Amsterdam\").\r\nThe specimen is composed by 20
  pages (A4). Here are the introductory words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In this booklet we are
  happy to introduce the newest typeface of\r\nSjoerd H. de Roos, one of the world's
  most famous and successful\r\ntype designers. This veteran Dutch artist during his
  fifty year's career\r\nin the graphic arts has deeply influenced contemporary typography,\r\nnotably
  in Western Europe. He has created many new printing types\r\nwhich are now in use
  in all parts of the world. To mention a few:\r\nthe slender, graceful Egmont family,
  the sturdy and yet elegant Dutch\r\nMedieval. the refined and spiritual Erasmus,
  the highly original and\r\nstriking Libra and the interesting Simplex, the most
  experimental\r\ncontemporary design. The experience and the skill acquired in half\r\na
  century of work on the highest creative level has now produced a\r\nnew type family
  of outstanding qualities: De Roos Roman & Italic.\r\nType experts in every country
  have expressed already their admiration\r\nfor this noble design, which in its quiet,
  beautifully balanced\r\nforms shows an exquisite grace and charm.\r\nWe are now
  able to present the full range of sizes of the Roman,\r\nthe Italic and a series
  of Inline Initials, to which a Semi-bold will be\r\nadded soon. We do so in the
  full confidence of making available a\r\nbeautiful and perfectly readable type of
  lasting merit.\"\r\n\r\nSome samples below (lowres). If anyone needs something more
  let me know :)\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos6_5303.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos5_3494.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos4_4094.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos3_6074.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos1_4007.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos2_6318.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roos3_6502.jpg]"
