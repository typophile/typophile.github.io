  longer at this company , and did not leave behind any documentation, I would most
  appreciate Your expert input on the matter, as I need to add a couple of buttons
  and they need to match the current ones used with this font.  Thank You for Your
  assistance!! and All have a Great time off during these Holidays, and please stay
  safe!!! Sincerely, Miguel. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/operational_on_5957.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/operational_off_6491.jpg]
