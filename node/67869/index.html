  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys, so this is my first run at a real logo for my photography. I've been trying for something clean, modern, not overpowering and artistic. I feel like i'm starting in the right direction but am struggling to bring it all into one piece. The hardest part is that I'm not just '"fill in your name here" Photography'. Its called "Socal Lag" but i'm also playing with the idea of incorporating my name into it as well. I feel like its complicated to make it simple because of the name but I feel like it can work! 

Thanks in advance for the harsh critiques! lol

Can you give some more info about the company name?
If it's "Socal Lag" what's your idea behind writing it "SoCal" and what about the baseline shift on "Lag".

That'll help us understand what you're trying to achieve.</div>

But I cannot in any way refer "Lag" to photography...

That said, about the logo itself: why "Lag" is placed like it's superscript?
The type appears a little too thin, It could get lost at smaller sizes.
Maybe you can try a more squared typeface too.
The placement of the name don't work so well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">K, you make a good point on the Lag. 
Its meaning is in the slower life style that we have here. My business isn't just photography. While I do the normal weddings, senior portraits, head shots for actors and freelance jobs, I also do design for brochures, front end of sites, and other smaller jobs. 
I wanted something that would show that it isn't the normal fast paced 'I'm here and then I'm gone' kind of vibe. I get to know my clients and there vibe before I start working with them, I feel like that makes a difference in the type of work I produce. I know its hard to express all that in a name but I feel like if I can capture just a little bit of that in the branding then after you meet me it will all click. Let me know if that doesn't make sense.

I agree with the superscript of lag being confusing. I feel like when its all on the same line it doesn't flow as well to the eye. That may be because of the font choice. 

I have no strong feelings about the black element. I do like black and white tho, like most logos if I can create it to fit in B&W then it is easy to create other versions in color.

		<div class="commentbody">I’m not a native English speaker so maybe it’s just me but I keep reading either ‘so called Lag’ or ‘Social Lag’ into it. As long as you’re solely targeting people who immediately translate SoCal into Southern California this shouldn’t be much of a problem.
BTW, how would you speak out loud your studio name? Sometimes logos work well on paper but fail later because the name sounds odd when read.
And I second what Ross said, ‘lag’ prompts rather negative feelings (again, to me as a non-native E. speaker).

The logo itself: I think ‘photography’ is set a tad too tight. Also, the lc- l and the UC. L could use a little bit of space. Otherwise the lc. l risks to disappear in smaller sizes.

To me, too, SoCalLag and Photography still lack unity, maybe it’s the Ultra Thin weight and the rather big difference in size or the fact that ‘photography’ doesn’t visually align with the lower end of the ‘g’.

I get the same feeling about the name. Lag to me, would be: "fall behind (in production)", "to fail (to develop or achieve something)", "to decrease (interest)" or some impaired computer functionality.. but hey - I don't live in Southern California, so I don't know what'll work around there.

I just went through this with my own branding. 
It has taken forever and I'm still not sure I love it.


But, back to you...
If your work is good you'll get a reputation for getting to know your clients. Perhaps you should address this in an "about" page on your web site. I can imagine you'll alienate some potential clients with the "Lag".</div>

In regards to the Lag in the name I think I'm going to have to stick with it for right now. I would agree with changing it if I lived in any other area of the world but like Northbay mentioned, I'm going to have to stick to my intuition which feels like it fits well for this area.

This might give you guys a better understanding of the vibe that I'm trying to accomplish when everything ties together.

Thanks to Penn and Rat on the logo but I feel like the designs are to young in terms of target market. Trying to reach the 20 to 40 range so i'm trying for a stronger, more established feel.

All you guys are awesome, thanks for continuing to help me through the process!  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like Alex's extra space idea. It keeps it all on the same line and still plays with the laid back idea of what 'SoCal Lag' is. Jamming them all together just makes them seem like one word, forces them to be read too quickly and harms legibility. 

I'd also be cautious about using differing weights for the type as it'll give emphasis to whichever is heavier. Do you want 'Lag' to be emphasized over 'SoCal'? It's a common trend these days, and I'm wondering if it's appropriate in this case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">sorry bro, imo 2authentik seems kinda poser like. it's cocky not bold or original. SoCal is much better and has a way better vibe then 2authentik. instead of lag, is there another term used in your location that locals might interpret just the same? imo SoCal already has the slower lifestyle in it's dna just because its Southern California. No need to re-state it. know what i mean!? SoCal is relaxed and chill. Plus, it's versatile. It can be anything you want it to be.</div>
