  opinion about a typeface lately, and I want validation of my taste.\r\n\r\nSo check
  this out:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamond3_4009.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is a sample of American Garamond, or Garamond #3, or whatever the original name
  of it is, and its italic. I just got through reading three novels set in this, and
  I emerged with an acute desire to express my opinion on it, and solicit the opinions
  of real typographers to see if my instincts are good.\r\n\r\nSo. Before I opine,
  I want to know what y'all think. My sample text demonstrates what I want to point
  out, but I'm sure some of you guys have more extensive experience with this typeface
  to speak from. :)"

    belong to the same typeface.

    book typeface.

  body: The italic especially is misguided. I've heard it said that the erratic slope
    and poorly drawn letters give it an air of piquancy, but that to me said that
    it's good because it's bad. Rustic charm is only charming to an extent. The roman
    as well is too frail and lacks consistency. The stems that overshoot past the
    counters (p, d) are an especially poor touch. It makes me wonder how well this
    font corresponds to Claude Garamond's Vraie Parangonne. My bet is not very.

  body: "Well, I'm glad you guys bore me out. I was afraid that everyone would be
    on the \"piquant charm!\" boat you mentioned, Number3.\r\n\r\nBut no, I can't
    stand this typeface. My number one complaint on the Roman is b, d, p, and q. The
    bowls of all those letters seem badly misshapen to me, almost like they were flipped,
    rotated, and swapped around from the letters they actually belonged to. And I
    could almost stand the italic if it weren't for that a; the bowl(?) of the a just
    leans way too far to the right.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, thanks for participating in my
    little game, guys; I'll go back to lurking now. :)"

  body: "Garamond No.3 isn't based on a type of Claude Garamond's at all. It's based
    on the types of Jean Jannon, in a century after Garamond's.\r\n\r\nAs Robert Bringhurst
    points out in \"The Elements of Typographic Style\", Jannon's type belongs to
    the French Baroque era rather than Garamond's type, which has more Renaissance
    characteristics. Subsequently, Jannon's type has a rowdier form, especially in
    the italics, and these dissimilar slopes and stresses in the italic were deliberate
    design elements, not simply sloppy mistakes.\r\n\r\nOther types drawing from this
    same era have similar characteristics. Check out the italic of the various Caslon
    text types (Adobe Caslon, ITC Founders Caslon). Many of these same characteristics
    lasted into Calson's Neoclassical (\"transitional\") types as well.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Garamond 3, it is drawn closely from ATF's \"Garamond\" (Jannon) revival of
    the early 20th century, although as noted, it suffers from lighter drawing of
    many early digital revivals. I prefer Simoncini Garamond and Monotype Garamond
    for most uses -- they keep the lively structure of Jannon's letterforms, but seem
    much better weighted and balanced for text.\r\n\r\nFor good versions of Claude
    Garamond's types, I find Adobe Garamond to be a fine typeface.\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

  body: I don't view the italic "a"s as mistakes, but they are distracting enough
    that I have trouble reading "while comparing apples to apples".  That said, in
    a book size it's a whole different story.

  body: The thing which most bugs me about this sample of Garamond 3 is the HUGE  counter
    of the p. It is even larger than the q, which is large enough. You could drive
    a coach and four through it! Some keen typophile should bookmark this one as needing
    a better digitalisation. :)

    available. Here are a few of the better ones:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fyrisfonts.com/typsnitt/garajannon/book.asp
    (Multiple master available)\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/lanston/garamont.html (best
    for lager sizes\u2014too light and squished together out of the box to be useable
    for text)\r\n\r\nNeither of these fonts really look anything like either Garamond's
    or Jannon's fonts, IMO.\r\n\r\nThe standard \"Garamond #3\" is terribly ugly at
    anything larger than 10 pt.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a digital font that
    is based on ATF Garamont, but is somewhat different than the ones currently out
    there. I will not likely release it.\r\n\r\nThe version from the Impemerie Nationale
    is stunning, expecially the italic when set with the full range of ligatures."
