    of the horizontal and vertical stems?\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/degriz_6290.jpg]"

  body: It is completely possible. If i recall it correctly "D" is original and the
    rest of characters were wider in original font (as you say). Sorry for not mentioning
    it before. I just forgot. :)

    irritating. Still - one can't complain when getting a free gift, eh? Your font
    is the 24th from the left under "SELECT FONT".
