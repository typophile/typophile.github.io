body: I'm looking to hire a designer to create a wordmark / logo for my small business.
  I sell health & wellness products and am preparing to launch a clothing line, for
  which I need a new identity. If interested, please reply with a link to your portfolio.
  Thanks.

  body: I'm a graphic designer and although I'm not looking for new clients right
    now, I want to suggest that in addition to online searching you also check out
    local graphic design firms in Toronto. I'm sure there are many good ones, and
    you might be able to get recommendations from local business friends and business
    groups.
