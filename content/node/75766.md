  on a new project for a conference based in Windsor, UK. I'm experimenting with faces
  like Hoefler Black but I'm struggling with the spacing and kerning between the first
  two characters of the word Windsor. I'd like tight kerning on the whole word but
  as you can see with the basic example image (above), the upper case w seems disjointed
  from the remainder of the word causing an imbalance (to my eyes at least!).\r\nAny
  input, help and advice from all you Typophiles would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nweemac"

    is not a display font, it is designed for small recognition of the characters
    as wholes; that is why the thin strokes of W are heavier than the joints of n,
    r and d: because those stems are part of the basic shape of the letters, whereas
    the thinned joints aren't, and are relatively slight because they will \"fill
    in\" with ink or visual bleed. However, at display size, the fine stems and serifs
    no longer have to strive for attention, and should be scaled back.\r\n\r\nI would
    also consider overlapping some letters --i and n, d and s -- in the manner that
    the W and tittle have overlapped."

    to my eye this is less obtrusive, a less-strong binding (and more decorative);
    quite comparable to what you would see in say an \"f_i\" ligature. Whereas making
    serifs run into each other goes much further, in my eye/mind, into the direction
    of fusing letters together very strongly.* But hey, YMMV. \r\n\r\n* Which I personally
    find bothersome when it's not consistent. For instance, I've always disliked the
    concept of the logo of the Swiss <em>Coop</em> supermarket chain \u2013 it relies
    on overlaps between rounds, which you can pull off in \xABcoop\xBB\u2026 until
    you have to do \xABbank coop\xBB and get holes, which to me just makes the concept
    fail. Maybe I'm oversensitive, dunno.\r\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Bank_Coop_logo.svg"

    absolutely right about the problems I encounter when scaling the logotype. I've
    experimented and if I scale to less than 40mm in print (and 200px on screen),
    the characters join optically anyway. I'm reluctant to shave any more off the
    outer serifs as I don't want them to become smaller that the inner ones. If I
    do start to go down that road, it may have a negative knock-on effect as I'll
    have to alter all serifs to match the tweak. I don't want to potentially spoil
    something that is almost perfect for the sake of decimal points' worth of spacing
    (and my stubbornness!).\r\nWhat I've done is simply increase the spacing on \"i\"
    and \"n\" and \"d\" and \"s\" to compensate although, looking at the rendered
    jpeg again, could perhaps push a little more (shown in figures 2 & 3).\r\n\r\n@
    John Nolan\r\nFigure 1 shows the notch modification on the stem of \"W\" and tittle,
    which I completely agree with and have carelessly overlooked.\r\n\r\n@Arno Enslin\r\nIt's
    an interesting concept as I can see the notch where the missing stem used to be
    could slip nicely into the space between the left hand serifs on the \"i\".\r\nBut...
    my eyes simply see a hybrid \"X\" with some sort of radioactivity induced growth
    or prosthesis!"
