  body: Hi Fabio, <BR> <BR>Not bad at all. It feels very friendly. I think the bold
    version will be very nice.  <BR>Still I think you&#39;ll have to make a decision.
    I see that the UC &#39;Z&#39; and &#39;W&#39; have rounded corners. Most of the
    other characters don&#39;t have that. Perhaps you have to choose what you want;
    with of without rounded corners. Perhaps that will make it more homogenious. <BR>
    <BR>Furthermore I think you will have to tweak the thickness of some of the characters
    a little. Some feel to heavy / fat in the text. I&#39;m refering to the lc &#39;t&#39;,
    &#39;l&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;j&#39;. And the UC &#39;S&#39; and &#39;E&#39;.
    There&#39;s propably more, but these stood out when I had a quick overview. <BR>
    <BR>Keep on going the way you&#39;re going. I like it. <BR> <BR>PS  Can it be
    you used an existing typeface as a basic? Somehow it feels familiar to me but
    I can&#39;t put my finger on it. But maybe that&#39;s good. <BR> <BR>Regards,

    much into &#39;weight-watchers&#39;. <BR> <BR>Great that you totally created the
    type from scratch. For that it looks very professional and balanced. The longer
    you look for it the more you will find, so keep looking. Weight-control is very
    important, if you ask me, because then the type will present a very even image
    in a textblock. Black spots in the text are disturbing when you are reading the
    text. Especially with a light version. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren

  body: Well, besides the fact that I reserve the right to think that no sans can
    ever be a real text face, this one is too light and too constructed/mannered to
    &#34;hold&#34; a lot of text. But it&#39;s very cute, with great detailing, and
    there&#39;s no reason many people wouldn&#39;t love to use it for titling. So
    I recommend taking it in that direction - I think it has promise there. <BR> <BR>Overall
    the glyphs seems solid, and some of them have great character, like the &#34;i&#34;
    and the &#34;Q&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for the text block, I&#39;d say your overall
    letterspacing a bit tight. <BR> <BR>BTW, did you get the stuff on p4 from... that
    Swiss guy&#39;s book - what was his name? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR>The Bold is a little too close to the Regular. <BR>The &#34;K&#34;, &#34;k&#34;,
    &#34;x&#34; and &#34;y&#34; could use some curling at their bottoms. <BR>I&#39;d

    middle of the &#34;M&#34; is too light. <BR>The comma, &#34;S&#34; and &#34;U&#34;
    are malformed. <BR>The diagonals of the &#34;AE&#34; and the &#34;4&#34; are too
    thick. <BR>I think you can get more wild with the ampersand. <BR>The &#34;@&#34;
    is out of character. <BR>The square brackets are too dark. <BR> <BR>The spacing

    from legibility without adding stylistically. <BR> <BR>Also, the Registered sign
    &#40;a circled R&#41; should contrast with the copyright symbol &#40;a circled

    the copyright sitting on the baseline, and the registered raised so its top is

    fine, the four weights were all adjusted with a &#34;fine brush&#34; and seem
    much even and nice to me. &#40;check out the pdf&#41; <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m working
    on the italics, and I&#39;m not sure how to start. The GIF below is a beginning,

  body: 'Nice progress! <BR> <BR>In the Roman, the darker it gets the more &#34;wobbly&#34;
    the outlines. And overall there is some wobble too. <BR> <BR>I think your Light
    should be a hair darker &#40;and you could add an even lighter weights below it&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The &#34;M&#34; and &#34;r&#34; need work. <BR> <BR>Try a narrower &#34;4&#34;
    with a bowing diagonal. <BR> <BR>Spacing: I would tighten it up a hair &#40;but
    make the blank space very slightly wider&#41;. <BR> <BR>Italics: looks fine to
    me so far. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thanks Hrant for your comments. The M, r and 4 will be adjusted. <BR> <BR>I
    have finished the lowercase italics. I took as reference the FrutigerNext italics.
    What do you think? <BR> <BR>I really like the result. The italic curves reinforces
    the softness of the typeface and its elegant but friendly look. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:
