  body: Heheh, I think Adriano just commented on the fact that  <BR>Mark is so incredibly
    good at this game that - besides  <BR>identifying the font - he even might be
    able to tell which  <BR>software was used to produce the sample.

  body: Hmm... I think the font at the bottom is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-gothic/bold/testdrive.html?s=ExclusiveFauxFinishes&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">News Gothic</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-no-2/testdrive.html?s=ExclusiveFauxFinishes&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Trade Gothic</a> stretched. <BR> <BR>Chris, no need to feel stupid.
    It&#39;s hard to tell when people are joking around here sometimes. :-&#41;
