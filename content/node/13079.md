body: What are some other fonts that blend serif/sans in the same letters? Dead History
  is a great example of this, but just wondering if there have been others before
  or since.

  body: "Please note that Stephen Farrell's Missive is unique in that selection, since
    it uses parts of a Garamond, and parts of an earlier beta of Barry Deck's Arbitrary.
    An historical design collaged with a post-structural, almost contemporary one.
    It actually does not work so good in text, but the use of classic proportions
    (the Garamond-like Os) introduced an element of interest.\r\n\r\nOnce I designed
    a set of oldstyle numerals for it, although I never used it."

  body: "I recall (although memory not always reliable) that FontHaus published a
    large format magazine a while back with a page that used Missive as a text face,
    and it looked highly legible, even with, or perhaps because of, the serif on the
    \"o\". But perhaps the readability was a result of the inherently virtuous metrics
    and color of the constituent \"parents\". \r\n\r\nWasn't it also used in the US
    for a major credit card campaign?"
