body: "I was walking around Borders and Best Buy for a type specimen assignment, taking
  down some print covers/media that uses Bodoni and came across a few typefaces that
  i don't think were Bodoni or Didot and was wondering if someone could tell me what
  they are:\r\n\r\n\"The Last Lecture\"\r\nhttps://www.popular.com.sg/images/product/book/80307.jpg\r\n\r\n\"Picking
  Cotton\"\r\nhttp://www.dichosbooks.com/images/33446941.jpg\r\n\r\n\"Your Government
  Failed You\"\r\nhttp://www.harpercollins.com/harperimages/isbn/large/0/9780061474620.jpg\r\n\r\nPaul
  Mccartney's \"Memory Almost Full\" album\r\nhttp://ricardopeugrassi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/5225.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso,
  could someone tell me what common typefaces are out there that are similar to bodoni/didot/baskerville?\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great! :)"
