  Sorry for my english if I don't write correctly hehe.\r\n\r\nI have a trouble designing
  my first Tamil script. Specifically with the character \u0BB7 (Ssa). The typography
  I designing will be for wayfinding, and of course I want to be the most legible
  as possible. Searching in webs, I found three ways to draw this character, and my
  question is if one of them is more common, more correct, or more legible. I also
  could create an alternative character, but I prefer to know the best drawing for
  Ssa and then choose it as default.\r\n\r\nI attach a jpg with my three versions
  of Ssa.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tamil_Ssa_3999.jpg]"
