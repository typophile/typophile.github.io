    again in 17 seconds. Then it didn't work when  I tried it again.

  body: "Type it as one whole word at Myfonts. I tried posting the name and the link
    and received a notification from Typophile that it was spam. I then tried typing
    it as the name of the font only, without the link, and was told the same thing.
    The only way it worked was to break up the word like that.\r\n\r\nThink I'm going
    to stop participating here. Between this nonsense and some overbearing behavior
    about posts, I'm losing interest with this community"

  body: "I tried editing my second post (which is no longer here) again and Typophile
    deleted the whole post. \r\n\r\nSearch for the name I posted as one whole word.
    Typophile is blocking all of my posts including the one with the link."

    I cannot agree or disagree with your feelings on the subject. I guess I'll just
    have to find out for myself.\r\n\r\nSeems like that post was deleted, though. "
