    in perspective. Young, kind of punky and in-your-face...appropriate for the video
    game market.\r\n\r\nBut the 'r' is not legible: it's too easy to see an 'n' or
    an 'm' that's closed on the lower right....hrant's idea of UC form there may be
    the ticket, but perhaps then it will be difficult to center the 'e/r' on the crown
    once the 'o' must connect to the 'r' from the bottom....?\r\n\r\nThe thing I think
    is least successful is the tagline type. First, try the tagline \"It's your turn\"
    without the period. Then, look at it without the \"It's\" altogether: just \"Your
    turn\" with and without the period.....Also, try to differentiate the company
    name from the tagline more: the company name should perhaps be in tracked out
    upper case against the more conversational and informal lower case above....\r\n\r\nAnd
    Frutiger (oops, I guess it's actually Myriad) is just so sort of corporate & wayfinding
    \"friendly blah\" to me for this kind of mark. Try something with more edgy personality
    (perhaps digital-ish?) and maybe not a sans (the mark's forms are sans)...\r\n\r\nFun
    work for not being \"experienced with outline type designs\"!"

  body: "thanks for your feedback on a sunday afternoon!\r\n\r\ni have tried versions
    with an UC r, and as you might predict, it makes the interior spaces in the logo
    look too busy, and worse, ruins the symmetry of the logo. i have succeeded in
    getting the UC r to join the o at the bottom, but it just aint workin for me.\r\n\r\ni
    like your suggestions, dish, for the tag. i love playing with tags. they're so
    cool. however, i'm still stumped on what face to use. i tend to think that for
    a logo like this, that is, a typographic one, that whatever face i use for the
    tag ought to be as plain as possible, so there is no conflict for graphical attention.
    i've thrown in some trajan here, simply because it's 'kingly' in its appearance,
    but i'm not sold on it by any means, as it really departs from the comic/pow look
    i'm trying to hit.\r\n\r\nnow, as for the r... i'm not sure i like this solution,
    or even if this is a solution. i do think that it brings out the r more, without
    destroying the o. still, the o looks more like a d than it did before.\r\n\r\nso
    here's where things get interesting: per the first version, i was banking on the
    'recognizability' of the word hero to slip the reader over the problematic r.
    is this a horrible nono for logo design? i know that the concept is used all the
    time, as graphics sometimes replace critical letters altogether in other logo
    designs.\r\n\r\ni guess the point to focus on, is if something looks amateurish
    or not. if it looks like a mistake, or a weak point in the design, it is not the
    same thing as a well-executed graphic treatment of text, no?"

  body: "Tyler,\r\n\r\nI think I may have noodled out some interesting solutions for
    you while munching on dinner.......\r\n\r\nFirst, yes it's a problem to assume
    recognizability in a word instead of paying close attention to the actual letterforms
    as they exist on the page. Our minds play all sorts of tricks on us, and often
    what we assume may be the only reading of something turns out to be open to many
    readings....\r\n\r\nThis word in particular has few alternate readings though.....perhaps
    if someone was a big mythology buff, they may see Zeus' wife Hera, but probably
    not. Still, you can make the word more legible as is by:\r\n\r\nROUNDING THE COUNTER
    of the \"O\".\r\n\r\nInstead of focusing on fixing the \"r\", an easy solution
    to the legibility issue is simply to ignore the alignment with the crown's angle
    you were trying to repeat from the \"H\". Once it's round, three things can happen:\r\n\r\n1.
    The letter is instantly \"O\"-ish because you read the counter before the form
    since it stretches up to the right so far.\r\n2. An interesting help occurs for
    the \"r\".....the counterform \"o\" also becomes a ball terminal for another \"r\"
    in the counterform!! Double the benefit...\r\n3. The connection to the crown's
    angle can still be maintained by keeping the intersection of that angled line
    and the counterform as the \"spring point\" for the round counter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,
    on to the problem of tagline type:\r\nI did several versions to show what I had
    in mind. Most are sans solutions and the last two are serifs.\r\n\r\n1. Close
    Call PM: techy video-game feel.\r\n2. DIN: still techy, but more tailored and
    machined.\r\n3. Briem Akademi: very video game score display-ish.\r\n4. Charlemagne
    + Chapparal: You said you wanted the \"kingy\" aspects of Trajan.....Charlemagne
    is a little spikier and plays on the crown idea....but for those spikes to still
    read in the smaller company name, I used Chapparal.\r\n5. Scala + Scala Sans:
    Still the spiky, thorny, crown reference, but more modern and engineered....and
    interesting \"W\" in the company name sans version.\r\n\r\nGotta get back to \"real\"
    work,\r\nCheers and Happy Holidays!\r\nDiSH\r\n1.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hero_DiSH_CloseCall_6717.png]\r\n2.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hero_DiSH_DIN_6531.png]\r\n3.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hero_DiSH_BriemAkedemi_6356.png]\r\n4.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hero_DiSH_CharleChapa_3919.png]\r\n5.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hero_DiSH_Scala_5532.png]"

    line is no longer in the bowl of the \"O\", it makes the \"H\" seem unnecessarily
    thick to me.\r\n\r\nHe should probably give up on the symmetry and look at it
    with the bottom flattened out, the capital \"R\" you suggested, and leave the
    \"O\" be off center to the right. Then the taglines could be put to the right
    of the mark instead of below, or at least below and to the right..."

  body: To me, it seems as though the logo is best without the tagline, and then when
    you want to include it, you should have huge 3D text in vibrant colours, maybe
    with the crown sitting on the end of the letters.
