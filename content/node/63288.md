body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've written a set of 5 interconnecting short stories which I'm
  just starting to design. I want each story to have its own typeface, reflecting
  the central character. I've written profiles for each character that I think could
  be related (partially of course) to characteristics or features of a font. \r\n\r\nI've
  tried to find a website where you can browse fonts by date of design and other specifics,
  but I've had no luck. I swear that fontshop used to offer that service but I can't
  find anything other than category, foundry or designer on their website now. If
  anyone could point me in the right direction I'd be very grateful as always.\r\n\r\nIf
  not, my characters have the following short profiles. I know it's a pretty unusual
  and difficult long shot but if anyone has any fonts spring to mind when reading
  any of them I'd love to know.\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\nJono\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacter
