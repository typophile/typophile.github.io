body: I recently came across this set of metal letters amongst my late grandfather&#39;s
  possessions. I assume they were once used for signage of some sort, though I haven&#39;t
  seen anything like them and am quite curious as to their origin. The box is quite
  old, made of wood and has absolutely no identifiable markings. <BR> <BR>They are
  made of a very thin metal, &#40;about one inch in height&#41; perhaps aluminum or
  something similar and are hand painted orange and white. It contains the full alphabet
  with numerals and punctuation. On the right side of the box &#40;see photos&#41;
  there is a small metal board with what resembles lead em spaces, though made of
  a lightweight magnetic material. <BR> <BR>Has anyone seen a set like this? <BR>

    my guess is they&#39;re for placing down and photographing. <BR> <BR>hhp

    ago. <BR>Nothing as exquisite as these however. I will post <BR>some scans tomorrow,
    if that&#39;s okay. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Perhaps this is a precursor to the black signs with white plastic letters
    that you see in corporate lobbies, usually with messages like &#34;Acme Corp.
    welcomes Zara Evens.&#34; <BR> <BR>The magnets would go on the back of black metal
    board to hold the letters in place. The whole thing would then slide into some
    kind of display stand, or rest on an easel.  <BR> <BR>Just a guess, though. Very
    cool find!

  body: It looks like the A and 4 are reversed, and maybe one of the Zs. <BR> <BR>My
    guess is that Hrant is on the right track, and that they are for photographic
    titles, in films or for slides. <BR> <BR>The magnets could act as spacers, so
    you can create a nice drop shadow. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen a similar style of art
    deco lettering used for titling in a 35mm colour slide show &#40;but made out
    of a thick white material&#41;. The slides dated from the mid &#39;50s. <BR> <BR>The
    appeal of this &#34;Broadway&#34; kind of Deco style at that late date would be
    because of its ease of manufacture.  <BR> <BR>While there were commercial lettering
    kits available, it&#39;s the kind of project you would find in Popular Mechanics
    magazine. Or maybe even an amateur photography magazine. <BR> <BR>Was your Grandad
    a bit of a handyman, Zara? Did he make these himself? Did he have the photography
    bug, too?

  body: Nick, I think I have a set of the same thick, white lettering. And it is definitely
    made for creating dimensional titles - specifically for 8mm and 16mm home movies.
    The depth of the characters made it perfect for side-lighting and shadow-casting.
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a sweet set of  letters, Zara.

  body: 'Hi Zara! <BR> <BR>You&#39;re in luck! I first came in contact with these
    types of letters at Typecon last year as the folks from Timeless Treasures had
    an entire collection of pin-backed ceramic letters that John Downer informed me
    were used for department store marquees in the 40s and 50s which were in the front
    of the store to guide shoppers to featured specials, etc . . . <BR> <BR>Anyhow,
    Joan was kind enough to loan me some of these letters to turn into typefaces.
    The first result of this effort is a new freeward font called &#39;Featured Item&#39;
    check it out at: <a href="http://www.fontdiner.com" target="_blank">http://www.fontdiner.com</a>
    <BR> <BR>Beyond that, I have another set of letters Joan loaned me which were
    grossly incomplete but very cool looking. A few eBay searches later and I found
    the originals! Turns out they were no for store signage but as previously suggested
    in this post, were for home theater titling boards. . . . A great find at $9.99
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3853050776"
    target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3853050776</a>
    <BR> <BR>Anyhow, one thing that makes these letters so sweet is that they are
    very unique type styles that have essentially disappeared into history since they
    were in essence never cast by a foundry and only exist in this format for this
    purpose by the original manufacturers. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Stuart :D'

    them in a different category from shop or theatre marquee lettering.

  body: As these were probably used for film/slide titling, they are no longer &#34;merely&#34;
    letters, but can be considered as type, specifically, strange as it may seem at
    first, phototype. Even if there is only one font, the design is a typeface in
    its own right.

    in a set like this to make it usable for marquees; it seems enough for one-shot
    settings. Plus the quality seems overkill for a department store  - compare it
    to that eBay item. <BR> <BR>&#62; can be considered as type <BR> <BR>There is

    <BR> <BR>Sure, Letraset and Phototypositor &#40;eg VGC filmstrip&#41; had sidebearing
    indications, but most typographers who used those systems, good or bad, ignored
    them and spaced by eye. <BR> <BR>Now you may not like the results, but can you
    really say that those technologies weren&#39;t typesetting?'

  body: A technology that includes sidebearings is type. A user who ignores the sidebearings
    is doing lettering. Nothing anal about understanding the central role of White.
    Do you like the fact that Quark over-rides a type designer&#39;s determination
    of the proper size of the blank space in his fonts? <BR> <BR>hhp
