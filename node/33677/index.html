  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Optima is certainly amongst the most readable (and used) sans serifs, but how readable do you guys really think it is? I mean for setting extended text, like say a book. Hermann Zapf's "About alphabets" was originaly printed with the metal type Optima and that was quite readable. But the digital versions aren't quite as strong. Except maybe Optima nova, which has a colour closer to the original metal type, but has anyone actually tested it out?

Look at Pascal in comparison:

		<div class="commentbody">I find it very grey and bland in text. It's got a consistent vertical stress and very wide shapes, and the basic weight, while appropriate for letterpress, looks too light and wispy in digital form. You could try the Medium weight of the new version, but that only solves the basic weight issue. Linotype has printed specimens of Optima Nova, which you could get to see the performance in text. I've seen the original digital Optima in text but at uncommonly large sizes. There are <a href="	http://www.beorcana.com/">other alternatives,</a> however.....  ;)</div>

I've got a client  that uses it as their standard text face, for both print and pdf, for publications directed at primarily an older audience, but that is attractive enough for "young'uns."  :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, this is our monthly bash Optima thread. Again, I don't agree. The original is too grey in text, but is wonderfully elegant when well used in display--especially the caps. I don't know how much the Optima Nova fixes the greyness--it is obviously intended to--as I don't have it and haven't seen examples. 

The Pascal is very impressive, but I don't see it as an alternative to Optima, they are so different. 

Tiepolo and Carl's Beorcana seem to be more in the same space, but Beorcana is way better, IMHO.

		<div class="commentbody">cool, thanks guys! i hadn't actually seen any specimens of Optima nova but it does seem to be a still too grey. However I have to say I still quite like it as a display type, even tho im not so big on those new ligatures they've added.

Pascal really is quite impressive. I think its what I was going for, did you ever find out where to buy it from hrant, or are they still working on that?

As for Tiepolo and Beorcana, Tiepolo seems a bit too quircky for me right now but Beorcana is quite nice.

Click on the "<strong>bauer</strong>types" button and do a search for "Pascal" at the top-left.
The site seems to be in Spanish-only though...
