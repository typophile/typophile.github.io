  if you create a document which uses this font, and embed this font or unaltered
  portions of this font into the document, this font does not by itself cause the
  resulting document to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception
  does not however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
  by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may extend this
  exception to your version of the font, but you are not obligated to do so. If you
  do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.\"\r\n\r\nPlease
  state other differences between GPL and OFL.\r\n"

  body: "The OFL has other clauses having to do specifically with typefaces. There
    is a clause that allows redistribution freely, sale of the typeface bundled with
    other products, but not sale of the typeface by itself. There is also a clause
    that requires changing the name of any modified versions of the typeface, meant
    to protect the good name of the original typeface if someone makes poor modifications,
    I would guess.  That's my memory of the differences, aided by a quick scan of
    the license.\r\n\r\nst"

  body: "The two (the OFL and the GPL+font exception) are quite different, although
    both are valid free/libre and open source software licensing models for fonts.
    Although the GPL+font exception model is legally valid, we feel that it does not
    fit fonts well, and actually discourages the release of free/libre fonts, so we
    created the OFL. The philosophical differences are that the OFL does a better
    job of protecting designers in an understandable way and places less restrictions
    on the use of derivative works. That's a gross oversimplification, but gives you
    the general idea.\r\n\r\nFor a lot more detail, read the [[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web|OFL
    itself]] carefully (it's a lot less wordy than the GPL), and consult the newly-updated
    [[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web|OFL-FAQ]].\r\n\r\n"
