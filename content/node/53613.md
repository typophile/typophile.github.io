  my eye. It's so simple, yet it still has some elegance to it. The tree on the cover
  reminds me of the little scribbles I make in my notebook. I couldn't find a picture
  of the back cover, but it has similar swirls around the edges.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3willows

  is so familiar, but I've never read it. I love the cover. I like the color scheme
  and the simple design...I think it has a sort of Asian feel to it. It is simple
  and elegant and I like it, and even though stacking type is a type crime I love
  how the author's name makes the cover asymmetrical.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joy

  body: "the author's name works well for stacking type actually...as long\r\nas the
    letters look secure and not as if they are about to topple\r\nover stacked type
    can sometimes look quite nice..."
