  architectural group. They need a logo, letterhead, envelope, flayer, postcard, poster...for
  some reason they mentioned the font \"Calibri or designer choice\" in the brief,
  they also have included some logos that I guess they like(see the attached file).\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://i51.tinypic.com/2s7gbpt.gif\"/>\r\n\r\nAre there any font's that you
  would recommend or some sites for inspiration.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

  body: "IMO architects' taste in typography is anything but contemporary.\r\nThey
    seem to be stuck in the modernist vein, and these examples are conservative like
    that, traditional modernist identities.\r\n\r\nMy parents were architects, and
    used a lot of Clarendon (Letraset) back in the day.\r\nI made a Christmas card,
    a painting plus words in Letraset Clarendon, c. 1960.\r\nSorry, Catalonia, that's
    retro.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what the box kite has to do with Cooper Union.\r\nYeah,
    isometric perspective as optical illusion, we get it -- a clich\xE9/meme used
    in the Harvard logo too, more about the graphic designer's take on architectural
    design than communicating a business/institution to its audience."

    or something slabby like PMN Caecilia or Lubalin Graph (which always reminds me
    of architectural drawings)?</em>\r\n\r\nWhy does architecture still need to be
    evoked by referencing the simplest of mechanically drafted shapes, those made
    with compasses and ruler? How very masonic! Or is it some kind of de Stijl thing?
    (Architects were not averse to using oval templates and French curves, not to
    mention quadratic equations to support domes.)\r\n\r\nStrange, after such iconic
    progressive 20th century buildings as the Ronchamps chapel and the Sydney Opera
    House, and any number of polymorphic Autocaded blobs by Gehry and Foster. \r\n\r\nClaire,
    rather than going on your client's typographic suggestions (WTF do they  know?
    -- didn't they hire a designer to make those decisions!), get your type cues from
    their work."
