body: "I am looking for font recommendations from this intriguing group of font mavens.
  \r\n\r\nProject: A 160-page manual/workbook on judging floral design.\r\n\r\nPurpose
  of book: To provide a fresh look at a stale and entrenched judging process.\r\nPrimary
  audiences are two divergent groups:\r\n\u2022\tPerhaps 40% of the audience is sophisticated,
  trendy and highly creative floral designers.\r\n\u2022\tPerhaps 30% of the audience,
  though very creative, is fairly regimented and regards the current judging process
  as sacrosanct. As conservative as they are, they are always diligent and anxious
  to expand and grow, though change comes painfully slowly, and only after much deliberation.\r\nAdditional
  uses of book:\r\n\u2022\tManual for training new judges\r\n\u2022\tPart of curriculum
  for students of floral design, primarily at the college level.\r\n\r\nStyle of the
  book:\r\n\u2022\tMost likely it will be a clean, well-designed contemporary look,
  signaling a fresh approach to the serious topic of judging.\r\n\u2022\tPossibly
  a traditional look.\r\nMy taste:\r\nIt generally runs from such classics as Centaur,
  Bembo, Goudy Old Style (or Fabiol), Scala, Vendetta Light, Requiem, PMN Caecilia,
  to Cholla Slab, Gotham and Quartet to\u2026well, what are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nWhat
  I\u2019m looking for:\r\nSuggestions for serif and sans serif fonts that complement
  each other. I would be appreciative of fonts for both a contemporary and traditional
  version of the book, and for possibly a script font. \r\nOpen Type suggestions are
  particularly desirable.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions or caveats?\r\nThanks for giving
  your time and expertise to my project.\r\n"

    and perhaps some of your fonts might be a good match.\r\nI presume you have suggestions
    beyond your fonts as well. \r\n\r\nThank you. I shall email you.\r\n\r\nKathy"

  body: "Kathy!\r\n\r\nThe reason why i don't post type proposals (my own) directly
    on Typophile any more is mainly because some users are getting offended by the
    fact that Me and other independent designers make self-promotion here. I therefor
    keep a lower profile as for now... now since the \"Eartlink server\" refuses to
    accept my e-mails and consider them as spam (quite funny though) I make an exeption
    for this time.\r\n\r\nI do think some of my typefaces would fit for this book.\r\n\r\nHeadline
