  in which she referenced an \"Expertype typositor book\". This lead me to wonder,
  how can I get a hold of a book like this? Are they rare, if not which ones are the
  best? I have an old book entitled \"Printing design and Layout\" by Vincent Steer.
  It has a few examples of typefaces but I imagine pattyfab's book is much more extensive.\r\n\r\nAny
  input is appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "She's probably referencing the Typositor section of a type book from a commercial
    typographer.\r\n\r\nThe Typositor machine was a product of Visual Graphics Corporation.
    One could hand-set type in an infinite range of sizes on paper from two-inch filmstrip
    masters. They had a type library of maybe a couple thousand fonts.\r\n\r\nThere
    are bound to be quite a few Typositor catalogs still around although it might
    be hard to persuade the owner to part with it. They can't be considered rare in
    a monetary sense, just hard to come by.\r\n\r\nIt is not the only type catalog
    either. There are those produced by commercial shops as well as those produced
    by type manufacturers and type resellers. You just have to seek them out.\r\n\r\n"
