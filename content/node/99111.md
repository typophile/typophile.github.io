    Neue Extended]] but, after having a look to [[http://www.massageheights.com/upload/Holiday2012/MH12_Holiday_RELEIVE_MAIN.png|this
    bigger sample]] from website banner, that's definitely not it. It is close to
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aah-yes/sanzettica/|Sanzettica]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aah-yes/newsanse/|Newsanse]]
    or [[http://www.dafont.com/sansumi.font|Sansumi]].\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/top_logo_5323.png]"
