  often used interchangeably. As I can understand, character set is a collection of
  characters, \"suerte\" in spanish, and a codepage is a coded character set (or multiple
  sets) used by an operative system.\r\nSo, UNICODE is a codepage or an encoding?
  I'm getting crazy!\r\nthanks"

    character set is any specific collection of characters. You could consider any

    some externally-defined one.\r\n\r\nA codepage is a character set used by a computer,

    For example, MacRoman is a codepage. Windows codepage 1250 (Eastern European)

  body: "Unicode is not a codepage, and I'm not sure if \"meta-codepage\" would be
    a useful description, either. \r\n\r\nThink of Unicode as a set of all possible
    character codes. A codepage is a subset of character codes in a particular order,
    usually limited to 256 characters.\r\n\r\nA little background: A \"page\" is a
    block or section of computer memory. In early personal computer systems, a page
    of memory was 256 bytes, the largest number that can be represented with 8 bits.
    Before Unicode, most standard character code systems used 8-bit encoding, so it
    was not possible to have more than 256 characters. So, an 8-bit character set
    could be thought of as a \"page\", and a codepage usually refers to any standard
    pre-Unicode 8-bit character set."

    codepage (and in many more).\r\n\r\nThink of Unicode as a label attached to the

    in computer systems Unicode is largely replacing codepage based approaches, and
    for good reasons. Instead of having dozens of codepages each using (and re-using)
    the same numbered slots for different characters, each character gets its own

    Not on the Mac anyway. But you are right. This keyboard issue is a source of a
    lot of confusion and incompatibility amongst programs and platforms, particularly
    for non Roman languages.\r\nI'm guessing keyboards on Windows are always 8-bit

    This causes many cases of 'lost in translation' issues, for example for mirroring

    keyboards, it is always left parenthesis, subject to interpretation based on the
    language setting. But it may well be done with Unicode encoding as well I suppose.

  body: "I have to get back to you on this when I get a chance to test it extensively.
    But here is what I gather now:\r\nIn Windows, you can produce an rtf Arabic (or
    Persian whatever) text, send it to a Mac, and reproduce the text in the Mac. No
    problem. When you do the same in the Mac, whether it is Persian or Arabic, there
    is no 'codepage' per se, only the appropriate keyboard. And when it is imported
    to Windows, it defaults the content to 'Arabic' if it does at all, and also it
    looses its mirroring effect. I know a lot of Mac users have trouble keeping their
    page layout intact when imported to Windows. I'll give you more detail when I
    get a chance.\r\nUnicode doesn't identify a text as 'Arabic' (I wish it did!)
    only rtl. The rest is within the encoding. But it doesn't seem to work that way.
    If you look at the keyboard layout of an rtl Mac keyboard, the opening parenthesis
    is encoded as left parenthesis (which will mirror in rtl and become right parenthesis).
    If you look at a Windows rtl keyboard layout, the parenthesis are exactly the
    same as for ltr. The encoding has to be modified first, then mirrored in the process
    when the rtl content is recognized by the application. When it imports directly
    from a Mac for example, one of these two, modifying or mirroring is not happening."

    If you look at the keyboard layout of an rtl Mac keyboard,\r\n> the opening parenthesis
    is encoded as left parenthesis\r\n\r\nFrom a Unicode perspective, there's no such
    thing as left parenthesis, just opening and closing parentheses. What they look
    like depends on whether you're in RTL or LTR.\r\n\r\nNow, it's possible that the
    Windows Arabic keyboard takes the thing that looks like a \"left\" paren on the
    keyboard and treats that input as an opening paren in the English keyboard and
    as a closing paren when you're using the Arabic keyboard. But whether or not it
    does so, this is unrelated to what happens with Arabic text moving between Mac
    and Windows....\r\n\r\nSomebody who is really familiar with Arabic typesetting
    might be able to help decode the particular problems you're seeing, but you'll
    need to be a lot more specific about two things:\r\n\r\n1) How are you producing
    the RTF Arabic text on the Mac? (Application, font, font format)\r\n\r\n2) In
    what Windows application are you opening that Mac-created RTF text file? \r\n\r\nIt's
    in one of those steps that the problem likely lies.\r\n\r\nI'll just note on the
    side that Mac Word doesn't support Arabic last I heard.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n"
