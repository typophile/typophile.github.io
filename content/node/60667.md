  idea is to integrate a symbol I\xB4ve made into the text in the logo. Last letter
  of the text is \"d\" and the symbol looks similar to the letter \"d\".\r\n\r\nThe
  symbol fits quite nice in combination with bauhaus and similar fonts, here it\xB4s
  combined with Horatio bold.\r\nBut I\xB4m not sure. I would like to find a font
  that look a bit more strict and serious. To me this is a little bit too playful
  for health care. But I kind of like the symbol. Any suggestions for a more subtle
  font that still would look good combined with the symbol?\r\n\r\nEventually the
  logo will have another colour than black. I might accent the cross in the d/symbol
  in some way too.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n//J\r\n"

  body: "What you have looks pretty good in terms of matching the symbol with the
    font. If you pick a different font for a more \"subtle\" look, you will need to
    re-draw the symbol, unless you are looking for another round geometric font. \r\n\r\nFor
    example, would [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=FF+Max&x=17&y=13&sample_text=svenska%20vard&sample_size=48|FF
    Max]] or [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=FF+Dax&x=17&y=9&sample_text=svenska%20vard&sample_size=48|FF
    Dax]], in one of it's wider variants, work for your design?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hmm, [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cocon_1_ot/?&sample_text=svenska%20vard&sample_size=48|FF
    Cocon]] has an interesting shape that adds more movement to these letters.\r\n\r\n-
