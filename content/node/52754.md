    limit.\r\nAnd Belizio? That would be horse and buggy racing.\r\nOr am I being
    to literal in interpreting the associative qualities of a 1980s revival of a 1950s
    revival of an 1850s typeface?"

  body: "Well it's something to consider, but not the absolute word.\r\nAfter all,
    Saab uses Gill Sans as its corporate face, which I think is inappropriate, and
    it doesn't seem to be an issue.\r\nBut I think Chris' advice is good, which seems
    to be that if you're going for the contemporary look of, say, slab serifs, use
    a present-day original design, rather than a revival."
