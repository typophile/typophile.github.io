in the last day I started to draw these letters. I started with a sketch I made while thinking about the recent Legato thread. I don’t know if I will be able to transform these in a complete set of characters, so I decided to start the thread.</p>
<p>The idea is behind my initial sketch was the contrast between an upright counter and a stretched contour (the dashed lines, more or less).</p>
<p>That’s all, I must say that I quite hate the &lsquo;a&rsquo;.</p>

I&rsquo;m not sure about the high weight at the bottom of the left stem in the &ldquo;n&rdquo;, though I think it works well in the other letters.
The &ldquo;p&rdquo; is quite good, but I&rsquo;d try a shorter descender.
Your idea is promising.
I&rsquo;d like to see more.</p>

<p>I agree the &ldquo;a&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t quite click with the others yet. It looks kind of… bored. I think maybe the bowl might reach too far over to the left? Also not sure about the terminal.
I like the &ldquo;o&rdquo; a lot. I have a somewhat similar sketch of an &ldquo;o&rdquo; sitting on my hard drive ;-)</p>

<p>I also shortened the descender of p (now it is similar to the ascender but I still have to decide a good proportion) and made an &rsquo;m'. the problem with the m is the middle stem.

What do you think?</p>

<p>Yes the l is more slanted, I made it like that for some reason. But now it seems simply wrong. Or I can slant everything like that to avoid the &lsquo;zone&rsquo;.</p>

Be aware of slanting it all, except you want to make a slanted-non-regular face.
In my opinion, the middle leg of the &ldquo;m&rdquo; should be slanted, not by repeating the right leg of the &ldquo;n&rdquo;, but by interpolating the left one (just look at the counters, instead of the strokes).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This looks pretty charming, although frankly I&rsquo;m not seeing the essence of Legato click yet (assuming that&rsquo;s something desirable for you). And Avance is certainly echoing in your design. Enough so that I might make this practical suggestion: make this into a direct companion for Avance - maybe even a font somebody might use for special emphasis in place of Avance&rsquo;s own italic. To do this you would have to match the apparent size and color of Avance (or possibly its Italic).</p>
<p>As for your slant, I think it&rsquo;s a good deal outside the barfogenic zone* (although it does depend on point size, and you seem to be aiming small, which makes the zone larger). You might still want to increase it though (especially if you go with the idea above).</p>

<li>For the record, I got that term from a book about multimedia, in reference to animations with frame rates of between 8 fps and 15 fps, which can actually induce physical nausea (because the human &ldquo;firmware&rdquo; can&rsquo;t decide if its moving or not).</li>

I decided to slant a bit more, now the angle is 3 degrees (at small sizes I start to understand the &lsquo;zone&rsquo;). I added letters, even if they are only sketches, to start seeing how it works in a small text, so I really appreciate comments and critiques.</p>
<p>The design is so curvaceous (is it a word?) that achieving a certain uniformity in stems weights is a big problem. Also, I added to much weight at the connection between the stem and the curve in m, n, etc. the previous solution was a better one.</p>

<p>This has good potential of being jolly while still having strength, and so a very nice display face. Since your angles and bulges are freely drawn&ndash;which makes it nice&ndash;getting the weights right is tough, as you say. That why they will pay you the big money :)</p>
<p>Try making the l more straight rather than more slanted than the mn and see how you like it. To me it looks like the a is a little haughty should bow his head in prayer :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Terrific work!</p>
<p>Did you strengthen the arm or the leg of &lsquo;k&rsquo;? I meant before that the arm (top diagonal stroke) looked a touch weak, and I think it still might.</p>
<p>You could consider lengthening the right side of the bottom serif of &lsquo;f&rsquo; to balance it out (although a little forward lean seems to be part of the character of this font).</p>
<p>The way the bottom terminal of &lsquo;c&rsquo; stretches right seems to pull that letter &ldquo;upright&rdquo; instead of leaving the forward lean I just mentioned. I&rsquo;d need a text setting to judge whether that would stick out or not. I think a text setting could also help tell if the &rsquo;s'&rsquo;s balance works. (I hope it does.)</p>
<p>Does the crossbar of &rsquo;t' get too pinched as it intersects with the downstroke?</p>
<p>Besides the appealing drawing of the characters, I like the bounciness of this font, particularly as it&rsquo;s pulled off with such strict horizontals at the base-, x-height-, and cap-lines.</p>

I started thinking that the problem with s was its width, and now I have two s, one more balanced (the new) and one wide.</p>

<p>I wonder if M&rsquo;s central vertex should be brought up above the baseline. The glyph could be widened a bit, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d think about lowering e&rsquo;s crossbar a hair; while you don&rsquo;t want to regularize it too much, that small counter does threaten to close up at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>A kind of looks &ldquo;scalped&rdquo; to me. Did you try any serifs or other, more &ldquo;weighty&rdquo; solutions to the top vertex?</p>

I also wonder about the u. Should it lean a bit more?
And the g seems to big too big. The top counter of the g is almost as big as the p. I&rsquo;d think it shouldn&rsquo;t be so.
Is the r leaning too much? Or is the p leaning enough?
I think your first s was better.</p>

I’ve made some of the changes you suggested and now I also have all the uppercase letters. now I see big problems with the weights of some of the uppercase letters (W, N, W, for example) but I don’t know if it is my printer that worsen the situation at small size.
Uppercase S and J need to be redraw (maybe trying to extend J hook below the baseline), L stem needs, perhaps, to be more slanted.
Is it time to consider spacing?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Craig,
yes, the diagonal of N looks too heavy (but I see the same problem with other diagonals in W etc.). I need to fix it but I wonder if I will have also a problem with hinting. The problem of weights is the main issue with this font (and I really don’t know if I’ll be able to draw a bold version of it)</p>
<p>For R what I want to do is to reduce the upper part, now is too big.</p>
