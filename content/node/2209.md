    not easy ones, and it&#39;s even possible that  <BR>these fonts don&#39;t exist
    in digital form. I couldn&#39;t find  <BR>either of them in Rookledge&#39;s so
    I&#39;m up to doing an  <BR>extensive search, which will take some time.  <BR>Please
    bear with us. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    What on Earth might make you describe this font as &#34;Nazi Gold&#34; &#40;whatever
    that may be&#41;? <BR> <BR>According to the link you provided, &#34;[the] historical
    model [of Karolin] is the calligraphed and then woodcut titling of the Swedish
    King Charles XII&#39;s Bible, printed in 1703&#34;.'

  body: Hi David, I did a run through the FontBook looking for  <BR>that specific
    uc &#34;A&#34; with the top serifs, and only thing  <BR>I could find that somewhat
    looks like it is Richard Beatty&#39;s  <BR>digitization of F.W. Goudy&#39;s Goudy
    Italian, but it&#39;s not a  <BR>perfect match. And I couldn&#39;t even find an
    online sample. <BR> <BR>The Fraktur is hand lettered. I tried to find a similar  <BR>one,
    but the capitals are always off. I know there is a  <BR>type foundry specialized
    in blackletter type that got  <BR>mentionned a couple of months ago. Anyone knows  <BR>where
    to find it?

    these nice fonts &#40;well some of them!&#41; is almost killing me...  i am so
    glad i do not have so much money to spend otherwise i would lay them all on fonts
    &#40;&#43; girls&#41;..   <BR>i really got hooked on that House Ind Chalet i saw
    in another post the other day.  <BR>Man that was mean! <BR> <BR> <BR>sometimes
    it is a pity that the &#34;fraktur&#34;style has a become so unpopular because
    of some germs in Das Dritte Reich...   and popular with heavyhardrock bands...
    <BR> <BR>they would have to force me to use a &#34;fraktur&#34;font... <BR>i would
    rather eat sauerkraut than doing so..   Swear 2 Dog and hope to fry, it is the
    truth!!'
