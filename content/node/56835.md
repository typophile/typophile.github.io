  body: Going for elegance at small sizes could be tricky, since features that are
    often associated with elegance such as delicate hairlines don't work at those
    scales. Anyway, I'll add <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_serif_a">Fedra
    Serif A</a> to the list of suggestions.

  body: "FF Clifford Six is very nice.\r\n\r\n@joeclark\r\nSeriously? Souvenir? I
    guess that the large x-height and lower contrast would certainly work well at
    those sizes. I've never tried it though, since it wouldn't have been the first
    to come to mind."

  body: Your example shows all-caps - if you care about the text being readable then
    why all-caps?

    case why would you want a readable font? "

  body: "I think elegant doesn't go together with readable at small size, particularly
    for lower case.\r\n\r\nBut they can look good. And if you want to go all cap,
    as your example indicates, then Engravers Gothic or Copperplate Gothic are among
    the most readable tiny, because of their wide characters. "
