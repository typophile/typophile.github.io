body: "I was wondering if anybody knew the name of the typeface used in the \"arkitip\"
  on the magazine cover that is attached below. A friend told me that it could be
  Romany, a copyright free font made by Dover Books, but I was looking to see if there
  is anything else you guys might think of.\r\n\r\nany help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.commonwealthstacks.com/product_details/2arkcover.jpg"
