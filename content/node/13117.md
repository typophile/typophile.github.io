body: "Oh type gurus, might you be so good as to offer your suggestions for an application
  which I might employ to search our voluminous company font archive for bitmap and
  font outlines with matching FOND IDs?\r\n\r\nBack in the day, <em>Font Reserve</em>
  used to be the bees knees for extracting such information but these days it misbehaves
  terribly (at least on my system). <em>Suitcase</em> doesn't offer the option of
  searching for FOND ID, and neither does <em>FontAgent Pro</em>.\r\n\r\nI have recently
  employed Morrison SoftDesign's <em>Font Doctor</em> to bring order to our collections,
  but it doesn't pay much attention to the differences between fonts of the same name
  from different foundries, opting to simply keep one copy of a font of a particular
  name. I am left thinking if only Font Doctor could build its archive in a similarly
  robust fashion to the Font Reserve of yore (ie: same-named fonts neatly stowed in
  folders named after their foundry), then I would be sure that my bitmaps paired
  with my printer fonts.\r\n\r\nAs it is, I'm left chasing around my Mac for fonts
  with matching IDs to better ensure compatibilty. (Please tell me I'm doing right
  in this respect?!)\r\n\r\nKeeping abreast of the licensing of our company font assets
  is proving a vast undertaking, so if you feel a particular application really cuts
  the mustard when it comes to building accurate font collections, I'd be extremely
  inerested to hear about it!\r\n"
