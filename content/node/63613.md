  body: "Actually it's a very interesting question.* Do you worry only about caps?
    What about the \"U\" and \"J\"? Do you worry about the font featuring common Latin-language
    or Roman-era contractions, etc.? Most of all I would work the angle that Latin
    uses far fewer letters that have extenders in the lc. So maybe something with
    a highly varied x-height region, to help along readability? Unless you're shooting
    for what Latin text is famous for: aesthetic regularity. Unless unless you're
    being even more aesthetically-minded and you'd like cuspy-cupped serifs... Like
    I said, an interesting question.\r\n\r\n* Maybe Andreas thought Erik meant Latin-script
    as opposed\r\nto Latin language? Which would indeed be a dumb question,\r\nalthough
    still not deserving Andreas's reaction.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sorry for my response everyone.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific,I was asked some
    advice on choosing a font to set a phrase of text written in the Latin language.
    Translated to English, the phrase means *Fortune favors the bold.* I am not sure
    how to say the phrase in Latin.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is cultural consideration.
    Should I choose a font from a particular historical era? Maybe a font created
    by a designer from a certain country? That is the type of stuff I would like to
    know.\r\n"

  body: "Well, I guess maximal cultural authenticity would require all-caps setting
    in an epigraphic font*; subbing \"V\" for \"U\" and \"I\" for \"J\"; and using
    a triangular midpoint instead of wordspaces. But the reader can never be ignored,
    so the \"culture\" of the user has to be factored in.\r\n\r\n* Hopefully not Trajan.
    Maybe La Gioconda by Farey & Dawson.\r\n\r\nWhat's the context?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "A good friend of mine is considering getting this as a tattoo. I just want
    to help him do the research and make sure he doesn't get something he will regret
    this. I guess he mostly cares about having it look cool since no one will be able
    to understand it besides him anyway.\r\n\r\nI have also been trying to learn more
    about fonts lately and not just choose a font because it looks nice, or it's popular.
    I am currently reading *The Elements of Typographic Style* by Robert Bringhurst.
    I figure by the time I am done reading it I will be more of an expert on fonts
    and typography. I am relatively young and I have just recently graduated from
    going to school for Graphic Design."

    a great start: http://typophile.com/node/15349\r\n\r\nTattoo, eh? Where is it
    going? Because the proportions of the space will be a major design constraint.
    For example if it's around the arm you want something narrow letterforms.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
