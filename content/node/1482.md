  body: ' Great work... <BR> <BR>He&#39;s working with one hand in the very old tradition
    of typedesign, and on the other, he&#39;s pushing the limits of it. His &#39;Balance&#39;
    typedesign is a sort of hommage towards Roger&#39;s Excoffon Antique Olive &#40;very
    un-dutch in it&#39;s design; compare it with the &#39;traditional&#39; dutch-designers
    like Gerard Unger &amp; martin majoor&#41;. His other typefaces, like &#39;avance&#39;
    &amp; &#39;cocon&#39; are very modern and unique. <BR> <BR>His typefaces are always
    from extreme quality. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry, for my bad english. I&#39;m dutch.
    &#40;I&#39;ve just finished my study at the art-academy in Arnhem, the netherlands;
    where Evert Bloemsma has studied also.&#41; '

    award to a book called &#34;John Kelly&#34;, and it uses the rara avis Avance
    to great effect &#40;I&#39;ll know more when I see the book itself&#41;, both
    in text and titles. But of course there&#39;s nothing about the font in the award
    review... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t make it very clear, but the fontshop
    &#40;in Holland&#41; made a few excellent publications, regarding some of their
    typefaces. Like the Scala, Quadraat, Fago and also the Avance &#40;by Bloemsma&#41;.
    Note!! ...they&#39;re all designed by dutch designers &#40;I know that Ole Schafer,
    who designed the &#39;FF Fago&#39; is German, but he studied in the Hague typedesign...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I think the publications can be ordered at <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.be"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.fontshop.be</A> &#40;the interface is in dutch, that
    might be difficult&#41; <BR> <BR>&amp; recently, the book &#39;letters&#39; was
    published in Holland. The book is enterily in Dutch but it consist of many texts
    by typographers like &#39;Erik van Blokland, Bram de Does &#40;from the beautiful
    Lexicon &amp; Trinit&eacute;, by <A HREF="http://www.TEFF.nl" TARGET="_top"> http://www.TEFF.nl</A>
    &#41;, Gerard Unger, Martin Majoor, Fred Smeijers, and... Evert Bloemsma.&#39;
    <BR> <BR>there is a small view of the book at <BR><A HREF="http://www.zooproducties.nl/prod21.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.zooproducties.nl/prod21.html</A> <BR> <BR>is this a bit
    more elaborate? <BR> <BR>forgive my bad english, <BR> <BR>ML
