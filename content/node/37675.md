  doing a assignment on types.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is draw a typeface build from
  element as you see in the img. The idea is based on different elements like corners
  which I can copy/paiste and hereby quickly create a new type-expression. The basic
  idea is inspired by things created in the Bauhaus periods and other who work systematic
  and so on...\r\n\r\nI\u2019m curious to hear what other typedesigners have of comments
  and if there is anything I should look into - while doing this type, that could
  help me in skipping steps (due to I\u2019m new in typedesigning).\r\n\r\nHope to
  from all of you designere.\r\n\r\nHave great day.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/O_5268.jpg]"
