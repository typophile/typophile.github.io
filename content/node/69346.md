  body: Reminds me of the work of <a href="http://www.motterfonts.com/">Othmar Motter</a>,
    especially Tektura and Neo-Textur. This is probably custom.

  body: "I think this is also the font used in the old Nortel logo, but I don't know
    what it is. Here are some more letters:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.seeklogo.com/images/N/Northern_Telecom-logo-DD45F26B02-seeklogo.com.gif\r\n\r\nNotice
    how neither logo contains upper case letters. Perhaps they weren't offered with
    the font.\r\n\r\nI also started a FontStruction based on this a long time ago.
    I'd like to find out what this one is as well so I can complete it :-)\r\n\r\n

    I wonder if it's a Canadian font.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think Florian is right about custom work, although this could surprise
    us by being a freebie -- geometric 'techno' looks are favorites in that realm.\r\n\r\nDon't
    know if you are interested in alternatives, but I looked for some single-story
    techno styles and have some suggestions (without links, sorry, but all at MyFonts):
    Coconut, Griffin, Honcho, Popgod, Dynamo and Gno.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is similar, and <a herf=\"http://www.dafont.com/weaponeer.font?nb_ppp=50&text=alberta\">Weaponeer</a>
    could probably be converted rather easily to look like this, by clipping off some
    pieces, and rounding corners a bit more.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
