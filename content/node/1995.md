    or not&#41;, he&#39;s had an uncanny ability to get clients to break out of the
    mold. And not always clients that you&#39;d expect to take those kind of risks.
    <BR> <BR>I love his quote: &#34;Don&#39;t mistake legibility for communication.&#34;
    This flies in the face of the old graphic design axiom that typography should
    be transparent &#40;that the type should remain unnoticed&#41; by the viewer.
    Not that I personally live or die by either one of these extremes. On the contrary,
    I think it&#39;s important to remember that in design everything has it&#39;s
    appropriate time; and design rules are best when they&#39;re broken well. Not
    merely breaking rules just because you can, but breaking them when it serves the
    communication. <BR> <BR>He&#39;s also had the ability, with maybe a handful of
    other graphic designers, to become known outside the design world. <BR> <BR>All
    that aside, it&#39;s troubling that one of the top-selling design books of all
    time remains his <i>End of Print</i>. The danger of David as a vanguard of design
    &#40;in the mid &#39;90s anyway&#41; is the minions of people who copied him without
    knowing why they were doing it. But, then again, is it fair to fault him for that?'

    do agree with that. I also think we shouldn&#39;t mistake an artiste for a craftsman
    - noting that we need the latter more these days. I guess my main problems with
    Carson are that: he seems to care about the wrong things; and that he sold out.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve only seen Carson speak once &#40;ATypI-Boston&#41;, and two
    things bothered me: <BR>1&#41; His jab against Gerard Unger, who had presented
    earlier in the day. <BR>2&#41; All the Gen-X idiots fawning to lick his boots
    afterwards. They wouldn&#39;t know type if a case of CooperBlack-72 fell on their
    heads. <BR> <BR>&#62; it&#39;s troubling that one of the top-selling design books
    of all time remains his End of Print. <BR> <BR>Not least because it&#39;s a book!

  body: 'Ha! <BR> <BR>I must say I was quite inspired by Carson&#39;s work when I
    was in art school. It is remarkable to be able to use type in such spontaneous,
    painterly ways, and I think it does take talent, even skill. His work is more
    like &#39;typograhic painting&#39;, rather than &#39;typographic design&#39;.
    I cringe when students say they want to &#39;experiment&#39;... what they really
    mean is &#39;I want to do some David Carson stuff&#39;. Rebelling against rules
    doesn&#39;t neccessarily mean experimentation. <BR> <BR>There is much to learn
    from Carson though, seriously. His work raises important questions like: why do
    designers have to be so much in control? Are left-brain activities taking over
    our creativity and our ability to express? What do rules mean in typography and
    design? <BR> <BR>Yes, &#39;don&#39;t mistake legibility for communication&#39;...
    I still agree with that. But I also agree with Bringhurst: &#39;In a world rife
    with unsolicited messages, typography must often draw attention to itself before
    it will be read. Yet in order to be read, it must relinquish the attention it
    has drawn.&#39;'

  body: Carson is his own worst enemy. Remember the infamous spread, where he laid
    out an entire article in Zapf Dingbats? <BR> <BR>Ultimately, I feel as though
    Carson will be relegated to a footnote in graphic design history. While he occupied
    an important time in the history of our field, and at least at one point was probably
    the most imitated designer in the history of the craft, he&#39;s no Rand. I don&#39;t
    believe his work will stand the test of time. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, who
    cares? Is design the same as fine art?

    Carson a designer, but as Keith said, mor of a &#39;painter&#39;. <BR>A fine artists,
    who puts his OWN desires before the end users. Then there is the subject of the
    line between fine art and graphic design. I have always voiced the determining
    factor in this comparison is the addition of type. But, in the case of Carson,
    this rather twists my theory. Possibly communicaion -- not type? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.'

    can make vodou work in his everyday routine here are a few spreads from that book

  body: 'So I have a question: <BR>The staggered setting of the shark quote on the
    bottom page, I guess it&#39;s supposed to convey the feeling of a shark attack?
    I&#39;m not a surfer, plus I&#39;m too type-conscious, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m
    a good benchmark, but to me it doesn&#39;t; such a layout could just as easily
    convey dancing for example. More important seems to be the font choice: that font
    is too &#34;fun&#34;. An incised italic &#40;like maybe Octavian&#39;s&#41; I
    think would work much better. <BR> <BR>My point is that I&#39;m not a classicist,
    and I value intuition more than anything else &#40;my issue is with intent, and
    what contemporary society really needs - ie not artistes&#41;, but I have to point
    out something: shark attacks are not a new phenomenon, and it&#39;s probable that
    a &#34;classic&#34; font &#40;especially the stuff produced in Eastern Europe
    in the middle of the 20th century&#41; would work very well - and probably be
    better crafted as well. Craft is important for example to convey formal harmony.
    And you could say a shark attack is not a form of discord, but of high harmony.
    Human war is very discordious &#40;mostly because we use to much machinery: even
    a longbow is much less harmonious than a sword&#41;, so something like notCaslon
    is good for that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '&#62;Carson is his own worst enemy. Remember the &#62;infamous spread, where
    he laid out an entire &#62;article in Zapf Dingbats?  <BR> <BR>You know why he
    DID this? It had a reason, and a good one.  <BR> <BR>David is a tremendous artist,
    not necessarily bothered with conveying information,ergo not necessarily with
    typography in teh Tschicholdian or Morrison sense of the word, but rather with
    intuitive and emotional impact. Perfectly geared for the short attewntion span
    of the herewearenowentertainus-Generation of MTV, Carsons mid-period and later
    work is sometimes sparse, sometimes complex, very often strikingly beautiful,
    quite sometimes repetetive, and with commercial success and passing over from
    counter-culture to over-the-counter-culture. LIke McKean, you either like his
    style or you don&#39;t -- and a style it is, with Carson even narrower than with
    the multifacetted Mr. McKean, and although I have some trouble with his more commercial
    work, I really dig David and most of all the evolution his work has shown post
    PHASE-2. Even back in the 80s/90s, he was more about structure and IDEA and challenging
    the thinkinginsidetheboxmindset of many designers, shortly, he was a nicely nasty
    little mindfucker, and he still is. Supercially he&#39;s gotten a bit away from
    his pasting-type-in different-sizes-over-self-shot-pix, at least to some degree,
    and he&#39;s mostly post the phase of using the T26-font-of-the-week, but baby,
    mindfucking is still the thing he does and does pretty well. Plus, imo, he&#39;s
    a decent and nice guy despite the superstar-status and I cannot say that of all
    designers I&#39;ve personally met so far.  <BR> <BR>I still teach his work in
    my classes as a counterpoint to the idea that typography is about information,
    as one of MANY &#40;hello Cranbrock Academy of Art, hello Saville, hello Vaughan,
    hello Dirk Rudolph, hello Willy Fleckhaus hello Alex Branczyk, hello Weingart...
    and so on...&#41; examples that typography in many various forms is actually about
    conveying and manipulating emotion, at least when it&#39;s not just about tyesetting
    a book or so.  <BR> <BR>Personally, I&#39;ve found that a kind of quite German
    minimalism and engineering-kinda reduction suits me better, no matter how much
    I wanna do fucked-up stuff these days, it very often ends up being very simple
    and empty, but for me Carson is one of the examples what post-postmodern US-Design
    can be about. It&#39;s big, bold, carefree, emotional, fast and very Hollywood,
    very keen on the big effect. And to me, much as Pentagram is british &#40;funny,
    clever, absolutely-honest'

    <BR>Aeshetics is one thing, but forcing a subjective emotional response is not,

    was about dealing with clients. <BR> <BR>He said he had been waiting for the article
    for too long - they were about to go to print on that issue. The writer had spent
    maybe 10 minutes with the band and written a piece of crap. David took executive
    decision - he didn&#39;t want to print it - it was crap. It wasn&#39;t going to
    be seen by anyone else before press - so he layed it out in dingbats and passed
    it off as a &#34;artsy&#34; spread rather then actual content. <BR> <BR>He wasn&#39;t

    I think it was for NY Out or something. Anyway - he said he had been putting it

    sreaming for the cover...&#34;we need to cover david&#34; &#34;we&#39;re going
    to print&#34; Carson has said &#40;and he was telling us this in his lecture&#41;
    that he lied through his teeth, saying that he had it almost done. He&#39;ll send
    it over in an hour.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s when he ran to a drugstore - got a disposible
    camera, flung himself out the office window &#40;In London I beleive it was&#41;
    shot a pic of some other office windows, got the film developed , threw it on
    a scanner and sent the file to the NY magazine with a rationale saying that &#34;New

    on the pic and voila - bill the sucker. <BR> <BR>I useto buy all the intuitive
    stuff when I read 2nd sight...but after hearing him speak of how he&#39;s just
    trying to get to the beach and surf all day. &#40;which he did do for a Bank commercial....just
    used footage of him and friends surfing&#41; I really wonder if he&#39;s thinking
    at all. He knows he&#39;s big, he knows he can get away with murder....he was
    joking about it with us and then tried to justify why his work on McLuhan wasn&#39;t
    readable or ledgible.  <BR> <BR>We&#39;re talking about McLuhan frig - the man&#39;s

  body: Nice to see Dave hasn&#39;t changed his presentations, he told the very same
    story here in Germany almost six years back, IIRC. I think making that decision
    -- not liking the text, which he said was less about the artist and more about
    the backstage feeling anyway -- was a major step in which the design finally took
    active editorship, where content became nothing and Carsons own opinion became
    everything. Imo, it was the very Zenith of his Ray Gun work -- a brilliant, simple,
    anarchic and impertinent idea. he said that later-on many writer complained whe
    he DID NOT maim their text and made them illegible -- hey, David, didn&#39;t you
    like my story, you DID nothing to it :-&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Also, I think that the
    &#40;for the designer&#41; very simple act of changing a font rendering the text
    illegible and making it necessary to decode the Dingbats manually is a great thing.
    It doesn&#39;t even matter WHY he did it, imo... it just exemplifies a lot of
    the typography of those days, whether intended or not. Style over Content and
    all that. There is a reason, why people, when asked what Ray Gun is about don&#39;t
    think of a certain journalistic approach or editorial viewpoint of music, but
    of a visual style... NOT really a good thing for a serious magazine.  <BR> <BR>I
    have loads of problems with what David&#39;s style was all about, in terms of
    it being superficial and somewhat egodriven, but on the other hand his work was
    and still is more often than not often so full of energy and ideas and sparkling
    and a very nice &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;-ya-attitude I find myself loving it,
    even a decade later, when works of other people with quite a similar look feel
    stilted and dead.  <BR> <BR>Carson, harkening back to Dada and shitloads of other
    styles he ripped, was a great package of punk, with an immensive feeling for what
    just felt right on a printed page and a nice touch for improvisation. I never
    thought of him as a typographer or even a graphic designer but rather an artist
    who worked with the kind of material we designers happen to work with. Loads of
    people aped his superficial style, but almost no one got the fact that it never
    was about Style but about a personal way of expressing himself... and you can&#39;t
    ape that.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    a prime example of why accreditation among graphic designers is v. important.
    if you &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; with the words of McLuhan the same way you do
    the words of some kiddy punk band article you thought was crap, you should be
    nixed - your obviously not responsible enough and show no care for your clients.  <BR>
    <BR>Admittedly I&#39;m jealous that he can take such liberties, but I&#39;d perfer
    to see someone who actually cared about the profession do experimental work and
    gain credit for it. He may have beat down some boundaries, and we can all praise
    him and justify it any way we want. But, when the clients get ahold of this, and
    see how he was acting like a flake in front of them, laughing about it to the
    rest of his colleagues, I fear that the door will bounce back shut, locked, because
    of his loud mouth spurring disrespect, unprofessional actions and leading to more

  body: when i posted those spreads earlier, i really wasnt looking for a crit. anyway,
    there were no intentions for that layout to &#34;convey a shark attack.&#34; the
    book i made was from my 1st year in design school and the project was to make
    a fanzine where we had to create the subject and content &#40;at least 6000 words&#41;.
    We had less than a month to do this and a limit of 2 colors and 2 typefaces. Anyway,
    I was just posting to show the influence carson had on that particular piece..
    or at least in my opinion. <BR> <BR> Sure, I was no expert in design or typography,
    and still claim to be nowhere near the vicinity of that title. I thought at the
    time that it was a fairly decent piece as a whole, and growing up in a surftown
    and surfing all my life, felt i had the subject matter down. A local surfshop
    actually wanted to buy several copies and sell them at their shop. The book got
    me an A&#43; in the class &#40;which I hear are very hard to come by at my school,
    art center college of design, and the book was on display for a term in the gallery
    at my school&#41;. I&#39;ll be the first to admit this doesnt mean a thing and
    also that i have a lot to learn. I&#39;m getting off track here sorry.  <BR> <BR>Because
    I was only allowed 2 typefaces &#40;1 of them being mrs. eaves for the body..
    which I felt was easy to read and gave me a sort of spell book type of feeling
    without being too obvious.. which related to vodou&#41;. The other typeface came
    from research, which consisted of going through my wardrobe.. and looking at all
    my surf shirts and going to surf shops. I wasnt looking for a classic feel of
    harmony or discord or whatever you were mentioning before, but a font that would
    work throughout the book that related to my subect matter... surfing and my writing
    style. As a student, my typeface collection is limited as well as my knowledge
    of all the typefaces available. That being said, its the best I could do at the
    time, and I am still happy with the outcome.  <BR> <BR>Back to Carson... whether
    we feel his work is amazing, or we think its a disgrace, we must remeber that
    he is more famous than most of us will ever hope to be. He must have been doing
    something right, no? <BR> <BR>&#62;Which just means you&#39;re not the target
    demographic. Dude. <BR> <BR>I think this is the point here &#40;ignoring the stereotype
    you&#39;ve just imposed on the entire surfing community&#41; is that he DID indeed
    hit his target demographic. Every surfer I knew loved his work and I feel that
    as a designer, thats one of the most important goals &#40;along with doing something
    you enjoy and put your heart into&#41;. Carson obviously achieved both and basically
    created a revolution in the design world &#40;for better or for worse&#41;. To
    that I must tip my hat wheter I enjoy his work or not.
