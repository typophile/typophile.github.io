body: "Last week I downloaded a copy of the Iraq Report from this Web site: http://www.usip.org\r\n\r\nUpon
  opening the document, I noticed right away that the text was set in a sans serif
  face. I opened the doc in Acrobat Professional, highlighted some text, and checked
  the properties. Sure enough, the typeface was supposed to be Times New Roman MS.
  Since the fonts were substituted, all bold and other shifts in weight were ignored.
  I contacted the Web site's webmaster about 5 days ago, making a case for embedding
  the fonts and reposting the document. \r\n\r\nI just got an email back with the
  report attached and a thanks for my concern.\r\n\r\nWell, the same problem exists
  in this file as well. \r\n\r\nPlease forgive my naivete on the matter, but is this
  a problem involving their lack of embedding, or is it a font file format issues?
  I really don't know what format TNR-MS is, but I am on a Mac, so i'm wondering if
  the issue really is about compatability.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any thoughts on this
  that would clear things up for me I would really appreciate the help. "

    it wasn't \"Times New Roman PS\"? \r\n\r\nIn general I think TNR is not embedded
    by default, but I'm no expert.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

  body: "Thanks!! This is a normal version of the document!\r\n\r\nI see in your screen
    shot that it says \"Actual Font: Adobe Sans MM\"\r\n\r\nIn the version you posted,
    the same area says \"Actual Font: Adobe Serif MM\"\r\n\r\nAnbody have any idea
    why there's a difference? I'm guessing this is the root cause of the issue."
