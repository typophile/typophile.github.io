    House - BBC Headquarters in London&#93; are of Ariel and Prospero, characters
    from Shakespeare&#39;s The Tempest. They are among the most famous works by the
    British sculptor and designer Eric Gill.  <BR> <BR>Rumour has it that on its initial
    inspection by the BBC&#39;s governors, they demanded that several inches be lopped
    off the manhood of the sprite Ariel.  <BR> <BR>Ariel was chosen as something of
    joke on the word aerial. But Gill himself was not completely amused by the joke,
    saying: &#34;Comic, though, the BBC kidding itself that it may be likened to a
    prince putting the world to rights and its bally apparatus likened to a sort of
    heavenly spire.&#34;  <BR> <BR>In a piece of historial neatness, the corporation
    now uniformly uses a typeface designed by Gill - Gill Sans - as its house style...&#34; '
