body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI edit a university calendar, which is nothing like a regular calendar;
  it's a 600+ page book with our rules and regulations and course descriptions. Pretty
  dense stuff. Right now we are using Arial Narrow at 9/10pt because, well, we always
  have, and it seemed to be good for cramming maximum text into minimum space. Recently,
  however, we changed from an ancient version of Word Perfect to InDesign, and now
  I am considering suggesting a font change as well. \r\n\r\nWhat font would you suggest
  that would be as efficient with space and readable? And, considering this is for
  company use and that at least two of us need to have the font on our computers,
  how does licensing work? (I have no experience with buying/licensing fonts.)\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your suggestions,\r\nKristina"

  body: "One thing you should keep in mind here, something sort of counter-intuitive,
    is that narrow fonts aren't always/necessarily more economical (except for single
    lines). This is because wide fonts can be set at a smaller point size, maintaining
    apparent size (compared to a narrow font set larger), and saving space vertically.
    This is especially true if you have a lot of paragraph breaks (which eat up the
    potential savings of narrow fonts). Another thing is that serif fonts can actually
    be set tighter (I mean stem-to-stem, and wordspace) while maintaining readability
    (not to mention their inherent readability advantage).\r\n\r\nTry Parable:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/parable/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    cuz it's always been like that. Eventually no one remembers the original reasons

    fun to read. I'd tried putting in a different serif font (warnock pro, I like)
    at 8/10 rather than 9/10 but, although I found it way clearer and loved the extra

    typeface you choose. Imagine, you have to design over 600 pages with a typeface.
    If you choose one you never tested, Is he readable, is she legibile, Is she has
    italic, bold or black if you need it? Do you like the one you choose, do you enjoy

  body: "Hi Kristina,\r\n\r\nYou refer to Warnock Pro as \"a bit on the small side\".
    What do you mean? If you mean the x-height/Cap ratio is great, that could be true.
    However, Warnock comes in 4 different size variants. If you have the smallest
    version, you have a set of fonts for all kinds of print work that are engineered
    to work at small sizes. I have to echo Hrant's point about relative size; condensed
    faces take up less room and therefore are smaller.... Wider faces can be set smaller
    and still be readable. So it may not be useful to focus on condensed designs.
    \r\n\r\nThe features you require are economy, clarity, comfort for the reader,
    and several weights/styles so you can manage the hierarchy of info that is no
    doubt crammed into this calendar book. For that, you could pick any sturdy text
    family; Parable is quite nice, there's also Arnhem or Fresco from Ourtype.be,
    or Absara Serif and Sans, Clifford (smaller sizes)  from FontShop, Proforma (as
    mentioned earlier), Farnham, Miller, Prensa and Whitman from FontBureau, and Legacy
    superfamily, Albertina, Mentor superfamily, and Laurentian from fonts.com. Oh,
    and the Freight megafamily from Joshua Darden. \r\n\r\nConsidering all the nice
    fonts that came with CS2, you have some pretty robust options there you can test
    out without any expense, to see which conserves the most space. I suggest you
    set your sample pages in Minion, Warnock, Chaparral, and if you chose this option,
    Garamond Premier Pro Text and Caption sizes. All of those are built for heavy
    text use at small sizes. You might be able to reduce your type size to 7 or 8
    and not lose any reading comfort. Minion especially performs well when tracked
    and set with comfortable linespacing down to 7 or 8 points. \r\n\r\nAt the very
    least, I hope you switch from Arial Narrow to something less torturous. Given
    your current options it would be unethical not to.   ;D"

  body: "Hi Grossgrove,\r\n\r\nThank you for the suggestions, I really appreciate
    the input. \r\n\r\nI have gone through pretty much all of the serif fonts in CS2,
    and somehow even the ones I like don't quite do it. Some seem big at 9pt for a
    10pt leading, but too small at 8pt. Others just seem inappropriate. I don't yet
    have a better typographical vocabulary than that, unfortunately. \r\n\r\nWarnock
    was pretty good, but the people in my office who wear glasses thought the Arial
    Narrow was more readable than Warnock... go figure. I like that Parable is easy
    to read at 7 pt -- 8 pt is almost too big. And I like its open feel. \r\n \r\nPerhaps
    after readability the defining factor is the feel I want the publication to have.
    It's often thought of as an academic legal doorstopper that no one reads, and
    it's printed on something close to newsprint, but not as thin. I'd like the font
    to be readable and liven up the publication somewhat, even minutely. \r\n\r\nI'm
    having difficulty finding a sans serif for the headers and subheaders. I don't
    know which ones go well together. For now I've matched Parable with Myriad Pro.
    Something about the flare (like at the base of the uppercase M) seems right, but
    I could be way off.\r\n \r\nI'm not looking for a condensed font per se. I'm trying
    to bridge the need to not add too many pages to the book and the need for readability
    (I really need something that will work with the 10 pt leading). I know very little
    about typography, but I'm learning. \r\n\r\nI'm prepared to compromise somewhere
    because I may not have a choice, but overall I'm going for improvement. The fact
    that this publication has persisted in this format for so long speaks volumes
    about where the priority has been placed. Extra pages cost money...    \r\n\r\nI
    will check out the other fonts you've listed. Thanks again for the input. I'm
    beginning to feel like I've been staring at the project for too long. \r\n\r\nKristina."

  body: "Kristina,\r\n\r\nGood news: If 8 is too small, and 9 is too large, InDesign
    will give you any fractional size between. Customize it to 8.4 if that feels right.
    But I wonder why you need to stick to 10 point leading? Is there already an InDesign
    template you're working from? \r\n\r\nI ask, because like the type size, leading
    is also finely adjustable in InDesign. When setting text, the combination of typeface,
    size, tracking, leading and column width all work together to produce blocks of
    text that are more or less comfortable and economical of space. Especially when
    switching from a condensed sans to a serif, the overall look will be very different;
    be wary of the impressions of people who are used to looking at this document.
    \r\n\r\nI do have some experience with typography, and from the type specs you've
    named, I can say very confidently that with a careful revision of typeface, size,
    and leading, you should be able to save paper and improve the feel of the document.
    \ \r\n\r\nI just spent a few minutes comparing Minion, Utopia, Warnock, Georgia,
    Clifford, and Chaparral to Arial Narrow. To get the same column length, I had
    to change both the type size and the leading; Utopia ended up smallest at 7.5
    on 10, and with a ratio like that, you end up with much more comfortable leading,
    which is also where you could realize a savings in pages. If you set Utopia at
    7.5 on 9.5, the leading is still more comfortable, and you can fit more lines,
    which equals less paper. A major influence on the readability of your document
    is line spacing, and frankly I found Arial Narrow 9/10 pretty cramped. I think
    you have a great deal of leeway to improve your document; I suspect that if you
    showed these comparative samples to 100 students and staff none of them would
    pick Arial. If you like, I will forward the PDF to you. \r\n\r\nA Sans you could
    consider for heads is Cachet by Dave Farey. It's also softened, and square, like
    Parable."

    the leading and font size are both adjustable -- the only reason I wanted to stay
    with 10pt is that it is set at 10 (except for where it isn't.. what a mess!) --
    and already feels cramped. I couldn't imagine the text being legible at anything

    about the titles in the margins, and probably align them with the first line of
    text because sometimes they appear where there is no dividing rule.\r\n\r\nYour
    comment #2 -- I did this based on Bringhurst and Lee who suggest it as a way of
    preventing widows and orphans. They both say it is preferable to fall a line short
    or a line long (on an entire spread) rather than stretch the leading or add extra
    space between paragraphs. I try to play with the text wrap to add or save a line,
    but in some cases nothing seems to work. \r\n\r\nWidow/orphan control is one of
    our major problems, and the main argument my colleague has presented for not aligning
    the text to a baseline grid. So if you have any other solutions, I'd really appreciate
    hearing them -- I've run out. However, based on Bringhurst, I feel confident that
    it is  not as bad to drop or add a line as it is to mess with the leading and
    start feathering (which is what we'd been doing). \r\n\r\nThanks again; it's good
