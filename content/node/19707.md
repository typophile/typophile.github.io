body: "Last week, the typography team at Target was asked to give a presentation to
  a segment of the corporation. We had a lot of fun and wonderful feedback from our
  co-workers. It was a great way to show the unitiated what a real-life typesetter/typographer
  does. I thought I'd share just a portion of our presentation here. We took our lead
  from Ellen Lupton's \"Type Crimes\" concept from her <a href=\"http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/index.htm\">Thinking
  with Type</a> book. \r\n\r\nYou can see some of the slides we created <a href=\"http://ravenmn-typographypowerpoint.buzznet.com/user/photos/\"><strong>here</strong></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: And I'm sure that it was a powerpoint presentation that Tufte would be proud
    of. I wonder if target would have appreciated Tschichold's description of orphans
    & widows... (whores' children & cobblers' apprentices). I don't remember which
    was which, but you can use your imagination!
