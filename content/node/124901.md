body: "The closest I could find is this font: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/indenture-english-penman/\r\n\r\n\r\nbut
  if you look closer the \"W\" is different and I'm looking for the \"W\" which is
  exactly like the one in the logo. The one that I found \"Indenture English penman\"
  has opposite thicker stroke and different bottom crotches of the \"W\" is different.
  \r\n\r\nSo any help are appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/the-whisper-withinsize_6380.png]"
