body: Hello everybody, this is my first contact and I would like to have your critique
  for a font i started to work on. I applied the characters on the clich&eacute;  phrase
  &#34;the brown fox...&#34; and to a logo &#40;the logo is fiction, just to try the
  types&#41;. For the moment i have designed just the lowercase, and in the future
  i will plus greek letters &#40;i am from Greece&#41;. <BR>I would appreciate it
  if you could give me your views plus I would be greatfull to receive some methodological
  informations on how to develop my work. <BR> <BR>thank you <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: ' some good things are happening here. i like the descender on the &#39;h&#39;,
    but it feels heavy, perhaps angle/corner it such as &#39;f&#39; and &#39;k&#39;,
    but in the direction of the latter. does the &#39;e&#39; or &#39;z&#39; feel weird?
    hmmm '

  body: ' 1. v is a little too close to u for my liking. <BR>2. serifs seem to have
    2 variations..slabbing and spiked - any reason? <BR>3. and like John said decenders
    - cut them all or don&#39;t cut at all. '

  body: ' Thank you John for your notices, I overlooked on the letters you mentioned
    and i think you are right. So, i expanded a little bit the horizontal stems of
    &#34;e&#34; and I applied the diagonal cut edge on the descender of &#34;h&#34;.
    The problem is still with &#34;z&#34; and is called &#34;diagonal stem&#34;...you
    see in none of the types i used diagonal stems, so i tried to keep a vertical
    stem for &#34;z&#34;, too. To be honest, now that i used it i like it and i think
    it fits between the neighbooring types, but still there are no other angled stems
    around, so is this convinient? I tried also a &#34;z&#34; with descender, but
    maybe this is too strange and i want to know if it is legible to you, beyond any
    historical taboos...thanks again for your advices <BR> <BR>...i just read your
    notes Tanya, i will try them later. <BR> <BR>\image-&#40;sample2&#41; '

    is missing the sharp point an '
