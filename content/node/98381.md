  body: Step back and try to see the structure of the letter, rather than the two
    outlines. This should give you an indication of where the problem is, and what
    needs to be adjusted. Remember, when we perceive letters in text we perceive the
    structure, not the outlines.

  body: "John, your \"structure\" might be understood as \"expanded skeleton\" (which
    I feel is irrelevant). But even if you mean structure in terms of black bodies,
    I think it's dangerous to think in those terms; to me it's all about notan. So
    yes, don't look at the two outlines... but that's because it's not two outlines;
    in a way it's actually one -potentially complex- outline; or maybe no \"outline\"
    at all... To me it all boils down to the \"total\" black/white border (which even
    exceeds the letter boundary).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I say, if you don't know it must be an o, for only the first counter encounter
    should raise such a fundamental inside outside question. If it is the o, then
    it depends entirely on what you want the rest of the letters to look like.

  body: "Everyone is telling you: your question can't we answered in the abstract,
    as it depends on the context of a design. In other words it's the wrong question
    to ask if you want to improve a design. \r\n\r\nA good new typeface has: A. a
    good design idea--something it's trying to do that makes design sense; B. It is
    carried out consistently; C. It is carried out well artistically. Often you don't
    know whether your design idea is good\u2014or whether you can make it good\u2014until
    you try B. and C. \r\n\r\nInside and outside curves and how they relate should
    flow out of your design idea. And that can only be judged in the context of, say
    half or more of the alphabet (eg hamburgerfontsiv). Then you can ask: was this
    a good design idea? Should it be changed, or is some of the execution flawed that
    I should fix before going on? If some characters are flawed, how? \r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: 'p.s. As you are troubled by the 4, I should say: numbers follow different
    rules than the latin alphabet, but they also have to work together with the alphabet,
    so they''re a special challenge. Perhaps others can be more helpful with general
    guidelines, but for a start: study a variety of numbers styles and their associated
    alphabets. '

  body: What if you're just making a single glyph and thus have nothing to compare
    it to?  I just think this is an interesting question.  Kind of like, if you are
    at a T intersection somewhere, and are completely lost, and have no landmarks
    to go by, do you turn right or left?  There's no correct answer, which is why
    I think it is so interesting.  I wasn't really looking for help with anything
    in particular, but I do appreciate it.

  body: "Hrant: <em>your \"structure\" might be understood as \"expanded skeleton\"
    </em>\r\n\r\nWhich would be a mistake. If I'd meant skeleton, I would have said
    skeleton. What I am talking about might be considered the opposite of an expanded
    skeleton: a perceptual shape within the black. It is easy to see how this shape
    is perceptually subject to the relationship of opposing outlines, without falling
    back on a notion of these as expansions of a skeleton. As I've pointed out in
    the past, Legato possesses a strong sense of structure that is not reducible to
    a skeleton through manipulation of the outlines, which would be the case for skeleton
    expansion (or stroking).\r\n\r\n<em>To me it all boils down to the \"total\" black/white
    border</em>\r\n\r\nIt cannot boil down to that in the case of text type at typical
    sizes, because at those sizes we don't perceive the borders, we perceive the shapes."
