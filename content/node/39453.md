  all the visual materials for a small dental practice. The target audience is middle-aged,
  upper-middle class, and more on the rural side (the location is a smallish town
  in the Texas hill country which nevertheless sees a number of transplants from the
  larger metropolitan areas). \r\n\r\nMy goal is to stay away from typical color schemes
  for this sort of stuff (a regrettable blend of pastels, my research tells me) and
  modernism in general. I want inviting and open and un-designed looking. I think
  my choice of fonts will go a long way towards setting the appropriate tone.\r\n\r\nI
  played around with Avenir, but it was a little too geometric. Kievit is along the
  lines of what I'm looking for, very clean and unmannered but still with some solidity.
  I'm not sold that it's the right one. Any suggestions in the same vein? Some serif
  companion suggestions would also be great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to Stephan H:
  I welcome your font-pimping even if your suggestions aren't that close to my brief.
  Rock on."

  body: If you can explain more about why FF Kievit isn't working for you, we can
    be more helpful with alternatives. You may like the newer <a href="http://typographica.org/001103.php#milo-fonts">FF
    Milo</a> from the same designer. It's got a larger x-height, a little more friendly.

  body: "Not off-base at all, Eben. Freight is fantastic, just the sort of thing I'm
    looking for.\r\n\r\nStephen, I don't think Kievit has a deficiency as much as
    I haven't seen enough good alternatives to make a proper comparison. If anything,
    Kievit might be a just a little too straightlaced. This may or many not help,
    but my client commented on Avenir looking too \"stretched,\" which I took to mean
    they preferred a larger x-height and a more vertical shape to the letterforms.\r\n\r\nFF
    Milo is really nice, I think the counters are a little bit too open for me. Something
    about that makes me want to use it for a daycare center or nonprofit. Don't know
    why. Another one that I really, really like is Nexus, but it is a touch too quirky
    this time (Dear Martin Majoor, I will spec that font for a project if it kills
    me)."

  body: You might dig <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/mundo_sans/">Mundo
    Sans</a> then. I think it's at a nice midpoint between Kievit and Milo.
