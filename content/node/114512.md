  format?\r\n2. How many typefaces did he fashion with or without Tom Carnase?\r\n\r\nFind
  a rough list of his work : <em>Avant Garde Gothic, Lubalin Graph, Serif Gothic,
  Ronda, Didi</em>. \r\nAre there anymore typefaces?\r\n\r\n3. How do you define the
  style of Herb Lubalin and what's his artistical leaning?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "There\u2019s this story about Alexandre Wollner visiting Herb Lubalin in
    New York. He says: \r\n\r\n<em>H. Lubalin had this three-\uFB02oor office in N.Y.
    The main room was as big as Alexandre Wollner\u2019s house with tables covered
    with sweets and chocolates. Wollner asked him what the room was for and how he
    managed all the luxury when he (Wollner) back in Sao Paulo couldn\u2019t even
    dream of having such an adequate room. He replied: \u201CI\u2019m going to tell
    you a secret: on the \uFB01rst \uFB02oor there\u2019s a room full of people working,
    but they only do retail down there, which I don\u2019t show to anyone and which
    doesn\u2019t appear in any book. We make a lot of money there. On the 2nd \uFB02oor
    we produce publications of a slightly higher level: some adverts, but mostly magazine
    page spreads, medical pamphletes, and these make reasonable money. I don\u2019t
    publish this stuff anywhere either. Then there is this room here where I do the
    things you see; the Avant Garde alphabet, Eros magazine etc. These don\u2019t
    bring in a dime, they just cost money. It\u2019s the \uFB01rst \uFB02oor that
    sustains the other two.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nThe story is from Alexandre Wollner
    published by CosacNaify in Brazil (a project by Andre Stolarski)"

    I've worked for. They need some steady clients that provide a constant flow of
    income, even if the work is mundane. It isn't shown in the portfolio, but it pays
    the bills."

  body: "On the digital market, only four fonts are available with the original names:
    \r\n<em>Avant Garde Gothic, Lubalin Graph, Serif Gothic, Ronda</em>.\r\n<em>Avant
    Garde Gothic</em> was available in its complete form with stylistic sets in the
    previous decade only.\r\n\r\nI read that Lubalin produced <em>ITC Fat Face Black</em>.
    Nick Curtis reproduced it under the name of <em><strong>Pudgy Puss NF</strong></em>.\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/pudgy-puss-nf/]]\r\n\r\nI
    discovered the modern face <em>ITC Didi</em> by chance at [[http://fontsinuse.com|Fonts
    in Use]]. \r\n[[http://fontsinuse.com/uses/6071/george-lois-website]]\r\n\r\nThe
    font is not available on digital format with that name but designer Jason Anthony
    Walcott reproduced it under the name <em><strong>Domani CP</strong></em>.\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/counterpoint/domani-cp/]]\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if there are other fonts from Lubalin's output with alternate identities."
