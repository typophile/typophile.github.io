  body: If your newsletter looks a little gray and drab, you can instantly juice it
    up simply by using a strong, heavy, sans serif typeface for your headlines and
    subheads. Not Helvetica. The Helvetica (or Arial) that came with your computer
    isn't bold enough to create a strong contrast. Invest in a sans serif family that
    includes a heavy black version as well as a light version (such as Eurostile,
    Formata, Syntax, Frutiger, or Myriad). Use that heavy black for your headlines
    and pull-quotes and you'll be amazed at the difference.

    a common enough font to figure out anyway, but a wefont takes less than a second
