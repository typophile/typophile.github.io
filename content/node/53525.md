  great face to use for body copy but at bigger sizes it isn't really working (despite
  Bookman being designed for use as a display face, according to Wikipedia). The title
  page just doesn't look right. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on a book written in the
  1890's so if anyone has any good ideas of a display face or wood type inspired faces
  that might work well with Bookman I'd love to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  \r\n\r\nJono"

    was thinking more along the lines of a chunky wood type face, I might have to
    hit the letterpress department at university!\r\n\r\nThanks hrant \r\n\r\nJono"
