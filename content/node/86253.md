  for an exact match of the font. \r\nThis original label was produced in the late
  60's, early 70s if that helps? I am thinking a version of Futura, but I don't seem
  to have the exact version, can anyone help? \r\nThanks for for your interest and
  time in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jhwilson_5233.JPG]"

    does look close though, but will have to customise the M's. \r\n\r\nThanks."
