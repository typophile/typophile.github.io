  to solving this riddle: all of MK's books, when under his control,  seem to be set
  in the same typefacte. Also, in his critical work Testaments betrayed, he mentions
  how critical typeface should be for an author, and how Kafka's express wishes for
  a tall typeface were ignored by publishers seeking to cram as many words onto the
  page as possible.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for helping!\r\n\r\nBill\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture_4491.JPG]"

    The publisher may have even put a slight condense on it to cut down the amount
    of pages?
