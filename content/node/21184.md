  dead. But im in situation where my client already got license for it, and he insist
  in using it. So I decided to combine it with serif font. My idea is to make the
  serif main, and helvetica secondary one.\r\n\r\nI would be very grateful for any
  advice and especially tips for serif font which will work well with helvetica. thanks
  in advance.."

  body: Unlike color combinations that can benefit from subtle contrast, typeface
    changes need to be obvious - I'd say almost all serif typefaces could be mixed
    with Helvetica; try ITC Veljovic for instance.

    hell. \r\n\r\nI'm guessing the client's taste runs towards the obvious, so you
    could try Times Roman. Or if you're feeling adventurous, Palatino. Garamond is
    another great default text face that springs to mind.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I disagree Helvetica is dead. Quite far from it. It's just the font many
    love to hate.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, it is a staple font in signage applications
    (even though other faces like Frutiger are often more suited to the purpose).
    Lots of government and military post signs specifically mandate its use. If they
    switch it will be to something more hated: Arial. Our sign company made a main
    entry sign for an Air Force base featuring chrome Arial Black letters.\r\n\r\nHelvetica
    Neue is very popular these days. I see the extended weights of it used all the
    time in various types of advertising.\r\n\r\nTo get back to topic, what's a good
    serif font that goes with Helvetica? I think Berthold's version of Baskerville
    looks good with it. Utopia isn't bad either."

    would not use an old style, let alone a calligraphic old style with Helvetica,
    or with Univers, or with any other neo-grotesque sans, for that matter. \r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion, Amts-Antiqua (now available from Bitstream as Century 725) would make
    for a much better combination with Helvetica:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Madison-Antiqua_4028.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    general, the Century-style moderns/ionics could work pretty well with the neo-grotesques,
    e.g., ITC Century:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITC_Century_4665.png]\r\n\r\nAn
    oval-based slab-serif, either bracketed, or unbracketed, might work nicely with
    Helvetica, e.g., Egyptienne F:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Egyptienne_F_4312.png]\r\n\r\nor
    Glypha:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Glypha_5636.png]\r\n\r\nIf you
    absolutely insist on using an old-style, or a transitional serif, I think those
    whose proportions are, again, oval-based (not circle-based), might make more sense,
    e.g., ITC Slimbach:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Utopia_6649.png]\r\n\r\nor
    Utopia:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Slimbach_3499.png]\r\n\r\nor Miller:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Miller_5641.png]"

    say here and re-read Bringhurst (2nd edition) pages 96-98 and I stand (or sit)
    corrected; I was too busy having a swipe at the client and the mindset that insists
    on Helve, rather than concentrating on the shapes of the letters.\r\n\r\n<cite>6.5.5
    Pair serifed and unserifed faces on the basis of their inner structure </cite>\r\n\r\nHe
    recommends Haas Clarendon. Perhaps any of the legibility group faces would work,

    Helvetica, for example, on a prestigious bespoke brand or client that definitely

    can do better than that... <cite> Helvetica is the freeze-dried instant mashed

  body: "The important thing in matching types is to get them looking like they are
    both set to the same specs.\r\n\r\nBy this I mean that one should not appear more
    condensed than the other, or relatively tracked out. The x-height should also
    be considered, as should ascender-to-cap height. \r\n\r\nif you don't take care
    of all these correspondences, your pairing will look \"off\". For instance, in
    Maxim's selection, Egyptienne is too wide, and Slimbach too narrow. (Although
    these things can be fixed by applying tracking and scaling, such distortions can
    be problematic, hard to police in a production environment.)\r\n\r\nDon't forget
    figure style: your matching face should have 3/4 height tabular lining figures,
    like Helvetica.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to the above, you can choose
    a partner that is quite different, such as Garamond. So, either have close harmony,
    or pointed contrast -- but avoid faces which fall between these two stools. \r\n\r\n"
