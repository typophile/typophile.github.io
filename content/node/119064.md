  body: "I traced out my own sample for some of the letters. (Kerning be danged.)
    Not much was left of the R so I guessed around.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/airport_4488.jpg]\r\nThis
    led me to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/purista/|Purista]]. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/purista/bold/|Purista
    Bold]] comes close for some letterforms. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/airport_5950.gif]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/cartella-nf/regular/|Cartella
    NF Regular]] also has a few similar letterforms.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/airport_6128.gif]\r\nI
    also like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/black/|Interstate
    Black]] for this."

    like the _S_ in Caracas, already suggested by Kevin, but perhaps a weight between
    Medium\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaracasMedInUse_5381.gif] and Demi
    Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaracasDemiBoldInUse_3532.gif] \r\nwould
    be a better fit?\r\nClearly there is no single font out of the box that fits all
    of the letters. I like the _M_ and other letters in Purista Bold  and Cartella
    NF Regular, suggested by Rob. If I had to choose a single font as a somewhat similar
    match, and could overlook the _S_, I would use either of these ones.\r\nTo get
    a proper match it would be necessary to to make some sort of Frankenfont of assembled
    letters, or do editing.\r\nDon"
