  of the advertisements supporting the publication are from indie type foundries.\r\nThis
  is an issue all about type (except for some of the book reviews), but usually most
  of the ads are for type anyway.\r\nIs it my imagination and it\u2019s always been
  that way, or has this skewed the editorial content to type, and history (which is
  a big part of serious typography).\r\n**\r\nGoing a step further, are there a greater
  number of books about typography being published now relative to graphic design
  books in general, than there were in the past?"

    if there's more than in the past, but have noticed plenty of attention paid to
    type of late, such as Computer Arts' typography edition and loads of smaller publications
    popping up.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Slanted yet, the link above directs to
    their newest edition with a focus on slab serifs!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nNathaniel"

    me too, especially since the rise of Adobe software going through educational
    institutions ...there's a new gen coming on.\r\n\r\nI really started noticing
    the attention because of all of that bespoke letter that was/is showing up on
    mag covers ...FRONT mag being one of my favs of course. And ya SLANTED is dope.
    There's a bunch now just killin' it.\r\n\r\nI regularly check in http://nascapas.blogspot.ca/
    to get my fix on what's happening on mag covers. But nothing beats a trip over
    to the my local magazine store ya.\r\n\r\nn."

    would be when the indie type companies tire of placing their ads. I know I'm growing
    tired of it. I wonder who else is."

  body: "Eye has been a truly fundamental publication in developing my increasing
    interest and passion for letters (and typefaces), and it\u2019s just great to
    see an issue largely devoted to type (and Monotype history!).\r\nI used to drop
    my subscriptions in the late 1990s, when the magazine became too \u201Cintellectually
    design oriented\u201D, so to speak, and I\u2019m really glad to read this: I\u2019d
    love to have this issue!\r\n\r\n@.00: What are you talking about, addressing Eye
    as \"these publications\"?"

    publications\" = Design Publications AKA design rags. HOW, Print, Creative Review,
    etc.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time these rags were filled with stock photo ads and paper
    ads. Now the major advertisers are type companies.\r\n\r\nThe stock ads and the
    paper ads are gone, most likely because they decided they were no longer reaching
    their market.\r\n\r\nIf and when the type ads go what will these publications
    do for revenue?"

    are mostly on the internet these days. The same may apply to paper companies,
    plus I imagine their business is declining as more and more communication is done
    via the web, email, PDFs, etc."

  body: "@.00: I think it makes little sense to generalize as such. Eye covered many
    topics which were barely touched by HOW and Print. Don\u2019t know Creative Review,
    but Eye was an outstanding magazine.\r\nSurely they do not depend merely on ads
    from type producers, I\u2019m pretty sure they have ways to market and sell the
    magazine. Advertisement in some cases is not needed."

    in the magazine business.\r\n\r\nEye is Eye, just another design magazine, different
    then the others but quite the same as well. \r\nI've run ads in all of them, I'm
    deciding whether to continue or not."

  body: "My theory is that designology tends towards type, as it provides objectively
    manageable markers for learned discussion about culture, history, economics, politics
    and technology.\r\n\r\nThe mash-up of post-modernism, for instance, is well demonstrated
    by architecture, of course, but also by types such as Fudoni and Dead History
    (now in the MoMA collection).\r\n\r\nAnd of course, everyone wants to know about
    Nazi fonts.\r\n\r\nBasing designology on type is an alternative to the Great Man
    narrative.\r\n\r\nAnd now, scientists want to get in on the act, with their measurements
    of readability as a key to brain function. Kevin Larson has written for Eye.  "
