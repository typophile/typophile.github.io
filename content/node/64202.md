  to use that font as the one that shows up in the text entry box in the metrics and
  preview windows. Of course it happens to be a font that is uneadable at small sizes
  :o)\r\n\r\nOne day I'll figure out why it does this but in the mean time, it's not
  really a problem for me - I just uinistall it to keep working in Fontlab.  It just
  amused me and I thought I share. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
