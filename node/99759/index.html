<blockquote>I believe that the only commercial versions were rip-offs of the free Black Chancery</blockquote>

I'm sure that does happen, and it could certainly be the case here. I guess the question is: what's worse, tricking a large number of users who like a cheesy cheap font out of some money, or harming an individual type designer - but also indirectly type design in general? Probably they're about equally bad.

And Dick's flippant, subversive reply wasn't so hot either.

2. Dafont can be acceptable, it's just rare. And even if a given font of theirs isn't plagiarized you should always add a disclaimer that the quality is super low so users don't pay for it later.
3. The above is what I call being friendly.
4. Your answer was subversive because you co-opted my line of inquiry.
5. People can go kill kids in a school - don't help them. And better not to bring up ignorance.

		<div class="commentbody">hrant- You object, out of hand, sight unseen, uninvestigated, to any ID response that mentions a free font. Given the general population here in Typophile, I think that before assailing such responses, you should perform your own due diligence instead of your automatic "if it's free it's probably a clone" (read: "criminally pirated").  I would think that most posters first suggest commercial fonts from reputable sources.

There are many free things in life that are either unique or superior to commercial offerings. Here in Southern California, local newspapers such as Los Angeles' Downtown News certainly have no impact on the sales of the Los Angeles Times. There is a clear place and audience for both. So it is with fonts and almost everything else.

In every case I restrict myself to "probable cause". In this case I actually do sort of remember seeing a commercial font that looks like that. I could be wrong, and as I admitted the commercial one could be a copy of a free one! But it's never vindictiveness that I'm acting on.

<blockquote>I would think that most posters first suggest commercial fonts from reputable sources.</blockquote>

I mostly agree. I think the real problem is that the people asking are generally not so honorable, and many people helping them don't want to face that reality. So it's not that free fonts are being suggested (there are indeed some good ones, that are not plagiarized) it's that:
- Plagiarized fonts are often suggested (often unknowingly, but often a result of not caring to check).
- The commercial fonts being suggested are usually being pirated. Now, I admit there's no Proof of that. But <em>at least</em> when all the signs are there (especially when there's an admission!) people should confront that.

In the end, the right people and things aren't being helped (in my view).

Wishful thinking is no substitute for good judgement.
