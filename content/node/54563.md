  know why, but when I'm drawing something it creates strange shapes with points that
  I didn\xB4t drew.\r\nA very strange thing. I already uninstall and install again
  the program. It worked fine until this weekend...\r\nPlease help me! I really appreciate
  it!"

    universal binary, so when Rosetta hiccups Fontlab crashes.\r\n\r\nSet your auto-save
    to every minute. Fontlab autosaves to files in the preferences directory and not
    to your working files, so don\u2019t worry about it saving and crashing and simultaneously."

  body: I get those weird shapes all the time, but undo usually fixes things. What
    really drives me crazy is the tendency of Fontlab to mash overlapping fonts together
    during a copy/paste, because that forces me to do multiple copy/paste or use components,
    and that can really slow things down.

    usually fixes things.</em>\r\nThis probably has to do with the way FL manages
    undo (it is: one thread by glyph, so as, after some glyph jumps, one increases
    geometrically undo memory usage) through multiple dynamic pointers; eventually,
    it may occur that, when you try to go back i.e. by typing a fast keystroke, you
    \u201Ccatch\u201D FL \u2014which is modestly slow due to its complexity\u2014
    performing another background task; that's why you can fix it \u2014actually,
    not exactly a bug, but an undesired undoable behavior\u2014 by repeating the command:
    after recovering its \u201Cconscious\u201D, FL finishes all pending tasks and
    brings you where you wanted to.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>\r\n"

    undo to the point where the outline looks okay. Then select the entire path, cut
    and then paste. This seems to always clear up erratic path behavior for me.\r\n\r\nI
    also have a habit of saving frequently. I don't trust auto-save because it may
    save the font in an undesirable condition, like right after I've done something
    I shouldn't have to the font. I also use the option to save .bak files, so I can
    always roll back one version. Failing that, TimeMachine on OS X is my fallback
    (and it has saved me at least once)."

  body: "\"Does anybody knows why fontlab crashes unexpectedly?\"\r\n\r\nYou can't
    run it for too long, run long with several other applications running, with a
    large glyph repertoire refreshing, or edit a high resolution font at large magnification,
    without crashes likely to occur. Any time FL fails to immediately respond to edits,
    it is coming soon so I save and restart. And any time it does edits different
    from mine, it's also time to restart. Once or twice a year it gets me bad by not
    saving work anywhere, the latest version simply vanishing to font heaven when
    you quite FL. \r\n\r\nIt beats little pieces of metal trapped your teeth, but
    you have to be careful at all times to observe its behavior and react accordingly
    a the right time. I've found it to be truly unique in this versus all the other
    post-1999 Mac apps I've used.\r\n\r\nChrisL! There is a whole forum set up for
    your kind of whining at the FL site where it can now be less obviously ignored.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Fontlab is unresponsive because of unwillingness, but because they have so much
    work. Twelve or thirteen years ago, in the v. 2 and 2.5 days (PC only), you could
    not possibly have asked for more responsive attention to customers. As the program(s)
    have grown more complex and more successful, it is no longer easy to get Yuri's
    ear. But we wouldn't want to be back in the comparatively simple days of 2.5 either.
    We just have to deal with it. That said, I have noticed that public complaints
    are the best way to get the company's attention. So strike here! You will be heard! "
