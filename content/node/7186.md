body: Hello typophiles... I am a new registrant.  <BR> <BR>I am wondering if there
  is a name for the kind of work I do best. <BR> <BR>I like to be the person who takes
  a project that is about 80% done and makes it right. Tightening the screws, polishing
  it up. Make that a little bigger, kern this a bit, adjust h&amp;j settings, etc.  <BR>
  <BR>I would imagine that back in the day when things were not computerized and the
  workflow was spread over many people there would be individuals who did just this.
  Did these people have a special name? <BR> <BR>Any insight on this or what kind
  of language I can use to differentiate myself from a production person would be
  appreciated.

  body: Back in the London of the 70s, when i worked in typesetting, we called those
    people &#34;Finished Artists&#34;. Not  very clear language, as it wasn&#39;t
    the artists who were finished, but the art, but they were the ones responsible
    for what went to the printers.

    short.

  body: Thank you sirs. <BR> <BR>I was thinking that &#34;Finishing Artist&#34; sounded
    appropriate, but I had never heard it before and didn&#39;t want to just be making
    something up.

  body: The job title Mr Zimmer is asking about has always been and continues to be
    Assistant Art Director. <BR> <BR>Everyone knows the Senior Art Director can&#39;t
    really DO anything. So making sure everything is just so has always fallen into
    the Assitant AD&#39;s lap.  It is a curious phenomenon that once an Assistant
    AD gets promoted to Senior Art Director, they forget how to do everything, and
    become just as useless as the previous Senior AD.

    documents to the printers.  <BR>In english I&#39;d say <i>art worker</i>. <BR>

    typographer or, as Fredrik says, artworker. A finisher would be somebody who finishes
    a job, cutting, folding, gluing &amp;c. <BR>Tim

  body: Ok, now I&#39;m confused.  <BR> <BR>As I understood it, the title &#34;Finished
    Designer&#34; offered by Mr. Spiekermann is &#40;was ? &#41; industry jargon.
    My thought was to translate that to &#34;Finishing Designer&#34; but I certainly
    don&#39;t want to do that if &#34;Finishing Designer&#34; already applies to a
    guy at the print shop who does something very different from what I do. Unless
    that guy is just a &#34;Finisher&#34; and not a &#34;Finishing Artist.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>&#40;I was just thinking I&#39;m being too attentive to too small a detail
    on this forum here, but then I thought better and remembered that there&#39;s
    no such thing as too small a detail for &#34;typophiles&#34; ;&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    art director I&#39;m currently working with thinks this &#34;Finishing Designer&#34;
    business is silly and that I should just call myself a &#34;Production Artist.&#34;
    But its important to me that I not be confused with someone who only does mechanical
    production, as my work is largely typographic. I could always explain as much
    on my resume, I guess... <BR> <BR>Maybe &#34;Finishing Artist/Typographer&#34;
    ?

    always say &#34;Well, that&#39;s what Erik Spiekermann called me...&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>&#40;apologies to Mr. Spiekermann&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously, I avoid all titles
    with the term &#39;artist&#39; in them, not because being an artist is bad, per
    se, but because it carries a lot of implications for the people we work with who
    <i>aren&#39;t</i> in our field. Though &#39;Production Artist&#39; is probably
    more meaningful to a lot of design professionals, I agree that it&#39;s more mechanical
    than what you want. In the end, if you&#39;re comfortable with &#39;Finishing
    Artist/Typographer&#39;, I&#39;d go with it. <BR> <BR>PS: Alisa says hi.'
