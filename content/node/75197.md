  body: "From the picture in the article Raphael Frank a\"h appears to be a non-observant
    Jew. In the time period, non-observant Jew were anti-Torah. Today, all Jews seek
    to be pro-Torah, but have different backgrounds and educations.\r\n\r\nI had thought
    Frank was simply modern and less traditional. I am surprised the typeface is used
    extensively in traditional Jewish circles throughout the world. I would call it
    a treif design, perhaps even made on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nFrankReuhl was a huge
    breakthrough in Hebrew printing, replacing the tremendous role that Romm Vilna
    enjoyed for 100 years. FR is less used today, as Itamar David's David, the fonts
    by Tzvi Narkiss, and Henri Friedlaeder's Hadasa, had eaten away at FR widespread
    use in Hebrew printing."

    and the era's they were used for? I'm not familiar with Romm Vilna at all.

  body: "Prior to the 1800s Hebrew publishing was dominated by basically two Hebrew
    typefaces, which were crudely cut from poor original drawings. But no other designed
    existed, and no better originals could be used.\r\n\r\nThe the Hebrew printing
    establishment belonging to the Romm family of Vilna, Lithuania was establed by
    the family head, Menachem Mann Romm, a very wealthy non-Chassidic Jew.\r\n\r\nHe
    became the choice Hebrew printer in the world, due to his beautifully created
    Hebrew typefaces, based upon accurate ancient original drawings which he secured
    for a great sum of money. Every important Hebrew work was typeset and print by
    his large firm, including his loftiest project, the Talmud - a 15,000 page work,
    divided into 20 volumes.\r\n\r\nRomm bribed the Vatican to open its huge library
    and to allow many Hebrew manuscripts to be copied from inside the bound covers
    of rare Catholic books at the cost of a small fortune.\r\n\r\nThe famous American
    type desinner Frederick Goudy reports that Romm commissioned the students of Giambattista
    Bodoni in Italy to create the hugely popular Romm Vilna typefaces from what appears
    to have been excellent ancient original drawings and manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThis
    dominated the entire Hebrew printing industry until the advent of the FranReuhl
    typeface in Germany in the early 1900s.\r\n\r\nIn the fifties, FrankRuhl's popularity
    began to be reduced by Henri Friedlaender's Hadasa, Itamar David's David, and
    the fonts of Tzvi Narkiss. Eliyahu Koren's Koren only was popular in his printing
    of the Talmud. It was even used anywhere else until Raphael Freeman used it in
    the Orthodox Union prayerbook. I think its a passing fad, propelled his company's
    hype.\r\n\r\nScott-Martin Kesofsky's fonts will become the enduring Hebrew designs,
    only rivaled by my revival of Romm Vilna."

    Vilna\r\nFrom the early 1900's\r\nFrankRuhl\r\nAnd after the 1950's\r\nHadasa,
    David, and the fonts of Tzvi Narkiss\r\nKoren, from the various accounts I have
    received, sounds like it's popularity was never as great as other typefaces of
    the time. Although it is highly regarded in most articles I've read and by most
    Hebrew typographers, whose opinion is easily available publicly.\r\n\r\nYour Romm
    Vilna looks spectacular. I'd like to get a closer look at that!"

    for over 6 years.)\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned in my message that I am referring
    to secular, everyday publishing.  There, David for example, is not that common.
    I would say that after Frank-R\xFChl(s), the most popular faces for long, body
    text are Narkissim, Narkis, Narkis Block, David, Hadassa and recently Michal Sahar's
    version of Arbel."
