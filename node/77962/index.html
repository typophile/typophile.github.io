  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am a Graphic Design student, and we just started a project with these specifications:
 
Take one noun and one adjective to make a 'word pair.' Basically we are making what might be a logotype.
 
No use of additional shapes is allowed.
 
No changes of the letterform design are allowed. (Scale and rotation are allowed, but no subtraction or addition of points/shapes)
 
Considerations:
- find similarities in letter forms, possible ligatures, descenders/ascenders
- look for unique relationships between the letter forms and the words
- find more than one typographic relationship
- vary baselines, type sizes (scale), typefaces
- use proper kerning and tracking
- maintain legibility
- maintain balance
- keep each word's individality through hierarchy or contrast
- do not have a letter do "double duty," using one letter for both words
- do not make pictures out of your words
 
NOW, the argument I have with my instructor is this:
The students are being told to do this using InDesign. I however feel that this is a task better suited for Illustrator.
 
I would like to know what the feeling is here on the forums...
 
Can you explain which would be better and why?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would definitely use InDesign. This is an exercise in working with type, which InDesign does with more precise control and more relevant features than Illustrator, which is not a typography program. Especially as you are not altering the lettershapes, I don't see a reason to use Illustrator. As a designer, I feel InDesign is my default; I use it whenever possible, especially for anything involving type. The only time I would use another program is if InDesign literally is unable to do what I need — which really is not very often. Also, if that is the assignment, then that limitation, along with all the others, is probably there for a reason. I'm interested in why you feel Illustrator would be a more appropriate choice.</div>

Are you just more comfortable working in Illustrator? I've known some designers -- often those with a fine arts or illustration background -- who just enjoyed Illustrator more than InDesign and tended to use it whenever possible. </div>

Even when a vector logo was called for, I'd sketch out the initial version in PS and trace the result in IL afterward. Somehow, pixel-pushing felt comforting. It wasn't until my first internship, that I started to value vector work and a degree of automation in typesetting controls. Naturally, I never confessed this to any of my instructors.</div>

A good design education should definitely focus on design, not software. 

But a working knowledge of the commonly-used design programs (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc) is important too.  Just look at the job requirements for most entry-level design positions. A graduate who doesn't know how to use those programs may have a tough time finding a job.</div>
