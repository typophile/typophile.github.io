  hard time giving some constructive argumentation. Isn't that what a teacher is supposed
  to do? \r\n\r\nAnyways... \r\nThe assignment was to design a foldable poster for
  a fictional congress. The congress is about the expansion of urban areas and the
  problems of over-population in some areas. This is all taking place in the Netherlands,
  which is pretty crowded. \r\nNaturally the text is in Dutch so I'll give a quick
  translation might that be of importance. I was hoping the image would speak for
  itself.\r\n\r\nSPACE\r\nSPATIAL DESIGN(?)IN THE NETHERLANDS\r\n22-25 JANUARI 2009\r\nRAI(congress
  centre in Amsterdam)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RUIMTE1_6268.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI've
  made the type myself and played with it a bit. The edges are supossed to be a bit
  ragged and so is the smaller text."

    like this poster is crowded intentionally. Which is fine, except for the dead
    space in the middle right-side and towards the bottom.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't speak
    Dutch, and without your explanation I wouldn't have any idea what this poster
    was about. What does it say about urban expansion? Could you have used the text
    or color to more effectively get the point across?\r\n\r\nChuck\r\n"

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nPlease don't burn your poster- if that was exactly what your
    lecturer asked you to do, or his/her response just made you wanted to do that.
    (ask him to go and burn himself in hell instead if he said so... :P )\r\n\r\nHere
    are some quick comments and suggestions- hope they are helpful to you:\r\n\r\nThe
    entire poster does communicate the message pretty clear. You may want to work
    on the \"crafting\" to improve the aesthetic.\r\n\r\nYour attempt of using hand
    drawn letters is a good solution to such a topic- you may like to try \"hand-cut\"
    instead. In that way you can achieve the effect of \"natural\" and the font would
    appear to be more confident and less \"wobbly\". (again, hand cut can be wobbly
    too- so it depends on your skill of creating a font ). \r\n\r\nPlease work on
    the structural/ anatomical design of the display type:\r\n\r\nExample- the upper
    part of \"R\" in \"RUIMTE\" seems to be longer and bigger than the lower part.
    A healthy \"R\" has the upper part slightly shorter than the lower part so that
    the \"head\" doesn't appear to be heavy. The \"M\" also seems to be too big/ wide...
    On the forth line of the headline, the \"N\" of \"Natherland\" is too big comparing
    to the rest of the letters and the rest seem to get \"squeezed\" towards the end...\r\n\r\nGreen
    is the right colour to used for the topic of environmental (some might considered
    it too \"safe\"- but better save than wrong.) The gradient effect also adds flavour
    to the green- better than flat background of green. So, that's good move...\r\n\r\nPlease
    work on the details, especially with your typography:\r\n\r\n1. Apply some basic
    typographic rules on your text, such as reducing the diversity of fonts- keep
    to one or two fonts, preferably from the same family. That would bring some \"quietness\"
    to balance of the already busy looking design.\r\n\r\n2. Perfecting your spacing.
    (remember, great graphic designer always pay attention to details and is prefectionist
    in this area )\r\n\r\n3. Introducing \"grid\" to organize your text.\r\n\r\n4.
    Intensify the angles and increse the contrast of each headlines \"zigzaging\"
    into each others, to create a greater sense of visual dynamic and playfulness.
    \r\n\r\nRight now the zigzag effect is \"neither here nor there\"- which make
    the headlines less confident and wobbly... \r\n\r\nThe second line of \"RUIMTELIJKE\"
    seems to suffer from \"optical illusion\" caused by the top and bottom lines,
    which made it appears not to be horizontally straight. Either give some space
    in between the lines or you might as well make the second line slant more obviously.\r\n\r\n(please
    view my attachments for a visual suggestions).\r\n\r\nThese are basic design fundamentals-
    your school should have taught you these. Start applying them. School is a good,
    safty ground for learning (and failing) Your client/ boss in future is not always
    that forgiving.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the real world and happy designing...\r\n\r\n(BTW-
    despite of being a practioner, I am also a lecturer...)\r\n\r\nweng\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample1_5864.jpg]"

  body: "Wow, thanks for the very useful response(s).\r\n\r\nWith the example of sans
    serif text in front of my nose, i can see why it's probably the better choice.
    Especially with something as neutral as univers to counter-balance the more extravagant
    type. I also think you may be right about the hand-cut thing. I thought i liked
    how the hand drawn type was wobly and and bit torn edged, but maybe it's a bit
    too much.\r\n\r\nAbout the fold... I haven't exactly kept that in mind while making
    this poster. Afterwards I tried out some different folds, but none are really
    good. I think I'm just gonna do it over with you're critique in mind.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all the help and your time. When i've tweaked it, i'll post a new example.
    This assignment isn't really running anymore so it could take a while."

    It's sometime refreshing to see what students have done.\r\n\r\nI happened to
    read from other post that Peter Verheul was your lecturer? Man, if I were you,
    I would \"squeeze\" the best out of him- get hold of him, buy him lunch and endless
    cup of coffees, visit his studio (with his permission, of course) and get him
    talk for hours on all his works. If you are good, you might even get to help up
    with some small jobs for him... I bet you would learn much better that way form
    a guy like that than sitting in the class room alone. \r\n\r\n(when you are doing
    that make sure your have your skype on visual for me- I like to sit in as well...

    i guess i'll have to think of somethin else to buy his attention. It's a shame
    i only see him once every two weeks. He's first and foremost a lecturer vor the
    type and media department at my school, while I'm studying graphic design and
    two classes require his attention. \r\nHe does like what i'm doing so that's fun
    to hear. Right now we're working on our first complete typeface. I'm still in
    the sketching fase, but when I have something decent to show i will."
