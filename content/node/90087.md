  digital form)?\r\nI found it on an old letter and I thought it's one of the most
  beautiful monospaced fonts I ever saw \u2026\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nIz\r\n\r\nhttp://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzfvbr4ZTS1qa9zhpo1_500.jpg"

  body: "Right, Lineto's Superstudio is very close. It says it's based on a Selectric
    font called 12 Dual Gothic, so I guess that was it \u2026 No idea who designed
    that font in the first place though \u2026\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help!"
