  anyone know of an alias of FF Scala that is freeware? I don't want to violate any
  copyrights or anything.\r\n\r\nKuenstler 480 is very similar to Scala and is free

    believe that it was often bundled with Corel products, but that doesn't make it
    free."

  body: L&F, you have wandered into the wrong saloon. Asking about free fonts, especially
    a free alias of a well-respected typeface by an honoured designer, is just asking
    for trouble. I'm just telling you so's you don't get a balsawood chair broken
    over your head.

    Rybczyinski's book "The Look of Architecture".

  body: '...And as for what is and isn''t "free"; you should check out some of the
    other threads on this site which discuss End User License Agreements - EULAs -
    and the many twisty turns they often take. A lot of fonts which are free to download
    are not free to use, and I have heard of cases where independent foundries have
    extracted large amounts of $ from design firms over the use of "free" typefaces.'
