body: 'Question: <BR>When I try to tune in to typeradio.com, I get an error that a
  &#34;typeradio[1].m3u&#34; file in my cache is missing. The &#34;File type&#34;
  in the box before this happens says &#34;Winamp media file&#34;, which makes sense.
  So I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just a matter of them going on the air, and it&#39;ll
  work fine tomorrow morning &#40;PST&#41;, but I wanted to check with you guys, to
  avoid potential frantic trouble-shooting later. <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m on WinXP-Home,
  IE6.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I think something is wrong on your end, Hranter. The stream has  <BR>been
    live for a few days, broadcasting a music playlist. Wish I  <BR>could help more
    but I am Winilliterate.

  body: It&#39;s a streaming MP3. How are you connecting to it? Are you clicking on
    the M3U file in your browser?

  body: Yeah, I just tried to hook up and got general flakiness... <BR>But as you
    suspect I probably have something broken on my end too. <BR> <BR>The way I &#34;connect&#34;
    is I simply choose &#34;click here to listen&#34;. Is there another door? I have
    my Winamp set to play streaming MP3s from Shoutcast, so at worst I think it would
    be a minor tweak. But it&#39;s beyond me. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Now I&#39;m getting what I got last night.  :-&#40; <BR>Is there an IP address
    that I could type into Winamp? <BR> <BR>BTW, is there an extended view of the
    program anywhere? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Peter, that looked promising, but Winamp said &#34;could not connect&#34;...  :-&#40;
    <BR>I have less than 19 hours &#40;before Carter&#41; to fix this. Who should
    I ask? <BR> <BR>I guess in the worst case I&#39;ll actually get some work done
    these three days! :-/ Unless I spend them trying to get this to work, of course...

  body: Peter, it works now! I guess the first time that I tried <i>they</i> were
    down. <BR>Now I just have to get used to listening to music chosen by <i>other</i>
    people!  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#40;Thanks!&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
