    ideas. None of these say Mac to me, they say speak and spell.

  body: "I cannot agree with \"Picard\". ( No real name given) Grabbing the mac look
    is a dismal idea in my opinion. \r\n\r\nFirst, it would piss off Apple. Second
    it make you look like an also-ran not a proper company. 3rd it would kill any
    self respect. \r\n\r\nI like the 3rd one best. But I would keep batting ideas
    around. You might want to open up the space between those letters - that compressed
    look is a bit dated in my opinion. I would take  aleaf out of apple's book and
    make thing look simpler. Why not get a techy sans from FontFont?"

  body: "What happened to the counter of the 'g' in the last two images?\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but I think the customized 't' doesn't look right;
    It's too heavy, doesn't fit with the style of the typeface, and the crossbar is
    too high and too light."

    like you were suggesting taking their style & modifying it. Making things simpler
    is more generic. What did you mean anyway?\r\n\r\nI am not sure I hate the t the
    way that Jelmar does but if you open the space up it might call for a revised
