  before the Arts and Crafts movement was the Victorian age which occurred \r\nduring
  Queen Victoria\u2019s reign in England. First looking at the Graphic Design \r\nexamples
  during this time, I was unsure of how I felt about how many graphic \r\nelements
  the designers used on posters and ads. Visually it seemed that everything \r\nbut
  the kitchen sink was in a single ad. The layouts were symmetrical in form with \r\nmany
  added decorative elements. Standards of mass produced items were lower and the need
  for quantity surpassed quality in a lot of instances. However, I feel \r\nas if
  this syle has influenced recent designers that have incorporated typefaces and \r\nlayouts
  from the Victorian era.\r\n\r\n<break>\r\n<strong>Arts and Crafts 1850-1910</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artsandcraft_4334.jpg]\r\nTired
  of the cheap mass production of the Industrial Revolution, John Ruskin and \r\nWilliam
  Morris sought to bring individual craftsmanship back to design.  Morris, \r\nunhappy
  with the quality of home furnishing being sold at the time, designed his \r\nown
  wallpaper, tapestries, and furniture. Morris drew inspiration from nature to \r\ndesign
  his elaborate layouts. He even produced his own typefaces. I personally love \r\nthe
  patterns from this time period, and even though Morris\u2019 layouts utilized very
  \r\nlittle negatives space I really find some of his book designs to be works of
  art.\r\n\r\n<break>\r\n<strong>Swiss Style 1920-1965</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/269418230_8a7ee945f8_3776.jpg]\r\nSwiss
  Style was my first love. I really appreciated the clean and uncluttered lay-\r\nouts
  that incorporated a lot of negative space. This time period produced the re- volutionary
  typefaces such as Univers and Helvetica. The designers during this time period incorporated
  a geometrical grid to layout text and graphics. The simple \r\nlayouts help create
  dramatic posters during this time period.\r\n"
