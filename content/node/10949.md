  anti-aliased use at small type sizes &#40;10-12pts&#41;. <BR> <BR>any ideas? <BR>
  <BR>I know aliased faces such as from miniml or silkscreen, mini 7, sevenet would
  all be much more readable, but I really need to find an anti-aliased font to use
  at those small sizes as well.... are there any that have been designed for on screen
  use? '

    least because you can also use it large on the same &#34;page&#34;, since it has
    a lot of visual interest&#41;, but then to my pleasant surprise I found that Rotis
    &#40;specifically the Sans Ultra Bold&#41; is simply &#42;amazing&#42; at the
    tiniest sizes! <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s how: <A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/rotis_12.gif"

  body: ' Many faces work at that size on screen, provided  <BR>you lean toward the
    bold/medium/demi/heavy side.  <BR>Avoid stuff with lots of fine details or  counters  that
    <BR>tend to fill in. Thus Meta and Univers work well. <BR>Even Caflisch Script
    holds up nicely. <BR> <BR>Curious: do you need anti-aliased fonts because  <BR>they
    need to work in Flash? &#40;There are  <BR>Flash-ready bitmaps out there... fyi.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s for PhotoShop, recent versions have  <BR>multiple settings
    for anti-aliasing--very handy  <BR>when it comes to maximizing readability. '

  body: ' Thanks for the suggestions! <BR> <BR>Yup. This is for Flash use, but it&#39;s
    not because it&#39;s a workaround. &#40;I know there are fonts designed to stay
    aliased in flash&#41;. <BR> <BR>A few of my explorations have turned up the following
    fonts that render very well: <BR> <BR>Linotype Fruitger NEXT <BR>Linotype Univers
    <BR>FF Balance <BR>FF Kievit <BR> <BR>I also want to test out Linotype Compatil,
    but I currently don&#39;t have a copy. Anyone with experience in using this font
    for screen? '
