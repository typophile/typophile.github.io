body: "Im planning to investigate how during the first and second world wars there
  was a very small amount of anti-war material in circulation and total government
  censorship of work produced, and how this differs from modern conflicts such as
  Vietnam, the gulf, Iraq etc.\r\n\r\nI also want to look at the change in public
  protest and opinion and the way that government leaders are portrayed, an example
  of this could be the way in which Churchill was used as an iconic pro-war figure
  during WW2 and in contrast how George Bush has been used to in anti-war material.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've
  currently looked at:\r\n\r\nMilton Glaser- The design of dissent\r\nGraphic agitation
  1 +2\r\nWar posters: weapons of mass communication\r\n\r\nKen garland CND campaigns/
  first things first manifesto.\r\n\r\nHerb Lubalin, no more war in Avant Garde magazine
  (seen in a previous post)\r\n\r\nSagmiester's imperialist comic strip\r\n\r\n+ a
  selection of ww1/2 poster books/designers\r\n\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone has
  any advice on the subject, or can point me in the direction of more material/areas
  of research! Thanks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    You Ride Alone You Ride With Bin Laden: What the Government Should Be Telling
    Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism ]] by Bill Maher examines what could have
    been done in terms of propaganda for the current conflict, but wasn't.  The reviews
    on the linked page explain the book better than I could.\r\n\r\nImages that stick
    in my head from the beginning of The War Against Terror include the shop signs
    that said \"America is Open For Business\" above an American flag with a shopping
    bag handle attached to the top, the photo of a  group of firefighters hoisting
    a flag at the World Trade Center wreckage, and a badly photoshopped bald eagle
    head with a tear dripping from its eye."

    the invasion of Iraq, and questioned the design of the \"quit or die\" flyers.\r\nSubsequently,
    of course, I realized that they had been very successful.\r\nInterestingly, a
    guy from Psy-Ops (the real deal, not the San Fran foundry!) emailed me protesting
    that my criticism was unfair, considering that he was in the field, working on
    a laptop in a tent. I replied, but me email was bounced, so I was unfortunately
    unable to follow up with a dialog, I would have liked to have known if they had
    a print-shop at the air-base, and other production details."

  body: Interesting Topic benm. From which nationality's point of view are you looking?
    Military archives would be a good start for research. Will your dissertation encompass
    all media or just print or film and now electronic media. I would be interested
    in seeing your findings. Just had a thought about having a look at the court /
    prison records.
