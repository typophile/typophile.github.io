  body: The slab appears to be custom to me. Square one is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/red_rooster/banque_gothique_extra_condensed/">Banque
    Gothique</a>. Also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/red_rooster/raleigh_gothic/">Raleigh
    Gothic</a> and <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/morgan-sans/?refby=typographica">Morgan
