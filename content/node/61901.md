  overdue</a>, and I'd like to see if anyone has any great examples of pre war style
  bar logos\r\nmaybe 20's or 30's\r\n\r\nmostly I'd just like to see something masculine
  and refined, this is a sports bar in a building that's been there since the early
  1900's, but we don't really want to remind anybody that it's a sports bar\r\n\r\nthanks
  very much"

    stuck to what we now call viral marketing. '
