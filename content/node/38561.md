    Or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/theserif_plain/?sample_text=TheSerif%20for%20Chaparral%3F&sample_size=36\">TheSerif</a>,
    though I don\u2019t know if the latter is already available as OpenType."

  body: I know you want a serif, but just for reference, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/underware/auto_1_ot/">Auto</a>
