    that SIL might have decided to put them in rlig for compatibility reasons with
    some software that didn't support ccmp but did support rlig (I'm not sure what
    software that would have been).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "John, \r\n\r\nThe comment line\r\n<code># from AAT \u2019morx\u2019; type
    1, sel: 0, cvrg: 20000002</code>\r\nreveals that the OpenType Layout feature definition
    was not taken directly from the OpenType Layout tables but instead, was converted
    from the AAT \"morx\" table. For this conversion, FontLab Studio is mapping some
    morx functions into OTL features with the approximately same functionality, which
    in this case happens to be \"rlig\". This conversion never is perfect or accurate,
    since AAT and OpenType Layout use entirely different models. \r\n\r\nWe do have
    the AAT -> OTL conversion practically just for the handful of developers who would
    like to develop AAT tables and then semi-automatically create matching OTL tables.
    However, since Mac OS X 10.4 added OpenType Layout support, the necessity of creating
    AAT tables is of less and less importance. It only makes sense now for complex
    script fonts, as long as Apple does not implement all the major complex scripts
    in OpenType Layout. In Mac OS X 10.5, basic support for Arabic has been added
    and I hope that in 10.6, more will be done (but I don't know anything specific).
    \r\n\r\nCharles, \r\n\r\nSome fonts made by SIL contain both OTL and AAT code.
    To just get the OTL code, disable \"Interpret GX/AAT mort & morx tables\" in FLS
    Preferences, and re-open the font again. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Thanks, Adam. I made the change and the features file (as seen by FontStudio)
    is much better.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is another switch that I need to change?
    With neither setting did the lookups come through, so of course the features won't
    compile.\r\n\r\nI am trying to get Charis in shape to use for bookwork when the
    general topic is linguistics. I have made up a fair number of extra glyphs in
    Minion, but there are several problems, including (1) There are some glyphs I
    do not have the skill to draw well, (2) The final fonts cannot in any case be
    released to a customer for \"repurposing,\" and (3) certain ideosyncrocies of
    Minion, such as the differing accents on caps from lower case -- make some people
    prefer a more regularized font.\r\n\r\nWith kerning and old-style numbers, Charis
    should function well for linguistics. I notice SIL has just released a version
    with small capitals.\r\n\r\nIf I have to start over with the OT features I will,
    but it seems a shame to not incorporate what has already been done.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "Charles, \r\n\r\nperhaps you can ask SIL to send you the source files, including
    the source files for the OpenType Layout tables? Working with original files is
    usually less problematic than decompiling and recompiling feature definitions.

    case to not only avoid crashing but to give a more balanced space between glyph
    and diacritic.
