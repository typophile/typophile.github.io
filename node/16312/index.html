i have to create a logo (and afterwards the whole cd / styleguide) for a contemporary art museum... (university-project)

for now, i ended up with this logo...

any comment / critic would be appreciated!

besides of that, which fonts would go well with the din and would also be suitable for a cont. art museum (usage: letterhead, etc.. / "normal" textfont)?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arte_e_tempo.jpg]</div>

i like the way the diagonals create a cornered border around the word tempo.
optically the blue on black makes the black look brown. maybe thats just my monitor/bad eyes.</div>

thats true.. i think thats also because of the condensed font.. but if i give this "subtitle" to much room, it gets to much attention in comparision to the name of the museum.
i thought i can remove the subtitle when the logo is printed in small sizes... bad idea?</div>

good idea! i think that it might look nice if the black were switched to brown...

(probably shouldn't be thinking too much about color quite yet)

not sure if its just the size that i am viewing on screen, but it seems like the letters are crunched together.

		<div class="commentbody">i did a research. result was that the majority use a sans serif (mostly helvetica, din, trade gothic). without or with a mark (which often relates to the architecture of the building)

i like for example the logo of the expo hannover (the moiree "bubble", which is always changing)... i think for something like a contemporary art museum, a dynamic (i mean always transforming) logo would be perfect.. 

i didn't want to limit myself, by not using a mark. if i use one, i think it has to be symbolic (communicating the aspect of change and dynamic).

the only thing i know is that the museum has more or less 8 subareas...

exposition, moving exposition, moving library, show, conference, cinema, theater, projection

maybe i can do something with this... that these eight parts are somehow visible in the logo...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This design doesn't look contemporary to me. It looks very 60's/70's industrial/corporate. I like your idea of using the 8 sublevels of the museum. 

There should be a concept behind your design, don't just try and do something that looks "cool". I hope I don't sound harsh here, we all have a tendency to get caught up in executing without a strategy first. 

Dive in to what the museum is about and develop your concept out of that. You will have to explain your design, and why you arrived at your solution, so you should have a good idea behind it. You may have done a lot of this thinking already, but to me this design doesn't feel contemporary.

One final thought - if most museums are using sans-serif, maybe a contemporary museum would break away from that and try something new to set itself apart? Best of luck on your project.</div>
