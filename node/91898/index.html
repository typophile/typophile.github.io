  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Artifacts &hellip; that&rsquo;s what in graphic design is know as those wondering almost rebel pixels of information that somehow manage to stray from the norm in a raster (a.k.a. bitmap) format.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, Artifacts, no matter how much &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; they think they represent/enjoy are still a product of being mathematically generated and are fostered via synthetic means. Still though, they are not quite as, or allow me to say &lsquo;obediently consistent&rsquo;, as are all the other family raster members that go on in a more orderly fashion to create a harmonious bitmap composition.</p>
<p>Artifacts.</p>
<p>According to my savvy interwebs searches through various dictionary sites - there are other definitions.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the freest of free individuals, not only in America but around the world, are those Artifacts that live a daily grind normally associated with the common life cycle of birth-school-work-die &hellip; somehow find brief moments of unattachment from the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; drudgery whilst maintaining a relationship and true association to the whole!! Truth being, if not for the &lsquo;whole&rsquo; there would not a be a single Artifact pixel itself!</p>
<p>Again, please make no mistake, Artifacts are still part of an artificial existence.</p>
<p>As an interesting footnote, the more you squeeze raster / bitmap pixels of information in various formats (a.k.a. file compression), and reduce quality - there seems to be more and more Artifacts.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the more you squeeze raster / bitmap pixels of information in various formats (a.k.a. file compression), and reduce quality - there seems to be more and more Artifacts<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in general<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for &ldquo;file compression&rdquo;. JPEG is the only graphics file format I know that (a) allows you to &ldquo;reduce quality&rdquo; (which is a telling sign it&rsquo;s not a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->normal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> compression, where you&rsquo;d get the same image after decompressing), and (b) compresses more than your average format <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just because<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it may decide to average large patches of different color into one solid block. And when decompressing that, you are bound to get &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So you seem to have a problem with a certain bitmap image. You &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; it using JPEG, and now you are disappointed that you do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get the &ldquo;exact same image&rdquo; back when you view it. Yeah &ndash; that&rsquo;s how it works. If you don&rsquo;t like that, use a different file compression, and make sure to pick a lossless one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that Vector has any sort of authority over Raster. It would be absurd to even suggest a lessening of one at the expense of the other. Quality differential seems measurable, but only if there&rsquo;s a reduction in the two being as  not disparate communities, which is of course impossible.</p>
<p>Having said that there&rsquo;s  a certain conceit in Vector stability.</p>
<p>The suggestion of a pixel information erosion is simply terrific.  A formula to disappear, a cloaking if you will. An organic synthetic erosion seems to me quite desirable from a naturalism point of view. And of course the offer of a regenerative action, a.k.a. a cure? Perhaps that will be our last, and greatest, advancement in silicon techno;logy &hellip; death itself.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Dupont come up with that concept back in the 1930&rsquo;s? Something to do with nylon garments I believe.</p>

<p>Old Nicks, I&rsquo;m more interested in the dichotomy of authoritarianism and free will with an undercurrent of nature&rsquo;s organic DNA. So, planned failure is far more interesting than crude planned obsolescence because you can come back from planned failure. There&rsquo;s an organic quality to it that planned obsolescence doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to have.</p>

<p>My Artefact represents the kind of deconstruction that went on in the 1990s.
Caustic Biomorph most looked the part of artifact as incidental consequence, Beowolf played it best.
But really, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trace of process<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has a long history in type, coming to the fore as each generation of technology is capable of more acuracy than the previous and, with McLuhan’s Laws kicking in, previously obsolesced ground is retrieved, becoming a key component of the new form.</p>

<p>Your organic analogy is precisely that: an analogy, not an equivalence. Except in unusual circumstances, digital replication is lossless. A digital artifact does not evolve nor devolve. A digital artifact does not explore new niches. It is an inorganic, lifeless, thoughtless, soulless simulacrum. The creator of a digital artifact is the artifact&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>You may amuse yourself with hypothetical what-if, but the end product still ends up as planned obsolescence. Art merely imitates life: it doesn&rsquo;t replace it.</p>

<p>Old Nick, by &lsquo;organic&rsquo; I mean to say - inherent relationship to each other and not like a carrot you&rsquo;d pull from the ground. Hopefully this rather simplistic image will help demonstrate my point&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&hellip;on the left is a simple rectangle and the one on the right is the exact same one re-saved for the web with a Quality of 50%, originally done in red - put into gray scale for definition.  So, where did these Artifacts come from? I surely did not put them there!!</p>
<p>Of course in more complex bitmap images such as line work freshly scanned there are tons more instances of Artifacts! But even from my above simplistic rather crude example Artifacts have taken form! They are an organic extension from the original to be sure. File compression has a way of doing this as I mentioned before. So ya, Artifacts can evolve. Can they devolve,  yes of course they can. I&rsquo;d have to do up some examples but off the top of head I&rsquo;d say that a single Artifact can evolve or devolve in bit depth (bpp). Can it explore new niches, as in &lsquo;is it mobile&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s not appropriate to equate human mobility with pixel information mobility, but ya I&rsquo;d say that Artifacts can move within their digital realm. And that&rsquo;s a sad sad thing if an Artifact can realize a realm outside of it&rsquo;s realm - so to speak. Kinda like Romeo &amp; Juliet sort of, in way. And might I just say now that that is to the very essence of this thread (more on that later as we go).</p>
<p>Are they soulless? No, of course not. Everything has a spirit.</p>
<p>John, per-mechanical inking seems almost gestural! 
So awesome!</p>

<p>No matter how many irrelevant examples you produce to support your thesis, the thesis itself is essentially flawed. Creating a simulacrum of anything does not alter the original, thereby affecting its DNA; the process creates a new “original,” whose flaws are the result of the process of creating the simulacrum itself. And a simulacrum of a simulacrum will create more artifacts, none of which are hereditary.</p>

Pure 255-0-0 Red notorious (pure Yellow is another interesting source) most notably in the RGB gamut of life - yes life - pixel life. Silicon technology&rsquo;s life - life within silicon technology, is just as valid an other &lsquo;living&rsquo; organism&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Dez, thanks for mentioning slag - it&rsquo;s a great term!! I hope your buddy made it big - so to speak.</p>
<p>Old Nick, I think your confusion lies within your misinterpretation. Just as we are all descendents &lsquo;of&rsquo; Adam, so too are Artifacts. The original source remains as is, but it&rsquo;s progeny can exhibit unique characteristics. So to that, it is my hope that my above image&rsquo;s relevancy is of great service to you.</p>

<p>I do not believe I am misinterpreting your thesis; rather, I am simply not buying it. Artifacts do not evolve: they degenerate. Perhaps a real-life example will serve to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>There is an old group-sitting-around-a-campfire game that goes like this. One person whispers a phrase or a sentence to another person; that person—and each person in turn—whispers what he or she thinks they heard to the next person, and so on around the circle. The typical result is that the end product bears little, if any, resemblance to the original. The end product is not an evolutionary descendant of the initial phrase: it&rsquo;s the result of noise introduced into the process at each successive stage.</p>
<p>When—or if—microchips actually beget other microchips, silicon life will be demonstrated. Until such time, all you&rsquo;re really doing is mixing your metaphors. Art imitates life: it doesn&rsquo;t procreate it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Old Nick, on the contrary. I see from your example the source of your disbelief.</p>
<p>The people that were retelling retelling the story were - only - doing just that. Take that same group of people and impose varying stimulants upon each person. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I can bet the farm that one of the people - with just the right amount of stimulant(s) - will jolt and exhibit altogether fresh characteristics other than the person before (or the person after for that matter), and express far beyond any verbal communication. For all I know, with the appropriate injection they could grow another digit (so to speak, ahem),  :) 
As my example - as crude rude as it seems - clearly shows that the &lsquo;stimulant imposed&rsquo; on the original 255-0-0 pure red rectangle was, a) the method of compressing the raster / bitmap information (in that example .jpg), and b) the Quality of such a compression. Therein lies your misinterpretation I&rsquo;m sure, or why else would you supply such an off-track comparison?</p>
<p>Does art generate life? Sure it does!! Yes indeed art generates life, it just generates artistic life. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound sarcastic, I&rsquo;m just saying that there is indeed an artistic - linage - just as valid as your own family tree.</p>
<p>So please, now that we have cleared that up, allow me to move on&hellip;</p>
<p>It is my belief, and understanding, that Artifacts speak to the very essence of whence they come!!</p>
<p>Artifacts, those funky groovy rebel pixels of graphic information, are indeed - OF - the very Nature of Silicon itself.</p>
<p>Yes, Silicon!! The very substance which constitutes our era of modern computer / life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Artifacts are the visible rebellious expressions for/of Silicon, (symbol Si as noted in the Periodic Table), and for/of the visible rebellious expressions of ALL the digital elements in general - which shall/allow me to say - constantly keep in touch with their molecular cousins &hellip; Graphite.</p>

<p>You haven&rsquo;t “cleared things up”: no matter how many different outfits you put on it, that dog won’t hunt. Yes, it’s an elegant theory into which you have obviously put a great deal of effort, but ultimately it’s based on the logical fallacy of equivocation: just because—from a certain vantage point—it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it does not necessarily follow that it is a duck.</p>
<p>What you have is a credible premise for a science fiction novel, which is perfectly fine.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Old Nick, it&rsquo;s actually the basis of my first short (probably really short) indie film.</p>
<p>I believe that Ideas push / drive people. Not the other way around, that people drive / push ideas. I understand that the - Idea - is to the very core of who we are. How much less so for the type designer?</p>
<p>And in the times pre-digital the Idea(s) primarily were noted / stated / sketched out with the simplest of methods - the pencil. And at the heart/core of the pencil is Graphite.  I&rsquo;m broadly talking across many many disciplines, Architecture, Engineering, Poetry, Music, etcetera etcetera! Ideas all scribbled down via Graphite and Lead.</p>
<p>It is - or at the very least - rebellious to express an Idea. Even true to this very day within some of the most infernal lands. But, none-the-less, Ideas still push people, they still will trouble people to the point of movement!</p>
<p>It is the Idea that drives / pushes people.</p>
<p>Graphite is everywhere and used everywhere, the pencil you wield today is the of the very same as the pencil being used by a muslim cleric. Furthermore, to some people even to pick up a pencil is to have been given the sense of  self-empowerment!!! It is to have the ability to express - free from the norm - an act of an Individual!!</p>
<p>Dangerous stuff indeed - leads to all kinds of messy stuff such as democracy.</p>
<p>So ya, it all starts with the Idea and the means to express the Idea - usually via Graphite.</p>
<hr>
<p>The digital realm has come about from the non-digital &hellip; safe to say? The digital tries and tries and tries to - usurp (seems to be about the right word, perhaps a little too forceful) the aforementioned freedoms normally - and without  much thought - of Graphite, Lead, and Ink (just to mention a few major players).
But, the realm of Silicon technology is at it&rsquo;s very core still a very natural realm. The digital realm is built from/of natural elements including all polymers. They all come from somewhere - and that somewhere is Nature itself!!!</p>
<p>And so too does Graphite.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that the digital realm is as neat and tidy - sterile and controlled - as it is made out to be.  Even the best mathematical equations can&rsquo;t totally control - an Artifact.  And for the processes that try to go on the Vector existence yearns for the textural / seemingly natural characteristics of the Raster community!! And at the very end of the day - it all degrades - it all falls apart and goes back to &hellip; Nature.  So communities such as Vector don&rsquo;t rule all that much &hellip; and as I said before Vector society is conceited.</p>
<p>I think Artifacts are pixels of information that have been created (progeny if you will), to be pushed / driven to find some sort of Natural freedom. And that freedom of expression goes right straight back to everyone and anyone who has been driven / pushed by an Idea. Anyone who has taken the chance to be free &hellip; expressed via Graphite and Lead.</p>
<p>And ya, Artifacts are the product of Individuality from within the digital realm.  They are Silicon&rsquo;s expression of freedom from within a man made confine! Which is, by-the-way, driven / pushed by the Idea.</p>

<p>The film&rsquo;s working title is &hellip; Lords Of Graphite.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>5star, I like what you&rsquo;re saying, but I have to agree with oldnick. The artifacts you speak of may be due to the nature of the silicon world they live in, but that world was created by some outside force—the manufacturing process, the environment it exists in, the fact that silicon is used instead of some other material, etc. As long as someone else sets the parameters, whether it be the programmer, the algorithm creator, or God, artefactual rebellion can only take place within predetermined limits. Digital artifacts can&rsquo;t rebel to the point of baking me cookies.</p>
<p>Alternately, I may have missed both arguments entirely, which I can take no blame for because it is very late, I ate too much sugar today, and I&rsquo;m not that smart to begin with. Interesting discussion though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Dez :)</p>
<p>Isaac, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but isn&rsquo;t everything created by some outside force?</p>
<p>As just one example, in christian belief, is it a - to far extension - to even consider the Artifact as coming from the hand of god? In that context, I don&rsquo;t think it is all that distant. In fact, it&rsquo;s a lot closer than one might think.</p>
<p>Also interesting to note that there are some really groovy metals used in the construction of the computer&rsquo;s by-ways and high-ways upon which the Artifactual (to use your awesome word) algorithmic expressions  flow / travel. Silver and gold to name but two. And it is to the very purity of those two metals which have a great kinship with some the of world&rsquo;s greatest artist / thinkers of all times! Ideas of fantastic conception from geniuses such as Raphael and Leonardo flowed / traveled through metalpoints of gold and silver and lead - onto the surfaces which are on display to this very day!</p>
<p>Artifacts, those funky rebel pixels of information, &lsquo;staying power&rsquo; is quite as durable?  I think so. Perhaps not the actual display screen you&rsquo;re looking at now, but the disk upon which the information can archived can be reproduced over and over as needed to maintain the information.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is a disconnect from the digital to the non-digital. The world of the Artifact is by extension the same world as that of Raphael and Leonardo et al.</p>
<p>But ya, as I mentioned in some of my above posts/ramblings, as it should be the world of the Artifact is limited and constricted (when viewed from the outside-in!!)  - but that world is most definitely is NOT out of contact with other &lsquo;worlds&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there is a - separation - of worlds at all! In fact, I believe there is a flow -  or better said&hellip; a continuum - between the non-digital and the digital!!!</p>
<p>Everything is connected &hellip; especially in the spiritual essence themselves!!</p>

<p>Futile stuff indeed.</p>
<p>Besides I didn&rsquo;t force anything, the Artifacts were already there, per-existing no?  As I mentioned before Ideas push people to the point of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their<!-- raw HTML omitted --> discovery - not the other way around.  I&rsquo;m not say that Ideas can&rsquo;t be expressed via - committee - but they will surly exist in want of the raw vitality that only the Individual could possibly provide.</p>
<p>Source of debates eternal between Vector &amp; Raster communities I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Old Nick, I don&rsquo;t think it is a matter of perception - illusory or not -  that really matters. In fact more of both the better. But what really interests to me about Kanizsa&rsquo;s work is what lead him to the development of expressing  illusory contours in the first place. And, to the point of this thread &hellip; how he laid them down.</p>

The philosopher John Rogers Searle sagely noted that, where consciousness is concerned, the appearance <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the reality. As Kanizsa’s example clearly proves, we can be easily seduced into “seeing” things which aren&rsquo;t there. Expectations condition response: the mere appearance of reality is sufficient to establish belief in the unreal.</p>

<p>But, first there must be something to be perceived, which as mentioned is what I&rsquo;m really interested in.</p>
<p>It seems to me Kanizsa knew well this truth and leveraged just the right amount of actual physical substance to create his illusory example(s).<br>
Organized religion knows the subject matter a little deeper tho. In order to present something that is not physically there and leave the perception / interpretation up to the participant must first require &hellip; a) an idea, and secondly b) the physical elements of &lsquo;framing&rsquo; the perception &hellip; and in organized religion&rsquo;s practice, c) the fabric(s) of emotion.
Perhaps that&rsquo;s the beauty of Kanizsa&rsquo;s holy triangle &hellip; to be completely devoid of emotion?</p>
<p>Also interesting to consider if Kanizsa&rsquo;s example of illusory contours would be published and openly discussed circa 15th century?</p>
<p>Kanizsa was an Artifact!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In 1805, André-Marie Ampère re-defined the term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cognition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to describe the precise point at which percepts—the raw data—from the five physical senses met the Sense of Self: that is, cognition is the nexus between awareness and understanding. What is revelatory about Ampère’s definition is his choice of words, because it illustrates clearly that our understanding of phenomenal reality is profoundly influenced by an unseen, sixth sense: the Sense of Self.</p>
<p>Unlike the other five senses, the Sense of Self is both intensely personal and transpersonal. We may imagine that we can see something “through another’s eyes,” but we cannot, because what we see through our own eyes is colored by this Sense of Self, which is a product of mind. Furthermore, mind is a product of culture: the context within which the “I” exists and interacts, socially and intellectually. Thus, this Sixth Sense acts as a lens through which we view reality, whose workings are opaque—that is, obscured—because the lens itself is transparent.</p>
<p>Because cultural bias exists and because cognition always occurs at the nexus of experience and expectation, the lens through which we view reality is necessarily but imperceptibly distorted to a greater or lesser degree. Thus, the statement “Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a persistent one” is proven in this regard: our conviction that we have a direct grasp of reality is illusory, because the external phenomena effecting empirical experience are inevitably altered by an occult—that is, hidden—Sixth Sense. “For now we see through a glass, darkly.” But because the “I”—the Sense of Self—is the glass through which we see, the darkness is not apparent.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know much about it.</p>
<p>So ya, self awareness. I don&rsquo;t really think there is such a thing. I believe in the moment of here and now - and that&rsquo;s about it really. And even then it all seems out of control.</p>
<p>Lords of Graphite tries to put forward that argument &hellip; in an AWESOME sort of way.</p>
<p>Crudely summarized, it is the raw - very raw - elements (as in the Periodic Table) of Nature which &lsquo;induce&rsquo; a person, beguile a person, seduce years and years of inspiration (hopefully of an Individual such as Beethoven)  to pick up a pencil (or whatever) and manipulate that person to express an Idea. It could be any Idea. Doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  Beethoven and the creator of any font are all of equal value. The &lsquo;Idea&rsquo; is only a means to an end. And the person through whom the Idea flows - is merely a vessel. At the end of the day it is the Graphite, Lead, Ink, Silicon, etc., which are in control.  And it is those Natural forces which self-promote for the celebration and the continuation of their very existence.</p>
<p>People come and people go. Ideas too. But the Lords of Graphite are the alpha and the omega of all &lsquo;reality&rsquo;!</p>

<p>Neil, what graphic program did you use to create that example? I tried duplicating the test in Photoshop and the result was totally different. Followed your specs as close as I could — a red box, &ldquo;save for web&rdquo;, quality set to 50%,— and I had zero detectable artifacts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that artifacts aren&rsquo;t a problem in some situations, but I&rsquo;m just curious what app you&rsquo;re using as my results were so different.</p>

<p>Old Nick, I hear ya, lol. But, I think all ideas are awesome. And then doubly awesome is having the ability, the time, and the means to express them. The content of the Idea is (imho) irrelevant.  We would all be just a little bit poorer without even just one.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Ayn Rand write about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>JamesM, sorry about that. I roll with Photoshop for my bitmap / raster goodness. Open up a new doc, let&rsquo;s say something standard from the Preset drop down menu such as the 800px x 600px with a white background.  Use whatever you tool you fancy to create a 250px wide x 350px rectangle and fill it with 255-0-0 red, and then Save-for-Web .jpg file with Quality of 100% name it Red.</p>
<p>Close out the &lsquo;live&rsquo; doc, and open up Red.jpg. Re-save the Red doc as a .jpg with a Quality of 50% , name it Red_Artifacts.</p>
<p>Close out the &lsquo;live&rsquo; doc, and open Red_Artifacts. jpg. Grab your zoom tool, and zoom in 400% or so on one of the corners &hellip; and there they are :) The more the process is repeated (especially with lower and lower Quality % settings), the more prevalent the Artifacts. I think it has something to do with a combo of factors including the color frequency of 255-0-0 red in the rgb gamut.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut</a></p>
<p>Hope those instructions will yield the similar results. Of course there are several methods in which Artifacts will appear, (simply scaling down a 255-0-0 red .jpg file is another simple method), but I don&rsquo;t see Artifacts as something unwanted &hellip; they come with the territory :). If you prefer not to have any Artifacts present it is best to save pure red (and simple raster images in general) as gif files.</p>
<p>And speaking of which that gif color table is f&rsquo;n amazing. Someone should create tile patterns for the kitchen (or whatever) with &lsquo;em :) Simply load some image - or even better create one of your own - no matter how complex, and then view it&rsquo;s contents via the gif color table, take a screen shot of it, open the screeny and use the Eyedropper tool to identify the tile colours need to re-create the gif color panel - :)!!</p>
<p>Nerdy wall patterns! Use the free prog rasterbator to create it XXL&hellip;</p>

<p>I followed your procedure exactly (I&rsquo;m using Photoshop CS 5) and still got no perceivable artifacts. I wonder if maybe your original background wasn&rsquo;t pure white.</p>
<p>I know this doesn&rsquo;t change your original point, but I&rsquo;m just wondering if maybe something in your technique is causing artifacts to be more a problem than they should be.</p>
<p>In your everyday work, you&rsquo;re saving your working files as native Photoshop files .psd files aren&rsquo;t you? (Unlike your test procedure, in which you &ldquo;saved for web&rdquo; twice to increase degradation; in effect making a Xerox of a Xerox).</p>
<p>Normally you should never save a file in the JPG or GIF formats (which are lossy) until the very final step, and the working file should remain .psd, so if you need to make further changes you can do it to the .psd file so you&rsquo;ll be working with a pristine image.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, I find that fascinating. Did you zoom in on a corner? And yes I always save my work as .psd files. I&rsquo;ve been doing that since back-in-the-day starting with Ps 7. I then burn them to disks. Do you? It&rsquo;s great looking back at some of the old .psd files, my stacks and stacks of layers - lol!! I used to be so afraid of deleting any layer just in case I needed it to retrace a thought process &hellip; :)</p>
<p>hrant, I&rsquo;m a second gen tortured soul of that I&rsquo;m sure. Raised up in my father&rsquo;s studio I learnt early on that being driven by the Idea is a &lsquo;tao&rsquo; all in itself.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an off switch.</p>
<p>And if I can, I&rsquo;ll take on several ideas at a time. What a contrast that must be to a type designer who can focus and focus for hours and days on end upon one goal / idea.</p>
<p>For instance, today I got a little pissed off with all the yuppies lounging with their latest ipads over at star bucks. So, I got this idea to rebel in my own way - lol. I searched all around town and finally found a vintage portable typewriter - in great condition too - Royal Companion circa 1960. Went over to staples picked up a pad of paper and some white out - and then headed back over to star bucks . Bought a high octane coffee and sat down right in the middle of no less than five ipad yuppies, plunked down my most awesome Royal Companion, open up the case, fed in some paper and started typing. I had the coffee in one hand and banging on these really difficult keys with the other - only stopping to either get out the white out, or to feed in another sheet of paper.</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>After a very short while I had everyone&rsquo;s attention including the manager who couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing! Unfortunately though, it only provoked the ipads to search online - vintage stuff and steam punked stuff and begin a communal discussion.  Which as I look back now might have been the Idea&rsquo;s goal after all. I finished my coffee, packed up my most awesome companion and left somewhat contented&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that is my only - good place - the brief moment(s) after an idea has been successfully brought to live in the light of day.</p>

<p>Yep, I always try to archive my layered photoshop files. It can save lots of work if I ever need to rework the image.</p>
<p>The only problem is that if I pull out an old photoshop file with a ton of layers, it may take me a while to figure out why I constructed it that way and what all the layers do. Especially if I was lazy and didn&rsquo;t give the layers meaningful names.</p>

<p>Your typewriter story provides yet another example of how our preconceptions affect what appears to be reality to us.</p>
<p>I suspect that what rankled your about “all the yuppies lounging with their latest ipads over at star bucks” was that they were, essentially, engaged in Performance Art, based on the premise “Look at me: I am the epitome of the twenty-first century hipster.” Your response was itself Performance Art: fighting fire with fire, if you will. So, your response wasn’t a new idea: it was a variation on a theme with a wry twist.</p>
<p>As such, you deserve points for irony: the badges of “hip” are fungible. The manager obviously got it.</p>

<p>That all depends on what you want to show. The 600×250 PNGs I currently use for full alphabet displays on my website routinely weigh in under 15kb, and they&rsquo;re as sharp as a tack (or smooth, crisp or strong, depending on my anti-alias setting).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, it seems way back in May &lsquo;09 the then editor-in-chief of Artforum Mr. Tim Griffin wrote a interesting article entitled Artifacts.</p>
<p><a href="http://artforum.com/inprint/id=22606">http://artforum.com/inprint/id=22606</a></p>
<p>The gist of which is beyond me but I did take interest in the last paragraph which I have copied to here:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps the problem itself—the feeling of something being lost—is, then, what needs sustaining now. In other words, unlike so many satisfying proclamations of an “end” at previous moments of cultural turmoil—even if only as a rhetorical device where, as Birnbaum says, the end of something like the novel is merely offered as another way forward—an unstable relationship with the past might well be cultivated. Technology, as we have observed, often plays a role in the shaping of perception, and an apt metaphor for our current predicament may be found in the realm of digital imagery and compressed files. Whenever a given picture exceeds the capacity of a system’s data rate, whenever an algorithm inaccurately renders an image—that is, drops necessary information in its attempt to produce a seamless visual representation—pixilation arises and the image disintegrates before one’s eyes. And yet, strangely enough, these imperfections, newly created by an inadequate interpretive model, go by the term artifacts: So it is that we might create similar distortions through our thinking and mistakenly take them as evidence of some historical reality. Worse, perhaps, when we discover our misapprehensions, we quickly move to correct, even to expunge them—precisely when we should be doing our utmost to sustain such images before the mind’s eye, to submit the artifacts to scrutiny, for these mirages of the past will prove a vital part of the picture of our present. '</p>

<p>So yeah, phrases such as &lsquo;algorithm inaccurately renders&rsquo; and &lsquo;image disintegrates&rsquo; and &lsquo;imperfections&rsquo; (etcetera),  and the human reaction to those I find to be interesting dramatic interpretations!</p>

<p>May 2009
Artifacts
Tim Griffin</p>
<p>ONE DOESN’T HAVE TO LOOK VERY HARD to find a common thread running through the various texts in the current issue. Regardless of topic, it seems, nearly every contributor gravitates, sooner or later, to the same concern: that we are in the midst of an epochal shift the consequences of which are obviously powerful yet dauntingly unclear. “Something is falling apart right now, and not only in the art world,” says this summer’s Venice Biennale curator, Daniel Birnbaum, speaking to the ways in which our volatile social and economic context risks making any cultural endeavor seem out of tune, if not passé. “I think we’re at a moment in history where we’ve already begun a kind of apocalypse of thought,” director Jim Jarmusch adds, as if in direct reply. “All the models we have been led to believe in are crumbling.” (And so, he says, the structure of his newest film revolves around ideas of the unconscious: After all, if the terms for subjectivity are changing rapidly, we’d better make records of the latter before it becomes entirely unrecognizable to our own eyes.) These sentiments are only confirmed by critic Bruce Hainley in his survey of Larry Johnson’s artwork over the past twenty years. The author returns time and again to the artist’s lingering subtext of perishability, which extends from depictions of yesterday’s technologies to intimations about the arcane tasks of pedagogy and critical writing and, further, to the fashioning of identity itself, which such technologies would shape. The underlying question, and the stakes: As the cultural conditions of the postwar era seem finally on the wane, who is the producer of art today—and for whom is art made? “The ‘I’ is over, elided, deceased, absented,” Hainley surmises. “There’s no thinking ‘eye’ to see or read, no more subject to leave a trace, everything disappeared into nevermore, into névé.”</p>
<p>In truth, our sense of history has been markedly unstable for some years. Immediately before the financial crisis—which undoubtedly provided the spark for much of the consternation above—there was, for instance, the “war on terror,” whose borderless expanse scrambled the coordinates of time for no other reason than that its paradigm was designed never to end. Now, however, it is our relationship to an unsettled past that seems as much a source of disquiet as our increasingly ambiguous future, recent decades suddenly not what they once appeared to be. In fact, our sense of the present seems to hinge on our reconstruction of the previous few years: How else can we reconcile its image of prosperity with our current grasp of what was residing, more abstractly and systemically, everywhere under the surface? And how else might art chart its course without somehow taking stock of the ways in which its basic form—or even its very idea—was enmeshed in a flawed understanding of those earlier cultural conditions? Many lectures and panels have lately been devoted to precisely these questions, reevaluating the recent past, revisiting the precursors of postmodernism and modernism—even seeking out some approximation of an earlier hour’s public sphere—in order to regain some of art’s bearings. (One gets a distinct sense on these occasions of people awkwardly trying to summon some memory—not only of, say, how public discourse and theory are not separate from everyday life but also of how to engage an audience, or of how to be an audience, within such an engaged framework.) But here a note of caution sounded by artist Lorraine O’Grady seems worth considering. Looking back in these pages at an exhibition she organized in the East Village during the early 1980s, she wonders what might have become of certain artists had events unfolded differently—if critics or collectors had, for example, simply given a particular artist’s work more attention. As compelling in her ruminations, however, is a suspicion of the historical impulse, of the very desire to establish set narratives for the past when there will always be worthy alternatives: “There are so many coexisting tendencies in any given time,” she says. “What is lost when the present reduces the past, ties it up with a ribbon so it can move on to the future? Is that result necessary? Is it real?”</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem itself—the feeling of something being lost—is, then, what needs sustaining now. In other words, unlike so many satisfying proclamations of an “end” at previous moments of cultural turmoil—even if only as a rhetorical device where, as Birnbaum says, the end of something like the novel is merely offered as another way forward—an unstable relationship with the past might well be cultivated. Technology, as we have observed, often plays a role in the shaping of perception, and an apt metaphor for our current predicament may be found in the realm of digital imagery and compressed files. Whenever a given picture exceeds the capacity of a system’s data rate, whenever an algorithm inaccurately renders an image—that is, drops necessary information in its attempt to produce a seamless visual representation—pixilation arises and the image disintegrates before one’s eyes. And yet, strangely enough, these imperfections, newly created by an inadequate interpretive model, go by the term artifacts: So it is that we might create similar distortions through our thinking and mistakenly take them as evidence of some historical reality. Worse, perhaps, when we discover our misapprehensions, we quickly move to correct, even to expunge them—precisely when we should be doing our utmost to sustain such images before the mind’s eye, to submit the artifacts to scrutiny, for these mirages of the past will prove a vital part of the picture of our present.</p>
