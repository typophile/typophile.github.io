<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello all, just a note to let you know that the Helvetica film DVD is now available for pre-order. More info here: http://www.helveticafilm.com/shop.html
The DVD includes 95 minutes of bonus material... we basically edited 41 short interview segments, each around two to five minutes long. If you've seen the film, you'll have an idea of the format of these.
We'll definitely post Quicktimes of several of them in the next few weeks... any requests?
Cheers,
-Gary

I dunno if I want to fork over $75 for the collectors edition. I'm a type nerd ... but maybe not that much.
For $20 I will definitely buy the regular version. It would have cost me that much to get to Toronto to see if shown there, if I had known it was coming.</div>

ROFL! Well, one quick f-word made it into the final cut: when I worked at CBC, you were allowed one a year without any sort of retribution, but it had to be in context. :-)
Perhaps the Helvetica extras with Herr Spiekermann are rated R!
(And how soon will someone come up with a YouTube video of him rapping it? Inquiring minds....)</div>

<div class=commentbody>@Stewf:
"Hmm, I beg to differ. Carson’s was the only segment that could have been left out of an otherwise perfect set of interviews."
Carson looking at that set of index cards with words on them was very good, I thought. It really showed the opposite end of the spectrum advocated by Wim Crouwel or Vignelli, as represented by Helvetica. It was a nice way to show that, yes, Helvetica does have it's purpose, but no, it's not for every purpose.
Remembering the post-movie questions at Typecon, it's good to remember that not everyone who is going to see the movie is in Spiekermann-lingo a "Typomaniac". At least Carson wouldn't put the audience to sleep.
But that's why the DVD extras will be nice, for those of us who actually <em>want</em> to hear the Moderns rambling on about the virtues of Helvetica.
I only wish that there were some mention about Univers, which should possibly make it into the extras? </div>

I can imagine there was a lot of people Gary had to put off the list because of that reason but as a great type designer, as the designer of univers and frutiger and also as a swiss type designer who's work is making the link beetween the swiss modernism (represented by helvetica) and the more "traditional" approach of typography, i'm pretty sure Frutiger's views would have been more than one quotes among others.
Anyway i'm sure the movie is interesting and i'll get the dvd :)

But that's just it. Univers is NOT Helvetica. But it came out at the same time, had a similar purpose, was revolutionary in the amount of original weights, is arguably subtler, and...
Is not as popular as Helvetica and wasn't even mentioned in the film.
The Modernist stuff that was discussed in the film used Univers as much as or more than Univers.
It deserved at least a passing mention, and only Carter in the Q&A briefly hinted at it when he referred to the "distribution" of Helvetica, as opposed to Univers', as being responsible for its success. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe someone can speak to this further, but I got the sense when I was originally contacting people about the film that Frutiger wasn't doing interviews anymore, for health reasons... or maybe he's just plain reclusive now. And his nephew did do that piece for German television about him a few years back.
I'll have to go back through the extras and check on Univers shout outs. Crouwel discussed it, and of course there were mentions of Univers during the other interviews we did, but getting into Univers in any sort of in-depth way in the film required a lot more back-story, showing examples, how it differs from Helvetica, who Frutiger was. There's only so much you can do in 80 minutes, and in order to try to keep things focused on Helvetica, we decided not to go down that route. Ditto with Arial.
But I'm sure there are several examples of Univers in the film anyway, on street signs, etc... a few had to have slipped in. So get the pause button on your remotes ready...
Cheers,
-Gary

<div class=commentbody>RussellM, a name and initial that seems vaguely familiar in some hard-to-define way, blind people don't watch captioning.

<div class=commentbody>I often read people that don't like helvetica and oppose univers to it, just saying it's so much better. For me, this is the result of a misunderstood of modernism and what swiss designers where trying to achieve at this time, and still. There has already been a long talk here about helvetica and i don't want to start the fight again :)
What is really really interesting about a Frutiger interview is that he could help people to understand what modernism was looking for. For me, one of the most interesting thing (i think it's in the movie his son made) is the comparison with water. The look for the purity of the form is an essential idea in modernism. With helvetica this purity has been sold as neutrality, meaning you can use it for anything what, i agree, is wrong. But helvetica and univers (and most of frutiger faces) achieve to reach this purity, this "universality" of the shape, each by different ways. I like both.
Edit: okay Gary, thanks for the explanation. My point was absolutely not to say something was missing or incorrect in your movie and i hope you did not feel it this way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>joeclark: <cite>There is some dispute at present over whether or not what you will get in English will be captions, and of what quality, or “subtitles” in Arial Narrow.</cite>
Hmm, I asked whether it was English captions just to make sure it wasn't English language with German subtitles, i.e. subitles only when German is spoken but no captions for English dialogue. This happens often on foreign films, "Japanese and English subtitles" displays only Japanese subtitles. Frustrating for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.

yes, of course.
:P I really didn't imagine anyone would take that comment seriously enough to offer a thought-out reply.
I was plainly referring to what one might imagine is the demographic for this film. I do believe it's most obvious appeal is to people with an active interest in visual design, which kind implies a certain lack of serious visual impairment - Granted, exceptions exist, but I just went ahead and made a vast over-reaching generalization anyhow. And, yes, attention should be paid to the design of captioning and subtitles. I thought that here, that would be obvious.

<div class=commentbody>Wow... Joe, I truly appreciate your opinions on this, but the tone of your manifesto is really disappointing. You're basically venting on the entire home video industry's approach (or lack thereof) to accessibility, and focusing it on me and this film. When I said I'd discuss DVD accessibility with you when I met you at the Toronto screening, I meant excactly that, that we'd discuss it, that I wanted your input. But I refuse to feel that if I can't incorporate every single one of your "suggestions," then I'm irresponsible and uncaring.
In the manifesto you've woven in comments and attitudes from other people, not me, including some quotes from others in this thread. Again, you're venting on others here, but blurring it and transferring it to me. Every time you use the term "you," you're accusing <cite>me</cite> of something... like I've been oppressing deaf and blind people for decades??? Jesus, I just made a little film about Helvetica. C'mon, Joe. I know your heart is in the place on these issues, but I don't like getting publicly attacked for things I haven't done, and for opinions that aren't mine.
The plan has <cite>always</cite> been to have subtitles on the disc, and I'll do the best I can to take your suggestions into account regarding their quality and legibility. And I guess I forgot to mention in the email I sent you that I personally transcribed the film for the subtitles, so there won't be any spelling errors. I'll make the DVD as accessible as I can, given the budget and time constraints that any independent film producer is always under. And on that front, are there any documentaries on DVD, self-released by independent producers, that have adhered to every one of the requirements of the Clark Manifesto?
Again, I think your heart's in the right place here, Joe. But blaming me publicly, with the tone you've taken, for all the frustrations of disabled people when it comes to enjoying films is misplaced.
Cheers,
-Gary

So yeah, you're right. Spiekermann's interview was thoroughly entertaining in its irreverence for the subject matter. Audiences should certainly like him, as well as Carson, if only because they don't represent that cool, detached modernism of most of the rest of the flic.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sometimes people who have some challenge end up with a chip on their shoulder.
I use to have a mild case of it before Adobe started making an equivalent version of Photoshop for PC (some of you youngsters might not remember this. I think it was around version 3?).
Just because I was handicapped by Windows 95, was that any reason to heap it on? I submit that it was not, and thankfully Adobe finally realized it.
And it's just a guess, but I bet they are selling as many PC versions as Mac now.
