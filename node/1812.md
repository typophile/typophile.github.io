  body: It is almost certainly not a font, but hand lettered. The o and v link together
    as a ligature in a unique way, and the e is clearly designed to only work at the
    end of a word, and the L is one that could only work at the beginning of a word.
    <BR> <BR>It would be possible to do something like this in an OpenType font, but
    only a couple of OpenType script typefaces have been done that are so elaborate,
    and this isn&#39;t one of them. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
