  body: "It's funny you say that. Often I have the impression that I identify certain
    typefaces that are available in numerous variations (like one of the many Garamonds
    for example) because they <em>feel</em> a certain way. It's almost an unconscious
    thing.\r\n\r\n<em>Could it be I'm channeled by a higher power? By the Great Type
    Identifier in the sky? Or is it just the drugs?:-D</em>"
