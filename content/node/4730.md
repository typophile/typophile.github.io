body: 'I have been thinking of buying Syntax, the recut version from 2000. Fonthaus
  has a CD named <i>Syntax family classic</i> which contains the full family -- 30
  weights. I would like to know what are the differences to the <i>Syntax platinum</i>
  CD which also contains 30 weights, but at a much higher price tag. <BR> <BR>Or any
  suggestion for other sans face, budgetwise for a student? I plan to use sans in
  my thesis: in tables, figures, and algorithms. I use a lot of small caps for acronym
  in text, so sans with small caps and text figures would be a great companion. <BR>
  <BR>TIA,'

  body: 'A couple of recommendations: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/stella/?">Stella</a>--A
    nice sans from Feliciano Type. Only two weights, but it contains tabular numerals
    and small caps. The Indie Fonts 2 book shows a text setting and it&#39;s very
    nice for only $200. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_sophisto_ss.html">Sophisto</a>--A
    more modern sans from PsyOps. Large family of types including dingbats and ornaments.
    I&#39;m thinking about getting this one for only $135. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.stormtype.com/sebastian.html">Sebastian</a>--From
    Storm Type. A 37 font family for $307. I believe it&#39;s available in OpenType
    which would be great if you&#39;re using InDesign. Check out the PDF. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    Syntax, I&#39;m not sure about the huge price difference. You&#39;re right, it
    looks to be the same family of types--only one is older and one is newer. Interesting...

  body: The FontHaus CD does contain the entire Platinum version of Syntax, for a
    fraction of the price.  The CD was obviously a mistake on Linotype&#39;s part,
    and they discontinued it, but FontHaus still has a few units available for sale.

  body: Thank you for your info, Albert. <BR> <BR><i>Stella</i> looks very nice; actually,
    I think that it converys the same feeling as <i>Rongel</i>, also from the same
    designer.
