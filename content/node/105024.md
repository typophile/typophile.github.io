  body: "Amazingly, the serif font looks like Palatino \u2014 I write \u201Camazingly\u201D
    because Palatino seems to have been released by Stempel in 1949-1950: how come
    it is used on an SS stamp?!\r\nI\u2019d say Luthersche Fraktur for the other typeface."

  body: That serif sure does look like Palatino - typeface designed by Hermann Zapf
    and initially released in 1948 by the Linotype foundry.

    if Palantino is '48, it can't be that. These are dated during the war. Thanks
    for all the help so far though."

  body: The Palatino? Maybe Zapf drew the text for that stamp during his time in France
    and finished it in '48?

  body: This seems really suspicious. The Palatino shown in the sample doesn't match
    the original metal cut. It matches the later phototype version of Palatino. The
    original had a smaller x-height/taller ascenders, the top of the /t/ was taller,
    and the /g/ was more squat. The /6/ and /8/ also match the phototype version,
    but not the metal version. I'm not sure exactly when the revised phototype version
    of Palatino was released, but it was not before the sixties, more like the seventies
    as far as I can recall.

    contrasty, there are small differences in "r" "f" "e", UC letters are bigger,
    ascenders are taller.)'

  body: So what are the dates on the SS documents - Zapf was not doing anything with
    type until after 1946 so it being Palatino (which I said it sure looks like in
    an earlier post) is impossible if it is an authentic SS document.

  body: been kindof reading along, and looking up a bit of history. i think it not
    impossible that Zapf did pen the letters for the stamp. he was conscripted, and
    worked desk jobs including a lot of writing/cartography/etc as he was basically
    a poor soldier. the names on the papers seem accurate & traceable. why not?

    addition. Some Bodoni may be the case, the other one: I am not familiar with it.
    The one storey g is rare, checked my photocopied Seeman\u2019s Handbuch der Schriftarten
    from 1926, it could be something like Schmale fette D-Antiqua by Klingspor. Seemann
    only shows \u2018Hamburgers\u2019 \u2026 apart from that I do not have another
    specimen showing that typeface. Maybe someone else here has?"
