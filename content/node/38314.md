body: "A question raised by a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/38292\">recent discussion</a>:
  <strong>what digital tools are type designers using today?</strong> Let's keep the
  discussion separate, and use this thread only for poll answers.\r\n\r\n<ol><li>On
  what operating system do you do most of your type design work? \r\n(Examples: Mac,
  Windows, Linux)</li>\r\n<li>In what application do you do most of your letterform
  drawing?\r\n(Examples: Illustrator, Fontographer, FontLab, Corel Draw)</li>\r\n<li>In
  what application do you do most of your [[font editors|font editing and mastering]]?\r\n(Examples:
  Fontographer, FontLab, DTL FontMaster)</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rules:</strong>
  Please, no discussion here. Only one post per user. Only one answer per question.
  \"Both\" is not a valid answer -- I recognize that many type designers use both
  Mac and Windows and more than one or two applications, but for the purposes of this
  simple poll, please only respond with the primary OS and apps (one for drawing and
  one for mastering) that you use for the bulk of your work.\r\n\r\nResults and analysis
  will be published on [[Typographica]].\r\nThank you for participating!"

    are: the ratio of OSX versus Windows; and the various ways in which certain people
    use both FL and Fog. For example in my case I had avoided the latter for years,

    the existence of alternative applications? I'm personally very happy about this.
    I've always felt that FontLab Studio came into the position of being the major
    font editing application on the market partly because no other company spent time
    and money to develop for this market. It's great that it's finally changing! With
    many products completely gone (e.g. FontStudio), I think it's time for new concepts
    and new ideas. The fact that Georg has been able to release Glyphs is a great
    sign, and I'm looking forward to seeing RoboFont. With the advent of UFO, the
    designers will finally have the possibility to choose the tools they prefer, mix
    them, combine them in a workflow that, hopefully, will be more seamless. \r\n\r\nWorking
    for a company such as Fontlab Ltd., where the expectations of the users have been
    extremely different, I've often found myself in an almost impossible position
    to try to come up with ideas for \"one tool that fits them all\". This has not
    been the most comfortable position that you can imagine. Speaking in even more
    frank terms: it's almost become quite boring to realize that the only things that
    can improve the type design process are the things that Yuri and myself come up
    with! \r\n\r\nSo I think we're all more than relieved that we'll have less pressure
    on a single manufacturer to deliver *all* of the functionalities that *all* users
    wanted. \r\n\r\nWith a number of software vendors on the market, we will finally
    have a chance to specialize a little bit: let the people do what they can best.
    \r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've been truly excited about new software coming
    up, and with RoboFont, this certainly is the case again! :) \r\n\r\nAwesome. "

    too.\r\n\r\nAdam: <em>It\u2019s great that it\u2019s finally changing!</em>\r\n\r\nThat

    <em>I\u2019ve often found myself in an almost impossible position to try to come
    up with ideas for \u201Cone tool that fits them all\u201D.</em>\r\n\r\nInspired
    by the numerous command line tools of the IKARUS V4 program, at the end of the
    1990\u2019s I decided that DTL FontMaster would become a suite of (a limited number
    of) separate modules. Partly IKARUS V4 functionality was combined and ported by
    URW++ to Mac OS 9 and Windows, and subsequently additional functionality was added.
    It actually turned out that the majority of type designers did not really appreciate
    this modular approach (the DTL workflow PDF to which I provided a link in one
    of my previous posts will probably look foreign to many of you, and although it
    may seem [unnecessary] complex, even my six year old daughter can theoretically
    handle the library by invoking the command files [not only because she is brilliant]).
    So, especially the companies used to the IKARUS V4 program and its siblings (\u2018B\u2019,
    \u2018D\u2019, \u2018M\u2019) or having IK data still became our main customers
    (when it comes to the Mac market we were also a bit unlucky that the compiler
    that we used was not updated for OS X). \r\nSo, I am curious to which extent the
    market has changed over the past ten years. At least it looks as if quite some
    Typophilers are combining FLS with for instance the AFDKO, TTX, OTM, etc. already.
    Also scripting has generally become a standard part of the type design and font
    production processes.\r\n\r\nAdam: <em>It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve
    been truly excited about new software coming up [...]</em>\r\n\r\nIt depends on

    is there really anything to back up this notion? Obviously the professional font
    development market is tiny, but there are lots of artists, designers and hobbyists
    playing with fonts. Enough of them exist to have kept Fontlab afloat despite a
    half-decade of failed attempts to update Fontlab. Macromedia's failure with Fontographer
    might have had more to do with the version 4 redesign of the app as it did with
    the size of the market. Like Fontlab, DTL's tools lack an inviting UI and most
    of them are only available on a platform that is unpopular with typographers.
    Fontforge is just as ugly, bloated, and overcomplicated as Fontlab and is only
    stable on Linux.\r\n\r\nI think Tim is right to ask \u201C\u2026who is to blame?\u201D.
    It might very well be that there's a sizeable market for a well-designed, intuitive,
    stable typeface design tool. But until last week nobody was selling one. If Glyphs
    and/or Robofont catch on I think that we can assume that the real problem has
    been the software developers all along. Or, to paraphrase at least a dozen designers
    I have spoken with, \u201CI don't design fonts because of Fontlab.\u201D "

  body: "Hi James,\r\n\r\nYour analysis of the font production tools market is perhaps
    completely correct, but personally I have the feeling that some things might be
    a bit more complicated. I could be wrong though. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, it seems
    to be a natural process that after a certain period there is a request for new
    tools, whether these are for making page layouts (we have all seen the major shift
    in this area in the past decade), type or any other software products. This request
    can be the result of a change in technology, a shift in the (preferences of the)
    market, or be generated by new ideas of developers. \r\n\r\nThe market for font
    production tools is quite diverse actually and although the emphasis for type
    designers perhaps more than ever seems to shift to the GUI (and the Mac), still
    we have our (Windows) customers in the font business that consider the batching
    options that we offer the most important. This difference in preferences might
    be the result of for instance the scale of one\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nUsed to
    the clear but not very fancy editor of the IKARUS system, for me the old Fontographer
    3.x had a great and sensitive GUI for editing B\xE9ziers. Later editors got more
    and more functionality that I actually never got used to. I don\u2019t actually
    know whether Fontographer 4.x was a failure; I reckon that FontLab Ltd. started
    the development of an OS X version because there was still quite some request
    for the application. \r\n\r\nThe development of FM started at the end of the 1990\u2019s
    because at URW++ and DTL there was the need for a more advanced professional production
    tool. Hence the modular structure and the IKARUS-based batching options of FM
    (like the ones for the generation of OpenType layout features). We especially
    targeted FM at the higher end of the market, where it has its fair share still.
    Clearly FLS largely conquered the \u2018main\u2019 end user market for font editors
    and we accepted that fact already at an early stage (if only because we could
    not generate a Mac OS X version at that time). \r\n\r\nFLS is reigning for more
    than ten years now and offers a wealth of options. FontForge is strong when it
    comes to its technical functionality (and it is for free!). The new editors seem
    to offer an improved GUI, improved support for scripting and a more open structure.
    The new Google (cloud) font editor will offer stuff online (for free). As I said,
    it is going to be interesting how the market for font tools will develop further.
    \r\n\r\nThe question \u2018[...] who is to blame?\u2019 was not raised by any
    of the developers of the forenamed font tools, as far as I know; at least I heard
    nobody complaining. They (we) all know that there is a natural evolution in the
    software business, and that products (and sometimes even companies) come and go.
    They (we) also know that there are major investments required for the development,
    marketing, maintenance and support of software products. And above all, they (we)
    all welcome any form of competition, as competition is a sport as such, which
    in most cases will improve the trade.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    It is, however, true, that Fontlab Ltd. seems to be the only company that does
    not develop font development software for the purpose of publishing their own
    fonts, so the only income it generates comes from sales to \"3rd party customers\".
    There are a few other smaller companies, such as High Logic (the developer of
    Font Creator), and of course there is George Williams with his ambitious FontForge.
    \r\n\r\nMost other font software publishers are in the mixed business: DTL & URW++
    and Georg Seifert are font publishers who also have created font development software,
    and at least partially, the driving force behind that development was the ability
    to complete their own font projects, which is of course not a bad thing at all.
    Monotype, Linotype, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe or LettError have done so similarly
    -- and many of those tools are truly wonderful! \r\n\r\nSo, I'm not saying that
    this model is better or worse, but it certainly is different. Therefore I should
    revise my statement by adding: \r\n\r\n> no other company spent time and money
    to develop *solely* for this market.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
