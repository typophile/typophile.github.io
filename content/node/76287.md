  it's about at least five years ago. So the best detail I can give you at the moment
  is it existed in 2005.\r\n\r\nI only have this S letter, and cannot provide any
  details about any other characters either. I know it's only a very little details
  to work with, but hope somebody will help me.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
