  is a school in Germany that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for
  the approach to design that it publicized and taught. It operated from 1919 to 1933
  and marked the beginning of the Bauhaus Movement. Above is a Bauhaus catalog cover
  designed by Herbert Bayer. The sanserif typeface and simplicity of the piece really
  exemplifies what the movement stood for. I like this piece because it is so bold.
  The colors and large lettering really attracts my attention. <!--break-->\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/38dolepineapple

  1925 until 1939 that affected the decorative arts (architecture, interior design,
  and industrial design), as well as the visual arts (fashion, painting, the graphic
  arts and film). This movement wasa combination of many different styles and movements
  of the early 20th century, including Neoclassical, Constructivism, Cubism, Modernism,
  Art Nouveau, and Futurism. Above is a 1938 Dole Pineapple Gems Art Deco advertisement.
  It was designed by A.M. Cassandre, a founding leader in French Art Deco graphic
  design. Like the movement, this piece is quite decorative. I like how the more realistic
  pieces of pineapple are bursting through the pineapple contour. the contrast really
  catches my eye.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wes_wilson resize_3441.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  1960s was a time of psychedelics. The style itself came about through sub-cultures
  of different cities such as London and San Francisco. Music, drugs, art, literature
  and hippie activities were the drive behind psychedelic art, which became an interesting
  fusion of fine art and commercial art technique. Wes Wilson was a leading designer
  in the Psychedelic movement in San Francisco and the creator of this poster.\r\nI
  love the Psychedelic movement and this piece because of the amazing color palate
  that most of the posters of that time period are known for. They are crazy, bright,
  colorful, and most likely drug inspired. Personally, I think it\u2019s nice that
  the artists behind the psychedelic art age took the drugs so we could appreciate
  the visual beauty while maintaining our sobriety. The imagery throughout many of
  his posters involves the female form and the flowing curves of the body/hair. These
  forms were made even more intense by the variations in line-work and extreme colours.
  The hand made type could almost blend into the image itself because it pushes the
  limits of legibility."
