  body: For their logo they could use some pointed-apex sans with  <BR>the &#39;V&#39;s
    flipped and dotted for the &#39;A&#39;s. <BR> <BR>The rest of that site uses <a

  body: Yes, Stephen is right, of course; Aveda makes good use of TheSans as well
    in their print work. <BR> <BR>I posted a silly little blurb &#40;<a href="http://www.daidala.com/07oct2002.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.daidala.com/07oct2002.html</a>&#41; in regard to this
    on daidala a few months back. <BR> <BR>Jon
