  body: I prefer the one on the right. The x-height to cap proportions are better
    and the kerning is superior. Also the waist strokes on the H and F while a tad
    low look better than the overly high version on the left.

  body: For what it's worth, looking at this in Safari on an iPhone (late at night),
    the one on the right looks better. I have no bias I am aware of, use Windows 7,
    Ubuntu and OSX (I loved my old Amiga most of all though!) but the one on the right
    just looks clearer to me.

  body: Hm. Isn't there a problem that we're looking at static graphics of webfonts
    on devices other than the ones intended? Or is that the whole point of making
    the graphics? I'm confused :-/

  body: Windows is doing some horrible things to those caps. Look at the bar on the
    'H'. You could drive a bus between the 'F' and 'J'. If we're equating rendering
    superiority with sharpness alone then Windows is winning here, but it's lost most
    of the character of the typeface and is showing a fair bit of dazzle. If I was
    going to be reading anything more than a paragraph I'd plump for the OSX rendering.

  body: 'I think the general qualities of this work are great. What''s been compared
    here, though, is rather subtle. If the publishers at some point decide to pump
    a PX into the cap ht., and the browser decides to kern, the differences between
    these two samples are so small, few would stretch to describe the difference as
    significant, (much less, any more than that).  There was most likely a difference
    in devilopment paths with the one on the left being a pain in the ass long after
    the one on the right is complete. And... at 9 PX, i think there are very few users
    on the right side to begin with. '
