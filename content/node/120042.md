  body: "Hard to be sure, even after correcting for the perspective, but I think this
    might be Koch Quadrat Fill by Harold Lohner, with some custom rounding:\r\nhttp://haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/koch-quadrat/\r\n\r\nP22
    Platten Neu Pro Light is also very close, but the K and S aren't quite the same
    as on your sample:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-platten-neu/\r\n"
