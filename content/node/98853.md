  FHA Condensed French probably started life as wood type for displays, headlines
  and posters. The exaggerated sharp serifs and condensed forms were not uncommon
  for that period. At some point, sign painters picked up Condensed French added their
  own character. At the end of the nineteenth century, Frank H. Atkinson included
  Condensed French in his samples of lettering for his book, \u201DSign Painting,
  A Complete Manual.\u201D This book became one of the definitive guides for signwriting
  and hand lettering.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1999, Mike Adkins digitized Condensed to add to
  our Atkinson collection. For its re-rele ase, Condensed French has been updated
  with more language support, ligatures, and OpenType alternates. It has true vintage
  character but still plays well in more modern designs. A font for all seasons, the
  condensed forms and sharp serifs fit in every layout from wildwest days posters
  and creepy film credits to Christmas ads and Mother\u2019s Day cards. While I can\u2019t
  really see FHA Condensed French as the font for phone aps or video game text, it
  will provide impact to logos, branding, and product labeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CondFrench
