  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Here is a predicament that has been bugging me for the past year. I never know what to do with a pluralized word that requires [[small caps]]. I have inquired within the pages of Elements, Chicago Manual, and a few type books back from school.</p>
<p>Take for instance the words TVs or GMOs. Should they be set like this;</p>
<p>&lt; sc &gt; TV &lt; /sc &gt; s
&lt; sc &gt; GMO &lt; /sc &gt; s</p>
<p>Or should all the letters be set in small caps? My art director says that we should just leave them capitalized (TVs GMOs) and ignore the small caps in this instance. I, by nature, push back against him. Thoughts, guidelines, rules, opinions … anything would do. Take care.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on stuff like that &ndash; I&rsquo;m assuming you have a U.S.-oriented style/spelling guide &ndash; and bumping up the small caps as you mention is likely the best solution to your specific problem.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are many ways that small caps can work.
A typeface would need at least THREE kinds (i.e. three different heights) to satisy them all.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Sc_5105.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is probably the most useful, noticeably taller than lower-case x-height. Good for acronyms, and still plenty of size contrast with full caps (unless the full capitals are smallish). Also a good size for Cyrillic small caps, where Maxim Zhukov has argued that size differentiation from lower case is helpful, given the commonality of so many letter forms between the Cyrillic upper and lower case, and the few extenders, especially in Russian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These could be termed <em>moyen</em> caps and petite caps. The petite caps are the same height as lower-case x-height. Moyen caps would be larger than small caps, to allow sufficient contrast with petite caps for setting this kind of titular alphabet soup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A traditional way of setting petite caps, with copious lettespacing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A fourth size of small caps (bébé?) might be necessary to deal with &ldquo;Mc/Mac&rdquo; names that are set in all small caps, although this is so infrequent that the typographer should best handle it by tweaking, rather than with a separate font. If foundries wish to remedy the situation in-font, perhaps just two glyphs, &ldquo;Scots A and C for small caps&rdquo;, would do the job.</p>
<p>Another issue is ordinals and superiors&ndash;occasionally, typographers may wish to set these in capital letter style.</p>
<p>So, my thinking is that the ultimate solution would be to include small caps in the main font, and have a separate Caps font, which contains moyen and petite cap sizes at the basic upper and lower case keystrokes, and also has superiors that are capital in form.</p>
<p>With this configuration, the difficult titles (B.Des etc.) could be set entirely with the Caps font, simplifying that chore for the typographer. Small caps could also be included, so that it would be possible to set both moyen caps with petite caps (basic &ldquo;upper and lower&rdquo; keystrokes) and moyen caps with small caps (small caps feature applied), as separate styles.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I&rsquo;m repeating myself without realizing it! (Doesn&rsquo;t everyone?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with Atma. It&rsquo;s nicely done, but not the kind of conservative design I would have looked at twice in 2001, or subsequently recognize in use, and I probably didn&rsquo;t notice the multi-small-caps, as that&rsquo;s something that has only really interested me since I started working in OpenType. Thanks for bringing it to my attention Stephen.</p>
<p>I see that Atma is pre-OpenType, and has Small Caps = Petite Caps, Mid Caps = Small Caps, and Quarter Caps = &ldquo;Moyen&rdquo; Caps.
Presumably its terminology was adopted prior to an awareness of how things shaped up in the OpenType Feature Tag specifications.
I wonder how Atma&rsquo;s various small caps will be implemented in OpenType&hellip;</p>
