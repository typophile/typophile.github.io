  from the 70's.\r\nIt came from the \"Handbook Of Freestyle Skateboard Tricks\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freestyle_4677.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  noticed it also shares similar characteristics of the typeface on the Letraset catalog
  cover, only the \"Freestyle\" typeface has fewer lines.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letra_6587.jpg]"

    I'm guessing it's a variant of the Stripes family. Does anybody know where I can
    find these at?"
