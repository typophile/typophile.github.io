body: Hello there, <BR> <BR>As far as I can see, this forum is sponsored by FontLab,
  which is good...the thing that bothers me is that I need a batch font conversion
  utility &#40;TTF to PS1&#41;, possibly shareware or &#40;even better&#41; freeware.
  I suppose, this question was asked before here, but the search feature is not the
  strongest &amp; brightest feature of the forum software. <BR> <BR>Any help will
  be appreciated

    scripting mode, so you could do a batch conversion. As far as I know, it runs
    under cygwin-X11 on windows.

  body: FontDoctor will convert fonts. It can be purchased separately but it often
    bundled with Suitcase.  <BR> <BR>The latest version supposedly will convert to
    OT but I suspect this would only be useful on single fonts &#40;as opposed to
    trying to incorporate families or expert fonts into a superfont&#41;.
