  body: '&#62;Does it change in the time? Or is it a style?  <BR> <BR>AFAIK, both.
    IIRC, the pilcrow was originally based on the letter &#34;c&#34; &#40;see Jenson&#41;.
    Don&#39;t remember why exactly. The &#34;modern&#34; pilcrow have two thin vertical
    strokes, but I don&#39;t why either...'

  body: 'Thanks for digging up that link, Eduardo. <BR> <BR>The Pilcrow is a great
    character to get creative with. The one thing to keep in mind though is this:
    it might seem intuitive to make it match the color of the alphabetic characters
    in the font, but this ruins its functionality. The Pilcrow <i>has</i> to be dark
    to work right. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thanks, Eduardo and Hrant. <BR> <BR>Pilcrow! I&#39;ve never know this mark&#39;s
    name. <BR> <BR>I create the typeface now. I thought that I had to arrange the
    color of a typeface, and the color of a sign. Suppose I made the typeface of an
    old style, I had to combine the sign of an old style, and thought that a modern
    style had to make the sign of a modern style. <BR> <BR>I have to study more and
    more. I&#39;m interested in Parkes&#39;s book &#34;Pause and Effect: An Introduction
    to the History of Punctuation in the West&#34; .'
