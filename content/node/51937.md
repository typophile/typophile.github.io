body: What do you all think of this face being used as the font for a type heavy,
  tire ad campaign that's trying to sell to women? I'm recommending that the client
  use a more grotesk or geometric sans with a serif if they want an secondary typeface.
  Any comments on this Caramella font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caramella_4755.jpg]

  body: I agree with your though train. I am not sure about these being a leading
    type face. pretty face but kind of airy.

  body: Oh and one more thing, there are no other weights or styles. This is it. Just
    Regular! So I'm thinking for an all type ad I should have more options for weights?

  body: I think you're on the right track - geometric sans makes more sense. Something
    like this is more cosmetics/fashion. I wouldn't use this if I had the choice.
    It looks like a students work. No offense.
