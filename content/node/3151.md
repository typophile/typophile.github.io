  body: 'Hello Maarten <BR> <BR>looks nice to me but needs a lot of work I guess!
    Did you have it in biger gif? maybe Flash or PDF? <BR> <BR>Book: <BR>The diagonal
    line of the UC &#39;Z&#39; is to bold. Guess it its the gif but the steams have
    diffrent with- Look at LC &#39;i&#39; and &#39;n&#39;. The &#39;c&#39; seams to
    closed. Open it more like &#39;e&#39; <BR> <BR>UC &#39;H&#39; and &#39;E&#39;:
    The middle horizontal line is in my eyes to high. <BR>UC &#39;Q&#39;: The Tail
    .. uh its not my favorit but is also not the ugliest ;-&#41; Maybe you should
    try some other solutions. <BR>UC &#39;N&#39;: The width is to small I guess <BR>UC
    &#39;M&#39; and &#39;V&#39;: It seams that the inner is the same.. I dont like
    it and the bottom edge need to be more left. <BR>UC &#39;P&#39;: I like this semi-lowercase
    caracter ot the top-left <BR>Also Bottom-left of &#39;B&#39; and &#39;D&#39; <BR>UC
    &#39;S&#39;: leans to the left... Maybe you have to him a crook ;-&#41; just a
    joke &#42;g&#42; <BR> <BR>Okay I will stop here otherwise u maybe get fustratated
    ...  <BR>Typedesign should make fun and not work! ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Greets Jens'

  body: The W is so wide, it seems like it was dropped in from a different typeface.
    Try remaking the W from scratch, looking at the M for comparison. The hooky descenders
    are interesting; the j is the best-formed one and you may want to just transplant
    it to the others.

  body: Nice, Maarten. <BR>I just don&#39;t think that the curvy legs on hmn are working.
    <BR>The f is falling to the left and the j is too exaggerated.

  body: This is much better than the first iteration. <BR>Your descenders seem to
    be of unequal depth, but in this case I think that&#39;s actually a great feature.

  body: i agree with Eduardo. curves a bit bit extreme. Otherwise a nice piece of
    work. <BR> <BR>Ooops. I promised myself never to use the word &#34;extreme&#34;
    as it belongs to the WWF type&#39;s vocabulary.
