body: "I've found this in a company logo made around 2006, for which no one longer
  has access to a postscript source. I've been able to find a source for the main
  graphics part, but not for these letters. They seems a bit like a Futura font, but
  the 'S' is quite different and moreover I can't find a condensed version of it.
  I've tried the Vista and the Frutiger, but there's always a noticeable difference,
  epecially for the 'S', the 'O' and the 'N', which appears to be pointed. \r\n\r\nI
  attach the best bitmap I have of that part of the logo. \r\n\r\nIs there anyone
  who recognizes it ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for your help !\r\n\r\nPanros"

  body: "Good point, oldnick, but even if manually condensed, the 'S' of Futura Book
    wouldn't look the same.\r\n\r\nAnd NJ, I was looking at Trebuchet right now, but
    I can't find a condensed version. Maybe it has been condensed manually... I'll
    give it a try, and I'll post the results..."

    condensed font, and NJ, thank-you for the suggestion about the Trebuchet font
    !\r\n\r\nI only have an MS Trebuchet version available, but I've been able to
    reproduce the logo graphics with an 86 pts reduced at 82%.\r\n\r\nHats off ! I'm
    amazed at the speed at which you've been able to help me !\r\n\r\nA thousand times
    Thank-You !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Solutions_Trebuchet_3512.png]"
