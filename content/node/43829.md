body: "Happy Spring!\r\n\r\nJust like an explosion of Spring flowers comin' up from
  'neath the soil, we've got a whole mess of fantastic and BRAND NEW FONTS for you
  and a NEW FOUNDRY!\r\n\r\nThe Font Bros are pleased to announce the addition of
  Alison Argento's Dear Alison font foundry, a tribute to handwritten correspondance
  styles we're sure you'll love!\r\n\r\nDear Allison - Gladly Mailed is a cursive
  handwritten font inspired by old correspondence. It has been built in OpenType format
  and includes custom letter pairs to swap double capitals, double lowercase, and
  double number pairs with custom ligature variations as you type to create a more
  randomized look. Check it out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-GLMA\r\n\r\nDear
  Allison - Smiley is a spunky little sign-painteresque font, ideal for childrens
  books, posters, etc. Check out this fun number at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-SMIL\r\n\r\nCBDO
  - Louisiana originated from the lovely handwriting style of Melanie Snedeker. Lettering
  Artist Charles Borges de Oliveira then refined the letter forms to produce this
  one of a kind handwriting script. When you need a legible handwriting font, Louisiana
  is the perfect choice. Check it out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=CBDO-LOUI\r\n\r\nOutside
  the Line - Dearest John is the first font in the Love Letters series from Outside
  the Line. It is a bouncy hand lettered font. If you type caps and lower case you
  get one look. If you type all caps you get another look. Kind of 2 fonts for the
  price of one. Check it out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=OUTL-DEJO\r\n\r\nHarold's
  Fonts - This month must be super special as Harold unleashes not one but TWO NEW
  MONOGRAM FONTS! Clover Monograms and Heart Monograms! Each monogram set contains
  full 2 and 3 letter monogram combinations and the Heart Monogram set allows the
  ability for black on white or white on black monograms. Both contain a choice of
  several fantastic decorative frames. Check 'em both out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-CLMO
  and http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-HEMO\r\n\r\nSideshow
