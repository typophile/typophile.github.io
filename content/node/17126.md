  body: "I made a comment to the blog, but it hasn't shown up yet. Based on the suggested
    form illustrated, I suggested that the Arabic question mark character could be
    used in English text to indicate irony, perhaps prompting the Arabs to use the
    European question mark for the same purpose <code>\u061F</code>\r\n\r\nMisunderstood
    irony is, after all, a kind of bidirectional confusion of intent and intepretation."

  body: "No, using the Arabic question mark, except in humour and without warranty
    of results, is not a good idea, as I tried to suggest in my comment to Kevin's
    piece and as Michael Kaplan notes in his own blog response. Characters have directionality
    properties, and these can cause all sorts of behaviour depending on their own
    directionality, the directionality and relative directional strength of adjacent
    characters, and directionality of the document or paragraph. You wouldn't want
    to introduce an 'irony' mark in the middle of some English text and have subsequent
    text ordered to the left of the mark. It is a relatively unlikely outcome, but
    the possibility exists.\r\n\r\nAnother concern would be that some applications
    try to get clever with mirroring Arabic punctuation, which is a real headache
    already because no one seems to agree on how this should be done correctly. What
    happens, for example, if you hit the [ key when an Arabic keyboard driver is active
    when typing in Arabic, are you indicating that you want a left bracket or are
    you indicating that you want an opening bracket, which in Arabic would by a right
    bracket? I've seen both interpretations, and I can imagine similar confusion about
    the ? key arising if people start using both Arabic and European question marks
    in the same language."

    href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencken\">H.L. Mencken</a> (after whom JFP
    named the new typefaces for the Baltimore Sun). Mencken wasn't the paper's founder
    (the paper dates back to at least the early 1800s). He was an editor during the
    first half of the 20th century, and was one of the centuries most influential
    american writers and journalists.\r\n\r\nHe suggested the irony slant be added
    to the Linotype machine's (?) offering of faces, because he saw Americans as being
    incapable of understanding humor."
