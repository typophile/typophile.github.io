body: "I have very specific questions about some glyphs from the [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|font]]
  I'm developing. Any help is highly welcome.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 1:
  New Sheqel.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhich must be the height for Israeli's New Sheqel in
  a Latin script? I see New Sheqel is quite small in Times New Roman, a font with
  Hebrew script. But it follows general currency height in Greta Text, a font without
  Hebrew script. I believe the height must align to Hebrew glyphs if they are present,
  but it can align with Dollar, Euro and others symbols when Latin alphabet is used.
  Is this supposion true?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q1_5586.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question
  2: Drachma.</strong>\r\n\r\nDrachma symbol is calligraphic and very similar in most
  fonts. In my project, I did some small changes to achieve a result coherent with
  font general approach \u2013and also use the same angle of italic style. This small
  redesign is allowed according to Greek standards?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q2_3961.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question
  3: Vietnamese circumflex+grave.</strong>\r\n\r\nIn Vietnamese, the combined accent
  circumflex+grave uses grave at right or left? I found both ways in various fonts,
  but it seems that to put grave at left is better.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q3_5606.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question
  4: K hook.</strong>\r\n\r\nK with upper hook is used in some African languages.
  For uppercase K, there are fonts with the hook at the stem and others with it at
  the upper leg. Any idea about the correct/best choice?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q4_4985.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question
  5: German Sharp S.</strong>\r\n\r\nActually, two questions here. First: is the sample
  below a good design to German sharp S? Second: German sharp S as a single glyph
  uses Unicode 1E9E, while SS digraph uses 00DF. Is a good idea to adopt an OpenType
  substitution from Uni00DF to Uni1E9E when German language is in use?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q5_3486.gif]\r\n\r\n."

    Make it more familiar to the ductus of the Hebrew letters. Height? A worthy question.
    Consider the combination with the figures, which ought to go well. Height alignement
    with $ \xA3 \u20AC etc. is not obligatory, in my view.\r\n\r\n#2:\r\nDrop this

  body: "Thanks a lot for all answers. I'll take your advices in account to improve
    New Sheqel and sharp S immediately. Let me add some considerations about the other
    questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Drachma</strong>:\r\n\r\nYou did touch an interesting
    issue, Andreas. Although this symbol is not currently used, don't it must be keeped
    for historic reasons? At last, Drachma was Greece's currency for long time. I
    see the same for other European national currencies whose were replaced by Euro
    (exception to Franc symbol, still used in African countries).\r\n\r\nA similar
    situation occurs with Cruzeiro (Uni20A2), wrongly reported by Unicoed as in-use
    Brazilian currency. This symbol was dropped in 1967 and almost no one knows it
    in Brazil nowadays. Anyway, many fonts brings the symbol. The only logical reason
    for this is historic reference (although I believe many designers include it just
    because Unicode does).\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vietnamese</strong>:\r\n\r\nI already
    knew the thread about Vietnamese diacritics, but there is no conclusion there
    about the grave position. An user (hdang) seems to know Vietnamese languase and
    says Minion solution is bad. As Minion uses the grave at right, the correct would
    be grave at left. But this user did not come back to confirm this.\r\n\r\nBoth
    options are equally strange to my Western eye. So I'd like to know how Vietnamese
    people actually prefer it.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>K hook</strong>:\r\n\r\nI agree
    with riccard0, K with hook at leg is more distinct from regular K. But again,
    how African people use it? Maybe this is the more dificult question as we have
    very few information about African languages even here in Typophile."

  body: "1. As noted by others, the serifs make this shape too complex. I'd make this
    the same height as Hebrew letters, which by long convention are most often between
    x-height and cap height relative to Latin. Note, however, that some modern Israeli
    fonts match Hebrew letters to the Latin cap height.\r\n\r\n3. Both conventions
    are seen in use in Vietnam, in type and in writing. I prefer the grave on the
    left of the circumflex because at small sizes and low resolutions it is more distinct,
    so aids legibility.\r\n\r\n4. I spent a lot of time researching African orthographies
    in the late '90s. The hook on the right arm is by far the most common form of
    this letter; in fact, I don't recall seeing the other form at all. This requires
    a strong hook form in order to be clearly legible and distinct from the regular
    K at small sizes."

    to go for a more Latinish shaping. This aspect has been debated upon here not
    so long ago.\r\n\r\nCapital Eszett: the right part is still too light. Weight
    distribution is \uFB01ne, though. But the upper part may have some little more

  body: "my 2 cents regarding the New Shekel: (more as a Hebrew speaker, not a type
    designer)\r\nAs mentioned, some Hebrew faces are leveled to match Latin Cap height,
    some to X-height, and some in between. If your font does not include Hebrew script,
    then the Shekel symbol would only appear next to figures, so no reason to make
    it different then any other currency symbol. It will never appear next to Hebrew
    text because every Hebrew typeface has its own New Shekel glyph.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the serifs, everything said here was right, but I would try a version with a single
    serif, the one on the top left, which some Hebrew Chet letters do have. Look at
    this example in Fontef's Meargen, you can see both Shin and Chat at the bottom

  body: "Thanks for more valuable inputs.\r\n\r\n<strong>New Sheqel and Rupee</strong>:\r\n\r\n<em>Yotam</em>:
    you touched exactly the question I did ask. As this font uses just Latin script,
    New Sheqel will never be together with Hebrew glyphs so it may look strange with
    its small height. In doubt, I did two versions: the small, traditional one, to
    be used with default, oldstyle and petite figures. And a larger one to be aligned
    with uppercases. Your idea about prtial serifs is interesting, I will do some
    tests.\r\n\r\n<em>Andreas</em>: I believe there is no escape from a somewhat strange
    appearance as this came from another script. The same would occur with Drachma,
    old German Penny or Rial (although this one I did not include) because these are
    non-Latin glyphs. As you pointed, Rupee has a more Latinish shape. The alternative
    to Sheqel is to adopt a non-traditional design, as I made originally and as one
    finds in Greta Text. But this seem to produce even more strange results.\r\n\r\nI
    made a sample using New Sheqel and other monetary symbols.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sheqel_5861.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\nThis
    sample is far from ideal as there are distortions due to screen resolution. In
    both texts (rates table and small note) I used, in order, default number set,
    oldstyle figures and all caps figures. Table uses tabular figures, remaining texts
    are proportional."
