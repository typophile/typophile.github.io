    have a look at Effra from Dalton Maag:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/dalton_maag/effra_standard_ot/\r\n\r\nTo
    me Effra seems to be the sleeper font Gotham alternatives. Its reminds of Maag\u2019s
    work for Tote which was based on PL Bernhardt and perhaps a dash of Avenir.\r\n\r\nMike

  body: Effra is a good call, whereas Nobel is quite different due to the much lower
    x-height. <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/">Museo Sans</a>
    might be another alternative for either Avenir or Gotham.
