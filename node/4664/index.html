		<div class="commentbody">Andy you have the same problem your classmates have. Ask your self: Why would anyone know this word/place is a restaurant? The name looks like it could be a night club, plus you gave no explaination of the type of restaurant it is. Is it McDonalds or Le Cirque, is it French or Asian. The logo means nothing without brand idenity. So make it painfully clear its about food and the kind of place it is.</div>

Unfortunate for his/her students, but regardless, the students can still do the quality work for themselves regardless of how low the standards the teacher places on passing or even good grades. <BR> <BR> <BR>Here is am example of some work I did a few years ago. that I think is nice and well though out. Exterior circular logo was not designed by me . My task was to improve and build upon what was existing-at the lowest cost possible. <BR> <BR>I would expect you can tell a lot about this place (price point, atmosphere, services/products, etc&hellip;) without any written explanation.  <BR> <BR>It is a hip coffeebar, they show art, they serve great coffee,  <BR>they offer crepes and waffles for breakfast. Neighbor hood is  <BR>Belltown, just north of Seattles' downtown business district, urban, somewhat stylish clients. Simple. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35445.jpg" alt="lux"> <BR> <BR>boxed &quot;X&quot; is closed sign, Lux logo was re-created as interior identity/art with flourescent lights-simple, cheap post modern. <BR>Food icons were placed on windows in vinyl by entrance.Top image was postcard. (mechanical shark may look familiar it was  <BR>on MTV for a while after someone from thee saw it at the cafe and licensed artist for use on MTV)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll also agree with Daniel; to me, a restaurant's identity is one location where the average customer should not notice flashy design or excellent typography. Of course the identity package you create must match the style and intended use of the restaurant, but 'overdesigning' risks appearing contrived.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Roh. I read your critique.My reply- The Lux work is supposed to look minimalist (or generic as you described it). Lux is located between upscale independent clothing stores and restaurants. It is not supposed to look expensive (nor inexpensive). The prices are a bit higher than most cafes ( as well as quality), but it was not owners desire to specifically express the aspect. This is Seattle and most people do not care if it costs a bit more. People wanting Starbucks or Tullys can walk a block in any direction and find either (again this is Seattle). Lux is different from both of these large Espresso mega chains. Lux venue is sometimes host to a variety of events from Dj music nights, poetry, art openings, etc. But none of these events are on regular schedules, nor part of Lux's core business.  <BR>The identity has served the client well for the last few years. Besides, it's businesscard (which features logo) was recently published in a graphic design book &quot; Best of Businesscards 6&quot; from Rockport Publishing, so I guess at least some industry folks find it is attractive and functional sincve it was picked over 1000's of other entries.  Their older logo is shown below. At the time this logo was used, furniture was mostly handmade wrought iron, and place had more of a casual &quot;artsy&quot; feeling. This was partially changed because people would hang out all day and buy less. New identity and interior changes improved sales and brought profits up to help owner sell business which was her desire with the changes. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35521.jpg" alt="old lux"></div>

Even at the student level. Granted, a lot of this depends on the quality of the particular professor. When I was in school, I was fortunate enough to have professors that spent as much time teaching us the art of critique as they did teaching us the art of design&hellip;not to mention the art of presenting our own work. <BR> <BR>A lot of the restaurant logo posts in here have been 'this is a logo I made for a restaurant. What do you think?' which is WAY to vague to be of any use to anyone giving a critique. As such, it seemes as if critiques were not being done in-class. <BR> <BR>Again&hellip;this in no way is meant as a critique of these students&hellip;I just found it a bit odd that it was happening.</div>
