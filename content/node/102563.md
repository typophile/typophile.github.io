  have found Thomas Phinney's article [http://forums.adobe.com/thread/395648], among
  others [http://typophile.com/node/19625] to be most helpful. YET I still can't get
  my head around writing the feature so that it creates a more 'random' outcome.\r\n\r\nThe
  details are:\r\n\u2013 x3 variants for all characters \r\n\u2013 x3 classes [00
  / 01 / 02] including one of each character, 79 characters in total [A\u2013Z, a\u2013z,
  0-9, punctuation]\r\n\u2013 feature currently looks like:\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\nlookup
  calt_one {\r\nsub @set_00 @set_00' by @set_01;\r\nsub @set_01 @set_00' by @set_02;\r\n}
  calt_one;\r\n\r\nlookup calt_two {\r\nsub @set_02 @set_00' by @set_02;\r\nsub @set_01
  @set_02' by @set_00;\r\nsub @set_01 @set_00' by @set_02;\r\nsub @set_00 @set_01'
  by @set_02;\r\n} calt_two;\r\n\r\nsub @set_00 space @set_00' by @set_01;\r\nsub
  @set_01 space @set_00' by @set_02;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\n\u2013 the result being:\r\n\r\n00
  \ 02  02  02  01  00  00  02  02  02  01  00 ...\r\n\r\n+ after a 'space' the pattern
  resets\r\n\r\n\u2013 I also have a fourth alternate for a handful of characters.
  I've not yet put them into the equation, is this something that is possible or do
  I have to have the same number of alternates for each character regarding this contextual
  random feature?\r\n\r\nI just wondered if it's seemingly obvious what the mistake
  is that i'm making, and if anyone could possible help...?!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nemma"
