body: This is one of 5 posters I did for a global studies presentation on the internet.
  I made a poster for every topic I covered in the presentation, this particular one
  is for social connectivity, and idea exchange through the internet. Let me know
  what you think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1-3_4203.png]

    one of a lighter color. I would make the contours and the \"screws\" in the bulbs
    of a grey color, if you like that.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
