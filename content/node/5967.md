    job at it.

  body: 'The lower case looks exactly like Spumoni, and the upper case looks like
    Spumoni with added/modified serifs. I agree with Mark. <BR> <BR>For comparison,
    there are three other commercial fonts that have a strong stylistic resemblance
    to Spumoni &#40;none of them match the samples&#41;: <BR><a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=SD10101"

    of Type-O-Tones &#40;sample follows&#41;. Sniff has the most &#39;embellishment&#39;,
    but has the same sort of casual feel that I get from Spumoni. <BR> <BR>The Nick
    Curtis font is all caps and is based &#40;apparently&#41; on Goudy Stout, which
    it resembles, with added bounce. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42310.gif"

  body: Thanks for the help guys. This is very interesting. Why not just use Spumoni?
    It&#39;s relatively cheap and readily available, especially for a commercial product
    like a movie cover. Is there perhaps another Spumoni knockoff floating around
    somewhere? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the full cover, BTW.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42336.jpg"

  body: Licorice from Bright Ideas seems to match. According to <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/originalfonts.html">Luc&#39;s
    free fonts page</a>, Bright Ideas fonts came bundled with a magazine. I think
    they were mostly knockoffs, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;d find them now. <BR>
