body: "Hi, I've been looking for this font and I'm hoping someone could identify it
  for me?  I've already seen a lot of similar looking fonts, but I was hoping to find
  this one specifically.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/salvador.png\"></image>\r\n\r\nThe
  font originally appeared in the Sweet Valley Junior High series published 1999.
  \ It should be an actual font, since the series used other fonts for display type,
  like Spring Light and Longhand.\r\n\r\nI guess the font's most notable feature is
  probably what the lowercase 'v' looks like in the sample; it really arches all the
  way over on the right side.  The 'tails' on the lowercase 'a' and 'd' stood out
  for me, and I guess maybe the 'dot' in the lowercase 'o'.  \r\n\r\nThank you for
  any help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on the face of it: the use of other, identifiable fonts doesn't preclude the use
    of hand-lettering as well. However, you're probably right in this case, since
    the \"a\" appears to be identical in both instances."
