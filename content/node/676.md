    <BR> <BR>Would it be embarassing if I admitted that this was the very first font
    I ever bought? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: David, if you bought it while it was still called Manson, then, far from embarrassing,
    it would be like you had an extremely limited release!

  body: Ha ha David. I guess it&#39;s a little embarassing. <BR> <BR>But <a href="http://66.70.183.115/fonts/fontshow/db.cgi?db=default&amp;uid=default&amp;ID=33003&amp;ww=on&amp;view_records=View%2BRecords">this</a>
    is the first font I bought. Even more embarassing, I think. And worse, I never
    used it once.  <BR>
