  the forum but didn't get much chance there.\r\nSo I'm gonna try the logotype section,
  which fits the subject a lot better anyway :\r\nI'm designing a logotype for a photographer
  (KSG).\r\nHere is where I am right now.\r\nMore \"refinements\" coming up, but would
  love to hear your thoughts at this stage of the work.\r\n\r\nThanx\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ishot-9_5757.jpg]"

  body: "Hum I don't think I want it to be more clearer (the camera lens) I want this
    to be more suggestive than illustrative.\r\nI'm having problems fixing the K and
    the G's balance though\u2026"

  body: The K looks clumsy and awkward. Since you told us this is a logo for a photographer,
    I can guess that the big circle with the S is representative of the camera lens,
    however it's not really clear what it is and therefore may be confusing to the
    uninformed.

  body: "I don't know if it's the odd shape of the letter K in this or what, but I
    couldn't help but think KGB as I read KSG.\r\n\r\nI also didn't get the camera
    thing until you mentioned it, now I see it but I have to say the imagery isn't
    the strongest.\r\n\r\nThere's potential here for sure.  I find that to my eyes,
    the K and the G work together, the S feels all alone and no a part of the rest,
    and the name below again feels way too small, and dijointed from the rest.\r\n\r\nI
    think if you unify your type choice a little more you might bring some cohesion
    into the design as a whole and make it read a little better (at least to me)\r\n\r\nI
    think it has a way to go yet, so keep working on it, you can certainly turn this
    into something beautiful!"
