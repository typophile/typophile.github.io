  I'm looking to get some feedback on a font I'm working on ... right now I only have
  the caps.  \r\n\r\nThe font is nameless as of yet, but inspired by the quote 'my
  favorite part was everything.' Some little kid on TV was talking about how Shaq
  came to visit his elementary school or something like that.\r\n\r\nhttp://anythinganymore.com/_/misc/newletters.gif\r\n\r\nThanks~!"

  body: "The stroke ends on the W, R, X, Y are similar but the decision to angle the
    ends seems arbitrary. I'm not saying that you need to give all strokes the same
    angle but the rule is inconsistent. Sometimes that's cute but in this case it's
    not.\r\n\r\nS is tough. It looks kind of congested on the top and it's overall
    heavier than most other letters. I recommend printing it out and tracing over
    it in pencil. You can fix it by poking beziers around but it's easy to end up
    with something that looks generic. Expect to spend lots of time on the S.\r\n\r\nX
    is tough. Split it into three pieces. A solid piece like this: / and the other
    half \\ split at the waist. So you've got one / and two short \\ \\. Move the
    shirt \\\\ into position until they look right. Test with other letter and X words.
    Don't measure, just move them until they look good to you. Remove overlaps. select
    points and arrow key tap* them until you have a perfect X. Get frustrated and
    start all over again.\r\n\r\nK is tough. It seems that you want to contain K in
    its own \"square\". That's fine but it creates limitation on the structure. Right
    now the foot tapers.\r\n\r\nV is not tough. Arrow key tap the crotch point down
    a bit. arrow key tap the top to make the strokes slightly wider. Compare with
    other letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* select a point and play bongos on the arrow keys"

  body: "This font has a nice warm feel :)\r\n\r\nI'm no expert at all (and excuse
    my lack of fluency in the language of type design), I'll build on the suggestions
    made by typodermic. \r\nFrom here I can see that your 'H' is too squished and
    too light. Make it wider and increase the stroke widths a little. Compare it to
    the 'W' which is really heavy \u2013 too heavy. \r\nYour 'G' looks a little odd,
    the round is light and the top terminal has an odd shape and angle. Also the foot
    (?) of the 'G' feels a little big and possibly too high. I think the curve 'J'
    needs some condensing. \r\nIt feels like the 'C' overshoots the baseline and cap-height
    a bit much \u2013 it's really noticeable against the 'D'.\r\nI like the tail of
    the 'Q' and perhaps there's something there that can help you with the 'K'.\r\nI
    like the 'R' but it feels a tiny bit top-heavy so the leg needs to come out a
    little more perhaps, and address the heavy mass that's happening where the leg
    joins."
