body: "& (the ampersand) is a ligature for 'et', latin for 'and'. Although archaic
  you can use '&c' the same as 'etc' as a shortened 'Et cetera'. & (the ampersand)
  being a ligature for 'et', I am curious to whether there are any historical examples
  of ligatures being designed for 'etc'.\r\n\r\nI created an example of what a ligature
  for 'etc' could look like: http://bit.ly/cKOH8v\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any actual
  historical examples?"
