  where i currently work and live.\r\n\r\nIn the last 2 months i've been working on
  a concept for a fashion, beauty and lifestyle magazine (size: 230mmx290mm) for women
  and in the last days i came back to the issue of typeface for logo.\r\nCheck the
  attached image and tell me what word do you read? Are there some letters that you
  hardly understand? Some people say the typeface i used (bodoni poster) is too bold
  for a magazine for women but i tried to stand out and do smth different from magazines
  like vogue, elle, l'officiel, bazaar, plus you can see that the magazine name is
  way long and strange :) that pushes me to search for a good readable typeface.\r\nAny
  other suggestions of typefaces?\r\nWhat typefaces you think about when i say women,
  fashion, beauty, lifestyle?\r\n\r\nnamy thanks,\r\nDumitru"

    guess you took the whole image I attached as a design. I tried to show there just

    it is about style and silhouette :)\r\n\r\n@naoiseo \r\nWyld looks great, and

    increase the contrast in Stiluette. Contrast is about the difference between thin
    and bold parts of a character, not the weight of the typeface (so Helvetica Ultra
    Light has naearly no contrast and modern typefaces as Didot, Bodoni has it plenty).
    See images below. BTW I quite like your cover sample.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/before_4076.jpg]\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/after_5315.jpg]\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nA."

  body: "@ dumitru\r\n\r\nThe strokes of the modified letters of your logo become
    thinner and thinner now, while Urquell sets the point, from which the strokes
    become thin earlier and then the stroke width does not change anymore. Thin it
    down, till it hurts, may be a bit overdone, but calligraphically it was better
    in Urquell\u2019s example. I miss the correct terms, but I hope it is clear enough,
    what I mean."

  body: "With everything so tight, the counters in the \"e\"s become too open.\r\nI
    would recommend narrowing both the top counter, and also the width of the right
    stroke, and possibly opening the i_l_u letterspace by a small amount (or, alternatively,
    increasing the space inside the \"u\"), for a better overall colour/tone.\r\n\r\nYou
    see, the relative stroke widths and negative space within \"u\" and \"e\" are
    designed for text setting small, with normal tracking. They are designed to be
    different from one another, so that text matter doesn't become too grey. However,
    in an ultra-tight display setting, these differences become a liability, nbot
    an asset.\r\n\r\nBy the way, is there some other way to deal with the Abreve accent,
    for settings with negative leading?"
