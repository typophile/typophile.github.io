body: Hello everyone, <BR>I&#39;ve been asking around about the name of this typeface.
  I&#39;ve been seeing it pop up in GQ, and Vanity Fair and random magazine publications.
  But i first spotted it in a Cuban Cigar Box book. Also, if anyone knows where i
  can get a copy for mac, that would be greatly appreciated. <BR>-Crystal<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63803.jpg"
