  before mini-monograms (unsure of the correct term too) used to mark the end of a
  story.\r\n\r\nShould the period be disregarded?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."

  body: Several publications have this type of symbol to mark the end of an article...
    Usually the  last sentence in the story ends with the period or other punctuation
    mark, followed by an en- or em-space, followed by the monogram, as you call it,
    or symbol (usually it can be made into a single font character with Fontographer
    or FontLab, and typed into the story).
