body: "I have an .indb file connecting several layout documents into one \u201Cbook\u201D.
  The forelast of these doc.s ranges up to page 430 in the actual layout and in the
  pages palette. But in the .indb list this document conts up to page 440. Hence the
  numbering of the subsequent doc. commences wrongly with p. 441.\r\n\r\nHas anyone
  a clue to this?"

    and maybe there is a reason for that other than poor implementation. Anyway at
    least it warns you when you\u2019re exporting it."

    Book feature can be used to achieve a number of multiple document changes.\r\n\r\nFor
    example: you can use it to harmonize styles between several docs, you can build
    a book just to print, package or preflight dozens of separate files at once, you
    can synchronize colours, conditional texts and variables or you can just export
    a group of individual files to a single PDF. In all these situations, page number
    update may be undesired.\r\n\r\nSo, the way Book works is actually adequate to
    the many goals it can afford."
