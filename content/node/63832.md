  today decided to join in, i'm a first year graphic design student and was wondering
  if maybe someone here could help me out on \"how to\" do a retro or old style kind
  of effect in indesign. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nedwright6_5195.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni
  tried doing this with type on path but i get a completely different look, here it
  looks as if the type is already slanted and put on a path (maybe?) I'm really still
  figuring allot of Indesign out and learning as i go, really hope you fine people
  could give me some good pointers on how to achieve this effect\r\n\r\nAlso if someone
  knows witch font is being used that would be cherry's on top  \r\n\r\nAppreciate
  all the help!!"

  body: "To help illustrate what is going on let's rotate the text back to a straight
    line for a moment. As you'll see the text is 'skewed' to the right... in this
    case 20 degrees. After the skew has been applied the text block is rotated 20
    degrees to match the skew angle. This will keep the vertical alignment of the
    type at 90 degrees while producing the results you desire.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Press-Tutorial_5788.gif]"

  body: The typeface has a similar feeling to <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=83">Brothers</a>
    from Emigre but not exact. <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/kirsty/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D66%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPRESS%2520PRINTED%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Cot.liga%26seed%3D22">Kristy</a>
    is another and right for the college budget.
