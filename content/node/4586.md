body: 'Did anybody else receive this beautiful new mail order catalog? An elegant
  serif typeface is used throughout. &#40;Sorry, it&#39;s text size only and too small
  to upload a scan.&#41; It&#39;s got oldstyle numerals &#40;descenders drop below
  the baseline&#41;. It&#39;s most idiosyncratic quirk: the cap Es look like numeral
  3s -- sort of like Emigre&#39;s Tarzana face, only this is an oldstyle serif font.
  &#40;It doesn&#39;t appear on either the Nordstrom or Tommy Bahama web site either.
  I already checked.&#41; Can anybody help identify this beautiful typeface?'

  body: Fine, but since we can&#39;t see the sample we&#39;re supposed to be identifying,
    this is kind of a hopeless exercise.

  body: Eplica is close &#40;and good looking&#41; but not the face used in this catalog.
    The cap Rs in Eplica  are &#34;unattached&#34; and curl upward at the bottom,
    unlike this face. Sorry, I was not able to view the Assembly EPS. I&#39;ll see
    if I can view it online somewhere.

    an unshown serif typeface as described in the first post.
