body: Identity for Buddha Jewelry, large guage tribal jewelry hand crafted in Bali.
  materials- stone, jade, bamboo, coconut shell, mother of pearl, wood and buffalo
  horn -for the modern primitive. Rush job- 9 days. 8 pages. Identity, in-house photography,
  print collateral, print management. This client rules- paying fair rates, good communication
  and creative freedom. Wish there had been more time. Things can be less than perfect
  doing 18-28hr. work sessions, with 2-4 hour naps <BR>inbetween. Thank Buddha for
  espresso. Images shown do not have final SKU numbers or titles which just arrived
  this morning. <BR>+++ jpeg +++ 34681 +++  <BR>Identity-type +++<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34689.jpg"

    Also, the H-A stroke is beautiful.

  body: Ole, nice work in the time frame you accepted. My only negative comment is
    way too much photoshop cuteness. Did you really have to mess with the models face?
    Upside love the logo.

    have a few issues with the web site interface, but as a mockup, it works.

  body: I&#39;d partially concur with Daniel in that I think the time spent in image
    manipulation grants a nicely polished air to the comps as a whole, but that the
    grunginess on her face isn&#39;t necessary. I do, however, like the overlay to
    highlight the product in her ear. <BR> <BR>Maybe do some subdued texturing in
    a bar behind the &#34;Tribal Jewelry Catalog...&#34; tagline to enhance visibility.
    And perhaps move the navigation on the web interface to the right of the logo
    to enlarge the active user pane for better usability. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, everything
    is great

  body: Very nice. All very nice. To me everything is balanced really well. Just the
    model&#39;s nose is too small. And those black twisty things are killer - almost
    as sexy as that HA ligature... Did I mention it&#39;s all very nice? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, all you need is <strike>holes</strike> piercings in the right places
    ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Ole, that poster is gorgeous. I&#39;d seriously consider reusing
    those patterns elsewhere, like a single colour print on tissue stock for packing
    product or on shopping bags. As for the postcard, I&#39;m sure the flood looks
    fine, keep in mind most postcards don&#39;t look this good.

  body: I thought about redoing color scheme of patterns to mimimic Fendi, Gucci or
    something in that direction. I think this could be fun. Printing for the packaging
    will be done on Bali where these are hand carved. It will be up to client if this
    packaging scheme will fly.  We have great communication, so I am guessing it may
    work out.

  body: It sure is hard keeping up with fashion, I was hoping the camera looks was
    going to last for a while, but now it&#39;s back to tribal jewelry. Anyone looking
    for a nice used camera head attach-ment? All out of film but still has that retro-2001
    look.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34953.jpg" alt="changing
