    designing a type specimen for a friend which means I&#39;m doing it for fun and
    type. It is an opentype font so I thought I&#39;d play off of the word coast.
    That&#39;s all. <BR> <BR>I did try the free translators, but was afraid that the
    word might be taken too literally.

    would spell 0411 0415 0420 0415 0413, and in l.c. 0431 0435 0440 0435 0433.  <BR>
    <BR>Of course, there are other words too, but &#39;bereg&#39;  <BR>sounds the
    snappiest, and looks very elegant, very rhythmic, in both upper and lower case.

  body: 'The most common Latin word would be <i>ora</i> which means an edge or boundary,
    but which is applied to the coast also. <BR> <BR>Here are a few from dictionaries
    that I am fairly sure of: <BR> <BR>In Indonesian it is <i>pantai.</i> <BR> <BR>In
    Dutch it is <i>kust</i>, while in Afrikaans it is <i>kus.</i> <BR> <BR>My favourite
    may be the Tagalog &#40;Philippines&#41; word <i>pampang.</i> <BR> <BR>I think
    in Swahili it is <i>pwani</i>, but can&#39;t guarantee that.'
