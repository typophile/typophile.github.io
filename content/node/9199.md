body: Hi, I searched through the posts on the forum but couldn&#39;t really find what
  I needed. I&#39;m doing research in my graphic design ethics class for my assignment
  which is to find out what would happen if someone was to use a licensed font on
  a poster without paying, but instead borrowing that font from someone else who bought
  it. I need to find out if that would be breaking any laws, what kind of copyright
  protection is available for the font,  and if you were reported to RCMP by someone,
  what could happen to you and the client you made the poster for? <BR> <BR>Searching
  the internet I haven&#39;t found much info, and most of it is American. I know in
  the States for example that font can only be patented and not copyrighted, though
  font programs can be copyrighted, even though the fonts that you view with it are
  not, which seems to mean that you could get away legally with using a font you don&#39;t
  own? <BR> <BR>Anyways, it would be nice if someone could please point me towards
  some info regarding this, especially how it pertains to Canada.

  body: Any font licensed is only licensed to be used at the address for which it
    was originally licensed. It would be illegal to use the font, even if only borrowing
    it. The only loophole would be if the given foundry from which you licensed the
    typeface has transferability built into their EULA. In that case the person whom
    originally licensed the type would need to contact the foundry and transfer all
    rights of use to the new address and that person would have to remove the typeface
    from their location. <BR> <BR>John, please go the RELEASE area. There are several
    discussions on EULAs &#40;End User License Agreements&#41;.

  body: In the USA, the font software, which is the font file that was &#34;borrowed&#34;
    in your example, is protected by copyright. <BR> <BR>The design may be protected
    by design patent. This protects the abstract shapes. <BR> <BR>The name may be
    protected by trademark. <BR> <BR>I found plenty of interesting links by Googling
    &#34;RCMP copyright enforcement&#34; &#40;without the quotes&#41;. It seems that
    copyright infringement can be a federal criminal offense in Canada. <BR> <BR>Regards,

    border in numbers equal to or greater than the number of US residents who flee
    north for other reasons.

  body: In Canada, a typeface <i>design,</i> as distinct from the copyrighted font
    software, falls under the Industrial Design Act, which provides for a shorter
    period of protection than copyright, and may be considered akin to patent protection
    in the USA. I&#39;m not sure, however, whether the filing requirements are comparable.
