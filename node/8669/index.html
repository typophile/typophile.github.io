It directly translates to &#34;In the wind&#34; which is something I wanted to show in the typography. <BR> <BR>I have a few things in mind that I think need to be fixed: <BR>-I dont think the weight is consitent, I am wondering where I should thicken or thin, I think I should aim for thicker since it will be used as a logo. I think my first letters work better. <BR>-I&#39;m not sure about the thickness of the l to the right, is my t too thin? etc, etc. <BR>-Should I keep a flexible baseline? <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate any input you can give me. <BR>I attached both .jpg and .swf files. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time, <BR>Emilie <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63027.jpg" alt="Dans le vent signature"><!--attachment: danslevent1-63028.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*2.6*Dans+le+vent+signature*danslevent1%2eswf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif" align=left alt="application/x-shockwave-flash">Dans le vent signature<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/danslevent1-63028.swf" target="_blank"><b>danslevent1.swf</b></a> (2.6 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

I think it will help improve legibility at small sizes which is nice. I worked on thinning the letters and getting more uniformity with my thick and thins, baseline and heights.

		<div class="commentbody">The symbol doesn&#39;t really support the text. Is it a yacht &#40;as in the wind would lead me to suppose&#41;? The waves in the first symbol also made me feel the boat was going away from the viewer. As Kemie noted the boat might be improved by painting it with a loose brush and don&#39;t be too scrupulous about cleaning up the digitisation. The heavier text is my preferred option and the changes Scott proposed for the s would help, however I think in the process of cleaning up your sketch you have lost the spontaneity of the original. The a might be better with a loop at the top where it connects to the D and similarly the top of the s and the first n. <BR>Tim</div>

It is a boat but I meant it to be a paper boat &#40;fits better with the name that way&#41;. I tried opening it by doing it with strokes instead of a full mass but was not satisfied, although I should probably give it another shot. <BR> <BR>The identity is for me, I&#39;m a freelance graphic designer. In a way, I&#39;m almost thinking that if I simply scanned my sketch or reworked it with watercolor, it would look much better.
