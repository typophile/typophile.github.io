    buttons to sell fonts. But I  <BR>think their argument is that you don&#39;t need
    clean  <BR>design either. <BR> <BR>Either way, I doubt they lost any users or
    customers. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' The redesign is curious, or maybe just makes me curious. <BR> <BR>two questions
    come to mind...who are these non-designers who actually buy fonts? <BR>And has
    there been any kind of backlash by the type designers selling their fonts at myfonts?
    <BR> <BR>personally, I enjoy the scope of info at the site and can overlook the

    with Joe, its like the Apple web designer just slept with the FisherPrice product
    designer and didn&#39;t use condoms.
