body: can anyone recommend a decent typeface to portray a book about our local river?
  &#40;the Whanganui River, Wanganui, New Zealand,&#41; The book will focus on both
  scientific and artistic issues, so I was thinking of a matching sans &#43; serif
  to represent science &#43; art respectively. At the moment I can only think of Scala
  and Thesis, but I know that there must be some Beautiful &#40;unrelated&#41; sans
  &#43; serifs waiting to be married. Thanks a bunch.

    Seria </a>, from FontShop. I hear that an alternate, more cursive, italic may
    be in the works, so you might ask about that.

    and Italic &#40;8 weights&#41; would seem to be a good choice. Fluid looking for
    display, it&#39;s also excellent for text. Including longish text. <BR> <BR>It
    can be seen at our online interactive typesampler, at <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html"

    course, purchased online here immediately and delivered to you by e-mail today.
    <BR> <BR>Depending on what you&#39;re trying to do with approachability versus
    austerity, my TF Simper might be good for the display material. <BR> <BR>My TF
    Overfield Bold Script might also suit the display matter well. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

    though it&#39;s a seriffed face, the serif is very slight. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>

  body: The wavyness of an irregular font &#40;eg Fontesque&#41; can act as a visual
    metaphor for water - but it has to have a supple line. <BR> <BR>A similar effect
    would be had from an italic with swashes. Chianti is one of the few sans with
    swashes. Or Sauna...

    and this font mix, just to let you know.
