  body: "Another emaciated 19th century font -- this one from a book published in
    London by  Sampson Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington in 1886 https://archive.org/details/cu31924087935973
    -- that is somewhat similar to the Caslon Old Style variant discussed in http://typophile.com/node/118989
    Identifont has selected some digital adaptations which you might consider, starting
    with Monotype Old Style http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Monotype+Old+Style&q=Go
    or Bruce Old Style http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Bruce+Old+Style&q=Go or
    Williams Caslon Text http://www.identifont.com/show?27C9\r\nThese are too heavy,
    but the other digital similar fonts are even heavier.\r\nTrying to match the lowercase
    _g_ with it's small lower bowl might help with the search.\r\nDon\r\n"
