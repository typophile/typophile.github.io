  body: "I can't find the font online, but it used to be in the Image Club Letterpress
    CD's. It's shown in the 'Homage to the Alphabet' book, for those who have it.
    If needed I can post a sample, since I have the Image Club font.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    Mike F. knows where we could still get it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    mentioned I have the font, but all I can offer is to set type you might need.
    You can e-mail me offline if you want to discuss that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
