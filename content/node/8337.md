  body: ' So... the Ten Favourite Fonts list. <BR>As far as fonts go i have two categories:
    1&#41; All time favorites 2&#41; Fonts that inspire but does not nesecarily meet
    up to the criteria in the first category, but nevertheless are important and interessting.
    This second category is less predictable and will perhaps give us a few not so
    well known fonts..and perhaps that will spark a discussion on what we individually
    strive to express in a typeface.  <BR> <BR>The all time favourite fonts will most
    certainly include fonts that we allready know...so I dont think it will produce
    to many surprises to us...So <BR>it would be nice if everyone added a font that

    a list is a great idea, especially if it is such a personal test. It&#39;ll make
    us all feel good. It will, however, not change the world of type-usage out there
    one bit.  I have my own theory about the success of certain faces and it would
    be nice to explore at some point how something as despicable as Avantgarde Gothic
    or something as sickly cute as Optima ever became so popular. But then, your present
    president took his post with less of a quarter of the adult population of this

    together. <BR> <BR>A few years ago, a journalist asked me what I thought were
    the ten most popular typefaces in use today. His question implied that those would

    its scope. <BR> <BR>&#62; we read best what we read most. <BR> <BR>But we also

    There&#39;s no point in pretending to be objective. Just choose your favorites.
    Trouble is, I don&#39;t think anyone here would be particularly interested in
    my top ten as it would probably include such boring fonts as Cheltenham and Plantin
    - and where&#39;s the fun in that?! The 2001 idea is not bad - but not exactly
    easy to be sure of as release dates are never clear after a font is launched.
    Plus there are so many new fonts released in a year, and nobody keeps track of
    them all. Not unless someone wants to start IFDB.com, along the lines of the Internet

    don&#39;t care if the lc &#34;a&#34; has a flawed pedigree - it more than makes
    up for it. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I&#39;m one of those crazies who thinks
    that Cheltenham &#40;the real one, not the ITC caricature&#41; deserved its popularity:
    it has a distinct charm, and a unique readability. I think the fact that it was
    designed by a non-type-designer tends to mar the objectivity of some stodgy -or
    overly conservative, or overly pedantic- type designers &#40;like Tracy, as much
    as I admire him for other things&#41;. And maybe the same negative forces are
