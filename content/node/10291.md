body: I was hoping someone might be able to suggest a dingbat font which showed weight
  training/ work-outs etc. <BR> <BR>I have looked everywhere I can think of, including
  myfonts.com, and T26. This is something I have seen previously and it&#39;s very
  frustrating - any help appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance <BR> <BR>J

  body: Tim, thanks a lot for posting those - they are not quite what I&#39;m looking
    for however, I should have given more detail; <BR> <BR>Basically I have a client
    who teaches physical fitness, and he instructs people on how to do exercises IE;
    lunges, squats, lateral raises with dumbells etc. <BR> <BR>At the moment he gives
    a written description to his clients of their training schedule, but what he could
    do with is some visual diagrams as an aid to memory. <BR> <BR>This is a font I&#39;ve
    seen, and although it&#39;s fairly sketchy - it would meet his needs. <BR> <BR>J

  body: John did you try a free font site like DaFonts? Did you do a Google search?
    Otherwise I think your Illustrator skills will be tested.

    can get a ton of images for really cheap, and sometimes they contain obscure things
    like what you&#39;re looking for. <BR> <BR> - Lex

    it might be time to get the digital camera out. <BR>cheers <BR> <BR>J
