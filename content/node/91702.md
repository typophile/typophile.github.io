  body: Your logo is too black. It will crush any typeface you place near it.

    body: "Sure.\r\nThe concept we made is like one agency that can have all the solutions
      when needs, like the cloud computing we can have any kind of data in anywhere
      anytime, in the concept that represents the knowledge of the agency.\r\n\r\nI

  body: The VE draws immediate attention.  You might try removing the right side serif
    on the V.  (Also, 'cloud' is a very popular name/image these days -- have you
    done a trademark search?)

  body: If you use that one font there, make sure to kern the e closer to the a or
    the A closer to the T. That would be a great start. Also kern the v and the e
    closer together. If you're going to be designing logos you need to learn to be
    aware of letters that are too close or far away from each other based on their
    shapes. When you squint it should look smooth without gaps. If there's a gap,
    try filling it in somehow by altering one of the letters to extend into the gap.
    A logo should be streamlined like an airplane that's been in a wind tunnel for
    some period of time.
