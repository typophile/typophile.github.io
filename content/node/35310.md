  the originals. I'm looking for the name of the originals. If, in fact, they are
  genuine freeware please just state that they are freeware, no need to post the URL.
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helpmeout01_5835.png]\r\nNumber

    thanks to FontPlayer for that ID. Sandy was designed by another Hallmarker named
    Sandy.\r\n01...looks a lot like two Stephenson Blake scripts, Invitation and Palace,
    but isn't quite either."

  body: "#6 is a Hallmark font called SandyTextHmkBold - Coincidentally Rob also worked
    for them. Don't know if he did this.\r\n\r\n(sorry for the edit-got my numbers
    screwed up)\r\n\r\n#1 Artists Script by Dan Solo - many other names for this also.
    Embassy, EnglischeSchT, English Hand WF, Hogarth, Shelly Andante, for starters
    - Nice variation: Viceroy JF\r\n\r\n#4 Champignon - an awfully nice font for the
    author not to take credit for. Comes with a swash version also.\r\n\r\nI guess
    that leaves #2, and maybe a little more detail on #3. I've got nothing in my script
    samples and I don't have the time to go through Mike's Script guide. (Trying to
    get a few photos ready to upload in the morning)"

    it. I think this is a new one, with some resemblances to Champignon (based on
    'Champion' by the late Francoise Boltana), and Monsieur La Doulaise & Miss Fajardose
    (two of Alejandro's 'Bluemlein scripts' at Veer)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
