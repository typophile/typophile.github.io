  body: When I&#39;ve worked with Operina, I found the word spacing to be too wide
    in relation to the letterspacing. How do you find it? <BR> <BR>Watch word pairs
    that need tightening and loosening in relation to the swashy character too. And
    don&#39;t be afraid of the alternate characters, they did a beautiful job of giving
    plenty to play with. For instance, on the second page you could use an alternate
    R in &#34;Resolution&#34; to get the spacing in between R and e to look good.
    <BR> <BR>Fun use of a beautiful face.

  body: IMO, this Garamond is too light, and it doesn&#39;t go well with Operina.
    I&#39;d try something a bit darker &#40;maybe Georgia if you have no budget&#41;.
    <BR>Another thing is to avoid fake small-caps &#40;also avoid italic small-caps&#41;.

  body: The garamond is definately too light. Possibly Pentegraf from Storm Type?
    Although that may be too mannered. I would have to see.

  body: Eduardo, thanks for the pointer on SC italics. I&#39;ll deal with that. <BR>
    <BR>As for a darker text face, I&#39;m looking around for something Venetian-y
    or Garalde that&#39;s a shade darker than that garamond; no such luck yet. Kyle,
    I&#39;m tempted to think that Pentegraf is too mannered; it&#39;s pretty, though.
    I&#39;d like to avoid sinking large quantities of cash into this, since it&#39;s
    a personal project that I don&#39;t expect to produce much in the way of returns.
    &#40;I&#39;d appreciate recommendations, though; it&#39;s always good to expand
    one&#39;s type library.&#41; <BR> <BR>If it helps to clarify my intention, the
    Operina is supposed to be a little jarring; it&#39;s only used for some very infrequent
    technical items. Italics are used for ordinary emphasis. Perhaps it&#39;ll improve
    the layout to tone down the contrast with the text a little, but I don&#39;t want
    to lose the effect entirely. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the pointers, all.
