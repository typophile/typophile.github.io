  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Introduction</strong>
At port tastings we always use placemats, to label glasses, and for the other paperwork that helps run a confusion-free tasting.

Behold the <a href="http://www.jdawiseman.com/port/20111011.pdf">draft placemats for a tasting on 11th October</a>. Observe the background digits, “66” on the second page, currently set in FusiThinNormal, and outlined by my <a href="http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/placemat/placemat.html">PostScript code</a> (with <code>clip</code> … <code>stroke</code>).

<strong>Good features</strong>
• Tall, such that two adjacent digits have a bounding box in the ratio of A4 less 30pt margins. 
• Sans-serif, so not fussy in this background role.
• The neck of the six climbs diagonally, rather than the cluttered look of a vertical then curve.

<strong>Bad features</strong>
• Near the bottom of the inside curve of the 6, a control point is wrong.

<strong>Request</strong>
Can any readers suggest a better tall sans-serif font with good digits?

I am willing to pay a modest fee for a typeface, though obviously prefer free. However, the typeface must be accessible from PostScript, and must be embeddable within PDF.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I'm assuming you realize that the severe squooshing makes the numerals in the draft very uncomfortable - that's at least as bad as the bad node in the "6".

I'm sure people can suggest good fonts* with narrow numerals and the diagonal-style "6" and "9", and I can see that budget is an issue, but to me this is crying out for custom numerals! Something that will make people think "port". Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss pricing for such custom work: hpapazian at gmail dot com

* I might suggest you try Tarzana Narrow.

Also, I have to think that Times-Bold (for the large code in the middle) is sort of pedestrian in this context, especially since you're resorting to the classiness of Greek letters. What would be ideal is to make the font both more expressive and harmonious with the large two-digit background numbers.

Lastly, although I do see the clever circular ring of text all around the placemats, it might be useful to make the central large code also readable from more than one viewpoint; maybe have three (two would be less balanced) copies of the code pointing in 120 degree steps.

• “squooshing”! I admit to using slightly different font sizes for different digits, to make them the same height, but for each digit the x and y sizes are the same. Squoosh-free!

• My limited experience of these matters suggests that there is likely to be great conflict between “budget is an issue” and “custom”.

• I took a screen-shot of a <a href="http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PTarNR.html">web example of Tarzana Narrow Regular</a>, and moved things. A tightly spaced “66” was square. But A4 less my default margins has a ratio about 111:76, far from square. Or are you suggesting that I do some “squooshing”?

• “Times-Bold … is … pedestrian”. Well, yes. But it does have two-and-a-half advantages.
1. It has matching lower-case Greek letters. 
2. It is free. 
2½. I won’t offend any Port drinkers, who are, by nature, conservative creatures.

• There is no need to “make the central large code also readable from more than one viewpoint”. I sit in front of my own glasses. Everybody else sits in front of their own, which are arranged identically. (E.g., <a href="http://www.theportforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=4348&start=8">pictures taken at a recent tasting</a> in which everybody had two 8½″×14″ US Legal pages, and <a href="http://www.theportforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=4978&start=10">another</a> in which everybody had five sheets of A4.)</div>

any squooshing... the font itself is squooshed! :-/  In fact it's a

:-)
The good news is we're talking about only 10 glyphs.

Tarzana-Narrow: you're right, it's not narrow enough. The thing is, most
ultra-narrow fonts don't feature the diagonal-style "6"/"9". What about this?
http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-comp-pro/

Lastly, your rationales for Times and the one-directional code make sense.

In fact, that's a free font, and since it's missing the counters it might actually survive squooshing (and skewing upright). However it's extremely likely to need some tweaks after such brutish treatment.

Perhaps others could suggest possible requirements that I might have forgotten.

• Digits should have level bottoms (on baseline) and tops. But a pointy top, ^, has a lot less visual weight at the top than a horizontal line (e.g., ‘7’) or a smooth curve (e.g., ‘0’ or ‘8’). So no pointy tops please.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">However, this thread has prompted one idea. Some ‘squooshing’ (is that a technical term?) might be acceptable. The code could gain additional parameters specifying a min and max y/x scaling ratio. This would widen the range of appropriate typefaces.

Is there a standard term for squooshiness, and for direction expressed? Perhaps one of y/x, x/y, y/x–1, x/y-1, Ln(y/x), Ln(x/y), where y and x refer to the scaling.</div>

On the other hand poking around can be fun, and educational. Also Julian is flexing his math skills, and just like a muscle the brain does need to keep fit.

Usually the wallet, where else? Not a trifling thing Frode. But often there's also the admirable desire to do it yourself.

Frankly I've noticed you're sometimes overzealous in promoting professional work.

This is less bad than the first one, but the squooshing remains evident, so anybody who notices/minds it in the first one will do so almost as much in the new one. :-/  I'm sure you're mindful of the qualities of the ports you taste; you're the one to decide how much of that mindfulness to port over :-) to the activities peripheral to that particular finer thing in life.

		<div class="commentbody">> Any typographer with a head attached to their body will tell you stretching or squooshing anything* beyond a couple of percent will destroy the original intent of the type designer.

Well, yes. True. If this were more text, five words rather than than two characters, and set at a smaller size, 24pt say, then this squoosh would look foul. But it is only two characters, at several hundred point on A4, outlined faint grey. 

Indeed, the original intent was probably not to be <code>clip</code> … <code>stroke</code>d in faint grey with lots of differently-directioned seriffed black text on top, and glasses of port on that. So put aside the historical (US constitutional) issue of intent, and instead ask whether it looks satisfactory. And I think it does†. Not perfect—absolutely not perfect—but satisfactory for this task, and indeed for this class of tasks.

Indeed, there are improvements more important to me than the squoosh. I would prefer all the characters to have exactly the same heights; and the ‘6’ to have a flat or rounded top; and other changes too. But it is satisfactory as is.



† Obviously it would look a lot lot better with the glasses of port!</div>

Exactly, yes. (Seriously, investigate it!) Those other things though, they are things one would expect any typeface to endure, although -- considering original intent --  some more so than others, 

It's an interesting assumption that squooshing will be less noticable at a larger size, however your example says otherwise.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kerning. When there are only two characters, they can each breathe plenty on three sides. So the fourth can be kerned very tightly. But if typesetting a paragraph of Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet (or the linked example’s cyrillic equivalent), then adjacent characters must be clearly separate but not separated. Different quantity ⇒ different kerning rules. 

Likewise, perception of the relative widths of vertical and horizontal strokes varies with context. Bulk text must be treated as sacrosanct. Headline text is a little more decorative, and a little less prone to exhaustion through quantity, so there is a little more freedom to play. For example, at the larger size and smaller quantity serifs are less useful. And if setting just two characters on a whole page, things are different again. 

Next, read a page of a book. You probably held the book perpendicular to the line of sight. 

With two A4 pages on a dining table, portrait, one ‘above’ the other, the further page is at about 45° from my line of sight, and I’m 6′1½″. For me that is a foreshortening of a factor of about 1.4, and for shorter people the factor will be larger. There is enough wiggle-room  to tolerate the squooshing, even for a type pedant.</div>

It's basically a way to define a font parametrically, with variables that can be changed. Especially since you're clearly very handy with code you should be able to take a suitable metafont sans and generate the width you need by changing the right parameter(s); and then you can export a PS font.

Metafont uses an interesting language, containing elements of PostScript and Mathematica. 

But implementations seem to be a nightmare. What I envisaged was:
• there being somewhere accessible a .mf file specifying a parameterised sans-serif Helvetica-like typeface. 
• there being an application, as user-friendly as compilers/developments applications can be, which can convert .mf files to some widely-used font format. 

Instead:
• I can’t find a parameterised sans-serif Helvetica-like typeface, nor indeed, any others.
• The Metafont application seems to be a pure command-line thing.
• And the only route to PostScript is via a bitmap.</div>

It's very hard making a high-quality font, so it's rare to find a good free one, and extremely rare to find a good free one that fits a tight design brief. Sure, somebody could get lucky, but as others have said there comes a point where the time you spend trying to get lucky isn't cost-effective.
