  weight of a typeface family?\r\n\r\nIf there is a problem caused by an application
  going by the weight number -- and they are both designated as 400 -- rather than
  the weight name, is the solution to give the Book weight a numerical value of 350?\r\n\r\n(The
  problem is that I already have a Light [300] and a Regular [400] weight, and a further
  weight in between is to be added, which would seem to indicate Book as a name.)"

    helpful to your clients--to say your Book is 350. It would give the user the cue
    that it sits between the other two.\r\nI think the word \"Regular\" is the toad
    though. It is looked at by software as the basic style.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    AFAIK, for InDesign \"Regular\" and \"Book\" are two names to describe the same
    thing, so if the family has these two weights you might run into problems as only
    one will be visible.\r\n\r\nI believe the number is used for sorting the weights

    used the Halbfett rather than the Mager before the Buch [book] was available (in
    'Kulturbolschewismus?').\r\n\r\nThe original weights of Futura were Mager [thin],
    Halbfett [semifat], Fett [fat]. These weights and weight names seem to have been
    common in Germany and used in other sanserifs too (Erbar, Elegant Grotesk, Super
    Grotesk).\r\nFutura Buch(schrift) [book] was added inbetween Mager and Halbfett.
    (Similarly, a Normal was added to Erbar.) Maybe it is safe to say that the Buch
    is neither a thinner nor a fatter version of any regular because there <cite>was
    no</cite> such Regular before, rather, the Buch <cite>is</cite> the missing Regular.\r\n\r\n(German)
    weight names then and now differ, and it's not possible to translate them directly.*
    It seems that these new sanserifs required rethinking of weights -- weight names,
    number of weights, relation of weights -- which was not an issue in earlier serif
    types.\r\n\r\n* Interestingly, Syntax's weights are called Mager and Halbfett,
    and a specimen (1968?) translates Mager as Regular, and Halbfett as Bold.\r\n\r\nBut
    this isn't much related to Nick's original question any more ...\r\n\r\n[Yes,
    'Grad' is size.]"

  body: "Pablo: <em>I [...] plan to rename the Regular to Medium [...]</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    sequence of font weights like the following on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font\">Wikipedia</a>
    obviously seem to be influenced by the way some applications list them:\r\n\r\n[...]\r\nLight\r\nBook\r\nNormal
    / regular / roman / plain\r\nMedium\r\nDemi-bold / semi-bold\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I have my doubts about this sequence. The \u2018Book\u2019 weight should come
    <em>after</em> the \u2018Regular\u2019 weight in my opinion, like the \u2018Regular\u2019
    of Monotype\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=664568\">Bembo
    Book</a> is an emboldened version of Monotype\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=165060\">Bembo</a>\u2019s
    \u2018Regular\u2019 weight.\r\n\r\nEspecially when the transition took place from
    (hot) metal to photo composing there was a shift in weight, and this effect was
    even more emphasized by the (sometimes [too] rapid) conversion to digital type.
    Also the fact that single masters were used for the production of text and display
    sizes made matters worse. What is considered to be \u2018Regular\u2019 in our
    time is a gradation lighter than what was used as \u2018Regular\u2019 in the times
    of foundry- and hot-metal type. The \u2018Book\u2019 weight offers the option
    to add a slightly heavier weight for relatively small point sizes, hence its name.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I would never replace the \u2018Regular\u2019 weight by \u2018Medium\u2019 (which
    is in my opinion a synonym for \u2018Semi-bold\u2019, i.e. in between \u2018Regular\u2019
    and \u2018Bold\u2019), and for the DTL Library I use therefore:\r\n\r\n[...]\r\nLight
    (300)\r\nRegular (400)\r\nBook (500)\r\nMedium (600)\r\nBold (700)\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"
