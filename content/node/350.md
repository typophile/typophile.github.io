body: I found a font by the name of Cadiz, and I think it is used on NBC&#39;s &#34;Frazier&#34;.
  I cannot however find who made it and I am wondering if Cadiz is an alias for another
  font. Do you all like this typeface? It seems it could have its uses. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Tom --  <BR> <BR>This is similar to, but not <i>quite</i> the same as, the
    face used for the title of NBC&#39;s <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Frasier/index.html"
    target="_blank"> Frasier</a>. Note that the &#39;R&#39; in your sample has a more
    decorative leg and the &#39;A&#39; exhibits a &#34;backwards&#34; stress. <BR>
    <BR>The Frasier title seems to be based closely on a design called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/florentine/urw-t-regular/testdrive.html?s=CADIZR&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Florentine</a>, first published by ATF in 1896. URW has a digitization
    available. Note that for the Frasier title, the &#39;A&#39; has been normalized,
    instead of the original extended apex.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know of a foundry
    with your Cadiz. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    Thanks!

    <BR> <BR>With a little nip and tuck, this could be used.
