  body: "Interesting. You bring back a memory of one of my first paid projects. Must
    have been 15 years ago. A medical devices company here on Long Island engaged
    me to put together a tri-fold flyer--<i>they</i> referred to it as a brochure
    for some kind of medical lamp they manufactured.\r\n\r\nI recall being very excited
    about the job, despite how they didn\u2019t seem to value it enough to pay me
    anything even remotely realistic. But I was so green, I just wanted something
    for experience. Anyway, they had so me very clear requirements for this project.
    One was that it was to be all-Helvetica: roman, italic, bold, and bold ital were
    all allowed\u2014but that was it. Came out nice enough I guess, considering the
    limitations <i>and</i> my limitations at the time.\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019d use a nice-fitting,
    if unimaginative, serif like Adobe Garamod\u2014something very readable, but not
    glitzy. Never want to distract the reader from learning about the product being
    pitched."
