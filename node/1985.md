body: I&#39;m doing the layout for a book, and since I normally work with newspaperdesign
  I feel like I&#39;m suddenly a bit out of my depth, when it comes to the typography
  for a book. <BR> <BR>I could really use any suggestions or hints when it comes to
  selecting a typeface for the text. <BR> <BR>The book is an historical novel set
  in Germany during the Thirty Years War. Not some textbook on European history, but
  rather an adventure-story that happens to take place in an historical setting &#40;somewhat
  like C.S. Foresters &#34;Hornblower&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked at what
  feels like a million possible fonts, and of those I&#39;ve checked out so far I&#39;m
  leaning towards Adobe Jenson Pro. Maybe.  <BR> <BR>Any other suggestions would be
  much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Bjorn

    those with large x-heights&#41; are wonderful, especially for book work. But:
    <BR>1&#41; You want something that amplifies the topic, and a Jenson seems too
    Italian Renaissance here. <BR>2&#41; What makes a font [nominally] good for a
    book is mostly technical, like proper vertical proportions - and a bunch of fonts
    have what it takes, so the one you choose should have a good reason to be used.
    What&#39;s Jenson&#39;s? <BR> <BR>My first choice would actually be something
    with blackletter overtones, but it&#39;s hard to: <BR>1&#41; Find one subtle enough
    to really work. This is actually something on my back-burner &#40;actually my
    battery of back-burners&#41;. <BR>2&#41; Get publishers to accept such a choice.

  body: Thanks for the help, much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Ehrhardt certainly looks like
    a possibility.  <BR> <BR>I kept thinking in terms of finding a font that fits
    with the dramatic flavor of the book &#40;though how to find a font that says
    &#39;historical action-packed adventure&#39; I don&#39;t know&#41;.  <BR> <BR>To
    instead use a font that fits geographically and chronologically is appealing in
    some way. As I understand it the style of the Ehrhardt font hails from mid-17th
    century Netherlands, yes? That&#39;s practically a perfect fit, so a Kis of some
    kind would be the way to go. <BR> <BR>Is the Ehrhardt particularly superior in
    some way, though? As it happens, my temporary employer already owns Bitstream
    Kis, which, to my eye, look pretty similar to Ehrhardt anyway. &#40;Of course,
    buying a couple of new fonts is no obstacle at all, just wondering.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>As for titling font, I haven&#39;t considered it yet. I figured I&#39;d choose
    text font first and work from there. <BR> <BR>Bjorn

  body: 'I&#39;m actually not a huge stickler for historical accuracy in design. <BR>The
    Kis stuff is indeed from the late 17th century, but mostly it just feels right&#42;,
    a bit old and with that continental elegance - but there could be a recent font
    that&#39;s even better, maybe one of Storm&#39;s more docile designs. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Although some would say that&#39;s only because it&#39;s in fact from the same
    period/geography! For one thing, Kis&#39;s stuff is certainly Dutch-looking &#40;I
    mean the style that Caslon sprung from&#41;, and that&#39;s because he went to
    the Netherlands &#40;from Hungary&#41; to study under the leading Dutch master,
    Voskens &#40;who only agreed to teach him because he knew Kis would be going back
    home at  the end&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; Bitstream Kis <BR> <BR>If you look at the
    stuff on Myfonts&#42; you&#39;ll see that the Bitstream cut is frankly the least
    suitable here...  :-&#40; <BR>It lacks the sharpness and narrowness that I think
    makes Ehrhard promising. Plus there&#39;s only one weight. In fact, considering
    all the extras of Linotype Janson &#40;like old-style numerals&#41;, I might recommend
    that instead &#40;even thought the caps are much tamed compared to Ehrhard&#41;.

    Huh. I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s a whole hell of a lot I have yet to learn regarding
    the subtleties of typography, since I only see minor differences, but I&#39;ll
    take your word for it &#40;being a newspaper layout man I&#39;m used to working
    with a predetermined set of a few fonts and very little room for straying from
    them, hence my inexperience in these matters&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks for

    I can&#39;t &#40;and frankly wouldn&#39;t want to&#41; pretend that my opinions
    represent some sort of benchmark &#40;that would actually be pretty funny&#41;.
    Formally, Bitstream Kis is certainly &#34;mellower&#34; than Ehrhard&#42;, but
    it&#39;s hard to firmly believe which you need more here. My feeling &#40;not
    much more&#41; is that you need something sharp, elegant and a touch archaic.

  body: I currently am trying to figure out the same problem. I have to layout a book
    which is a scientific/environmental study of special rocks/stones found in this
    country. It would be my first book, I&#39;ve been designing only magazines this
    far, so it got me wondering, how much and whether the typeface of the book must
    reflect the topic and by which means it is achievable. I understand that when
    typesetting novels, it&#39;s mostly about the time and style in which they were
    written, but what to do when it comes to science/math/physics etc.? Is there a
    reading on &#34;how to choose the right typeface for a book&#34; topic or the
    only way to understand it is by collecting knowledge scraps from you folks?

    <BR>So a book face can -and should- still amplify the topic, but much more subtley.

  body: I agree with Hrant, don&#39;t let the font style for the book interfer with
    the content. Play with the cover design and maybe the chapter headings and don&#39;t
    let the text even be noticed by the average reader.
