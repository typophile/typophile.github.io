  body: Agree with Akira. I'm also pretty convinced it's an old [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead
    Fonts]] called Kellie Ann, no more available. Unfortunately, I was not able to
    even spot a specimen.

    based on those 5 letters, and managed to find it free.\r\n\r\nThank you"

    To the list that appears there, you can add LHF's Kelly Ann.  It would appear
    that the ICG Basilia is as close to an 'original" as can be found. The others
    (with the possible exception of Kelly Ann) are all by well-known copyists.
