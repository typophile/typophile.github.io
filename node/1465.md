body: What do you consider to be the sexiest letter form or character? Next, what
  do you consider to be the sexiest part of the letter &#40;for one form or characters
  in general&#41;? Finally, what do you consider to be the sexiest type face? <BR>
  <BR> I&#39;m a communication design student at Emily Carr in Vancouver and I&#39;m
  polling this informartion for a project I&#39;m doing on the sensuality and potential
  sexual connontations of type. Any replies will be greatly appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Thank
  you. <BR> <BR>` &#41; <BR>&#40; <BR>` -=====-

  body: ligatures are obvious <BR>X or x is often used in simplified cartoons for
    kisses and the whole XXX thing, then there&#39;s &#34;xoxo&#34; which is pretty
    universal. <BR> <BR>really I think V is purdy sexah. <BR> <BR>but flip-side I
    think D, B, S, 6, anything that looks like it has a beer belly would be unsexy.
    perhaps because I&#39;m female and prefer certain shapes...whereas a male might
    think its a pregnant lady and go &#34;woo&#34;  <BR> <BR>what ever you say though,
    exclamation marks - they just aren&#39;t too subtle...about as sexy as a pick-up
    line.

    seem sexy to me. <BR> <BR>&#62; I think V is purdy sexah <BR> <BR>You should read
    Alfred Kallir. <BR> <BR>&#62; a male might think its a pregnant lady and go &#34;woo&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Hey, we&#39;re not all Beavis and Butthead. <BR>&#34;Hey lady, how did
    THAT happen?&#34;  :-/ <BR> <BR>One of the most unsexy glyphs is the Quadraat

    <BR> <BR>Sexiest part of a letter? Subtle curves, where the leg connects on the
    &#34;R&#34;. Typeface? That&#39;s hard. Caslon, maybe. '

    I think lc &#39;k&#39; is pretty hot. And lc &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; with
    ogonek.  <BR> <BR>Sexiest part...where the bowl joins the stem on lc &#39;n&#39;
    &#40;m, h, u&#41;. There&#39;s just something about crotches ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>And
    no idea what the sexiest face would be. Not Mrs. Eaves ligatures though - those
    are just plain obscene...

  body: O is for orifice.  <BR> <BR>The bowl of the lower case a, especially in grotesques
    like Helvetica, is a breasty shape. <BR> <BR>Modula Ribbed. <BR> <BR>David, statistical
    analysis of pornography is worth considering. You may be able to search online
    using keywords such as &#34;slut&#34; and &#34;comic sans&#34;, although this
    would not capture information about bitmapped typography. <BR> <BR>On a personal
    note, growing up in the heyday of Playboy, I&#39;ve always been partial to a little
    Baskerville.
