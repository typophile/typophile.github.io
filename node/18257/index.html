  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>LETIMES has the latest installment of the Segoe Saga!!!!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited about it that we&rsquo;re posting to Typophile before doing anything else.</p>
<p>Breathtaking new heights have been scaled in design piracy, which will shortly be the subject of new content at letimes.com, which as you know is the site that <em>celebrates</em> type piracy (though it sure doesn&rsquo;t update its website too often).</p>
<p>When Adobe pirated Frutiger in 1993, the designer complained, and Adobe sent Frutiger a letter explaining in seven dense pages, all the <em>true differences</em> there were between Myriad and Frutiger.</p>
<p>But Microsoft&rsquo;s new corporate typeface, Segoe, will cause less trouble. This masterpiece of fidelity is so hard to distinguish from Frutiger that, as we learnt in the EU ruling today, <em>Microsoft now takes the official position that there is no difference between the two designs.</em></p>
<p>See the EU trademark and design authority decision <a href="http://oami.eu.int/PDF/design/invaldec/ICD%20000000743%20decision%20(EN).pdf">here</a>:</p>
<p>The latest news in this saga is that the EU trademark and design registration office has declared Linotype the winner and invalidated Microsoft&rsquo;s registration of Segoe as an original typeface, which just proves our point.</p>
<p>However, though Microsoft may have lost at the EU, we at Le Times congratulate Microsoft for doing an even better job than Adobe in getting to the <em>true essense</em> of Frutiger. Can anything rival the fidelity and sensitivity with which this princely project of piracy has been realised? Can a Peignot award be beckoning for its gifted designers?</p>
<p>Sadly, Le Times must note that Frutiger won&rsquo;t be able to discuss his typeface with Microsoft this time around. Now seventy-five, and ill with lung disease, it seems he doesn&rsquo;t have the strength to concern himself with the matter.</p>
<p>But there is good news too!!!! We expect that Microsoft&rsquo;s shareholders will be grateful to Microsoft for hitting upon this delightful method of saving money. Before commissioning Segoe, Microsoft <em>did</em>, Le Times has heard from Linotype, try to license Frutiger, but baulked at Linotype&rsquo;s price: one penny per OS sold. Kudos to Microsoft for realizing that <em>pennies</em> add up to an <em>unacceptable</em> and <em>unfair</em> shareholder <em>burden</em>.</p>
<p>We expect there will be some <em>carpers</em> out there who fancy it unfair that Frutiger will be deprived of substantial royalties for his work. We can allay their anxiety by advising them to consider the practical, shareholder-driven view: Frutiger will soon no longer be with us.</p>
<p>We ask everyone in the design community to join us in endorsing Microsoft on this felicitous occasion. It takes an entity of Microsoft&rsquo;s <em>philanthropic</em> resources to be able to deliver this final tribute to a great designer on his sickbed.</p>
<p>(Personally, I would have sent flowers instead.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli, thank you so much for this! My God, I had no idea Steve had so totally cloned the italic as well.</p>
<p>And what is Microsoft saying in the pdf you link to? Essentially this: <em>We do not dispute that the designs are identical. We dispute that Linotype sold this data before 2004.</em></p>
<p>What a crock of S-C-H-E-I-S-S-E. We all know that Frutiger Next has been sold by Linotype for several years now.</p>
<p>Sorry, Steve Matteson - I love you but you should have wiped your &mdash;- before you consented to get involved in this really filthy project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to be so crude, but even Goethe was when the occasion demanded, and I think this occasion demands it.</p>
<p>A lot of people need to wipe their &mdash;- here and this is what I suggest to the Microsoft corporate people:</p>
<p>Let MS pay off Frutiger and Linotype.</p>
<p>Let MS in future describe the typeface as a specially designed tribute to the great Adrian Frutiger by his great admirer Steve Matteson.</p>
<p>That is it. End of story. Nobody will ever talk about it again.</p>
<p>And as for you font people at MS, I have this to say. The next time you need a new typeface, whether it&rsquo;s for corporate ID or for something else, do not go to a slippery autodidact, a professional cloner, or a hinting technician. Go to one of the acknowledged masters now in productive late middle age. You have four good choices: Unger, Carter, Berlow, Stone. All four are at the height of their powers, and all four are hungry. These are the designers who can do the work you need done, <em>and do it without disgracing you</em>. And do it cheap. Guys &mdash; have you thought about your futures? Do you really think Microsoft is going to keep on retaining you if you continue to get it into these endless PR, technical, and legal messes? Do you really think you are serving your company well by embarassing it as much as you have in the past two years? And this at the point when Microsoft most needs you to be making superb decisions? When there is so much at stake?</p>
<p>Guys, do you think Microsoft likes being the loser in a legal dispute?</p>

<p>At another thread, the ratio was even worse: Only 1 % downloads of a linked file in comparison with nearly 1000 &ldquo;reads&rdquo; of the thread. Anyone who makes links to one&rsquo;s own files at one&rsquo;s own websites will confirm similar ratios.</p>

Of course, they can&rsquo;t comment, now that their company has shot them in the foot by making it Microsoft&rsquo;s legal position that Frutiger and Segoe are identical. Since Segoe/Frutiger is said to be such a vital part of the Vista UI, it will be interesting to see how this plays out. I don&rsquo;t envy any of the participants their present position. But the moral is, if you don&rsquo;t steal a font, a lot of bad things don&rsquo;t happen to you. What&rsquo;s the old advice &hellip; thou shalt not steal &hellip; something like that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I cannot entirely agree with this without further information, as I am not convinced that in common law argument forgery is anything more than a particular kind, or subset, of theft.</p>
<p>OED defines theft as &lsquo;The action of a thief; the felonious taking away of the personal goods of another; larceny; also, with a and pl., an instance of this. Forgery, by contrast, is &lsquo;3. The making of a thing in fraudulent imitation of something; also, esp. the forging, counterfeiting, or falsifying of a document. For the use in Law see quot. 1769.&rsquo; That quote, from no less than Blackstone is:</p>
<p>1769 Blackstone Comm. IV. 245 Forgery, or the crimen falsi..‘the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man’s right.’</p>
<p>I am certainly willing to accept your position that the proper term to be used here is forgery, but I would want German, British and American legal opinions on that before coming to a firm opinion of my own. Well, and I would also, since I was quoting from the Bible, want to hear a Biblical law opinion as well.</p>
<p>I have a question. You write, in the referenced webpage,</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the same token, &ldquo;Frutiger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Myriad&rdquo; are regarded
as &ldquo;identical&rdquo;. Therefore, Adobe Inc. is not allowed to
register its forgery &ldquo;Myriad&rdquo; as &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;individual&rdquo;
design in the European Community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This implies that Adobe has attempted to register Myriad and that the EU has determined that it is identical to Frutiger. I have not heard of this actually occurring. Has it? If so, could you document it? Or were you stating a hypothetical case? If so, I think it would have been helpful to have stated that.</p>
<p>You point out that Microsoft has a right of appeal, but I suspect that the position enunciated by its own lawyers - that the typefaces are identical - cuts off any possibility for Microsoft to prevail in future actions of any kind with regard to this typeface. Who, by the way, is Graf von so and so? Do you happen to know, Uli?</p>

<p>The judgement states that Linotype&rsquo;s observation that the Segoe and Frutiger are identical is uncontested by Microsoft. That seems to me something less than a positive statement by Microsoft: it may simply mean that they did not elect to answer this observation at all. Could they choose to address it in an appeal? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

In any case, in common law, you can&rsquo;t appeal factual findings, roughly speaking, but only the application of law to those findings &ndash; I think. How this works for the EU I have no idea. There is also only so much we can learn from the rather sparse material on display here. We have not seen any of the briefs, we have not heard any of the arguments. Whatever the case, I have the feeling that MS&rsquo;s statement, or acquiescence in Lino&rsquo;s position, whichever it is, has made the case irretrievable for MS. I can&rsquo;t wait for the next installment! Whatever happens, I get the feeling that this is an important event in the development of practical type law and type ethics. Why it should so have touched a nerve, why it should continue to interest, I have no idea. But it does. It is different from a lot of similar cases in the past, perhaps because of the stature of the typeface, the designer, and the corporations involved; perhaps it is just the world historical mood. Perhaps it is just that there has simply been too much of this. This seems to be the one moment when everyone rose up with one voice to say &lsquo;Enough!&rsquo;</div>

<p>It is okay to speak of &ldquo;theft&rdquo; in the Segoe case, provided this term is used metaphorically. But from the legal point of view, the word &ldquo;theft&rdquo; should be avoided here, because most states of Europa and also most states of America restrict &ldquo;theft&rdquo; to &ldquo;movable property&rdquo;, for example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever intentionally and without claim of right takes, uses, transfers, conceals or retains possession of movable property of another without the other&rsquo;s consent and with intent to deprive the owner permanently of possession of the property&hellip;&rdquo; (definition of theft in Minnesota penal code).</p>
<p>According to the above Minnesota statute definition of &ldquo;theft&rdquo;, one can e.g. steal a CD containing fonts (because CDs are &ldquo;movable&rdquo;), but one cannot e.g. steal the design of a font (because the design is &ldquo;intangible&rdquo;).</p>
<p>2)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This implies that Adobe has attempted to register Myriad and that the EU has</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The forgery Myriad contains the legal declaration &ldquo;U.S. Patent Des. pending&rdquo;, but it is unknown to me, whether Adobe Inc. registered Myriad in Europe. This would be illegal in Europe, since Myriad is a forgery of Frutiger. Registering a forgery of Frutiger in Europe constitutes the crime of fraud, if the sale of the forgery takes place. In the Segoe case, the crime of fraud did not yet take place, since the sale of this Frutiger forgery (or rather the sale of Windows Vista containing the forgery) does not yet take place in Europe.</p>
<p>Note: The invalidity division stated that &ldquo;the prior design and the RCD are to be considered identical&rdquo;. The prior design is the original, and the RCD is the forgery. In the Myriad case, the invalidity division would certainly arrive at the same conclusion as in the Segoe case.</p>
<p>3)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who, by the way, is Graf von so and so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bosch, Graf von Stosch, Jehle&rdquo; (note the commas) are the names of lawyers of a law firm in the city of Munich in Germany representing the Microsoft Corporation in patent law matters.</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.bgsj.de">http://www.bgsj.de</a></p>
<p>4)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The judgement states that Linotype’s observation that the Segoe and Frutiger are
identical is uncontested by Microsoft. That seems to me something less than a
positive statement by Microsoft: it may simply mean that they did not elect to
answer this observation at all. Could they choose to address it in an appeal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be emphasized that the invalidity decision is not a &ldquo;judgement&rdquo; by a law court, but a decision by a non-judiciary administative office. For those who want to know to what extent the design of fonts may be protected in Europe, I uploaded the full text of the &ldquo;Council Regulation No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs&rdquo; as document Segoe4.pdf to my website</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/index.htm#Monotype">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/index.htm#Monotype</a></p>
<p>Microsoft of course is permitted to appeal (see the invalidity decision shown in file Segoe1.pdf and see also page 23 of file Segoe4.pdf). But what is more important, should Microsoft not win this appeal, it can institute legal proceedings at a real law court (see page 24 of file Segoe4.pdf). This means that the invalidity decision of the administrative invalidity division is not yet final, although the invalidity decision would become final, if Microsoft did not lodge an appeal.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite all these various legal remedies available to Microsoft, in my view it is practically impossible that Microsoft will win for two reasons:</p>
<p>a) From the procedural point of view, the fact that Microsoft did not contest (&ldquo;As rightfully observed by the Applicant and uncontested by the Holder, the prior design and the RCD are to be considered identical.&quot;) has the procedural consequence that any later contestation will not be accepted by a law court on account of the legal principle called &ldquo;venire contra factum proprium&rdquo;. Therefore to assume &ldquo;it may simply mean that they did not elect to answer this observation at all&rdquo; would mean, at least by European procedural law, that the Microsoft lawyers Bosch, Graf von Stosch, Jehle made an unpardonable procedural mistake which is difficult or even impossible to remedy later by another law firm.</p>
<p>b) However, even if Microsoft&rsquo;s belated contestation would be accepted by a law court, such a contestation is useless, because Microsoft cannot to prove that Segoe is <em>not</em> identical with Frutiger (&ldquo;identical&rdquo; in the sense used by the invalidity division). Therefore, in my view, the Microsoft lawyers Bosch, Graf von Stosch, Jehle did not make a procedural mistake, but instead came to the conclusion that would be futile to contest that Segoe is not a forgery of Frutiger.</p>
<p>5)</p>
<p>The real trouble will start for Microsoft, as so as Microsoft starts selling Windows Vista including the forgery Segoe to customers in Europe. In strict legal parlance, Microsoft does not &ldquo;sell&rdquo; Windows in the same way a baker sells pancakes, but Microsoft &ldquo;grants licences&rdquo; via EULA contracts, i.e. it &ldquo;sells&rdquo; rights. But Microsoft does not own the rights to Segoe, since nobody can legally own the rights to any forgery of Frutiger. And since it constitutes the crime of fraud, if someone &ldquo;sells&rdquo; rights which do not exist, any European customer can request that the monopolist Microsoft sells Windows Vista without the forgery Segoe. And this means that Microsoft will have to offer two versions of Windows Vista: One version including the Frutiger forgery Segoe designed for Americans and one version without the Frutiger forgery Segoe designed for Europeans.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you, Uli, for clarifying these matters quite satisfactorily. I am interested in the detail you give as to the possible action against Microsoft for fraud that would appear to lie open to Linotype were Segoe to be sold or licensed in the EU. I had assumed that Linotype would have such an action open to them, since it is incontestable that Microsoft knew in enormous detail about the existence of Frutiger before they decided to forge it, to use the terminology you suggest: (a) MS had already licensed Frutiger for eBooks, not something Microsoft likes to do but in this case it evidently realised the induplicable benefits that would accrue from using Frutiger in eBooks and (b) Microsoft later attempted to license Frutiger Next for Vista, but refused to accept Linotype&rsquo;s terms of a penny (US) per OS unit sold/licensed.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t that action technically lie open now, as a consequence of Segoe&rsquo;s exceptionally wide distribution to graphic designers and beta testers? We have to consider that Segoe is not only said by Microsoft to be an essential part of the UI in Vista. It has also been stated to be Microsoft&rsquo;s new corporate identity typeface and has been distributed as such.</p>
<p>What I cannot quite understand is why Microsoft caused so many statements to be published online and elsewhere concerning the &lsquo;originality&rsquo; of Segoe. This apparently was done in the full knowledge that these statements were not true.</p>
<p>This raises the question why such publication was made and when. Some of these publications appeared to be spontaneous &lsquo;comments&rsquo; on blogs such as this one. It would now appear that such apparently spontaneous comments were in reality part of a carefully orchestrated propoganda campaign. I hate to use that politically charged word propoganda, but what else is there? From a practical standpoint, one would also be interested to learn how the parties to the forgery agreed to indemnify themselves.</p>
<p>Sadly, now that the issue has come to litigation, I expect it will be some time before we see any Microsoft employee publishing or posting any (dis)information about Segoe, for obvious legal reasons. Maybe I&rsquo;m misreading the situation? In that case  . . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It should be noted, for the sake of clarity, that Segoe UI was commissioned from Monotype by the Microsoft Typography group, while the ClearType Collection fonts were commissioned, from various designers, by the Advanced Reading Technologies group (who were also responsible for the eBook software and the earlier licensing of Frutiger). These two groups at Microsoft operate independently, with entirely separate budgets and mandates. If there are feathers to be tarred, watch where you are flinging the brush about.</p>
<p>Of course, what corporate lawyers decide is the best strategy to pursue in a patent challenge doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect the personal views of people in either the MS Typography or ART groups.</p>
<p>The only thing to add is that I that I think Jeremy Tankard&rsquo;s Corbel, from the CT collection, would make a very nice UI and corporate identity font :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you John for (I would judge) going out on a bit of a limb to make this point clear: the Segoe story has nothing (as far as I know or can imagine) to do with the ClearType story. It is important not to get the points confused. If Nick can get the two issues confused, anyone can get them confused, and they should not be confused. The fault may be mine, perhaps for having been unable to resist a cautious if slightly Menckenian dig (which I hope will have a brought a reluctant smile) at the CT project that I thought was so vague it would sail over everyone&rsquo;s head. My touch is clumsier than I thought and the remark should not have been made.</p>
<p>Nick, you raise some good points which I would like to address. You suggest that the old guys may have been invited to participate in the CT project but declined on political grounds. That is not the case, I happen to know. None of them was asked. Clearly, there was a desire to bring some new and younger faces on the scene. That is inherently laudable, extremely so. In this case, there were overriding practical reasons why it should not have been done, or not have been done to quite the extent it was done, but that has all been gone into on this forum and presumably forgotten. I wish it were quite off topic but it isn&rsquo;t. To continue with your train of speculation, since the &lsquo;Four Kings&rsquo; weren&rsquo;t asked, we can&rsquo;t know how they would have responded. But I think I can safely guess that they would have accepted, and for two reasons. The first is that almost no type designer can afford to turn down a commission, and to go further, there is scarcely, I think, any artist or craftsman who is not eager to make the Faustian compact, if only he is given the chance.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the designer/artist/craftsman who is dealing with the devil always thinks he can do something to correct the devil&rsquo;s ill deeds. The latter of these factors operated for Zapf when he consented to design Linotype Palatino for Microsoft. I don&rsquo;t think he needs the money, but I do know that he ardently hoped, and was led to believe, that &lsquo;Book Antiqua&rsquo; - as great an affront to him as Segoe is to Frutiger - would disappear from the Microsoft OS. And it did. But not from Microsoft apps. Apparently, Book Antiqua is too entrenched to enjoy the death that Zapf was led to expect would befall it when he consented to build Linotype Palatino for Microsoft. I believe that the deed could have been done with some sort of substitution tables and perhaps some explanatory information, but Microsoft, undoubtedly for what it saw as overwhelming practical reasons, chose not to go that way. At least as I understand what transpired. Furthermore, though Book Antiqua was designed to have metrics identical to Postscript 35 Palatino, what if the new Linotype Palatino metrics were not identical? And wouldn&rsquo;t that have been an unfair burden to place on the designer?</p>
<p>&lsquo;So if push came to shove, and MS offered to pay you big bicks for a commission, would you accept?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I would like to say &lsquo;indubitably yes&rsquo;, but I am so unaccountable, there&rsquo;s no telling what I would do. And I very much doubt I will ever have the opportunity to find out.</p>
<p>What I would like to say is that your remarks connect with something that has been going on in my head over the last few days, and that is that I constantly find myself looking for an easy way to solve some type problem and get something out there that is good and doesn&rsquo;t take much effort. And I am constantly finding that every time I try to do this, it doesn&rsquo;t work. But I can&rsquo;t stop myself from looking for an easy way out. You would think, after all this time, I would have learnt my lesson. And I am just thinking in the realm of pretty ordinary text type. I can imagine that a charming, daffy, and quite original display typeface like your Fontesque might have sprung out pretty quickly and effortlessly. On the other hand, it would not surprise me if a lot of long and grueling work went into it. Which way was it for you, Nick?</p>
<p>Finally, and getting further off topic, John, I would not be surprised if Corbel would make a great UI and corporate font, but you really ought to make an effort to show it better than you have done in the past! Speaking of which, we are very busy here defending the Frutiger typeface, as it is right for us to do. But I quite agree that almost anything else would have been a better choice for Microsoft. Especially given Apple&rsquo;s extensive use of Myriad. Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how  exceptionally staid and rigid technology companies are in their corporate ID schemata? I sometimes find myself thinking that I would be happy never to see Frutiger again. It needs a rest. Yet on the other hand, it <em>has</em> had a rest. Here we are seeing its second period of triumph. And maybe the reason both Apple and Microsoft are using Frutiger so extensively is that the matter is, somehow, not really in their control? That Frutiger is, somehow, the typographic language such a company <em>has</em> to speak at this point in time? The more I learn about Frutiger, the more powerful it seems.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the ethical issue does not change. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like Frutiger or dislike Frutiger. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you want to use it, or don&rsquo;t want to use it, or are compelled by inscrutable forces to use just this Weltbild/design against your will: if you do actually use Frutiger, you must pay Linotype, its owner, for it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As already stated by me, the real trouble does not start now, but will start in the near future, e.g. by the end of 2006 or later, when Windows Vista is sold by Microsoft in Europe. There are three different legal scenarios, namely these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Segoe as ordinary fraud crime</li>
</ol>
<p>This legal scenario cannot be specified presently, because it is not yet known, whether e.g. Ascender will sell the Frutiger forgery Segoe in the near or far future.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Segoe as &ldquo;branding&rdquo; case</li>
</ol>
<p>This legal situation already exists today, because Microsoft and its advertising and promotion agencies already today use Segoe as &ldquo;branding&rdquo; font for typesetting of Microsoft advertisements etc. See the publicity PDF files at the <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com">www.Microsoft.com</a> website.</p>
<p>In the Segoe &ldquo;branding&rdquo; case, the legal situation is completely identical to the legal situation in the United Parcel Service case (UPS Sans vs. FF Dax alias Barmen). This latter case has already been described by me in a 16-page German-language document:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/barmen.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/barmen.pdf</a></p>
<p>Whatever was said in this document concerning the UPS Sans &ldquo;branding&rdquo; case also applies to the Segoe &ldquo;branding&rdquo; case so that there is no need to repeat here what was said there.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Segoe as EC anti-trust case</li>
</ol>
<p>The legal scenario for this case cannot be specified presently, because everything depends on whether or not Microsoft will include Segoe into the Windows Vista version distributed in future in the European Community.</p>
<p>Microsoft as a monopolist has repeatedly ignored the European anti-trust laws, notably in the &ldquo;500 million Euro fine&rdquo; case two years ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1149791,00.html">http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1149791,00.html</a></p>
<p>For the current EU vs. Microsoft situation see the official website here</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurunion.org/News/press/2006/20060016.htm">http://www.eurunion.org/News/press/2006/20060016.htm</a></p>
<p>From this official website, it becomes apparent that the European Anti-Trust Commission does not accept the illegal &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; behaviour of Microsoft concerning the Windows operating system components.</p>
<p>Let us assume, Microsoft will sell Windows Vista &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; the Frutiger forgery Segoe in Europe, then it is likely that the monopolist Microsoft will be forced by the European Commission to &ldquo;unbundle&rdquo; Windows Vista, i.e. to sell it without this forgery, because nobody in Europe can be expected to accept forged fonts as part of an operating system, in the same way as nobody can be expected to accept forged bank notes as part of the monthly salary.</p>

<p>The way I heard it, Hermann Zapf quit ATypI because of Book Antiqua, the MS face that looks like Palatino. Adrian Frutiger was miffed at Adobe for Myriad&rsquo;s resemblance to his eponymous face. There&rsquo;s two type designers that would likely decline an invitation to work for MS, don&rsquo;t you think?

<p>My business has never been better, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to expanding into the CE, Greek and Cyrillic font market &ndash; which is something that MS is opening up. So why would I think MS is hurting my business?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>from David</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Segoe named after Tom Rickner’s street?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, that is a myth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John, sight unseen, but market well know, no one in thier right corporate mind would choose a MS CT font for a Corp logo or ID, Should They?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is what you&rsquo;re really saying here that a typeface is always tarred with its intention? I&rsquo;m expressing it badly, but I get the feeling you&rsquo;re trying to make an important point about the depth of study that should (must) go into a successful corporate ID process.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bill, I’m not at all hungry for anymore monolithic 1-style-fits-all UI faces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>OK. After - how many is it now? literally half a million glyphs? after so many, you&rsquo;re entitled to say, Enough! You earned the right. But would you also decline the opportunity to design a corporate ID for MS? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be an interesting enough challenge? On the other hand, it would be a very muddy issue if the brief were to devise both a corporate ID and a UI. That seems to me insane, something only either a clueless executive could dream up - - or is it in reality a brilliant requirement?</p>
<p>&lsquo;This whole issue seems to be a good example of the old saying that “all corruption empowers.”&rsquo;</p>
<p>I blush to say I never heard that one, but I really like it.</p>
<p>By the way, to set the record straight. Segoe is named after Bill Davis&rsquo;s great-great-grandmother, Amalie von und zu Segoe, who was the cousin of Gräfin Sophie zu [but not von] Segoe, familiar to type historians for her role in preserving the Auerbach matrices in the cellar of her manse during the Franco-Prussian war. This information is well known to <em>anyone</em> who has perused the pages of the Almanach de Thypa of 1894. There is a copy at Yale.</p>
<p>Back to the topic, I really like the way Nick is trying to express, through the static, the fundamental point that type is intellectual property to be respected. When put this way, it seems so utterly shocking that it&rsquo;s the American habit not to respect it. I like too Uli&rsquo;s expression of the old world attitude: &lsquo;nobody in Europe can be expected to accept forged fonts as part of an operating system, in the same way as nobody can be expected to accept forged bank notes as part of the monthly salary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When you think about it, there is nothing more painful than for a type designer to be told, after years of work on something - - &lsquo;this is not yours, it is mine&rsquo;. It is an issue that must be addressed. And I think we are, slowly, seeing it be addressed. The attention Matthew Carter got in the New Yorker is one example. The attention that Segoe is getting is another. Something is shifting in the wind.</p>

<p><em>Which way was it for you, Nick?</em></p>
<p>The original Fontesque sketches were done in a couple of minutes, but it was a lot of manual work scanning and tracing, then giving the fonts typographic colour. My first foray in Fontographer, learning the software at the same time. And it has a proper italic, &ndash; I recall days spent trying to draw the italic &ldquo;g&rdquo; before ending up basing it on transformations of the roman g. That was 1993, a lot of type designers' first digital fonts were &ldquo;informal&rdquo;. A few years later, techno, that was way less work.</p>

<p>By &lsquo;Four Kings&rsquo; I presume you mean the quadrumvirate you referred to above: Unger, Carter, Berlow, Stone. Don&rsquo;t forget that Matthew was very much involved in the CT project, designing the western companion forms to the Meiryo typeface. This is an impressive example of the importance of quite subtle changes to an existing design (Verdana) in harmonising with another script, and bears study, as I found when I prepared some comparison visuals for Margaret Re to use in her retrospective lecture on Matthew&rsquo;s work at the ATypI conference last year.</p>

<p>Not in its CT-optimised form, perhaps, but I was thinking in terms of adjustment of the design to appropriate weight and proportion. But this relates to the already odd situation of Segoe doing double-duty as a UI and corporate ID face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Corbel as a UI font for over a year, and despite not being designed specifically for that purpose it performs very well. It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to optimise the design for such a purpose, and I doubt if there would be much to recommend Segoe UI over it.</p>
<p>Would Corbel do as well as Segoe as a corporate branding font (and bearing in mind that this is the whole of the question, not whether Segoe is a good choice itself)? It at least has the benefit of not being a Frutiger clone, and being well outside the similar genre employed by Apple.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant has drawn to my attention that the following paragraph may convey a message very different from what I meant:</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you think about it, there is nothing more painful than for a type designer to be told, after years of work on something - - ‘this is not yours, it is mine’. It is an issue that must be addressed. And I think we are, slowly, seeing it be addressed. The attention Matthew Carter got in the New Yorker is one example. The attention that Segoe is getting is another. Something is shifting in the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What I meant is that one of the good things that is happening today is the positive attention that MC got in the New Yorker profile. Equally valuable, I think, is the negative attention that the Segoe forgery (to use Uli&rsquo;s uncomfortable but apparently absolutely accurate terminology) is getting. Both increase the public&rsquo;s awareness that type is valuable intellectual property which a few people really do try to make a living from. It is not something that magically appears from nothing, as a gift from history. Probably the type industry has been guilty of an enormous amount of negligence in failing to educate the public about the difficulties of making digital type today, about the enormous strides that have been made, and more importantly, about the enormous strides the <em>remain</em> to be made. It&rsquo;s elementary marketing psychology: once you give people the feeling they ought to have something they don&rsquo;t have or that doesn&rsquo;t yet exist but may in the future, they want it. You&rsquo;re educating them into an expectation. From this point of view - basic customer education - the marketing of type in the US over the past twenty years has been unbearably inept.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hrant feels that I was implying that there was something negative in MC&rsquo;s profile. Of course there isn&rsquo;t and I don&rsquo;t want anyone to think I was hinting at that. I think we are all unreservedly thrilled that Carter is getting this well-deserved attention.</p>
<p>John, of course I knew quite well that the redesign of the Meiryo variant of Verdana was part of CT2 but I didn&rsquo;t count it as it was after all just a redesign of perhaps the most well-known constituent of CT1. However, you are right to remind people of this for the record. I think we would all be interested to hear more from you on the differences you speak of and would be grateful to have you post something about it, if you have the energy to start a new thread.</p>
<p>I have one more off-topic question for Nick. OK. Fontesque was an easy birth and a slightly more difficult upbringing, but not too bad. But you were already a fairly experienced graphic artist at that point, weren&rsquo;t you? My last question then, would be, to what extent did years of previous training and work make it possible for it all to come out relatively fluently? Or was it just a kind of effortless gift?</p>
<p>Oh and finally, John, I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s very rigorous to argue that Corbel would suit MS as a corporate ID font on the grounds that at the very least, it isn&rsquo;t a Frutiger clone. I would have thought that a corporate ID font should be designed or chosen with a really thoughtful insight into what a company is and what it wants to convey. But then, in a perverse way, Segoe does penetrate to the historical soul of MS, doesn&rsquo;t it? Didn&rsquo;t Microsoft start out roughly as follows? IBM needed an OS for the 8088-based PC. So MS bought Seattle Computer&rsquo;s clone of Digital Research&rsquo;s CP/M (the standard for 8080-based pre-IBM PCs) for $25,000. Of course, as is well known, the only reason DR lost out to MS was that DR&rsquo;s founder kept IBM&rsquo;s executives waiting for so many hours they were literally forced into MS&rsquo;s arms . . . . Anyway, buying a clone is nothing new for MS. On the other hand, perhaps buying a forgery is? It will be interesting to see how this all pans out.</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to have some real difficulty dealing with the EU. Indeed, MS&rsquo;s difficulty in grasping the EU rather reminds me of IBM&rsquo;s difficulty in grasping Microsoft. IBM simply didn&rsquo;t have a clue, and one really must give MS credit for screwing those clueless suits again and again and again. Now, with the EU, you get the feeling that it&rsquo;s MS which has turned into the clueless suits. Uli keeps on harping on MS&rsquo;s status as a monopolist. And that of course is what IBM was so often accused of before Microsoft defanged it. Let us please remember that Microsoft deserves the credit for this historic deed!</p>
<p>Of course it is unhealthy and ultimately deadly to progress for any company to enjoy a monopoly. But there is also a simple reality here: most of the world does not want to live with 30 different OSs, 3000 incompatible productivity apps with incompatible formats, and more incompatible documents than anyone could count this little world over.</p>
<p>Apologies for this overlong rant. I must really not want to work on my font this week.</p>

<p>I was originally a fine artist, though more of a print-maker than a painter. I&rsquo;m self-taught as a typographer (no training), although I did take a course in calligraphy. I worked as an art director from 1977, doing marker comps of headline type for hours every day until the Mac obviated that (for me) in 1988, so type drawing fluency was well practised. Also by the time I did Fontesque, I had been using Illustrator for 5 years, so I was familiar with BCPs. Having said that, I think a lot of type designers have a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; casual script typeface within themself &ndash; I was fortunate that mine came out in 1994.</p>

<p>I was making the comment in the context of MS already using the same typeface for a UI font and a corporate marketing font. My point was that Corbel, with appropriate tweaking, could perform either role as well as or better than Segoe performs them. This is why I said that was the whole of the question in terms of comparing the two faces. Obviously there is another question about the appropriateness of either as a corporate branding type for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have limited my initial comment to the worthiness of Corbel as a UI font, which is actually the more interesting case. As I say, I&rsquo;ve been using it as a UI font for many months, and think it works very well (mind you, my screen has a higher than average resolution).</p>

<p>In case that creation year &ldquo;1997&rdquo; is not a fake, then Monotype at first made a forgery of the old Frutiger, and later, after publication of Frutiger Next, either Monotype or Microsoft made again a font forgery, but now of the new Frutiger.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli, creation dates are notoriously unreliable indicators. They vary in accuracy depending on both the tool used and the attention of the manufacturer. And what is the creation date? The date on which the font source file was first created? The date on which the first shipping version was produced? People interpret it differently, and some people pretty much ignore it. The existence of fonts with older creation dates does not indicate much at all. I&rsquo;ve seen fonts made last year that claim to have been made in 1969, because they were made with a tool that had a default setting for 1969 that needed to be changed by the font developer.</p>
<p>However, in reference to the pre-Microsoft history of Segoe, <a fef="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/11/28/497441.aspx">this comment</a> from Si Daniels at MST is worth rereading:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;The original Segoe fonts were not created for or by Microsoft. It was an existing Monotype design which we licensed and extensively extended and customized to meet the requirements of different processes, apps and devices.'</em></p>
<p>By the wyay, forgery seems an inappropriate term to this English speaker, because it usually implies something fake passed off as something real, i.e. something not Frutiger passed off as Frutiger. In this case, we have something like Frutiger claimed as not Frutiger. If an intentional copy, it would be an example of plagiarism not forgery.</p>

Segoe is named after Bill Davis’s great-great-grandmother, Amalie von und zu Segoe, who was the cousin of Gräfin Sophie zu [but not von] Segoe, familiar to type historians for her role in preserving the Auerbach matrices in the cellar of her manse during the Franco-Prussian war. This information is well known to anyone who has perused the pages of the Almanach de Thypa of 1894. There is a copy at Yale.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious, Bill. I think you should write a history of German typography in this manner.</p>
<p>Segoe is actually named, indirectly, for Ladislas Segoe (1894-1983), an important figure in mid-century American urban planning who largely defined the role of urban planner as it is practised today (see. &lsquo;Ladislas Segoe and the Emergence of the Professional Planning Consultant&rsquo; in the <em>Journal Of Planning History</em>, 2003, VOL 2; PART 1, pages 47-78). He is primarily associated with the city of Cincinatti, but also contributed to the planning of Madison Wisconsin, where there is indeed a road named after him on which Tom Rickner may or may not live.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your explanations.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;forgery&rdquo; as it is use by me is a legal term in (German) law books defined as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;forgery&rdquo; = &ldquo;a copy made in order to deceive&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>As a first step, a copy (or imitation or replica or clone) is made.</li>
<li>As a second step, an act of deception (or of fraud) takes place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your description &ldquo;we have something like Frutiger claimed as not Frutiger&rdquo; exactly fits my definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;something like Frutiger&rdquo; is the &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of Frutiger.</li>
<li>&ldquo;claimed as not Frutiger&rdquo; is the &ldquo;deception&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I perused the German book &ldquo;Schriftstatistik&rdquo; (Typeface Statistics) by Peter Karow published in Hamburg in 1992. On page 25 of his book, Peter Karow publicly declared that he made a copy (or clone or reproduction) of the font &ldquo;Frutiger&rdquo; and labeled it &ldquo;Frutus&rdquo;. Thereafter I looked up the 1000-page manual to Peter Karow&rsquo;s &ldquo;TypeWorks&rdquo; collection, wherein he publicly declared in the preface that his copy or his clone &ldquo;Frutus&rdquo; is the font &ldquo;Frutiger&rdquo;. Therefore no deception took place, because here we do not have &ldquo;something like Frutiger claimed as not Frutiger&rdquo;, but on the contrary Peter Karow claimed that &ldquo;Frutus&rdquo; is &ldquo;Frutiger&rdquo;, i.e. a copy or clone of &ldquo;Frutiger&rdquo;. Therefore, &ldquo;Frutus&rdquo; is not a forgery, because Karow did not deceive anybody concerning his copy or clone &ldquo;Frutus&rdquo;. We may describe Peter Karow as a &ldquo;copyist&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;cloner&rdquo;, but not as a &ldquo;forger&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now let us compare Peter Karow to the forgers at Monotype and Microsoft. Did Steve Matteson at Monotype or Simon Daniels at Microsoft publicly and frankly declare that &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; is a copy or a clone of &ldquo;Frutiger&rdquo;? No, they did not. On the contrary, they deceived Windows users concerning Segoe. For instance, the font forger Steve Matteson declares at his website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/portfolio_custom.html">http://www.ascendercorp.com/portfolio_custom.html</a></p>
<p>the following: &ldquo;Segoe is Microsoft&rsquo;s new branding typeface&hellip; Steve Matteson started this project&hellip;&rdquo;. No mention of Frutiger, see? That is why &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; is a forgery.</p>

<p>But you are translating this German legal definition into English and using the term in an English-language discussion in an English-language forum, and I think in this context the normal English usage of the term has to be acknowledged. Art or literary forgery provides the typical model: a copy (or work in a recognisable style) passed off as an original of the copied artist. Copying something and passing it off as your own invention is not usually called forgery: it is called plagiarism.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you John for your remarks on the Almanach. I wonder if Uli caught the rather cheesy reference to Faust? Albert de Frayne, a Monegasque chess player of great talent and undeserved obscurity who lurks here but sometimes corresponds with me privately, was completely deceived.</p>
<p>Now to our vocabulary:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Copying something and passing it off as your own invention is not usually called forgery: it is called plagiarism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which of course is not often considered an indictable offense, though it is frightfully bad manners. Good try, John! (In England, Uli, plagiarists are sometimes sent to Coventry, and if you know that expression, now verging on the archaic, your English is superb. I imagine most reasonably well-educated Americans are unfamiliar with it.)</p>
<p>However, John, I think you are spinning the English definition too far away from OED: <em>The making of a thing in fraudulent imitation of something; also, esp. the forging, counterfeiting, or falsifying of a document.</em></p>
<p>The making of a thing in fraudulent imitation of something - that seems just about to fit the case of Segoe, and it is the primary sense of the word; the sense you and I use most comfortably is secondary though not secondary enough to be considered distinct. I admit that I too was uncomfortable with &lsquo;forgery&rsquo; at first. But I now accept that was only because I didn&rsquo;t know what the word meant. It&rsquo;s very trying for a competent English writer to be corrected on a simple word usage by a German, but one sometimes has to submit to these indignities with as much grace as one can summon.</p>
<p>Yes, we all mostly know a popular, common sense of the word, which we often apply to paintings and documents. But that is not the exclusive sense. The larger sense in OED seems to fit this crime perfectly, and I can&rsquo;t think of a better term in English.</p>
<p>&lsquo;fraudulent imitation&rsquo; is the key basic sense we have to grasp here.</p>
<p>What does fraud mean? Again, in OED, the key sense is &lsquo;Criminal deception; the using of false representations to obtain an unjust advantage or to injure the rights or interests of another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is absolutely on target here. Microsoft falsely represented to the EU that Segoe was an original typeface. It was indisputably their intention to injure the rights and interests of Linotype and Frutiger by doing so. I can&rsquo;t see any way round that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Imitate&rsquo; is too richly defined to quote here, but some key extracts are, &lsquo;to mimic, counterfeit&rsquo;, &lsquo;to copy, reproduce&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So: I accept &lsquo;fraudulent imitation&rsquo; as an exact description of Segoe.</p>
<p>In that case, why not accept &lsquo;forgery&rsquo; since that is exactly what &lsquo;fraudulent imitation&rsquo; means?</p>
<p>That fraud was intended, and achieved here, cannot I think be gainsaid, can it?</p>
<p>Over the weekend I&rsquo;m going to try and run the whole question by a couple of senior American federal judges I know; it will be interesting to see if they can provide any additional illumination. That&rsquo;s always supposing I can get them to understand what a digital typeface actually is. They are both getting on in years. But one is a real expert in derivative artworks, so his opinion should be worth having if he will give it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, thanks for your further comments about Fontesque, which I think is one of the finest of all fantasy fonts, as one might call them. What you say confirms my feeling that it had to have come out of some substantial backlog of skill and experience. I apparently fibbed, by the way, when I said somewhere that I had written about it in the mid-90s. I looked through all my files and saw that though it was illustrated and captioned in a story I did on FontFonts for Publish or DTPJournal, or something like that, there wasn&rsquo;t enough room to actually say anything about it. Of course the story could have been changed at some point, and I don&rsquo;t have a print copy anymore. Oh let me stop blathering, nothing I wrote about fonts in the mid-90s is worth the bandwidth even at today&rsquo;s prices.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>In that case, why not accept ‘forgery’ since that is exactly what ‘fraudulent imitation’ means?</em></p>
<p>Again, the usual model of fraudulent imitation in a case of forgery is the passing off of the imitation as the original that it imitates, and that is what most people will think of when they hear the word forgery. In this case, the apparent imitation is being passed off as <em>not</em> the original that it imitates, for which we have the very serviceable term plagiarism. Plagiarism is not in itself an indictable offence, as you note, but individual cases of plagiarism may certainly constitute fraud.</p>
<p>Both Linotype and Microsoft are my clients, so I&rsquo;m not inspired to get into a discussion about intentions. Sorry. I have been frank all along, though, to anyone who cared to ask, that I believe Segoe to be too close to Frutiger. Even cutting Monotype the maximum slack and imagining that they could have produced this design without deliberately referencing Frutiger and Frutiger Next, the result is unacceptably close. Stupidly so, in fact, and I&rsquo;m amazed anyone thought it was a good idea to license it. Even with the best of intentions to produce a new design in this style, I think that this subgenre of humanist sans serifs is too narrow a field to support much more than already exists without the whiff of plagiarism: between them, Frutiger, Myriad and Stone Sans have pretty much covered all the bases.</p>

<p>Since my &ldquo;Font Forging Industry&rdquo; website (<a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers</a>) is visited daily by hundreds of visitors from all over the world, I selected the very broad generic legal term &ldquo;forgery&rdquo;, because I could not find a better generic legal term which could be understood by visitors from Netherlands, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Romania etc. (just to quote a few countries from my today&rsquo;s website statistics), who live in different countries with different laws. Of course, in my German-language documents on the &ldquo;Font Forging Industry&rdquo;, I use other very special German legal terms, but these much more specialized German legal terms cannot be generalized for all other countries.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; (in German and in French: &ldquo;Plagiat&rdquo;) suggested by Mr. Hudson has the disadvantage that it is a term, which does not occur in the laws of the countries which I know. For instance, &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; does not occur in German laws, nor does &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; occur in the American nor in the British nor in the French copyright act. For instance, when you download the entire &ldquo;Copyright Law of the United States&rdquo; contained in the PDF file</p>
<p><a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf</a></p>
<p>and when you, after downloading, search via Adobe Acrobat for the term &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; in this PDF file, you will not find any occurrence of this term &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo;. I also checked the British &ldquo;Copyright, Designs and Patents Act&rdquo; and also checked the French copyright code, and as regards Germany, I can say with conviction that the term &ldquo;Plagiat&rdquo; is never used in any of the many German civil and penal laws.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; is a literary term, which may be used in the New York Times Literary Supplement, but it is not a legal term, because it does not occur in American laws and hence does not have a legal definition.</p>

<p>Most companies at least have subsidiaries in Germany  (Adobe, Microsoft, UPS etc.) or even have their headquarters in Germany (e.g. Linotype, FontShop etc.). An exception for example is Monotype which no longer exists in Germany due to bankruptcy.</p>

Can that be done? Are there variations of these fonts? or are you talking about the original designers making variations and licensing them to other Corporations? Is that possible with the CT fonts or the Segoe font?</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;d like to say without intending to be obnoxious, judgemental or demeaning, and that is that at some point a type design becomes so bland, vanilla, average-looking, and otherwise completely undistinguished, that there are plenty of other fonts that it is going to look a lot like for the simple reason that so many people want this kind of disappearing type.

<p>The Segoe font is Monotype&rsquo;s and I don&rsquo;t know what licensing arrangement they have with Microsoft.</p>
<p>The CT fonts belong to Microsoft, so no I was not talking about the original designers licensing variations of these to <em>other corportations.</em> I was talking about Microsoft commissioning a variation of e.g. Corbel optimised for additional functions such as a being UI font or for use in corporate branding. They own the original font outright, so can do with it what they like.</p>

<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t consider myself an expert in any kind of law. I generally avoid legal discussions precisely because I don&rsquo;t think one can make reliable statements, for the reasons you cite. This is part of the reason why I queried the term forgery. Uli explains that he has deliberately chosen this word because of its legal meaning in various countries; that is, he has sought out a word with legal implications to make, I presume, the point that he considers the actions of various companies to be <em>illegal.</em> That&rsquo;s his prerogative, but to me it looks like begging the question: by describing the actions as forgery, he is making a legal judgement on the action and, as you point out, matters of law should be argued by lawyers and decided by judges. Uli chooses a word <em>because it has legal implications</em>, whereas I choose a word that, as you note from the OED, &lsquo;fits the bill nicely&rsquo;, but does not necessarily have legal implications. A difference in personality, I suspect, as much as anything else.</p>
<p>A legal process is already underway regarding Segoe, and I think Linotype are right to take a stand on this. Over the years, Linotype seems to have been the victim of more acts of font plagiarism than any other foundry, and certainly of more blatant and financially significant plagiarism, with Bitstream and Monotype being the worst culprits. Microsoft&rsquo;s primary fault in all this is trusting Monotype to provide original designs. I think the trouble is that by the time these kind of things come to the attention of people who can address them, a massive software product like Vista is in code lock down, with UI font dependencies embedded in the system. At that stage, the cost of removing a font becomes prohibitively high.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to do a better job on examining the originality and provenance of fonts at the licensing stage. This means having, for instance, a panel of knowledgeable and experienced people who can review proposed typefaces and advise if they are uncomfortably close to other designs.</p>

<p>Er, no, it would have to be a group of people who would recognise a Lexicon clone. :)</p>
<p>Morisawa is a competition, and the judging of a large number of entries takes place in a short period of time, in conditions of at least semi-secrecy regarding the identity of the submitted designs and their creators. What I&rsquo;m talking about is a process of examination of individual designs that a company is considering licensing, with reference to outside experts as necessary, capable of judging whether a design is sufficiently original or otherwise kosher (e.g. appropriately licensed, public domain, etc.) It&rsquo;s a process that could take several days, involving research, detailed comparisons, and submission of a written report and recommendations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much of the opinion that one of the ways to stop people doing the wrong thing is to make it easier for them to do the right thing. If the problem is a software company licensing typeface designs that are too similar to existing designs from other parties &ndash; <em>regardless of  the intent or deliberativeness</em> &ndash; then I want to ask what process would prevent that from happening.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need a panel of experts.
Just hire a designer with a reputation based on designing original typefaces.
Stipulate a contract with the usual legalese about the designer guaranteeing that there is no infringement of third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights.
Then post the resulting prototype on Typophile.</p>
<p>Another way would be for the client to provide the designer with a &ldquo;hermetic' room to work in, with a detached computer and no font files &ndash; ie no reference material, and say, &ldquo;come up with some designs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Because if you were to ask a group of any type designers to recreate the Frutiger typeface (from memory), with no reference material, the results would all be different. Even Adrian Frutiger would come up with something different.</p>

<p>Yes, a good start, although originality is only one of the requirements that need to be met.</p>
<p><em>Then post the resulting prototype on Typophile.</em></p>
<p>Companies investing in custom typefaces for unannounced products are not going to show those typefaces off in public.

<p>With ClearType or without ClearType? :)</p>
<p>The small size bitmaps are a product of the outline font and its hinting, so even if the bitmaps themselves are not considered knock-offs, they are a product of an outline font that may be. If MS had made a bitmap font, I doubt there would be this kind of controversy, even if the bitmaps were identical to those generated by an existing TT version of Frutiger (such as that made for MS&rsquo;s eBook reader).</p>
<p>In the case of Segoe, though, the project includes not only the UI fonts but also the use of the design in MS corporate branding. So clearly this typeface is not only going to be seen at 20ppm or less. Indeed, I first saw it in banners at about 600pt.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Also, when Nick wrote &lsquo;I don’t think you need a panel of experts&rsquo;, I should have responded immediately that I&rsquo;m not talkimg about a panel of <em>experts</em> per se. Indeed, a process that relies on individual expertise is generally not a robust process. What is important is a process of review, of exploration, consideration and recommendation. Consultation with experts might form part of the process especially, for instance, where non-Latin fonts are concerned where the provenance of designs can be quite, um, complicated. But the process shouldn&rsquo;t rely on experts. For most cases, all you need is decent research skills and a reasonable amount of time. Cases like Segoe would be the easy ones, where the resemblance is obvious to anyone whose been typographically awake for the past thirty years. Determining whether, for instance, a Bengali typeface is or is not a clone of another is much trickier and needs forensic examination by an expert.</p>
<p><em>One sad thing about this story is that people’s names get indirectly linked to this issue, and are assumed to be associated with the crucial decisions behind the process, when in fact they might even be against it.</em></p>
<p>Indeed. I was trying to find the right words to make this very point, Miguel. One shouldn&rsquo;t assume that everyone as Microsoft thought that Segoe was a good idea.</p>

<p>I know that the entire Segoe family includes branding fonts. In the graphics shown at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</a> or in the Microsoft printed ads, the typeface surely does look a bit like Frutiger. But I was specifically wondering about Segoe UI.</p>
<p>Uli,</p>
<p>no doubt, Erik Faulhaber has worked on the Frutiger Next project but the extent of that work is disputable. This is a typical case of &ldquo;getting credit&rdquo;. Type design only recently became an individual effort &ndash; previously, a large team of people worked on a particular type, and yet typically, only one person got the credit as the &ldquo;designer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Even today, when FF Meta Pro is published, the credited designer is Erik Spiekermann and not &ldquo;Spiekermann, van Rossum, de Groot, Schäfer, Lipton, Schwartz, Safayev, Chayeva, Haratzopoulos et al.&rdquo; If it were so, it would be quite ridiculous anyway.</p>
<p>If you want personal credit, you need to negotiate it upfront in the contract.</p>
<p>Christian Schwartz and Erik Spiekermann collaborated on FF Unit and on FF Meta Headline. Schwartz does get personal credit for FF Meta Headline but not for FF Unit &ndash; this is obviously result of different negotiations in different projects.</p>
<p>The credited designer for Frutiger Next is &ldquo;Adrian Frutiger / Linotype Design Studio&rdquo;. This means that Linotype chose not to personally credit the other designers who worked on the project, including Erik Faulhaber. This is similar for Linotype Univers. This is different for other projects, e.g. Avenir Next is credited as &ldquo;Adrian Frutiger / Akira Kobayashi&rdquo;, just like Palatino Nova and Optima Nova are credited &ldquo;Hermann Zapf / Akira Kobayashi&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Altogether, such decisions are made on a per-project basis, and surely depend on the actual creative input of &ldquo;the other&rdquo; designer. Sometimes, designers arrange collaborations by themselves &ndash; they might hire a collague to draw the small caps or florins in their own typeface if there is a tight deadline.</p>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;junior designer&rdquo; and embark on such a project, make sure to clarify issues such as personal credit <em>upfront</em>. Erik Faulhaber seemingly has not. He has seemingly agreed to hide his name behind the &ldquo;Linotype Design Studio&rdquo; label but now is trying to change reality retroactively. This is not how you work with other people.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, can&rsquo;t you stay on topic? I didn&rsquo;t even mention Lexicon. But if there is a story to tell about that font and Roy, why don&rsquo;t you do everyone a favour and tell it? Somewhere else? Do a little webpage or a Wikipedia entry. It would interest a lot of people and would one hopes be a more permanent record than a blog posting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little interesting that Faul(es)haber has succeeded for quite some months now in imposing the impression, now revealed by Bruno Steinert to be false, that he is the &lsquo;designer&rsquo; of Frutiger Next. Of course he isn&rsquo;t. At Linotype, even Zapf has an art director. There is someone on this thread who could tell us some stories about designing for Linotype with one of their art directors in charge. ( A Lino art director is not necessarily someone on staff, either; distinguished consultants are sometimes brought in.) It isn&rsquo;t necessary to go into details; suffice it to say that it can be a painful experience and may allow the designer almost no latitude for creativity. This may indeed be something of a corporate psychological holdover from Lino&rsquo;s old days when the designer was but a very small cog in a huge manufacturing process. The type designer as star is a recent phenomenon. Working for Lino could be an ego-bruising, but nevertheless a highly instructive experience.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the pleasures of working on a clone is that an art director is not needed; technical fidelity is the only requisite. That leads to a question: We seem to have established that Segoe is an exact duplication of Frutiger with the exception of one or two exceedingly minor details. I would be curious to know if anyone has looked at the spacing. Does that correspond to the data in hitherto released versions of Frutiger? It would be something, not much, if we knew that Segoe&rsquo;s designers had at least done their own spacing. It would say something, again not much, about intent. If the spacing is identical, for example, to Linotype&rsquo;s, that would enhance  the impression that the font was expected to behave identically to Frutiger at a very deep level.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You obviously like Goethe&rsquo;s mother tongue! The medieval compound &ldquo;Faulhaber&rdquo; denoted &ldquo;having &lsquo;much&rsquo; (faul -&gt; viel = much) &lsquo;oats&rsquo; (haber -&gt; hafer = oats)&rdquo;. But the word &ldquo;faul&rdquo;, if derived from the Indoeuropean root &ldquo;pu&rdquo; (compare the English cognate word &ldquo;putrid&rdquo;), denoted in the middle ages &ldquo;the fragrance of a lady&rsquo;s privy parts&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the euphemistic semantics of this word. Goethe used another expression :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does that correspond to the data in hitherto released versions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Frutiger &amp; Frutiger Next and Segoe &amp; Segoe UI have slightly different metrics. Furthermore, some glyphs of Segoe and Segoe UI are identical, whereas some other glyphs are minimally different.</p>
<p>BTW: When will you report about the legal opinion of the retired judge?</p>

<p>Actually, I do know most of the details: enough to give Roy Preston the benefit of the doubt regarding both his intentions and his methods. However, the fact remains the <em>result</em>, the typeface he submitted to Morisawa, is too close to Lexicon for comfort. As I&rsquo;ve written elsewhere, I&rsquo;ve been willing to give Steve Mattheson the benefit of the doubt to: maybe he didn&rsquo;t set out to create a clone of Frutiger, but what matters is the result and how closely it resembles another typeface. In the typical circumstances of judging a competition, these things may slip through from time to time; they should not slip through the process of selecting typefaces to license for major software products, which must be made more rigourous.</p>

<p>And on the marketability of the co-designer&rsquo;s name. Crediting a design to Adrian Frutiger and Akira Kobayashi, is a double-whammy for Linotype, linking to typeface to two very talented designers whose work is widely, and rightly, regarded.</p>
<p><em>He has seemingly agreed to hide his name behind the “Linotype Design Studio” label but now is trying to change reality retroactively.</em></p>
<p>I have to admit that I sometimes find the attribution to &lsquo;Linotype Design Studio&rsquo; troublesome, not least because it is occasionally applied retroactively. What is the &lsquo;Linotype Design Studio&rsquo;? It suggests a room with a group of people drawing glyphs, filling in character sets, something like the drawing departments of old. But the reality is that &lsquo;Linotype Design Studio&rsquo; might refer to Linotype employees, or to freelance designers, or to other companies hired by Linotype. I understand why Linotype choose to use this attribution and, frankly, it is their privilege since they own the results and the contracts allow them to do this. As you note, Adam, the correct time to establish how a project will be credited is during contract negotiations. But as someone with an interest in history, I&rsquo;m disappointed to see some interesting stories disappear behind this generic attribution. Sometimes these stories are interesting cases of international collaboration. Sometimes they involve designers of the calibre of Tim Holloway, who is in no way a lesser designer than Adrian Frutiger or Akira Kobayashi, but whose name lacks their marketing cachet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&hellip;intent</p>
<p>&hellip; result</p>
<p>Hrant, why don&rsquo;t you stop posting for two minutes and create some wonderful static, non-ripostable content about this interesting project?</p>
<p>Nevertheless as to intent and Segoe, that is an excellent point. However, I suspect it&rsquo;s something of a red herring even to pose the question as I shall try to explain if you can bear to bear with me. Because as I understand it, this font was already in Monotype&rsquo;s library of Frutiger clones (which also include Univers, used by HP, as well as Linotype clones designed by others). Part of Monotype&rsquo;s business model, apparently, is selling Linotype clones. I believe I am not mistaken in asserting that Segoe was available as a Frutiger clone before Microsoft came a-knocking? Am I not also right in assuming that Monotype marketed Segoe as a direct copy? Am I not further right in assuming that Microsoft asked for a few trivial changes to be made?</p>
<p>One must also consider the substantial body of intellectual property law that has been evolving on derivative works over the past two decades. If a work can be shown to be derivative, then it is infringing. From this point of view, Myriad would, we may suppose, be found infringing. In the base weight, there are a few characters that are different from Frutiger, and the differences are slight, though real. It is clearly a highly derivative work, unusually so, even for type.</p>
<p>But as regards intent, Myriad is in a different category from Segoe altogether. Developed over a three year period, it was not commissioned to resemble Frutiger, was not intended to be Frutiger, did not start off as Frutiger. It only became Frutiger towards the end of a long, painful developement process when Robert discovered that he simply could not come up with a good design of his own. The sans serif is not his metier, and nor, for that matter, is originality. These are not the qualities which make him an interesting and a good designer.</p>
<p>In the case of Segoe, it is obvious that the font was created either by directly appropriating and manipulating the digital data with the intent of disguising not the design but the origination of the data points, or it was created by tracing over the outlines with the intention of matching them exactly but creating new data points. Whichever it was (and I think Linotype&rsquo;s analysis favours the former technique), it is a very different process from the painful journey that Adobe underwent.</p>
<p>Monotype intended to make a literal copy of Frutiger from the start, and they succeeded. Adobe intended to create an entirely original typeface but one that was nevertheless generic in style. That was John Warnock&rsquo;s simple brief for Myriad: create a generic sans serif.</p>
<p>It only became Frutiger after a very long process in which the designer discovered that he couldn&rsquo;t do it to his satisfaction. One must give him credit for recognizing that, and for spending some years working towards that recognition.</p>
<p>The story of Myriad is an almost heroic, almost tragic narrative of a designer&rsquo;s discovery that he cannot do what he was commissioned to do.  That is something we can all sympathize with. And we can learn from it.</p>
<p>We can also appreciate the many things that Slimbach (and to a much lesser extent Twombley) did to make Frutiger more flexible and useful. It is worth noting, too, that they probably would not have been permitted to do this had Adobe from the start licensed Frutiger for MM development. How they could have achieved this in an entirely ethical, above board fashion is not readily apparent to me. But again, as regards intent, they did not start off with Frutiger in mind, even if they ended, three years later, with Frutiger very much in mind.</p>
<p>The story of Segoe, by contrast, is one of pure pilfery from the very start. Segoe, after all, is only one of the Frutiger clones in Monotype/Ascender&rsquo;s portfolio. There is also the Univers clone, for example, an exact duplicate of that font, which they sold to Hewlett Packard. And there are others.</p>
<p>In other words, we may have to bring ourselves to accept that Segoe is not a unique case. A substantial part of Monotype&rsquo;s business for well over a decade has been the offering of precise Linotype clones to companies who don&rsquo;t wish to pay Linotype&rsquo;s fees.</p>
<p>The root of the problem isn&rsquo;t Segoe. The root of the problem is Monotype&rsquo;s business plan. The Univers/HP clone was only used for branding. It didn&rsquo;t gain mindshare. Only when Monotype&rsquo;s thefts (I will revert to my own preferred word here) became widely apparent on the public stage (which only happened in the case of Palatino/Book Antiqua and Frutiger/Segoe) did ethical and legal questions come to occupy our interest.</p>
<p>Let us even go a little further: had Monotype not stood up at ATypI and presented Book Antiqua as an entirely original design in type history to a distinguished audience which included Hermann Zapf, and had Microsoft not, again, quite publicly presented Segoe as an original design to be considered as such by historians, and had Microsoft furhter not attempted to register the design as legal, we would not be discussing the matter today.</p>
<p>In both these cases, the crime of fraud was quite openly practised. It is this which accounts for our ire.</p>

<p>The only intent that matters when a typeface is published, i.e. made licenseable, is the <em>intent to publish.</em> The thought process that went into producing the typeface is irrelevant, the intent of the designer(s) in producing the typeface is irrelevant, because the decision to publish is in no way dependent on those creative intentions. The creative intentions are part of the process of creating the typeface, not the process of publishing it.</p>
<p>Even more so, such intentions are irrelevant to the decision to license a typeface. You do not license an intention, you license a <em>thing</em>, a product, a result. And the decision to license a typeface must be based on the nature of that thing, not on the real or stated intent of the person who made it. You have to look at the result, the thing. You have to forget all the claims about how it was made, whether they are true or not, and ignore the all explications of the ways in which it is different from other typefaces, and really <em>look</em> at the bloody thing with an honest eye &ndash; and sometimes with a microscope &ndash; and ask &lsquo;Is this thing original enough?&rsquo; And sometimes the answer is no &ndash; sometimes despite the best intentions to create something original and non-derivative &ndash; and then you just have to set that thing aside and go look elsewhere. You have to, because the best intentions don&rsquo;t change the fact that the thing is a clone.</p>

<p>Mr. Hudson&rsquo;s view of American law is in conformity with my view of European law concerning font forgeries. Although there are certain types of forgeries, where also the intent or deliberateness to produce is relevant, e.g. the producing of forged bank notes (which is a crime even if they are not published, i.e. circulated), this deliberateness to produce is not relevant as far as art forgeries and font forgeries are concerned. This, of course, only applies to criminal law. In civil law, e.g. with regard to the decision of the invalidity division about Segoe, no intent is required by Bill Gates and all other Microsoft people. Here negligence is sufficient. Negligence means: &ldquo;Bill Gates should have known that Segoe is a forgery&rdquo;, while deliberateness means: &ldquo;Bill Gates knows that Segoe is a forgery&rdquo;.</p>

When Steve worked on this face he did not copy anything, I&rsquo;m sure of that &lsquo;cause I know Steve and that&rsquo;s just not what he&rsquo;s about. The other point is the one where we say, well, what was Frutiger, (the face). It was a typeface family originally designed to work only on Linotype machines.</p>
<p>As such, the contours would have been placed, in each and every detail, to work perfectly with a specific appearance on Linotype machines. What happened subsequently, with Frutiger output to any and all devices that&rsquo;d take it, with no design compensation in the ps upgrading, means that Frutiger output in 1994, looks a whole lot different and with multiple appearances than Frutiger 1984, rather stable type.</p>
<p>So now, if you take an outline that&rsquo;s a 1984 Frutiger clone, add a new rasterizer, hints, and modifications to the outline for those technical &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo;, now what have you got? How does Frutiger at 14pt 96 dpi CT, compare to Segoe at 14pt 96 dpi CT? Still the same face? Still a knockoff? Win in court? Stop.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I really like your discussion with regard to intent. It is excellent but it seems to be situated outside the substantial legal issue of intent. I see it more as an ethical view than a legal view. I really wish I could get more into this, and the whole derivative art issue as well. Uli, I haven&rsquo;t had any time to talk to anyone, I hope I will in the next few days.</p>
<p>David, you raise issues that could turn some of our assumptions upside down. What you say about Steve has resonance and is exactly what I would have said - before this.</p>
<p>Your points about original design versus later adaptation are also exceptionally well-taken, as are those about me and hastiness. Moreover, would you agree that it is possible to take two identical fonts, space them differently, and come up with two equally valid products that look quite different in print? But that&rsquo;s a red herring.</p>
<p>Yes, it is important to consider the technological evolution of a typeface. However, here, our assumption is that all Frutiger clones, from Bitstream on downwards, are fairly rigidly based on Linotype&rsquo;s photo masters. All the adaptation that is going to be done has already been done, or nearly so, for photo. Here, also, to be specific, we are talking about Segoe in print, not about Segoe in CT2, and not about Segoe UI, except as it is a clearly derivative product of Segoe.</p>
<p>One thing which might help to clarify the issue would be the answer to these questions:</p>
<p>Did Monotype have a specific Frutiger and/or Frutiger Next clone in its OEM library? Who &lsquo;designed&rsquo; it?</p>
<p>Did Monotype have other specific Linotype clones in its OEM library? Who designed them?</p>
<p>Micromillimetre for micromillimetre, how close are Segoe and Frutiger?</p>
<p>I think what you are touching on here is fair use. This is an area in which your thinking is highly evolved, since a lot of your library is based on well-thought out and impeccably provenanced fair use adaptations of earlier designs. I could not possibly overstate my admiration for the absolutely above-board manner in which you have always done this. But isn&rsquo;t it perhaps just a bit too much of a stretch to postulate that others think as you do and do as you do? You have provided the exactly correct model for how to do this. I need to be convinced that Monotype is following your pattern here. Are they? We have asked Microsoft and Monotype/Ascender to speak up. Where are they?</p>
<p>As a postscript, let me give a small illustration of Font Bureau&rsquo;s modus operandi in this respect, from my own experience. In 1993 or 1994, I made my second baby font, a fairly literal adaptation of an 18th century early Didot. As I didn&rsquo;t know then how to draw digitally, I used Linotype Fairfield as my digital basis - with its designer&rsquo;s (Kazcun&rsquo;s) knowledge and informal consent - he was an early mentor. It wasn&rsquo;t Fairfield, far from it. But it had enough of Fairfield remaining for David to say, sorry, we love it, but it&rsquo;s too close to Fairfield.</p>
<p>Believe me, guys, it would have taken a real expert to know that Fairfield was involved in this substantial redesign. But David saw through it at once. And no, that wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that he would put in his library.</p>
<p>So I learned how to digitise from scratch. Nothing could be easier, really, once you catch on to it. And I developed the font a lot further, in many directions. It now has nothing whatever to do with Fairfield. Hey David, wanna see it?</p>
<p>And David, on a serious note, do you think that any of the kind of rigorous aesthetic and ethical thought you put into your work has anything to do with the production of Segoe?</p>

<p>As regards Mr. Troop&rsquo;s interesting motivational hypotheses about the making of Segoe and Myriad, it might be also of interest for Mr. Troop to learn that in European copyright handbooks the following two psychological theories concerning &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; copyists are discussed by law experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cryptomnesia</li>
</ol>
<p>The term cryptomnesia (which was also contained in the old Webster&rsquo;s Third New International Dictionary) is defined as &ldquo;the appearance of memory images, which are not recognized as such, but which appear as original creations&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With regard to a hypothetical &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; copyist of the font Frutiger, cryptomnesia would mean that the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; copyist studied and memorized the letter forms of Frutiger a long time ago, e.g. by repeatedly using this font for typesetting advertising headlines. Now much later when he starts to design a &ldquo;new&rdquo; font, the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; copyist &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; draws these Frutiger letter forms from memory, because he does no longer remember that he once used and memorized the Frutiger letter forms. In other words, the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; copyist thinks that he is creating &ldquo;new&rdquo; letter forms, while in fact he is only reproducing existing letter forms memorized long ago.</p>
<p>Some psychologists and law experts claim that the phenomenon of cryptomnesia may happen, whereas others reject this as psychological nonsense.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Double Creation</li>
</ol>
<p>Whereas patent law is based on the principle of priority with the consequence that two identical patents are not allowed, copyright law does not know this principle of priority. Therefore, at least theoretically, two different persons, if they do not know each other&rsquo;s works and provided they (completely independently from one another) both create exactly the same work, they will both become copyright owners of the same identical work.</p>
<p>For very short and simple works, e.g. for TV and radio jingles (technically musical works consisting of a few notes only) double creation has been regarded as possible, although I do deny that. For instance, for jingles consisting of 8 tones out of 12 different musical-scale tones (c, cis, d, es &hellip; h) there are, mathematically speaking, nearly 20 million (exactly 19,958,400) different combinations of 8-tone jingles.</p>
<p>In any case, the German copyright law requires in the rare hypothetical cases of double creations that the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; double creator proves that he really made a completely independent double creation (onus of proof).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli&rsquo;s discussion of Cryptomnesia and double creation helps us deepen our thought and hone in more sharply on the issues. Others will correct me if I am wrong here, but I don&rsquo;t think it is conceivable that either crytomnesia or double creation are viable defenses either in the cases of Myriad or Segoe, since it is obvious that the designers were consciously and intimately familiar with Frutiger. Not only that, but their colleagues, managers and associates were consciously and intimately familiar with Frutiger.</p>
<p>There is no one in the entire type industry who is not consciously and intimately familiar with the design of Frutiger.</p>
<p>On the contrary. What we are seeing here is that intellectual property ethics and law are moving faster than we are. Many of us may have some painful adjustments to make in the years to come. I think much of what John had to say, for example, is beautifully worked out in and of itself, but doesn&rsquo;t take into account the context of what is legally and ethically happening in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Again, this only comes into focus so acutely in the case of Frutiger/Segoe because it is so intimate a part both of Microsoft&rsquo;s corporate image and so intimate and critical a part of the highly evolved, highly complex product on which it is staking its success for the next decade. Microsoft&rsquo;s dilemma is that it cannot succeed if its product cannot legally be sold within the European Union.</p>
<p>And again: were this a matter of a knockoff used for corporate ID (for a company somewhat less prominent than MS), one that was never registered as an original design or trademarked, no issue would arise because nobody would know about it.</p>
<p>Microsoft is in a mess. Its legal strategy is in shambles. I don&rsquo;t see what ultimate choice they have but to settle with Linotype and I predict this will quietly happen, as it nearly did last year.</p>
<p>And that will be good. Linotype deserves the money. Frutiger deserves the money. I only hope he gets it before he dies. Given how bad Microsoft will look if they drag this out until Frutiger is no longer alive, I encourage Microsoft to move towards a very rapid settlement.</p>
<p>To be blunt, Si, and all the rest of you at Microsoft, if you get Frutiger on board now, he&rsquo;s an asset and you&rsquo;ll be heroes, although you&rsquo;ll be poorer heroes: by a penny per OS you sell. But if you wait until he&rsquo;s gone, you&rsquo;ll always be seen as Pontius Pilate. Is that the outcome you desire? Can you live with that outcome on both the personal and corporate levels?</p>
<p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether you will settle, but when.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;David: If someone had come up to you — let’s say 5 years ago, or at least long before this story had become an issue — with an unidentified printout of Segoe, asking for your comments on his/her original type design, what do you think you would have said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too close to Frutiger for our &ldquo;print&rdquo; library, why don&rsquo;t you do an online face:)&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey David, wanna see it?&rdquo;
Sure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And David, on a serious note, do you think that any of the kind of rigorous aesthetic and ethical thought you put into your work has anything to do with the production of Segoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, that wasn&rsquo;t serious?  Yes, I do believe that as far as resolution resistant designs go, Madison and Co. do as much work in figuring out the right design as we do in our print fonts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, if a dozen type designers were asked to recreate the Frutiger A, it’s unlikely that any would match the exact angles, overshoot, stem taper, height of the crossbar, and stem thicknesses. &quot;</p>
<p>I think that question is clear, and the answer is no, they would not make the same A.    But, if they were all told that the A had to be on 37/54ths of an em, and that 100 unit stems would be required to produce a proper &ldquo;book&rdquo; face, then they would all be extremely close, and some, if enough we solicited, would be exactly the same. That, in a technologically constricted world, is what happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on all sides and the middle of these arguments time and time again, and I tell you, nothing anyone says, (besides me of course), makes sense, until you&rsquo;ve got them both on a light table and you can trace the differences and similarities to genuine typographic motives, (not including of course, &ldquo;can you make me a copy?&quot;), or you can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Fair enough. So, has anybody here actually done that? And David, would it count if I took the two fonts into Fog 5, one font in the foreground, other in the background, scale to match, and examined at 800%, 3200%, whatever?

<p>I wonder why you do not that yourself, if you think it is that important.</p>
<p>In the UPS case, a reduction to 95.3 % (= a reduction by 4.7 %) of the glyph coordinates of the forgery &ldquo;UPS Sans&rdquo; yielded the glyphs of the font &ldquo;FF Dax&rdquo;. But this reduction was only the first &ldquo;crude task&rdquo; performed by the font forgers who had been commissioned by United Parcel Service to forge the FF Dax font. Thereafter, as a second &ldquo;refined task&rdquo;, these professional font forgers were ordered by UPS to make a few conspicuous modifications to a small selection of glyphs, as has been demonstrated by me on pages 9 and 15 in my documentation <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/barmen.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/barmen.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>and sometimes with a microscope (Mr. Hudson)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No court judge in Europe would examine a font with a microscope. The decision of the invalidity division of the sixth of February 2006 has clearly shown that fonts are compared by the invalidity division (and by European law courts, for that matter) with the naked eye, not with microscopes and similar tools. Such tools (microscopes, X-ray, chemicals etc.) are applied in art forgery cases, but not in font forgery cases, where ordinary printed alphabets typeset in ordinary point sizes and viewed with the ordinary human eye is all that is required in order to arrive at the conclusion that two different fonts &ldquo;should be considered identical&rdquo; (see invalidity decision).</p>
<p>PS: Here is an example of cryptomnesia. I have just wondered why I write &ldquo;naked eye&rdquo;. Did I &ldquo;create&rdquo; this expression? Apparently not. I now think that I once seem to have read this saying: &ldquo;Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with the naked eye&rdquo;. But did this saying really have this wording? Was it &ldquo;&hellip;with the steady eye&rdquo;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A very preliminary impression, comparing Lino/Adobe Frutiger to Segoe UI. Steps are 1, open Segoe UI in Fontlab, 2, convert to PS, 3, open in Fog 5, 4, place Lino Frutiger in background, 5, scale 98.04% to match x-height. Frutiger is slightly wider and slightly heavier, making a direct comparison difficult without adjusting weight and horizontal scale. Even so, several lowercase glyphs are, in what seems to be the common consensus, too close, but there are some differences and it is clear that there is not the intention, here, to make an absolutely literal copy. However, this is Segoe UI, not Segoe, and has been further altered for UI purposes. There are many, many similarities, and there are differences. It seems hardly conceivable that the font was drawn without reference to Frutiger, but how and to what extent, I can&rsquo;t conclude at this early date. I would appreciate hearing the impressions of someone more skilled in font forensics. The last time I checked a font for signs of literal pilfery was several years ago when I checked Le Monde against several cuts of Times New Roman and discovered and published indisputable evidence of point pilfering from a specific cut of Times New Roman that Adobe shipped with Illustrator 6. I see no evidence of point pilfering with Segoe, but then, it would be hard to do that given that one is in PS format and the other in TT, and I am comparing PS to a TT conversion whose quality I have not tested. However, the difference in design between Times and Le Monde is far greater than the difference between Segoe UI and Lino/Adobe Frutiger. The purpose of the Le Monde analysis was to discover if Porchez was telling the truth when he first asserted that he had point pirated, or whether he was telling the truth when he later denied it. I concluded and illustrated that the first statement was the true one. In either case, it was indisputable that the designs were substantially different. Here, the purpose is not to discover if point piracy exists, since it is beyond my skill to do that cross-format, but to discover if design piracy exists. Between these two fonts I will only for the time being adopt the phrase used I think by both John and Adam, that the fonts are too close. I can&rsquo;t find my other Segoe fonts, so the rest will have to wait until tomorrow. I also don&rsquo;t know what the differences are in the base weights of Lino/Adobe Frutiger and Linotype Frutiger Next, so those comparisons have to be made too.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;d like further to point out that when I sent my Didot to David years ago, that was in the days when we still sent paper samples only. David&rsquo;s eyes detected its digital derivation from Fairfield without the benefit of computer software. That guy doesn&rsquo;t need to look at points to figure out what&rsquo;s going on!</p>
<p>Speaking only for myself: if I had to take the idea I have in my head of Frutiger, and draw something to it as close as I could, without being permitted to consult large printouts of Frutiger or anything I could trace over, I don&rsquo;t think I could come up with something that was as close to Frutiger as Segoe UI is. But that&rsquo;s all I can say. Others have completely different skill sets and I am sure there are many who could do a better job of this hypothetical task than me.</p>
<p>Again, there are some German display types of the 1920s that have some  pre-Frutiger features. Were I to adapt one of these bold and compressed fonts to a normal weight, as I have sometimes thought of doing, I doubt that the result would be considered to be a Frutiger clone. But that&rsquo;s just me.</p>

<p>Of course everything I have just written about my preliminary but time-consuming comparison is more or less invalidated by this . . .</p>
<p>As I have suggested before, many of us in the font industry have some catching up to do. The EU needs to have common IP laws to the greatest extent possible; in practice that means that the laws most favourable to artists/creators will be adopted. Corporations with international product lines will have to comply with EU standards (just as DVD-burner manufacturers have just had quite painfully to retool to comply with EU standards), and eventually, US and British laws will probably follow suit, long after US and British manufacturers have had to. The ethics many of us have spent a long time working out are not likely to meet the standards Uli has described above. I can imagine this having some good effects and some bad effects for the type industry.</p>

<p>Good point David. If a type designer is asked to better the performance of a particular font (with quite specific parameters of usage), wherever he/she starts, the result is going to be, to all intents and purposes, the same typeface &ndash; if not the same font. It&rsquo;s a testimony to the virtue of the original typeface. I&rsquo;ve done that, started with a different font, massaged it to the client&rsquo;s needs, and even though no point piracy was involved, it ended up in a state where a forensic typographer could probably have proved that some piracy was involved. But the typeface was the &ldquo;open source&rdquo; Century (much of it indistinguishable from Bodoni), and in a display usage that Benton or Bodoni could not have envisaged. I wouldn&rsquo;t have attempted the same kind of thing with Frutiger.</p>
<p>So a lot of responsibility falls on the creative director of the vehicle for which the typeface is intended, and the brief given to the type designer. If a brand&rsquo;s typography is predicated on a certain type of layout that demands a Frutiger-ish typeface, that&rsquo;s asking for trouble. To avoid trouble, an older typeface should be used, or a genre with more flexibility, or best of all, a fresh kind of layout that prompts an original type design.</p>
<p>Why does an OS typography have to be generically bland? Apple has consistently pointed the way in terms of GUI style, and MS has followed. But the types (with the exception of Chicago) have dragged up the rear. Apple&rsquo;s present OS face is a bit Optima-ish and slightly old-fashioned. The door is wide open for a new &ldquo;square&rdquo; or techno OS face, surely the widespread use of pixel-fonts on web sites has paved the way. Companies whose software products are up-to-date end up using vintage typefaces. The pride-of-place given to type revivals and the millstone of traditionalism drag down typography, and have a lot to answer for.</p>

In one sense, Lucida Grande is progressive, in bringing a new degree of subtlety to the table (eg ascender taller than cap height), but as a classic face with Optima-like proportions and contrast, it is going backwards to go forwards.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&lsquo;Why does an OS typography have to be generically bland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Because we are all using the computer to express our thoughts and from the OS we want the closest thing to transparency we can attain?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think Frutiger is a good choice for the interface. Frankly, nothing beats Helvetica/Arial for me &ndash; except Geneva. I don&rsquo;t want the interface font doing <em>anything</em> to distract me.</p>
<p>For my DOS word processor, XyWrite, I like but don&rsquo;t love Lucida Console at 28 points on a 1920x1200 screen, which gives me about 40 lines of text. So many more wonderfully transparent text fonts seemed to exist in the bitmap, monospace days, real triumphs of style and getting the most out of the least. There was real creativity when you were confined to an 8x10 grid or whatever it was. And now . . . creativity . . . reach for what - - - Frutiger? ? ?</p>
<p>How about this goal: the font that places the minimum distance between me and the machine? I have a feeling that wouldn&rsquo;t look much like Frutiger or any of the other sans serifs we think we know and understand. There&rsquo;s a problem here: we&rsquo;re approaching the screen from too much of a print perspective. We need a clean slate with a clean screen perspective that doesn&rsquo;t owe anything to print.</p>

The base weight of Segoe (not Segoe UI) is, as I pointed out for Segoe UI, a little narrower and a little lighter than Lino/Adobe Frutiger. The same is true for Segoe. How to arrive at a true picture of what might and might not have been manipulated?</p>
<p>I took unconverted PS files of Segoe, Segoe Bold, Segoe condensed, and Segoe Bold condensed, and in less time than it takes to describe, I had a multiple master. I put Frutiger in the Mask layer and then scaled it 98.04% as before, hz and vt. With Fontlab, it&rsquo;s a cinch to slide until you get one of several possible good matches to Frutiger, which here is about 146 for weight and 1157 for width.</p>
<p>In the screen shot, the red outline represents Frutiger, the dark green outline represents Segoe, and the grey fill represents the interpolation/extrapolation between the four Segoe weights which constitute the MM.</p>
<p>What relevance does this have? What conclusions can we come to? I have no idea. Here&rsquo;s the screen shot. More to come if anyone&rsquo;s interested.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli: <em>No court judge in Europe would examine a font with a microscope.</em></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t talking about a court, I was talking about a process for prevention at the pre-licensing stage. I don&rsquo;t see much point in me stating legal opinions because I&rsquo;m neither a lawyer nor a judge. So I&rsquo;m focusing on the question &lsquo;What can be done, practically, to prevent this kind of thing from happening?&rsquo; Of course, this presumes goodwill, i.e. that a company like Microsoft wants to do the right thing or, at least, wants to avoid getting into this sort of mess, being accused of these kinds of things, paying lots of money to lawyers, and having judges in important foreign markets decide against them.</p>
<p>When I made reference to a microscope, I was alluding to the kind of forensic analysis that is sometimes necessary to detect a process of deliberate, concealed derivation. Any moderately experienced typographer can look at Segoe and Frutiger side-by-side and come to the conclusion that the former looks very much like the latter, even if some may disagree about whether it looks <em>too much</em> like the latter, or whether the coincidence of the outlines is significant in a type designed primarily for screen, or whether the intent to copy is deliberate, or whether the licensing is evidence of deliberate intent or negligence.</p>
<p>But the number of people who can authoritatively say, for instance, that Bengali typeface X is derived from Bengali typeface Y is quite small, and the if the derivation is concealed by changes to some details or proportions a close forensic analysis is necessary to determine the relationship of the two designs. A court might not look closely enough. The typographic community that is discussing Segoe at such length might not know or care enough about Bengali typography to interest itself. But the questions of originality, derivation, intent and negligence are the same, and should be addressed <em>at the typeface selection stage,</em> before the licensing contracts are signed, before the fonts are shipped in beta products, before the lawyers get involved.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One more comment about that e. What would it now take to turn Frutiger into an exact duplicate of Segoe? Not much. I got a pretty exact match by moving a few handles exactly 10 or exactly 20 units, and by moving one point exactly 10 units. Two things make me uncomfortable: (1) how easy it is to move handles 1 and 10 unit increments in Fontlab with the cursor keys&ndash;a feature suggestion for which I am responsible; (2) that it is possible to get from here to there with just a few 10 or 20 unit pushes of the arrows via the cursor keys &ndash; in other words, less than ten keystrokes altogether. Again, what does this mean, if anything? Again, I have no idea. &lsquo;Je n&rsquo;impose rien; je ne propose rien: j&rsquo;expose&rsquo; &ndash; if I may make use of a rather mischievous bit of imposture.</p>
<p>Have I just succeeded in reverse-engineering Segoe? I don&rsquo;t know. I doubt it.</p>
<p>For one thing, I suspect that other characters would require different interpolation/extrapolation settings to get a good match &ndash; and for evidence of a purely mechanical or purely cynical copy we need to see global manipulations at work. For another, I am not experienced in this kind of analysis, so I can&rsquo;t tell how significant any of my findings, so far, are. For example, I have discovered that it is quite easy to match the Frutiger and Segoe e. But I have not tried the same experiment with 30 or 40 other fonts and with other characters. What if it were nearly as easy with some of those? Then what I have shown here would have little significance. On the other hand, if it were very difficult to accomplish the transformation with many other fonts, then I think I would (might) have found out something that was at least a factor worth considering within a larger frame. Finally, let&rsquo;s not forget the astonishing passage in one of Walter Tracy&rsquo;s books where he shows how Monotype in the 1930s only had to change a few characters in Gill Sans to come up with an effective lookalike for Futura. That&rsquo;s important for two reasons: because Gill and Futura are supposed to be so different philosophically and practically (the one &lsquo;geometric&rsquo;, the other &lsquo;humanist&rsquo; &ndash; that latter being a word I would like to see excised from the type vocabulary as it is so value laden that it will inevitably be misused); and because it shows - shucks! - that Mono was already doing this way back when.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to say that Linotype was always the more successful company, and that Monotype was always looking for ways to get a piece of Lino&rsquo;s cake? I don&rsquo;t know enough about the financial and competitive history of the companies to hazard a guess there.</p>
<p>So after all of this, I&rsquo;m left with what we started out: (1) the feeling clearly articulated by John and Adam, and shared by most others, that the fonts are too close; (2) Linotype&rsquo;s victory with the EU; (3) Microsoft&rsquo;s legal acknowledgement that the fonts are identical &ndash; at least within the terms of that tribunal.</p>
<p>I guess I should have a look at the italic of Segoe and Frutiger Next, but I&rsquo;m not looking forward to it. I do have work to do!</p>

<p>In this thread, there have been used so many inappropriate law terms (pilfery, piracy, plagiarism, theft etc.) that it was not possible for me to comment them all. Since Mr. Troop quoted Goethe, I assume that he can read my German documents at my website, so that he can read the full legal details in German language.</p>
<p>For those who cannot read my German documents concerning the legal situation of fonts in Germany (e.g. my documents kunstwerke.pdf, computerprogramme.pdf etc.), I mention here briefly that &ldquo;on principle&rdquo; (&ldquo;grundsätzlich&rdquo;, i.e. in most cases) fonts are NOT copyrightable in Germany. Therefore, with regard to the Segoe case, I always used the legal term &ldquo;forgery&rdquo; and never used the legal term &ldquo;infringement&rdquo; (&ldquo;copyright infringement&rdquo; or &ldquo;design infringement&rdquo;), because Frutiger and Frutiger Next are neither protected by the German copyright law (UrhG) nor protected by the German design law, for different legal reasons. Therefore, Frutiger Next could not be registered as a design by the German Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (aka &ldquo;Heideldruck&rdquo;) which is the owner of the subsidiary Linotype GmbH.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If Frutiger and Frutiger Next were protected by the German copyright law (Urheberrechtsgesetz), then Heideldruck could sue Microsoft for damages (which would be much much higher than &ldquo;one penny per OS sold &ldquo;) on the grounds of copyright infringement (§ 97 UrhG) and in addition could enforce by court that Microsoft does not sell Windows Vista with Segoe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Frutiger and Frutiger Next were protected by the German design law (Geschmacksmustergesetz), then Heideldruck could sue Microsoft for damages on the grounds of design infringement (§ 41 GeschmMG) and in addition could enforce by court that Microsoft does not sell Windows Vista with Segoe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The decision of the invalidity division only has the effect that Heideldruck, which was not allowed to register the fonts Frutiger and Frutiger Next as design, could achieve the annulment of the illegal registration made by Microsoft which had deliberately deceived the registration office when it registered its forgery &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo; as &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;novel&rdquo; design.</p>

I am still trying to figure out exactly what the possible implications of Uli&rsquo;s coinage Heideldruck might be. Druck can mean many things, including printing, being under pressure, browbeating, etc. Uli, give us a hand.</p>
<p>I see here two great summations of the issues here. Uli&rsquo;s</p>
<p>&lsquo;The decision of the invalidity division only has the effect that Heideldruck, which was not allowed to register the fonts Frutiger and Frutiger Next as design, could achieve the annulment of the illegal registration made by Microsoft which had deliberately deceived the registration office when it registered its forgery “Segoe” as “new” and “novel” design.&rsquo;</p>
<p>and David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too bad, it might require chemical sampling of the brain to know for sure if a font is a forgery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What oft was thought but n&rsquo;er so well expres&rsquo;t&rsquo;. What can we really know about what happened here without being inside the heads of the principal actors? Do they themselves any longer know what they did, or why? We only have their actions, and what we can deduce from their actions, which is something but not everything.</p>
<p>Finally, a bit of literary criticism. Hofmannstahl has Klytemnästra memorably speak, &lsquo;Was die Warheit ist, das bringt kein Mensch heraus&rsquo; which I would loosely translate as, &lsquo;What truth is, mere mankind cannot know, only the Gods can.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m adding the glosses &lsquo;mere&rsquo; and the phrase about the Gods because I think the context demands it. But the question arises, is K speaking the truth when she says we cannot know it?</p>
<p>We have all the elements of a 21st style Greek tragedy here. The clock&rsquo;s ticking for Adrian, whose font is the improbable subject of our drama, and we are still in considerable suspense as to what the other actors have done, will do, and why.</p>
<p>Funny thing, though, as it plays out: the Dreyfusard is not normally a silent crittur.</p>

<p>It is neither a joke nor a mystery. That&rsquo;s how here TV and Press call this big printing maschine factory (with 24,000, in words twenty-four thousand employees), which wholly owns this very very tiny Linotype GmbH font outfit (with only circa twenty full-time employees).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Great point, Nick. I have always distinguished between point piracy, which is unimportant unless you make an issue out of it by fibbing about it, and design piracy, which annoys me much more. The two are completely different. I too have sometimes point pirated from myself. However, entirely philosophically, I would propose that where possible, fresh digitisations should be made. I think you are more likely to get into a design&rsquo;s skin when you digitise it afresh. Obviously, however, time does not always allow that, and not every project is so important. That said, I have wasted an awful lot of time in the past by drawing individual serifs, etc. etc. etc. What a waste of time. Missing the forest for the trees. But hey, I wasn&rsquo;t, like many of us, ready to see the forest at first.</div>

<p>I agree, sort of. A lot depends on how close the source and the derivative are, and how clear an idea you have of what the new design is all about. If the new design idea is insufficiently resolved, and for want of decision reiterates features of the prior, rather than merely using its outlines for convenience, then there can be problems.</p>

<p>Honestly, I see nothing wrong with Fog 4/5&rsquo;s floating point points - that gives you pretty infinite flexibility, and FontLab can deal with floating points, no doubt more in the future. And that&rsquo;s just talking about classic Postscript limitations. Furthermore, you are assuming that the designer&rsquo;s idea is greater than conventional digitisation allows, which is pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;like think of Raph’s and others’ issues with beziers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t what you can achieve, but how easily. You can draw with Raph&rsquo;s techniques and convert to Bezier, and vice versa. As long as you have the patience to deal with the technical demands of the drawing system you are using, you can accomplish anything you want - it&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s a bit more labour involved. But I think that&rsquo;s true of every system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the problem is digital per se, but the specific limitations of 1,000 em traditional postscript. There are plenty of ways to get round that, even now.</p>
<p>When you say no digitisation process is perfect you might just as well say no printing process is perfect, no rasteriser is perfect, no eye is perfect, no art, no soul.</p>
<p>When Edith Wharton lay on her deathbed, she discussed Balzac with her friend Elsina Tyler, who asked how she could possibly admire Balzac so much, as he was such a poor stylist. Wharton replied, &lsquo;You might just as well say that the streets are paved with cobblestones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But do these issues belong here? And would someone besides me please volunteer to do some Frutiger Next/Segoe Italic comparisons? Or can it be conceded that we don&rsquo;t need them? Can anyone suggest predecessor designs that might be of interest? I am still not entirely confident I have got my head around David Berlow&rsquo;s discussion of sans italics in TBR/TBF, with the interesting observations about teardrops and male and female something or others. One of the things that is valuable about that small essay is that it provides some new and useful analytical terminology for type taxonomy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was ignoring the whole one-cent per OS story because it seemed so improbable as to be irrelevant. Microsoft only ever pay a one-time fee for a font license, and everyone in the business knows that. Certainly Linotype know it because they had already licensed Frutiger to MS for the eBook reader. I don&rsquo;t know what the terms of that license were, but knowing that MS like to leave the door open, I would be very surprised if it didn&rsquo;t contain provisions for extension of the license. The strangest thing about Segoe is just how unnecessary it was <em>if MS wanted Frutiger.</em> I have little doubt that they could have had Frutiger, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have cost them an unreasonable amount.</p>
<p>I think the only way to make sense of that is to consider that MS did <em>not</em> want Frutiger, and actually wanted something new and fresh and original to be the flagship typeface of their new operating system. Splendid as Frutiger is, it is a design three decades old. How do you make a marketing splash about that? No, I think MS really wanted a new typeface, and maybe the people making the decisions there thought they were getting one. That Monotype delivered a Frutiger-look-alike doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that this is what Microsoft asked for. They could have asked for nothing more controversial, or more precise, than &lsquo;a new sans serif design suitable for use as a UI font&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before commissioning Segoe, Microsoft did, Le Times has heard from Linotype, try to license Frutiger, but baulked at Linotype’s price: one penny per OS sold. Kudos to Microsoft for realizing that pennies add up to an unacceptable and unfair shareholder burden.
I got this information in 2004 from a source at Linotype. I have the interview on tape. I will not disclose my source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Steinert&rsquo;s statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1-cent story is entirely fabricated and totally unfounded. It is regrettable that such lies are enthusiatically promulgated on the web without any examination. (Die 1 cent-Geschichte ist frei erfunden und entbehrt jeglicher Grundlage. Es ist bedauernswert, daß solche Lügen ohne weiteres Hinterfragen mit Begeisterung im Web weiter werbreitet werden.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either Mr. Troop&rsquo;s statement is a lie or Mr. Steinert&rsquo;s statement is a lie.
Therefore, either Mr. Bill Troop is a lier or Mr. Bruno Steinert is a lier.</p>
<p>FontShop quoted Mr. Troop, and Mr. Steinert at the FontShop blog therefore implicitly declared that Mr. Troop is a lier. Conversely, Mr. Troop implicitly declared that Mr. Steinert is a lier, because the alleged &ldquo;penny-deal&rdquo; would have been negotiated by Mr. Steinert himself, because, as I said in my previous posting to this thread, Linotype GmbH is a very very tiny font outfit with only circa twenty full-time employees plus a couple of occasional free-lancers, for instance the students Mr. Adam Twardoch and Mr. Daniel Reynolds and for instance the apprentice and presumed lier Mr. Erik Faulhaber, who claims to be the designer of &ldquo;Frutiger Next&rdquo;, which is considered a lie by Mr. Steinert. The majority of these circa twenty full-time employees are simple clerks who do not make an &ldquo;interview on tape&rdquo;. Therefore, in view of this tiny outfit, there remains only Mr. Bruno Steinert himself who could have given an &ldquo;interview on tape&rdquo;, provided that Mr. Troop is not a lier who is telling us lies.</p>
<p>By using the expression &ldquo;entirely fabricated and totally unfounded&rdquo;, Mr. Steinert declares that he did not negotiate at all with Microsoft concerning Segoe, thus by his unequivocal statement Mr. Steinert declares that he made neither a 1-cent licence offer nor a 1-penny licence offer nor a 2-cent licence offer nor a 3-cent licence offer nor any other licence offer. Provided that Mr. Steinert is not a lier, this would be in accord with German laws, because by German laws, the Linotype GmbH would not be allowed to negotiate a &ldquo;licence&rdquo; in view of the illegal forgery Segoe. If someone forges banknotes, you are not allowed to &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; with the forger a &ldquo;licence&rdquo; for the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to distribute the forged banknotes. Likewise, if someone forges a painting, the author of the original painting is not allowed to &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; with the forger a &ldquo;licence&rdquo; for the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to distribute the forgery of his original painting. Likewise, if someone forges a font, the author of the original font is not allowed to &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; with the forger a &ldquo;licence&rdquo; for the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to distribute the forgery of the original font. But the author of the original font (in this case Mr. Adrian Frutiger) may try to claim damages and may try to claim that the forged font (in this case the forgery &ldquo;Segoe&rdquo;) is not distributed.</p>

<p>I assumed that when Mr. Troop said &ldquo;for pennies per OS shipment&rdquo;, he meant that if you divided the one-time fee by the number of expected users, you&rsquo;d get pennies per font.</p>

<li>New development concerning my message of 15th March 2006</li>
</ol>
<p>In my message of 15th March (scroll up to this message in this thread) I mentioned that Microsoft as a monopolist has repeatedly ignored the EU anti-trust laws and that at that time in March the European Anti-Trust Commission instituted a new lawcourt action against the illegal behaviour of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Today, 12th July 2006, Microsoft was sentenced to a compulsory monetary fine of 280,000,000 Euros (roughly 350,000,000 Dollars) due to the fact that Microsoft refused to comply with the European laws. The supreme anti-trust commissioner Mrs. Neelie Kroes clearly (and with a grain of sarcasm) stated in the decision that even the huge company Microsoft is not permitted to ignore the laws and is not allowed to rise above the laws.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>New development concerning my message of 13th March 2006</li>
</ol>
<p>In my message of 13th March (scroll up to this message in this thread) I stated that the decision of 6th February 2006 of the EU invalidity division against Microsoft concerning the illegal font Segoe was eligible for court appeal by Microsoft within the next two months.</p>
<p>For legal details on appeals see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/segoe.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/segoe.pdf</a> etc.
Especially read law file <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/segoe4.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/segoe4.pdf</a>, page 23</p>
<p>Microsoft which seems to have recognized and accepted that Segoe is an illegal font, did NOT make such a court appeal against the EU decision.</p>
<p>This non-appeal has the legal consequence that the font Segoe is illegal and remains illegal, at least in the European Union. And this means that selling the illegal font Segoe as component of the forthcoming new version of Windows (&ldquo;Windows Vista&rdquo;) will be illegal, at least in Europe.</p>
