body: Why is it that, in the Adobe CS3 suite, indesign is the only logo in all caps?
  I know Indesign is one word and that if they did the letters for Adobe indesign
  there would be a conflict with illustrator. But still, why not just make it Id instead
  of ID?

  body: "The official spelling is \"InDesign,\" perhaps set with what Bringhurst calls
    \"an extra helping of capitals\" because indesign is a made-up word. Then again
    so is \"Photoshop,\" so who knows. \r\n\r\nEdit: also check out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_incopy\">InCopy</a>.
    whose icon also, arguably, contains a capital (albeit a small one, it's hard to
    tell). \r\n\r\nDouble edit: Wait, you're right. Shouldn't the I in \"Ai\" be capped?
    And After Effects is \"AE\"...I can't find the pattern either. Gah!"

    software, people are <em>still</em> going on about the icons. Which is, somewhat
    surprisingly, more than I can say about the rest of CS3. I sort of assumed that
    the new Photoshop features and the new interface would at least be getting some
    nice attention, but maybe Adobe\u2019s fast-paced release cycle is putting people
    off. "

  body: The basic set of tools needed is so simple. I'm glad the apps are more stable
    now but I wish they had a lite suite with bare bones versions, something like
    Illustrator 3.X used to be.

    it has a lowercase. Easy. I would guess for Illustrator they face readability
    issues and their test group didn''t like the idea of too vertical lines so they
    settled on the next best thing. '

    apart with small icons active really simple. but i wish they'd been more proactive
    about consistency.\r\n\r\npretty clear they didn't use a smallcaps I because someone
    thought it'd look like a lowercase l, never mind that flash has an example of
    what one would look like.\r\n\r\nillustrator's also the only one of the suite
    to use \"adobe\" in the abbreviation.\r\n\r\nwhy do device central, flash video
    encoder, and acrobat have actual icons?\r\n\r\nmakes no sense."

    is where the icons were first introduced. John Nack says, quoting Ryan Hicks,
    that "The mnemonics use a custom cut of Gauge, a typeface Robert [Slimbach] has
    currently in development. It was his recommendation that the type work the way
    it does, mixing upper/lower and cap/small cap based on both phonetics and aesthetics.
    He breathed a bit of life into the system for sure."

  body: sharon's point is a good one. "Id" being a word, and "ID" being a term used
    often in design, the small cap choice works a lot better in this case.
