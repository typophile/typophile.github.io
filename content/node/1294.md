body: I&#39;m hoping someone can identify the typefaces for both ESD and THE ENGINEERING
  SOCIETY OF DETROIT. For the ESD, the closest I can come up with is Helvetica Black
  Italic, which isn&#39;t a match. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16238.gif"

  body: '&#39;ESD&#39; could be a custom emboldened version of Helvetica Black Italic.
    The &#39;Engineering Society&#39; text is definitely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/verdana/">
    Verdana Bold</a>.'
