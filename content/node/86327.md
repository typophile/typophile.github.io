  and inserts of his Merz journal? I'm interested not only in the font he used for
  the title (which has been a previous topic on this forum in 2008, though unsolved)
  but also the fonts used for the 5 and the 7 (below) and the ARP MAPPE subheading.\r\n\r\nI
  am fairly certain these are printed from wood type.  We also know that Schwitters
  printed this Merz portfolio (and some others) at the A. Molling print shop in Hannover.
  And that he was  affiliated with the typesetter Paul Vogt in these years (of PEUVAG
  Druckerei).  \r\n\r\nEven if the fonts can't be identified precisely -- Any insight
  into what typefaces Molling's shop might have had on hand? Would they have been
  punchcut wood types? Any insight into where they would likely have been cut? (ie
  more general information about the conditions type manufacture and industry in Weimar)\r\n\r\nThanks"
