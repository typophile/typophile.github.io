  body: "Have you tried the tools already in the software?\r\nQuark 6 (and others)
    has a table creator and Illustrator (for a long time) has a graph creator built
    in. The Quark one has a 'crosshatch' icon on the tool menu below the picture box
    icon. Illustrator has a graph icon also in the tool menu.\r\nIt is possible to
    control style and font for both once you have created a master/style sheets.\r\nTim"

  body: Personally I tend to paste graphs from Excel to Illustrator and tidy them
    up there. I am still stuck on Quark 4.11 so have to do tables using fiddly text
    box, tab and rules tweaking...

    create a master in Illustrator and update the data section applying colour pallette
    and styles automatically.\r\nTim\r\n{edit anyone tried the beta version of Quark
    7?}"
