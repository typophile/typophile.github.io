  body: "Hi Don, Thanks for your answer.\r\nThe organ is rather old (more than 1 century),
    but the labels have been remade (with this typo) between 1950 and 2000. Any idea
    of which font is it ?"

  body: I know that's far from it, not even being helpful actually but it reminds
    me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/radiant|Radiant]], some sort of "Radiant
    Serif"...

  body: "<strong>Impressive</strong> (more probably ImpressiveHeavy) from SoftMaker
    (1995) looks like a perfect match if you exclude the '16' numerals. \r\nAs SoftMaker
    is a well known font forgery company, I doubt this is an original design and I
    mentioned it just in case somebody can find a more legitimate source of it."

  body: bejj, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. "Radiant Serif" doesn't exist at
    all. I just wanted to say this font reminded me of Radiant but with serifs, as
    a "Radiant Serif" would have existed.

  body: "Your software is indeed \"impressive.\" \r\nSoftmaker's font dates from 1995.
    Unless the piano labels are more recent, I suggest they were made from a font
    produced by a photo lettering company. They had very creative people who could
    use pre-digital editing techniques to completely transform font faces. I have
    no idea of the source used to make this design. Looks sort of like a Frankenstein
    of one or more fonts that started with ball terminals and underwent some slicing.
    \r\nAs for the font name, \"Impressive\" is as good as any, since we have no idea
    as to whether this is a Softmaker rip of the work of another font maker or something
    they did themselves or who produced the photo lettering version. As you mention
    the Softmaker font differs on the numerals 1 & 6. It also lacks a 2/3. A strong
    argument that the Softmaker font is not the source of the labels, but is rather
    a font produced from the same origin as the labels. \r\nDon"
