  for my friend's band. They are called Intakt(Intact) and plays some sort of indiepop/rock.\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface is Trade Gothic Bold with some changes to it. I would like to keep it simple
  and clean.\r\n\r\nDo you see any obvious misstakes that i havn't thougt of?\r\n\r\nWould
  you change anything in the current logotype?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nOskar"

  body: I agree. The A stands out too much. Move the INT and KT much closer. Then
    you'll need to decide if the space between the I and N is still alright. I think
    it might be.

  body: "Does the band have good sense of humour?  If yes, then U cld create 'a missing
    link' and in that way make a visual and 'brain' link to the meaning of the word
    Intakt... that it's not intakt! this will make it memorable and unique. \r\nAnd
    yes, Scandinavia is too minimalistic too often... and that comes from a Dane in
    Uk  : ) "
