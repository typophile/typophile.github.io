  appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm looking for resources for any vintage fonts similar
  to what is shown below (workwear, trades, construction, union made, craftsmanship,
  tools, etc).\r\n\r\nThere are several here so assistance with any would be great!\r\n\r\nUNIONMADE,

    other type is too small to positively ID, by may be Wearetrippin Display:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/wearetrippin/display/\r\n\r\n2.\r\nAgain,
    awfully small and low-res sample. |SOLID| resembles Haymaker, though not an exact
    match to the |S|:\r\nhttp://www.losttype.com/font/?name=haymaker\r\n\r\n|HANDMADE|
    etc. could be one of these:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/penumbra/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/hypatia-sans-pro/\r\n\r\nSomething
    from Harold's Monograms may help you recreate|BAT| and |MFG|:\r\nhttp://haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/harolds-monograms/\r\n\r\n3.\r\n|CARUSO|
    appears to be Corki Tuscan:\r\nhttp://www.typedepot.com/corki\r\n\r\n|Since 1978|
    appears to be the free Google web font Damion:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Damion\r\n\r\nRest
    of the type may be another Google font, PT Sans:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans\r\n\r\n4.\r\nToo
    low res.\r\n\r\n5.\r\nThe sans serif small type appears to be Neutraface 2 Condensed
    Bold:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2\r\n\r\n|SACKWEAR| shares its
    inspiration with Corki Tuscan above, and is likely custom. Found only one vaguely
    similar:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/combustion-brk.font?text=SACKWEAR"
