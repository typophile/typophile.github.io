  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've just begun working on a logo for a small jeweler. They gave me absolutely nothing to work off of- no existing designs or ideas of what they do or don't like. Their clientele remains fairly ambiguous as well. I'm flying blind. 

I came up with a ligature for a lettermark based on the lowercase j and m from ITC Modern No. 20. I really like the flow from the descender in the j up into the loops of the m. 

I'm unsure how I like Modern No. 20 for his name though, in the combination logo. 

Opinions?</div>

<strong>EileenB:</strong> Oh - I have. There's a lot of sans and scripts out there. I'd like to set Jason apart a little. When I said that "I'm flying blind" in my first post, I meant that I couldn't get much information from my client regarding their specific target market.

I like the lettermak, but I'm not too confident in the appearance of his name. Are the contrasts in the thick and thin strokes too extreme in Modern No. 20 for small letters?

		<div class="commentbody">This is progressing nicely. A few tweaks: The loop from the "m" is at too sharp an angle, it should have a smoother flow. Go back and look at Weeman's and bobbybobo's samples. I prefer your second posting (2:32pm) perhaps it's my monitor but on the earlier version the type is breaking apart. Are there any quality problems when you actually print the file?  Also the tighter kern works better for me with the "jm" ligature.  Have you tried aligning the baseline of "markesteyn" to the baseline of the "m"?  the name seems to be just floating there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You've got some kerning issues with both the ligature and the name. 

The space within the ligature should be tighter. That might also solve the "jim" problem.

The kerning within the name is not balanced at all. You need to go through and even the spaces between letters. For example, the "j" and "n" in jason are too far from the "aso". And the "r" in markesteyn is too far from the "k". I'm also wondering what this would look like with a sans-serif font for the name. Might be worth a look.

Good progress on this so far.

Interesting negative spaces appear. I love it.

I don't think the rest of the name needs a fancy placement.

Just straight foreward.

It is fancy, could be for a fashion label. But jewelry. Not quit.

		<div class="commentbody">I still don't like the arc. I'd move the top of the arc even more to the right and also not ending it at perfect vertical angle with "m". I'd make it go a bit to the right and then ending on top of "m". But not too much to still make it look visually right from the top of "m". Check the "item" where the ligature arc also goes a bit more to the right as expected, but visually it looks perfectly round and nice.

The wrong arc also makes the left stem of the "m" much higher then the rest of the letter so it becomes unbalanced.

Otherwise: very nice job and interesting ligature.

I think you could do the jeweler's name in a really clean typeface, possibly with engraving roots, such as AT Sackers Gothic, Blair, etc.
With the mark being quite decorative, the name doesn't need to fight for attention. 
Set in Modern 20 the serifs in the name may also suffer when reduced to a small size, or when foilstamped on a jewelry box etc. 
Good luck!</div>

Beside that the letters seems to small for small print.

Perhaps the mark could fit in another form to get a more juwelry-feel.
