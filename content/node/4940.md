    Sans or Sebastian.

  body: Good call! Legacy almost feels like Gill &#40;another sans i was toying with
    but didn&#39;t thing was quite right&#41; with the quirks ironed out. It feels,
    too, like Optima but more in line with the flavor of Californian. Thnx for yer
    help guys!

    between the Agfa and E&amp;F versions?

  body: I think the main differences are in naming schemes rather than <BR>quality
    or design. So I&#39;d go with the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdisplay&amp;displayfontid=ITC.9268.0.0&amp;packagefontid=0&amp;view=package&amp;searchID=0&amp;searchby=keyword&amp;searchletter=A&amp;searchstr=legacy&amp;totalrecords=117&amp;startrow=1&amp;records=20&amp;currpage=1"
    target="_blank">ITC</a> or Agfa packages which <BR>are much cheaper at $79. <BR>
    <BR>Buy from FontShop for the best support.

  body: Yes. Good question. What were you saying Miss Tiffany? Uhmm. Let&#39;s see.
    Legacy Sans is too friendly for Californian. IMO. I shoulda just said that to
    begin with. It seems to call too much attention to itself. Californian is very
    beautiful, but I think it needs a sans that contrast with it more.

  body: 'Maybe using the word elegant was too easy. Elegant is Bickham script. For
    a serif &#40;so-called&#41; bookface, Californian is pretty elegant. But it is
    also not un-friendly. I simply think that it needs something with no &#40;or hardly
    any&#41; contrast. Sorry. I took this thought home with me last night. The most
    important thing to think about is that this represents you and your own style,
    not mine. Tell us what you think about these pairings. It doesn&#39;t do you &#40;or
    me&#41; any good to simply accept what I show you. &#40;and besides it could be
    a good conversation&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have the black weight of scala
    so I don&#39;t know. A few other ideas below:  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36903.gif"

  body: <i> The most important thing to think about is that this represents you and
    your own style</i> <BR>very true. i think i&#39;m overanalyzing now and so it&#39;s
    all starting to feel irrelevant.  <BR>Personaly I think Legacy is a good match
    for Californaian, but i&#39;d agree a bit too friendly and maybe more humanistic
    feeling than i want for a resume.  <BR>Originally I was thinking Gill caps, and
    tho i love Gill, i think it&#39;s a bit too quirky again for a resume. <BR>Now
    i&#39;m thinking Scala Sans Bold SC. I&#39;ll agree that for my purposes i want
    something with a very small amount of modulation. So before i commit... any other
    ideas to consider? <BR>;^&#41; <BR>

  body: I think what these samples show is that most of these sans work <BR>well with
    Californian. What changes with your selection is the  <BR>overall feeling of the
    document. So really, it comes down to what  <BR>attitude Paul wants to portray.
    If it&#39;s &#34;classy yet comfy&#34; I still  <BR>think Legacy fills the bill.
    But so does Scala and Meta.

  body: I&#39;m so happy that Franklin Gothic was suggested. I have a fondness for
    it that goes beyond any natural state. Grew accustomed to  Franklin as a reliable
    plowhorse and have never outgrown the love of it. <BR> <BR>I would also like to
    see it paired with other versions of &#34;Californian&#34;. Lanston has the face
    in the works from his patterns as you all now know from another thread. <BR> <BR>Good
    on ya, Tiffany! <BR> <BR>jim Rimmer

  body: Nearly any plain-spoken and sober, bold-sans  would pair well with ITC Berkley
    or Californian. <BR>I thought Franklin Gothic was a good, compatable suggestion.
    Try Spartan or Futura bold, too. <BR>I also like Penumbra MM for the job. You
    can go with a plain sans &#40;725 BD 0 SA&#41; or with a subtle spur serif &#40;725
    BD 150 FS&#41;.

    complete lack of pretension played well against the slightly ornate Californian.
