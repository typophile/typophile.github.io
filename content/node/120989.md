  business card. When I clicked on the Pinterest link for this image, it brought me
  to a screenshot page with little to no info on this design. \r\nhttp://www.webpagescreenshot.info/img/52c507890bd0a3-29791074\r\n\r\nHere's
  the Pinterest pin address: http://www.pinterest.com/pin/376472850075121040/\r\n\r\nI
  also tried looking up the website listed on the business card, but the site (www.kodansha.co.jp)
  is branded differently, and does not appear to be the same company.\r\n\r\nI've
  also tried looking on about 10 different font sites (myfonts, fontshop, linotype,
  commercial, dutch type, playtype, font squirrel, lost type, village, veer, etc.)
  and have not spotted it. I tried WhatTheFont, and that did not pull up the correct
  font. I've become obsessed. Thanks for any help you can provide.\r\n\r\nElise[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KODANSHA_Japanese_logo-ID_typeface_4138.png]"

    mainly by the somewhat clumsy |S| (too symmetrical), and that it\u2019s used only
    for the logo, I would say it\u2019s a custom job, not a typeface (or, if it\u2019s
    indeed a typeface, it\u2019s most probably from a Japanese foundry)."

    some sort of (manually?) contrasted version of it but /S still off. This /S is
    definitely bothering me, its apparent clumsiness lets me think it could have been
    borrowed to a different font or maybe the contrasting process worked bad on this
    one. It reminds me also some [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/egyptian|Egyptian]]

    this is a Kenya Hara design, and riccard0 pointed me to Hara's website. Judging
    by the captions on the Hara website, it looks like his design team created this
    font for KODANSHA, so I'm not sure it would be available to me.\r\n\r\nI'll go
    through the suggested alternatives and let you know my pick.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    But on balance, for a substitute I would go with Melior, a creation of one of
    the master font designers, Hermann Zapf, which has spawned many imitations of
    its \"super ellipse\" design. To duplicate the logo, the edits of Melior would
    not be major.\r\ndon"
