body: Dave McKean work as an illustrator is simply amazing and was one of the first
  references I had on design &#40;as a music layout designer&#41;. I suppose most
  of his typographic work is custom &#40;see big image below&#41; altough he used
  alot of emigre &amp; virus fonts. Does anyone recognize the SANDMAN type? <BR> <BR><img
  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24803.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Also
  regarding his caligraphic/type destruction, does anyone recognizes some of the fonts
  he used on this work below? Anyone know any simmilar type works like this?  <BR><img

    almost all smaller metal bands layouts&#41; that I consider to have a huge McKean

  body: McKean&#39;s own studio&#39;s Hourglass film is a mixture of brush hand-lettering
    &#40;for which you could help yourself using Contrivance or Stroke, as suggested,
    but doing it by hand it&#39;s always best&#41;, and my own Ottomat Bold, from
    Emigre &#40;pride, pride!&#41; <BR>Dave even used the Italic of Ottomat when I
    released it around 1996 for the Death mini-series hardcover &#40;1st edition&#41;
    and in other personal corporate stuff &#40;I&#39;ve seen it in a book of graphic
    design work. <BR>Recently, however, he mostly used customized versions of Jonathan&#39;s
    Virus faces, as Yves pointed out. <BR>I tried to contact him a pair of times,
    but it&#39;s difficult. To think I sat right near him in an old comic convention
    in Lucca, way before I released typefaces...

  body: 'McKean did a lot of CD album covers for many indie bands, but I never bought
    CDs just for the artwork. Well... I did, for Vaughan Oliver&#39;s Pixies albums,
    the recent Tool album Lateralus, some Rammstein albums, but if the music does
    not click I have to be really motivated to buy a CD for the design. <BR> <BR>I
    bought Barbie Rapunzel DVD used anyway, while collecting Emigre-related fonts
    recefences. It&#39;s the most weird use of Manson I&#39;ve seen up to date &#40;together
    with the Snow White customized version&#41;. <BR> <BR>P.S. Brian, while Hadrian
    and Unzialis are not so ugly, they are second generation paste-up stuff, not to
    be compared to early Jonathan and Miles great work... <BR>I think if McKean realizes
    what Jon&#39;s collaborator Marcus McCallion is doing with his own Undt type foundry,
    he&#39;ll have new toys to play with. <BR>I&#39;m especially fond of Pukka, Priceless
    and Prey for Satan. <BR>Go here: <BR><a href="http://www.undt.co.uk/undt.html"
