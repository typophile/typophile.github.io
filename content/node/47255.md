    incorporate the 'RF' from directly below (left) over it.\r\n\r\nStay away from
    anything that resembles Nike's Roger Federer monogram which have been selling
    like hotcakes:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NRFFLW-big_3784.jpg]"

  body: Thanks Jayyy, the one with stripes is logo-now adding the monogram-natural
    direction was the monogram you selected. I was pushing for something more abstract
    that resembles flowers but classic may be best. Thanks for the Federer reference,
    it's great.
