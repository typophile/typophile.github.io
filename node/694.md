body: Well, TypeCon got me all fired up, so &#40;against my nature and better judgement&#41;
  I thought I might try to start a Forum for educators to discuss their particular
  &#40;?&#41; brand of problems. Maybe an &#34;Idea Clearinghouse&#34; of sorts. At
  my school, most discussions degenerate into b!tch sessions at an amazing speed.
  Hopefully this will be different, but perhaps there could be a special &#34;Screaming
  into the Void&#34; thread. All &#40;including non-teachers&#41; are welcome, of
  course. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure how many of you typophiles actually <i>are</i>
  teachers - but I was surprised for some reason to realize how many folks at TypeCon
  were educators. So perhaps this forum has legs. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m fairly new at teaching
  - I&#39;ve been at it for about 5 years now. I never had a formal design education
  myself. I went to grad school to study  painting and linguistics; that, coupled
  with having run printing presses for several years, engendered my interest in typography
  I suppose. So here I am. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m probably not the best person to start
  or moderate a forum since I&#39;m usually in the classroom or in unbearably stupefying
  meetings, but I look forward to talking to whoever may be interested. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
  <BR> <BR>Nathan

  body: 'nathan--thanks for starting this forum. i think it could be a great asset
    and collaborative tool. i was also at typecon, but unfortunately had to leave
    before the education discussion. i&#39;m very sorry to have missed that.  <BR>
    <BR>i guess i have two questions: <BR> <BR>1. what was covered in the education
    panel at typecon? <BR> <BR>2. what textbooks do you &#40;or anyone reading&#41;
    use for typography courses, and how do you utilize them in class?'

  body: 'Hi Tyler. I was beginning to think I was all alone out here :-P so it&#39;s
    good to hear from someone. And here&#39;s my best shot at answering your questions:
    <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; The Education Panel was good, but I was left wanting a lot
    more. Nothing against the panelists or the conference though - it was just a time
    limitation thing I&#39;m afraid. It&#39;s hard to pack much into one hour, especially
    when you want to leave time for questions. Mostly the panelists talked about projects
    they use &#40;I actually co-opted one for my beginning type students&#41; and
    showed students&#39; work. There was some discussion about the difficulties in
    teaching older or returning students, and students from disciplines outside of
    design. And about how much time people tend to spend on technical instruction
    vs. conceptual&#40;?&#41;. It was great, though, seeing what other folks were
    doing and it gave me some ideas for rewriting parts of my school&#39;s program.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; Right now we&#39;re using Carter, Day, and Meggs&#39; <i>Typographic
    Design: Form and Communication</i>. We recently switched from Martin Solomon&#39;s
    <i>Art of Typography</i>, which I hated using. I think the CDM book will work
    well, because it has a lot of good examples of student work. For the most part,
    the kids at my school have thought little, if at all, about typography. So they
    need quite a bit of visual information to get started - to even begin to think
    about letters as something with a form and a function. Most of them are here to
    be web designers or Photoshop jockeys, so getting them to care about type is no
    small feat. Getting them passionate is next to impossible. <BR> <BR>As far as
    how we use the book: I pull most of my lectures out of the first 5 chapters &#40;Evolution
    of Typography, Anatomy of Typography, Syntax and Communication, Legibility, and  Typographic
    Technology&#41;. Chapter 6 is a nice collection of projects from instructors at
    other schools - nice to have when you realize one of your own projects is totally
    bombing :-&#41; And chapter 7 is full of case studies from the commercial design
    world - handy when your students say &#34;nobody really cares about this do they?&#34;
    since the only type they see is the closed captioning of Paradise Hotel or the
    score on Tomb Raider IV. It also has a pretty good section of specimens which
    I use when I talk about line measure, leading, word spacing, etc. <BR> <BR>I keep
    thinking about trying to use Felici as a textbook, but I&#39;m afraid my beginning
    students would be lost. The amount of diagrams and illustrations in CDM really
    lends itself well to first year kids. Currently I&#39;m trying to add some more
    type courses to our curriculum &#40;typography is the red-headed stepchild of
    my school&#41; so maybe I can bring Felici in for a couple of those.  <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR> <BR>Nathan'
