  about it...\r\n\r\nIs it possible to include an accented character in a font name?
  FontLab allows it in some name fields, but not others. This leads me to wonder if
  such a discrepancy (some name fields with the accented character, some without)
  would lead to technical problems for users. \r\n\r\nI've found at least one font
  with an accent in the name: ITC Odyss\xE9e. It appears that the accent is used only
  in the \"trade name\" as it appears in specimen books and such, not in the actual
  font name. I'm not sure if anything usefull can be deduced from this."

    i put my surname J\xFCrgen into the entry field the u-dieresis doesn\u2019t show
    up in the Microsoft related entries. And i remember once having crashed the OS
    when i loaded a generated font with an accented character. But that was years
    ago in Fontographer era. Haven\u2019t tried it again since then ;-)"

    French spelling (with proper accents) regardless of the host system's language.

    (pages 8-9).\r\n\r\nLike far too many things with OpenType at present (despite
    how many years since initial rollout?), the caveat seems to stand: Access to features/functions
    is dependent on a given user's operating system and application support.\r\n\r\nIn
    short, Mark, seems like it's a crapshoot at best. Good luck."
