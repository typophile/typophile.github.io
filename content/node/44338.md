body: "On page 75 of <em>American Metal Typefaces</em>, Mac McGrew lists \"What's
  in a font\" and includes Small Caps, and later in the list \"Typographic Refinements...
  'true-cut' small caps.\" What are these \"true-cut small caps\" as distinct from
  the small caps he's already listed?\r\n\r\n(Note that this is about metal type,
  not computer \"faux small caps\" a la Microsoft Word.)"

  body: "I'm not absolutely positive this is how McGrew uses the term, but, it has
    been possible since the metal age to trace the drawings of the Caps with a machine
    that would shrink them at different factors in x and y to make small caps, cheaply.
    This was done to give the small caps wider bodies relative to the shortened height
    and prevent them from ending up weaker than the lowercase. Today, this can be
    done by scaling the uppercase by different  factors to create small caps (\u201Cfaux
    small caps\u201D).\r\n\r\nBut these techniques do not produce the best results
    which involve handwork, either from the beginning, or after the mechanical scale.
    It is this work, correcting the diagonals, vertical serifs and more, (much more
    in an italic),  that produces what I think McGrew calls  \u2019true-cut\u2019
    small caps. Anyone know different?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    -- obviously you would know.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n<cite>This was done to give the
    small caps wider bodies relative to the shortened height and prevent them from
    ending up weaker than the lowercase.</cite> \r\n\r\nDoesn't quite work, in that
    even non-porportional scaling doesn't give the stem weight increase, so they wind
    up looking weaker anyway.\r\n\r\nYou're right about the handwork required -- I've
    had to do it too many times.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility was that with some metal
    composition, you could always use, say, 8-point full caps mixed in with 10-point
    U&lc. Leading could be a problem, but there were ways around that, too. Still,
    that's a *compositors* solution rather than a font property, so he probably didn't
    meant that. "

  body: "My guess is that McGrew was using the two terms to describe the same thing.
    & that thing is as described by David & Charles: fonts of small capitals drawn
    & then cut to blend seamlessly with both upper case and lower case sorts of the
    same face and size. Stem weights, character widths, all proportions were worked
    to make the smalls \"true-cut.\" \r\n\r\nThe term \"true-cut\" was also used by
    the Ludlow Typograph Company to describe some of its faces. I think they had a
    \"True-Cut\" Caslon and a \"True-Cut\" Bodoni. Yet another attempt by a typecasting
    company to claim their faces were closest to the \"originals.\" I'll have to look
    at my Ludlow books over the weekend to see if those faces had smalls.\r\n\r\npowers"
