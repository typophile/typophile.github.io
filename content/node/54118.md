body: "Sorry for the cross-posting but wanted to make sure that people here knew that
  the newest version of the AFDKO is now available at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\r\n\r\nPlease
  post your questions on the FontLab forum at http://forum.fontlab.com/adobe/afdko/\r\n\r\nBelow
  is a brief summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n<cite>This release finally brings
  the FDK tools fully up to par with the OpenType specification. The most notable
  new features are that the FDK now fully supports all GSUB and GPOS lookup categories,
  and can apply the feature file directives to TTF source fonts to build TTF fonts
  with OpenType layout tables. The power of the FDK command-line tools can now be
  applied to building fonts for all scripts, including complex scripts such as Arabic
  and Indic.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>AFDKO 2.5 also supports several of the newer OpenType
  features: user-friendly names for stylistic set features, and expanded lookup flag
  settings for use with mark classes. In addition, for CJK fonts, the tools now support
  Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVSes).</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>If you're someone who
  builds or tests fonts, please try it out! (Installation is now working better as
  well, and there is a command file for Windows that avoids the earlier need to edit
  environment variables). Note that the AFDKO is tools are all command-line based,
  and and require some willingness to get technical.</cite>\r\nfrom http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2009/01/afdko_25_is_rel_1.html"

    tried several times with the past version to no avail. This time it zipped through.
    Now I just have to figure out how to use it :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    any case, congratulations to the team. I've been using a pre-release of this for
    a while, and it is very nice indeed!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
