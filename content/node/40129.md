  company is quite small-time so the logo would be applied by rubber stamp on the
  packaging and stationary to further emphasis the homemade nature of the products
  they supply.\r\nI'm still unsure whether the logo or the concept is there or not
  and would appreciate some constructive criticism as to the direction it could be
  taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nSe\xE1n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The E and L need to line up better on the left side. The j is a bit bothersome
    too, it's touching things, but it doesn't really do anything for it. It's all
    a bit tight for me as well.

  body: This would be a wonderful logo if not for your goal. I'd expect to see this
    in some enormous institution like IKEA or an airline, and I'd expect them to be
    good cookies, but good cookies brought to me by a faceless megacorporation that
    makes no pretense of not being a faceless megacorporation but still wants me to
    know it cares about its millions of customers and genuinely hopes I love and enjoy
    the cookies. It's a very good design concept but if you want to emphasize "homemade"
    and "small-time" you'll want to move away from Helvetica.

  body: "I like the bitten-off 'o'. \r\n\r\nThe ampersand reversing out of the text
    seems rather distracting.\r\n\r\nWith this sort of device, I feel it's always
    better to have just one intervention.\r\n"

  body: "Ampersand is a waste of time where it is -- nice idea to use a big old cursive
    job like that though -- I'd make it much bigger and make a feature of it.  Bite
    is nice but too small -- maybe it would integrate with the new ampersand?\r\n\r\nOther
    points about general balance etc are relevant too."
