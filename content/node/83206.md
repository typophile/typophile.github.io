body: "I am working on a roadside sign and the question of text size vs. whitespace
  came up.  I am looking for some practical ideas about this topic.  The font will
  be Fontin Sans regular and bold chosen to keep with brand standards and because
  of it's large x-height and good legibility.  I added generous tracking as well,
  and the text is white on dark green.  The viewing distance will be about 30 feet,
  in a car traveling maybe 35 miles per hour in town.  I am using title case and someone
  suggested that the <strong>x-height</strong> (rather than cap height) should be
  the 3 inches from charts such as this:\r\nhttp://www.elliott-design.net/letter_size_chart.htm\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I want to balance letter size with some other factors to keep readability and good
  layout considerations.  In other words, how much do the following specifically enhance
  readability in this context, and how can good design principles be balanced with
  the desire to maximize letter size.\r\n\r\n- Generous whitespace around the text.
  \ Letter size could go up if whitespace is given up.\r\n\r\n- Using title case instead
  of all uppercase.  Measured letter size would be increased by simply using all caps.\r\n\r\n-
  Things like hierarchy, additional tracking and well designed layout make maximizing
  text size impossible.  I have already eliminated as much text as possible, and tried
  to simplify things, but the lower case is around 2.5 inches, or maybe even a bit
  less.\r\n\r\nComments, thoughts and musings welcome."

    spacing: depends on the viewing distance. It\u2019s the same principle as making
    the tracking in small print sizes larger. You want to make the space between the
    letters so, that at the largest possible viewing distance, letters can still be
    easily differentiated.  \r\n\r\nCase: What do you mean by \xBBtitle case\xAB?\r\nIn
    general you would want to use mixed case and uppercase/small caps only for VERY
    short pieces of information. \r\n\r\nHierarchy: Would depend on your design. Do
    you have some screenshots?\r\nMy personal experience with road signs: Hierarchies
    are best displayed thru position/spacing and color inlays. All those different
    font styles and sizes we use in print create too much distraction on a road sign.

    to test. Of course this may be impractical if the sign is huge, but for a smaller
    sign it's often possible, or you can at least mockup a few words from the sign
    in actual size. Then hang it up and drive by in your car and see how readable
    it really is.\r\n\r\nAt a design firm I worked for we needed to create a sign
    to place in front of a client's office. We projected an image of our layout onto
    a big piece of white cardboard and drew it using markers, then hung the cardboard
    where the sign would go and drove by. We discovered the type was way too small.
    Saved us a lot of money and embarassment to find out before the final sign was
    fabricated."

    goals are you addressing by suggesting making things larger?  Maybe if you could
    describe the problem you see so that I can come to my own conclusions about the
    solution?\r\n\r\nIn general these are the questions I have:\r\n\r\n- In these
    height charts, is the text size measured by cap height or x-height?  Given that
    lower case letters are shorter, does that mean that text set in all caps will
    be more readable from a distance than lowercase of the same point size?  (I assumed
    the opposite)\r\n\r\n- What strategies do you use in balancing text size, tracking
    and whitespace to preserve readability while maintaining asthetic quality?\r\n\r\n-
    Since it is easy to use these charts to be rigid about measured letter height
    minimums, how do you navigate and communicate the wholistic approach of incorporating
    ideas about whitespace, tracking, font selection, etc. instead of focusing solely
    on measured size of the smallest letters?"

    35 mph. A car traveling at 35 mph travels 51 feet per second. So the sign will
    be visible for less than **one second**.\r\n\r\nEven if we assume they're traveling
    slower, or can see if from a greater distance, we're still only talking about
    enough time for a very quick glance. So readability is a high priority, and it
    looked like the type & logo could be made considerably larger without making it
    look crowded.\r\n\r\nHere's a quickie example. I made the type bigger, eliminated
    the phone, and centered the type on the right (since the type on the left is centered).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign_4764.jpg]\r\n\r\n>
    the phone number was requested \r\n\r\nIf this sign will only be readable for
    a second or two while someone is driving by, you need to convince them that a
    phone number is a bad idea, and even potentially dangerous if someone tries to
    copy it down while driving.\r\n"

  body: "JamesM, thanks for your comments.  I should have explained a bit more that
    30 feet is very roughly the minimum viewing distance as one drives by, rather
    than the span of road from which the sign is visible.  I would estimate that the
    sign is visible for more than 200-300 feet as you drive toward it, and from looking
    at charts, getting clearly readable to most people at 150-100 feet.  That would
    give a viewing time of 4-6 seconds, and a reading time of 2-3 seconds, which is
    actually quite a long while for such few words in my opinion.  Let's say perfectly
    adequate for communicating the main message of wayfinding and awareness, don't
    you agree?\r\nI was reluctant to post the screen shot because I am not really
    looking for ways to toss out whitespace in favor of larger text as you handily
    achieved, but rather to understand the underlying principles and gain a better
    understanding of how to approach that balance.  Unfortunately, you didn't give
    me enough insight into your thinking behind the changes you made, so I wasn't
    able to appreciate your motivation and goals.  To be clear, I am not looking for
    ways to make the text larger** - the scale tool is easy enough to operate.  Rather
    I was looking for insight and others' perspective on the relative importance of
    factors other than text size, and also whether to interpret the charts as x-height
    or cap height.   Yes, fairly abstract and theoretical, but I pegged you lot as
    a heady group, and hoped to learn something.  Looking at Ralf's blog and Clearview
    gothic has been very interesting!  Thanks for those links.  The idea of a mockup
    is spot on, I will try it out.  I did some tests on screen standing across the
    room, but printouts would definitely help make it more realistic.  \r\n\r\n**My
    comments about \"the desire to maximize letter size\" were admittedly a bit misleading.
    \ Those were not my desires, but rather other folks involved in the project, who
    do have some experience in signage.\r\n\r\n-edit-\r\nRussel, I posted only to
    see your previous post.  Additional signs are out of the question I think.  Putting
    one there would mean that it is in a front yard of a home, since it is all residential
    in the area.  \r\nThis sign will not be on the corner, so I hope that people will
    understand to turn-as-soon-as-you-can at the end of this block.  Is that really
    confusing?  I often see billboards on the highway that say \"next exit\".  Even
    if they successfully make that right, they will not see the building unless they
    take the right onto reed st.  It really is just around the block, but without
    2 turns you would miss it.  I tried to add a bit of an arrow feel to the green
    background shape, but I can see how it's a bit more subtle on this background
    than on an actual sign."

    \r\n\r\n> Unfortunately, you didn't give me enough insight into \r\n> your thinking

    just made the type easier to read from a moving car by reducing the number of
    words and making the type bigger. :)   \r\n\r\nThe centering wasn't for readability,
    though, it was just a judgement call that if your logo uses centered type then
    it's more consistent to use centered type on the right side, too, rather than
    having mixed alignments.\r\n\r\nBut the only way to really find out the best size
    for the type is to make a mockup, put it in the actual location, and have some
    friends view it from a moving car. Perhaps your current type size will be fine.
    But my gut instinct is that making the type larger (like in my mockup) will make
    it easier to read. And if a sign can't be read, it can't communicate the intended
    message."

    \ \r\n\r\nArea of Sign / Computation Process: \r\n1. Determine speed of travel

    Determine Single Letter Area in square feet: Single Letter Area in square \r\ninches/144.
    \r\n7. Determine Copy Area (Single Letter Area in square feet x total number of
