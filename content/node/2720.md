body: I&#39;m trying to locate a commercially available typeface approximating the
  look of a Bodoni or Didot Sans. I&#39;m aware of Peter Bilak&#39;s unpublished Didot
  Sans, but have yet to find anything that captures the same spirit. I&#39;ve located
  numerous, Deco-styled faces that have the thick/thin qualities of a Didot, but the
  contrast is typically too exaggerated and the proportions too condensed. <BR> <BR>Creating
  a new face isn&#39;t an option as the budget on the job does not allow for the time
  needed to do so... <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of any typefaces out there that preserve
  the classic proportions of a Didot, minus it&#39;s serifs? Any assisitance would
  be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: 'If I remember rightly, I have read that the original 19th century &#39;Grotesques&#39;
    are in fact based on &#39;modern&#39; proportions such as Didot and Bodoni. The
    progression was first to thick unbracketed serifs of &#39;Egyptians&#39;, and
    then these had the serifs cut off &amp; voila. '

  body: 'Britannic has always struck me as being one of the most successful high-contrast
    sans serif faces. <BR>However, it has the full curves of a grotesque, not the
    more geometric, neoclassical shapes of Bodoni-era &#34;moderns&#34;.  <BR> <BR>The
    over-extension and turning back of the curved terminals in &#34;c&#34;, for instance,
    provide the opportunity for a purposeful end to the stroke, not just snipping
    it off, which would be the minimal, pure-didone logic. <BR> <BR>So, it would make
    a good pairing not with the original moderns, but with more contemporary &#40;ie
    c.1900&#41; moderns such as, ahem, Monotype Modern 2, or De Vinne. <BR> <BR>For
    a 3some, add Grot. #9. <BR> <BR>If in doubt for matching faces, make them from
    the same era.'
