		<div class="commentbody">Tim is right. As long as you have a decent relationship with your printer, they'll usually do multiple versions of cards on a sheet. It doesn't take any extra work on their part, other than making sure they set the different versions in pre-press. All of the printers I use have at least 4-up on a sheet for a 2-sided card (8 up divided by 2 sides). That means you should be able to have 4 versions. Even if you don't have an existing relationship with your printer, if you understand the process and if they know that you understand the process, it is difficult for them to justify charging much, if anything, for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott</div>
