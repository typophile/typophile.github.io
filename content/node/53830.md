body: Would need help to identify these two elegant serifs and particularly the second
  one ("KLARICA") with this so distinctive R. Thanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_6111.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_3627.jpg]

    from H&FJ</a>. Don\u2019t know about the \u2018R\u2019 with the straight leg,
    tho."

  body: Thanks a lot Jan for taking time to look at it. That's actually my first information
    for it (as said in the main title). Final lower serif of the L and low horizontal
    stroke of the A are also very specific. Would really like to know what (base?)
    font it could be(part of Requiem)...

  body: "Sorry. Didn\u2019t read your title properly. I agree that \u2018Klarica\u2019
    seems to differ from Requiem. But the rest is pretty close. Even the hyphen."

  body: I swear I've seen something similar..the K and R of the "Klarica" just can't
    place it.
