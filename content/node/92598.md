  body: The text face is too small for me, but the heading is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/versus-twin/bipolar-decorative">Bipolar
    Decorative</a>.

  body: "I looked at the text face again. Could it be Underware\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/fonts/fakir/\">Fakir</a>
    (Regular)?"

  body: Thanks! I think the body is from the Bipolar family (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/versus-twin/bipolar/)
    as well. Thanks for the help!

  body: "\u2018YOU\u2019VE WON\u2019 is probably Bipolar, indeed. I\u2019m pretty
    convinced, however, that the small text is set in Fakir. Bipolar doesn\u2019t
    even have a three-storey \u2018g\u2019. And try to compare some distinctive characters
    like \u2018C\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018A\u2019, \u2018w\u2019 or \u2018y\u2019.
    As I said, it\u2019s difficult to tell at that size, but Fakir seems close at
    least."
