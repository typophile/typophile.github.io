body: "The Government of the Republic of Armenia allows it's official fonts to be
  used for commercial purposes by anyone (except of selling them directly). The fonts
  are [[http://www.granshan.org/works/2008/mrcuyt_mariam.pdf|GHEA Mariam]] and [[http://www.granshan.org/works/2008/mrcuyt_grapalat.pdf|GHEA
  Grapalat]]. Both fonts were designed by Edik Gabuzyan \u2013 corrections were made
  to GHEA Mariam's Latin, Cyrillic and Greek types by Robert Slimbach. Download them
  from [[ http://www.gov.am/u_files/file/fonts.zip|here]].\r\n\r\nAny other government
  as generous as the Armenian? What are your opinions on commercial use of these kind
  of works?"

  body: "The governments of India and Pakistan, for example, have developed a number
    of free fonts. In the case of India, it's because the country has a number of
    different scripts, many of which, due to the country's relative poverty, are not
    economically important enough to encourage software developers to commission fonts
    for them. In the case of Pakistan, it's because Urdu is typically written in a
    particular style of the Arabic script, Nasta'liq, that poses a technical challenge
    not forced upon designers in the Naskh style. (Naskh, properly done, doesn't have
    a fixed baseline like Latin <em>either</em>, but since it is horizontal most of
    the time instead of diagonal, it can be debased by fudging away the occasions
    when the baseline should shift upwards within a word.)\r\n\r\nNote that the foregoing
    is a drastic oversimplification of topics that, if one is interested, have been
    discussed at length in threads here from which I learned of these facts.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it comes to Armenian fonts, what annoys me is that there are plenty of free Armenian
    fonts both Unicode and ArmSCII, but there doesn't seem to be a single free Bolorgir
    font in Unicode! Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised those who favor a conservative
    typeface style are also conservative in their coding choices."

    far as I can see there's no license and no readme associated with this package.
    As such I wouldn't expect any professional entity would be willing to build dependencies
    on these fonts. Where's the license?\r\n "

  body: "Couldn't find the license on that site. But I found [[http://www.granshan.org/index.php?lang=eng&mode=alphabet|this]]
    and even though the alphabet shown in black was Armenian (the Latin letters in
    orange seem to be in a different face) I immediately recognized the typeface as
    one I'd seen before (i.e. in an ICL 1900 manual)... it's Monotype Grotesque.\r\n\r\nWell,
    <em>maybe</em> it's actually trying to be Arial or even Akzidenz Grotesk - as
    my powers of font recognition are, I must admit, limited compared to those of
    the experts.\r\n\r\n(I'm now starting to think that although I identify the typeface
    very strongly with Britain, it indeed is Akzidenz Grotesk; and I've just learned
    that not only was that face known as \"Standard\" in the U.S., but that it was
    known as \"Basic Commercial\" in Britain.)"

  body: AFAIK The Russian government has done something quite similar with PT Sans
    and PT serif, so both fonts can include all the minority languages of the Russian
    Federation (instead of including 'only' the most popular ones, as most commercial
    fonts do).

  body: "There isn't a license, the government website only mentions about the acquisition
    of the fonts. On facebook Mr. Gabuzyan confirmed that the fonts are available
    for download by anyone. The only logical restriction which he mentions about is
    that \u2018neither the appearance of the characters nor the copyright data can
    be changed\u2019. However one [[http://www.hayeren.am/?p=fonts|website]] which
    distributes [[http://www.gov.am/u_files/file/fonts.zip|these]] and other two fonts
    mentions that the fonts can be used for non-profit purposes only."
