  and instructions. I'm not dissatisfied with how it looks, but I'm working on some
  new catalogs, and I'm curious if anyone has any recommendations for a suitable replacement
  that might be a little more exciting.\r\n\r\nI've got a lot of data in various charts,
  so it would have to be a pretty narrow typeface. News Gothic Condensed and Myriad
  Condensed are both narrower, but I'd rather stick with Helvetica. There are a bunch
  of other typefaces that would work, but they're so close to Helvetica Neue Condensed
  that it wouldn't make sense to switch. \r\n\r\nFF Unit looks like it could work,
  even though it's definitely wider than Helvetica Neue Condensed, but I'm wondering
  if there's anything a bit narrower.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"
