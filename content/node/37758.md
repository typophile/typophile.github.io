body: "Dear friends,\r\n\r\nBoldoni is like a caricature: it brings with itself exaggerated
  elements of the modern typefaces, that has as main names Giambattista Bodoni and
  Fran\xE7ois-Ambroise Didot. Boldoni takes to the egde its width and serifs, causing
  a ultrafat type feeling, and its styles causes a monochromatic effect that remember
  the colors Black, Gray and White. Some of uses are titles, initials, drop caps,
  lettering, posters and vertical writing.\r\n\r\nYou can see it on pdf attached and
  T26 site,\r\n\r\n[[http://www.t26.com/fonts/Boldoni|http://www.t26.com/fonts/Boldoni]]\r\n\r\nComments
  are welcome!\r\n\r\nJarbas Gomes\r\n[[http://www.fortetype.com|ForteType.com]]\r\n--\r\n"
