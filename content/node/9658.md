  body: It&#39;s the El Greco-based font called &#34;Calligraphy&#34; from Casaday
    &amp; Greene &#40;now defunct&#41;. There is an alternative known as Daniela.
    The only letter that differs from El Greco is the A, but that&#39;s enough to
    throw many searches astray.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66908.gif"
