    think we know the answer to that. One of the letters in each of them will look
    funny.\r\n\r\nHowever I went to www.onlliinnee.net, and I couldn't find anything
    about model railroading there, it was just the page about the operating system.\r\n\r\nI
    wasn't interested in installing that, but I would have been curious about the
    startup home page which the operating system would have."
