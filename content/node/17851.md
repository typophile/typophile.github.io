body: "I have a client that claims to have seen a typeface in which the Caps and Lowercase
  were interchangeable. Meaning the overall character height is the same. Of course
  changing type size is an option but she recalls the weight of the letterforms was
  the same. ie. an uppercase T was equal in size and weight to the lowercase e.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of any examples of such a face? \r\n\r\n"

      On book covers all over europe, there seems to be no escape\u2026 And not a
      sans, but filisofia unicase isn't a sans either\u2026"
