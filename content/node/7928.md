  body: Doesn&#39;t look like Georgia at all.  Looks like Times New Roman to me, but
    the T seems slightly off.  Truthfully, it resembles many fonts.  If only it the
    text size were larger.

    I am recreating the logo to use on the workbook covers for our sales team.  <BR>here
    is a clip art from one of the links from that site, the font appears fatter in
    this image, i wonder if they are the same fonts. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/54791.gif"

  body: The &#34;TUDOR VENTURES&#34; could simply be a bold version of the same font.  And
    I don&#39;t think the original font is TNR either upon closer inspection.  The
    T is a wide as it&#39;s tall.  TNR&#39;s T doesn&#39;t have those dimensions.

    target="_blank">Times Bold</a> &#40;or Times New Roman Bold, if you like&#41;.
    The first sample is some version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-no2-t/regular/testdrive.html?s=TUDOR&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Baskerville</a>, though it&#39;s hard to say exactly which one,
    there are so many.
