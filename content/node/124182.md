body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is a project I'm planning to do, a latin/javanese
  typeface family. I don't really know how to label this really, it has thick/thin
  stroke but without spurs (which is how serif in Javanese script would look like).
  I guess it's a humanist sans? Anyway, it's my first latin font, I usually only do
  the Javanese, and any comment/feedback is greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aturra

  so apologies for any mistakes[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aturra sample2_4711.jpg]"

  body: "You're doing well so far.\r\n\r\nt: It would be helpful for the crossbar
    to be at the x-height and extend right a little longer.\r\n\r\nf: It is not too
    unusual for the crossbar to be lower than the x-height, nor too unusual for the
    ascender to be shorter than the others, but both at the same time gives the impression
    that the whole f has been scaled down to a smaller type size.\r\n\r\nItalic h/k:
    The first leg is bent inward and the second leg straight. I see that you may intend
    to relate it to the Javanese this way, but this is strange and distracting for
    Latin reading. Normal italics have the first leg straight (because in handwriting
    it is where the pen sharply returns upward), and if there is a bend it is on the
    last leg. (But l is good and its difference from i is smart.)\r\n\r\nItalic v/w/x:
    Not enough slant. Consider adding something interesting to the ends of the downstroke
    of italic x.\r\nItalic z: Maybe too much slant. Consider a reversed stress similar
    to 2/5/7.\r\n\r\nAll s/S curves are going to need some fine-tuning. I can tell
    from your finished g that you'll get there on your own."

  body: "Thank you, yes to all that feedback. Working on it.\r\n\r\nBut honestly,
    I have no idea how to fine-tune the s/S. The terminals in particular really confuses
    me. It's like deleting the spur from a serif font, which make the terminals too
    hairline. The only similar reference I have is Sakkal Majalla, where the terminals
    are flat and slightly thicken. Any ideas?"

  body: "In a contrasted of \u201Cstressed\u201D sans, to balance |S| and |s|, one
    can\u2019t simply use the shape of a serif |S| and remove the serifs (a textbook
    example of this mistake is Bodoni Sans http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/greyscale-type/bodoni-sans/
    in which an otherwise perfectly good typeface is ruined by a backward leaning
    |S|).\r\nAs for terminals, they usually have the same shape of the ones on |C|c|,
    either thickened (example: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/britannic/) or tapered
    (example: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carisma/). However, the thickening
    can be very subtle (examples: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot/ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/reserves/vanitas/).\r\nIn
    your case, though, I think the problem isn\u2019t much with terminals, but more
    on the bottom counter, which looks somewhat \u201Cweak\u201D compared to the upper
    one."

    is it necessary then for this font to have ligatures, since the hook is short?
    Perhaps only ff with connected crossbars is necessary. Other similar fonts has
    slightly rounded hook, prompting the nedd for ligatures, while this is flat."

    Thank you very much for the advice. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/aturra
    sample3_3645.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe other thing I'd like to ask is the harmony between
    the latin and javanese. I absolutely love the Javanese, I think it's perfect.
    Looking it side by side with latin though, I think its a bit crowded and heavier.
    Should this be addressed, or is it still tolerable due to difference in writing
    system? I tried looking samples of roman/indic font harmony in Thai fonts, but
    Javanese is very particular. The characters are inherently heavier I guess [img:sites/default/files/old-images/aturra

  body: "I don't think that the Javanese looks darker, rather more contrasted (and
    obviously more \"blocky\").\r\nOverall, to me it looks more \"didone\"/Melior
    than its Latin counterpart."

  body: Once you are satisfied with the forms, you will have to work on letter spacing,
    and over all I think it can be made rather tighter, which will eliminate the difference
    you are concerned about, to the extent that the remaining difference in look can
    only be expected. I don't know anything about Javanese, but I assume that when
    the two scripts are set together, the stroke weights will be the same, with the
    Latin body larger than that of the Javanese because it doesn't need so much space
    above and below.

  body: "@riccardo I did thought to make the latin more didot, but then I'd prefer
    Aturra to be more of a body-type. I planned to do didot for my other display-type

    yeah, I haven't touch the kerning whatsoever. I'll get to it soon.\r\nThe stroke
    weight is almost same when the characters are put side by side, but because the
    shape of Javanese is inherently blocky and didot-ish it look heavier in long texts.
