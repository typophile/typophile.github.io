body: The publication is a small fanzine, directed towards youth/young adults. A "karabin"
  is a gun. I'm not really sure about the a, neither the K. Please give your opinions
  on the masthead, but bare in mind I'm new with letters.

  body: We're writing about creativity and life, and there's a great deal of music
    in there as well. It's a small project, only to be read by friends and family,
    but I'd still like to do it properly.

  body: I guess this fell of the front page pretty quick. Forgive me for bumping it
    back into attention. Karabin is carbine in english, by the way.

  body: It's got a blackletter vibe to it. Not sure if that's what your audience is
    looking for. You may want to look at other blackletter fonts and see how they
    resolve such issues.

  body: "good start frode\r\n\r\nThe K feels too plainly geometric in relation to
    the other letters, and the waist is rather low slung. You might play with the
    upper arm perhaps. It might seem too heavy if you move the waist up.\r\n\r\nThe
    squared-off 'a' is kinda cool, but it doesn't seem to mesh/match 100 percent with
    the r-b-n.\r\nmaybe for this zine, that's a good thing.\r\n\r\nthe spacing needs
    some slight work.\r\n\r\nmaybe the a-r and the a-b might need ever-so-slight widening
    and the b-i slight reduction. (just a hair)\r\n\r\nthe r-a pair feels okay small,
    but larger feels like it needs more air.\r\n\r\ngood luck."

  body: "I'm leaning towards the squared-off lc 'a'. The masthead should be distinct.\r\nBeejay:
    I'm struggeling with the uc 'K'. I hoped to do some of that angled vs. curved
    thing with it, but couldn't find a good solution. I'm quite happy with it as it
    is, but I'm open (and looking) for suggestions.\r\nThank you for the response.
    Just what I'm looking for."

    the 'i' is a little loose though, maybe it needs to be hugged a little closer......."

  body: "yes, now that you point it out the top of the 'b' looks abrupt.  I know it's
    following the pattern of the bottom of the 'r','i' and 'n'.\r\n\r\nWhat if yo
    were to try rounding off the top of the ascender of the 'b' accoring to the rounded
    ball of the 'r', or the survy bottom policy seen on the 'k','a' and 'n'?\r\n\r\nIt
    might work, I'd like to see if it helps you or not, just my 2\xA2"
