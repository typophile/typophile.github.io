body: "Hi folks!\r\nI'm a 3rd year design student and my latest assignment is a font
  showcase that reflects an interesting background or story to a font. Everyone is
  doing the usual (johnston in the london trasport font...clearview for highway signs
  etc) but I wanted something different. Ive been trawling books and the net for days
  but with no luck. Anyone got anything interesting about a font that not many people
  know?"

  body: The story behind the naming of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Eaves">Mrs
    Eaves</a>, nominee for the Almost as Ubiquitous as Times New Roman Award, is amusing
    and has a bit of type history trivia to it. Though I admit that the Estupido Espezial
    story is way better.

  body: "this is interesting, however\r\n\r\nI was trawling through my local cd shop
    and noticed a cover which caught my eye. It was an album by indy Australian band,
    The Fauves titled WHEN GOOD TIMES GO GOOD. Upon its sleeve face was a photograph
    of an old message board (like one from a 50th wedding anniversary or what have
    you). Whilst the digital rendering was spot on the designer made a fatal error
    of judgment. Mr Michael Ebbels - although your random kerning amused me, Din (designed
    in 1994) was not, has not been made into plastic pin on lettering for primitive
    message boards. \r\n\r\nDiscuss,\r\n\r\n"
