<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi guys!
I am designing a four page brochure for a Medical University.
The fonts I have picked for the project are
Sans – Headline Serif – Body Text
FF Scala Sans and Serif or
FF Nexus Sans and Serif or
FF Absara Sans and Serif
I wanted to use Gill Sans initially, but I think it is overused and besides there is no Gill Serif to go with it. IMHO these fonts though resemble it, are actually better.
If you guys were to pick 2 pairs among these what would it be? Better if anyone of you can tell me what the actual difference between them is and which to go for.
Please help me with your expertise in this regard. I would be grateful for the same.
Regards,
lordkv
P.S - I have attached the preview versions of all three in order of Scala (Left), Nexus (Right) and Absara (Below)
</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I like Absara because Scala is being over done these days. Scala's presentaion is art-deco meets industrial europe- like DIN. Absara is geometric too but more subtle. However, I recommend you choose the one you like.
Also think about Amor from Storm Type Foundry:
http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/pdf.php?pdf=F58
Its maybe to soft for your project though... but check out the PDF to see if you like it.
All my best,
Mikey</div>

Actually, there sort of is a "Gill Serif." <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=M.125983.0.0">Joanna</a>, which is designed by Eric Gill is often used as Gill Sans' serifed counterpart.
You might also find that Gill Sans/Joanna have much in common with Scala Sans/Scala. From what I understand, Martin Majoor closely studied Gill's designs when creating the Scala family.
As for Gill Sans being overused, I don't think anyone can justly fault you if you use it well.</div>

Yes Absara was on my mind but needed second opinion. Amor is beautiful might actually be tempted to go for it. Joanna hmmm this is certainly the serif I wanted, now I am confused. Will see it in detail and decide. Appreciate your help guys.

<div class=commentbody>I think Amor is too stylish for a medical brochure.
I never knew about the Gill/Joanna connection and can't say I really see it, especially in the italics.
Gill Sans is a maddeningly incomplete family, I like Scala (I'm less familiar with Nexus & Absara) because it has an expert collection, native small caps, etc. Ultimately you'll find you get a lot of bang for your buck with the FF families.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joanna is a nice companion for Gill, but if there is a Gill Serif it is Perpetua.
I agree with Patty, the detailing in Amor serif is too severe for something like this.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes after trying out Amor, I realized its not best suited for the task. Think I will go for Scala Serif and Sans. Just out of curiosity, what are the other best combinations. I have 2 in mind
1. Auto and Dolly
2. The usual Helvetica Neue and Garamond Pro.
$ is not a issue so please feel to suggest me what you guys think is the best or currently the most sought after.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Seria/Seria Sans (also from Martin Majoor and quite similar to Nexus)
Quadraat + sans
This topic - serif/sans combos -has been covered before - will try to dig up the thread.

<div class=commentbody>You might check <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/site/fonts.php?id=2" target=_blank>Fedra</a> - in my opinion, it's a strong family and could match the topic.

<div class=commentbody>Seria seems like Nexus. The long ascenders and descenders seems appropriate for texts in books though. Not sure about brochure although the readability will certainly be enhanced. Definitely not Quadraat as its x height is too much and Priori is a bit too fancy. No disrespect just my thoughts .I am grateful as you are kind enough to help me. Yeah luckily dough is not a factor at all as i get good returns from it.
Fedra's good but not sure about it as not seen it in action. Will keep my options open though as I have time to decide.</div>

Auto is too playful. Joanna is too poetic (for me). Dolly is nice.
Lisboa, Legacy, Documenta, Freight are also other fonts that have matching sans and serif counterparts.

<div class=commentbody>LordKV> good choice... Scala is way too popular and you can be one of the first designers to start using Absara. Then in a few years we'll be talking about how Absara is way over done too.
