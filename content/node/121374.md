  Democratic Republic of Congo - a portrait of three heroic Congolese women.\r\nHowever,
  I have been struggling with typographic choices, choosing fonts.\r\n\r\nI'd love
  it if you would take a look at the (VERY INCOMPLETE) first cut, and give me suggestions
  on fonts for titles and subtitles:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8ALFcHTB2v0dU95VnFLV3ZZTjA/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nI
  tried out different \"African style fonts\" for the main title, but they all looked
  stereotypical and wrong. I much prefer what I call \"respectful fonts\" that emphasize
  the heroic aspect of these ladies, but it would still be nice to get something organic
  in there.\r\nI considered hand painted fonts, but haven't found anything good.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can probably tell I'm a noob in the world of typography, so anything you could
  tell me would be greatly appreciated. :)"

  body: "You are right not to use stereotypical \u2018African\u2019 faces. The font
    doesn\u2019t need to reflect Africa or the struggle of the women. Its purpose
    is to aid communication. Something simple, that works well on screen (mobile/desktop/television
    - wherever your film will be seen) will need certain characteristics such as large
    x-height, if serifed they should be sturdy serifs, it should be a low stoke contrast
    (between the thick and thins) so anything that adheres to these paramenters will
    work. Ideally something that was designed specifically for screen will match,
    take a look at the work of Fontsmith, they work in this field a lot, albeit with
    a branding slant...\r\nbest wishes for the film"

  body: "What John said. The contrast between a \"neutral\" typeface and the powerful
    images will serve better the message (among other considerations, even a non stereotypical
    but \"pretty\" typeface would give the wrong connotation to the video).\r\nYou
    can however, use different typefaces for titles and subtitles, where, in the titles,
    you could have a bit more personality, perhaps using a slab-serif, as suggested.\r\nBefore
    I can give more specuific suggestions, it would be useful to know what kind of
    budget do you have."

      suggestions too!\r\nAs for budget, I don't really have one. Pretty much the
      whole project has been pulled out of my pocket, but I might dip into my credit
      cards if I fall in love with a type. :)"

    for titles, Lato (http://www.latofonts.com/) for subtitles.\r\n\r\nPT Serif for
    titles, PT Sans for subtitles (http://paratype.com/public/), perhaps the sturdier
    Caption cut.\r\n\r\nAlegreya (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya) for
    titles, Alegreya Sans (http://www.huertatipografica.com/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht)
    for subtitles."

    body: "Thank you again for your suggestions! :) I ended up going with Lato and
      Montserrat (I liked how it looked in all caps for the end title), but I might
      still make some adjustments for the YouTube version.\r\nHere it is: https://vimeo.com/112777955"
