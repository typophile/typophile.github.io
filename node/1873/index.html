Imagine that. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>You never got any public credit for those faces, is that correct?</i> <BR> <BR>We never credited the designers in the Image Club or EyeWire catalogs, but we did include attributions <a href="http://www.eyewire.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/View.woa/wa/viewProduct-product=527.htm">on the web site</a>. In fact, you can still view them in amongst the broken remains of the EyeWire site. I was also fortunate (or cursed) enough to have <a href="http://www.eyewire.com/magazine/profiles/hutchinson/index.htm">a designer profile</a> written about my type exploits back when I was still at EyeWire. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>I see that Identifont has you in its database now. Woohoo!</i> <BR> <BR>Yep. I'm very happy to see that finally in place too. I emailed back and forth with David Johnson-Davies quite a bit to get all the Image Club information properly cleaned up and cross-referenced. Plus I was able to give him all of the nit-picky designer credits from my type library database. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>Did you have a script face in the TypeCon gallery?</i> <BR> <BR>Oops. That was mis-credited at TypeCon. I did the design of the sample, not the typeface. The typeface was <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=JBT0000059">Hucklebuck</a> by Jason Walcott (Jukebox). <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;<i>1) Thanks for the link to Stephen's Stockholm typography pics</i> <BR> <BR>You're welcome. These are things that need to be shared. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>2) Do you know what Agfa/Monotype's arrangement with Image Club fonts is?</i> <BR> <BR>My understanding is that AMT purchased the Image Club Type Library, the associated trademarks and the EyeWire website from Getty Images. They did <b>not</b> purchase the remaining Image Club or EyeWire products such as the clip art or stock images). <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>Why do I ask? At $42 USD a pop, these fonts are priced considerably higher</i> <BR>&gt;<i>than most other fonts from Fonts.com. This leads suspicious me to a (probably</i> <BR>&gt;<i>naive &amp; inaccurate) possible conclusion of A/MT the sales of these fonts, but</i> <BR>&gt;<i>at a price point they know won't fly. Eventually they're able to buy out all</i> <BR>&gt;<i>rights to the fonts at a fire sale price. I'm probably way off base here, but</i> <BR>&gt;<i>with older fonts at $22 and new releases at $22 to $32, something seems amiss.</i> <BR> <BR>The current pricing for the Image Club single faces is certainly higher than they were at EyeWire. Although, I always thought that they were underpriced to begin with. I don't think there's any conspiracy here, I suspect that AMT understands that there was some pent up demand for those faces during the dead period of the EyeWire business. Since they already own the library, I don't think there is any advantage to positioning them for failure. <BR> <BR>Of course, I may be a bit biased in my opinions on this subject. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>3) Does the Image Club branding still exist in any way.</i> <BR>&gt;<i>It certainly isn't revealed on Fonts.com</i> <BR> <BR>Other than on my hard drive and in my Image Club archives, I don't think so. Agfa certainly isn't going to be using the Image Club name or brand for anything. AMT's own branding currently wavers between schizophrenic and that glutinous mass of sub-brands and third-party products on the Fonts.com site. I can't see them doing any Image Club specific marketing, even if they do own the brand now. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>I'm really glad that A/MT kept the IC fonts alive, but I've followed them</i> <BR>&gt;<i>through their various homes and I'm curious about their current home.</i> <BR> <BR>I'm pleased they got picked up as well, although in their current state (missing formats, missing weights, strange pricing, no full collection) - I wonder how long they'll last. <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>4) Nice work on east Bloc.</i> <BR> <BR>Thanks. It seems so long ago&hellip;</div>
