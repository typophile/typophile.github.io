    still seems a bit confusing, but I don't live in NYC so maybe it makes more sense

    signs, these are a great improvement. Might be even better if the smaller text
    was somewhat larger.\r\n\r\nhhp: Absolutely right about the left-adjusted two-way
    arrows. They look like someone made a mistake.\r\n\r\n - Herb "

    wording, however, is a big improvement. Kudos to the editor.\r\nThen again, when
    I go to Manhattan I never take a car."

  body: "<blockquote>IMHO, the new design is no better and no worse than the old design.</blockquote>\r\nI
    don't think you believe that yourself. The new design isn't good, but certainly
    less cluttered than the old design. Regardless of opinions, the new design is
    objectively better.\r\n\r\nThe use of the hyphen instead of the en-dash in the
    new design really frustrates me though. I tend to forgive the city's sign shop
    on such practices (though even then I get frustrated by street signs every day),
    though Pentagram should know better. Actually I think this is unforgivable for
    any sign maker.\r\n\r\nThis is going off-topic, but look at what I recently observed
    in a Vodafone store:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMAG3673_4667.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    informed one of the workers about the mistake and she giggled and responded \"I
    didn't do that\". Obviously not, but could you at least report it to your manager?
    I don't necessarily need to get it fixed, but I can't stand the fact that no one
    reports these mistakes so they often go largely unnoticed by most people. With
    the upside-down apostrophe though, I'm sure most people will feel there is something
    off about it. Certainly if they compare it to the apostrophe on the left wall
    of the store, which is the right side up."

  body: "> I think this is unforgivable for any sign maker.\r\n\r\nYep. But I remember
    years ago when a design firm I worked for designed some signs for the city (for
    a special event). We went to the city's sign shop to exam them. The foreman said
    \"You can look at them but we're not changing a damn thing!\""

  body: "I don't understand how people can do a serious job and not care at all about
    the quality. I have higher expectations of people who work with type every day.
    I don't know how long the guy who put the apostrophe upside-down in the Vodafone
    store has been applying lettering, but if you can't get this right, perhaps it's
    not the job for you. I know I'm a perfectionist, which tends to frustrate a lot
    of people, but it infuriates me when people just don't care.\r\n\r\nA while ago
    I was following a lecture and I noticed the guy in front of me was designing some
    kind of advertisement on his laptop and I saw he used hyphens where he should
    be using dashes. I told him he was using the wrong glyphs and told him how to
    type the en-dash. He gave me 5 seconds to communicate that information and when
    he still didn't get it to work within those 5 seconds, he told me \"Never mind
    that\". What the hell? I'm really suppressing an urge to type in all-caps here!
    He wants to be a graphic designer; he should care! If someone points out a mistake
    to me, I make sure to acknowledge it and learn from it. I don't give up after
    seconds and tell myself it's not important. If I didn't know about the correct
    use, I probably don't have any insight on how important it is anyway. But either
    way, importance shouldn't be a consideration. You should do it right, even if
    you're the only one in the world who will notice. At least respect yourself as
    a designer. If you don't care, don't expect me to take you seriously."
