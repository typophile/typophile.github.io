  swooshy letters like this for some time now and I think it will be a cool monoline
  display face. Obviously this is the very beginning, but thought I&#39;d get some
  input. I just started on the caps today... <BR> <BR>Swoon: <BR><a href="http://www.mattdesmond.com/images/swoon.gif"

  body: Yep, I have a few cool ligatures in my sketches. I can&#39;t wait to see what
    the lowercase will look like.

  body: I know, the F is messed. I am going to make the straight lines less straight
    in all of the characters to make it feel more hand drawn. <BR> <BR>This will probably
    get sold through madtype if it ever gets done. It&#39;s really still in the sketching
    stage. The above showing is just expanded strokes in fontog. <BR> <BR>Matt
