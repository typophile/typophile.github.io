body: "What a long ride it has been.\r\n\r\nI started the process of revising my 1,128-page
  <EM>CJKV Information Processing</EM> by signing the contract with O'Reilly Media
  in April of 2007, and actual work started on August 5th, 2007, by working on Chapter
  3. I moved to Chapter 4 on December 31st, 2007. Next was Chapter 6 on January 26th
  of this year. These are the three chapters that are the longest, over 100 pages
  each. I completed all chapters and appendixes at the end of July, and delivered
  the book to O'Reilly Media on August 1st for technical review. Comments and suggestions
  were incorporated by the end of September, and the book was then copyedited. I finished
  incorporating copyedit changes at the end of October. This entire month is being
  used to build the index. I am doing this by setting index markers throughout the
  book.\r\n\r\nThis morning, the book stands at 880 pages. That includes 26 pages
  of front matter, 728 pages for its twelve chapters, and the rest are for appendixes
  and other material. That figure includes the index to date, which is 14 pages. The
  index is expected to grow another 10 to 20 pages before I am done.\r\n\r\nI used
  Adobe FrameMaker to write and typeset First Edition, which was published at the
  end of 1998. Given that I use Mac OS X as my OS on a machine that uses an Intel
  processor, that application was no longer viable for Second Edition. I decided to
  use Adobe InDesign CS3-J (the Japanese version is used because I need access to
  the Japanese-specific typographic controls).\r\n\r\nWhile the table support in Adobe
  InDesign has come a long way, it still has a way to go. I had to develop a workaround
  for table notes, and tables that span pages cannot include a convenient \" (continued)\"
  in the title on subsequent pages.\r\n\r\nThe lack of page number references means
  that I cannot refer to other sections of the book by page number.\r\n\r\nI am currently
  tackling the index. While setting of the markers is fairly easy, and many of the
  controls and options are superb, some of the things that FrameMaker could do, such
  as setting begin and end markers that result in page ranges, and the ability to
  specify character tags for the text associated with the markers, cannot be done.\r\n\r\nAll
  in all, I am very pleased with how Adobe InDesign has worked out. Its typographic
  controls are unmatched. Of course, there are some areas that still need attention,
  mostly related to book or long-document publishing. I hope that my experiences,
  after having been relayed to the InDesgn team, will help to make it a better product
  through appropriate enhancements.\r\n\r\nThe book is scheduled to go to press on
  December 12th. See: [[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471/]]\r\n\r\nNow, back
  to the index\u2026"

    need attention.\u2019 I've never laid out anything as large as your project, nor
    something as technical (most of my projects have been prose or poetry), but I,
    too, have run up against limitations in InDesign that relate to book layout. I
    have a back-burner project to build a better book-design application, and am keeping
    notes on interesting ideas, architectures, etc.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: For xrefs in CS2-3 a to me untested but well spoken about plugin is available
    [[http://www.dtptools.com/product.asp?id=crin|here]]. Are you using the book feature?
    If so, have a look at [[http://indesignhelp.com/indesign-cs3-book-indexing-bug/|this]]
    if the index is not behaving.

  body: "Yes, I am using the book feature. I am also aware of the known indexing bug,
    but the version I am using is not affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe index broke 25 pages
    this morning, and at this point I am having a hard time adding more to it. I am
    clearly on track to deliver it to O'Reilly Media for review on Friday. The Index
    Panel of InDesign is great, and represents a convenient way to see the index information
    for the entire book, or for specific chapters (files). My only complaint there
    is whenever something is done in the Index Panel, any open topics are closed.\r\n\r\nDr.
