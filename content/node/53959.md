  Orleans is one of the oldest cities in the US; in fact, it is older than the United
  States itself. I knew that I would encounter many older signs because of the history
  and age of the city. New Orleans values the past, and sometimes has a hard time
  moving into the present. Because I am a new resident in New Orleans, a couple of
  signs stuck out in my head before I even started taking photos. Port of Call and
  Pandora\u2019s Snowballs have very distressed looking signs. This was not the reason
  these signs stuck out in my head. They were memorable regardless of their condition.
  New Orleans business owners seem to not place importance on having a clean and sterile
  sign to invite tourists, they seem to rely on the old world charm to bring the tourist
  into their establishments.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans is known as being a city that is a
  hybrid of US/European traditions.  New Orleans has a rich Spanish and French history
  and this is present everywhere you look. New Orleans is also a modern city, home
  to two professional sports teams and numerous oil refineries and chemical plants.
  This is also easily seen in some of the signage. There are many hand painted signs
  that employ script fonts from the past, yet there is something very American about
  the Blue Plate signage from a factory that closed down long ago. The dualism of
  New Orleans is seen through its signs. \r\n\r\nThe most noticeable differences between
  signage in New Orleans and the rest of the US is that other cities tend to have
  newer signs. They utilize newer fonts and a less distressed appearance. Old signs
  are not acceptable to the public in those cities and people might not frequent an
  establishment that looks run down from the sign.  This is not to say that New Orleans
  is without newer signage. The new YWCA sign uses Helvetica to create a simple yet
  modern sign on the front of their building. \r\n\r\nThe most distinct thing about
  New Orleans is that the residents and business owners celebrate the new and the
  old, and this is seen in the use of its signage."
