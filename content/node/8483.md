  body: On the TYPO-L list last fall, Michele Miller of Chermayeff &amp; Geismar,
    in a reply to a query about who Wolff Olins hired to make the font, said it was
    an in-house type designer [at Wolff Olins] working with a design team of four
    and that the final templates went to Agfa. Type designer Patrick Giasson added
    that he did the initial typographic development with Adam Throup and Douglas Sellers
    art directing the project. Further development was done by Mike Abbink. &#40;I
    gather that Patrick and the others work for various Wolff Olins offices.&#41;
    Patrick also stated that additional weights, the extended character set and final
    fonts were done by Agfa Monotype US.

  body: If you can manage with one weight, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=SG.9416.0.1"
    target="_blank">DIN 17</a> is interesting. <BR> <BR>Also, I can say with some
    certainty that a rounded version of  <BR>Jan Pool&#39;s FF DIN will be in the
    next FontFont release.
