  body: "Yes, it's a really \"serious\" game to understand, learn or revise typography
    and families.\r\nYou can play with friends (and even with your children, I played
    with my children and they liked it!) like with a \"happy families\" game.\r\nBut
    because typography is not so simple, rules are a bit more difficult with 2 large
    families (10 cards) that count 2 families (a familie count 6 cards), with a superfamilie
    (4 cards) that allow you to catch a other player's familie (only if you can recite
    all fonts in his family). A real pleasant time, be sure!\r\n\r\nThese cards are
    also real specimens to present 60 fonts \u2013 classics or recents from worldwilde
    foundries (Linotype, Underware, 256tm, 205, B&P Typefoundry, FF, OurType, etc.)\r\n\r\nDon't
    hesitate...\r\n"
