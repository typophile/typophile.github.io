body: I am a typeface designer and I have just switched to Mac OS X 10.3.5 Panther
  and Freehand 10. <BR>I used to use Freehand 9 and OS 9. I was happy with that. Now
  when I test my fonts in FH 10 I see that the built-in kerning in installed typefaces
  is not recognised. Has anybody else noticed this? or am I doing something wrong.  <BR>I
  always slagged off Powerpoint for being a presentation tool that showed lousy type
  with no kerning. Surely Macromedia haven&#39;t taken a backward step. Is there anything
  that can be done to rectify this problem? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for any contributions.

  body: Freehand 10 is a steaming turd. It&#39;s perhaps one of the worst programs
    MM has ever released. <BR> <BR>Dump it as soon as you can and upgrade to FH11.
