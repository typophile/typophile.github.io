  body: "For the XENOTRONICS part: That was a predigital face called Paprika - a duoline
    version of Tabasco. The only two digital versions I'm aware of are Softmaker's
    Tab Deco and WSI's Tabatha Fresco. Both companies produced lots of ripoff fonts,
    so I'm not going to even try to find a download link.\r\n\r\nNote that the N and
    R shown were alternate characters that I don't think are available in either font.
    Modification of the fonts' existing N and R would be easy, though."
