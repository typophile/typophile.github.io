    been a graphic designer and web developer who was tasked with creating a government
    agency's intranet using MS SharePoint, my suggestion would be to come to terms
    with the fact that your site will likely not be clean and eye-catching in any
    way. It will, ultimately, look like a SharePoint site.\r\n\r\nNow, if it's *not*
    a sharepoint site, I'd have to ask why are you using SharePoint Designer. So,
    I assume it is. Also, FYI, SharePoint Design is a dangerous tool to be using against
    the production SharePoint farm. Sane SharePoint Admins will block access to SharePoint
    Designer. \r\n\r\nYou *can* hack SharePoint, but it's work. And, ultimately, a
    giant hack. It's not worth the headache, IMHO. Spend time on training, standards
    policies, and governance instead. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, in terms of looking
    into best practices for intranets, The Nielson/Norman group have some very nice
    reports on intranet design that they release once a year. \r\n\r\n"
