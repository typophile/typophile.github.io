body: "I have most of my glyphs in the correct places, and then use Glyph - Create
  Glyphs, to fill in the European characters with accents , which works fine, but
  if I change the side bearing on the master character it's not updated in the glyphs
  that use this character. For example if I have the \"a\" glyph and the grave glyph
  in place and use Create Glyph when selecting the agrave glyph, the agrave glyph
  is created. If I then change the sidebearing on the \"a\" glyph it doesn't seem
  to be updated in the agrave. Is this normal or is there a way to update the sidebearings
  on all glyphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nR ; ) "

    arrow \u2013 click it and select \"copy to composites\". Then you get the same
    sidebaerings.\r\n\r\nYou could also do metrics classes of course. Either via the
    class-panel or the Metrics Assistance."

  body: Goran, I'm not seeing the little arrow you speak of. Can you give us a screen
    shot of it?

  body: I don't have the arrow. Maybe this is a PC verse Mac thing. In the manual
    for the PC they say something about a green patch, but it also doesn't appear,
    maybe because I haven't automatically used the 'create glyphs' for accents...

  body: "Quick tested it; you only get that arrow when you create an accented glyph.
    Example, I double clicked '\xE1' to 'activate' it, and a copy of 'a' is pasted
    into it automatically. \r\nAfter that when you go to the metrics of 'a', and click
    the preview, the arrow is there."

    The lower case o will work if you have built ograve or odieresis for example.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    at first but have adjusted it manually, so I guess the link is gone. '
