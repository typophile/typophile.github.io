  body: "Well Dave, you seem to have a good start with Cantarell. I like the character
    of this font. It seems very clean and easy to read.\r\n\r\nHowever (and you knew
    it was coming), many of the curves just seem wrong. It's not exactly your fault,
    either. It has to do with the lack of precision when working with FontForge's
    Spiro capabilities. I would recommend converting the curves back into cubic splines
    and then manually fine-tuning them. This will help with the color and evenness
    of the glyphs in the font, and it will make it easier to read. For example, the
    'a' and 'e' caught my eye first because the curves seemed especially lumpy. At
    certain points each glyph appears either overly wide or overly skinny.\r\n\r\nWhen
    looking at the characters beyond Basic Latin, I noticed a few irregularities.
    I think that the small letter eth (\xF0) could benefit from some reworking. A
    good article to look at would be [[http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/2.1.4.eth.htm|this
    one]]. A few diacritics could use some touch-ups as well, such as <code>breve</code>,
    <code>hungarumlaut</code>, <code>macron</code>, and <code>ogonek</code>.\r\n\r\nOn
    a less-significant/purely-technical note: it would be more correct to rename your
    'italic' faces as 'oblique' faces because the style of the font has not been changed
    to accommodate the standards of italic typefaces. If you want to make an italic
    version, more is needed than just slanting the regular face.\r\n\r\nI am not the
    most experienced typophile, and I'm sure someone else could chime in and provide
    more comments but I hope this helps."

  body: 'Wesley, thanks for your kind comments :) I''d dearly appreciate a diagram
    of where precisely you feel the curves are lumpy, wide or skinny. I fully acknowledge
    that the diacritics and family members need much more work (and you are quite
    right, really I should call the oblique members such, as just updated the site
    to refect this :-) '

  body: "I second Wesley's advice about the different curve types. Each curve type
    lends itself to a certain curve \"flow\", and when converting twice (from Spiro
    \u2192 cubic \u2192 quadratic splines) without any corrections inbetween, you
    are sure to end up with uneven curves and too many points.\r\n\r\nAbout the wide
    and skinny parts: I think you've got the stroke contrast not quite right in many
    of the glyphs. Try writing your letters with a broad-nib pen to see where the
    thick and thin parts end up. This image shows the original letters on the left
    and my corrected versions on the right, with slightly increased stroke contrast
    to make it clearer:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cantarell_6081.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    red ellipse represents the broad nib. Of course you have to apply optical corrections
    to the stroke widths where needed later, but you get the idea ...\r\n\r\nHow important
    is hinting on the Google Android platform, which you target? On Windows, TT fonts
    without hinting look pretty bad. Especially for screen fonts, there should be
    good hinting. But that's something to care about later, first try to improve on
    the glyph designs."
