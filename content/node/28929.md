  et al.), but havent been able to figure out what it is, can anyone point me in the
  right direction?\r\n\r\nMerci!"

    inconsistencies between identical characters.

    is close, but I feel like there must be something closer.\r\n\r\nI think you might
    be right though, now that I look at the inconsistencies here:\r\nhttp://img212.imageshack.us/img212/2134/maslz1.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help :)"
