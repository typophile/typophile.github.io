  anyone know any background on this? I ran across it in a discussion in another forum.
  \ It doesn't seem to be of much practical use, but at least it offers some interesting
  ideas for ligatures."

    in countries that have poor spelling to sound correspondences, than in countries
    with a strong relationship between spelling and sounds. If this is true, than
    switching to a phonetic alphabet would reduce the occurrence of dyslexia. Of course
    cultures are reluctant to change their orthographies, so a phonetic teaching alphabet
    is a transition alphabet to help a child learn to read with regular spelling to
    sound correspondences before transitioning to the less regular orthography.\r\n\r\nCheers,
