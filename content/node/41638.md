  I'm looking for a digital version of Bradbury Thompson's Alphabet 26. The archive
  pulls up discussion regarding dyslexia and another regarding unicase fonts. Not
  the topics I'm interested in.\r\n\r\nAny mention of Alphabet 26 links to: [[http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.htm|http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.htm,]]
  which states \"Paul Baker, with feedback from the late Bradbury Thompson, has produced
  a new, digital version of Alphabet 26. It will soon be available here, and from
  Monotype Typography.\" There's no date on the article, nothing shows up elsewhere
  on the Baker website, and Monotype's fonts.com doesn't list it either.\r\n\r\nThough
  Peignot, Filosofia, Panoptica, and Hammer's uncials are all fine, I'm not looking
  for an alternative unicase. Any hints, suggestions, options? Is there an Alphabet
  26 out there by another name?  Or do clever folks just build one themselves? "

    go that far, he just re-arranged the furniture. He used Baskerville because its
    lower case and small caps have the same x-height--at least, in the version available
    to him.\r\n\r\nSo if it's for your own use, you should be able to insert the a,
    e, m and n glyphs from the lower case into the small cap font, using a font editor,
    and spit out your unicase font pretty easily. \r\n\r\nHowever, for full use, there
    may be some more work required, making small cap lining figures, and aligning
    the punctuation.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been lots of redesigns of Bodoni, Garamond
    and Jenson, not so much Baskerville."
