body: "Just found this, and thought I'd share it with everyone:\r\n\r\nAs designers,
  we sometimes forget that not everyone can see color the same way we do. I found
  a sweet app that allows you to simulate what color blindness does to your designs,
  whether it be interface design or the composition of a 4-color poster.\r\n\r\nHere's
  an example of this page as viewed by someone with color blindness:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture-2010-01-27-at-9_4377.01.45-AM.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
  this free app for Windows, Linux and Mac simulates how approximately 5% of all men
  will see your designs. It's a pretty cool app to add to your toolbox o' design stuff.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  the app is here http://colororacle.cartography.ch/"

  body: I am colour blind (deuteronopia), and it is eerie how I cannot notice anything
    out of the ordinary with the colours in the sample above. Only because the elements
    like the Font Bureau advert are on the same page enabling side-by-side comparison
    do I see that the colours are actually different. When people with normal colour
    vision see the above sample and immediately notice that the colours are off?
