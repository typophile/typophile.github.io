  body: When you say customised, do you just mean adjustments to the font within an
    application like Illustrator?  Adjustments pertaining to the leading, tracking,
    kerning, etc...?

  body: The dot on a Univers 'i' is a square, whereas this one's a circle. Other than
    that it's the same.

  body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply.  I got the univers condensed font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/careerbuilder_univers_3927.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    top one is from illustrator.\r\nThe middle is the original\r\nThe bottome is photoshop\r\n\r\nIt
    may just be that the font is very pixelated, but it seems that their font is bolder,
    and skinnier at the same time, no?\r\n\r\nThe Illustrator file is straight up,
    and the photoshop file is using light condensed with a faux bold.\r\n\r\nI aslo
    tried putting a stroke on the font in illustrator, almost there if not there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/careerbuilder_univers2_5410.jpg]"
