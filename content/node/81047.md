  it? I printed out a page and I love the way it looks, but not sure about the readability
  factor. Any help or alternate suggestions is appreciated. The book is full length
  fiction, hardboiled crime/horror. I'm not pressed for space so I can be generous
  with size and leading (yay!)\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/wilke/\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    to serve the purpose\u2014generous leading for sure. I have been tempted in the
    past to use it simply for its uppercase Q (roman and italic). However, if I recall
    correctly it does not have small caps or old style figures, and thus was a non-starter
    for book typesetting."
