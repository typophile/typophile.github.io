  I should look at for inspiration? Thank you.

    experiment, or feel their way, to good design. Sure there is method to the madness,
    but there is always madness to go along with the method. \r\n\r\nAlexey Brodovitch

    body: typographically experimental meaning if it said 'These words are crashing'
      then the words would be actually crashing letter by letter down the page and
      onto the end of the page to communicate that.

    I think the accurate description would be  \"literal graphic treatment\" or \"cliche

    can't also be experimental? I wasn't aware that the two were such mutually exclusive

  body: "Sup Ben, In the Essay I link to, it mentions that, depending on how you define
    an experiment, all typography is an experiment, and 'to experiment' is a \"part\"
    of the design process. Giggly mentioned Lupton, so her thoughts might have been
    with the whole cranbrook in-crowd. I was pointing out about the definition of
    the word, and more that the peps should/could go and read an interesting essay
    and learn for themselves too! (as the essay also mentions that it can be up to
    individual desgners interpretations).  Semantics!\r\nI like how Tiff through Paul
    Rand in, and Dezcom hit us with Max Bill, thats the shizza."

    is about experimental <em> type design</em>. Miss G's question is about experimental<em>
    typographic layout</em>. \r\n\r\nIf you have deduced the idea that 'all typography
    is an experiment' from Hamish Muir's quote then I think you should re-read the
    essay; it is used in the text as an illustration of diversity of opinion \u2013
    it is really not the main thrust of the essay \u2013 and it is immediately balanced
    by a counter statement from Melle Hammer (which I think is probably nearer the
