    to be that FEX is an excellent font manager (and free), that FontAgentPro is sturdy
    and quick to update necessary Plug-Ins and everything from Extensis somewhat shady.\r\n\r\n.

  body: Good summary, though it might not be fair to throw out the Suitcase until
    the latest Fusion is tested.

    which is a surefire way of making things too complicated for the end user.\r\nWhen
    I was using MasterJuggler in the OS 9 days (THE font manager omhp), they had like
    three updates in a period of seven, eight years, whilst Suitcase went to something
    like 20, 25.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    rather than to hold off releasing an update for months or years while there is
    a known flaw in the current release, then charge for a full upgrade price for
    what amounts to making the thing you bought work as originally advertised plus
    a token new feature. \r\n\r\nNot to say that's necessarily the case with any of
    the above programs, but I have experienced the latter treatment from some vendors.
    \r\n\r\nI prefer the approach that releases (as) frequent (as necessary) updates
    with a built-in notification mechanism in the application. Of course it's nice
    when they get it totally right the first time, but that just doesn't happen in
    the world of software development anymore (and was rare when it did)."

    must respectfully disagree.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of specific evidence to the
    contrary, I'd assume the same number of bugs are getting fixed per year, regardless
    of number of updates. Any program of really large size such as a serious font
    management application has hundreds, maybe even thousands of \"known issues.\"
    In and of itself, the difference between an update every three years and three
    updates a year tells you nothing in particular about sloppy programming or quality
    control.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd prefer more frequent updates, but I really consider
    it a personal preference rather than anything else. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    is true; known issues should be eliminated before release whenever possible. However,
    when problematic issues do make it into a release, they should be addressed as
    quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look back to the last year a certain small yet
    significant developer was around as a graphics software company. They had many
    products which were incomparable with their feature sets, but released on a schedule
    determined more by marketing concerns than whether the software was really ready.
    Some had so many bugs as to be barely workable. But, rather than releasing an
    immediate patch to address these issues, they let them go for extended periods
    of time until put forth as an omnibus upgrade. All in the interest of <em>looking
    like</em> their quality control wasn't as sloppy as it was.\r\n\r\nThen, for some
    reason they decided the would become an \"internet company\" and sold off all
    their graphics software properties to other companies (in some cases back to the
    original developers they licensed them from). I haven't heard from this company
    since."
