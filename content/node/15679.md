    An Aristocrat Among Working Men", by Patrick Duffy. Or, "The Swifts: Printers
    in the Age of Typesettig Races" by Walker Rumble. Some really great stories in
    both volumes.'

    \"Critical Comments\" parts of the pages and the tabbing, to set them it must
    have been pretty darned expensive!\r\n\r\n\r\nRodiThe Truth shall set you free"
