  body: Not sure if Roman examples will be of use, but Martin Majoor has an open "b"
    in <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_ot_collection/>Scala</a>
    and <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_nexus_serif/>Nexus</a>
    serif. Unfortunately, he closes it for the italics.

    Interestingly, both these are open in the roman and closed in the italics. I wonder
    what the logic behind that is.

    it'll appear in the crit section shortly. Or not so shortly, depending on how
    long the caps and numerals take to rein in."
