    the sum of the Ascender and the Descender <em>as a positive number</em> do not
    total the font's UPM size.

    it's because FontLab will generate the error message if the two numbers don't
    add up to 1,000, in this case. It's just something FontLab does..."

  body: "@tedbreakmore\r\n\r\nYou beat me to it. Thanks. I was going to post this
    question because I'm getting this message quite frequently also.\r\nIt would be
    nice if the error message was at least grammatical, eh?\r\n\r\nI assumed bbox
    meant the bounding box (see the FL documentation), but this is a per-glyph thing
    and I couldn't see how one could have ascender/descenders sum to that.\r\n\r\nAnd
    what happens if you just say, \"Hell, screw it. So it doesn't sum to the bbox
    size. Big deal.\"\r\nAnything bad? I haven't visually seen any problems as yet.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the link, Bill. And what are you talking about - it *is* fun!\r\n\r\nrich"
