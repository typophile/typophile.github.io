  online business selling GPS navigation units for Audi & Volkswagen. There a few
  issues me and my client are having:\r\n\r\n1. Can't decide which of these logotypes
  are appropriate for the market. His competitors are doing a terrible job establishing
  an aesthetic, so we have to make a new one. The trouble is in what fits a business
  dealing with medium-high range luxury vehicles (said from an average income perspective
  of course:)\r\n\r\n2. Can't decide on layout decisions, my client is having a great
  deal of trouble choosing, so am I since my clients are usually very opinionated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys,\r\n\r\nTypophile's interface makes you want to really join the community!
  (y)\r\n\r\n<3 to all type lovers.\r\n\r\noh and i understand that most of the work
  you see here is not design for print.\r\n"

  body: I agree with eliason. I like the top right logo. But I assume "vag" is supposed
    to stand for Volkswagen Auto Group. In all lowercase, it looks less than V-A-G
    than it does a word that's slang for, well, a word that starts with "vag." I wonder
    if you could create a logo in the spirit of that one, but in all caps (at least
    for the VAG part of it).

  body: "i initially thought i was done when i made the top right logo. but i think
    your right jonathan, lowercase it looks a little wrong. maybe including the dots
    for abbreviation or maybe i'll just use small caps for the v.a.g. component. Thanks
    guys...Great help.\r\n"
