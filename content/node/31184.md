  an investment. I'm torn between Scala Sans and Freight Sans. Basically, I'm looking
  for a family that has a wide range of applications (from text to signage). Also,
  which one of these fonts do you think has the best companion serif design? (I'll
  purchase this family in the near future) Which one is the best value for the money?
  Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nIvan"

    the same, though you can buy individual weights of [[FF Scala]], if that makes
    sense for your needs.\r\n\r\nAs for style, FF Scala is more distinctive so may
    not be as useful for a broad range of jobs.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Freight is
    spaced very tightly so will need some extra care for text."

    sans with individual weights available and also an expert collection. It's a bit
    more expensive tho.

    love about it Stephen, and why you went for it Mili. For example, isn''t there
    a lot of competition for an old style serif with short ascenders? For humanist
    sans? Are people in love with the design? Is the completeness a key feature? Eg
    are people buying the all the variations? '

  body: "I needed a combination of sans and serif that would work well together in
    a single word. After trying to pair various combinations I started to look for
    a not too expensive family with both. I liked Freight text's italic k and r and
    the clean shapes of the sans. In the end it's all subjective, I just liked the
    font. I might not have bought all varieties had that been an option, but now I'm
    happy it wasn't. Still looking for an project that would give me an excuse to
    buy the Micro.\r\nI didn't realise it was such a popular one when I bought it."

  body: "William - I think any family with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/virtual/newsletters/jun2006_b/\">serif
    and sans companions</a> is appealing simply due to its versatility. As for Freight's
    popularity, these all factor in:\r\n\r\n- The sans hits all the right notes for
    contemporary typography: large x-height, open forms, wide, nothing too quirky
    but more humanist than geometric.\r\n- <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop\">Darden's
    documentation and samples</a> lend it a lot of credibility.\r\n- The Micro weight
    is intriguing.\r\n\r\nAnd here is Freight as featured in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157594511485997/\">QBN

    real plus--and I think it's pretty difficult to pull off well, so hats off to
    Joshua Darden. \r\n\r\nStephen, what's interesting is that your rather complete
    list is pretty short. By the way I'm surprised you didn't include Scala & Scala
    sans in your 'pairs' list, as I think this was the first one so designed and very
    successful, no? "

    but that doesn't mean they should be bought and used as a team.\r\nI was just

    not to say they are bad--but for the layperson I think it is a wonderful way to
    introduce them to typography and the possibilities of going beyond Times and Helvetica.
