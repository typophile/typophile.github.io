  body: "I really like it, though it all seems just a bit too wide for my taste...\r\nSome
    letters remind me of Jeremy Tankard's Aspect, and maybe that's why I can't help
    feeling like there's something missing on the lowercase D, especially on the regular
    version. Recently I visited Hubert Jocham's site and this lowercase G \u2013 which
    I love \u2013 reminds me of his lowercase Gs, which are always refreshing (though
    I also don't like them all).\r\n\r\nI agree with Christian on the 1, N and L,
    and would probably add the M to that, since those things hanging on the top left
    of the letters seem too long (I don't know what to call those \"things\"... help
    me out, here!). This is especially noticeable on the regular version, too.\r\n\r\nAnd
    about the I... are the top serifs pulled to the left on purpose?\r\n\r\n\r\nrubenD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nedit:
    well, maybe not the M... I guess the slant of its legs compensates for the length
    of that thing which I don't know what to call because I really need to pay more
    attention to the vocabulary!"

  body: "It's growing on me! I should stop looking at it! :P Those things are kind
    of blending in... \r\n\r\nBeing picky, but maybe the stroke on the S should be
    just a little bit thicker on the middle... the bottom part of the curve seems
    like it's almost going upwards for a moment, there."

    was me pleased, probably has some influence.\r\nthank you reminded Hubert Jocham's
    fonts--i revised them once again with pleasure.\r\ni continue work over this typeface,
    so i will pay more attention to said moments.\r\nthank you!"
