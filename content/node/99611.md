  body: Thanks chaps. Amazing help! I think TicketBook is probably the closest. I
    can change a few of the characters to make it 99%. I wonder what they used originally?

  body: Don't know the original typeface but if you only take in consideration the
    creation date, Helvetica Ultra Compressed is probably one of the closest you could
    get from this time period.

  body: I agree, even though the S is considerably different, but then I immagine
    in this period there were just loads of variants of Helv Ultra Compressed and
    this was one of them.
