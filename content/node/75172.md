body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nWe maintain a font for a client that we're moving to OpenType
  and they want to make the bold version a little heavier while we do this.\r\n\r\nI
  can use the bold effect to get the glyphs to look the way I want them but is there
  a way to get Fontlab to expand the width of the character as well when changing
  the weight of the glyph? Seems like this would be a basic function but I've not
  yet found it.\r\n\r\nI imagine with Python I might be able to script something to
  \"record\" the bearings, adjust the glyph weight and reset the bearings to what
  they were but I've NO idea how to even begin using Python.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\nKen"

    font alongside, select all glyphs, choose Copy, switch to the bold font, choose
    Edit / Paste Special, and only paste the sidebearings. '
