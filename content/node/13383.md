  card and logo design for a digital audio design firm called FiberPack Audio. As
  you can guess by the name they specialize in fiberoptic packetized transmission
  of digital audio, specifically multichannel as in broadcast stations and concert
  halls.\r\n\r\nThey wanted something very cool and modern, with a simple layout,
  emphasizing the form as the design. Somewhat of a cross between an architecture
  firm and a modern art gallery design.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI went for black text on
  a grey card to give that concrete wall feel.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think:"

  body: I think the type, for 'Fiberpack Audio' is neither too 'cool' nor 'modern'
    and it rather looks pretty 'old school', or even vintage.. :) <em>( And, I may
    have to admit, that I am not quite fond of the 'barcode' element in there, but
    maybe thats just me.. )</em>

  body: 'First nothing stands out. All your elements are fighting for attention. Ask
    yourself what do I want the viewer to see first? The band of fiber below the business
    discription is distracting and doesn''t add to the look. Now my pet pieve, why,
    is it that every design now has to have type letterspaced. There is no reason
    for it, it doesn''t help your design. Please look at other typefaces, how about
    Mecury that is used for the titling at this forum. Change the gray to silver.
    Just some thoughts '

  body: "Thanks for the comments! I was not too pleased with the Fiberpack Audio typeface
    myself. It is actually just a modified Gill Sans, but it didn't quite turn out
    how I thought it would. The letterspacing is a client request. He showed me some
    examples of other designs he liked and pretty much all of them were letterspaced.
    But I would certainly be open to some ideas on how fill out the horizontal space
    of this businesscard without it.\r\n\r\nThe Mercury-Alt might be nice. Part of
    the reason I joined typophile is to learn what new faces are out there that I
    have never used before. So thanks for that!\r\n\r\n<a href=http://typophile.com/files/fiberpack-business-card.gif>Here</a>
    is a very different version that I think has a stronger design, but conforms less
    to the company identity."

  body: "One of the best things about printing on a mid tone background is that black
    and reversed out type works well if you print it as a two colour job. To me your
    layouts look a little too much like the back of a credit card. Try an asymmetrical
    layout. The later logo using that bauhaus type is not a good choice for modern/clean.\r\nFrom
    a type point of view in the telephone numbers consider raising the braces and
    the dash so that the numerals aren't bursting from the top and individually kern
    them the space around the 1s is too great whereas the at symbol in the e-mail
    address is large.\r\nTim"

  body: "What about exploring the potential graphic potential of optical fiber. It's
    use of light waves, gives it enormous potential. Though the work is derived from
    calculations/variations of such, the work of Casey Reas is often inspirational
    point for myself. \r\n\r\nThere are probably alot more sources that are more appropriate,
    but who know where you could jump from there.\r\n\r\nHave you done background
    research on exactly what optical fiber is?\r\n\r\nwww.wikipedia.org - for simple
    overview.\r\n\r\nYour example says nothing new as related to any architecture
    fir/modern art gallery. I would agree with the dated look.\r\n\r\nExplore the
    technology a bit, get a feeling, then create.\r\n\r\n"

    eye will go directly to that dot of ink. Thats what you have to think of with
    your card. The persons name and email address can be a lot smaller and probably
    shouldn''t be knocked out of a black bar. White space even if its gray is a good
    thing. Did you investigate creating a mark that represents the company (weaving
    fiber optics?) and not over designing the type. '

  body: "If you're still taking advice and critiques...\r\n\r\nI see two themes in
    the comments here that could lead you in strong directions:\r\n\r\n1) The type
    in both examples is retro, not contemporary. Avoid type that screams 'I am from
    X decade!' (Also, choose type that's either the same family, or has more contrast
    than your first example.)\r\n\r\n2) Explore the technology further. Both sound
    and fiber optics have threading/weaving curves. Your design could take so many
    vibrant and energetic directions based on that alone. The unique aspect is the
    packeted data. This, to me, suggests mindfully breaking the curves into segments,
    which could set your logo design apart from other wave-based logos. There's a
    lot of simple, modern potential here, particularly with elegant curves and figure-to-ground
    tricks using breaks in the curves.\r\n\r\nLet the type and the mark coalesce through
    your explorations. The visual potential here is probably strong enough to lead
    the type choice."

    that are either from the same family, or have more contrast between them than
    your first example." Not sure why I wrote it the other way.

  body: 'I like the your new design but I don''t think the square with the stars is
    giving the right impression. Especially with the green color, it made me think
    of an army depot or something like that. The name says otherwise obviosluy, but
    that little icon says a lot. Maybe a speaker? Headphones, somerthing that screams
    audio. Other than that I think the focus has definately shifted to the name, which
    is where it sould be. '

  body: "I would suggest stepping away from the computer right now. It seems like
    your client needs a logo first, a business card second. Do some research on their
    business, what fiber optics are, what the client's business goals are, competitor's
    logos, etc. Then get a pad of paper and sketch. It doesn't matter if you can't
    draw. Just get some ideas quickly on paper. You'll find that ideas will start
    to form out of each other. It may go slow at first, but if you keep trying you'll
    hit that magic point where things just flow. \r\n\r\nAim higher than these fairly
    mundane examples you have shown. It seems like you are just opening the font menu
    and scrolling through your fonts, finding something that looks interesting and
    trying to force a concept to fit around that font. You need to come up with a
    solid concept first, that will make choosing your typeface much easier.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n"

  body: "The new designs are working better but don't make everything green. For contrast
    make the name the paper color (white?). It will add separation from the name and
    all the other information you are providing. Another idea would be to make the
    fibers a tint of gray so they are subtitle and push back. Another way to do that
    is use an Aquious coating on the card and print matte black ink over it covering
    the black other than the fibers and they would be glossy. \r\nMake an effort to
    open up the spacing between the tagline and the mark. Try making all elements
    10% smaller. \r\nAnd Adnix is right get away from the keyboard for a while.  "

  body: "I agree about getting away from the keyboard. Also, avoid the standard font
    list, if you can. It's not helping.\r\n\r\nThe new designs are better, without
    a doubt. I'm not so sure about #6. It doesn't read as an 'F' to my eye and it
    might be too much hassle to make it work (but that's for you to judge). As for
    #5, it's definitely going in the right direction, but the fibers are very wispy
    and fragile looking. They look a bit cluttered, and at small sizes a logo like
    that will fall apart. The thick-to-thin as they curve is very nice, but make each
    thread a bit thicker and make the group more orderly. I'm not digging the Optima,
    either. I'd go with something more geometric and constructivist, actually (closer
    to what you used in the bar code business card). Or, a nice, clean contemporary
    serif font."
