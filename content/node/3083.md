body: I did this Logo a while back and am considering it for inclusion in my portfolio.
  Before doing so I would like some feedback. <BR>Text is set in Peter Bilak&#39;s
  beautiful Fedra Sans...one of my all time favorite fonts. <BR>I only did business
  card and logo for client &#40;vs. full collateral&#41;. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26314.jpg"

  body: 'Pretty nice. <BR>How would the swirl render as line art? Maybe little pixels
    that emulate the shading? Or better: thin swirling streaks than taper out as the
    shading gets lighter. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: You had to go there... <BR>Rendering in vector is obviously a nice addition
    &#40;for userbility&#41; in a logo design. I did not take it in that direction
    when I created it for the client, but think it would be worth doing if it is to
    be included in my portfolio as a case study. The thin streaks sound like the best
    solution to me.  <BR>OK, I am going to park that for a few days and try it out
    when I have less deadline approaching. Thanks  for the good idea. Hrant.

  body: Normally, I would be in complete agreeance, about the line art / vector, but
    this seemes to work fine for me. I guess it&#39;s because it is a film &#40;motion&#41;
    company. Just my first impression.

  body: 'I&#39;d be worried about the blurry swirl in B/W - what if they had a newspaper
    ad or on a fax or photocopy - once that yellow is gone it won&#39;t look so good. '

  body: here is the businesscards I did. They were printed in Asia with cmyk and laminated
    with thin matte film coating &#40;non-tearable&#41;. Image uploaded has a bit
    of color shift as this was converted back from CMYK<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27124.jpg"

    them?
