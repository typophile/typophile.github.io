		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately, this is a subject of much controversy and claims of a research basis, when no decisive research exists.</p>
<p>I think you can take two tacks on this. The first is to refer to actual large print books published for adults with visions problems.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.gale.com/thorndike/about.htm">this</a>, the world&rsquo;s leading publisher of large print books publishes their books in 16 point Plantin type with black ink on high opacity paper. In my view, the responsiveness of the market is probably the best test that exists now, and may influence your client.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.galeschools.com/thorndike/research.htm">Here</a> is a reference to some research on large print. This is a biassed source, as they are selling large print books to kids, but still it is worth something. They also prefer seriffed fonts.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;research&rsquo; on Tiresias claims the people self-report san serifs as being more legible. This &lsquo;research&rsquo; is <a href="http://screenfont.ca/fonts/today/Tiresias/">very controversial</a> and personally I think is completely unreliable as relates to print.</p>
<p>The other tack to take on this is to report the way typographers and type designers approach this, and their distinctions. Many distinguish between legibility and readability generally. Legibility is the ability to distinguish one letter from another. This is critical for signage.</p>
<p>Reabability has to do with ease of absorbing the message in extended text. The reality is that a very small amount of extended text is done in san-serif fonts, even though they are extensively used in titles and short copy. Hence by the test of what is actually done in print Ariel doesn&rsquo;t hold up.</p>
<p>Typographers and type designers also distinguish between display and text fonts, and between fonts for screen and fonts for print. Arial can work as a display font and as a screen font. As a screen font it has been heavily &lsquo;hinted&rsquo; so that its apprearance is actually very different from in print.</p>
<p>The best way to show that Arial is a bad text font&ndash;and I think it&rsquo;s just awful&ndash;is to put say Plantin or any other classic text font and Arial at the same copy in the same space.</p>
<p>I recently had the following experience. Someone showed me a report in Arial. I said it would be better in Georgia. So I printed it out in the same format. She said, &lsquo;Arial looks more clear to me.&rsquo; (It&rsquo;s what she always used.) Then I said, &ldquo;Try reading it.&rdquo; She said something like: &ldquo;Oh, yeah, it is smoother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me your main convincers are 1. What is actually done today with large print books, and 2. To do two or more settings of the same material, and actually have the client try to read it&ndash;not just look at it. If that doesn&rsquo;t convince then I think you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>

<p>It is a question of &lsquo;compared to what&rsquo;: screen Arial is EASIER to read than many fonts for screen, but it is also much HARDER to read in extended text than any of the widely used seriffed text fonts in print on paper.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks William,</p>
<p>Actually it&rsquo;s all about (<cite>edit:</cite> printed) application forms and my first proposal was set in Myriad Pro which is narrower and definitely easier to read. After my client&rsquo;s previous e-mail with request &ldquo;please could you change the font to Arial&rdquo; I tried to explain the matter and even linked to Mark Simonson&rsquo;s article on Arial. But after my client&rsquo;s last message <cite>&ldquo;we have opted for Arial as it easy to read, and apparently is the choice font for people with eyesight problems (a lot of our clients are the older generation)&quot;</cite> I feel helpless. I don&rsquo;t care if the forms are in whatever typeface as it&rsquo;s not my most important project but would like to somehow politely make my client concious of being wrong.</p>

You can ask your client where he heard this, and give him the links. The large print movement I believe started in England, and you can probably find links there. Or just go to any library and pick the large print books off the shelf. I doubt you&rsquo;ll find a one in Arial.</p>
<p>Whether there is a significant difference between Myriad and Arial for a form, I don&rsquo;t know. If the texts are very short, the questions of layout may be much more important.</p>

<p>Here is what they say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a general rule, stick to typefaces that people are familiar with and will recognise easily, like Arial. Avoid italic, simulated handwriting and ornate typefaces as these can be difficult to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is not a special endorsement of Arial, but a recommendation of anything familiar and not too ornate, like italic and handwriting fonts.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that they mention only Arial. While it is, as you say, Si, a relatively good screen font, there is no evidence that it is better as printed text. And the market place in large print books for those with limited vision goes for serif fonts.</p>
<p>On the RNIB site they mention several teachers producing their own large print books in Arial. It is clear that many people in the UK think Arial has some special readability in print. This is unfortunate as there is zero evidence as to this.</p>
<p>Si, do you think that Arial is significantly better for printed text than Plantin? Significantly worse? No difference?</p>

<p>I may be mistaken, but we have just seen significant evidence. RNIB had recommended it according to you, and still mentions it favorably. That means that significant numbers of those attentive to issues of limited sight in the UK have a positive view of Arial. The three teachers they mention on the site also using Arial in self-produced large print books is also evidence. Also Aleksander&rsquo;s client. As none of these have got it from deep study of the issue, it means that there is something of an &lsquo;urban legend&rsquo; going on. I see these facts, few though they are, as significant evidence of a legend.</p>
<p>Why do you say it is untrue?</p>
<p>Also there is a temptation in those who haven&rsquo;t tried it to think that in general sans must be more legible, because they are simpler. I have seen this again and again, such as in my friend who preferred Arial until she actually tried a side-by-side test in reading.</p>

<p>Chris, I do think this is part of the issue. The legend of the readability of Arial is because it has been the most accessible sans on most people&rsquo;s computers for a long time.</p>
<p>There does seem to be good evidence that large print is helpful to the visually impaired, but none as far as sans vs serif. And certainly not as to whether Arial in particular is good.</p>
<p>I tend toward the view that serifs are generally better for print text, but the fact is that research hasn&rsquo;t decided the issue.</p>
<p>For the RNIB to propagate this is not responsible, in my opinion, and maybe some of you Brits can set them straight as to the state of the research&ndash;and the fact that large-print books are generally in seriffed type, it seems by popular demand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Saw a lecture by one of the most &lsquo;professional sources&rsquo; on readability, Gerard Unger, at the London Typographic Circle a few years ago. In the context of work for a Dutch newspaper he compared Helvetica letterforms (closed shapes) and Frutiger (open shapes) to guests at a party who hadn&rsquo;t been introduced properly. Helvetica was an awkward &ldquo;Hey, do you think we should join together and form words?&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know shall we? Maybe we should, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo; and with Frutiger it was &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s all get together and form words! That would be great!&rdquo;. So if your client is insisting on a sans maybe get them to compare reading Arial with reading the same thing in Frutiger or anything else with a &lsquo;open&rsquo; shapes.</div>

<p>Here you are getting into subtleties that typographers and type designers find quite important. But none of this has been scientifically tested, that I am aware of.</p>
<p>Personally, my take on the relative unreadablity of Arial and Helvetica as text vs the better readability of Unger&rsquo;s sans faces is not only the openness, but also that they are oval rather than round. This changes the way they can space together.</p>
<p>I very much look forward to reading Unger&rsquo;s book on readability, which is about to come out in English.</p>
<p>But at the same time we have public institutions like the RNIB ignorant of both the state of the science and the practitioners' lore. And not only do they not know about these things, but they propagate what is very likely false information :(</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The critical point of this thread seems to me to be is Arial or Myriad, at 6 or 7 point respectively, capable of working in the situation of a form? I am inclined to think that although the difference might be significant the overall effect would be the same – that some readers will find it difficult to read and complete the form. Perhaps the most significant area to advise a change of typeface at this size is the similar forms of some numerals, if they are required in the form.</p>
<p>William, I found the conclusion (that many people believed Arial was endowed with some special readability quality) that you drew, joined too few dots for me to agree. I agree that the effect of RNIB’s advice is wrong, which is why I mentioned it, following a similar thread I wrote to RNIB asking about the sources for their advice, I did not receive a reply, however I don’t believe that they would give the recommendation based on no evidence whether or not it has any genuine research behind it. There are situations where a sans performs better than a serif and for people with some kinds of impairment there is belief and user-evidence that serifs hinder the reader, I believe that the effect is that a lowest common denominator (even if it is inaccurate) has been applied. As I said before the typefaces mentioned by RNIB seem restricted to bundled system fonts and the advice is aimed at giving non-designers best practice guidelines to produce letters, communications etc. unfortunately non-designers insist that this advice is followed in print and without contrary evidence (or even a respected national organisation offering opposing advice) there is sometimes no alternative but to follow their instructions.</p>
<p>I cannot find any authoratitive information that Aleksander can show his client, maybe this will offer some help.

<p>Tim, I wish I could say that I am being unreasonably cynical here. But my experience is whereever there is evidence to support their viewpoint, people will make a point of quoting it. Indeed people often even claim support from evidence when there is none.</p>
<p>I commend you for contacting the RNIB about the issue. If you involve others, such as those teaching typography at Reading, I suspect they will be more forthcoming. The fact that they did not reply reinforces my suspicion that they are expressing an opinion not backed by any kind of testing, scientific or not.</p>
<p>I find it very plausible that they would jump to the conclusion that because sans are simpler they are more readable, because I have seen it often, such as the case of the friend I mentioned.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;text matters&rsquo; guidelines are puzzling because they contradict the RNIB guidelines while refering the them as an authority. Also they do not mention the critical importance of large&ndash;generally greater than 12 pt&ndash;type for the visually impaired. Large type size seems to be the only thing that is really well established as important for the visually impaired. I say this not because of any scientific paper, but simply that large print books are evidently very widely used by the visually impaired. If type size weren&rsquo;t important for this population they wouldn&rsquo;t use the large-print books.</p>

<p>Even that small sans are better for deciphering (slowly) than small serifs makes sense. But as they say, the key thing is large letters and high contrast. Once the letters are large enough to read, rather than simply decipher, I would suspect that the same preference for serifed faces in extended text holds as in the normally sighted world.</p>
<p>The best testing on legibility that I know of has been for <a href="http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/index.php">James Montalbano&rsquo;s Clearview Highway font</a>. It went beyond the photoshop blur test, and did testing under highway conditions. It does confirm the idea that open counters are a plus for legibility, at least for signage.</p>

I have two longtime friends who developed macular degeneration (they don’t know each other). I knew them when they both had healthy vision as well. One of them is almost totally blind now and the other is severely limited. At some point along there loss of vision path, both of them began needing large-print to be able to read. One was an editor and the other an illustrator/graphic designer. The graphics person was more cognizant of type than the editor and was able to communicate more specifically about it to me. She mentioned specifically liking sans serif more as her vision got worse. The editor was less specific. She said “plainer” type was easier for her. Both said they liked more letterspacing than before and larger size was a must.
Again, this is not scientific evidence and only addresses observations by two people with only one form of visual impairment. I am hoping that some real research is done by trained scientists in this area so that the laymen does not make assumptions which may seem logical to them but are not in evidence.</p>

The shadey Sheedy study, one and the same.</p>
<p>This study admits that size is a critical aspect of readability, but maketh not attempt to normalize the x-hts of Verdana and Arial to the same size when presented to the reader&hellip; does it? so, the subjects like the smaller sizes of Verdana (because theya re bgger than Arial), and the larger sizes of Helvetica (becasue they are smaller than Verdana), now don&rsquo;t they? big deal, unless you are interested in the effects of optical scaling, which we are not in this study&hellip;.</p>
<p>In addition, the two fonts are not hinted equally and neither is hinted well, (except for WYSIWYG applications). Do you understand that? This study was not typographically peer-reviewed and it is of little, bordering on no, practical use, except as I have implied, for testing optical scaling, and the uses that you might put to it.</p>
<p>Do you want me to go on to the next test?</p>

<p>With that in mind, I think I&rsquo;ll rename my foundry &ldquo;Readability Fonts&rdquo;.
All the fonts are of course designed for readabiity (none for unreadability) and backed up with statements from various authorities stating that,
&ldquo;Sans serif faces are more readable&rdquo; (for the sans faces)
&ldquo;Serif faces aere more readable&rdquo; (for the serif faces)
&ldquo;large x-height faces are more readable&rdquo; (for the large x-height faces)
&ldquo;small x-height faces are more readable&rdquo; (for the small x-height faces)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, I&rsquo;m sorry you find Sheedy&rsquo;s research inadequate. I think his work is excellent. My team has sponsored much of his work and we provide him with research, engineering, and typographic consulting.</p>
<p>I ask that you reread his work for I think you missed a few points. Table 1, which takes up much of page 801, shows the conversion between point size and the number of pixels of lowercase height and uppercase height for each of 6 fonts. He presents data both in terms of nominal size and pixels used.</p>
<p>Page 803: &ldquo;Results calibrated to font size (FS in Figure 2) show Verdana has the best legibility for both capital letters and for words, Times New Roman (TNR) has the worst, and the other two are in between. When the results are normalized for letter size (LS in Figure 2), Verdana continues to have the best capital letter and lowercase word legibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This work is much more interesting than a comparison between typefaces. Sheedy demonstrates that letter legibility is greater than word legibility (named the letter superiority effect). Lateral inhibition in the retina is the likely cause for this - essentially that neighboring letters makes letter feature recognition more difficult.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Sheedy demonstrates that letter legibility is greater than word legibility (named the letter superiority effect).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legibility in the Sheedy study amounts to discrimination affordance at thresholds of size. Sheedy demonstrates that discrimination affordance at threshold sizes is greater for isolated letters than for letters in words. If reading performance is a curve that rises steeply from a threshold and than hits a plateau, then these tests say something about letter identification at threshold sizes, but nothing about the height of the plateau, and it&rsquo;s extent. It might be argued that the plateau is the domain of readability and visual wordform resolution affordance.</p>
<p>This means that the comparison of the four fonts used, Arial, Verdana, Times New Roman and Georgia is in terms of relative discrimination affordance at thresholds of size in terms of letter identification when letters stand alone and when letters are in the context of words.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the task (to identify at thresholds) forces the subject to revert to a letter by letter processing routine, thus bringing into play the inhibitory force of contour interference. (Contour here means somthing more like &lsquo;adjacent stroke of flanking letter&rsquo; than what is meant by contour in a vector description environment.)</p>
<p>If lateral inhibition or contour interaction is the likely cause of the poorer performance on words, then the results suggest there is an interaction of font and amount of lateral inhibition or contour interaction. And this is different when fonts are compared by assigned font size versus absolute letter size in pixels!</p>
<p>Also, uppercase was used in the isolated conditions and lower case was used in the letters in words condition, but the cap height was normalized to the height of the lower case x-height in the letter size comparisons.</p>

Thanks, but it is an inevitable consequence of our script and language that neighboring letters be there. That letters need to be properly and consistently formed, and that words be formed from these kinds of letters is a given for me.</p>

<p>In terms of the curve mentioned above (rises steeply from a threshold and than hits a laterally extended plateau), this is like applying the results calculated at the base of the steep rise for one task (letter identification under two conditions) to what happens on the plateau for another (visual wordform resolution)!</p>
<p>Sheedy of course admits his generalizations require confirmation.</p>

<p>In the Microsoft video on ClearType, it was revealed that the project was greenlighted by Bill Gates on the proviso that measurable results be obtained. That&rsquo;s understandable, the boss is an engineer; but it leads to a situation that ties font development to reading research in a way where each channels the other, resulting in &ldquo;go faster&rdquo; fonts and the privileging of the contextually-divorced notion of speed as the main criterion of readability.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d just like to add one more point for this argument&hellip;</p>
<p>This of course, based on why we study typography to begin with.</p>
<p>When we were in school, learning how to read with our primers, we learned to recognize the printed LETTER. Most primers from Uncle Remus to Dick and Jane were set in Century Schoolbook - with yes, slab serifs &ndash; to help our little eyes grow more accustomed to the set word.</p>
<p>As we grow older - we find it is still EASIER for reading large paragraphs (body text) in a serif typeface.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this was in a type book - where the same headline - set in both San Serif and Serif - were cut in half - and only the top half of the letters shown. 10 out of 10 people had no problem figuring out what the words were from the Serif typeface &ndash; can&rsquo;t say that about the san serif.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and Arial is definitely a San Serif!!! LOL</p>

Testing both letters in isolation and letters in the context of words was a natural outcome of believing that both are important. We were surprised by the letter superiority effect when it showed up in the first study. I even asked it the numbers had been accidently switched as the finding is counterintuitive since it goes against the word superiority effect. It wasn’t until the effect was replicated in further studies that Sheedy realized that this was an important finding.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter wrote “It could be argued that the task (to identify at thresholds) forces the subject to revert to a letter by letter processing routine, thus bringing into play the inhibitory force of contour interference.”</p>
<p>Sheedy does use a threshold size methodology to demonstrate that lowercase letter legibility is greater than lowercase word legibility. The crowding effect is certainly more pronounced at smaller sizes, but has also been demonstrated to appear at larger sizes (e.g. typical eye charts). Peter, your critique is sound, but can you propose a way of testing for the existence of an unparsimonious secondary processing routine? Your model would be more compelling if it accounted for more of the data in the literature.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kevin the &lsquo;more parsimonious&rsquo; &lsquo;primary&rsquo; route requires an <em>ad hoc</em> post-perceptual-processing work-around with a fairly high computational load (especially if wickel-coding is correct), and some highly controversial assumptions&ndash;like that recognition is mediated by &lsquo;abstract&rsquo; letter codes&ndash;to explain an effect that might be more economically explained in perceptual processing terms, using the notions of 1) the word being a vector over a distinctive pattern of distinctive features, and 2) rhythmic spacing inhibiting &lsquo;componential abstraction.&rsquo; (1) is an assumption that has not been fully implimented in neural net models, and there is some evidence for (2). And &lsquo;crowding&rsquo; (the terms need further refinement) is part of the story.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;if it accounted for more of the data in the literature&rsquo; is a bit of a red herring, since I believe my model accounts for, or is consistent with, at least as much of the data in the literature. Only, I have not explicitly specified precisely how in relation to each data set.</p>
<p>So this needs to be more systematically specified, but one and the same data set can support divergent conclusions if it doesn&rsquo;t distinguish sufficiently between relevant options, or keep them all in play or ubder consideration. This is I think what happens. And each account encounters areas of dark matter that it has trouble sorting out. Mine is results illcited by cross-case masked priming.</p>
<p>Indeed, I or we need to devise a series of conclusive tests. Bill and others call for this as well, and maybe we can come up with some.</p>
