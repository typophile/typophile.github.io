body: "I want to describe an 'idea' I had for a tool to be implemented.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea is to have a tool for generating shapes in that order:\r\nyou give the tool
  a 'counter' an a set of 'rules'\r\nthe tool apply the 'rules' to the counter and
  generate the final shape.\r\n\r\nIn the image below the rules are represented as
  vectors that map points on the inner contour to points on the outer contour. If
  the rules are changed the outer shape change, accordingly, if the 'counter' is changed
  the same rules generate another shape (in my image you see the difference of scaling
  the counter and scaling the resultant shape.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/counters_5621.gif]\r\n\r\nTo
  test the concept I've written a script (too ugly to show) in python and, using fontforge
  (as a python module), I generated a 'font' (actually three letters: I'm lazy).\r\n\r\nThe
  script roughly performs the things I've described (it takes a shapes \u2013 the
  counter \u2013 and a set of rules for each node, and outputs the glyph). \r\nWhile
  I was trying to write this script I realized that everything could be parametrized,
  so that you can make changes manipulating 'meaningful' parameters. The 'rules' can
  be as well thought as functions that respond to inputs from that parameters, and
  at the end you have two elastic boundaries tied together by some law.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally
  you can reuse a counter, transform it and attach new rules to define another glyph,
  etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow you can see some test:\r\nchanging the 'offset' (i.e. changing
  the stem width)\r\nchanging the width of counters\r\ntesting for extreme cases (almost
  Klimax-esque)\r\nchanging the defined 'contrast' parameter (horizontal/vertical
  offsets)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/variation_4865.jpg]\r\n\r\nEvery
  variation required only one or two parameters to be modified."

  body: "The idea of applying (variable) vectors to counters (i.e. generating \u2018counter
    points\u2019) to represent (combinations of) certain contrast sorts (\u2018translation\u2019,
    \u2018expansion\u2019, [\u2018transpansion\u2019, \u2018exlation\u2019]), contrast
    flows (vector length, angle and rotation) and contrast as an alternative to the
    more traditional (and in some cases questionable) approach of applying the same
    effects to a \u2018skeleton\u2019 or \u2018heart\u2019 line is interesting, but
    also raises a few questions.\r\n\r\nThe three letters shown are simplified forms,
    because the counters don't provide any information about the stems top left. This
    seems to limit the possible variants to the presented ones. At the other hand
    there is the descender of the \u2018p\u2019, which is not described by the counter
    itself. I am also curious about how letters with multiple counters , like \u2018a\u2019
    and \u2018e\u2019 will be handled by this system. \r\n\r\nThe counter oriented
    model also seems to exclude serifs by definition, and assuming that serifs are
    an indicator/representation of the contrast sort, contrast flow and, of course,
    the contrast (not to mention the relation to the \u2018stem interval\u2019), this
    seems to limit the system to letters with low contrast. The relatively high contrast
    pointed pen (\u2018expansion\u2019) variants (bottom left) require for instance
    serifs in my opinion."

  body: "Ok, now I made some observation about this.\r\nFirst: the idea came in my
    mind while I was reading Smeijers Counterpunch\r\nTo make things clearer (I suspect
    that one thing that makes my writing unclear is my funny english): what happens
    if drawing a glyph you are <em>forced</em> to draw the 'counterpunch' first?\r\nMoreover,
    what if you the only thing you can really define is the counterpunch itself? Now
    you have a shape (te counterpunch) and you need to draw something around it in
    a different way. I discovered that you can do that by saying: move this point
    on the counter in such a way, move the other point etc.\r\n\r\nThis is what I
    meant with the first image. The inner shape is the counterpunch and the arrows
    are the displacements that 'generate' the outer contour.\r\n\r\n(I call the displacements
    \"rules\" because I needed to generalize the concept.)\r\n\r\nThen I realized
    that this kind of constraint (drawing the counterpunch and then defining displacements
    to generate the other contour) was very useful to define a parametric glyph.\r\nFor
    example, the displacement of the lateral point of the counter of lowercase o is
    related to the weight of the glyph. And the displacement of the points in lowercase
    n, define the 'stem'. And the relation between the two displacement I mentioned
    is the difference of straight line to curves etc. \r\n\r\nSecond:\r\nAt this point
    for me there is a conceptual problem: because if you 'parametrize' something you
    have to parametrize almost everything (the reason is clear when you think at the
    relation between horizontal and vertical: if the horizontals change with the verticals,
    you can: a. change the height of the counter (i.e. parametrize this as well) or
    b. change the x-height of the glyph.)\r\n<em>But this move blurs the difference
    between drawing glyph in this way and drawing the usual way</em> (again, the vertical
    proportions problem)\r\n\r\nThird:\r\nThis tool is very impractical since you
    can do the same thing with interpolation etc. Moreover I really cannot see any
    way to trasform my awful python script into something more functional, like a
    software with a graphic interface etc. (here the problem is also being a really
    unskilled programmer).\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for you comment Frank,\r\nI drawn the simplified shapes because it
    is much easier :) but I made also other experiments with serifs etc:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serif1_6257.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serif2_5505.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen
    I said that every point in the counter is mapped to a point in the contour I was
    imprecise: you can generate 0, 1 or even more than one point, i.e. you can attach
    more than one 'rule' to a point.\r\nBut this way of defining descender and ascender
    is impractical: In the examples I used more than one \"counter\" (notice also
    that I have closed and open counters), the descender being a line (this is cheating
    I know).\r\n\r\nTo draw serifs I decided to also have simple contour (parametrized
    as well) that I can attach to the glyph (again this is cheating.)\r\n(Yes, the
    glyphs have overlapping contours at the end, but my 'tool' is just a way to experiment,
    not a way to really draw a real font)\r\n\r\nedit: you can see the overlapping
    in the images.\r\n\r\nBeing a piece of software you can also write a conditional
    statement to attach serifs when, for example, the contrast is greater than a threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is when you have serifs and 'multiple' counters, but it is interesting because
    this 'force' you to see things from a different angle.\r\nI'm not sure if it is
    a way to draw quickly, you have to carefully 'plan' your shapes, maybe avoiding

    benefits. If a type designer could articulate the \"permissions\" or aspects of
    a typeface to a developer such as Daniele through the design of a few key glyphs,
    who could then develop an algorithm to produce an entire character set, production
    time (and profits as a result) could improve significantly. Granted, there would
    need to be some review and tweaking by the type designer. \r\n\r\nIf we wanted
    to be altruistic, we could pass the cost-savings back to our clients who could
    then re-invest their resources into other things like solar panels. \r\n\r\nI
    have a small amount of experience collaborating with a python developer in an
    effort to design a typeface so I know it's possible, but I am not familiar enough
    with the business of type design to know it it is actually practical (or profitable)
    but you never know until you try.\r\n\r\nRegardless of it's potential practicality,
    I think it worthy of exploration. I look forward to the results.\r\n\r\n(does
