  to my mind is charming.  New Orleans is filled with buildings, gardens, statues,
  murals, and signs that are both creative and visually pleasing.  This blog gives
  a few examples of the various types of signage found in the city and shows how they
  vary in design but are still effective as identification markers.\r\n\r\nOut of
  the four pictures, I think that the sign marking the Carousel Gardens in City Park
  is probably the most native New Orleans in design.  The wrought iron decor is definitely
  a staple of New Orleans and is found all over the city.  Both the Botanical Gardens
  and the New Orleans Museum of Art signs are fairly plain but extremely substantial.
  \ They are easily readable and probably can withstand New Orleans weather.  The
  Boh Bros sign is creative in that in resembles a setting or rising sun, depending
  on how you interpret it.  The combination of the thick and thin sans serif lettering
  is very eye-catching and shows the hierarchy of the text effectively.  Although
  all of these signs differ in looks, they all are appropriately designed for the
  function they are meant to fill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/carouselgardenssign_4310.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/botanicalgardenssign_4507.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nomasign_5157.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bohbrotherssign_6321.jpg]"
