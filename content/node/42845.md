  forum and posted questions, I've been in awe of the expertise here. \r\n\r\nI'm
  a graphic designer and I spend more time on another professional forum that has
  spoiled me with fast responses to my posts.\r\n\r\nMay I direct traffic to my query
  in the Design section? I'm OCD and I'm wearing out the refresh button. If this is
  bad form, please smack me and I won't do it again. Thank you!"

  body: I'm sorry! If I could remove this post I would. The other forum is much more
    lax about this sort of thing, so please forgive me. Won't do it again.
