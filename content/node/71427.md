  body: I think that's Kufi Standard, which I think is included with Apple OS X, but
    it's probably for sale as single font as well.

  body: thank you queneau. yes it's very similar(but not quite the same) to kufi standard
    which is a standard OS X font. I tried to install that font on a PC, but was unsuccessful.
    Which is weird, as i thought .ttf fonts worked on both platforms. I just looked
    and can't find one for sale anywhere, there seem to be many versions of kufi fonts
    but they are a little more flowery/decorative than this version.
