  body: Yes, there are some similar swash alternates in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/adobe_garamond_expert_collection/">Adobe
    Garamond Expert</a>. Though I recommend getting the OpenType <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Adobe%20Garamond%20Pro">Adobe
    Garamond Pro</a> for much easier use.

    might also be an option. It also has all kinds of swash chars.
