  at a loss.  Matching the C and B seem to be impossible.  Thank you.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4746.jpg]

  body: Hard to say with so few letters and in such a condition but taking in consideration
    /C and /S terminals angle looks rather parallel to baseline would confirm your
    hunch for Helvetica/Helvetica Neue (the 2 versions are different). [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-haas-grotesk|Neue
    Haas Grotesk]] would work as long as many other Helvetica clones/digitizations/reinterpretations
    like URW++ [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans|Nimbus Sans]], Paratype
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/pragmatica|Pragmatica]], Scangraphic [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh|Europa
    Grotesk]], Bitstream [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721|Swiss
    721]]...

    body: "That was the problem I was running into.  I can find the same C, with the
      narrow opening, but every font that has it uses a B that is offset top and bottom.
      \ The fonts with a symmetrical B have a C with a wider and non-horizontal closing.
      \ It's driving me up the wall!\r\n\r\nRight now I have a composite of Helvetica
      Neue LT Standard for the AC and S... but I have to use Helvetica Standard for
      the B.  It's the closest I have gotten to the original font. "
