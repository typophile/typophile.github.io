body: I've een this font around, but haven't been able to find it. The letter A is
  obviously the most identifiable feature, but I still can't put a (type)face to a
  name. Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

  body: Can't find a match. It'd probably be easier with the sample origin btw. For
    the rest, if you're not after a match, "[[http://experimentalsans.tumblr.com/|I
    AM SO TIRED OF YOUR EXPERIMENTAL SANS]] is, as suggested by Frode, a nice inspirational
    kingdom. There are also some more at [[http://tendollarfonts.com|Ten Dollar Fonts]].
