  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I started a thread about a year ago : <a href="http://typophile.com/node/18054">http://typophile.com/node/18054</a> Monitor Calibration. At the time I wasn&rsquo;t really concerned with calibrating in regards to printing. Things have changed and I&rsquo;m working on dual monitors and outputting often to a laser printer. I want to be able to calibrate both monitors and the printer to get exact colors (or as close as possible.) The dual monitor set up is a 17 inch CRT and a 17 inch LCD. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible to match them exactly or not.</p>
<p>From what was mentioned in the earlier topic, I looked into the <a href="http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=108&ca=2">Pantone Eye-one Display 2</a> and the <a href="http://www.colorvision.com/product-mc-s2p.php">ColorVision Spyder2Pro</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious which these would meet (and exceed) my needs? Do any of you have any experience using them, are they easy to set up and is the software simple and intuitive? Are there any alternative solutions?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ive got the color vision spyder 2 pro. Keeping it calibrated and using the correct profiles is huge. It really helps with high end inkjet photo printing. I have not been printing as much recently. I brought the spyder in to callibrate my dual PC monitors at work and it also helped. Though loading the profile was a little trickier. CRT and LCD might be hard to match together, but you can certainly callibrate both profiles to be as good as corrected or &ldquo;true&rdquo; as possible.</p>
<p>Im interested to hear others responses on the Huey. . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a CRT at work and an LCD at home. They are a different beast. I much prefer the LCD for both sharpness and accuracy. Regarding matching them&ndash;you can get them reasonable but don&rsquo;t expect an exact match. I would be more concerned with how your printer matches and how the measured values on a PDF match than getting both screens perfect. Decide on which screen will be your final match best (for me LCD) and use that with your printer. Printers are the tricky ones with so many variables. I also use the Colorvision. The first time you use it is the hardest. After that, you know the drill. If I really want to test tricky cmyk color builds, I send it out to a good proofing house.</p>

<p>Is it possible to set up profiles to match my commercial printer&rsquo;s equipment? What would I need to ask for for that?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ask them for a profile or which profile you should be using. If you have a regular printer they&rsquo;re usually very good about such things. It&rsquo;s very possible they&rsquo;re using something as mundane as US Coated SWOP (v2).</p>
<p>You can get both your monitors calibrated but really you should rely on one most of the time.  Pick the best one and go with that. Let the other be a pallette monitor.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I use a Huey at home and it does a great job correcting the blue-cast that is endemic to Dell notebook displays; it&rsquo;s simple to use and sits unobtrusively on my desk to take 30-second readings of ambient light. The problem, of course, is that it is only capable of one profile, so my dual-monitor set up can either be calibrated for my external LCD or my notebook display, but not distinct profiles for each (I should have shucked out the dollars for a calibrator that could handle 2 displays).</p>
<p>As for printers, I&rsquo;ve attempted a number of times to sort out printer calibration and every time it makes my head hurt. If anyone has a link to a good and reasonable tutorial on this, I&rsquo;d be much indebted.</p>
