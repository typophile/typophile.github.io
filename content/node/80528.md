body: "So a couple of years ago, I made my first font, Yagi Double. Then I wanted
  to hint it, got scared when I saw the amount of work involved. Now I'm ready to
  try again but it STILL seems too tedious, like I'm missing something. What I've
  read so far on the subject:\r\nhttp://www.rastertragedy.com/\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=NotesOnHintingWithFL\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
  I understand it, you come up with an array of numbers representing the location
  of stuff like the baseline, cap height, x-height, etc. You feed these into two different
  areas in Fontlab. With an inline font like this, there are twice as many of these
  numbers. It's a lot of hassle.\r\n\r\n1. Does this really produce good hinting results
  at the end, if I could force myself to do it properly?\r\n\r\n2. Is there no way
  I can just manually edit the post-hinting outline for each letter? Like drag the
  vector points around until they neatly box in the pixels? I can [[http://creedo.gbgl-hq.com/hinting.jpg|SEE
  this outline on the screen]], but I can't seem to manipulate it. Is it unrealistic
  to think I could just manually tweak 52ish characters for every font size between,
  say, 8 and 18 points?\r\n\r\n3. If I can't do it this way in fontlab, can I somehow
  do it in illustrator and import the result into fontlab, like \"use this vector
  outline as my 8pt version of zero\"?\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated."

  body: "You shouldn't need that many values... for an all-caps display font like
    this you can probably get away with defining alignment zones for just the baseline
    and cap height, and standard stem values for the width/height of the main stroke
    and the inline. Add those to the hinting area in Font Info, then import the zones
    in the TT Hinting Options (the \"...\" button on the panel in hinting mode).\r\n\r\nOne
    way of hinting a glyph like the zero (a relatively simple example): Start in vertical
    mode and add anchors to points at the top and bottom of the glyph (which should
    automatically attach to the alignment zones), then drag a single link from each
    of those anchored points up/down to the inside of the first contour (these should
    automatically link to the stem value for the stroke), from there add another single
    link across the inline (which should automatically link to the stem value for
    the inline), and finally to the inside of the interior stroke.\r\n\r\nIn horizontal
    mode, add an anchor to the left sidebearing, from there drag a single link to
    the left side of the glyph (holding Shift to keep from automatically setting a
    stem value), then an auto-value single link across the main stroke, the inline
    and the inner stroke. Shift-drag a no-value single link across the inside counter,
    then continue with automatic single links to the right side of the glyph, finishing
    with a no-value link to the right sidebearing.\r\n\r\nIt's these zones, stem values,
    anchors, links, etc. that are stored inside of the font as \"hinting.\" The interpolated
    post-hinting outlines that you see in FontLab are created on-the-fly based on
    that info, which is why there's no way to adjust the outline; it's generated from
    the current hinting program and displayed as a visual aid to help you understand
    how the points and outlines are being affected to create the bitmap.\r\n\r\nUsing
    the freeware Yagi-like font <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/retro-stereo-wide.font\">Retro
    Stereo Wide</a> as an example, here's how the hinted zero appears alongside the
    other un-hinted numerals (Windows XP Grayscale rendering with smoothing to all
    sizes):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zero-hint_5324.png]&nbsp;\r\nThe
    increased sharpness and definition seems fairly evident, up to a point; whether
    the difference is drastic enough to warrant manually hinting such a font is...
    perhaps less so. The double stroke will give you a headache on glyphs like B,
    E, S, etc. Maybe fill the inline and practice on that first.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nVertical
    hints (11ppem/8pt):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zero-hint-vertical_4420.png]&nbsp;\r\nHorizontal
    hints (11ppem/8pt):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zero-hint-horizontal_4935.png]\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI'm kind of bummed out actually, someone else released their own version
    of Yagi Double, and it looks pretty good (even unhinted). And it has more characters
    that I've bothered to do. At this point hinting any size would be a training exercise
    only.\r\n\r\nGargoyle: holy crap, you're the man, or possibly woman! You took
    the time to not only answer fully but to even provide visuals. This info is exactly
    what I was hoping for. I'm gonna go play with it right now and see if I can figure
    it out as thoroughly as you seem to have. I have my 2nd-ever effort underway,
    might as well hint that."
