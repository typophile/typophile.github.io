  is a tough, sophisticated sans, named for prolific maritime architect William Francis
  Gibbs and inspired by his greatest design, the record-breaking mid-century luxury
  liner SS <em>United States</em>. Taking various cues from the unique cast aluminum
  signs found on board, the result is truly transatlantic \u2014 somewhere in between
  industrial American vernacular lettering and the English humanist styles of Gill
  or Johnston. Both stylish and comfortable to read, and with an extensive list of
  OpenType features, Gibbs allows you to set quality type with ease at both text and
  display sizes.\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1952, the beautiful <em>United States</em> was the
  most revolutionary ship in the world when new. After a flawless 17-year career,
  she now sits unused and is in danger of scrapping. Her current owner, the non-profit
  SS United States Conservancy, wishes to restore the ship as a vibrant waterfront
  development and museum for future generations to enjoy for decades to come.\r\n\r\nYou
  can purchase Gibbs at [[http://bit.ly/GibbsFont|MyFonts]]. I've also attached a
  [[http://typophile.com/files/GibbsTypeSample_sm.pdf|PDF Specimen]] with some more
  sample settings and some history about the ship and notes about the design."
