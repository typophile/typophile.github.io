  body: "I\u2019m only on season 3 (1963). What year is this supposed to be for?\r\n\r\nIn
    season 3 Roger Sterling is getting sidelined. On top this makes Sterling and Partners
    more important than Cooper. Was there a turnabout and Cooper, the wily one, got
    the short-shrift instead?"

  body: The stencil, the ampersand, and the Eurostile each seem period-evocative,
    but in different, and not really harmonious, ways. Like if you wanted a seventies
    movie poster and I produced Vito Corleone fending off a great white shark with
    a light saber.

  body: I think, by itself the "Sterling Cooper" looks pretty good, so does "and partners".
    The ampersand looks nearly classy. What's with the mismatched terminals? Was that
    once popular?
