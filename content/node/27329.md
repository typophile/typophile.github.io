body: "One of my friends comissioned me to make a logo for his organic food imports
  company. Basically the idea is that its a combination of organics and nicaragua,
  so it's called Organ\xEDca. Innitially he wanted me to do something that looked
  like OrgaNica or orgaNICA to make the distinction between the terms clear, but i
  got him away from that style of blunt information. So this is what i've come up
  with so far. Im not sure how i feel about it and im not sure if i like the two colored
  leaves or just one. Any feedback would be much appreciated"

  body: Also i forgot to point out, in the top one the text is slightly heavier than
    the other three. I thought the text overall looked a little too heavy compared
    to the leaves (if you stand back you'll see it), but I couldnt think of a better
    way to fix that. Im not totally happy with the thinned out text on the lower ones,
    i dont think its thin enough to balance, but if i thin it more it looks worse.
    I couldnt think of a good way to make the leaves bolder.

  body: Personally, I'd go with the first option. The double leaves sort of wrap around
    each other, giving a feeling of warmth and trust, while a single lonely leaf is
    just that, a single lonely leaf. Also, in my opinion, having the leaves next to
    the name makes it feel a bit tacked on, almost as an afterthought, while putting
    them on top of the 'i' makes them feel a bit more integrated. The difference isn't
    that great, and there is something to be said for having it on the same line as
    the text. There's something about the leaf design itself that puts me off a bit,
    though. Maybe you could look at some other leaf shapes to see if you can find
    some other forms that work well.

  body: hm. Yeah pretty much everyone has been telling me the two leaves, and i think
    i agree with you on that. As for the right side or on top, I was sort of worried
    that on top of the I it looked like a logo that i'd seen too many times before....
    maybe im screwed either way on that though. I've been trying to fix the leaf with
    other shapes. one friend suggested turning it into a curved leaf, like one folded
    over on itself, but it didnt look right, and started to need too many colors for
    my liking.. also it wouldnt fit with there being two leaves now.. but ill keep
    experimenting with more involved leaf shapes

    considered trying it with two-story <cite>a</cite> and <cite>g</cite> characters?
    That might help to balance out what might be an overabundance of wide-open counters."

    it still looks too complicated. it kinda destroys the simplicity of the whole

    seems so common. but im not sure where to go anymore. i guess ill keep playing"

  body: "A smaller top bowl for the g with a wider (and slightly taller) bottom bowl
    and an angled ear like the bottom serif on the a might help, the curve of the
    n seems a bit steep at about 2 o'clock and the lefthand side of the o seems to
    have a kink in it. I like the double leaf but the darker one looks a bit strange
    not being symmetrical.\r\nTim\r\n<em>Edit bit of a cross-post going on, I still
    prefer a two storey g because it is more of an organic shape</em>"

  body: "First of all, I think the overall idea works, and I like the two leaves.
    Number one is also my preference.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that if there's one
    thing here that can be improved, it's the choice of typeface. I find this face
    very \"inorganic\" -- no modulation, no torque, too \"mathematical\". I think
    the face should feel natural, and this one feels artificial to me.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a <em>very</em> quick rework using Cronos. This is just to try and make my point;
    I'm not suggesting you use Cronos.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/organica_6291.png]"

    one might give it sort of an asian flare, so maybe it wont work, which is fine,
    you said you werent suggesting it anyway, but it doest make the point.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I think the leaves still need some work. The top leaf ends at too fine of
    a point at the top. It will disappear at any size smaller than what has been shown.

    smaller leaves, for use above a certain size; the other, just like 1B small, for
    small sizes.\r\n\r\nThe face still doesn't look very organic to me. Just brainstorming

    the organic and not perfectly computerish style, maybe more so than the rest of

    rest of the letters... or the rest of the letters more like the n and c.
