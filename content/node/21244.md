body: "Hi there, please someone help me. I am going crazy and loosing faith in InDesign.
  \r\n\r\nI have a document where I have made a set of paragraph styles. I have another
  document that I am copying and pasting text from. Now... when I select the text
  box and then select the paragraph style I want it doesnt complete change all the
  specs. Eg, it might change the colour but not the actual typeface, or point size.
  The paragrapg style still shows the little + sign by the side of it. SOmetimes it
  is obvious what is wrong but when it is not it is really annoying to try and find
  it. \r\n\r\nI thought that by just selecting the right para style it would change
  the block of text. It gets quite annoying when you have to change every single block
  of text manually. Surely this defeats the object of paragraph styles. \r\n\r\nPlease,
  for the love of god, someone help me..\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My guess, without actually firing up InDesign, is that the original doc has
    local formatting, for example Normal style is 12 pt Times, and some one has changed
    the typeface and point size \"by hand\", ie not changing the style sheet. If you
    go into your original document, and change the style so it matches the actual
    point size and typeface, you might avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nOne of the many
    reasons I still prefer Quark, where problem workarounds are generally easier to
    figure out.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "First off, usually when copying and pasting text into a styled paragraph,
    I like to use the \"Paste Without Formatting\" (Command + Shift + V), which will
    automatically assign paragraph attributes to the pasted text. This will also prevent
    styles from other documents from being imported.\r\n\r\nSecond, the \"little +
    sign\" means the style is unpure, in this because it's maintaining attributes
    from its original document. You can make the paragraph pure again simply by Option-clicking
    the style."

  body: If you hold down the Option key (and I assume the Alt key in Windows will
    work the same way) when you click on the paragraph style, then the style's settings
    will override any other settings applied to the text. (The +plus sign indicates
    that the current settings of the selected text do not match the specs of the current
    style.)

    it to have. \r\n\r\n- Select the paragraph\r\n- Holding the OPT key down, double-click
    on the style\r\n\r\nThis should work."

    more familiar with InDesign. Workarounds are generally easy to figure out once
    you understand how the app works."

    body: Until I can get InDesign tags to be as useful as Quark tags, and have the
      same control of kerning, I dont think I'll be happy with InDesign, in spite
      of its many good features.

  body: "HI there, \r\n\r\nThe Option Key sorted out the problem. THanks for that
    everyone. Seems as though InDesign need to sort out the hirachy of things like
    that. It should just be a simple click of the button, but I guess we all have
    our own ways of working\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Matt, there is a clear hierarchy, outlined in the InDesign help file.\r\n\r\nWhen
    applying styles, here's how to control what InDesign does with existing formatting:\r\n\r\n-
    To apply a paragraph style and preserve character styles, but remove overrides,
    hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) as you click the name of the style
    in the Paragraph Styles palette.\r\n\r\n- To apply a paragraph style and remove
    both character styles and overrides, hold down Alt+Shift (Windows) or Option+Shift
    (Mac OS) as you click the name of the style in the Paragraph Styles palette."

    to disregard style when pasting text from other applications.
