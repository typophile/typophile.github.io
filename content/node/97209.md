  body: "You won't be able to display the boxed SP with a font, I think.\r\n\r\nThese
    two are easy, and you should find quite a few fonts that support the simple Unicode
    characters:\r\n\u0251 U+0251\r\n\u2116 U+2116\r\n\r\nThe d with a hacek above
    is a bit trickier. This is best attempted using a lowercase d with a combining
    hacek mark (U+030C), but software may normalise this as U+010F -- \u010F --, which
    has a different form. This is because this is the conventional display of d+hacek
    in two European orthographies that use the diacritic, Czech and Slovak."

  body: Yes, the Unicode glyph charts make use of specialised fonts to display visual
    representations of control characters and other normally non-visible entities.
    They are also built using a custom piece of software, which means they avoid the
    default layout behaviours of typical text processing apps when dealing with these
    characters.

    there is the SYMBOL FOR SPACE Character (U+2420) \u201C\u2420\u201D. Its look
    depends on the typeface.\r\nI see it in Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode
    and Apple Symbols on my machine.\r\n"

    you that before posting the question I spent almost an hour trying to find the
    character \u0251 U+0251 in the code charts, to no avail.\r\n2. Bob, the trick
    with the Combining Grapheme Joiner worked beautifully in Calibri.\r\n3. Ralf,
    unfortunately the characteres U+2420 and U+20DE (COMBINING ENCLOSING SQUARE) don't
    combine in Arial Unicode MS. In Lucida Sans Unicode, the glyph for the character
    U+2420 (\u2420) is even better, but the font doesn't have the code U+20DE."
