body: I teach a high school graphic design class.  It's unfortunate that my class
  only goes for one semester and there's so much to teach them!  I have to teach them
  design software on top of design principles which is a tricky to cram in without
  overloading them.  I unfortunately won't be able to teach them EVERYTHING about
  typography (sad!).  That being said, I was wondering if anyone knows any links to
  typeface/font lessons or has any ideas?  I won't be able to cover everything but
  I'm looking to give them a solid foundation and have it be hands on and fun at the
  same time.  I am going to teach them basics of tracking, leading, point size, sans
  serif vs serif and a drizzling of the history of type to start, but I'd really like
  to tie this into a fun more hands on lesson and I'm drawing a blank.  I'd really
  like to do something on how fonts convey emotions but having them just type words
  in a font they think conveys it sounds kinda boring to me right now.  Any help would
  be MOST appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
