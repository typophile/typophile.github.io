    link you provided is why I think I found myself so baffled in determining what
    this was.  Again, thank you, I genuinely appreciate it."

  body: "Why would the font in the image above not be Silver Thread as seen here by
    Jason Walcott:\r\n\r\nhttp://marketplace.veer.com/type/JBT0000108\r\n\r\nI realize
    there is a good case for comparing hairline fonts to apples and oranges, but I
    would have to throw that Jukebox font into the mix as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/9az6t.png\r\n\r\nSo
    I don't know if this one is truly solved."

  body: "Silver Thread is a digital revival of L&C Hairline. I wish Jason Walcott/Jukebox
    would properly credit the sources. Likewise, the blurb for <a href=\"http://marketplace.veer.com/fonts/JBT0001065_Eloquent-Pro-Complete#\">Eloquent</a>
    doesn\u2019t mention Pistilli Roman. I wonder if it is a legal issue?"
