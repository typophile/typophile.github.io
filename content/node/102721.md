body: "Hi! I'm new to the forum, so thanks for helping me out. :)\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  hard for a font family for a new website project that is very similar to Museo Sans,
  but that is a little simpler like Avenir Next. I like Museo Sans because it has
  some personality, but I like the simplicity of a geometric sans like Avenir Next.
  Futura is way too geometric and \"Intro\" font is too stylized. \r\n\r\nI don't
  want to settle on Proxima Nova because it's way overused even though it's a nice
  font. Some other ones I really like are: <a href=\"http://arstype.angusrshamal.com/ars-maquette-2\">ARS
  Maquette</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/effra/\">Effra</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/soleil/\">Soleil</a>, and <a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/\">Gibson</a>.\r\n\r\nDo you
  guys have any suggestions? "
