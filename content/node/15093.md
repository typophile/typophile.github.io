  deep historical roots in Portugal. The company is an equestrian company, which is
  very well known in the equestrian world. The majority of the company is now based
  in the US, but the leagacy is very portuguese.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I should
  take into consideration when considering a typographic system?\r\nSomething that
  had historical roots would be appropriate, but something like a display face recently
  developed by a portuguese type designer might not.\r\n\r\nIdeas? Considerations?
  Thoughts?"

    cultural identity. His Lisboa face (available through Veer) has a dingbat component
    with a decidedly Portuguese flavor. And when Stephen gets out from under the mound
    of things to do :-) we'll hopefully hear more about it...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Feliciano's Garda and historical revivals, especially Rongel, I would think
    would prime candidates for the project. Also to be found at <a href="http://vllg.com">Village</>.

    what you are looking for, but he is a very helpful person who might be able to
    give you further hints for your search.\r\n\r\nChristian"
