  body: "The Five W method is helpful to give a structured explaination : \r\n\r\n\xB6
    Who is it about?\r\nIt's about communication & typography\r\n\r\n\xB6 What happened
    (what's the story)?\r\nThere is a lot of type classifications (Thibaudeau, Vox-ATyPi,
    Alessandrini) but they most focus on the look of the typefaces rather than on
    the use of the typefaces. Erik Spiekermann in \u201CStop Stealing Sheeps\u201D
    raises the question of a classification of type according to their purpose (cf.
    Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez, \u201COn type classifications\u201D, Gazette, Typofonderie,
    March 10th 2011)\r\nIn the same time, I had an opportunity to re-read the Jakobson
    scheme. Roman Jokobson is a American linguist, he studied the language according
    to six functions : \r\n\xA7 The Referential Function \r\ncorresponds to the factor
    of Context and describes a situation, object or mental state. The descriptive
    statements of the referential function can consist of both definite descriptions
    and deictic words, e.g. \"The autumn leaves have all fallen now.\"\r\n\xA7 The
    Expressive (alternatively called \"emotive\" or \"affective\") Function \r\nrelates
    to the Addresser and is best exemplified by interjections and other sound changes
    that do not alter the denotative meaning of an utterance but do add information
    about the Addresser's (speaker's) internal state, e.g. \"Wow, what a view!\"\r\n\xA7
    The Conative Function \r\nengages the Addressee directly and is best illustrated
    by vocatives and imperatives, e.g. \"Tom! Come inside and eat!\"\r\n\xA7 The Poetic
    Function \r\nfocuses on \"the message for its own sake\"[3] and is the operative
    function in poetry as well as slogans.\r\n\xA7 The Phatic Function \r\nis language
    for the sake of interaction and is therefore associated with the Contact factor.
    The Phatic Function can be observed in greetings and casual discussions of the
    weather, particularly with strangers.\r\n\xA7 The Metalingual (alternatively called
    \"metalinguistic\" or \"reflexive\") Function \r\nis the use of language (what
    Jakobson calls \"Code\") to discuss or describe itself. \r\n(see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakobson%27s_functions_of_language)\r\nSo
    I decided to mix Jakobson with \"Erix\" (Erik S.) hence \"Jax\"\r\n\r\n\xB6 Where
    did it take place?\r\nIt took place in France, because, in there, we love speculative/abstracts
    studies.\r\n\r\n\xB6 When did it take place?\r\nIt took place in 2011, because,
    from time to time, a type classification appears.\r\n\r\n\xB6 Why did it happen?\r\nIt
    happened because I wasn't satisfied with my reflexions about type licencing. So
    I wanted to go further : what's a typeface is for and in which case, people have
    to use it willingly or unwillingly.\r\n\r\n\xB6\xB6 So what? \r\nNothing, such
    a type classification is pointless from a \"graphic design\"/\"visual\" point
    of view.\r\nBut it could be useful to explain what typography means as a communication
    tool.\r\n\r\n\xB6\xB6 Some examples, just to be more concrete?\r\nYeah of course
    :\r\n- as a piece of art (A), a typeface is sometime expressive as such: e.g.
    a calligraphic typeface, a decorative titling typeface --- Zapfino, History, PF
    Champion\r\n- as a branding tool (B1), a typeface carries the message\r\n- as
    a default typeface (B2), a typeface is used in a word processor, in Gmail or in
    instant messaging application --- any preinstalled typeface, like Times New Roman
    or Arial for instance\r\n- as a full-featured workhorse design (B3), a typeface
    could be used for a book, a magazine, a website, etc. --- most commercial typefaces\r\n-
    for core applications, terminal, display, programming (C), a typeface is a interface
    --- courier, fixedsys, ms sans serif\r\n\r\n\xB6\xB6 Is there, however, a connection
    between function & aesthetics/licencing aspects\r\n\r\nYeah, possibly:\r\nA |
    calligraphics | copyright/copyleft | on-demand, self-made\r\nB1 | all classes
    | copyright | on-demand\r\nB2 | transitionnal, modern | copyright/copyleft | pre-paid\r\nB3

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm glad you love the word \"globomunication\" ;-)\r\n\r\nSome
    examples, sure :\r\n- expression : zapf chancery, zapfino, bickham script, and
    so on any typeface expressing a feeling in first place\r\n- message : gotham when
    used for obama campaign, helvetica, din\r\n- contact : arial widely used in e-mail
    applications, times new roman widely used in everyday life\r\n- public : garamond
    widely used in publishing, baskerville and caslon as well\r\n- code : courier
    is the best example, as a core system fonts in most of OSes\r\n\r\nI apply the
    classification to the fonts themselves, because, somehow, form is related to use.
    For instance, courier could hardly be a typeface for expression. Helvetica and
    Arial are very close, but do not belong to the same category, because the context
    and the people who are using them are different.\r\n\r\nM. a. a. n., I didn't
    know the abbreviation, so thanks you for giving me an opportunity to improve my
    english ;-)\r\nJax is possibly \"maan\" for type designers, but it could be useful
    for \"the rest of us\" in order to make understand what typefaces & typography
    actually is nowadays in the real life. Out there, most people use typefaces but
    do not see them ; they cannot distinguish every subtle forms but context of use
    is meaningful for them.\r\n"

  body: "Seeing the distinction between \"message\", \"contact\", and \"public\",
    I would have put Courier in the \"Message\" category - I'm still vague on what
    \"Code\" should mean. If it means simply a way to express the symbols of the alphabet
    without much subtext, that <em>can</em> apply to Caslon or Helvetica in the right
    context.\r\n\r\nSo what I'm seeing here is:\r\n\r\nExpression: Script and display
    typefaces - where the style of printing is intended to convey some type of \"feeling\".
    Comic Sans and Papyrus would go here too, along with Hobo, with the fonts that
    look like candy or balloons - but also much more respectable ones, Zapf Chancery
    being an example.\r\n\r\nMessage: This also seems to be a \"display\" category
    to a limited extent. Franklin Gothic seems to be what goes here - typefaces that
    are bold, but otherwise relatively plain.\r\n\r\nContact: If Times New Roman,
    then Century Expanded and Caledonia. I think Helvetica will sometimes be used
    in this mode, even if Helvetica Medium, normally used for signage, goes under
    \"Message\". These are utilitarian typefaces, used for ordinary communication
    - often, without much thought being put into the choice, by people who are not
    typographers. Courier can go here some of the time too.\r\n\r\nPublic: If Caslon
    and Garamond - then this is where traditional classic typefaces are used for things
    like the \"visual identity\" of a prestigious college. This is where a typeface
    is formal and elegant - without verging into script or display.\r\n\r\nWhile the
    use of a typeface more clearly corresponds to one of these categories, one can
    also classify typefaces - although this classification is fluid - by their dominant
    use. Caslon was once firmly in the \"contact\" category in its heyday.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not quite sure where to fit Bodoni or Albertus here, though..."

  body: "@quadibloc : you've got it! :-)\r\n\r\nBodoni and Albertus belong to B3 category,
    because they are often used for publishing.\r\n\r\nThe C-class (code) is specific
    to programmers (context of use: text editor, emacs, vi, etc. --- in that specific
    context, type conveys information, nothing more ; to a certain extent, writing
    as a novelist is a kind of coding, and many writers appreciate typefaces like
    courier, especially if you use distraction-free text editors)"
