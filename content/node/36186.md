body: I came across http://organic.com/ today and I was impressed by the typeface
  in their logo. I ran it through "What The Font" but it didn't hit the mark. It suggested
  QType Semi and Sui Generis, either of which could have been a basis for their logo.
  But I'd be interested in knowing if they used an unmodified typeface.

  body: Looks influenced by Handel Gothic and/or Simian Display - Orangutan from House
    Industries. Probably one of those customized a bit.

    although I'm quite convinced that logo was custom designed.
