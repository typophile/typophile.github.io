body: "besides type i am obsessed with food. imagine that. in fact i'm currently working
  of my first book project for myself it it is going to be a book of family recipes.
  quite appropriate, i'd say, bringing together food and type.\r\nbut all this isn't
  what i really wanted to talk about. i was at the grocery store the other day and
  noticed a <a href=\"http://www.rachaelraymag.com/\">new magazine</a> by my favorite
  TV food personality, Rachael Ray. i just love magazines, but a few years back i
  was heart broken when my favorite design mag, One, was pulled after just one year's
  run. i'd be inconsolable if it happened again, so i'm sending out a plea for ya'll
  to check this one out, and if you feel so inclined, pick up a subscription so this
  one stays afloat and i won't be busted up.\r\nthnx for reading, and as always, please
  take my rablings with a grain of salt (pun intended). :^P\r\n\r\np.s. bonus points
  for the first person who can correctly identify the fonts used in the nameplate
  (i'll send you a gift subscription on me!)"

    it only had ONE really good issue. It was gorgeous and I still have it. Sadly,
    it was all materialism and no real substance. Which is not good for me as I''m
    a shop-a-holic. :^D '

  body: 'Ooh! My mom got me a subscription to ONE when I was in high school, and I
    was extremely happy for two issues before the magazine was scrapped. It''s too
    bad, though, because I still pull it out once in a while and flip through the
    glossy pages. '

  body: I could've gambled that there were three issues. Oh well, so goes to figure.
    The team knew it was dying. That is sad.

  body: i'm sure i have all 6 issues of One. what i loved about it was that it was
    cross-discipline with everything from product design to landscape design, &c.
    If that's what you mean by materialism, give me more of it! that mag is what turned
    me on to product design. that's why it has a tender spot in my heat to this day.

  body: aha. indeed. i did mean that. i suppose the word materialism has more negativity
    attached to it. i was simply saying it appeared to me as dwell still does. a magazine
    full of wishlists. but, you are right. it is the magazines that also act as visual
    stimulation for the 3d world.

  body: alas, i don't remember any type stuff. but then again, i think they weren't
    around long enough to really hit their stride. there may have been some (i doubt
    it tho) but it didn't jump out as being anything memorable if there was.

    maybe in a previous issue that I don't have?
