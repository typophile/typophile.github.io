body: I'm working on a project & need to know what the different typefaces the New
  York Times & New York Post use. If for some reason those aren't available to download,
  alternate typeface suggestions would be appreciated. I've been trying to guess as
  to what to use, but I'd like to see what people say the actual typefaces are. Thanks.

  body: "According to the study done a few years ago by Ascender Corp of 100 top US
    Newspapers, the N. Y. Times uses a custom version of Cheltenham, and the New York
    Post uses Font Bureau Poynter. You can see the whole study [[http://www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/Ascender_Corp_Fonts_on_the_Front_Page_11_19_2004.pdf|here]].\r\n\r\nThese
    are for the main text, but the Study does list other typefaces used as well.\r\n\r\nThe
    Cheltenham used by the Times was designed by Carter & Cone for the paper, but
    a commercially available version from Linotype or one of the other foundries would
    not be very obviously different to most of us. \r\n\r\nYou said 'available to
    download', and I took that to mean 'purchase online'. If you are looking for free
    versions, don't waste your time.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
