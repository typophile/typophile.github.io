  date from the thirties or forties. I like it a lot but never knew the name of it.
  Then, when I saw it again on a poster at a historic mill, it occurred to me that
  you capable folks could probably identify it in an instant. Can anyone help me out?
  My apologies for the poor image quality. I didn't have my camera with me, but I
  was able to track down a photo of the same poster online.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in
  advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mill_3615.jpg]"

    R and completely straight or slightly curvy, which would be helpful in determining
    the precise face used\u2014although it\u2019s also quite possible that the entire
    display was either silkscreened or hand-painted, in which case the lettering may
    simply be a stencil-cutter\u2019s/letterer\u2019s fantasy."

    corresponds exactly with any particular production typeface. Nevertheless, I'd
    be very grateful for any leads on similar production faces\u2014with either curvy
    or straight-legged Rs."

    the M reaches all the way to the baseline. The only electronic versions that I''ve
    found so far are condensed, however.  '

  body: "Thanks, that's another good option. I'll check my copy of American Metal
    Typefaces of the Twentieth Century tonight, but I think Ludlow Tempo is going
    to end up being the closest match. I searched the forums here and it sounds like
    uncondensed versions of Tempo have yet to make the digital transition. Which is
    a real pity, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nEdit: Here's a shot of Tempo Bold:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TempoBold_3900.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    doesn't seem to be an exact match (the S looks a little different, for one thing),
    but it is awfully close."
