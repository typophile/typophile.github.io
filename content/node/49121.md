  I am posting this in the right section...\r\nI am desperate to find out how to get
  hold of this font, from a cd cover...I have been looking for the right font for
  ages in order to create a tattoo, saw this one on a poster yesterday and knew I
  have found it!\r\nPlease can anyone be as specific as possible regarding this font
  and where to find a quality printable version?\r\n\r\nMany many thanks, comrades!\r\n\r\nIGNACIO[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5606671x_4914.jpg]"
