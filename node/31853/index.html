<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I receive several design magazines and I have a very hard time keeping track of articles I read. Just the other day I read a tutorial describing a way to make vector tribal art with Adobe Illustrator. Wouldn't you know it? I can not for the life of me find the article. I've looked in all of my Adobe Illustrator mags, Photoshop User, Layers, Before and After UGH!
Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction? Your assistance is VERY much appreciated.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>i don't know the article but it seems like it would be easy to do. was it about
starting from scratch or tracing existing images ?
i'd draw it by hand first, at least the primary curves. scan, place in illustrator, vector trace.
the illustrator point/blunt distortion filter might come in handy.
copy, paste, reduce, enlarge, for rhythmic repetitions.
tribal art is a vague term for several styles so it depends...</div>

<div class=commentbody>CH,
It was a tutorial that was from scratch. It mimicked the artwork you see in all the television commericals right now. It isn't tribal by definition, but that's the closest term I could come up with.
Thanks for your reply.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I haven't seen a tutorial, but it doesn't seem that complicated. I would scan the art, take it into Illustrator, run the auto trace tool, then clean up the vector lines. If you just want to get some ready made, here's a link if you haven't seen it already... not bad for fifteen US dollars:

<div class=commentbody>Ch - This may sound kind of lame, would you suggest YouTube for the frame grab?
Aluminum - Thank you very much for the link. The article was very much along the same line as the link you provided.
BlueStreak - we have been debating which pack(s) to buy from that very site. Those are excellent packs for the price. Thank you very much.</div>

<div class=commentbody>youtube ? sure, if there's something on there you know you like.
i'm just curious - the label "tribal" gets thrown around alot...
comedy central was running a nice campaign for a while with lots of
what i would call "symmetrical baroque grunge animations" very similar to
(if not derived from) the geomedia packs.
are you trying to imitate something you've seen & if so, why ?
a client request ? can you come up with something original ?
is it a rush, or do you have time to develop something ?
no wrong answers - all familiar conditions...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ch,
I believe you've hit the nail on the head with a much more accurate and better description of the look I am trying to imitate. If you watch anything on Discovery/Comedy Central/you-name-it-channel, you'll see examples. The client? Product Managers. They've come to us to apply that same look and feel to a line of backpacks/messenger bags. They described one of the looks should resemble 'tribal art'. I immediately thought of the 'symmetrical baroque grunge' look that you mentioned. It just so happened, I had received a magazine of some sort that had a step by step tutorial on how to achieve that very look. However, with all the magazines I get, I can not for the life of me locate or replicate that tutorial.
I gave them something as the turnaround of the project was a couple of days. My personality will not allow me to settle for what was given, so I decided to investigate more in-depth on my own.</div>
