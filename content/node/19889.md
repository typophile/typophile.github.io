  body: "Soo, I see you did it, but why did you do it? :) Hmm, I think I dont quite
    get it.\r\nWhy did you choose to set / build a word, from 'cfr'? <em>( Is there
    any sense or hidden meaning beyond it? )</em>\r\n\r\nBut, Ive previously seen
    a complete character set made up from cut up numbers. I think it was by DesignerShock,
    or even NeubauBerlin.\r\n\r\nDav"

    whole alphabet.\r\n\r\nc-f-r are the consonants of the (dutch) word 'cijfer' (engl.
    'cipher') which has Arab origins (in Arabic, it says 'zero')\r\nSomewhat esoteric
    maybe.\r\n\r\nAnyway, economy of form, that's what i'm looking for.\r\nBesides
    that, legibility must be taken into account."

  body: I'm impressed that TFJ did this, but not surprised. I'll guess that someone
    who understand lettershapes and how they interact with others within context could
    simplify just as he has done. Really nice. Thanks for sharing, Hrant.

  body: "Nice!\r\n\r\n@ hrant: this experiment shows why handwriting is often readable
    only for the one who wrote it. Found it really difficult to decode. I think the
    shapes are a little too 'spontaneous' but the idea is very clear & attractive.\r\n\r\n@
    Steven Wulf: this is just the thing I am looking for. Type as a spare box of Lego."
