  40-50 years old [I think]. I can scan & submit more samples if needed.  Any help
  identifying or approximating this font is appreciated. The end result does not need
  to look dirty/typewritten/reproduced like the sample - the clean, modern equivalent
  would actually be preferable.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typewriter_font_sample_4313.png]\r\n\r\nThanks

    exactly just suggestions, so here a view fonts similar to [[http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=american+typewriter&q=Go|American

  body: The a and the g remind me of Courier, but your sample is not monospaced. There
    were IBM typewriters that could use proportional fonts, but I don't know if a
    "Courier proportional" typeface existed.

  body: "Thanks for the thoughts - very appreciated.  The g and a are what caught
    my [very untrained] attention too.  Most typewriter type fonts use a double story
    g - which I find very distracting - barf.\r\n\r\nI was going to ask about the
    proportional vs not - thanks for letting me know about that - and the IBM part
    too. A big help. \r\n\r\nIf you put the likely time frame and the proportional
    bit together you would end up with perhaps an IBM Executive typewriter:\r\n[[http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2004/09/ibm-executive-typewriters.html]]\r\n\r\nThe
    picture from the above page/link is very poor quality.  I would say that this
    might be IBM Secretarial Type but the lowercase y does not seem to match.  It
    looks pretty close though.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tpyewriter_sample_2_3887.png]\r\n\r\nAre
    there any resources that you may know about for the various IBM types that have
    been made into current fonts?  Or anywhere I might find good information about
    the various IBM types?  There were gazillions of these typewriters made [Executive
    & Selectric] - they were the most popular typewriters on earth with gazillions
    x gazillions of pages of documents typed on these things.  I would think that
    someone would have taken it on to recreate these types?  Or am I just talking
    crazy analog?  Am I in the wrong forum?"

  body: "This is what i got when I put IBM into font font which is kind of interesting,
    It looks like Courier was actually designed specifically for the Selectric typewriter
    series... It also showed <em>Letter Gothic</em> as a specific typeface designed
    for the Selectric series! (maybe you all ready knew this from your research)\r\n\r\n<em>Courier
    draw line \u2013 Designed as a typewriter face for IBM, Courier was redrawn by
    Adrian Frutiger for the IBM Selectric series. Courier is a typical fixed pitch
    design, monotone in weight and slab serif in concept. The Courier font is used
    to emulate typewriter output for reports, tabular work and technical documentation.</em>"

  body: "I can definitely say that none of the typeface samples listed here so far
    is IBM Secretarial (public release 1939), a typeface I know well and really love
    and which I have worked on digitizing. If the typewriter division is still going
    at Lexmark, they would be able to help identify the typeface. Otherwise, email
    me and I will try to look up some of the old IBM typeface designers who helped
    me with Bud Kettler's bio for the Courier page at graphos.org - - which is now
    down but which I hope to have up again in a few weeks. Secretarial is a simple
    5-unit slab, very similar to faces like Rockwell. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the Dan
    Rather/G Bush letter, one of these ex-IBM/Lexmark/ people, examining the admittedly
    dreadful quality fax that was made available to the public, came to the conclusion
    that the typeface used must have been from the IBM Executive that had Times --
    this was based, I think, on the eccentric height of the hyphen. And there were
    known sales of IBM Executive typewriters to that office. But with that lousy fax,
    who could really tell? Will anyone ever get to the bottom of that freakish story? "

  body: "Just a couple of other things: Courier was not designed for the Selectric,
    but rather well before; and I don't know of a proportional variation.\r\n\r\nFrutiger
    DID NOT WORK ON ANY VERSION OF COURIER. This was an error on the Agfa/Monotype
    website that should long ago have been corrected. There is no basis for this claim
    whatever. Frutiger however did work on some fonts for the Selectric Composer:
    \r\n\r\n\"Bud [Kettler] worked with Adrian Frutiger on fonts for the IBM Selectric
    Composer. Frutiger was very good but Bud had to help him through some technical
    problems. The upper case M and W of Frutiger's design were too bold for the limited
    impact from the type element. Bud decided he could cut down on the surface area
    without cutting down on the surface size. Bud did this by redesigning the M and
    W with a series of lines that would resemble a plowed field in a shallow pyramid
    pattern. The ribbon that was impacted by the modified M and W would spread across
    the furrows on the face of the characters and make them appear on paper as solid
    characters.\"\r\n\r\n(from my temporarily down 'graphos.org' page on Bud Kettler;
    reminiscence by Paul Rainey, one of Bud Kettler's colleagues on the IBM/Lexmark
    type team)\r\n\r\nI'm going to suggest to Lexmark that they do an IBM/Lexmark
    typewriter typeface ID page. They have all that info on file."
