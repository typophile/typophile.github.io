  am creating a new website and I can't seem to find a navigation style I like. The
  client wants the navigation to have more pop but i keep coming up with templated,
  web 2.0 looking navs. The other problem is that i will need to have a drop down
  menu for many of the main links and can't decide how i want to format this either.\r\n\r\nI
  have attached a couple of try's. Any ideas would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Jesse\r\n"

    on other aspects.\r\n\r\nGood idea about the boxes & I agree with you about the
    pattern. The problem with rollovers is that i despise them.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your ideas. Here is the updated layout:\r\nhttp://norcaldesigns.com/jesse/TurfPro_layout_101e.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looks a lot better, but now you're mixing serif and sans in your navigation.
    Your aversion to rollovers is funny, because the client said he/she wanted the
    navigation to pop, which is something rollovers help accomplish. Also, rollovers
    can be very subtle, you don't have to change the color of the entire block. \r\n\r\nI'm
    also not in love with the way the blue in the forms box is coming up against the
    green background, you may take the opacity back on that blue or something. \r\n\r\n-Andrew"

  body: "[something happened to my first comment and it got deleted, this is it for
    the record]\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nCould you settle on a sans serif, especially since
    you seem to be using both faces in the same style (caps)?\r\n\r\nI like the implicit
    boxes with shadows on 1, more than your stroked. If you go with the implicit ones,
    you'll want to use that style throughout. \r\n\r\nPattern isn't really working
    in 3, I'm okay with it in 2. As far as navigation, what do you have in mind for
    rollovers? The gray nav in 1 and 3 surely lack pop, could you use some green,
    that gets darker on rollover, or an underline or something?\r\n\r\nSmaller stuff
    that catches my eye.. Don't need \"Address\", Black pull quote seems out of place,
    but I don't know what you could do with it. Lastly the logo has a lot of head
    room, almost awkwardly so. \r\n\r\n-Andrew"

  body: "Weird that your first comment disappeared! I updated the layout to remove
    the blue background and fixed the sans. The right side doesn't pop as much without
    the blue but the blue did feel out of place. Thanks again for your ideas.\r\n-Jesse"

  body: I prefer the header and nav in 101b, with the drop down menu keeping the same
    shading and appearance. I think it would look much cleaner with a sans-serif in
    the nav and throughout the site though. The right hand column in 101e looks more
    focused and organized than in the other designs.
