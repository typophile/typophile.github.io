  body: "I may be wrong, but the way the letters in Beau-soir look reminds me of what
    happens when you start playing with outline points in Illustrator. I would guess
    at least part of it started out as a square sans like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/europa-grotesque-rr/extra-bold/|Europa
    Grotesque]] that has been flattened. Maybe something squarer, but you get the
    idea.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
