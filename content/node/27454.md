  body: "Thanx for your helpful comments! Must have been working on it too fanatically,
    really thought it was small but legible.\r\n\r\nThe idea was that all horizontal
    and vertical parts should not meet each other, in order to keep the shapes thin.
    That's why some letters are broken up.\r\n\r\nBut, following your remarks, breaking
    up the shapes DOES break up legibility.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame, now I have to leave
    my principles. ;-)\r\n\r\n(there will be an update)"

    forms. \r\n\r\nWith regards to yours, I liked some of the earlier forms within
    the characters, but they were less legible. It is the balance between interesting
    letter shape and legibility. The closer you come to making it legible, the more
    it looks like other pixel fonts \u2026"

    pixel font on the planet.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picopixel_4772.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    \"rush to pixelize\" is because only with pixel fonts, you can get that small.
    With normal fonts, characters get unreadable after you go below a certain size.
    Pixel fonts are optimized for their size.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of it?\r\n\r\nBadda\r\n\r\n[[http://sitexplorer.redio.de/picopixel/Picopixel.ttf|Click

  body: badda, it's readable. I like it. Uppercase usage should work well. Can you
    fix "V" and/or "Y"? They are very similar. Also "0" and/or "O"? Maybe a slashed
    zero? Also can small "a" have a counter for consistency?

  body: I agree with Alphapeta, I didn't have too much trouble reading your first
    draft & it definitely had much more character. Since you posted it in the pixel
    DISPLAY section, I would guess you choose form over function. In that regard you
    should leave it the way you originally designed it.... it looks good & it's legible
    enough.

    said for vectorfonts or pretty much everything? We're already spoiled for choice
    when it comes to vectorfonts, music, art, books, movies,...\r\n\r\n> Afterall,
    it is not an artistic venture. It is a minimal venture\r\n\r\nPixelfonts are a
    great way of learning about type in a simplified way. Besides, simplifying things
    & bringing them back to a minimum of pixels is an artform in itself. The power
    of suggestion & fooling the eyes is a big part of designing pixelfonts. Not everyone
    can do it."

    just to see if it was possible to deschipher the 3x3-pixel-matrix as letters.
