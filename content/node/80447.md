  summer in the last 2 weeks of July.\r\nI need some typographic ideias and sugestions
  for:\r\n\r\n1- Good bookshops for used material (type specimens preferable!)\r\n2-
  Nice libraries with type specimens \r\n3- Exibithion about graphic design/designers\r\n4-
  A one day experience in letterpress (free or cheap). A short course or printshop
  for playing with old lead type!\r\n\r\nOf course that other sugestions are welcome,
  like a great pub or restaurant.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
