  body: I'd suggest something more of a counterpoint. Where Serpentine has strong
    characteristics I'd go with something like less so.

  body: It will help a lot to know more about your project. There are literally thousands
    of typefaces that could work with Serpentine. What matters most is the content
    and audience of your piece.

  body: "What I am doing is using Serpentine light as the base font for a logo.  What
    I would like to do is have a choice of fonts that would compliment this font in
    other business uses such as brochures, memo, invoices etc.  One that is a serif
    and one that is a san serif\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

  body: Perhaps you start with a squarish serif like ITC Slimbach (quite narrow) or
    Melior (wider).

  body: "The business is a retailer of sporting goods,  There audience is highly diversified
    consisting of businesses and consumers. \r\n\r\nDepending on the particular recreation
    activity the conumer would  comprise youngsters 6-19 (for team, individual and
    action sports),  men and women 20-35 for recreational activities (running, hiking,
    yoga, physical fitness) and 35-55 year old men and women (outdoor recreation such
    as walking, fishing, camping, hunting etc). \r\n\r\n For businesses it would consist
    of wholesalers and manufacturers of footwear, apparel and sporting goods equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
    instance a company that I read about uses Eurostile bold for their logo but for
    corporate collateral will only allow the following fonts:\r\n\r\nITC Slimbach
    Book\r\nITC Slimbach Book Italic\r\nITC Slimbach Medium\r\nITC Slimbach Medium
    Italic\r\nFormata Light\r\nFormata Light Italic\r\nFormata Regular\r\nFormata
    Italic\r\nFormata Medium\r\nFormata Medium Italic\r\nFormata Small Caps\r\nFormata
    Medium Italic\r\n\r\nThis is what I am trying to do with Serpentine Light\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

  body: "Are there other fonts besides Melior or Slimbach that compliment this font?
    \ I have thought to use Cheltenham and Eurostile but I am not sure if these are
    considered good pairings for this font.  I am needing addition serif and san serif
    choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI
