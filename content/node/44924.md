  body: "This is an old Letraset lowercase-only font called Camellia that had both
    wide and narrow versions of every letter. There is a digital version by that name,
    but it only has the wide letters. The missing narrow letters match your sample.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/camellia-lt/\r\n"

  body: Thanks! It does look very close.  However, even in a thinner version, the
    's' and 'v' do not look like they would match.  Would they be styled different
    in a thinner version?

  body: "You're right about the 'v', I hadn't noticed that before. As you can see
    in this scan from an old Letraset catalog, everything else matches:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/camellia001_6109.jpg]\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the 'v' was modified because it looked too much like the 'u'."

  body: "Yup, it looks like a perfect match except for the 'v'.  Now where can I get
    a digital copy of the lowercase letters? :)\r\n\r\nThanks much!\r\n"

    Christie</a> had the Camellia lowercase. I don't have the font or a full showing,
    so don't know about that 'v', though.
