  working on a (student) project where I'll be creating a small exhibition \r\nspace
  describing some aspects of Maroc.\r\n\r\nWhile I will have some arabic text (for
  atmosphere), this exhibit would be \r\ngeared to the English speaker, so I'll need
  an English-langage typeface to \r\ndeliver my information.\r\n\r\nI'll be discussing
  primarily the people and crafts of the country -- and not \r\nthe showcardianism
  of Bogey's Casablanca, et al.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for type that might have some
  interesting features but \r\nremain readable? A touch of the arabesque without being
  campy?\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    sizes, media, lighting, etc.?

      catalog. signage definitely, as well as some large text panels.\r\ni am not
      sure of the point size--which will vary by the face chosen--\r\nbut open to
      suggestions of size/face pairings for easy viewing."

    \r\n\r\nrandom, but i think the word \"Morrocco\" looks quite nice and there's
    a little bit of a cultural connection with the whole Spain/Morrocco thing\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nnc"
