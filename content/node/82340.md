  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    GHD hair straighteners, <a href=\"http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to
    britney\u2019s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty,
    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get
    those ghd\u2019s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults
    include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P>"

  body: "These glyphs are very geometric which makes some very unstable and visually
    uneven. Take /s/ for instance which seems as if top half is bigger than the bottom
    half.\r\n\r\nGlyphs also seem of having different weight. Look at word /often/
    in the second line. /e/ seems much lighter compared to neighbouring /f/ and /t/.\r\n\r\nYou
    will have to change bowl of /a/ because it seems as if someone is pushing it up
    on the left.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise... With some work this monospaced font may be
    useful even though lately there's tendency for readable shaped monospaced fonts.
    Imagine developers reading and writing code all day long. It's easier to read
    all that code when font is much more legible. \"Consolas\" for instance (which
    is a modern monospaced font) is a very good example of such font. Non-legible
    monospaced fonts are otherwise too much strain and tend to make people tired after
    using them for hours."

    to set code in your books... Since I assume your primary goal in writing such
    books is to convey the <em>content</em> to readers (as opposed to express your
    desire to design fonts) what I would ask first is: what do you find lacking in
    existing monospace fonts you could use?\r\n\r\nBTW, if you like Consolas, also
    try Inconsolata.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a certain charm, that makes them appropriate for a number of occasions, such as

    To me there's too much variance and unevenness, making the result more \"messy\"

    agree with Hrant that there is... well I'd say \"too much going on.\"\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the bold really needs some different treatment of how curves join straight stems,
    because they look pretty clotted. Any one or more of these options might help:\r\n-
    optical compensation (thinning the curved strokes a bit before they join)\r\n-
    changing the letterforms so they don't usually extend past the join (like at the
    bottom of a \"b\" for instance)\r\n- increasing the angle of the joins\r\n- reducing
    the weight of the bold\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
