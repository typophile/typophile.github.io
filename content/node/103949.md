body: "I'm designing an annual research report into wealth generation and thinking
  for a premium estate agency. I specified Hoefler and Freres Landmark because of
  it heritage (New York building signage circa 1950). Just wondered if anyone could
  suggest anything similar? \r\n\r\nAlso I need a body copy font to pair with it -
  currently using Swift but can anyone suggest something else? It's targeted towards
  high net worth individuals and is reporting on how, where and on what they spend
  their wealth (millions) and is used for marketing the high end property practice.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100044"

    mmm... maybe UMBRA/TEMPO or Gill Sans Shadowed and Light Shadowed\r\n"

  body: "Darrenn, a type in the same vein of Landmark - but with a wider range of
    styles, glyphs, weights - could be Neutraface, which could also work as body copy:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, House Ind. also licenses a family named \"Luxury\"...\r\n\r\nAs for the
    body copy, if you're after a serif, you could try to keep a link to the modernist
    cultural heritage of the XX century by using something related to Century - like
    FB's Bureau Roman or Benton Modern, both available on request:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/serif/BureauRoman/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModern/\r\n\r\n...
    if those don't look too \"traditional\".\r\n\r\nA couple of more \"contemporary\"
    alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Matthew Carter's Fenway;\r\n- Christian Schwartz's Publico
    Text.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
