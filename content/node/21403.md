body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nI've been charged with designing the logo/branding for an online
  company whose aim it is to help sell independant art products for designers and
  artists worldwide. The idea is that artists can set up their own online store selling
  their wares -- so it must be quite a versatile brand.\r\n\r\nMy first three ideas
  are below -- any and all comments would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-01_5009.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-02_3944.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-03_5867.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: The double c's as cherries is a nice idea, but what concerns me is the stigma
    attatched to the "pair of cherries" imagery. Need i say more?

    vertical bar. A shift in color is enough. In fact, the bar plus the color shift
    sets it off so much that i read the words apart from each other. It''s as if "collective"
    is a division of a company called Cherry. '

  body: I don't like the third for sure, the 2 C are strange and looks too cmmercial.
    I like the other two but I would remove the point and the bar, I would join the
    two words and only differenciate both with colors. What dou you think?

  body: "I like the first one's style (with the \"ct\" ligature) but I'm not a big
    fan of Mrs. Eaves. She's been a little overused recently. I see where you're going
    with the red cherry-like dot, but to me it doesn't quite work.\r\n\r\nThat little
    ligature looks almost like a cherry stem, and the ball terminal of the 'c' would
    make an excellent red cherry. Maybe another one hanging off the 't' in another
    direction would also work (you might be able to cut it off the \"it\" ligature).
    These are just suggestions. They might not work as well as I hope.\r\n\r\nI think
    you definitely need to hide a cherry or two in the logo somewhere. To me a cherry
    has a distinctive heart shape and a stem.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Thanks for the comments everyone.\r\n\r\nOne thing I should've said in the
    original post was that the client has specifically said that she doesn't want
    actual cherries in the logo.\r\n\r\n<strong>seventy7</strong>: Haha. You may be
    right about the bar though; in all honesty, I think the bar is a bit of a cop
    out anyway, only there to prove I can do more than just string two words together
    ;)\r\n\r\n<strong>tonicastro</strong>: too commercial? in that you think it's
    not appropriate for an arty/independant company?\r\n\r\n<strong>Lex</strong>:
    I know what you mean about Mrs Eaves -- I feel the same -- but this is the first
    project I've ever considered using it where it <em>felt</em> right. Your idea
    for converting the ligature into a pair of cherries is brilliant, but I fear not
    practical. I could be wrong, I'll try it out.\r\n\r\nRe: The dot in the first
    logo: Is it just a bit too big/prominent? Or is it just it's existence at all.
    I rather like it ... but then I did put it there :)\r\n\r\nI forgot to mail the
    PSD to myself at work, so I can't play with them now, but I will later on. Thanks
    again for your input, and to everyone else, don't hold back!\r\n\r\nJordan"

    way too small in relation to the type.\r\n\r\nIf you need a cherry icon (not sure
    if you do) maybe consider other context...cherry in a martini...on a sundae...etc.\r\n\r\nI'd
    also put more of a separator between the two words...you want it to read well
    in black and white as well."

    (as I've said, the client actually requested 'no cherries'), that logo was just
    a playful representation of an idea earlier in the thread. Very good point about
    the separator though -- it will need to work in black and white ... now I'm torn,
    as the full point punctuation in idea 1 (top) would have solved this.\r\n\r\n<strong>tonicastro</strong>:

    all, keep the crits coming! I'd be interested to hear if you think it's acceptable
    to say that in full colour, there's no space, and in black/white, include a space.\r\n\r\nJordan"

    on corporate identity, but would say that if you could find another way to go
    over the black/white issue it would be better than using a different space between
    words.\r\n\r\nIs there a chance in finding a way between 1 and 1a? I might also
    suggest some kind of movement in the descendant of the \"y\".\r\nMaybe those two

  body: "I find the Mrs Eaves versions have an exaggerated ascender and descender
    also there is a kerning issue around the er, ect and ol. I also feel that the
    ct ligature is a bit limp compared to, for example, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-caslon/\">Adobe
    Caslon's</a>. \r\nI think that the spacing should be consistent, it needn't be
    a full word space, once you have finalised(ish) the kerning for the other characters
    you could try a number of spaces, my guess would be that you could use quite a
    thin space and still achieve separation of the words, (I also don't object to
    your initial separators although the baseline needs raising for the dot).\r\nThe
    dusty red you have chosen seems a little lacking in comparison to the rich dark
    red of a cherry, however, screen quality could be contributing to that.\r\nTim"

  body: "<strong>gabssnake</strong>: Good call about the y -- it does look a little
    anaemic.\r\n\r\n<strong>timd</strong>: The exaggerated asc/desc's of Mrs Eaves
    is what I like about it most. I agree about the lack of flair in the ct lig, but
    I've tried Caslon/Jensen and aside from the x-height being too large, I think
    they lack the personality of Mrs Eaves. Excellent spots with the kerning issues,
    you're absolutely right.\r\n\r\nI also agree about the shade of red -- I've found
    it very difficult trying to come up with a shade of red that seems cherry-ish:
    with anything from almost black to a pale crimson being appropriate. I think it
    could definitely do with a little more vibrancy though -- if for no other reason
    than to give more contrast between it and the black.\r\n\r\nI've tweaked the kerning,
    reduced the space between the words, fattened out the y descender, and given the
    shade of red a kick up the backside. Thoughts:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-01d_4032.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks,

    apart I think it is time to show the client maybe with a few visuals of the logo
    in action to get a reaction. The extra work on the y has made more of an improvement

  body: When I looked at this, I immediately saw the ct lig as a cherry itself, with
    the c being the cherry and the ascender as the stem.  It may look corny, but maybe
    you could make the c red but keep the lig curve (stem) and the t black.  Besides
    that, I like your developing design with a simple space between the words.

  body: I saw the same thing with the lig and the "c". Even though your client requested
    no cherries, it may be that they pictured a corny illustration of a cherry. If
    you do something tasteful and sophisticated/understated they may like it. This
    typeset is nice, but you do need something to set it apart and make it a logotype,
    and not just a font choice. To me it is not at that point.

    only way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nI guess you have already finished with this but,
    maybe working with weights (like on 3) would add something, and also help you
