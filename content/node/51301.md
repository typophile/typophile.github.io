body: I just read about Kindersley's "MoT serif"-typeface, originally designed for
  British roadsigns, but never used. Does anyone know if this face has ever been digitized?
  It is a very interesting typeface, although very peculiar.

    from Wikipedia: Kindersley invented a system for the accurate spacing of letters,
    which though often praised, has not seen wide adoption. Kindersley's work in this
    area formed the basis of an artist's project by his former assistant the calligrapher
    Owen Williams called Testing David.[10] In 1952 he submitted a design, MoT Serif,
    to the British Ministry of Transport, who required new lettering to use on United
    Kingdom road signs. Although the Road Research Laboratory found Kindersley's design
    more legible, the all-capitals design with serifs was passed over in favour of
    that of Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert. Many of the street signs in England,
    especially in Cambridge use Kindersley fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a whole chapter
    on this in the book \"Type: The Secret History of Letters\", a great book by the
    way..."
