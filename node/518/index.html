<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Please critique my Mattikdesign logotype (image below). I have done publication design, now do mostly Web design, but have little experience with logotypes. This one is for my own design company, in which I want to focus on more sophisticated, subtle (less flashy) Flash design. <br> <br>The logotype uses ITC New Baskerville. I added the "tti" ligature, and altered the descender on the "g." And because it has to look good on screen, I flattened the bottoms of the baseline serifs (to avoid blurry little curves). I'm not sure about my kerning, or if my modifications have broken any rules of good typographic design. Any feedback would be truly appreciated. <br> <br>Note: Please be patient if it takes some time for me to reply to your response. Thanks! <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12492.jpg alt="Mattikdesign Logotype"></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Do you really want to convey such a conservative attitude? If you do, I think Baskerville is a great choice. But you might consider livening it up, maybe by doing something with the descender of the "g" (noting that it's the only descender). But please no swoosh. :-) <br> <br>The bar in the "tti" ligature looks a bit stiff. Try making it taper, thinner on the left, and (optically) matching the normal head serif shape on the right. <br> <br>The dot(s) on the "i"(s) are too high, and maybe slightly too small. <br> <br>I think I like the "k", but I'm not sure. <br> <br>Spacing: Looks OK. Tighten up the "gn" a bit (maybe while raising the ear), and loosen the "at" a hair. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks so much, Hrant, for the thoughtful and useful feedback. I couldn't get the "tti" ligature taper to look right, but I did make it thinner. The image below incorporates most of your suggestions...<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12534.jpg alt=mattiklogo2> <br>The result is very pleasing to me, and I just may go with this as my logotype, for I think it conveys sophistication, and the ability to use traditional elements in contemporary ways. <br> <br>I don't want to appear boring or uncreative, however, so I tried a multitude of approaches to liven it up, including many variations on the descender of the "g" (avoiding swashes). Everything looked contrived, and any additional element detracted from the beauty of the letterforms. <br> <br>Finally, I tried merely moving one element: the dot on the 2nd "i": <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12535.jpg alt=mattiklogo-eye> <br>This definitely adds playfulness and interest, but I wonder if it's too cute, or if it too closely resembles another logo. I think it implies an examining eye, which is foundational to good design. It would also lend itself to a Flash treatment, which is appropriate for a designer seeking to specialize in Flash websites. But does it look good? Forgive me if this diverges too much from typography to graphic design and other considerations... <br> <br>Anyway, I'd be grateful for any additional feedback or suggestions--from you or from any others in the forums--regarding either of the above logotypes, or alternate suggestions for adding interest/distinction to my basic logotype. Thanks so much! --Jim <br> <br>PS: This was my first new forum, and I think Typophile has created an amazing community resource. May they keep up the good work! <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>The dot in the 'g' is quite fun and adds an element <br>of surprise, but it might indeed be perceived as too <br>cutesy by some. Also, to me it looks like a face <br>with a surprised/frightened expression: the dot in <br>the counter being the eye with the ear as raised <br>eyebrow, and the open loop is the mouth. I don't <br>know if that was your intention.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the "dot play", too. But I am afraid that merging of the q's stroke and the dot makes the left part of this character too heavy and therefore destroys the rythm of the whole. Maybe at smaller sizes the dot even won't be visible and just a weird distorted "g" will remain. A possible solution could be to move the dot slightly to the right, but I am not sure if there is enough place to do that (the dot in the centre of the counter probably wouldn't work so well). Another solution: Make the dot black. This solution makes some troubles too: what will happpen at B&W reproduction... <br> <br>A suggestion: maybe the dot could just "jump" towards the "g" but remain above it. It would of course spoil the eye effect, but may suggest movement > animation > interacitvity > flash... <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you Yves, Matjaz and Alex. You've convinced me that although my "eye" design has problems, working with the dot is the right direction. As my focus is online (and that's where the first marketing contact will often be--without the use of spam, of course), I'm thinking the dot can be an animated character that does different things, to add playfulness and interest. <br> <br>The print version (less important for me), could be the "plain" logotype, but ideally would have something that indicates animation (as Matjaz suggested). <br> <br>For print, what does anyone think of the following?

<div class=commentbody>> ...in which I want to focus on more sophisticated, subtle (less flashy) Flash design. <br> <br>I really didn't mean that you will present animation that litterate. I thought it will be just a little "mistake" of the dot position in an overall clean and classic-look logo. (a secondary animated effect, as Hrant suggests) That would suggest movement, but you could still archieve a bit more serious and sophisticated, LESS FLASHY design...

<div class=commentbody>Wow -- A lot of weekend posts! Thanks to all of you for your input. Yes, the very literal representation of animation in my previous version was annoying, but I thought it might lead somewhere better. <br> <br>And please forgive me for not catching on (lack of sleep?), but I don't think I understood Hrant's suggestion (which Tanya and Matjaz seemed to like) to leave both dots off, or the meaning of "a secondary animated effect." Maybe it's to keep the "straight" form for print, and save playing with the dots for online animation? Or was it really to take all the dots off for print, like this?: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12588.jpg alt="mattiklogo - no dots"> <br>Or was something altogether different being suggested? <br> <br>I did try the "slightly off" idea of Matjaz, but the results of that irritated me too. (Though maybe in more skilled hands...?) <br> <br>Perhaps I'm being indulgent messing with these dots; my original intent was for a clean, simple, appealing logotype, and now I'm trying to get it to do too much. If I really want to imply animation in print, I should probably design a logo from scratch for that purpose. <br> <br>So, unless there's a good idea I haven't explored, it seems I should just stop messing with the dots for print, and go with the straightforward version. If I can find an appropriate way online to introduce animation (and I now see several possibilities), I can do that later, and can change it more easily than the printed stuff. (But if anyone still wants to give/clarify dot suggestions, I'll of course consider them.) <br> <br>What I'd finally like to ask--and this is actually why I originally started this forum, so pardon the dot sidetracking--is if anyone sees any *typographic* problems remaining with the logotype. Hrant and a few friends have helped me get some of my major problems fixed, so from a purely typographic standpoint, is it good to go? <br> <br>David Hamuel wondered why I did the "tti" ligature. Maybe for any of you to evaluate what I've done, it would be good for me to show the "raw" type (1, below) so you can compare it with what I've done (2, below). The raw type is ITC New Baskerville, set in Illustrator with reduced tracking, but no hand kerning. Here they are: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12589.jpg alt="mattiklogo -process"> <br>So, keeping in mind that on-screen appearance takes priority, is there anything else you hard-core type experts see in this thing that needs to be fixed? Be amicably ruthless, please. <br> <br>Again, sincere thanks to previous (and any future) contributors. A deadline may keep me away for a day or so, but I'll be back then to respond to any new offerings. --Jim <br> <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Tanya-- Sorry, I didn't see your last post before doing mine.

<div class=commentbody>I'll be a little cynical here, but people aren't going to hire your flash skills just because you can animate your own logo. Just because you focus on flash does *not* mean you need an animated logo ;o) <br> <br>Some random thoughts: <br> <br> - I prefer it sans dots (though that maybe means the ligature isn't really needed...perhaps just tie in the tt and skip the i) <br> <br> - if you want the dots, maybe just swap the two colors. Dunno if that is a good idea or not...just throwing it out there. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello, Jim. <br> <br>Why not keep it simple? Flash doesn't mean 'flashy' and I think that's your philosophy too. So don't worry about animation, and keep it subtle. You don't need to try to make a picture with your type! I like the 'tti' ligature and no dots makes it just slightly different from others. Keep your first colours, and you've got yourself a pretty smart wordmark.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice summary! <br> <br>I like #7. The smallcaps "i" gives that little twist I was saying is valuable, plus it flows very well in the "tti". <br> <br>The only thing that bugs me is the bottoms of the "ti" are too close. Maybe reduce the size of the "t" foot curls. If you don't, you at least have to space apart the "ti" a bit. And the "ig" is a hair tight. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I noticed right now that the g's lover curve is a bit rough. When you have been making it more open (numbers 1 and 2 in your post of July 07, 2003 - 2:14 am), which is your decision and might be good, a bottom part of the stroke (the thinnest one) has became too thick. Compare with the original Barskerville design, to see what I mean. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Getting very close... Thanks for the further input. At this point I've decided to go with the design of the previously posted version 7, so all I need now is to finish the fine tuning, which I still seem to need help with. (But thanks p.j. and Emir for trying the variations.) <br> <br>Here are versions 8a and 8b, which only differ in the spacing of the "ti": <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12752.jpg alt="mattiklogos 8a & 8b"> <br>Now I'll address some of your points individually (but others please feel free to comment on what follows): <br> <br>Hrant-- I added that hair of space to the "ig," and then I reduced the foot curls on the "t"s (and the bottom curled serif on the "a" to match), and added a bit of space between the "ti." 8a shows the increased space, and 8b has just a bit more space there. Which do you think is better, or do I need even more space yet? And did I create any new problems in the process? <br> <br>Alex-- I tried raising the tops of the "t"s, but it looked odd no matter how I did it. And I appreciate you pointing out the "empty space" above the second i; my clients usually say they want designs with lots of white space, so I think it's good that my logo suggests a sense of empty space. <br> <br>Matjaz-- It's really good that you spotted that fat descender on the g. When I did my initial work before my first post, I made several modifications to reduce the onscreen distortion caused by antialiasing my vector art, which was the worst in Flash. These mods were the things I felt the most insecure about presenting to typographers, and I wondered if anyone would notice. I think you're the first (in 34 posts) to mention any of this! I actually imaged that this topic of modifying type to look good onscreen with antialiasing (not a pixel font) might generate the most discussion in my thread. <br> <br>I mentioned right up front that I had changed the baseline serifs (removing their bottom "dimples"). The g (my more open version as well as the Baskerville) was tending to get a flat section on the bottom of the descender, and thickening it seemed to counteract this. But if it's bad typography, I want to change it. I tried to compromise with the g in version 8 (a & b) above. How does that look? <br> <br>I had the same "flattening" problem with the top of the "a," and did a similar fattening of the stroke. But after the scrutiny inspired by your observation, I tried to thin that back up in this last version (above), although the letterform is still somewhat different in an attempt to reduce its antialias mess. <br> <br>Here's a comparison of how Flash rendered the outlines of the raw Baskerville "a" and my new compromise "a": <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12753.jpg alt='"a"s in Flash'> <br>But the logo will also appear in print, so I don't want to do anything too weird in compensating for antialias distortion. So, I'm hoping my new "a" stands on its own as a halfway decent letterform. Please look at the two "a"s enlarged (below), and let me know what you think: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12754.jpg alt='enlarged "a"s'> <br> <br>Well, everyone, thanks again for your help. One question (for the moderator?): Next I'll be trying to decide on color, and would like a variety of respondents. Is this forum appropriate for that? Thanks. --Jim <br> <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>I think 8a is the better one. <br> <br>Can you make the "s" wider? (Jeez, I'm sounding like a pesky client...) It seems to be drawing too much attention to itself. (In a text font you want width variance, because that helps readability, but in a logo it sometimes backfires.) <br> <br>About Flash fidelity: <br>1) Don't let it drive you crazy, you can circumvent it completely. <br>2) Using TT format instead of PST1 seems to reduce the strangeness. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>BTW, I also like Emir's "g" trick - but I'd dump the "i" dots there. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>David-- I appreciate your feedback. Glad you agree with Keith and Darrel, as I took that route of not trying to indicate animation, and removing the dots. <br> <br>As for Hrant's question about conservative, in my second post I guess I only implied an answer by saying I didn't want to appear boring or uncreative, so would try various things to liven it up. (This lead to all the variations that finally culminated in the basic design of version 7.) <br> <br>I think if conservative in this context means uncreative, I definitely don't want that. If, however, working creatively with existing elements in a non-radical, subdued/subtle way is considered conservative, then yes, that's something I'd like to realize (in my work and my logo). I really like the beauty of classic serif faces, and I wanted to try to use one in a way that was clean and somewhat contemporary. Since I work mostly with architects who often think sans serifs like Futura or Helvetica are the only way to have clean, "structural" type, it would be nice if my logo implied other creative possibilities for designing for architectural concerns. <br> <br>And to be honest, I'm so in over my head reworking these letterforms, and I've already devoted so much time to it, that at this point I'll settle for something that isn't ugly, avoids clich</div>

<div class=commentbody>> I'm building a logotype in Illustrator. <br> <br>OK, but same difference. Flash renders cubic beziers (the kind Postscript uses, in fonts, EPS, etc.) with lower fidelity than it renders quadratic beziers (the kind TrueType uses). So try importing your logo into Fontogapher or FontLab (preferably the latter) and outputting a TT font. Even though it won't be a "native" TT font (something that can only be done manually), from my experience it still renders better. <br> <br>> How can I avoid the distorting consequences of antialising? <br> <br>Just to be clear, anti-aliasing isn't your problem. Anti-aliasing is good for you! :-) The problem is how Flash distorts outlines, especially cubic beziers. <br> <br>> I've already devoted so much time to it, that at this point I'll just settle for something that isn't ugly <br> <br>Heh heh heh.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>Thanks for hanging in there with me on this, and for the encouragement. Here're 3 tweaks of version 9, each with an increasingly larger s (original not shown): <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12798.jpg alt=mattiklogo-9abc> <br>Do any of these seem right on? If not please direct as to larger/smaller. This was my first-ever attempt at reproportioning an entire letter, so I hope I did okay. <br> <br>Once the s is fixed, it should be about done, don't you think? <br> <br>As for the distortion of outlines: Wow, quadratic beziers? I think I missed that math class. To try your suggestion, I downloaded a trial version of Fontlab, but a half hour of tinkering in this unfamiliar interface got me nowhere. Just so I know I'm aiming at the right result, please clarify: Were you suggesting that I cut and paste the complete outlined Illustrator logotype right into a Fontlab character/glyph workspace window, and then export the whole thing as a TrueType font? ...And then in Flash (Fireworks, etc.) when I type the appropriate key in my new font, the whole logo would appear? This is so new and bizarre to me. (And if I can't do it with the trial version, I'll have to skip it altogether.) I may have to save this for down the road. <br> <br>Well, as soon as I get these final tweaks done, I can move on to deciding on a color. In your opinion, is it appropriate to ask for feedback on color in this forum/thread? <br> <br>Gratefully, <br>Jim M <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Jacques-- I missed <i>your</i> message. (You beat my post by two minutes.) Anyway, I was impressed not only by your effort on my behalf (must have taken some time!), but also by the interesting evolution you fleshed out. It seems like your "s" echoes the rounded tip on the "a," and your other mods further apply this softer touch. It looks to me like the start of a new "soft serif" typeface... <br> <br>And although, as you noticed, I'm really wanting to wrap this one up for now, I can always evolve it further later, and I'll definitely keep your ideas in mind for future reference. <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Jim M <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Dmitry and Ly-- Thanks for the input, but it's a bit unclear to me; as version 10 is basically the final version, I was asking above for any final tweaks to this version. <br> <br>Then Dmitry took <i>version 1,</i> which is the least modified from the plain Baskerville, and made two suggestions: linking the serifs on the "ik" and widenening the "s." This is confusing to me, because the "s" has already been widened since the version used by Dmitry, starting with version 9. (And incidentally, when I previously tried the "ik" serif linking, which seemed like a natural, it unfortunately produced some undesirable side effects.) <br> <br>Next, Ly responded to Dmitry's suggested changes to <i>version 1</i> by writing that "Now it feels like a logo." Compared to which version, and why? <br> <br>Any clarification from either of you would be appreciated, especially if it can be applied to the final version. Thanks. <br> <br>--Jim M</div>

<div class=commentbody>ooops<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0>.. i'd missd disscussion bout the "s" 4real.. sorry for that.. <br> <br>but anyway i really don't like "I" in last (10) version (maybe because other characters in small caps).. i mean it's all my own openion and i think about it like i doin logo for myself, you know what i mean<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0>? so even in 10 version i think the "s" still must be wider (jus look at "n" then to "s" and then to "i". do you see what i saw?) <br> <br>then.. by connected "ik" i'd try to say: maybe its resonable to make serifs strait, not rounded (or make some serifs strait and others left rounded.. )? <br> <br>and also check the space in "tti" in correlation with "ma".. <br> <br>and again sorry for my missunderstanding and maybe for my english (jus i'd learn it wit wu-tang tapes<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Dmitry-- Thanks for your clarification. And I think even for us whose first language is English, there's a lot to follow here. (Partly because I use too many words!) <br> <br>As for the serifs and the small cap "i," I can understand your comments, but I have other reasons (some mentioned above) for keeping them. <br> <br>But yes, maybe the "s" could be even wider. I'm new at this and was afraid to go too far. <br> <br>I'm also not very good at kerning, so I don't know what's needed when you say: 'and also check the space in "tti" in correlation with "ma"...' <br> <br>By the way, whether the English is "perfect" or not, I'm glad that people from so many countries are a part of Typophile. It makes it much more interesting and brings a wider perspective. My grandfather came from Belarus, but all I know is "tavarich" and "trud ne skazatz," and I probably spelled them wrong. My second language is Japanese, but I can't imagine trying to use it for a discussion about typography! --Jim M <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jim, I like the "design" elements added by Dmitry. These could be added to nearly any version that was preferred. I also like the restoration of the mustard color. It's a very positive color to me. Like a happy face! <br> <br>My response wasn't reached after hours of careful evaluation. I've followed the thread and had an immediate reaction. Upon closer inspection, I'd probably prefer some of the improvements suggested along the way (I am also a fan of Jacques' third "g"), but I just like including the marks of Dmitry's suggestion in the logo. <br> <br>I haven't seen an "s" in this series that was too wide. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Ly-- I appreciate the clarification. I'll try an even wider "s." And on the screens of my iBook & iMac, believe me - I've been in love with that mustard color for months now! (Though it doesn't look as good on my PC's screen). Unfortunately, many others (on PCs or on Macs with CRTs) have given me incredibly strong negative feedback on the color, several actually suggesting it made them nauseous! <br> <br>It's not just that some don't like the color "mustard," but it's also because the less-saturated colors--which I think are often the most interesting--tend to shift more across platforms and monitors than the more saturated colors do. (This same color was seen as orange by some and green by others!) So, I switched to gray on this forum to put the focus on the letterforms and remove the distraction of color, while still approximating the intended value difference. <br> <br>I still need to decide on a color. And although I know that responses to colors are fairly subjective, when so many people respond negatively to something intended for business (and not merely self-expression), I need to take that into consideration. Since on-screen color is more important for me than print, I</div>
