  I've been out of the type seen too long to recognize such an interesting version
  of a double-story \"g\".\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am only looking for the typeface
  of the word \"intelligence.\" Any and all help is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iq2us-logo_5281.png]\r\n\r\n-Sam"
