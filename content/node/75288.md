  by Rub\xE9n Fontana.\r\n\r\nPalestina is a sans serif font designed for reading
  texts and inspired in the condensed Trade Gothic font, which features a strong influence
  from the time of metal foundry -based typography. The characteristic of its design
  allows to offer easily recognizable and very stable words and it has been conceived
  to be used in titles and newspaper and magazine headlines. It is available in five
  colors: Light, regular, Bold, Black and Ultra.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo/palestina/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/palestina_typophile_5476.png]"
