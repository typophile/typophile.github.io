  a symbol they like, but we both agree that the type needs work. Can anyone recommend
  some typefaces that might \"play well\" with the symbol?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

  body: "Well that's strange!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think you need to give us more information.
    What the company does would be a good place to start. Some information on the
    approach you are taking with the identity would also be useful. Why not put an
    image up of the logomark with the type, it makes it difficult to visualize it
    without it there. \r\n\r\nDoes the logo mean anything or is it abstract?"

    thin. At least to me. And at least in this colour. If it was in gray it would
    gain a bit more visual weight.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
