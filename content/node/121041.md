  months ago I picked up Norpeth.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/norpeth/\r\n\r\nI
  noticed on the heavier weights the colon is merged to form one \"dot\". Also, commas
  are vertically compressed to almost appear as periods. I did contact Northern Block
  about this and they said they'd be happy to build a custom font (for a fee, of course).\r\n\r\nQuestion
  is: Has anyone ever seen glyphs designed this way? I like the font but I think I
  need to relegate this to my \"don't use\" folder."

  body: "The colon design is indeed awful. My understanding is that they designed
    the thinnest and the heaviest weights and then automatically interpolated the
    intermediate ones. Something evidently went wrong with the colon and the fact
    that they didn\u2019t check and put it on sale anyway is frankly inexcusable."

  body: Yes, the colon issue is clearly simply a bug. The two outlines need to be
    swapped in one of the master designs to fix the interpolation.

  body: It's a mistake, can happen easily if you're not careful with outlines/components
    matching during interpolation.
