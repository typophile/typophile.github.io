body: "So I started playing around with some letterforms I drew. Initially, my idea
  was to make a unicase typeface; but since everyone would just point out that there's
  little need for unicase fonts, I decided to draw both alphabets (that's not the
  only reason, of course...). However, I did start out with this.\r\n\r\nI have lots
  of problems with many of the characters, most of them I can't quite see how I can
  solve, so what I'm looking for is anything AT ALL that you'd like to share with
  me about this (if you like it, if it's any good, if the world needs it \u2013 you
  know what I mean \u2013, if the stroke thickness is all wrong \u2013 where and why
  would be nice... how to solve it would be excellent \u2013, if some character seems
  out of place, if it reminds you of something, etc.). I mean really anything.\r\n\r\nSome
  things I'd like to add... I drew everything directly on the computer. I know, I
  know... I shouldn't have and that's probably where most of my mistakes come from,
  but I'm going all the way with this and you can't stop me! :P\r\nDon't mind the
  O, I drew that just because I thought the O was too bare in comparison with the
  other characters. It would be an alternate, as would the R, probably. And I will
  do the other alphabet, but am planning to maintain the uppercase at the same height
  as the lowercase, because I really just wanted a way of combining lowercase and
  uppercase letterforms to make separate words look good... you know... I'd use this
  typeface to easily create simple logos (or the starting point for logos), for example,
  or to use as a display face on posters. I kind of always imagine using it on a poster
  for a music festival, with all the separate names of the bands and stuff, although
  I can't quite imagine which kind of music festival would look good in this... :P
  It's just an example.\r\n\r\nThat said, here's the image. There's a lot more to
  say (mainly because I'm all over the place with it), but I guess we'll keep in touch.

  body: "I love unicase fonts.  This is cool.  You might look at the gothic alphabet
    and uncial faces for some inspiration.\r\n\r\nI like the K, Z, T, and H best.
    \r\n\r\nKeep the flair inside the O, just make it a bit smaller, and make it not
    touch the right side of the bowl.\r\n\r\nThe X is falling over to the right.  \r\n\r\nThe
    tail on the Q and R are too different. Pick angular or curved, and run with it.
    \ Same with the Y. \r\n\r\nThe F looks like something mashed it down on the top
    left.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Keep going with this. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"

  body: I like this very much. I think your D, N, and M are a bit lacking in contrast,
    though.

  body: "Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nI know I have to alter most of the characters,
    so it really helps that you singled some out, glyphobet. That way I can tell what's
    more important and noticeable and what's not.\r\nI had kind of thought about the
    tails on Q and R, but I thought they should be different, since I was aiming to
    create a uniqueness on all (or most) of the characters... and also, I really like
    the angular tail on the Q, but think it wouldn't work on the R. Also, this R will
    probably be an alternate, so that wouldn't be that big of a deal... but I will
    think about that (and the Y). Thank you for pointing that out!\r\nYou're right
    about the X and the F \u2013 though I was fond of that top left of the F \u2013
    and I will think about that idea about the O, too.\r\nI'm really glad you liked
    those characters... the T, for instance, was really great, in my head, but when
    I drew it it kind of looked strange and out of balance... I also thought maybe
    the H should be a tad wider and I should do something about the top leg on the
    K (though I still don't know what, exactly); what do you think?\r\n\r\nNow about
    mr: I'm glad you like it!\r\nI did run into a lot of trouble with the N and the
    M... I was thinking the contrast is there on all the characters, but it is a bit
    discreet, so when I thought about the contrast on these letters I didn't want
    to overdo it, because it would be too noticeable... you really think I should
    give them more contrast? Should I focus on making the thin strokes thinner, the
    thick thicker or both?\r\nAbout the D, I'm thinking I should probably make it
    a bit wider, because it's hard to add contrast when the thin part of the stroke
    isn't long enough. Originally it was wider, but the counter looked too open when
    compared with the others...\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again and please, keep'em comin'.

  body: If you thicken it just a bit, it would help. Probably add something like 1/4th
    of the thickness it is now.

    I didn't quite understand what you were trying to say... do you mean you think

  body: "Yeah Ruben, I meant exactly what glyphobet said; the problem was I added
    a 'g' to the word 'thin', producing 'thing'\r\n\r\nBut back to the F, it just
    appears to get a little too straight, it seems to need a little more rounding
    than it currently has, a little more like the top of the S (on a larger scale,
    of course)."
