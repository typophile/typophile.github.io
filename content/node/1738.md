  body: Since you have been able to copy your vectors in, you are halfway there. <BR>
    <BR>The size you can control by drawing or scaling the original glyph in Illustrator.
    <BR> <BR>Position the glyph so that it aligns with the bottom and left side of
    the page size you are using in Illustrator. This corressponds to the baseline
    and left side bearing in Fontlab. &#40;At least it does when I use U.S. Letter&#41;

  body: There is no big need to position glyph relative to the bottom-left corner
    of the page. Instead you can move &#34;zero&#34; point &#40;which will be &#34;zero&#34;
    in FontLab&#41; to any place on your page. Drag it from rectangle that exists
    on intersection of rulers in Illustrator document window.

  body: If you are on Mac, then the easy way to put full alphabet &#40;as a single
    Illustrator picture&#41; into FontLab is to use ScanFont 4. Try the demo version
    and you will see what I mean :-&#41;

  body: 'Another thing I wonder about is the whole baseline, grid thing etc. inside
    FL. Someone can explain this a little? And maybe how to set it up if needed....
    <BR> <BR>And: The placement and size of the glyphs inside FL depends on how things
    are set up inside Illustrator - I get that as well as the zero point fix. But
    when I copy my glyps from Illu. the are pretty tiny inside FL eventhough they
    are almost a4 size in Illu. Is this normal or are there any advice here?'
