  be applied together on each precomposed character to get composed variants when
  applying features such as 'c2sc', 'smcp', etc.?\r\nHow do font renderers handle
  'ccmp' and 'liga' when together?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe test program (TrueTypeViewer)
  shows the desired behaviour. For example \xC2 (Acircumflex, ccmp: A + uni0302, liga:
  A + uni0302) is always rendered as \xC2 (circumflex) when the default 'ccmp' and
  'liga' for latn are enabled. When applying 'c2sc' the desired composed smallcap
  \xC2 (A.small + uni0302) is displayed.\r\n\r\nWould this work on most systems? Do
  some display the precomposed forms instead of the composed ones when not advanced
  feature is applied?\r\nHow do you deal with advanced features for tons of precomposed
  characters?"

  body: "> Can \u2018ccmp\u2019 and \u2018liga\u2019 be applied together\r\n\r\nAny
    features can be applied together. In such case, the order of the lookups in the
    font decides which substitutions or positionings are applied first. \r\n\r\nBut
    what do you want to put into the liga feature? A + uni0302 is not really a substitution
    that should be placed in the liga feature because Acircumflex is not a ligature.
    If you intend to hack the OpenType spec, of course you can still do it but keep
    in mind that your font will considered a hack. \r\n\r\n> Do some display the precomposed
    forms instead of \r\n> the composed ones when not advanced feature is applied?\r\n\r\nYes,
    some applications apply the Unicode canonical composition process on the text
    string level, i.e. before the OpenType Layout processing is triggered. Some applications
    may also perform canonical reordering. \r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that \"ccmp\"
    can be realized through substitutions but you can also add \"mark\" and \"mkmk\"
    features that position diacritical marks through GPOS. Your \"ccmp\" will be supported
    in a larger percentage of applications, e.g. TextEdit on Mac OS X 10.4 or InDesign
    non-Middle East while \"mark\" will be supported only in savvy applications e.g.
    Notepad on Windows XP SP-2, Word or InDesign Middle East. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    but surely it's much better to include these features (that use anchors, obviously).
