  body: I think your weight is good - but they are a bit too narrow.  <BR>Try scaling
    horizontally, maybe 105%.

  body: The second one is getting a little bit too dark. I guess it&#39;s a toss-up
    between width, weight, and the extra MM effort you mention. I&#39;d just go with
    your first setting, if that&#39;s all you&#39;ll use the smallcaps for. But if
    you&#39;re going to use a lot of smallcaps in text, do go for the wider style,
    assuming you can match the weight better - since you have the Pro, you could try
    using a larger optical cut of the font, which will be slightly lighter. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, I did the second version using MM width and weight scaling. I don&#39;t
    believe Myriad has an optical axis, and if there is an adjustment for optical
    scaling in the Pro version, I&#39;ve not found it. To date, these are the only
    places I&#39;ve used small caps in this project. I&#39;m a bit apprehensive, as
    the further I stray from the stock font, the more likely at some point it will
    come back and bite me. That said, I take note of small things in typography, and
    try my best to do it right.

    I thought that was the semi. In that case just lighten the smallcaps weight a
