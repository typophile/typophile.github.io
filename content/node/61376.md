  body: I like the type better than the old but I don't think they should have changed
    the logo. The shininess detracts from its elegance imo.

    part of German Automotive traditions, just look at rivals Mercedes and BMW, neither
    has ever changed their logos. \r\n\r\nJon. "

  body: '@imageWIS / Jon, maybe I seem to be wrong but I believe BMW at least updated
    their logo throughout history a couple of times. see [[http://www.bmwcoop.com/2009/01/11/bmw-logo-history/]].
    After a bit more of google It seems that mercedes also did change it''s logo a
    lot throughout history: [[http://www.designstrom.com/corporate-brand-logo-evolution/]]
    (scroll down to number 16)'

    Aspecially for the new <a href="http://autoya.info/audi_r10_concept_car_2010/"
    alt="audi r10 concept">audi r10 concept</a> at least. The new logo is better -
    for me
