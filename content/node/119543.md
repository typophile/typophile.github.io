  The postwar era, in my opinion, shaped almost all aspects of the present modern
  design, organized by grids, driven by scientific psycho-biology researches and aiming
  for the maximum efficiency and responsibility. They seem to be totally fine for
  me, but I am more curious, after working for a letterpress artist & typographer,
  about whether there are alternative choices to Helvetica (and all other postwar
  rational movements it epitomizes)?\r\n\r\nThe design program I attend has filled
  its list with many Helveticas, starting from Josef Muller-Brockmann to Tschichold\u2019s
  Die Neue Typographie (except for Bringhurst). I wonder if there are other design
  books that do not necessarily follow this trend."

    modernist narrative is a canon for critics (it\u2019s glamorous) and educators
    (it\u2019s easy to teach), not historians. See my essay in Codex 3 for a debunking."

  body: "Helvetica is a good typeface but can look a little dated due to its heavy
    use a few decades ago. But it's still used a lot (for example Apple uses it) and
    the general public may not pick up on the overuse as much as designers do.\r\n\r\nMost
    designers I know who use Helvetica today (because it's their client's corporate
    font) tend towards the lighter weights (and sometimes condensed) which can look
    more contemporary than the bolder weights.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly there are many
    alternatives to Helvetica."
