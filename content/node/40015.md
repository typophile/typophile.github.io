body: "in an earlier thread i was trying to find a family of fonts that started quite
  plain and became ornate. i'm thinking a good way to solve my problem is to use a
  family start goes from sans serif to serif. the typeface that is perfect is called
  rotis. but it's \xA3194. i can't afford it. does anyone know of any more affordable
  alternatives?"

    guessing that's about as affordable as you're going to find for a full family
    of fonts that does what you're describing."

  body: "Hi Emma,\r\n\r\n<cite>why is rotis ugly?</cite>\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a whole
    award-winning book on this topic; <a href=\"http://www.typografie.de/verlagsverzeichnis/typografie/717-3.html\">rotis
    \u2013 eine Streitschrift </a> by Christian Hartig & Ralph Burkhardt. [The book
    title\u2019s pun is lost in translation: \u2018Streitschrift\u2019 means \u2018(polemic)
    pamphlet\u2019 <em>and</em> \u2018controversial typeface\u2019]\r\n\r\n[[Rotis]],
    designed in 1988 by [[Otl Aicher]], tried to bridge the gap between Sans and Serif.
    It soon became heavily debated and generated polarized opinions. Some found its
    hybrid system very useful for corporate communication, and so Rotis consequently
    was used extensively to embody \u2018solidity\u2019.\r\n\r\nOthers dispised Aicher\u2019s
    design, claiming he was a great designer (most notably: 1972 Olympics in Munich),
    but just not a proper <em>type</em> designer. Rotis is said to be defective in
    running text, as it has a distinctive vertical stress and therefore tends to form
    undesirable columns.\r\n\r\nEspecially the \u2018smiling\u2019 (or \u2018keeling
    over\u2019) lowercase \u2018e\u2019 gets lots of love and hate.\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    Rotis type family was developed much from Aicher\u2019s own theories on typography
    and readability, and as such, works better in concept than in practical application.</cite>\r\n\u2014
    Norbert Florendo in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/15785\">this thread</a>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    exactly what we call a \u2018Kopfgeburt\u2019 in German \u2013 a mere mind game,
    useless in practice. \r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\n[edit] Oh, I knew I had read this \u2018Kopfgeburt\u2019
    attributed to Rotis somewhere else: [[Robin Kinross]] and [[Erik Spiekermann]]
    on <a href=\"http://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1109747452/E1829097339/index.html\">Is
    Rotis a typeface?</a>\r\n"
