  body: "I'd guess that some sort of 'transplanted' f needed to be used because the
    first version had too much descender for the design. The 'new' f certainly has
    a rather grotesque f-shape, don't you think? The proportions are very odd, but
    do avoid the AMADEUS letters pretty well.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
