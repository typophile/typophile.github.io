  body: "Typophile's search feature has been basically non-functional for a very long
    time. The workaround used to be to use Google with \"site:typophile.com whatever\",
    but even that has become unreliable for some time now. Very frustrating.\r\n\r\nIf
    the search feature worked, you would be able to find many threads similar to this,
    except that if it worked, there wouldn't be threads like this."

    Apologies for leaving it broken for so long. Some bugs are more tenacious than
    others.\r\n"
