  body: what a shocker, on the subject of trains the ticker on my train to and from
    work really annoys me with raised descenders in line with the baseline. Are there
    any other signage blunders out there I wonder?

  body: "Looks to me like someone drew a pencil line and then aligned all the characters
    to that line, regardless of whether they have an optical correction or not. A
    minor sin compared to dzp's note: where descenders are also placed above the baseline.\r\n\r\nI
    remember using letraset back in the day, and then they had little lines so that
    one would align the letters correctly. Perhaps this kit was a clone that does
    not have that nicety, or the applier just ignored them (possibly not understanding
    them). \"Hey, why should I waste my time reading instructions.\""

    train ride and the fallen-over o's representing what might happen to riders if
    they don't follow the sign's advice.\r\n\r\n;-)"

    out a camera on the subway! Probably a cellphone camera LOL (You know, to call
    911 quickly.)

  body: The risk of taking out your camera on the subway isn't becoming a crime victim
    (I don't think crime is up) but of becoming a criminal. Mayor Dollarsign has made
    taking photos on the subway illegal.

    themselves in a dark room suppose to do now? (It really was an assignment at one
    time...)"

  body: I had that assignment too - but that was in the day when you really were putting
    yourself at risk by taking your camera out in the subway. Of course the subways
    were much more interesting to photograph then too. As Bruce Davidson amply demonstrated.

    in various companies are not qualified. So this person who placed this sticker
    there has a great imagination..
