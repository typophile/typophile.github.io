  <BR> <BR>The Seriatim Family is a system of geometric sans serifs in four surprisingly
  interchangeable styles: <BR> <BR>1. Upright, the most conservative set; <BR> <BR>2.
  Normal; <BR> <BR>3. Roundform; and <BR> <BR>4. Alternates, generally the most daring
  set. <BR> <BR> <BR>Many of the characters have an ability to form natural ligatures
  between them, especially in the Normal and Alternate sets. <BR> <BR>Not all of the
  characters have unique glyphs in each of the four sets, but many do. For example,
  there is one design for lower-case &#34;i&#34;, but there are 4 designs for Upper-Case
  &#34;E&#34; -- 7, actually, if you count the 3 unique &#34;sigma&#34; glyphs, which
  function well as display upper-case &#34;E&#34;s. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still fine-tuning
  many aspects, such as kerning and hinting. <BR> <BR>The font was designed with display
  applications in mind, but the Normal and Upright versions, especially, seem to compare
  roughly to Kabel, Futura, and the like for short text applications. &#40;No, I wouldn&#39;t
  set a book in it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
  &#41; <BR> <BR>I have tried to design enough original characters to justify yet
  another geometric face. As I pushed myself to find new geometric ways to portray
  the various glyphs, I arrived at some rather unexpected solutions -- many of those
  ended up in the Alternates set, but a few of them were unique enough yet readable
  enough to be placed in the other sets. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still toying with the designs
  as well, of course, so nothing is set in stone as yet. <BR> <BR>Comments very much
  desired, and will be appreciated! <BR> <BR>David'

  body: ' David, congrats on a wonderful system!  <BR>Where the kabel, avenir, avant
    garde,  <BR>futura systems are predictable  <BR>stay-at-home types, Seriatim is
    a loose <BR>geometric looking for some action. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve executed something
    on a high level, <BR>a level approaching Hoefler&#39;s Proteus or  <BR>House&#39;s
    Chalet systems. <BR> <BR>Your attention to detail is superb, <BR>as always. <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s so much here to talk about  <BR>so I&#39;ll pinpoint some areas
    that  <BR>I like/dislike. <BR> <BR>DTD Seratim -- My favorites are the uc K, Q
    <BR>and R, and the lc g.  <BR>The oblique M, V and W are reminiscent of avant
    <BR>garde alternates, but the perhaps the V and W <BR>could be less oblique. As
    you pair letters, <BR>there&#39;s going to be a pronounced gap with these. <BR>Maybe
    6 degrees of separation might work. Your <BR>extended characters are great. <BR>
    <BR>DTD Seriatim Upright - This is the most  <BR>textworthy and the one that adheres
    to a <BR>geometric convention of past faces. <BR>I like the uc J wide like that.  <BR>The
    uc Q seems to call for an alternate.  <BR>The numbers 6 and 9...they seem a bit
    odd  <BR>for some reason. <BR> <BR>Seriatim Roundforms -- This face is worth the
    price of admission by itself.  <BR>Every letter except for &#39;I&#39; and &#39;V&#39;
    uses rounded forms. What a treat. <BR>Your ampersand is darling.  <BR>Don&#39;t
    kill your darlings. <BR> <BR>Seriatim Alternates -- I like a lot of the stuff  <BR>here,
    including the feel of the lower case.  <BR>I&#39;d like to see some different
    treatments on  <BR>the some of the plain uppercase letters. D E F etc. <BR>I like
    the experimental uc K and R, but the <BR>uc P and the uc Z are not my favorites.

    pose a problem, but because of the geometric nature of the font, I want to follow
    Lubalin&#39;s lead as in Avant Garde Gothic and keep all of the oblique strokes
    as uniform as possible in their angles. In other words, I want to keep the diagonals
    parallel to each other as much as possible. Granted this creates a kerning challenge,
    but if I am careful, I hope to catch all of the possible combinations. <BR> <BR>The
    sample above shows how many of the characters fit together, and some combinations
    for their own ligatures naturally &#40;as the Seriatim &#34;LY&#34; combination
    does&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; DTD Seriatim Upright -  <BR>&#62; The uc Q seems to

    <BR> <BR>Heh heh... Well, we could choose between &#34;Seriatim&#34; and &#34;Mellifluous&#34;...
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> Actually,
    the more I say the name &#34;Seriatim&#34;, the more lyric it sounds to my ear.
    But I am prejudiced, admittedly. Does anyone else have an opinion on the name?
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments &amp; encouragement! <BR> <BR>Stephen: <BR> <BR>Thanks
    to you too! <BR> <BR>&#62; &not; The Seriatim &#39;a&#39; dark join distracts  <BR>&#62;
    from the color of the rest of the glyphs. <BR> <BR>I agree, and I&#39;m taking
    steps to minimize this without changing the structure too much, mostly by extending
    the counter&#39;s light trap up further into the join area, thinning the two strokes
    slightly as they come together. <BR> <BR>&#62; &not; The Upright &#39;s&#39; looks
    feeble. Can&#39;t  <BR>&#62; add some width?  <BR> <BR>I could try, but I don&#39;t
    want to depart too much from the basic geometry. It&#39;s the same lc &#34;s&#34;
    as it used in the Seriatim &#40;normal&#41; set, and it essentially the same structure
    as Avant Garde Gothic, Kabel, and &#40;to a lesser extent&#41; Futura. I&#39;ll
    try adding a bit of a straight horizontal stroke between the curves to see if
    it works. <BR> <BR>As far as those &#34;6&#34; and &#34;9&#34; glyphs, As bj notes,
    the extenders are pretty strong, but I think Stephen may have a point. I tried
    for a different form &#40;although the more angular Futura forms are available
    in the Seriatim Alternates set&#41; so it looks unusual. I think they work pretty
    well with the other figures, especially the &#34;3&#34;, &#34;5&#34;, &#34;8&#34;
    and &#34;0&#34;. Anyone have other views on this? <BR> <BR>&#62; &not; As to be

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m conflicted about the lc aesc &#40;&#34;ae&#34; ligature&#41;.
    I agree that the stem helps identify the glyphs, but it also made it really dark
    -- and it doesn&#39;t seem to belong, especially in an italic. I&#39;ll tinker
    with it again and see if I can reach a better solution. I&#39;m avoiding a sloped
    roman &#34;a&#34; form. <BR> <BR>David '

    alt="SeriatimOrnamentsLR.gif"> <BR> <BR>Most of the symbols for which it is appropriate
    <BR>have reversed counterparts as well, such as <BR>the pointing fists, arrows,
    et al. <BR> <BR>There are also more basic glyphs, such as <BR>geometric shapes

    I&#39;d like to see more weights, maybe a swash set and small caps too.  <BR>

    have several swash characters. As for Seriatim Nouveau and Seriatim Arts &amp;

  body: 'Stephen: Heh -- That&#39;s because the upper and lower halves are the same-size
    curve, and it hasn&#39;t been optically adjusted. It was an intentional experiment
    at the time, but lately &#40;and now especially with your comment&#41;, I think
    I agree that the top needs to be slightly smaller and the bottom slightly larger.
    Primer uses probably the strictest geometry of all of the Seriatim tribe, with
    optical adjustments kept to a minimum. Toward that end, are there any areas where
    I should incorporate more adjustments, specifically to Primer, but to any of the
    displayed glyphs in any of the sets? <BR> <BR>Any other comments? I know there
    must be other adjustments needed.... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    also noticed that most of my &#34;@&#34; symbols need to be made bigger, letting
    the swoop descend under the baseline. <BR> <BR>Thanks to everyone for the comments
    so far! Anything else will be most appreciated, as always. <BR> <BR>David'
