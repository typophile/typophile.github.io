  body: "Ricard0, had never heard of that site before. Some really great stuff on
    there that I'll have to spend way more time looking through.\r\n\r\nMonmeehan,
    that was my first inclination that it was custom. Wouldn't be surprised if it
    came from Darden Studios that they've worked with in the past. I'm really digging
    that Quimby font you linked. Really nice and quirky."
