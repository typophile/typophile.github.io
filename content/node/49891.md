body: "Hi everyone !\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve found this grotesque in a dutch book from 1939\r\n\r\nSome
  letters have specific details : G, R, g, a\r\nIt\u2019s a sans serif font with contrasted
  letters : p, n, q, u, a (but not lower case r)\r\nAlso, the egg shape of letter
  O, C, o, e, and the squarish part of letters j, t, a, f\r\nIt seems that the only
  letter that has a terminal going back inside the shape is the capital J\r\n\r\na
  gothic from an american foundry or a british one ?\r\n\r\nany ideas ?\r\ncheers

    was not among the Lineales. The odd G, which has a 'beard' but nor 'chin',  or
    'jaw', seems vaguely familiar, but I couldn't find it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "\r\nThanks Mike for your reply\r\nyes, the G is weird. and if it has a \"beard\",
    the letter R has a leg and a foot for sure !\r\n\r\nI still haven't found what
    this typeface is\u2026\r\nI hope to find it out soon and come here to post it\r\n\r\nH"
