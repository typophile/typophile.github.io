  body: If you're working on a text weight shouldn't you be worrying more about how
    well it sets in it's intended size? I don't see text being set in anything close
    to the size you have the 'larger' version at in the GIF.

    body: Good point. As a novice type designer, I should probably be happy if I can
      get it to work at one size well.

  body: "I would suggest increasing the height of your e, and adding just the tiniest
    bit more contrast to the f, o, s, t, i, and v so that they're more consistent
    with the contrast in h, a, m, b, u, r, g, e, & n.  I think it's less of a problem
    at the smaller sizes, but that it would help the color to be more even.\r\n\r\n--Jim

    that text fonts, at least the really good ones, are\r\nsupposed to look kinda
    dorky when set large.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n1) Decide what size you intend this to be
    used at.\r\n2) Tell us.\r\n3) Prodvide a PDF.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The tail of the u looks just a little short to me. I second the e being out
    of place. And may I say you have very nice typeface right here. I realy like your
    "g".

  body: "It looks like that your letter 'v' is irrelevant compared with others, maybe
    a little curve at the base would emphasize the roundness style and the width of
    'h,' 'u,' 'n' should be equal. Hmm... maybe the spacing between each letter should
    be a little extended to enhance legibility at small point size. And I personally
    love your 'e'.\r\n--- pinky kinky winky ---"

    a closer look.

  body: The e is probably bothering people because it seems like it's leaning slightly
    and it's drawn like an italic e. I think it's important that you keep the italic
    structure; you've done a really elegant job of pairing it with a geometric treatment
    and to me that's really the promising feature of these letters. Just tilting it
    slightly back into balance will (hopefully) resolve that issue...
