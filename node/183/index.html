		<div class="commentbody">Christos, good stuff. ;) <BR> <BR>The first one is the one I like more. It's subtler and  <BR>more &quot;graphical&quot; than the other options. The stencil  <BR>typeface, I like it a lot (what typeface is it?). <BR>The second one has a good idea, but it seems you  <BR>couldn't develop it further. <BR>I kinda dislike Clarendon used in the third one.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, now I've been spurred to critique, which is not to say that I don't love these posters anymore. <BR> <BR>I found I didn't like the first as much as the others, though I agree with Eduardo that is is more subtle, and feels more dynamic in layout (and I like the marching lemming soldiers). I think it just stands out as so different from the others. And since the others were pretty clear, and I don't like to think, I felt more comfortable with them. <BR> <BR>The one thing now that stands out is the vector details (bubbles, blood drop) in the blood tub poster. I'm inclined to like the contrast with the rough illustrations, but since it doesn't happen anywhere else (I think), it seems a little out of place. <BR> <BR>I do like the Clarendon (I'm assuming it's Clarendon from Eduardo's post, since I'm not a top-notch typeface id-er. I've never seen Clarendon with Greek characters, but I might be showing my ignorance) in #3. It gives the type a nice structure for the more chaotic illustration to play off of (Unlike #2 &amp; 4, where the type kind of blends in). Plus, I've been falling in love with Clarendon again these days. <BR> <BR>But I still think these posters are swell! Wouldn't mind a set for my wall. Sorry for the selayed crit. I told you, I don't like to think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the only thing that really stands out as problematic to  <BR>me is the *bubbles* on the bloody bath version. every <BR>other element (in the others as well) is very rough and  <BR>expressive; the bubbles, however, are very light,  <BR>precise, and almost whimsical in a teenage girl sort of  <BR>way. the digital precision of the blood also seems to  <BR>conflict a bit, but not so much as the lightness in the  <BR>former. <BR> <BR>on the whole, you've done a fine job of capturing the  <BR>intriguing, lively quality of mid-20th cent modernism. it  <BR>has a very Saul Bass mood without sacrificing your own  <BR>voice.</div>

This is the strength of Jarry's puerile masterpiece: identifying  as the ultimate abiding insult to bourgeois aspiration. In this regard the situation at the start of the 21st century is pretty much equivalent to the end of the 19th. Recent representations of man-in-league-with- hardly compare.  Mr. Hanky (or Kricfalusi's urHanky, &quot;Knutty the friendly dump&quot;) is a commodified leakage from Ubu's chamber pot. <BR> <BR>Anyway, love the posters (I like 1 and 3 most). Good work! <BR> <BR>BTW, I made an &quot;Ubu centennial&quot; series of sketchbooks in 1996 playing with the spiral, belly, hood and hat forms of Jarry's original drawings; must do something with those at some point&hellip; <BR></div>
