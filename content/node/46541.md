  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_standard_0_6645.gif]\r\nit looks
    like it might have started life as Serif Gothic\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/serif-gothic/heavy/\r\n\r\nwith
    some modifications that have made it a bit of an eyesore.\r\n\r\nor maybe it's
    a 1001-fonts knockoff of Serif Gothic? (different B, N and an alt-E)\r\n\r\n"

  body: The original Serif Gothic had an E like that. IIRC. But that B looked tortured
    so you're probably right that this is a knock-off.
