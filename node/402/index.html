<div class=commentbody>I live right here in Minneapolis and have made plans to attend the conference. Unfortunately, I have not signed up for any of the workshops since I'm broke as a joke having just graduated college with no real job prospects. <br> <br>As far as antiquarian bookstores go, I'm not the greatest person to ask, but I do know of a few. <br> <br>There's a store downtown on Nicolet Mall (pronounced NICK-eh-let, don't ask why) called James and Mary Laurie booksellers. I haven't perused their book selection, but they have a huge basement full of classical and jazz records. <br> <br>There's another large store equidistant from the two downtowns on University ave called Midway Used and Rare Books. <a href=http://www.midwaybook.com/>Here's their website</a> so you can check it out in advance. <br> <br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, <br> <br>I have had experience with only a few antiquarian book shops in the area. <br> <br>(1) Rulon-Miller is located in St. Paul; they have a nice typography selection, but are open by appointment only: <br><a href=http://www.rulon.com target=_blank>http://www.rulon.com</a> <br>(approx. 7 miles from hotel) <br> <br>(2) Lien's, in Minneapolis, is close to the hotel, and is also very good... <br><a href=http://www.liensbooks.com target=_blank>http://www.liensbooks.com</a> <br>(approx. 2 miles from hotel) <br> <br>(3) A lot of people like Magers & Quinn, too: <br><a href=http://www.citypages.com/bestof2000/boughtandsold/bestof828.asp target=_blank>http://www.citypages.com/bestof2000/boughtandsold/bestof828.asp</a> <br>(approx. 3 miles from hotel) <br> <br>(4) Finally, Loome Antiquarian Booksellers is 30 minutes out of the Twin Cities, but well worth the trip: <br><a href=http://www.loomebooks.com/booktown/valley.html target=_blank>http://www.loomebooks.com/booktown/valley.html</a> <br>(approx. 25 miles from hotel) <br> <br>Twin Citians: This list is undoubtedly incomplete; please add your favorites! <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jared and I will be there -- a first for both of us. We're <br>speaking at the "Panel Discussion on Type and Design <br>Blogs and Online Communities" on Saturday at 4pm. <br>Come and cheer us on or throw vegetables as you see fit. <br> <br>We'd love to get together for an informal Typophile <br>gathering.

<div class=commentbody>I'll be there. It will be my first, too. I feel lucky that it's right in my neck of the woods and that I was able to be involved in it. It will be great to finally meet in person so many people I have gotten to know online. (We designed the name tags to be readable more than two feet away.) <br> <br>I'm attending three of the workshops: The Glass Guilding Demo and Paper Banner Demo on Thursday, and Ken Barber's workshop on Friday. There were other workshops I wanted to do, but many of them were being held at the same time. It was a tough choice, but I think I would have been happy no matter what I picked. <br> <br>I still have a ton of stuff to do before the conference and I'm at a family reunion for almost a week beforehand. Busy, busy, busy. See you there!</div>

I have a friend in Minneapolis that I might be staying with - he's got the goods on some places too, namely, we wanna go and hang with Prince at Pasley Palace. but anywho...if I make it - I'll be the girl with ridiculously long red ponytails - come get me!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ahhh Paisley Park. <br> <br>If you get there on the right night you might just get in to see prince perform on his tiny sound stage for free. I don't think he has done too many shows lately though, and after a year of trying to guess which night he was going to play, I finally gave up. His studio and home are in Chanhassen, about 30 min from downtown. If you're a prince fanatic it might be worth the pilgramige.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Guess what, typefolk! <br> <br>I am most likely going to be attendance - sans fontlover buttons/stickers, so don't bug me for them. I'm posting regarding the somewhat vague information on admission fees. Is there just a one-time registration fee covering the whole conference or is there an additional fee that must be paid daily? I know workshops are seperate and cost money, but I need to know how much I'm going to be dishing out. <br> <br>ALSO, if anyone is not aware, I will probably be the youngest attendee (If I make it there). I appear 21 but am actually 18....not that I drink or anything.... <br> <br>Is anyone also aware of any financial corners that can be cut (i.e. volunteering for admisson, kerning fonts, whoring a foundry, etc.)? I approached Tamye with some suggestions but she never replied to my e-mail(I'm assuming she's busy heh). <br> <br>Any info would be appreciated!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Milan, the admission fee is one price for the main conference. There are no additional charges except for optional workshops. <br> <br>We had plenty of volunteer positions available earlier, but all those spots are filled. Sadly, we have no fonts to kern. I don't know about "whoring" a foundry - you'll have to approach the individual companies and see what kind of response you get. Using slightly different terminology would be more likely to produce positive results. <br> <br>FYI, the first email I've ever received from you arrived late Thursday night. I replied to you yesterday afternoon before taking a few hours off to see the fireworks with my little boy. Shocking, I know ;) <br> <br>If you're going to TypeCon, be sure and register by Tuesday - it's only $125 for 3 days of typographic goodness, and some free munchies for starving type-aholics like yourself. After Tuesday, late registration is $200. <br> <br></div>
