body: "Hi guy's\r\n\r\nJust got this job for a close friend of mine starting up a
  coffee shop. he just wants a simple logo type identity nothing fancy, but it really
  is proving difficult to select an appropriate type face that sits well with all
  the letter forms for the company name chosen as its quite repetitive in terms of
  letters. the company name is ( COFFEE-CORNER ) chosen by him not me and yes ive
  tried to get him to change it buts thats what he wants, and yes you guessed it the
  shop is on the corner of the parade :)\r\n\r\nso as i mentioned above its repetitive
  in letter form with 2 c's, 2 o's, 3 e's, 2 f's, 2 r's which is making is a challenge
  to select a face that sits well with those characters as a name. geometric form
  is working ok but looks bland and its to over used.I  wouldn't mind exploring creative
  ligature use for the double ff or double e possibly?\r\n\r\nthe business will do
  both coffee and food and the typeface will have to reflect that too.\r\n\r\nas its
  mates rates the budget is quite high for the font purchase ;)\r\n\r\nso type experts
  any suggestions to a solid typeface thats gonna brings this name to life?\r\n\r\nI
  look forward to your suggestions."

    paying money for the coffee. :-)  What kind of <em>customers</em> is your friend
    shooting for? <em>That</em> will determine a good direction more than anything
    else.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "wow 2 fonts at both ends of the spectrum, thats interesting. I can see the
    attributes both could bring to the identity. I was expecting there to be some
    consistency in selections but its great to see such a degree in variation.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    if a few more people muck in I can get at least a selection of 10 fonts together
    to make a choice.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."
