  body: 'About your sample: I think it&#39;s the Adobe version &#40;straight lines&#41;
    and not the Oblique but a manually slanted and extended Roman. I&#39;d try it
    out, but my license is the Bitstream version --which is much better digitized
    BTW &#40;slightly curved lines&#41; - so it won&#39;t match.'
