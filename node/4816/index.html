Guess I should take a good look at some of those old photofilm/offset manuals I've got laying around. This is of some concern, but probably only to me, so thanks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd agree with you that the hand punchcutter would not have been concerned with optical scaling as it would have been a natural organic process to them. As it is for a calligrapher. Calligraphers don't change to a fatter brush or pen when they are working with different sizes of letterforms. These restrictions have been forced on us by the mechanical.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes, perhaps, it is best to look at the origins and rationalize forward from there, rather than backward from here.

		<div class="commentbody">Addison. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tell me this, Mr. Giampa. Frederic Goudy cut his own type, right? Did he anticipate the finer execution of printing that you expect? In other words, do you feel your digital versions of his types live up to his (Goudy's) expectations of his metal types? And please, this is no attack&ndash;I just want to know your opinion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1.)

Well, if he liked Photocomp I see no reason he would not like digital type.

He would prefer, I predict, Ikarus over Fontographer or FontLab for outlining. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know I do, I know Jim does.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald G. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably not a good idea to hold hands with the dead - they may not appreciate it. An old saying. I suspect though that Goudy's interest in designing was at the forefront over other concerns he had and most likely he would have gladly participated in the digital world. Especially so because of the residuals!!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the step by step on how you digitized the patterns. There were some Monotype patterns up on eBay a while back (Felicity). $360, no reserve, and they went unsold. Hard to believe. By the way, don't give away those Californians. You asked me a while back about an institutional home. I believe I now have found one. This will have to be offlist. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I gave up completely on metal about five or six years ago. Partly I was quite enthused about the direction of digital type, of which you were an inspirational factor, and partly I found the process eliminated a lot of the restrictions imposed by metal type technology. Not a bad thing to have learned those restrictions mind you. But, more importantly, had I not fully gone over to photopolymer, I would be plumb out of business. You more than most, would understand the problems that maintaining a shop of metal type related technology imposes in this regard.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, photopolymer as a type form does not have the je ne sais quoi of metal, but my concern has always been the printed page rather than idle homage to technology. I'd rather be stirring the cauldron than watching from the cheering and/or jeering crowd. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald L. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I never said calligraphy is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->easier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than type design - that's moot. I'm looking at it from the viewpoint of the user/reader, who could care less what tools you enjoy fondling and what your childhood was like. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In calligraphy, the lack of variance in stroke thickness with respect to size is a problem when it comes to optimal letterform quality. Because type design is non-instantaneous, it allows for the considered, conscious control of things like weight (and its ideal distribution). This should be obvious. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the answers, in the end. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll wait for news on the optical scaling software, etc. Thanks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; You may need better glasses. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have 20/15 vision. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; not until you and I determine the best way to go with optical scaling. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I thought I didn't know anything? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But lacking a fancy method to streamline the selection of optically-correct fonts from a typeface family, providing separate fonts isn't so bad - remember that optical scaling is a specialist thing, and specialists are usually willing to make the extra effort. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Lanston's Californian is the most authentic vesion of Goudy's Californian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At one point size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; photopolymer as a type form does not have the je ne sais quoi of metal <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I found metal type a lot of fun, but: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Mostly just to fondle; actually setting metal type is pretty pissy. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Only in larger sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I was doing my ATF Garamond cascade the smaller sizes were nothing but displeasure to work with (not to mention all the spacing matter you have to struggle with - it feels so pointless).

The refinement matrices had to be placed in the assembler by the operator by hand, and if was not done it was simply for lack of caring or for lack of the special refinement mats. Much work done on the Linotype was good by any standard. If there were a few inherent weaknesses in the technology, there seems little to be gained in lamenting it now. The Linotype, like other composing machines that preceded was the result of a gradual progression toward excellence and production.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am certain that 30 years from now the same kind of stuff will be said about the very best of what is available to us today in typography. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Without Buddy Bolden there would have been no popular music as we know it now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer</div>

I think that was in the early 1980s. I bought near a cabinet's worth of all sizes available (I can't remember what the range of sizes were though). It was a joy to work with and we did a couple of books and various other printed pieces with it before I sold it off. Quite nice were the small caps that ran all the way up to 36-point.

		<div class="commentbody">My comments were not intended to be an attack on letterpress at all. Done well, letterpress was and remains great. I too have a great affection for it: we had a little Adana hand press at school were we used to produce much of the jobbing work (letterheads, business cards etc) the school needed, and I loved it and all that went with it. Needless to say, our efforts were terrible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My only point: sometimes letterpress is over-romanticized. There is a tendency to compare the average mediocre of today with the best letterpress of yesterday. That is not a fair comparison. Getting letterpress right was hard. It required taste and judgment at every stage: in design, in composition, in printing. It also had (at least in some forms of the technology) some real drawbacks typographically &ndash; poorly fitted Linotype italics being, one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Printing has always had its nostalgic element. In the early 20th century, people looked back on handsetting, hand presswork, dampened paper and so on. &quot;Machine typesetting and high-volume printing,&quot; they said to themselves, &quot;what a falling away from the glories of the past.&quot; No doubt there were people who sadly lamented the decline of calligraphy in the face of movable type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And of course, they were in one sense right. But I cannot help feeling that there is another story to tell. For with each technological change, though something has been lost, there has also been something gained. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far as the move from metal typesetting to &quot;flat&quot; typesetting is concerned, of course there are losses. But they are not all to be regretted, especially if one looks at the quality of the average printed item, not the very best or worst. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The really important thing is to work out what the important losses are, and whether they are really necessary. Many of the losses that have been made in the move from letterpress to litho, and in digitization, are not inevitable. With experience, designers of type for photographic composition can produce good designs. It is hardly surprising that in the infancy of that particular art some poor digitization took place, and some noble faces (Centaur, Bembo, Baskerville) were &ndash; perhaps only temporarily &ndash; vastly diminished. The real pity now is that with so much that is good and designed specifically for digital setting, the pallid ghosts of these old faces continue to haunt so many pages. Optical sizing (where it matters: I suspect it is now being overdone; a sceptic like Hrant might like to note that it is very much in the economic interests of digital foundries to push optical variants) can be recovered. Ligatures have always been there to be used, and only laziness or ignorance limits their proper use. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The real loss may be the loss of craft. Digitization democratizes type. It blurs the distinction between the amateur and the professional, and between the trained and experienced professional and the novice. As software becomes more skilful in saving us from the mistakes of ignorance, the value of craft knowledge is reduced. Mr Rimmer is right to say: &quot;Those errors you point to are failures of technique&quot;. So they are. And in saying that, he has behind him the legitimate pride of the craftsman who has had to learn that technique and who feels, however dimly, the massed generations of those by whom the technique was developed and handed down. Digitization threatens to cut that link with the past, and reduced (not, of course, eliminated&ndash;by no means) the significance of craft training and skills. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is this, which is a cultural and human question, that seems to me to be the core issue digitization poses &ndash; not the mere &quot;loss&quot; of a few old typefaces, or optical sizes, or faked small capitals. Those are problems that can easily enough be solved. But craft skills (which are learned but not taught, largely unwritten, and largely incommunicable in writing) once lost are hard to recover. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(This, of course, is not a new problem. It is the constant problem posed by industrialization. It is no less real for that, even if I do sound like William Morris.)</div>

I read a technical report where it was suggested as 5%. &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald&ndash;I was wondering where you might have read this? While I have noticed that different types of plate material seem to gain differently during platemaking  (case in point, a Printight plate I processed recently seemed to gain a lot more than a Jet plate I made from the same neg), it would seem to me hard to hold fine line screens on material that gains 5% in platemaking.  5% seems like the &quot;Mac Truck&quot; that G. Giampa was talking about! At 200 lpi I can't imagine these plates holding a reverse dot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if this indeed happens, I wonder if offset plates have the same sort of gain during platemaking. I've never read anything about this phenomenon before, but since it's also a film-based platemaking process I have to wonder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I have to admit I'm a skeptic that the platemaking is the root of letterpress's gain. Pulling a plate with minimal ink on a coated piece of paper shows minimal gain. Placing the neg overtop this proof shows very little difference between the neg and the plate. Print that same plate with enough ink to transfer well to an uncoated book paper, and a lot of gain occurs&ndash;enough to be visible, anyway. While gain might occur during platemaking, I still think that more occurs from the printing process.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another reason that thin typefaces might appear more substantial when printed by letterpress from photopolymer is the thicker ink film that transfers to the paper on press. I believe I've read that the ink film is four times as thick as the ink film transfered during offset printing. This extra density gives weight and, when properly printed, a sparkle to the type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Okay, sorry to be talkin' shop here. This has been an interesting read so far and I hope I'm not deadening it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harold</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Excuse my tantrum of yesterday. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problems of added weight or gain in letterpress printing (polymer or metal) is one that baffles many newcomers to the craft. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A conservative lay of ink, but not so much so that the type looks greyed, or you see the paper coming through is the only answer. It takes quite a bit of practice to get it right so that the type is defined and crisp. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My approach, after screwing up a lot in the beginning, is to start piece with almost no ink. Next a pleasing amount of impression, without the extreme crushing of the paper so popular with some. Once the impression is set, I creep up on the ink, adding the barest amount until impression and ink lay suit me. It is absolutely necessary to print onto  hard packing and not into a soft base. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Under-impressed, overinked type was what was aimed for in the trade in the fifties, in  a bid to &quot;immitate&quot; litho and its planographic look. This was even funnier than over-impression. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type foundries producing really works of art catalogues, notably the German ones would attain superb reproduction by running the different point sizes as separate pressruns, even if they were all black,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->since 36 point is best addressed separately from 6 and 8 point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About the transition from metal to digital. Do you not think that the diiference is the that fact that three dimensional printing will always look different than planographic? Perhaps one of the things that also affect the attempt to re-create something like Centaur or Bembo or Garamond is that once it is in the hands of the person processing it on a computer, there is nothing to stop that person from messing with the tracking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Add that to general form and construction of each letter and the nearly intangible problem of correct weight, and it is  easy to accept that Monotype digital Pastonchi will not be a dead match for its metal predecessor. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think planographic and three dimensional printing will always look different, certainly. Both can look good or bad; most printing under both technologies is merely average (neither lovely nor ghastly); the aim should not be for either to mimic the other, but for each to be good of its kind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems a fair criticism of some of the early digitizations that they were done poorly, especially as regards weight. Some of the mistakes can be excused, as the inevitable birth pangs of a new technology. Some was just sloppiness &ndash; and often as much on the part of users as on the part of the foundries. Use, say, Centaur without using oldstyle figures and ff ligatures, or with faked small capitals, when all are available, and you get what you deserve. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I do think letterpress is misunderstood, and to some extent, if I may use the word, idolised. It, too, had its limitations. There are some things that digital type can (or could) do easily (kerning; justification which is best for the paragraph as a whole, not just the line; hanging punctuation) which were hard to do with movable type. And, I willingly grant, other freedoms that are less welcome (such as messing with tracking, slanting, the creation of fake sorts and so on). Unfortunately, the good points have perhaps been too little developed, and the bad points remain. But hopefully that is a matter of time. It does not seem inherent in the technology. It is unfortunate that some technology has not only made it possible to do silly things, like adjusting tracking, but positively encouraged them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do not believe that we can realistically demand that a digital version of a metal type should be a dead match for its parent. It need not, and perhaps should not be. We can reasonably demand that it should be (a) good as type and (b) &quot;true&quot; in some intangible sense to its origin. Of composition and printing, we cannot (and should not) try to mimic letterpress, but we can aim to produce work that is good of its kind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There may well be something in Hrant's notion of the &quot;softness&quot; of letterpress in promoting readability. For my part I find that the very slight reduction in contrast between thick and thin also matters. Digital type/offset printing tends, as I see it, to accentuate contrast whereas the slight thickening of letterpress tended to reduce it. I find that too much contrast makes for a glittery, jittery, jumpy read.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would agree with this except for the conclusion. The democratization of type can be seen as a good or a bad thing. But the growing romanticization (word?) of metal type and the printed matter thereof, is because of its real world presence (whether or not it was indeed what it is now being claimed to be), thus it gathers an aura as we move further and further into a virtual reality. Digital type, literally, is virtual, non-physical. As we move further and further and deeper and deeper into the virtual, I would suggest our only link with &quot;humanity&quot; will the physical connections to the past. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's start over, relegate the print era and its typography to the important, yet minor role of cultural legacy, and build a digital typography that can express individual humanity far better than print typography did&hellip;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm struck recently by how beholden to the metal type paradigm digital typography still is. Despite the absence of any physical 'body', we are still essentially treating type as sequences of rectangles, rather than as sequences of letterforms. This paradigm is particularly obvious in our discussions about spacing: we talk about sidebearings and kerning as if this were the normal way to space letterforms, when any scribe or stonecutter would look at you funny if you suggested that he imagine a rectangle behind every letter and shift these rectangles and overlap or space them out. We talk solemnly about how the design of white space between and within letters is as important as the design of the letters themselves, but we continue to work with a paradigm that massively limits the ability to actually design the space between letters without the perverse explosion of thousands of kern pair adjustments to overcome the limitation of the rectangle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few years ago, on the comp.fonts newsgroup I believe, Laurence Penney described a possible spacing model for digital type that involved designing the invisible, non-rectangular envelope that every letter should occupy regardless of its neighbours. Sequences of letters would be spaced by butting the envelopes of the letters against one another. Intrigued by this notion, I made some tests, first with unitised strips of spacing material because it was easiest, and then trying to actually design the ideal envelopes for each letter. It is difficult, but probably only because one isn't used to thinking in this way, but it works and is by far the best spacing model I've seen (and that includes the legendary Kindersley Optical Character Spacing system). However, I think the likelihood of the software industry en masse dumping the existing paradigm of digital type is very unlikely. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I tend to agree with Gerald that our humanity needs a physical connection to the past, I think we should also be aware that the manufacturing of metal type also compromised that humanity because of the nature of the material: we're not made of metal, and much as I love good letterpress printing and admire the craftsmanship that it represents, I'm not sure it represents a sufficiently deep past in which to locate our humanity. My work on Arabic and, to a lesser extent, Hebrew has made me much more senstitive to pre-typographic ideas of spacing and layout, and I think there is a particular humanity in the freedom of arrangement that precedes the rectangle of the 'body'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, you missed my point and are responding to the afterthought. I am saying that there is no logical reason why digital typographic technology should be based on a metal type paradigm (whether handset or mechanical); the fact that today's digital font technology is based on such a paradigm is due to historical exigence: it is easier to model an existing technology than to invent new ways of doing things in a new technology, especially when existing companies have a massive collection of design and metrics data that they want to leverage. But when the paradigm of the existing technology is based on the properties of a particular material &ndash; in this case, metal &ndash; does it really make sense to carry that paradigm over to a new technology from which that material is absent? Historical exigence is important in understanding why things are the way they are, but it should not be accepted as the way things must be, let alone as the best way things can be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why does digital type have sidebearings? Why is spacing based on a combination of glyph metrics and kerning? What other paradigms can we find in earlier technologies (including handwriting)? What new paradigms can we create that take into account the specific material (bits and bytes) of digital typography? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FontLab's half-implemented anchor based kerning is a step in the right direction, it seems to me, but the bigger step would be to abolish the whole notion of kerning, which is nothing more than the exceptions to the rule of the rectangle, and have anchor or envelope based spacing per se.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Look at it this way: at the moment we already have this idea that sidebearings should relate to the letterform; that is why the sidebearing on bowls is less than that on straight stems. But the sidebearings still define the sides of a notional rectangle, because that was the shape made by the old metal type mould and on which font metrics have been based ever since. It is a shape that works reasonably well for the Latin script, and if you are working with metal and don't have an easy means of changing the shape of the mould relative to individual letterforms a rectangle is not a bad choice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All I'm suggesting is that the 'digital mould' should be more easily adjusted to correspond more closely to the shape of the letterforms, to correspond better, for example, to diagonal forms and to overhanging forms. This is what I mean by 'envelope', a kind of bubble that defines the space on which a letter sits (and note that the letterform may, in some cases, extend beyond the bubble, e.g. at the extremes of the serifs on v). It serves the same function as the rectangular 'face', but is tailored to the letterforms. So rather than butting two rectangles up against each other and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then<!-- raw HTML omitted --> making a secondary adjustment (kerning) to improve the spacing of particular pairs, one would butt the spacing envelopes against each other and, because they correspond more truly to the letterforms, no secondary adjustment would be necessary. Does that make sense?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure what you mean by 'over extensions of the rectangle'. Do you mean simply parts of the letter extending beyond the edges of the notional rectangle of vertical em height and horizontal advance width? This is possible in any digital outline font format (it is problematic for bitmaps). Indeed, the fact that the outline is no actually bound by the rectangle, that the rectangle is invisible and non constraining, is one of the reasons I think the rectangle is an anachronism: a virtual hold-over from a previous technology. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, having said this, I should add that actually trying to design spacing envelopes that correspond to letter shapes is much harder than making rectangles. One solution is that spacing could be done simply by adjusting the position of letters relative to each other in an algorithmic series of contexts, and let the computer calculate the appropriate shape of the envelope to achieve the desired spacing. The number of steps you would need to go through for each letter would depend on the shape. Diagonals and overhangs would be the most complicated, but they are already and require the most kerning.</div>

For that matter never did. I view the product on the paper. When grids irritated I worked to escape them and found it possible even with single unit quad units. See: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://lanstontype.com/">http://lanstontype.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or this:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Granjon.html">http://lanstontype.com/Granjon.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> this example has evidence of grid only on the outer corners. Those would be elimated in a further step and repeat performance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linotype is not a rectangle but a long slug, or for those not familiar with the term, a bar of metal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But as far as grids go, or retangles as you put them, they never to be limitations for hot metal types, at least not often, when they were, such as &quot;script types&quot;, particularly the extremes from German and Dutch foundries you can view some very peculiar looking type bodies. Other faces, not even scripts, but Caslon Oldstyle Italic Swash was cast in a most unusual fashion. But wait, think about the obvious, why should we search for such extreme examples? Lower case italic y, j, overhanging f's, ligatures. Solutions, not limitiations. That's what I see, not rectangles and prisons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, no matter how you look at it, the objectives are the same even when the solutions are not</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Transitions from script to digital: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cursive writing is rather like reading, in that one is concentrated on one letter, and vaguely aware of what's coming. One adjusts the shape of the letter one is engaged upon to get ready for the next, and make the appropriate ligature. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The act of writing can be considered as one long motion of the pen, leaving the surface (z axis) for spaces and registering a trace on the x, y plane. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A stroked path is closer to this than an inside and outside path for each glyph. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I was working on Handsome, (a cursive script that was constructed on a stroked path), the main thing was that every letter had a start and a finish. the trick was to align the end of one letter with the beginning of the next. It was a very different process than the usual type design of discrete chunks, and yet one that seems very simple and &quot;true to materials&quot; for vector-based description. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps fonts will cease to exist. Each text will be a path composed of many character paths (very basic glyph shapes), and the typographer will have a series of sliders (like those of LetteRRor's &quot;Twin City&quot; typeface) that adjust parameters such as contrast, angle of stress, kind of serif, etc. The basic &quot;types&quot; will be pre-set combinations, and on-the-fly algorithms such as &quot;optical spacing&quot; will finesse the appearance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">'Fine typography' can look after itself: it always has; that's what makes it fine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm interested in the ability of people to communicate in fully articulated text. I don't consider smallcaps, oldstyle figures, etc, a set of tools to make type look nice. I consider them part of a conventional system &ndash; developed over several hundred years of typography both fine and not, printing both good and bad &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for the articulation of text.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you really think the typographic universe is divided between fine typographers (all half dozen of them) and secretaries? This is a fantasy. Huge amounts of type is set by graphic designers who have had, if we're lucky, enough typographic training to distinguish Bembo from Baskerville and may know what a ligature is. Most of the people I make fonts for are neither secretaries nor graphic designers; they are publishers and scholars. Do you really think these people are going to sit down and manually space a document, even presuming they knew how? Does that mean, as you suggest, that their books and journals should be printed without ligatures, smallcaps, etc., i.e. that they should be denied the opportunity to fully articulate their texts? Why even bother to give them italics? Perhaps every book except those few typeset by a Giampa-Approved Fine Typographer</div>

As much as I'd like to agree with the rationale of your argument I do believe that Gerald has a very strong point here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's take Lanston as an example. Gerald didn't have to provide the typographic extras he gave us when he began digitizing the Lanston library. While I was swayed over to digital by Adobe's efforts (Expert fonts), it was the considered work of folks like Giampa (if I may) that were to show the way. This was when Emigre reigned supreme for god's sake and David Carson had just discovered that his own drops of blood on a page could be considered typography. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Had not professional typographers got involved with digital type, and forced the way&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Lange</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although the &quot;envelope&quot; approach might be a slightly better way to space type than sidebearings, I think even the envelope requires kerning overrides. Maybe it would require fewer of them, and would reduce the number of kern pairs in most fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But in my own tests of this, there were plenty of relatively common situations where it doesn't work all that well. What we really want to do is make optically even spacing by roughly equalizing the total amount of space between letters. If you stick an envelope on a shape like &quot;O&quot; and you stick two O's together, they end up a little too far apart (at least in my experiments). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But even if the envelope approach were better than I think it is, John is also exactly right that there's huge inertia of the existing type libraries, apps and OSes that make it so this will never happen. I don't think that the advantages over the status quo are sufficient to convince the relevant people to do the huge amounts of work to change those pieces. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald: Monotype and Linotype had metrics information for SPACING, that was carried over to some degree in the digital era. I think it's actually most noticeable to me in the Monotype fonts, where certain advance widths keep on popping up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and please ignore Hrant's lies.
