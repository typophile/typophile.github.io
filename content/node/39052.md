  body: "Young people = tiny sizes ok.\r\nOld people = Large sizes necessary. \r\n\r\nIf
    it's readable, it's readable by everyone, just adjust size for age. Bembo, Garamond,
    Gill Sans, Dolly, Really, Corundum, Miller, etc. are good for text.  Curlz, Matura,
    Bickham Script, Exocet, Ed Interlock, and Broadway are not. "
