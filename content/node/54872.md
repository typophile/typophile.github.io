  body: "In spite of the fact that the two P's look almost identical, I think this
    may be hand-drawn lettering. Notice that the counters in the O's are not identical.
    If you don't need to make an identical match, it should be easy enough to find
    a hand-drawn sans serif font that could be used to reproduce this look.\r\n\r\n\r\n-

  body: Thank you for the help. I thought maybe the outline and drop shadow were hand
    drawn, or added to an existing typeface. I'm working with someone who really wants
    to reproduce this as closely as possible but needs more letters than these, and
    asked me to help reproduce this. I'll see what I can do with an existing typeface...

    of fonts that might be a suitable base to work on, although neither are as bold
    as your sample:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/sign-artist/|Sign

    drawing than to hunt down that one specific font.

  body: Hrm, yes, but this person wants a full set of letters to work with... the
    more at this I think it is an actual typeface though, but maybe the drop shadow
    was added manually, or the discrepancy between the two "O"s is just a result of
    bad printing.
