  but can't seem to find an exact match. I'm not convinced that somebody spent the
  time to customize one, so I'm assuming I can find a pretty close match. Looked through
  dafont's western fonts and 1001fonts also, nothing that was right. Any Ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pawshop1_5987.jpg]"

  body: Yup Mike F! That was it, turns out the raised print had bled out a little
    abstracting the font. Got it revectorized, thanks a bunch!
