body: first, sorry if this thread is a retread...I searched the forum first but didn&#39;t
  find anything similar. I&#39;m looking for suggestions for a straightforward org.
  scheme for their fonts.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I&#39;ve been asked to standardize
  the organization for every computer in our dept. Sorting by foundry led to a user
  revolt, and sorting by alpha &#40;while the best option so far&#41; means I have
  to pick through the Adobe Font Folio and throw out the duplicates that Suitcase
  flags.  <BR> <BR>Finally, we also have a folder of &#34;fonts that we have somehow
  but are of doubtful legitimacy &#40;or we can&#39;t remember&#41; and which we pay
  for when we use them if not sooner.&#34; Unfortunately most of these are of the
  Castle/SoftSeek/SSi variety of which some are Type 3s, but that we keep around in
  case someone should send us a file that has experienced a &#34;250,000 Font Explosion&#34;
  if you catch my drift. <BR> <BR>thanks for your help, <BR>Enrico

    -- the best resource IMHO -- is not the easiest way to do this&#41;:  <BR>First,
    in Libraries according to origin &#40;eg Adobe, AgfaType, MonoType, etc. etc.&#41;
    -- I do this when importing them.  <BR>Second, in Sets -- Display, Serif, Sans,
    Slab-serif, Script, Pi, in the way FontShop&#39;s FontBook does &#40;you do need
    a reference!&#41; -- and also in Sets for each Client or Project. <BR>It took
    me a couple of weeks to get everything in shape, but then I had a fifteen year

  body: 'I just cleaned up my personal &#40;vastly simpler&#41; type collection recently,
    so maybe my own process will be helpful. <BR> <BR>My goal was to end up with a
    system on which I could trace the origin of every font installed, with the aim
    of having all of my type legal, and know where to find all of the licenses and
    EULAs for my type. My first step was to blow away my existing FontAgent Pro and
    FontReserve archives &#40;yes, I own licenses to both programs, having licensed
    FontAgent Pro when I finally ran out of patience for dealing with Font Reserve&#39;s
    many bugs and its glacial release schedule&#41;: they were both at around 17,000
    fonts that I&#39;d acquired from various sources over the years. Not only did
    I have many, many unlicensed fonts, both FontAgent Pro and Font Reserve ran incredibly
    slowly and were more or less unusable and unnavigable. So boom, deleted that and
    my machine was instantly a lot more responsive &#40;FontAgent Activator was a
    huge pig&#41;. <BR> <BR>Then I created a new set of three folders inside my top-level
    fonts folder: <BR> <BR>1 free / &#34;free&#34; fonts <BR>2 licensed non-free fonts
    <BR>3 unlicensed non-free fonts <BR> <BR>Within those folders, I created a folder
    for each typeface or type family, following a strict naming convention of foundry,
    then family name, then the formats contained within the folder: &#34;Linotype
    Neue Hammer Unziale ot&#34;, &#34;MADtype Brauhaus t1&#34;, etc. <BR> <BR>This
    list gets quite long, but it makes it really easy to find everything, either via
    scanning the list or using &#34;Find...&#34; on the fonts folder. This, in turn,
    will help me keep my FontAgent Pro installation relatively slim, because I only
    import fonts into FontAgent when I need them. I&#39;ve also gotten in the habit
    of creating a separate library &#40;something FontAgent Pro makes easy&#41; for
    job fonts &#40;i.e. fonts provided by customers to be deinstalled at the end of
    a contract&#41;. <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t deny that there are a few warezed fonts
    still floating around my system &#40;see folder 3, above&#41;, but those that
    I do have I keep around for short periods of time, and my strict policy is to
    not use anything in even personal projects unless I have a license for it. &#40;As
    a brief aside, I&#39;m really happy with this policy, as it&#39;s forced me to
    be more deliberate in general about which type I use, and I definitely attach
    more value to individual fonts than I did before. This should be obvious, but
    most of the designers I know come from the &#34;more is always better&#34; school,
    and many, if not most, of the designers I know are still more or less amoral when
    it comes to font piracy.&#41; <BR> <BR>I think you might want to create a fourth
    folder for fonts of unknown or dubious provenance, and gradually sort it over
    into the other three folders over time. I&#39;d also create a fifth folder in
    which to keep sets of fonts that are sent in for specific jobs, and try to keep
    those fonts out of the other four folders, and try to keep them organized into
    sets in your font manager so you can clean them out at the end of a job. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve done service bureau work before, and I know what a nightmare it is
    trying to stay on top of everything that comes in for jobs. I think the key is
    to not try and do everything at once, and to set up structures that make it easy
    to improve organization over time. <BR> <BR>Also, if you can, invest in the workgroup
    version of your font manager. Having one repository of fonts will make your life
    a lot easier in the long run, even though client-server font management brings
    some unavoidable maintenance and troubleshooting with it &#40;in particular, corrupt
    fonts on the server can cause massive headaches for everyone, and font caches
    need to be cleaned out with alarming regularity&#41;. <BR> <BR>As a final note,
    both FontAgent Pro and FontDoctor are OK at verifying fonts, but both of them
    have trouble with false positives &#40;marking fonts as bad or missing PostScript
    / bitmap versions when in fact they work fine in Mac OS X&#41; and false negatives
    &#40;failing to notice that a font is corrupted&#41;. I&#39;d suggest buying and
    using them both. Also, I don&#39;t like how either one automatically organize
    fonts, mostly because they&#39;re dependent on the metainformation stored inside
    the fonts, and foundries are incredibly unreliable about getting this information
    in there completely and correctly.'
