  \r\n\r\nWhen setting text in a document and the sentence ends with a scientific
  inferior number (SINF) / Subscript (SUBS),  or writing a list of items that contain
  SINF characters, is it better to write using general punctuation, or use the punctuation
  provided in SINF/SUBS lookup? \r\n\r\nI have provided a sample sentence in the image
  attached. The sentence at the top used general punctuation for all, whereas the
  lower uses all SINF/SUBS punctuation. Style Manauals do not provide advice on this
  particular topic, hence, my question.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "from another recent hhp post:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Since I don't use fonts

    You set the paren following the f (or l, or d, or whatever) in the font the customer
    requires (i.e., the publisher, whose house style is established by editors). Whining
    that \"hhp told me otherwise\" gets you a repeat P.E., and a lost customer, if
    customers come from those who <cite>use</cite> type. But really, you're only suppose
    to hang type on museum walls, right?\r\n\r\nAnother hhp quote from this thread:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Remember
    that there's no kerning between fonts.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTrue indeed. That's
    why writing a script in the layout program that puts in a kern saves handwork.
    Otherwise, you perform the necessary handwork. For the fun of it, consider the
    other choice, making the following punctuation italic. \r\n\r\nFrom altomuch <cite>&#91;sic&#93;</cite>
    lots...\r\n\r\nNow the italic letter doesn't collide with the bracket (or if it
    does, you can kern it); instead, the following word space tends to disappear,
    depending of course on the font, the wordspace assignments, and justification
    settings used. Even if the space doesn't optically disappear (which gets another
    P.E.), you get the \"use even space\" mark from the proofreader. Editors care
    about results, not excuses. To say \"but really, there <strong>is</strong> a space
    there gets you the 1,000 yard stare.\r\n\r\nThe really good type designers I know,
    while they may not know all that much about using type, always seem to listen
    to those who do. Some even get their work in museums,  MacArthur grants, etc...\r\n\r\nTo
    the Original Poster: for a sentence-ending period following scientific notation
    -- or any superiors/subscripts, for that matter, every style I know requires the
    regular period. You may have to kern it some to keep the meaning clear."

  body: "Type designers, being makers of tools as opposed to makers of end-products
    should listen to all feedback avidly - but all of it does need to be filtered.
    Feedback from other type designers must be filtered for ideology; for example
    if you don't believe in chirography you should ignore a chirographic type designer
    telling you that your stroke weights are \"wrong\" - but that person can still
    give you good advice on other aspects (for example telling you that the join of
    your binocular \"g\" is cramped). Feedback from type <em>users</em> must be filtered
    for a weak grasp of readability; most typographers developed a hermetic microcosm
    of rules -and a limited set of favorite fonts- that help them get the job done,
    \"compartmentalizing\" the complexities of reading.\r\n\r\nEditors who don't understand
    that abutting Italic and Roman can <em>sometimes</em> cause serious trouble will
    never produce the best work. Asking for a rewrite is inefficient and disrespectful

    can't help propping me up as a straw man and flinging that at me. I guess you

    you can't even be bothered to look at the text cut instead of the display cut
    when judging it for text... And you won't even admit you made a mistake. And you
    speak of <em>listening</em> to people? BTW did you end up buying Harriet as you
    said you would? And FYI, I've saved that thread, and this one.\r\n\r\nDon't trust

    bill.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nActually, while a lot of designers do set the text these
    days, they tend to be freelance designers. They do this because setting the type
    gets them more money than the design work, even if they do both the covers and
    the text interior. And of course, they send a bill to the publisher...\r\n\r\nDesigners
    at larger presses often don't set the type. The time they would spend setting
    the text is effectively lost for design work. What with Asian typesetters thrown
    into the mix, it's a real hodge podge.\r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering about alterations:\r\n\r\n
    The fewest you typically see in an academic book is about 100 in first proof.
    Average is about 250, and I've worked on books where there are more than 1,500.
    Cost usually runs from $0.75 to $1.25 each. What we do at our shop is to charge
    hourly if the number of alterations, billed singly, would be higher than our standard
    hourly charge. Not everyone follows this practice, though. \r\n\r\nBack in the
    days when typesetting was always started by keyboarding from copy, I knew of shops
    who would bill for every alteration on a page, even if than wound up being more
    than the page rate for setting from copy. We always limited the amount to what
    it would cost to set the page from scratch.\r\n\r\nMany publishers give the author
    an allowance. Anything over 100 changes, the author pays for. Or, the editor may
    disallow some of the author's alterations if they feel it doesn't significantly
    change the work.\r\n\r\nSorting the alterations charges is usually broken down
    into three or four categories (1) AAs (author's alterations), (2) EAs (editor's
    alterations), (3) DA or BK (designer's alterations), and (4) PEs (printers errors).
    (Note that only they typesetter can make an \"error.\") The publisher pays for
    the first three kinds, the typesetter absorbs the cost of fixing their errors."

    for advertising or small, intricate pieces, but the really good type designers
    I know have an sense of space, and that can be used for striking layouts, at least
    in bookwork (which includes part pages, title pages, even complex chapter openings).\r\n\r\nI
    think designers setting type is more a matter of patience with small details.
    There are a couple Royal Designers for Industy I know who are polar on this. Richard
    Eckersley had infinite patience, and would change the measure on a single page
    if it gave him better line breaks. A change of 3 points with a 22-pica measure
    just won't show, but might give different line breaks, or even make/save a line
    for banishing orphans or widows. It would take Richard several weeks to set a
    book, working late into the night. But he'd do it. \r\n\r\nGeorge Mackie, on the
    other hand, would specify a book by saying \"set it in 10/13 Baskerville, 25 pica
    measure, 39 lines per page.\" The comp was suppose to be good enough to get the
    rest of the details -- extracts, epigraphs, maybe subheads, etc. It wasn't that
    George wouldn't pay attention to the proofs, and you'd better do a good job or
    he'd catch it & bring you up short. But he didn't expect to have to pay attention
    to what was another person's job. \r\n\r\nAnyway, personally, I'm very limited
    in what I can be effective with in in terms of book design. I have to rely almost
    completely on space for dramatic tension & release. But when that fits a particular
    text, people seem to like it. \r\n\r\nI'd think type designers would be superb
    at this kind of text design, and even the setting, if they have the needed patience..."
