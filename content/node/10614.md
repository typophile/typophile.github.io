  body: "Hmm... The (bold) Helveticas I know doesn't have such strongly upward-pointing
    y-tail. The tails of a's are also weird, shouldn't such strong weight of Helvetica
    \"loose its tail\"? \r\n\r\nI wonder if this is a lighter helvetica made heavier
    by stroking, that would explain some of the weirdness going on. Or is this some
    old photolettering version?\r\n\r\n(Ooh...editing a post without the dontlooklikecrap-hassle:))"
