body: "So my computer crashed and had to completely start from scratch. My heart fell
  as soon as I went to reboot my computer and nothing but a setup assistant popped
  up. Soon nothing was working so I did a few reboots of the P RAM and eventually
  got tiger started on a complete reinstall, followed by Leopard and then trying to
  recover my files from \"time machine\". I've lost all of my logo work that i've
  done in the last two weeks which is all for my job that I start in the next week,
  so I'm sad.\r\n\r\nHopefully I'll have Adobe design suite installed soon and designing
  again!\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: What do you attribute the crash to? After I see what they announce at Macworld,
    I will be buying one very soon, and haven't heard of that problem.

    to that extent. I would be interested to hear what caused it.
