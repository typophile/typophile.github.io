body: "Has anyone here seen a demonstration of this release of UTS? If so, do you
  see it as a significant move forward from UTS and UTS2? Despite the fast approaching
  release date there is very little information on the Extensis website.\r\n\r\nIf
  Thomas Phinney sees this, would you be able to give your perspective on the new
  release? I am particularly interested in the font usage reporting and font license
  enforcement features."

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWe pre-announced Universal Type Server 3 this week. Full
    information will be publicly available in the coming weeks about the wide variety
    of new features that will be available in version 3. \r\n\r\nBriefly, the Font
    Usage reporting features will allow you to track activations, deactivations, additions
    and removal of fonts in your collection. Font licensing enforcement features will
    allow you to enforce the font licensing restrictions, either by strictly prohibiting
    more than a certain number of users from accessing a font, or by merely notifying
    the administrator when the font goes out of compliance. \r\n\r\nWe also built
    quite a few new creative tools such as QuickMatch, Font Snapshots and more into
    the Universal Type Client. \r\n\r\nMore info coming soon. Thanks for your interest.\r\n\r\nJim
    Kidwell\r\nExtensis\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thank you, I look forward to seeing more information as it becomes available
    and hopefully a demonstration of the product. Are you able to expand on the QuickMatch
    and Font Snapshots technology at all?

  body: "QuickMatch allows you to find similar fonts in your collection based on what
    is in the preview. So, you could enter whatever text you want, then use QuickMatch
    to find similar fonts based only on the glyphs used in your preview. \r\n\r\nFont
    Snapshots allow you to create a font preview using any text you want that can
    then be dragged off to the desktop as a PNG file.  This is great for creative
    people who need to share what a font looks like without actually sharing the font
    itself. For example, this could be helpful when choosing a new typeface for a
    client's projects, and needing to get that client's approval. Font Snapshots are
    also anti-aliased to a transparent background so they can be easily used in other
    applications, websites, etc."
