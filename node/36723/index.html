<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is a unicase, pseudo-art-deco sans-serif face that I'm working on. It has latin, cyrillic and greek alphabets. What do people think?

<div class=commentbody>Super! I have to say LJUBLJANA never looked so good :-)
Can't tell ou much about the greek or cyrillic, but I can say that the trasitions from straight into curve are generally not smooth enough. See your U. It starts to high, and needs more "shoulder" in the curve. Just dropping the points without moving the handles might work. This is a global problem.
Also global, it looks like you drew this as a single line is Illustrator and added a stroke. That's fine for a starting point, but causes problems: 1. The horizontals should be a little thinner everywhere. 2. tight curves are had to control like the apex of the A. 3. The joins have a tendency to get too dark. This is less of a problem at light weights, and gets worse as you get darker.

<div class=commentbody>The T with the extra crossbar could be mistaken for an F in some contexts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Based on the fact that I live in a country with its capitol named Ljubljana I must say that this looks very nice. It looks like Ljubljana (the city) in the 60's. To make it more nowadays it should be a bit stronger and less hight variable. Probably.
What I don't like is the T because to me it gets confused with an F.
I also don't find e, c and s as part of the same family. Especially s looks like it has more "envy" or even "hatred" in it and I don't think that goes well with other characters and especially not with Ljubljana itself.
Cyrillic is quite ok, but I think you need to work on the Greek typeface a bit more, because characters don't match the style of Roman and Cyrillic.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow, thanks for all the comments.
@randy: I don't quite see what you mean about the U and other curves, but I'll play with the "shoulders" and try to see it. The font began as a single stroke in FontForge, so it should be easy to try a slight width variation. I'm definitely not going darker, though, so no worries there.
@cerulean & @litera: I guess I need to fix the T. :( My next step is to expand this into upper and lower case versions, so that shouldn't be a problem.
@litera: That's about the biggest compliment you could give me on this font -- I began to see it in my head as I walked from the train station to a hostel in Ljubljana, with the city all around me. I began the sketches that night.
Maybe the middle of the S is too diagonal... would it be better if it were flatter? Or would the e, c, and s look more like part of the family if the serif was smaller?
I'll post another sample once I've got something new to show.

<div class=commentbody>The problem with your "s" is that it's not symmetrically open. the bottom is open and welcoming, the top is closed and "to itself". Serif definitely adds a lot to that.
On the other hand if you would make those "serifs" smaller it would distinguish those forms from the rest and eventually you'd have to discard them.
When I was saying that design goes well with Ljubljana I meant the word "Ljubljana" goes well with the city. Other words and letters in them don't fall in the same group. I suggest you start making changes on the letters based on those that are in the word Ljubljana. Because those are looking pretty ok to me.</div>
