    vertically, and maybe a stroke added to beef it up:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/verdana/complete-family-pack\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VerdanaBold_3667.png]"

  body: "As for Verdana and Tahoma, both are Matthew Carter designs. Tahoma's letters
    are narrower and it has tighter letter spacing. There is a still narrower version
    called Nina. \r\nVerdana Pro from Ascender has a Black weight in addition to the
    Bold. Compare: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/VerdanaProBoldInUse_5302.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/VerdanaProBlackInUse_3879.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/verdana-pro/\r\nIf I was attempting to duplicate
    the _CORKTOWN_ sign I would create an intermediate weight of these two fonts.\r\n--------\r\nUPDATE:\r\nHowever,
    IIRC, when white letters are placed on a dark background they appear thinner than
    when dark letters are placed on a dark background. It's worth converting Verdana
    Black to a white on dark version and comparing it to the _CORKTOWN_ sign.\r\nDon"

  body: Verdana is a good call as long as her twin-sister [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/tahoma|Tohama]].
    New to me now, while looking for a link to Tahoma on MyFonts, found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/ft-mammoth|Mammoth]]
    which interesting here, a bit bold though.

    I think you're correct about the image sample being compressed slightly.\r\n\r\ndonshottype:
    Very good advice. I think I will create an intermediate, but will compare with
    different colours first.\r\n\r\nThanks again all."
