body: "When deciding whether to rag or justify text, how many of you take writing
  style into account? I\u2019ve found that ragged text can be great for work without
  a lot of long words, but writing that features longer words can be a real beast
  to rag well, even with the occasional hyphen. Conversely I find that anything with
  a lot of proper nouns is a pain to justify because they cannot (usually) be hyphenated.
  Am I on the right track here?"

    achieving well-spaced, barely hyphenated justified blocks of text, which when
    done well can be things of beauty. '
