  when i activate my font and the name is dotsFDK for example then in illustrator
  in the font list it comes after the L in the list. Someone a idea how that becomes?\r\n(i
  thought some time that my fonts didn't show up at all untill i saw a font that started
  with 'a' at the bootom of my list.\r\n"

  body: Your problem I think is that you are doing a substitute using a standard character
    rather than a ligature. I don't understand the logic behind having do replaced
    by e, but that is definitely not a ligature.

  body: "Nothing is going wrong. The aalt feature can only include one-to-one substitutions,
    not ligature substitutions. makeotfexe is simply letting you know that this particular
    substitution is being stripped from the aalt feature.\r\n\r\nI can't comment on
    the naming issue since you haven't provided enough information. Which name field
    is 'dotsFDK' taken from? What's in the other fields?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "He is merely including the dlig feature as part of aalt. That's pretty normal
    to include all your features in the aalt so that you can get glyph submenus to
    map properly in the glyph palette of AI and other apps. I've never run into an
    issue with that. \r\n\r\nThe warning sounds to me like its finding the dlig feature
    incorrect (which it is) and is catching the error in its first reference which
    would be the aalt feature which is typically at the top of your features list."

  body: "Andr\xE9 is right in this case.. The aalt feature can use only single and
    multiple substitution rules. That particular message means that the logic which
    is building the aalt rules can't find any appropriate rules from the dlig feature.
    Unfortunately, the logic can't tell if the feature was never defined, or was defined,
    but didn't have any rules that could be used for the aalt feature. \r\n"
