A post-modernist approach might be to argue that the world is (as hhp says) too fuzzy to fit into the modernist perspective. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the problems with post-modernism is its natural position hiding behind the coat-tails of the king's new clothes.  I'm sure it would be possible to say worthwhile things from a post-modern perspective, but too often its a cover for lazy thinking, which is immune to criticism because any complaints are obviously from a rationalist, modernist angle, which is just incapable of understanding the post-modern view. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

That's why it didn't really catch on - it refused to grow up, through critical introspection and objective analysis. A new movement can start chaotically, but can only sustain itself through discipline. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The good news is that there's a new Emigre now, and looking at some recent font releases, maybe, just maybe they're on the golden PoMo track now (although all I for one really see so far is faint signals). If that's the case, it sure would be nice for them to admit -and analyze- their confused past. What's scary of course is that intelligent PoMo wouldn't sell very well at the moment. Well, intelligent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anything<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, really&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; humanity is key <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing I would elaborate on that though is this: humanity isn't just formal humanism. The heart of any merit PoMo has (or could have) is the acceptance that humans are only half conscious. A serious, selfless perspective on communication is severely limited by restricting &quot;humanity&quot; to chirography, base animal emotions, or anything else: as much as possible needs to be considered, although necessarily imperfectly. And that's where Modernism implodes: it suffers from the classic Western chimera of Total Control.
