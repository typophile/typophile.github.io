body: "I\u2019m working on a typeface titled New Constructivist. The design was inspired
  by a logo I designed for an exhibit of Malevich\u2019s work, which I built around
  his notion that the square could be the basic building block of non-objective art.
  My goal with New Constructivist is to create an original font using Malevich\u2019s
  ideas rather than creating a revival of old Cyrillic designs. If you want to compare
  my font with existing fonts my letters are most similar to <cite>P22 Constructivist
  Square</cite>, but designed as new Latin letters with no attempt to get a Cyrillic
  feel or to mimic any specific existing design. Eventually I plan to expand this
  to a three weight set; Light, Normal, and Black; depending on what I do with black
  a bold may appear as well.\r\n\r\nv 0.1 - All letters, numbers, and some punctuation
  of the normal weight are drawn. Almost no spacing tweaks or metrics are implemented.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rasterspec_4890.0.1.png]"

  body: I assume the width variations (narrow R,E,U, wide G,N,S) are intended to reflect
    your source, but remember that they will make the typeface less useful in the
    end. I would try to normalize these types of idiosyncrasies where possible. But
    avoid coming too close to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/itc_stenberg/">ITC
    Stenberg</a>.

  body: Width is something I have been dealing with a lot on this one. I started trying
    to build all of the letters within a square, but ended up with the old Pac-Man
    arcade lettering. At that point I started over by building on a grid of squares
    and narrowing some of the letters that I did not feel needed to be especially
    wide. These letters are recreations of another update that I did by hand; now
    I am finding that what made sense in pencil does not work so well in Postscript.

    but that is not really too much a problem, as long as you give it your own spin.
    So, maybe you can get some ideas or inspiration by seeing how others made constructivist-inspired
    typefaces. :)"

    do agree with other comments that the E,H,R, and U are too narrow, and the G,N,0

    after that I\u2019ll knock out a round of aesthetic changes and post a new specimen.
    At least I\u2019m getting comfortable in Typetool now, hopefully soon I can move
    most of the design work into Typetool and save myself all of the cutting and pasting."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beta2_6296.png]\r\nThe latest version
    has been added as a PDF to the original post.\r\n\r\nI have made the widths wider
    overall, and everything is much more consistent in terms of size. At this point
    I am starting to integrate tapers into the letterforms to give the whole thing
    a personality that\u2019s a little more contemporary, although that may get ditched
    if things start getting too humanist.\r\n\r\nI am also thinking about creating
    a slightly rounded set in the vein of old woodblock letters that were designed
    to be worn down without losing their basic look. Any suggestions would be appreciated."

  body: "VERY nice improvements.\r\n\r\n\"X\" and \"Y\" don't look like they'd be
    of the same style. \"X\" also has weight problems. It looks too thin to me. Similar
    style problems are with \"M\" and \"N\" but maybe any change make them less readable.
    I only want you to reconsider the shapes of these.\r\n\r\nDefinitely change \"K\"
    because right now you have a vertically mirrored letter and it looks very strange
    and unstable. Try designing it with horizontal bar in the middle (see Eurostile's
    \"K\" for reference). This will make it look more of the same style. And leg will
    have to go a bit more to the right to stabilize the letter.\r\n\r\nI like very
    much what you did to \"D\" and \"W\". Did you also try to change the \"M\" a bit.\r\n\r\nI
    know you're trying to distinguish between \"O\" and \"0\" (zero), but maybe the
    difference is too huge, because zero looks much narrower compared to other numbers.\r\n\r\nTry
    to change \"C\" and \"G\" to be similar to \"D\" (slanted lines)\r\n\r\nTapers
    work very nice. Keep on. It's going on very nice."

    what I get for not double-checking the tarballs! Fortunately I was able to get
    just about everything back by extracting the embedded font from the PDF specimens
    I had floating around, and I\u2019ve been making a lot of little tweaks this week
    to the letters and numbers, I plan to rework the punctuation next. \r\n\r\nRight
    now I\u2019m still having a lot of trouble with X, Y, D and G. I am also removing
    about removing all of the tapers, as I feel that they clas with the constructivist

    from other Constructivist-based designs...\r\n\r\nI am echoing what someone else
    said before, but what if you give <strong>K</strong> and <strong>X</strong> a
    crossbar? Maybe the <strong>Y</strong> should follow that lead as well.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not crazy about your current <strong>W</strong>... Maybe the sides should lean
    outward some more... but what I especially don't like is the thin stroke in the
    middle -- too different from everything else, in my opinion..."

    or two wider to make the interiors work a little better. I\u2019ve got a lot of
    letters to draw this weekend, so I\u2019ll work those in. \r\n\r\nAnd as for the
    tapers, I think the best way to settle this will be to work them into the whole
    font and see how it works. "

  body: "Hey, James.\r\n\r\n<em>What do you mean by a crossbar?</em>\r\n\r\nThe horizontal
    line in the letter H, for example. So I'm suggesting that you work in a horizontal
    line into those other letters, K, X and Y -- to give them a boxier look, I suppose.
    Of course, that may make them hard to tell from other letters, so you have to
    tread carefully. But maybe the tapering will keep that from happening.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I'm sorry to hear about your laptop. :-(\r\n\r\n<em>I\u2019m tempted to redraw

    departing from the grid can be good.  :-)"
