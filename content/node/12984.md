  working fine except just this one thing.\r\n\r\nIndesign crashes when I try to insert
  a glyph from the Glyphs palette. Actually there are only problems when I try to
  insert certain ligatures. These ligatures are fi fl ffi ffl and st. There are no
  problems with other characters or other ligatures(sp ct ch).\r\n\r\nIt is really
  irritating because I have absolutely no idea why this is happening. :(\r\n\r\nHope
  somebody can help.\r\n\r\nMagnus"
