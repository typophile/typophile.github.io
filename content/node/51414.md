    this might have been based on a typeface. '

  body: "\"might have been based on a typeface.\"\r\n\r\nIt probably is the reverse
    Chris. You know us lettering artists, we use a style for quite a while and then
    convert it to digital so we can enjoy the royalties and move onto something else.
    It keeps us fresh and honest.\r\n\r\nAll the best and have a great weekend.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    purchase. Thanks again.

  body: I would be very surprised if this is isn't hand made lettering. Actually the
    logo works with three different typefaces.
