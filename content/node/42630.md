  body: By "can be used" do you mean <em>comes pre-installed</em> on both OS X and
    Windows?

  body: That would be the best senario, but if it's a purchased font, it's ok too.

  body: "Gill can be used on both systems, but other, and in my humble opinion better
    alternatives would be <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/products/underground.html\">P22
    Underground Pro</a> or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/johnston/\">ITC
    Johnston</a>.\r\n\r\nI guess the closest, commonly installed, face would be Century
    Gothic?"

    <a href="http://typographica.org/001084.php">Gill Sans alternatives</a>.
