  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Im having a hard time coming to grips with type that reeks of NW.  Think Pine,Mountains,Rivers maybe something with a little city in it too. <BR> <BR>Im doing an Internship for Portland Timbers which is the local soccer team and they are letting me come up with concepts for a new ad campaign.  Right now I am fooling around with some mock ups &#40;which Ill save you from seeing&#41; and the idea is to preach more to the chior.  Rather than the soccer moms. <BR> <BR>Anyway my concepts I used Myriad and they defeintly need something else. <BR> <BR>Anyway I am here asking for maybe some typefaces or more examples that could work. <BR> <BR>Here are some good examples I think of NW type. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.rustycans.com/Jubilee-bunyan.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.rustycans.com/Jubilee-bunyan.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>This is a good typeface but I dont feel that it would make for good body text.  The dotted line going thru the R seems very dutch to me.  Reminds me of some of the crazy type at the Oregon State Fair.  Maybe I should Make a stencil version of that to incoperate the new. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.ngaus.org/images/john%20deere%20logo.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.ngaus.org/images/john%20deere%20logo.jpg</a> <BR>I think there could be possiblities with this.. but the type really doenst work well w/o the imagery. <BR> <BR>Well anything that hints lumberjacks would be great.. <BR> <BR>and since I dont post here much, Hi.  ;D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Casey - <BR> <BR>I think some of the tourism related organizations have done a good job of using fonts that convey a sense of the Pacific Northwest mystique: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.traveloregon.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.traveloregon.com/index.cfm</a> <BR> <BR>The Oregon tourism ads have been successful nationwide in promoting the state&#39;s image.  They are posted here in PDF form: <BR> <BR><a href="http://otc.traveloregon.com/adcampaigns.cfm" target="_blank">http://otc.traveloregon.com/adcampaigns.cfm</a> <BR> <BR>In the past, when establishing the image for the Governor Hotel, I have used elements of  writing from the actual journals of Lewis and Clark, typefaces from old event poster images found in the archives of the Oregon Historical Society and images from the 1905 Lewis &amp; Clark Exposition.  <BR> <BR>The fonts used by the Doug Fir Lounge &#40; <a href="http://dougfirlounge.com/" target="_blank">http://dougfirlounge.com/</a> &#41; also convey a Northwest lumber feel. <BR> <BR>Some of the House Industries &#40; <a href="http://www.houseindustries.com/" target="_blank">http://www.houseindustries.com/</a> &#41; might work for you as well. <BR> <BR>- Jeff <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  :: <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity <BR>Jeff Fisher LogoMotives <BR><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com" target="_blank">http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com</a> <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  :: <BR> <BR>Member - HOW Magazine Editorial Advisory Board :: 2005 HOW Design Conference Advisory Board <BR> <BR>Author - &#34;The Savvy Designer&#39;s Guide to Success: Ideas and tactics for a killer career&#34; - from HOW Design Books. <BR> <BR>Speaker: &#34;Tooting Your Own Horn&#34; :: 2005 HOW Design Conference :: Chicago <BR>  <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One thing you can do to convey a rugged/rustic flavor without being &#42;too&#42; obvious is to contrast a narrow grotesque with heavy slab serif, in all caps. A typical combo is Trade Gothic Condensed with Clarendon &#40;I see a lot of Portland design firms using them together&#41;. It works well with a little bit of 50&#39;s kitsch -- I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what you had in mind when you linked to the Rainier can. If you want retro-looking body copy, take a look at Mark Simonson&#39;s <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/metallophilesp8.html">Metallophile</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Casey, take a look at how the <a href="http://www.dougfirlounge.com/">Doug Fir Lounge</a> solved that problem, and also what McNenamin&#39;s did with the <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=57&amp;category=Location%20Homepage">Kennedy School</a>&#39;s visual ID. If I wanted a specifically Portland feel, I&#39;d pitch my designs towards a historical feel located between the 20s and the 50s</div>
