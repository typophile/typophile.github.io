<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi again. I'm having some trouble with a logo I decided to help a friends band with. <br> <br>Any suggestions as on what to do? The original idea was to have some sort of ligature, but none of the ligatures I tried to make looked good. <br> <br>This is what I have got so far, the "lundstr&ouml;m bygdell" part is temporary, I'm looking for another condensed and good looking typeface (current is trade gothic condensed no 20). <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1366.gif alt=logo> <br> <br>Suggestions welcome, it would be a huge plus if the typeface was available from the font folio 9 disc as my budget for this job is $0.</div>

<div class=commentbody> Doh, I usually don't forget to describe the client when it comes to logo critique. <br> <br>It's a nu-jazz band. meaning they play jazz but incorporate samplers and syntheziers in their music... They are also some sort of conceptual band, so they don't stick completely to the jazz route. <br> <br>I wanted a logo that was relatively neutral for the above reason, but when I think about it, it should be something organic. <br> <br>As for the dentist office comment, yeah, I have had it before... :/ <br> <br>Back to the drawing board I guess. <br> <br>Suggestions for a condensed gothic typeface?

<div class=commentbody>> something organic <br> <br>Cool - my favorite thing. <br> <br>Check out the logo here: <br><a href=http://www.thtfct.com/ target=_top>http://www.thtfct.com/</a> <br> <br>And there was also a logo shown here on Typophile, but I can't find it now - it was a lc "b" with some amorphous border - that was great too. <br> <br>Ligation: too often it's relied on as a gimmick, but here it might actually make sense. If the band were German I'd suggest trying to make an eszet look like an "L" + "B"... Or what about this: try merging the "L" + "B" into something that looks like a musical note, like maybe that clef thing. <br> <br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=musical%2Bsymbols" target=_top>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=musical+symbols</a> <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> Hmmm... Perhaps there's a way you can still use some of the work and momentum you've already built.... <br> <br>It wouldn't be too difficult to turn your current logo into a musical "repeat" bar -- the double bar with two dots next to it (the two dots, of course, would be formed by the counters of the "B"). This way ou could keep the "LB" direction and work in the music concept as well. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm playing with the idea of growing branches, and perhaps flowers (but that's stretching it a bit) on the LB part, to emphazise the jazz in an interesting way, it helps getting away from the corporate look IMHO. Here's a small update (only sketches). <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1375.gif alt=branching> <br> <br>I feel that the first one is the best looking, extensive ornamentation might be interesting but It's quite difficult to get good looking branches <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>Comments? <br> <br>As for the musical note ideas, I thought of it from the beginning, tried a few... but the band didn't want anything obviously related to music, very interesting ideas and links non the less. Thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody> > the band didn't want anything obviously related to music <br> <br>Makes sense. And the botanical angle is cool. But you're right about avoiding too much ornamentation. <br> <br>The left one is the best, but it really looks like an "L" licking an "R". The licking might actually be a plus (and in any case the two forms seem to be interlocking nicely), but of course not the "R" part. BTW, have you tried a leaf, instead of a branch? <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nope, haven't tried a leaf... I'll do that. <br> <br>One request I got from the band was to make the logo less fat... It had the downside that the B began to look as an R instead. I'll try to fix it, but I might end up scrapping the LB "ligature". <br> <br>As for ornamentation, Bj&ouml;rk (or her design bureau) have made some nice ornamented design, but as stated previously, it's difficult to get it looking good. (not to mention print and especially web issues...) <br> <br>As for branching, I've found a flash magazine that had some nice animated flowers with the look I'm going for (http://www.thisisamagazine.com) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1376.gif alt=ornaments> <br> <br>it might be a bit over the top though. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)></div>
