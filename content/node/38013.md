  that?"

  body: 'The ruler on the tool bar, next to the knife, becomes active when you open
    a glyph window.  Also Alt + 4 turns it on. On my PC control + alt + shift changes
    the arrow to the measuring tool while you hold it down. The only problem with
    that is that it will sometimes switch the keyboard to another language, as alt
    + shift changes the keyboard to another language on a PC. As you are on a Mac
    it''s probably a bit different.  '

  body: "I think the question was about the measurement line, not the ruler. The button
    in the metrics panel is the one you should be using. However, I\xB4ve found the
    measurement line to be a very buggy feature, usually disappearing completely in
    the font after a while..."

  body: "<em>usually disappearing completely in the font after a while...</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    must be what happened. Annoying. \r\nI rarely use it. But it does come in handy
    occasionally in italics."

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nThe measurement line sometimes goes far away to the space on
    both platforms.\r\nTo make it visible again use the Python script below. Open
    your font, open the Edit Macro panel, put this small program there and click on
    the Run Macro button.\r\n\r\nfl.font.measurement = 400\r\nfl.UpdateFont()\r\n\r\nThese
    two strings will set the Measurement line for the current font to 400 units.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

  body: For non-Latin scripts, the Measurement line is really handy - I use it quite
    frequently. Last night it suddenly disappeared from the font and I couldn't find
    a way to make it visible again. Thanks to this thread and Johnych for the solution.
