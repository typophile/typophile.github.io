  body: "It's very unlikely for someone to make such minor alterations to Lubalin
    Graph Extra Light and then call it a font.\r\nMy guess is it's either a version
    of Lubalin Graph with alternate characters, or the designer who set the headline
    just played with Lubalin Graph, got rid of some serifs and added some.\r\n\r\nI
    went to soniacheadle.com (the source of this headline) and in the adress/body
    copy they're using Lubalin Graph so even though in the headline/logo the N and
    the H are slightly wider, the A is missing its \"egyptian\" apex serif and the
    E is suffering an extra serif, I doubt that the designer used a different typeface
    that is sooo similar to the one used in body copy to create this headline. I suspect
    they altered Lubalin Graph Extra Light."

  body: "Serifa doesn't have a perfectly circular O.\r\nRegister Serif is not a bad
    guess it doesn't have a serif on the apex, and it has that extra serif on the
    E, but the proportions for the E are not quite the same, the S would've been a
    deciding factor if the source was of higher quality (and by the way it's the first
    time I've heard of Register, very nice family for a very reasonable price on Myfonts)\r\nThe
    capital C now that I looked at it again looks more like Register, however the
    H and the N have been stretched for sure, this is annoying! :D\r\n\r\nBut still
    why would they use Lubalin Graph in the body copy?\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks David
    for pointing out Register, very nice family"

  body: "The C on Silica is a good candidate, but I think the crossbar of the H is
    a little high.\r\n\r\nYou guys should stop throwing all these sexy slabs at me,
    I'm gonna have a heart attack."
