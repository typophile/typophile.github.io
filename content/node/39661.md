    the Carretera Conventional font will be used. \r\nCommercial versions of those

  body: "ok, here is the translation:\r\n\r\n\"The story is a bit complicated and
    confused. The road and highway signage is based on relatively international standards,
    that also involve the fonts to be used. From the beginning of the '60s Italy used
    the font designed (from 1957 to 1967) specifically for street signs in the UK.
    The designers of the sign layouts and the of the font in use are [[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert|Jock
    Kinneir and Margaret Calvert]], and the font is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/familytree.html|Transport]]
    (URW, 1980).\r\nThe laws on Italian signage (quite depressing) are on any complete
    edition of the Italian \"Codice della Strada\" -Manual of road laws and rules,
    that has specimens of all the alphabets to be used. Some engineers from the Public
    Works Department, one of which maybe was called Cecilia, worked on it.\r\nThe
    system designed by Kinneir and implemented in 1963 is an example of stylistic
    durability.\r\nIn an [[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-09-1/contents|article]]
    called \"Roadside traffic sign\" (originally published on the British magazine
    Design No. 178, 1963) Anthony Froshaug proved that there was no reason for an
    improvement of that signage system.\r\nThe Italian license plates are designed
    by the [[http://www.ipzs.it/scheda_prodgraf_ocv_en.jsp|IPZS]], the Istituto Poligrafico.\r\nIn
    Spring 2003 the Triennale in Milano hosted a very interesting show called \"[[http://architettura.supereva.com/sopralluoghi/20030324/|Asfalto]],
    the character of the city\".\r\n\r\n\r\nin my researches though, i found that
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=traffic+type+spain+d |Traffic
    Type Spain D]] (from an unknown designer), as it appears here is a lot closer
    in look to what appears on the Italian highways than Kinneir's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/d-bold/|Transport]],
    (1957-67), even in its [[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/workingdrawings/alphabet/|Heavy]]
    variant.\r\nwhat my opinion is, is that the font that is being used took its shape
    from Kinneir's original design (the similarity with it is out of doubt), but was
    redrawn and applied without consideration of what were the lighting and optical
    problems concerned.\r\n\r\ni will let you guys (that for sure have a lot more
    typographical experience than i do) judge these images, but please let me know
    your opinions!\r\na.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the comparison between:\r\n--\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/big_card_telepass_4468.gif]\r\n1)

    font will be used. For conventional streets,</cite>\r\n\r\nBasically, the autopistas
    and autov\xEDas are what in the US would be called Interstates.  They are the
    roads which are designated with either an A (Autov\xEDa, such as A-6) or AP (Autopista,

    are newer, with easier curves and more straight areas with better on and off ramps)
    and that the Autov\xEDas are free to use, while the AP charge tolls.  Carreteras
    are equivalent to US-highways or state roads, and are designated with an abbreviation
    for the province plus a number (e.g. M-30)\r\n\r\nThe MAIN difference I've seen
    between the two fonts used in Spain is that Autopista (the font) uses a straight
    bar tilde over the N in \xD1, whereas the Carretera Convencial uses the squiggly

  body: "Just to add some more information on some previously mentioned points:\r\n\r\n*
    \ It seems to me fairly obvious that Carretera Convencional, the typeface which
    is officially specified for direction signs on ordinary roads in Spain, is derived
    from Kinneir's Transport typefaces.  However, I have no direct proof that this
    is the case.  As noted, the stroke width is heavier for Carretera Convencional
    than for even Transport Heavy.  Also, the capital letters and lowercase letters
    with ascenders are designed to be in a 4:3 ratio to the lowercase loop height,
    which matches that of Autopista and, for that matter, all of the FHWA alphabet
    series.  This ratio is convenient for design of Spanish traffic signs since it
    allows a 3/4 size to be used for less important destinations and for parts of
    long destination names.  Examples include \"Pola de Siero,\" where \"Pola\" is
    at the <em>altura basica</em> (basic height, often written \"Hb\" in Spanish construction
    documents) while \"de Siero\" is at 3/4 of the basic height, or \"Torrelavega\"
    at 3/4 the basic height on a sign where \"Lugo\" is in the basic height.  (North
    American signing doesn't vary letter sizes to nearly this extent--the main use
    of the 4:3 ratio is in defining interline spacing on guide signs.)\r\n\r\n*  Spain
    carried out a major revision of its standards for traffic signing in 1992.  There
    have been further changes since then, but none related to typefaces (the biggest
    change came in 2001 with the current version of Norma 8.1-IC, which eliminated
    the green background for <em>v\xEDa r\xE1pida</em> signs).  The 1992 reform introduced
    Autopista and Carretera Convencional.  Before that time (if the 1986 official
    catalogue of traffic signing can be trusted, a doubtful proposition since it is
    clearly not 100% pattern-accurate), there was a typographical distinction between
    ordinary and high-standard roads similar to that which exists now, but the typefaces
    were different.  Spain used the old French L1, L2, and (I think) L3 typefaces
    for ordinary roads, and probably straight Series E Modified (not Autopista) for
    high-type roads.\r\n\r\n*  Old French L1, L2, and L3 are not to be confused with
    modern L1-L4.  Modern L1 and L2 are essentially the same typeface, with stroke
    widths varied to accommodate contrast reversal.  The same is true of L3 and L4,
    which are an italic typeface derived from (I think) Roissy or some other similar
    Frutiger-designed type.  On the other hand, old L1 is essentially the same as
    modern L1, but old L2 is a more condensed version of old L1 (i.e., letters are
    thinner), while old L3 is a serif typeface which in France was generally used
    for tourist signing but also appeared on <i>autoroute</i> signs.\r\n\r\n*  It
    has, in the past, been possible to obtain copies of the Portuguese traffic sign
    typefaces which are not oriented toward use with CAD packages.  They are available
    in TrueType format, with filenames 1n_.ttf (JAE - Fonte Tipo 1A Negativa), 2pf.ttf
    (JAE - Fonte Tipo 2A Positiva), 3n_.ttf (JAE - Fonte Tipo 3 Negativa), and 3pf.ttf
    (JAE - Fonte Tipo 3 Positiva).  They used to be included in the old JAE typeface
    installer, which was freely downloadable from the Web from the Estradas de Portugal
    site (in an earlier incarnation) and had the filename ABCTIPO.exe.  Unfortunately
    this distribution no longer seems to be online, though I think it may be recoverable
    through the Web Archive.\r\n\r\n*  Theodore Watson Forbes is commonly associated
    with the FHWA alphabet series, but strictly speaking he was only the co-author
    of a key paper in 1950 which demonstrated the viability of using mixed-case legend
    consisting of Series D all-uppercase and the lowercase letters of what eventually
    became Series E Modified.  This was for overhead signs only at first.  The uppercase
    letters of Series E Modified were developed separately, to allow button reflectors
    to be fitted to the letters on ground-mounted signs (the overhead signs were,
    at that time, illuminated but not retroreflectorized).  The combination of the
    fat uppercase letters and the lowercase letters was a later development.  Initially
    Series D was used with the lowercase letters at a 3:2 height ratio, versus the
    current 4:3 ratio.  I have seen no direct evidence that Forbes designed the lowercase
    letters which were tested in his paper or even chose them from vernacular usage,
    although loose claims to this general effect have been made in the current edition
    of <em>Standard Highway Signs</em> and by the designers and testers of the competing
    Clearview typeface.  The real reason Forbes is venerated as the god of US highway
    signing is that, in the late 1930's/early 1940's, he wrote an important paper
    relating the minimum height of legend to be used on a sign to the intrinsic legibility
    of the typeface used, the amount of legend on the sign, and the speed of traffic
    going past the sign.  American guide signs continue to be designed to Forbes'
    conservative assumption that drivers need to be able to read a sign <em>twice</em>
    in the time that it is visible to them.\r\n\r\n*  Mexican traffic sign typefaces
    give the impression of being at least loosely based on the uppercase-only FHWA
    alphabet series.  They are available in different levels of condensation, like
    the FHWA series, and there is just one series which has an accompanying lowercase
    alphabet, as used to be the case in the US prior to release of the Series 2000
    alphabets.  Some of the letter and digit shapes are very similar, though not precisely
    identical.  The R in Mexican series tends to have a fatter and lower loop than
    the R in similarly condensed FHWA series.  Also, Mexican series count up with
    increasing condensation, instead of down as with the FHWA Series (Mexican series
    0 being visually similar to FHWA Series E/F).  Dimensioned drawings of the letters
    are available in the Mexican <a href = http://dgst.sct.gob.mx/index.php?id=602><em>Manual
    de dispositivos para el control del tr\xE1nsito</em></a>.\r\n\r\n*  Peru uses
    the FHWA alphabet series without change, but follows Mexico in reversing the progression
    of the series identifiers.\r\n\r\n*  As I understand it, only New Zealand uses
    the Transport alphabets, and only in limited contexts--usually signage for parking
    in urban areas.  Pattern-accurate dimensioned drawings for these are available
    in the <em>Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings</em>, and possibly also in the
    Land Transport Safety Authority's recently compiled index of traffic control devices.
    \ I don't think the Transport alphabets are used in any of the Australian states,
    but I do not have complete information for all of them.\r\n\r\n*  The position
    of South Africa with regard to typefaces is rather strange, since the country
    has changed its traffic signing system twice since 1950.  The pre-1970's South
    African system was essentially similar to Britain's pre-Worboys signing system.
    \ Then, from around 1970 to around 1990 (I don't have specific dates), South African
    signing seems to have been similar to that used in modern Australia (FHWA alphabet
    series, but on British-style map-type signs).  This has since been abandoned in
    favor of a new system, now (in theory) rolled out to the other SADC member states,
    which uses the DIN-Schriften and borrows heavily from <em>RWB</em> and <em>RWBA</em>
    but has a multitude of details to meet specific South African situations.\r\n\r\nNow,
    a question:  can it be fairly said that type conformity is generally poor in countries
    like Israel, India, China (including HK), and Greece where multiple languages
    are used with multiple scripts (not just Roman) on signs?"

  body: Thanks, Ralf. I have an email out to transport.ie already, sent just before
    I contacted Rennicks; all appearances indicate that you are correct in saying
    that the font is likely unavailable to the public. I hold out some measure of
    hope nonetheless. :)

    and I realized you mixed a lot of alphabets in there. You have Greek, Russian,

    the British Transport, but with confusing widths and heights) \u2014 also the
    right diagonal arrows look pretty awkward and thick; I took this picture in Cairo
    last week.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/egyptRoadSign_6664.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is a picture taken in the Cairo Metro: not a street sign, but still uses
