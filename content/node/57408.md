body: Does anyone have any advice on which serif typeface I could use as body text
  to compliment Helvetica? The article is all about Helvetica.  All headings etc will
  be in Helvetica. I was thinking of using a serif typeface that was created around
  the time Helvetica was created in the 1950's. Or can anyone suggest some other ideas?
  Thanks for any advice.

    would be an option, but it will depend on your measure really.\r\n"
