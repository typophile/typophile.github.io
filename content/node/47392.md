  a bit), script-like.\r\nLike used in a tapasbar / restaurant to show the menu.\r\n\r\nI've
  looked at a lot of scripts, but no luck yet.\r\n\r\nMaybe some of you can suggest
  something>\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nMarco\r\n\r\n"

    or Brody Neuenschwander to letter it. They are in country and both are excellent
    lettering artists.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    is right: best bet for exactly what you want is a lettering artist."

    good handwriting to write out a line or two of the menu.\r\n\r\nPick the best
    one and have them write out the alphabet.\r\n\r\nCustom font!"

  body: "I just got back from a presentation, and it seems there is budget (thus time!!!)
    to  explore 'making' a custom font. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a good resource
    ( - i'm a graphic designer, not typographer/type designer) to start (books, software)...
    I would really like to do this myself (for fun and experience)...\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the quick reply's... \r\n\r\nAnd now for some chalk and getting my hands dirty!\r\n\r\nMarco"
