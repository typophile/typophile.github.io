  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A question I've never directly posed, waiting for the answer to become apparent over time (still a relative newcomer), is whether there are conventions regarding body text sizing in whole or perhaps half point size increments? In book layouts, I often find myself using the work of others as a template, and the point size of the body sometimes appears to be in half increments or even something odder than quarter point size increments. Do my eyes deceive, and do most designers/typsetters adhere to standardized sizings for body text (10, 11, 12 pt)? At present, I'm tempted to set something in 11.25 Dante MT.</div>

It is true that before the point size system we now use was adopted, other schemes were tried based on different principles.

In 1822, George Bruce proposed a system in which every size of type would be related to the next one smaller by a constant ratio, the sixth root of two:

Pica: 12 points
Small Pica: 10.69 points
Long Primer: 9.52 points
Bourgeois: 8.49 points
Brevier: 7.56 points
Minion: 6.73 points

In 1824, James Fergusson proposed a system in which 14 lines of Nonpareil type was the fundamental unit, and all the other sizes of type were aliquot parts of that unit:

Pica: 12 points
Small Pica: 10 1/2 points
Long Primer: 9 1/3 points
Bourgeois: 8 2/5 points
Brevier: 7 7/11 points
Minion: 7 points

So it is indeed true that other mathematical relationships between the different sizes of type were considered before the simplest system, multiples of a basic unit, was accepted. Of course, that system was the most convenient for allowing a limited number of thicknesses of leading to be used to align different type sizes.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with the others that it doesn't matter. 

The only argument I can think of against it is that odd sizes may make it harder to notice a sizing mistake when you glance at the character palette. If you're setting 10/12, a quick glance at the palette will confirm if you're using the right size, but if you're setting 10.25/11.75, those extra digits may make it easier to overlook a sizing mistake when you're tired or in a hurry.  But I don't think that's anything to really worry about, especially since you'll probably be using style sheets anyway.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I served my time as a comp. in the 1960s, my boss was an old guy aged 63. He knew the old point sizes and would often refer to primer (he pronounced it primma), long primer and minion.

Large woodletter type, above 72 pt was referred to as, for example, 12 line. This would be 144 pt or 12 picas.

Our standard range of point sizes for most faces went 6—8—10—12—14—18—24—30—36—48—60—72. For a few faces we also had intermediate sizes, usually 9 and 11 pt. Mostly, the size range was dictated by the foundry, for founders' type and, of course, the needs of the work in hand.

Odd but somehow I still feel very slightly uncomfortable using a size outside of this range. I think it's because I became so familiar with these sizes that I know exactly what I'm getting so to speak and going outside this feels slightly anarchic. Weird.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The ideal is what looks right. With  x hts and cap hts not uniformly sized to the em, people who size text for newspapers and magazines looking for just the right size almost always end up in tenths of points. That's what I've seen.

Also:
"If delta hints are hints that trigger adjustments at certain sizes, are there ramifications for delta-hinted fonts of using fractional point sizes?"

Delta hints trigger adjustments at certain pixel per em sizes, not at point sizes, so no, fractional point sizes don't ramify, as such a size is rounded to a whole pixel value by the time deltas strike.

And, when you're dealing with screen fonts, unless the per inch resolution of the device is a multiple of 72, almost none of the sizes one sees or selects actually are whole numbers if considered in points. E.g. a 10 point font on a 72 dpi device is 10 pixels. One point is one pixel. But a 96 dpi device has 1.333 points per pixel. So at 10 point, 10 x 1.333 = 13.33. Since this rounds to 13 pixels, what you see is really 9.7 point, or whatever.</div>
