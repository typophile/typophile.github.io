  body: very nice! i especially like the soft transitions. however a crisper version
    might be nice as well. &#40;i find myself wanting to do multiple versions of everything,
    i guess it&#39;s the gemini in me&#41; i&#39;m assuming you based this off another
    font or some lettering? if so what is it? it almost looks like a Goudy face. Any
    caps in the works yet? at any rate, keep up the good work!

  body: 'I like it. A lot. Clearly you&#39;ve put a lot of thought into preserving
    the gothic letterforms in a much more legible font than usual. The hairline in
    the &#39;a&#39; is a thing of beauty in itself. <BR> <BR>A few nitpicks: the upper
    left curve on the &#39;g&#39; doesn&#39;t look perfectly smooth to me - kind of
    Bezier-ish. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the comma-like dot on ij; to my eyes, a
    traditional soft diamond would read more nicely. The wide letterspacing seems
    to work in the setting above, but I can imagine uses where tightening it up a
    little would be better. <BR> <BR>The &#39;rv&#39; looks almost like a ligature.
    Any plans for more ligs? <BR> <BR>Like paul, I&#39;m definitely looking forward
    to seeing an uppercase.'

  body: i like the tighter spacing as well, but i have one request... could you leave
    the old i &amp; j in as alternates? i kinda like the comma-shaped dots. also good
    job on the d! since you changed that one you might also want to go with a more
    traditional z as well or have it an alternate.

    does someone think it&#39;s incoherent to keep the traditional &#39;d&#39; with
    this non-calligraphic, modern form of &#39;z&#39;? <BR> <BR>Cynthia, thanks for
    your comment. I&#39;m working on the &#39;f&#39; and the &#39;f&#39;-ligatures.
    <BR> <BR>Robert, the ascenders in this font measures 200 units and the descenders,
    150 units. I think it&#39;s a good balance. I tried extending the descenders a
    little bit here, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work. I&#39;m finishing the uppercase
    characters, I&#39;ll post them until the weekend.

  body: 'short answer: <BR>to my eyes the traditional d looks out of place without
    modifying a few other characters. <BR> <BR>long answer: <BR>it seems to me that
    most of these forms are fairly romanized including the v, w as well as the z.
    i don&#39;t think you need alternates for all characters for alternates to be
    useful. i think you could keep your original letterforms &#40;as in post 1 except
    swtich out the i &amp; j&#41; and have alternates for d, v, w &amp; z for a more
    authentic textura feel. maybe do a single storey &#34;a&#34; as an alternate as
    well?'

    the inside two spots? <BR> <BR>BTW, about the softness/sharpness, I agree with

  body: 'Hi Eduardo, <BR> <BR>I just stumbled in here and found this beauty. I noticed
    the slight bend in the terminals. Are you planning another Linotype triumph? :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>There are two sticking points I noticed straight away. The r. I understand
    the desire to improve spacing, but the form is suffering for it. Too droopy IMHO.
    Second is the z. In both versions the horizontal strokes seem about 10% too thick.
    In the version with the crossbar, the balance is off. Try shortening the top arm,
    and lengthening the bottom arm. It should sit better. <BR> <BR>In the caps. First
    let me say, I&#39;m not very familliar with the traditional forms. However, it
    seems that your set of caps was drawn by two people. One person did the BCEFGLOQT
    &#40;this person likes the ogee shape&#41;, and another did the HIJKMNPRSUVWY
    &#40;this person likes the thin verticals&#41;. They collaborated on the D, and
    aliens abducted them and drew the A and X :-&#41; That&#39;s my theory! Kidding
    aside, if you were to set the words Birmingham Daily News, the three caps would
    be too far divergent for a cohesive masthead IMHO. <BR> <BR>Of the two ideas,
    I prefer the second, the one with the thin vertical strokes. I notice that it
    is mostly the round characters get the ogee shape &#40;FYI what I&#39;m calling
    an ogee is the s shaped stroke that looks like a dolop of toothpaste&#41;. Consider
    making this stroke more vertical with an added thin, as in the I and J. <BR> <BR>I
    also notice two different kinds of finishing treatments to your strokes in the
    caps. Note the top of the B vs the top of the D. Bottom of F vs Bottom of J. BTW,
    tail of the Q looks a little wobbly on the bottom. <BR> <BR>I like the OE cap
    combination very much. I have a side question about the OE and AE. When in all
    caps and all lower case settings these make perfect sense. With this type of font,
    just about the only reason you&#39;d have an all cap setting is in a tatoo! Should
    these glyphs then be Ae and Oe to lead in a scentence such as: Aesthetics are
    great! or should it be: '

    but on OSX Preview they show up as tiny dots. <BR> <BR>2. left side bearing on
    f &#40;and its ligs&#41; seems a little loose. <BR> <BR>3. Asymmetry in circumflex
    intentional? It doesn&#39;t seem to be mirrored in the caron. <BR> <BR>4. Of the
    less common characters, I found the OE and capital Thorn particularly delightful.
    Capital Eth is functional, but I feel the crossbar and vertical line interfere
    with each other a bit. Most other blackletters seem to solve this by making the
    crossbar heavier, at least as dark as what you&#39;ve got on the Z. <BR> <BR>5.
    Of the caps, NM don&#39;t seem to fit the ornateness of the other glyphs. Consider
    the solution adopted by Amador: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51175.png"

    light. I think going with the same slightly blobby style as the math symbols and
    dashes would be a win. &#40;Kudos on the latter, btw; it&#39;s the kind of detail
    most people wouldn&#39;t care about, but makes the difference between a great
    and an outstanding font&#41;. <BR> <BR>7. i-circumflex and i-umlaut crash into

  body: Thanks for the great comments, guys. <BR> <BR>Randy, I will draw some alternates
    for the &#39;r&#39; and see how it works. I understand that the current one may
    look strange in some cases. About the &#39;z&#39;, I concluded that the thick
    horizontal strokes in it should be thicker than the vertical thick strokes of
    the other letters, because of the long thin stroke &#40;in &#39;z&#39;&#41;. But
    I see that I made it too dark, so I&#39;ll adjust it. <BR>Your comment about the
    caps is exactly the kind of thing that I needed. I have already started working

    :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Raph, yes, the asymmetry of the circumflex is intentional. I
    made it symmetrical at first, then changed it, but forgot to update the caron.
    You have a very good point about the Eth. And regarding the parethesis and brackets,
    I now realize that they&#39;re even lighter than the math symbols. I&#39;ll work
    on that. <BR> <BR>Dan, do you know where can I find a good reference about the
