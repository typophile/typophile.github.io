    people who created Droid Sans) has a similar shape, at least for the numerals:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/moire/"

  body: "Moire  has the right width to height ratio for the numerals but the waistline
    of the numerals is too low. About the only font I know with a fairly close matching
    height for the waistline of the numerals is this one [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScoutW120pctSM_4967.jpg]\r\nThis
    is Cyrus Highsmith's _Scout_ from Font Bureau with width expanded 120% http://www.identifont.com/find?font=scout&q=Go"

    sample for comparison.
