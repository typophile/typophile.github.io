    doesn't add anything in terms of usability, but it does add extra visual noise
    that detracts from the content. I doubt many people care whether the topic is
    \"hot\" or not, especially considering that the thread message count is right
    there, 400px to the right.\r\n\r\nIcons are also way too contrast. I would rather
    have [[http://swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/typophile-1-b.png|something like this]], more
    calm and restrained.\r\n\r\nThe replacement of \"(xx new)\" links with just \"xx\"
    does not seem to be a very good idea either. Even after I managed to realize that
    \"xx\" <em>is</em> a link (which is damn hard to do on an uncalibrated laptop
    monitor), I still had to overcome my arthritis, carpal syndrome and hangover shakes
    to aim at that ultra minuscule <strong>1</strong> that is now all that's left
    from a link."

    doubles every 18 months.)\r\n\r\n>\"Renuisance [sic] Man, if you think about it
    you'll realize that for a volunteer gig the alternative to letting thousands of

    that newly added features are sometimes problematical. My point is why do you
    have to break so many old features to implement new buggy features?\r\n\r\n>\"Reminds
    me of an expression one of my computer science teachers favored:\r\n'My program
    could ran faster if it didn't have to give the right results.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd that
    reminds me when, decades ago, I told a sales person, \"I can get it for $XX less
    elsewhere.\" He responded, \"Well, why don't you buy it elsewhere?\" to which
    I replied, \"They're out of stock.\" The Response? \"I can sell it for half their
    price when I'm out of stock.\" Ouch!\r\n\r\nIf I've been less than kind, I apologize.
