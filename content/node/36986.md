    Light Extended\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/13113/neuehelvetica43lightextended-font.html\r\n\r\nI
    do recommend that if you decide to purchase this font, do so at Fonts.com. Linotype
    is in Germany and you get an international charge from your bank.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=436479\r\n\r\nAlso
    Helvetica comes in many different formats- so choose the one that best fits your
    budget and requirements.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"
