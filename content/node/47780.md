  with the celebration of the 25 year jubilee of the Friday bar at the Physics department
  of my university, and the organisers allow pretty much one to give them arbitrary
  LaTeX code to render the name. In the natural sciences, especially Mathematics and
  Physics, quite a few people are fairly well-versed in the subject of good typography,
  and so I am sure that many people will spend a lot of time designing a name/logo/picture
  for the coffee mug. Being a lover of typography myself, I of course cannot let this
  chance pass, and so I am determined to make something elegant.\r\n\r\nI like simplicity
  and minimalistic designs, and I very much like the typefaces of the Italian renaissance,
  so I have chosen to use the typeface from the 1499 edition of \"Hypnerotomachia
  Poliphili\". Unfortunately I don't own a copy from which to scan the typeface, so
  I had to settle with scanning a print of the title in Edward Tufte's \"Beautiful
  Evidence\".\r\n\r\nThus I have cut and pasted individual letters to write my name.
  I would like to ask you if you have some suggestions to the kerning of the letters
  in the picture below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EH_6703.jpeg]\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nEmil Hedevang"

  body: "My own opinion is that the spacing between letters is far too wide.  It looks
    as though someone was following an overall spacing rule without any consideration
    for weight or the individuality of letters.  I believe it would look far more
    striking, and readable, if the space between letters was, say, the same distance
    as the width of the vertical strokes in your \"E\"s.  I also noticed that the
    base of the first \"E\" is noticeably lower than the \"MIL.\"  It all looks just
    a bit as though you cut out letters and pasted them safely well away from each
    other.  Which, of course, you did.  Great idea, though, and you should follow
    through with it.  Remember too that the end result is going to appear on a curve.
    \ The larger the lettering and the further apart the letters the fewer will be
    seen at any given time.  You don't want people circling your mug to make out your
    name.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMarc"

  body: "jt_the_ninja: I took the letters of my name in the sequence they appear in
    the title. See the picture below. I did, however, skip the V from the QV as it
    appears to me to be too much of a ligature.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hypn-marked-letters_6079.jpg]\r\n\r\nmarcdrogin:
    I see your point. I spaced the letters a bit loose to begin with due to the rule
    of thumb of letterspacing capitals. In the original title the letters are quite
    close. What do you think of the suggestion in the picture below?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EH-2_5931.jpeg]"

  body: "Emil -- I think the revised version is too tight. Extra spacing of capitals
    is a long-standing tradition in setting inscriptions. At the very least, I'd split
    the difference.\r\n\r\nLooking at your second version: The DE are a little too
    close; try to match the visual space between the NG. The EV are too far apart;
    look at the large gap in space there.\r\n\r\nThe thing that's going to drive the
    fitting* for this setting is the space between AN -- diagonal against straight.
    You can get those two only so close together, and you don't want them touching.
    After that, all other spaces -- straight-straight, straight-round, diagonal-diagonal
    -- are going to need to be balanced in relation to that diagonal-straight AN space.
    Not strictly equal; visually balanced.\r\n\r\nThe combination DEVANG creates an
    almost classic spacing exercise, with its combination of diagonals in the center,
    surrounded by straights, and bookended with rounds. Get DEVANG spaced nicely first,
    and EMIL HE will follow easily. \r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n* BTW, \"fitting\"
    or \"spacing\" are the more appropriate terms for what you're doing here. There
    is only one instance where \"kerning\" could technically apply -- the VA combo,
    where there is actual overlap in the \"personal space\" of the letterforms. Of
    course, with everything being digital and virtual nowadays, this is really just
    semantics. \r\n"

  body: "I still think it looks cool, but to reiterate what marcdrogin said, remember
    that it's going on a mug. Maybe you should think about doing it in two lines,
    so the letters can still be large and it won't go all the way around the mug.
    \r\n\r\nHeck, why not go Classical on it: remove the space between first and last
    name, split it into two lines of 6 letters each (or 3 of 4 each!) and make it
    a block :D\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    setting (3 lines each of 4 letter) but I did not think of using it here. I''m
    sure it will work out very well for a coffee mug. Thanks for the reminder!'
