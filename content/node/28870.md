  angels. If possible in every character. The font must be:\r\n\u2022sans\r\n\u2022modern\r\n\u2022not
  to trendy\r\n\u2022not to futuristic\r\n\u2022friendly\r\n\u2022if possible also
  as text font\r\n\r\nA good example for what I am looking for is Sansa (http://www.ourtype.be/)
  but I am looking for an alternative that is more friendly. Also I don't like the
  W in the Sansa. The W is an important character in the design.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  Thanks!"

  body: "Sophie is to elegant\r\nOmnes is a nice and friendly font, but a little to
    round, not masculine enough. \r\n\r\nMaybe the font i am looking for is Sansa
    but, like i said a little bit more friendly and a nicer designed W.\r\n\r\nWhat
    i like about the Sansa is the way it combines sharp and round \r\nangels like
    in the capital E and F.\r\n\r\nSo i am not satisfied yet, but thanks so far. Suggestions
    are still welcome"

    the logo. To me W of Sansa is nicely designed. It works fine in text.\r\nBy the
    way, OurType customises typefaces."

    yourself to \"fonts\" in seeking a solution to your \"corporate logo\". You seem
    to have a good grasp in what you seek visually. The characters in a logo function
    completely different than those in \"fonts\" and have far less restriction.\r\n\r\nStart
    with the characteristics you like, then hire someone to produce the logo. When
    I designed \"word marks\" it was very important what the individual characters
    were and the inter-relationship of the letterforms, not just the \"look\" of the
    \"font\". Open up your possibilities, not limit them to finding and existing font.\r\n\r\nJust
    my humble opinion."
