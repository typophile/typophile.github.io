  For those who have tried it, can you give us your comments. Also, It seems possible
  to installed it on MAC OSX, however after a few inconclusive tests, I failed. Your
  help would be useful to help me to installed it. Thanks!

    low, increase your volume as needed.)\r\n\r\n1) Installing, it's really easy.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/2a140h3u0T05\r\n\r\n2)
    Using it with the default options, also super easy.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0w1o2l1m1G1g\r\n\r\nNext
    step is to read the documentation and explore the options. They are important.\r\nTry
    with a few different options to see what they do, and test results in a PC\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPablo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
