  with the artwork stamped on them in foil. I've gotten permission to recreate the
  artwork for my personal use, but the owner no longer has any art files. So while
  this post is mainly for the top font \"CASBAH CLUB\", I'm also interested in what
  was used for the denominations (if different) and for \"LAS VEGAS\" at the bottom.
  I'll of course create new requests for them if necessary.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks for
  any help you can give me!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMikko\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casbah

    Caravan, Aladdin, genie, magic lamp, Sultan, Shriner etc didn't produce any thing
    even close.\r\nIf you only need the eight letters it's perhaps as easy to make
    them from scratch as to search for an existing font.\r\nBut possibly someone else
    has found something.\r\nDon"

  body: Oh wow, thank you so much! I'll leave this open for a bit more in case anyone
    knows the Casbah Club font, but if not I'll just create the letters as suggested.
    But knowing the other two is a huge help already!

    if you have trouble locating it.\r\n\r\n\"Arabian\" is a good tag search btw,
    some on MyFonts are pretty close."

    Type CasbaH and you get the same lean, at least."

    and Las Vegas.\r\nFor CASBAH CLUB, about all I can suggest at this stage, is that
    if you don't want to make the letters from scratch, you could use some suitable
    Roman letters, such as Bernhard Bold Cond [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BernhardBoldCondAsCasbah_5240.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bernhard/ and tinker with them using the
    swoosh tips from Bazaar.\r\ndon"
