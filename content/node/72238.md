  body: "You may be right, but with a bit of tweaking of the t, l and f you might
    at least get close with Minion Web. (Selection slightly wided in PS and slightly
    squooshed 7% wider).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calico_4578.png]"

    would further enhance the resemblance. I think you ID'd it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mind the spurs of g, s and t - I'm not really sure. Also the position of the
    dot after www. Maybe the original poster did not use the kerning when making the
    graphic. Anna from Tasmania, please speak up if Minion rings a bell :-)
