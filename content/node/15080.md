body: "I've just started my last year in school, and I'm about to embark on my thesis
  project. But I'm feeling a little lost. \r\n\r\nI am definitely interested in doing
  something typographic. Ultimately, I want to design a typeface and use it in a book.
  But I'm open to other things like posters and even a boardgame (I actually love
  designing boardgames).\r\n\r\nI've been looking into topics like attempts to reforming
  the English language through new alphabets (such as the <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ita.htm\">initial
  teaching alphabet</a>, Benjamin Franklin's <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/franklin.htm\">phonetic
  alphabet</a>, etc.). It's interesting that all these reforms either failed or were
  scapped by their inventors.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I still feel like I have no direction.
  The thesis program at school unfortunately doesn't give students a lot of time to
  research before we propose a topic. \r\n\r\nSince I only discovered the wonderful
  world of type a couple of years ago and most of you are pros (a business-major friend
  of mine uses the term \"type psychics\"),  I wanted to start a discussion about
  interesting topics in typography that are worthy of exploration. \r\n\r\nAlso, when
  you were in school, what did you do for your thesis? Was it an enjoyable experience?
  Or did you want to tear out your hair? Perhaps both?"

    of such things <cite>after</cite> you graduate...  :-/\r\n\r\n> all these reforms
    either failed or were scapped by their inventors.\r\n\r\nMostly because of two
    factors:\r\n1) Lack of central authority.\r\n2) Expecting too much conscious learning
    effort.\r\n\r\nBut actually there have been two notable successes in alphabet
    reform: the best one was the invention of Korean Hangul in the 15th century; and
    the other was the Carolingian standardization of the Latin script (a much milder
    case than Hangul though). And it's very encouraging that Hangul -the only major
    \"designed\" script- is arguably the best writing on the planet. Sadly though,
    we don't have a king...\r\n\r\nBTW, you could get a copy (maybe your college library
    can buy it) of Gunnar Swanson's \"Graphic Design and Reading\" if you'd like to
    read my full Alphabet Reform essay.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Another under-explored topic I find highly interesting is the design and
    use of a \"network\" of visually compatible font styles to change \"moods\" in
    running text. I'm talking about taking the one-dimensional Roman/Italic system
    to much higher levels. I've tried to do that in the display realm with my Daam
    Entity*, but the real gold is in text.\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/s_latin.html
    (See the second column.)\r\n\r\nA third is ligatures, and how they can be elevated
    above a mere device for make things pretty/less_ugly.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDana, do
    you read Chinese? Because the topic of Latin-Chinese\r\ntypographic relationships
    has yet to be properly addressed.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "hrant,\r\n\r\nSadly, I no longer have the ability to read Chinese. But
      I did explore the relationship between English typography and Chinese typography
      in a project last year. I only scratched at the surface of that topic, but I
      agree with you that there is more there that is worthy of further exploration.
      \r\n\r\nWhat did you have in mind? In my project, I covered about how the two
      languages vary in their construction of words, the existence of a \"center line\"
      as opposed to a baseline in Chinese (especially for vertical type), etc. Looking
      back at it now, it's almost a \"Stop Stealing Sheep\" for Chinese typography."

  body: "I'd love to read a thesis that comes up with answers to the question 'What
    do type design and typography do to a text?' \r\nProbably that would have to cover
    a whole lot of semiotic and signologic stuff, combined with linguistic thoughts
    about the complex correlation of <em>signifiant</em> and <em>signifie</em>. \r\nThat's
    a hard one, though.\r\n\r\nRegarding alphabet reform: it came to my mind that
    in addition to hrants examples, alphabet systems have been exchanged, e.g. in
    Turkey from arab to an extended latin alphabet, also in parts of Croatia and Bosnia
    from cyrillic to latin and vice versa. Another interesting point would be interrelationship
    between coexisting alphabet systems (in correlation to language) as in the Balkans."

  body: "You say \"no longer\"? If you had the ability when you were really young
    (like less than 8, preferably less than 4) then all it should take to wake it
    up is something on the level of a college Chinese course.\r\n\r\nSince so little
    has been done in the field of Latin-CJK \"symbiosis\" there should be a treasure-trove
    of angles to explore. One obvious project would be the creation of a Latin face
    subordinate to a classic Chinese font style - although the risk of kitsch is huge
    there. Or you could explore the role of notan in both scripts. In fact I have
    an idea concerning notan that I call \"Yang-style\" :-) which I'd however like
    to keep non-public for now...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
