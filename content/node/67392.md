  a custom character. I have not much more to say, although I do hope you enjoy viewing
  it."

    you know <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2ORENVqEA\">La Linea</a></strong>?"

  body: No, I didn't know of La Linea. What exactly do you mean by the light gray
    edges? Do you mean the outlines on the pilcrow? I've thought of making the stripes
    in the background align with the shadow, but it didn't seem to balance right in
    my opinion.
