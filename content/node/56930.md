    text was made with a typewriter that had a two-color ribbon...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.walkerart.org/design/2008/03/23/typewriter-typefaces/\">These
    samples</a> of authentic typewriter faces include Placard-style 10, which looks
    like a close match (you'll need to scroll down a bit to see it). But there are
    not enough matching characters to be 100% sure.\r\n"

    Do you know of anything close that has been digitized? \r\n"

  body: "Hi, Mary. Yes, all of those faces are original typewriter faces. I actually
    found a digital typeface called Placard, but it looked nothing like the typewriter
    face.\r\n\r\nFor a digital substitute, the Light weight of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trade-gothic/\">Trade
    Gothic</a> might work reasonably well. You might have to track it a bit to reproduce
    the monospaced look of a real typewriter face."
