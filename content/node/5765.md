- body: Yeah yeah, it&#39;s in comic sans. <BR>;&#41; <BR>Other than that, I never
    knew you could display an image at 7 dpi and have it still show up correctly.
    I did some tests though and it doesn&#39;t save file size, so I guess it doesn&#39;t
    matter much. Except that a lot of people have told me my web images have to be
    72 dpi. <BR>That&#39;s all the post is about. Nothing fancy! <BR> <BR>-b-

  body: Oh, OK. <BR> <BR>I suspected that, but there are so many web pages in comic
    sans, I thought that it must be the content that was the subject of the post.
    Then Alessandro&#39;s post, with the comic sans reference, really threw me. I
    wans&#39;t sure if the content of the site was being held up for ridicule. <BR>=====
    <BR>Despite innapropriate typeface selection, scantips is a great website. Its
    been around for years, and is the place I point people to when they get a scanner
    for the first time. <BR>As someone who is often surrounded by computers, I&#39;m
    regularly asked by friends, relatives etc to choose/buy/configure/mend a computer
    for them. Whenever this involves a scanner, I point them to scantips.com and save
    myself lots of explaining about resolution vs dpi etc. <BR> <BR>

  body: Comic Sans aside, he&#39;s got a point. He&#39;s absolutely correct about
    dpi on the screen. But I think he should maybe cut back on the coffee or something.

  body: Apologize, Mr. Steve Paxton. <BR>I didn&#39;t read that Scantips page at all.
    <BR>Mine it was just a silly comic post n&#39;I was sober. <BR>Anyway what shown
    was a letter set in Holy Sans <BR>with a scanned &#34;holy logo&#34; from the
    Parish <BR>of the district where I live. <BR>Dave Combs wonders if they&#39;ll
    make &#34;No 72 dpi&#34; <BR>stickers and t-shirts, and often he gets files <BR>from
    customers that are supposed to be &#34;print ready&#34; <BR>and they are 72 dpi,
    RGB. He said it&#39;s a real pain <BR>in the butt. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>AS
