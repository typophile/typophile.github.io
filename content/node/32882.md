  sample I know, at first I thought it may be rounded (similar to VAG rounded perhaps)
  but as I look at it more I'm not entirely sure that it is.\r\n\r\nHere is a link
  to a couple more pics which may or may not be of further help \r\nhttp://www.practise.co.uk/work/2005/otto-spooky.html\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: This is likely derived from <a href="http://typophile.com/node/730">Vogue</a>.
    It has Vogue's Kabel and Futura elements. I don't believe it's rounded, so I think
    looking at VAG is looking in the wrong direction.

  body: If you're talking about the song list on the CD cover, it looks like Futura
    Bold to me, but between the ghosting on my monitor and some unexpected letter
    shapes, I could be mistaken.

  body: Thanks for the replies. I think this may well be a custom font, Vogue is indeed
    pretty close to it (alas through reading the thread it seems there is no digital
    version?), Nobel also shares similar characteristics in that it is based around
    Futura. I'll keep searching about.

  body: "Tom,\r\n\r\nYou should just email me and ask! To save you the trouble, it's
    a filled-weight version of Rudolf Koch's Prisma which I've designed with Alex
    Rich and Rafael Koch. The font is soon to be completed and released with Lineto
    in a new multi-weight upper and lowercase revision named Prismaset.\r\n\r\nStephen
    was on the right track with Kabel: Prisma shares many characteristics with Kabel
    since they were both designed by Rudolf Koch."

    body: "Ah a reply from the man himself! \r\n\r\nI was toying with the idea of
      emailing you directly but I'm never sure on the etiquette in these matters,
      I know some designers can be rather secretive when it comes to this kind of
      thing.\r\n\r\nReally great font anyway, looking forward to its release. Many
      thanks for the info, \r\n\r\nTom"
