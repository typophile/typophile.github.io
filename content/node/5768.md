  me out. <BR> <BR>Aside from culture-specific writing systems &#40;Korean, Thai,
  etc.&#41;, what kind of type features can be demonstrated as being culture specific?
  <BR> <BR>Are there modern typefaces &#40;as opposed to historical Gothic, Carolingina,
  etc.&#41; that one can point out as being distinctly French, German, Dutch, etc?
  <BR> <BR>I was thinking about the subject after seeing some of the work Kontrapunkt
  has done for DSB, designing sans-serif typefaces based on uniquely Danish letterforms.

  body: This is a very interesting question. Typeface nationality/ethnicity is seen
    by some as too subjective to bother with. Gerard Unger recently gave an entertaining
    talk in Thessaloniki showing how &#34;Dutch type design&#34; isn&#39;t such a
    clear-cut thing. Suburban and Collis couldn&#39;t be further apart, even though
    their designers had the same teacher. <BR> <BR>But there <i>is</i> something there.
    And sometimes &#40;although rarely&#41; it&#39;s pretty clear, like when Adam
    Twardoch points out that Polish diacritics should tilt more. Other times is highly
    contentious, like when Ladislas Mandel insists that French fonts must have smaller
    x-heights. I&#39;d say that usually it&#39;s a matter of getting enough people
    to agree, like that Czech fonts have a certain &#34;fauve&#34; aspect... maybe?
    <BR> <BR>What would be killer is if somebody sat down and did a serious paper
    on this, collecting historic and contemporary samples, asking opinions, distilling
    the whole, and giving us a set of sufficiently usable conclusions for each culture,
    while noting how tenable each given &#34;conclusion&#34; really is. <BR> <BR>hhp

    I havn&#39;t seen any grunge/sans serif/display or even x-height &#40;well x-height
    dosen&#39;t even exist I guess&#41; properties. I wouldn&#39;t be able to say
    for sure, but of all the Amharic/Fidel typefaces I&#39;ve seen you can tell that
    they originated from a pen. They usually have a 7 degree angle on all stems.  <BR>  <BR>then
    again, one could suggest the same for any ancient language that hasn&#39;t steped
    up to the information age, and or of which Microsoft &amp; Adobe hasn&#39;t recognized
    yet.

  body: Paul, <BR> <BR>You should look at a copy of D.B. Updike&#39;s <i>Printing
    Types,</i> which shows a country-by-country history of Western typeface design
    from the earliest printing in the 1400s up to the time the book was written &#40;I
    have the two-volume 1937 edition&#41;. Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1584560568/qid=1042073777/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-4063219-9562230?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">current
    edition</a>. You can also find used copies, but this tends to be an expensive
    book &#40;or books&#41;. <BR> <BR>The first edition was written in the 1920s,
    then revised in 1937. I believe it was revised a couple of times later, but to
    me the most valuable information is the early history of printing and type design.
    The book includes numerous reproductions of book pages and type specimen sheets.
    <BR> <BR>William Morris&#39; Kelmscott Press books in the 1890s started a revival
    of interest in historical printing types. However, little was known of the history
    of type design, and one of the only ways to learn about it at the time was to
    look at antique books; little scholarship had been done. This is one of the earliest
    and is still the most exhaustive survey of printing history that I&#39;m aware
    of. Updike can be opinionated and a little cranky at times - for instance, he
    obviously dislikes Baskerville&#39;s type, even though he used a very similar
    typeface for his own book. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure how much you know about the
    history of typography &#40;so forgive me if I&#39;m talking down to you&#41;,
    but you may be surprised at how old some of the typefaces we commonly use today
    are. The various versions of Garamond are based on French typefaces from the 1600s,
    and Baskerville and Caslon, two very popular English typefaces for modern book
    design, date from the 1700s &#40;and were both used by Benjamin Franklin&#41;.
    Centaur and the various versions of Jenson are based on Italian designs from the
    1400s. <BR> <BR>Early Roman typefaces fell into rough groups that could be generally
    classified as Italian, French and Dutch/English, and modern revivals based on
    them still retain many of these characteristics. The best type designers are very
    aware of the characteristics across both time and place, and generally don&#39;t
    mix incompatible features from different traditions or eras. For instance, the
    modern Minion typeface looks very French. <BR> <BR>The early European printers
    used blacketter typefaces &#40;examples are Old English and the German Frakturs&#41;,
    which each had distinctive national characteristics. Roman type originated in
    Italy in the late 1400s. Originally used mostly for setting texts in Latin, it
    replaced blackletter for almost all printing within about 100 years. German-speaking
    countries were the main exception, and continued to use Fraktur &#40;the German
    version of blackletter&#41; up until the end of WWII. The Nazis decided that san-serif
    typefaces undermined German culture; in all seriousness, some designers who used
    san-serif type actually attracted the attention of the Gestapo. <BR> <BR>It makes
    sense to be aware of the history of the typeface that you use for a particular
    project, to avoid making unintentional typographic jokes. For instance, it would
    look odd to use an classic English or Italian typeface for a book about Rennaisance
    French history when there are a large number of excellent Rennaisance French text
    typefaces to choose from. The same is true of things like menus and signage; you
    can often use type to reinforce a national or ethnic theme. <BR> <BR>Take care,

  body: To get back to the original &#40;very interesting&#41; question about culture-specific
    type features, I&#39;ve been meditating on the case of Ireland and I have a few
    ideas to throw out at you. <BR> <BR>Having abandoned the use of a distinct Gaelic
    alphabet, we&#39;ve been using Times and Helvetica and whatever else we can get
    our hands since the 1960s, but I think there are still a few things that set us
    apart. <BR> <BR>As Gaelic typefaces were never accompanied by matching italics,
    which had no cultural significance or practical use in Ireland at all, you can
    perhaps distinguish a historical tendancy to use punctuation &#40;common&#41;
    and obliques &#40;rare&#41; instead.  <BR> <BR>A font that doesn&#39;t have a
    corresponding italic is already, for me, very slightly more Gaelic than one that
    does.  <BR> <BR>A font that doesn&#39;t have distinct uppercase letterforms and
    simply uses a larger version of its lowercase &#40;and is as a result generally
    more rounded&#41; is also more Gaelic. It is not however always very readable.
    <BR> <BR>A font designed with no dots on its i or j is also a contender.  <BR>
    <BR>Anything that corresponds to all that is the winner. <BR> <BR>Matha. <BR>

    is directly derived from the Cree/Ojibwe system, originally conceived by the Methodist
    missionary James Evans. The Anglican missionary Edmund Peck introduced the successful
    writing system to the Inuit. It is not a script that originates in or has any
    connection to pre-Christian Inuit culture, but the Inuit have since made it their
    own and are very proud of it. [It is also worth noting that most Inuit art you
    see is not traditional: soapstone carving was introduced to the Inuit only in
    the later 20th century.] <BR> <BR>The geometry of the Canadian syllabics derives
    from the very crude type making methods developed by James Evans in the far north
    of Manitoba. He carved matrices in the endgrain of wood, and found straight lines
    easier to work with. The difficulties of making type under such conditions also
    led to the most distinctive aspect of the script: the rotation of symbols to indicate
    different vowel sounds. <BR> <BR>When my colleague Ross Mills was designing the
    Pigiarniq and Uqammaq typefaces for the government and land use corporation in
    Nunavut, he found the Inuit to be quite open to novelties such as an increased
    number of rounded forms. This is a healthy sign: people are more conservative
    and protective of their writing system when they feel their culture to be under
    threat. When people are confident in their culture, they can afford to take a
    <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude and allow experiment. <BR> <BR>For more information
