  body: "I have a copy of this book, although it is currently packed ready to be moved
    later this week. I doubt if I will be able to get at it for a couple of weeks.
    Is there a particular specimen you were interested in, David? I might be able
    to provide some photographs. The binding is quite worn and loose, if I recall
    correctly, so I wouldn't want to subject it to a scanner.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be
    quite rare. I bought my copy from Collinge & Clark in London, and they suggested
    that not many copies of the Berthold Hebrew specimens had survived the Nazi years."

    the faces in which you are interested.
