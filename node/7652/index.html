		<div class="commentbody">I think if it should look like an airplane than make it look like an airplane. If it should look like a man &#40; which is to me what it looks like&#41; than it should look more like a man. I am slightly frustrated with this inkblot type of logo design. Frustrated because in the end you end up with something that looks like too many things. This causes the company to have an indecisive look.  Indecision is bad. Confidence is good. I definatly feel that #3 is the most succesfull. But is still not there. What age group is the xam center targeting?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To Tanya : The assinments come from various of sources. I have some very powerful friends here in Bulgaria, who are in the same kind of business &#40;people from Ogilvy &amp; Mather, McCann Erickson, TBWA, Kres, etc.&#41;. They introduce me to potential clients and I have to work out the rest. ;&#41; &#40;the clients they give me are usually ones with money in their bank accounts, but I don&#39;t use my connections very often, because like everything goes : A favor for a favor. <BR> <BR>Note : The typical client is any incentive businessman, who needs to look professional. <BR>Unfortunately the profit is insufficient, because of the unwillingness of people to pay tantamount to the work that was done.  <BR>How would you react to a cost of 70$ for Corp.Id &#40;and 50$ for a logotype&#41;?  <BR> <BR>Of course, now and then, more generous clients come, but I believe you got the picture. <BR> <BR>Salute to all</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Galin - I like the look of it, but I&#39;m a sucker for dancing figures. I&#39;m not sure why the airplane is relevant - is it just to show aspiration and rising to meet challenges or is there some reason to hold onto the airplane symbol. If not then maybe concentrate on the dancing figure and X within the mark. Adding that third requirement of the glyph increases its workload dramatically. If it is important however - then I think the configuration of #3. It feels very young - but I think the playfulness could still work. I like the idea someone had of simplifying learning center - it needs to form a good base for the figure to dance upon. <BR> <BR>As far as # of corporate IDs a year it depends on the firm. I work in a small department that gets a great deal of its work from small to medium business &#40;under 1.5mil&#41; and some work from larger. As a result I get a great deal of Identities &#40;at least 10-15 a year&#41; sometimes they aren&#39;t of a very high level, but its good experience.</div>
