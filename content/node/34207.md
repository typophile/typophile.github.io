  body: "That logo is custom lettered by Underware, so I guess Bello is close.\r\nBut
    you should also check out <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/home\">Sudtipos</a>,
    where Alejandro Paul and co. sell their script fonts. "

    body: Yeah the Susannah logos from Underware and we tried Bello but it's not suitable.
      But thanks for that link, found some good ones on there that really helped me
      out.
