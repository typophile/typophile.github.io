  ID them. I can't find any better images from the titling, but hopefully you can
  still get an idea. \r\n\r\nThe first image is the title of the show and is the slab
  serif version of the typeface (they're barely dicernable on the top of the L's,
  the N and the H from this image... the legs of the L's are straight).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_typophile_baseballtonight_01_6544.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  second image is the san serif version of the typface (I think the diagonal cuts
  on the S might be helpful).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_typophile_baseballtonight_02_3627.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  help for these is greatly appreciated."

    \">Stratum Black 1</a> sure looks the one for Diamond Cuts,\r\nI don't think they
    are in the same family, look at the S."

  body: "Yeah, you're right on the Stratum 1 (could possibly be Stratum 2). \r\n\r\nRegarding
    the Baseball Tonight, I also thought to that the slabs might have been an addition,
    but I've seen other type laid out in a similar face on the show and I doubt they
    would have spliced something together for it. I'll have to look a little closer
    and try to get a better sample."
