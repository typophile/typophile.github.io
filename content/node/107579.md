  or something similar \u2013 and am at a loss, so any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis
  letterhead was found in the archives of the Wellcome Trust, London whilst I was
  researching into Chemists and Pharmacies of the past. \r\n\r\nThe letterhead dates
  from 1952 and I am after the typeface used in the company logo: Savory & Moore Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe
  distinct features of the lettering shown are:\r\n\r\nLeg of the 'R' descending beneath
  the baseline\r\nNo serifs at the top of the M\r\n\r\nThe dots within the 'O's have
  been added in pencil (I think) so are not part of the typeface.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo

  810\r\n\r\nbut none of these are exactly right.\r\n\r\nMany thanks. \r\n A"
