  anyone have a clue what typeface the word POLSKA is in on these stamps, or can suggest
  something similar?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "The \"S\" in the stamps is quite a better solution than in Magnesium, at
    least to my taste. The Polska face is a fine beauty! If you find out what it is,
    I would be happy to know as well. My guess is that it is not available digitally.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    the point accross for my comps.\r\n\r\nDezcom, if I find out I'll let you know.
    I would guess its not available digitally either."

    could be used. P isn't right, but it is close.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/polska-bellboy_4580.png]"

  body: I'm in Poland at the moment and just saw these very stamps in a stamp album
    in an antique shop in Katowice. I didn't notice any other stamps with the same
    font, although most of them looked fairly recent and my Polish girlfriend remembers
    these particular ones being from the 1970s. I'm looking out for old post office
    signs because I think some of them have the same or a similar font.
