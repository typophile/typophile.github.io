    works decent enough. I made the image below in just a couple of minutes. the \"outline\"
    is an outer glow set after rasterizing the text.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_4398.jpg]"

  body: "Hi hrant....\r\nThank you for even being interested in my post. There was
    no reason to give such a negative post.... I thought my post was about fonts,
    not for someone trying  to be funny at someone's else's expense....You should
    know someone's story before you make fun of them....because..... Their story might
    not be so FUNNY!!!!!!\r\nI did not say I was an accountant...\r\nI said \"I worked
    in accounting\" Sorry to say... There are many aspects to accounting...Not all
    of them being high paying jobs....\r\nAs far as having a computer....My grandson
    needed a computer for school and not being able to afford one, I gave him mine....\r\nI
    am not working right now.... My husband and son passed away and I am having a
    hard time handling it.... I can't afford to get a new computer....so..... I just
    use my phone for right now....\r\nGoing without a computer was my choice.....My
    grandson needed it more than I did...That's what parents and grandparents do for
    their children....\r\nAnd.....\r\nMy iPhone works just fine.... I just can't get
    the fonts I would like to use...That's all......lol\r\n"

    just have difficulty fathoming somebody having an expensive cellphone (plus the
    resultant high monthly bill) but not being able to even go to a public library
    to use a computer (for free). I've had a computer since 1977 but I got my first
    cellphone in February.\r\n\r\nJust for future reference, you can get a chromebook
    (which you can use at a coffee shop, library, etc. if you don't have Internet
    yourself) for about $200.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW, Pixlr (that Jodie mentioned) actually
    has an iPhone version... and it even seems to be free!\r\nhttp://pixlr.com/mobile/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
