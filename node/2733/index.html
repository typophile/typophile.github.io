  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">howdy y'all!!! <BR>I was looking at Reader's Digest Merry Christmas Songbook this holiday season and became riveted on the letterforms in question. I'm wanting to make a digital version of this font, but I can't find the full character set. I bought the Solotype Catalog and they're all in there, but I'm afraid they're not good enuff for me to just scan and use, unless I want to spend a lot of time on each letter. I guess that Hermann Ihlenburg created this type and and this design belonged to American Type Founders (I mighta got that name wrong) for a while. If anyone can suggest how to go about finding more printed samples or even acquiring an original set of the metal type, I would appreciate it. Thnx for reading. <BR>paul <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24234.gif" alt="nymphic letterforms"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">That does look familiar to me, and I spent a little while studying Ihlenburg's body of work, so I am suspecting it is indeed his. <BR> <BR>There is a collection of Ihlenburg stuff at the Cary Library (at RIT in Rochester, New York). At the time it was acquired, David Pankow wrote an article about Ihlenburg's work. I think I have a copy of this, but it is not accessible right now, as we are preparing to move. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is in fact exactly the sort of thing ATF produced a lot of around the turn of the century. <BR> <BR>Your best bet is a book called &quot;Specimens of type, brass rules and dashes, ornaments and borders, society emblems, check lines, cuts, initials and other productions of the American Type Founders Co.&quot;, edited by A Lawson and J Bidwell (New York, Garland, 1981). But that's also a facsimile, so it won't be the best quality. <BR> <BR>Another way would be to track down an actual ATF specimen book, but an early one: I suspect the famous 1923 edition doesn't have this font. FYI, the Lawson book is based [mostly] on the specimen of 1896. <BR> <BR>A third approach is to see if this was ever made available as a phototype face (shudder), although procuring specimens of such would probably cost you something. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I get my stuff mostly from UCLA (used to work there), which has a great typography collection. I don't know the situation in Phoenix (I guess your closest &quot;college town&quot;, unless Flagstaff has something), but if you can tap the help of a college friend  he can do what's called an &quot;inter-library loan&quot; for you on virtually anything. Purchasing: if you get lucky like Nathan, great - keep your eyes open, but don't expect something to just fall in your lap. <BR> <BR>Contacting Dan Solo: it shouldn't be too hard to track him down. But I have a feeling he won't be much help sans cash. BTW, how lousy is the repro in the solo book? Do you have a hi-res scan handy? Just a few glyphs will be enough to tell. And one other thing: the sample would have to be <i>extremely</i> high quality for you to avoid &quot;spending a lot of time on each letter&quot;. And the fact that this was a metal face means that <i>no</i> sample is going to be extremely good anyway&hellip; One thing you could do though is go for the &quot;rough look&quot;. <BR> <BR>Info about ATF: You might start by reading the restrospective in issue 43/44 of the American Printing History Association journal: <a href="http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/current.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/current.html">http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/current.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you Jiminez, Thank you. believe it or not, I was aware of the barmee version of this font and you're right&hellip; it does leave a lot to be desired, and not ust in matters of spacing. There are no lower case letters, virtually no punctuation, and if you copare the letter forms to the ones that i digitized (not to be a snob or anything) secesja misses a lot of the finer subtelties of this fine face (in my own opinion) I was considering just cleaning up the barmee version, but i thought it'd be easier just to start from scratch, even if i had to go to the trouble of finding printed samples of the font. Anyhow, thanks for the heads up, preciate that. any other useful information, feel free to pass it along. Thnx for your interest!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're so right! I had thought of pointing out some of the things that were missing but reckoned you'd work 'em all out for yourself. Boy, what you've got so far on that PDF file is miles ahead in precision. The serifs on uprights are completely different and it's rather difficult to work out from the example of the original which of you is right. One thing I know is that I can't wait for you to get your version finished. I've tried out Secesja on projects and it's much too unstable to trust. I want yours (and soon!) <BR> <BR>I've just been looking at sBob's Nymph, by the way - an extremely free variation which takes its beginning from Nymphic. I'd always wondered how it got that name but assumed it was because of the rash of fairy fonts that were appearing back in the 1990s - WSI's Fairy Scroll Display, for instance. It looks like you're set to be the Prospero (and to hell with bloody old boring Gandalph) of the new Millennium. <BR> <BR>The other near approach is Dave Nalle's Acadian, which he made for Scriptorium in 1994. The letter forms are close in certain instances but his source is different from yours. The note reads <i>Source material from the type collection of Steve Saxe. Original design by H.H.Thorpe (1883)</i>. Now that raises a bit of interesting history, doesn't it? Even in those days folk were copying from and improving on one another's work. Is there a history of this aspect of fo(u)nt evolution, do you know? <BR> <BR>Mb</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&gt;jimenez, <BR>i'm not quite sure what that prospero commet was about, but I rather like gandalf! <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;brian,  <BR>thanks for the criticism. to answer you briefly - yes, these letterforms (of mine) are still in their formative stages. right now i've been focusing more on standardizing the uprights and serifs and just smoothing out the general outline. i'll pay more attention to the ball serifs once i get that outta the way. i think i'll try to standardize them, leaning more toward a ball serif for the uppercase, but i really have been trying to stay true to the printed samples that i have available to me. but that presents another problem&hellip; the quality of the printed samples i have varies, so i'm unsure sometimes how i should proceed. The ball on the falling swash of the C is just one case in point&hellip; I'll post some scan comparisons tomorrow so you can see what i mean. anyhow, the short answer to your question is yes, the ball serifs should be standardized (as much as possible) but i don't believe all of them were the same even in the original font&hellip; like i said i'm just trying to stay true to Hermann. for now this project is just more of a learning experience for me as i'm not eally an &quot;xpert,&quot; just a novice here. This is actually my first attempt at trying to put a font together. (this weekend i was trying to teach my self how to add open type features and was moderately sucessful!) maybe someday if i ever get the polish just right on this one i'll try to realease it for marketing or something. i'd love to hear your other questions though! i've got a question for you, since you're a perfectionist (like i try to be) what do you think of the mismatched spurs (take a look at the C, G &amp; S) Some i've rounded off and some are still sharp on the ends. do you think that detracts from the design? anyhow, thanks for your input. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, I was looking at some information that somebody originaly gave me that tipped me off on the designer of this font and it says that this face originaly belonged to a foundry named MacKellar. <a href="http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Ihlenburg/Ihlenburg.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Ihlenburg/Ihlenburg.pdf">http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Ihlenburg/Ihlenburg.pdf</a></a> <BR> <BR>Anybody know anything about this foundry?

		<div class="commentbody">I really, really like the mismatched spurs. The variation makes the letters themselves more interesting and also gives them a sense of contrast between hard/soft edges. It also looks like it might help when balancing the letters out. With the S, if you used the pokey spur up top, it would have to be even larger than the soft one (already larger than the ones in the C &amp; G), I imagine. Also with the S&hellip;the pointy spur is next to the soft ball terminal, and then at the top, the soft spur is next to a pointy ending&hellip;really nice. <BR>And I've had a question for some time that I just haven't asked about, but it is coming up again while looking at the pdf. Should capitals be wider than the lowercase? Gill Sans is one typeface that really stands out to me, and I don't like using it for that reason. All the capital letters look like they are semibold (in gill.) With nymph, if that's the case, I don't mind it, because it seems to fit the idea of it being a display face. I know with small caps, it's important to have them the same width. Maybe someone can explain more about that? <BR>Oh, and the other questions I had are nothing to worry about. It mostly was just about outlines that looked off, such as how the bottom edge of the curl in the cap R doesn't line up. But that's an easy thing to do, and I'm sure now is something you were saving 'til later. I've always had a bad tendency of not working from general to specific. One day I'll kick the habit for good! <BR> <BR>Liking it a lot though. Bellevue turned me off to ball terminals, but I like them in this! <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Brian, thanks for more great criticism/comments. i sometimes look over things (like the R) i guess i'm still learning a lot in this process. and about Gill Sans, that's one of my favorite faces! althought I hadn't noticed the weight difference before. and yes there is one in Nymphic (a wt diff that is) All the settings I've seen of this font (which is a small number) are with the lower case set with a higher baseline than the caps as in the following scans that i promied i would upload, so here you go&hellip;<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/25001.gif" alt="Scan Comparison">&lt;/font&gt;so as you can see the scan to the left is from the songbook i mentioned in my initial post, the scan to the right is from the solotype catalog. so from the one on the right it seems to me that the ball serif on the C is actually a ball whereas on the right it looks like a teardrop. this is exactly why i am interested in finding more high quality print samples, so i can keep as true to the design as possible&hellip; still looking for those samples tho (can be hard here in rural Arizona) so if anyone has any hot leads for me, i'm still hunting&hellip;</div>
