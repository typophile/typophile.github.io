  our logo -- it garners many compliments and I'd like to stick with it:\r\n\r\nBUT
  -- I can't figure out what font this is.  Up until now, we have limped through with
  vectorized reproductions, but I would really like to know so we can reproduce it
  more easily. \r\n\r\nAnyone recognize it? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CF214

  body: "To make the _4_ use _L_ in Handel Gothic Bold. Rotate _L_ 90 degrees, and
    mirror. Shift up until old lhs side is at level of crossbar for _4_. Clip or extend
    top of new lhs side until it lines up with the other lettes. Paste an _I_ for
    the vertical. Make thickness adjustments to match your logo.\r\nDon"

    well too but still Handel-Gothic-ish.'

  body: "As I've said on this board multiple times in the past, logotypes are rarely
    created by a designer simply picking a typeface and setting the type\u2014they
    almost always involve customization (sometimes mild, often extreme).\r\n\r\nOther
    fonts with similar letterforms and a numeral 4 closer to your sample:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontdiner/dairyland/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paragraph/paragraph/
    [only good for the numerals; doesn't include capitals]\r\n\r\nMost logos are created
    in vector format (the format preferred for printing), which makes them infinitely
    scalable for multiple uses, from letterheads to billboards and trade show graphics.
    Converting them to fixed raster sizes for use on the web is relatively simple;
    not so much the other way around.\r\n\r\nBut, if you've been limping along with
    a vector file that was auto-traced from a printed original, the fonts listed here
    and above should help you recreate a cleaner file. Just don't expect it to be
    a quick and simple process."

  body: 'Another alternative: I used Handel Gothic Bold and added a stroke of 9 for
    CROSS IT. I then used Medium''s ''f'' with no stroke added and stretched it to
    make a mighty close F/4.'

  body: If you have the original vector file you got from the designer it should work
    fine - if you do not then maybe you should contact your designer or even your
    printer and see if they have a copy.

  body: I second Ryuk's suggestion of Chimpanzee--just substitute a capital I for
    the 1 and truncate the ascender on the 4.
