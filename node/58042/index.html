  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>About the Company:</strong></p>
<p>Simplicious is improving the usability of software-applications and websites. Their goal is to design efficient and effective software to improve the user experience.</p>
<p>The idea is to keep it simple on the one hand and to keep a certain beauty in mind on the other hand.</p>
<p><cite><strong>Simplicious:</strong> Simply good, simply delectable, simply delicious. Like salt, use it sparingly to add a twinge of spice and sophistication to any conversation.</cite> (Urban Dictonary)</p>
<p><strong>Concept behind the logo:</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the whole logo the type gets a transformation from univers 55 to sabon roman. Univers with it&rsquo;s straight lines and the exceptional legibility represents the &ldquo;simple&rdquo;-factor. Sabon which looks like it has been designed with a wide-nib ink pen represents the &ldquo;delicious&rdquo;-factor.</p>
<p>In addition to make these two fonts work together, the x-height of the sabon has been adjusted. Only the first and the last &ldquo;s&rdquo; are set in their original typeface. All the rest has been done in FontLab Studio to create this illusion of morphing.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to reading your suggestions on it. (font-selection? typeface? kerning? appearance of the characters themeselves? &hellip;)
I would also appreciate your opinions on the company-name itself in connection with the branch. Is it a good idea to concentrate on typography to give it this touch of seriousness or might most of the people don&rsquo;t recognize the typographic effect and only be confused caused by the inconsistence of the logo?</p>

Do it up, why not!</p>

<p>Do you think a morph from grotesk regular to antique italic (or some calligraphy) is possible? Well, I kind of like this idea a lot, but I am not sure whether this works or not.</p>

Maybe even do a literal split like aluminum has in his comment.

<p><strong>to aluminum:</strong> I agree on your opinion about awkward letterforms. This subtle way of &ldquo;morphing&rdquo; the letters creates some diffusions, especially the &ldquo;plici&rdquo;-part has it&rsquo;s weaknesses. The reason why I decided to &ldquo;morph&rdquo; from letter to letter was that I wanted the finished logo to represent the word &ldquo;simplicious&rdquo; as a unit and not as two seperated parts. Do you think an abrupt change of the typeface after (or at) the &ldquo;l&rdquo; &ndash; maybe by creating an unique &ldquo;l&rdquo; which keeps the two parts together &ndash; and leaving the rest of the characters in their original typeface would work?</p>
<p><strong>to Coe:</strong> I absolutely second you. An abrupt change of the typeface would definitely make it easier to grasp the concept. I am really looking forward to seeing a mockup &hellip; especially because of the swash you&rsquo;ve mentioned.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I would disagree with the direction of the abrupt typeface change. Based on your brief, this doesn&rsquo;t reinforce the name nor the concept of the company. I believe the concept can be done in it&rsquo;s original form, but maybe the typefaces are not the right fit for this particular process. I&rsquo;d explore sticking to two of the same type of typefaces, instead of going from a sans-serif to a serif. You might want to play with the idea of taking one serif, and then create a metamorphosis into a more exaggerated serif typeface. I think that might help with the reduction of awkward letterforms.</div>

<p><strong>to imavery:</strong> Thank you for your constructive feedback. What would you think of starting the word in a modern serif and transform it into some kind of latin serif? Might that do the trick? Maybe end the word in a script typeface?</p>

There have been some really awesome calligraphic open type fonts recently that feature lots of alternative glyphs and look just beautiful. Check this link</p>

<p>to see a couple of em. Also, some of the other fonts have really awesome italics that might be closer to what you&rsquo;re looking for. Again, these are just examples to get the ideas flowing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you a lot for your feedback and proposals.</p>
<p>I agree on <strong>awkward letterforms</strong> as well as on <strong>too subtle to grasp</strong> and so I decided to think about the whole concept again. I once wrote that I like the morph because it represents the word &ldquo;simplicious&rdquo; as a whole without seperating the two parts of it too much. But after some kind of an &ldquo;internal monologue&rdquo; I realized that the word &ldquo;simplicious&rdquo; will alwyas be presented as a whole because of the fact it&rsquo;s the word that&rsquo;s written down and so <strong>the &ldquo;morph&rdquo; is too unspectacular</strong> too make an obvious distinction of the two parts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the time where all your feedback (also from other forums) came in and offered me some kind of playground to experiment with the concept.</p>
<p>The latest version again consists of <strong>Univers</strong> for the &ldquo;simple&rdquo;-part but this time I choose the <strong>65</strong> typeface. For the &ldquo;delicious&rdquo;-part I&rsquo;ve tried some very different typefaces. I ended up with <strong>Bauer Bodoni</strong> which I&rsquo;m very comfortable with. The italic typeface has such a <strong>nice rounding</strong> which &ndash; in my opinion &ndash; transports the content very well. This combination of a bold typeface and a regular italic one creates a nice distinction concerning the <strong>grey value </strong> which I really like a lot.</p>
<p>All in all the new version is more &ldquo;logo&rdquo; than the first one. It still works at very small sizes which was the major problem of the first version because of it&rsquo;s subtlety which was gone as soon as it was smaller. It only looked awkward because of the customized letters and their quality of execution which was far away from the quality of the original letterforms of Univers and Sabon.</p>
<p>I hope you can give me such a <strong>constructive feedback</strong> on the new version as you have given me on the old one. I am really looking forward to your professional critiques.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/uni-baubod_logo_5205.png" alt=""></p>
<p><cite><strong>p.s.</strong> I hope I got the kerning right. I&rsquo;m not too sure about the &ldquo;ci&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;ou&rdquo; but maybe you can help me with this.</cite></p>

Regarding the kerning, I think maybe the &ldquo;ci&rdquo; and &ldquo;ou&rdquo; might look sort of wide because the other letters are connected. If there is a subtle way to connect that &ldquo;c&rdquo; to the &ldquo;i&rdquo; and the &ldquo;o&rdquo; to the &ldquo;u,&rdquo; perhaps that would help.</div>
