  you could get for free.\r\nNow I have a situation where I need them and I just can't
  remember the name of the designer or anything that could point me to them. \r\n\r\nThe
  image linked here is close to what I have in my memories, maybe someone here sees
  what I'm talking about ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErikMarinovich_CinMag_02_6671.gif]\r\n\r\n"

      for now I'll go with the Christmas numerals.\r\nThank you Ryuk, you've been
      helpful."
