  body: 'Funny and cute tail on your #2 "y" - I like! But the overall balance for
    the typeface seems a bit off - too high of an x-height perhaps? #3 is perhaps
    the more balanced of all your designs - it has potential. Your first design doesn''t
    really appeal to me although it may be a useful experiment to keep pushing just
    for the learning experience.'
