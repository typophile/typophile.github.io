  : http://www.ceveritt.com/images/huf.coe.3.jpg\r\n\r\nI wonder how to get the deformation
  of \"Hufnagel\", \"Custom\", and \"cycle\". I tried to do this with Illustrator
  but without success. maybe he to create the letter one by one manually, but I doubt
  it. There is necessarily a way to do it \"cleanly\"\r\n\r\nOther request : \r\n\r\nI
