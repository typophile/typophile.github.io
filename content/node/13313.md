  body: "I don't know if Farsi conventions are different on this, but for Arabic they're
    not bad at all. Assuming Farsi and Arabic are the same, I would make them darker,
    more curvy, and slightly taller.\r\n\r\nBut there are other problems. I don't
    know Farsi, but I can see that:\r\n1) The spacing (especially between words) is
    shaky.\r\n2) The Kaaf in the last word (far left) most probably needs to join
    with the Noon, instead of being the lone form (unless it's some quite peculiar
    Farsi exception).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "thank you for your comments hrant, regarding the spacing - i have no idea
    how i could solve it. the texts are far too long to be adjusted sentence by sentence.\r\n\r\ni
    was also wondering about the kaaf, and i have no idea why it doesn't join - although
    it should most probably. it is really awful to set type without being able to
    understand it.\r\n\r\nthe colon is the default nazanin colon.\r\nat least the
    quotationmarks are correct ;|"

    the tracking and increase the word-space. Like a smile with gappy teeth but good
    teeth.\r\n\r\nBTW, I wonder, what does InDesign optical spacing do with this?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
