body: "Anybody care to take a stab at this? I'm looking for the font used for \"Sprinkles\"
  - I know it may be hand lettered, but it seems clean enough to be a font. I was
  handed this by a client who likes this, all I can see is \"Giddyup\", but hey, it's
  her money. Ed Script is a much better face IMHO, but I'd like to show her this as
  an option if it exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sprinkles_5941.jpg]"

    by someone who has no idea of handwriting: how is this \u2018k\u2019 supposed
    to be written? An \u2018h\u2019 with an acute accent?\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/shinntype/handsome_pro_thin_ot/?sample_text=Sprinkles&sample_size=60\">Handsome</a>,
    among others, is much nicer."

  body: Actually the oddity of the 'k' makes it very nice. Some oddity is good. About
    "Handsome" it is great, but the bar is too high...

  body: Actually, I shouldn't have disparaged the font in my original post... there's
    nothing "wrong" with it, it's quite nice in a quirky kind of way, but it is COMPLETELY
    NOT appropriate for the product that it will be used to promote (either in a logo
    or packaging). Unfortunately, the client has a "thing" for the cupcakes, and this
    is their logo, so I am forced to offer this up as an option and try to talk her
    out of it.
