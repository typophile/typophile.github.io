body: Howdy Typophiles, I've been a lurker for some time but this sign finally brought
  me into the light. I tried Identifont first, but every time I thought I found the
  answer some small detail in the sign proved me wrong. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

  body: I thought the same thing at first, but the angled edge on the inside of the
    G's spur, and the thickness of the N's diagonal stroke, led me to believe otherwise.
    The opening in the G also seems a bit low in comparison to the Bold Condensed
    cuts of Helvetica I've come in contact with.

  body: "The angled edge of the spur is generally on a subtle angle but the stroke
    leading into it isn't as wide as in the sample.. The O is a bit more narrow too.\r\nHere's
    some near-matches with Helvetiva\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/condensed-bold/mac-t1/164260/\r\n\r\nThe
    O here is closer but the G is off.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica-inserat/\r\n\r\n"

  body: Ahhh! I just had a typenerd friend suggest <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/franklin-gothic/extra-cond/">Franklin
    Gothic Extra Condensed</a>, and so far that looks to be the closest, if not actually
    the same typeface.
