  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Typophiles,

and here's my second scetch from the last weeks... a quite old fashioned script called Gulasch (for the time of being).

It's my first script font, so I may do some "stupid" things yet which could be done more efficient if I only knew ...
The general idea is that every lower case characters "ends" at one of three possible levels: low, mid and top; this always stays the same, so every "z" ends mid, every "b" ends top. According to this, the following character has to "adjust" its starting height, so there are three variants to "begin" a character (connects from a low, mid or top predecessor). There is also a variant for beginning of word, having no connector. And ... there are four further variants, for the ending of words ... which make a whopping 8 glyph variants for each character. At the moment, most of these are composed by  components in fontlab, so this works quite well, but anyway it's quite a lot of burocracy (and later, i'd like to decompose and fine tune each variant).

What do i want to know?
General thoughts and ideas concerning the big picture, future expansion, future reduction (glyph count...), and if possible lots of tips how to do a script like this more efficiently.

thanks for your feedback
Sebastian</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know much about the technical stuff, but I really like the look of this! I especially like the ss in "Quadraturerlass" for some reason.  The "rprogn" in  "Elementarprognose" create kind of an unusual rhythm, all of them hanging from a straight line on top, but it doesn't seem too disconnected from the rest of the text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Making the connections meet halfway can result in some abruptly visible joins. As your design stands, I think you could eliminate many of the variant forms by having all low and middle connections extend entirely from the leading letter to disappear into the beginning(/low/middle) form of the following letter. The top connections should extend entirely from the top form of the following letter. A full set would still be needed for a few exceptional cases such as s.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great design.

To make it look more naturally handwritten, maybe the lowercase g and uppercase G should connect from the tail, not from the top. Also the lead into the lowercase e is often higher than where a handwritten e would start. In fact, could you just get rid of the top-ending glyphs? That would make it easier to lead naturally into the e's, n's, m's etc. and would make your life easier with the design!

tt ligature would also be a good addition I think.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, you are creating an unique font.
the rythm it has is not very usual in fonts out there.
However, I believe that it is not easy to think its design the way you are thinking.
The connection meetings, being each character "active", could make the joins look weird sometimes.
I'd think of 2 solutions.
1. The hardest, maybe, is to design conflictive pairs in one glyph. (Then use the open type function of ligatures)
2. Changing the method: think of longer terminals, so you make the connections more credible and good looking. You will need at least 3 glyphs of each character. The a with the long (low) terminal, the a with the long (middle) terminal and the a for the long (high) terminal. With this I mean, It is easier to think of a script font when the connection of the two glyphs has an active and a passive protagonist.
The first glyph, the active; the second one the passive, who is "touched" by its neighbour terminal.

Hope this helps,
Best
