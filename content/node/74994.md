body: "I'm looking for a typeface to complement Zapf Humanist in a logo. Humanist
  is used for the professional part of the name, but I need a softer font for the
  part which illustrates an alliance between two opposites.\r\n\r\nI suggested Caflisch
  Script, but the client didn't like the combination.\r\n\r\nAny help would be really
  appreciated!"

  body: Gudrun designed Columbine that will work well with Optima. And try Zapfino...
    it could add some sparkle.

  body: Maiandra has similar classic proportions, but its soft "brushy" finish is
    kind of the opposite of Optima's chiseled look.
