  body: ' Sure, it&#39;s a pretty common term.  It refers to relief carvings where
    the sculpted image &#40;like a head or face&#41; is cut in a layer that contrasts
    with the background layer - i.e. a different colour. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also used
    to mean a small role played by a famous actor in a play or movie. <BR> <BR>Paul '
