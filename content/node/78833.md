  body: "I don't think I've ever seen this in digital form (or any other form \u2014
    not in PL catalogs I have either). In searching MYFonts I found <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pintassilgo/cuadrifonte/\">Quadrifonte
    Fill</a> as about the closest to this feel. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/Freddo/fonts/\">ITC
    Freddo</a> is also quite a bit in this vein.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Do you not think it is hand-drawn? It's got a filled-in-graph-paper look.
    Compare the Os.\r\nThe album was released in 2010. Being Stereolab, they might
    have found some obscure pre-digital typeface or process but I think it is custom.
    There's a slightly larger picture of the grey version of the cover [[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=2530462|here]]. "
