  pixel and not 'too Din' - some uniqueness and ('quirky technical') character is
  needed here. I'm looking for bigger typographic family with CE characters to use
  in identity for an art project. I quite like Stormtype Etelka but first want to
  make sure there's nothing better. The above form could be slightly corrected to
  go with a typeface. Any recommendations appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n___\r\nAL"
