  think that the green text and gray text are in different fonts...\r\nI tried many
  font id services, but nothing specific came up. Here is the image:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://a.insft.com/site/infusionsoft.com/theme/2011/infusion-logo.png\">
  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: "The logo would appear to be a customized  reworking of Lucida Sans, used
    only for the logo. Theire other materials use Lucida Sans.  What you see as two
    different fonts are different weights of the same custom design.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "Thank you, guys! I think that this is definitely not lucida sans. However,
    managed to find some very similar/if not the same characters with Karat Medium,
    ITC Kabel Standart, some others installed on my laptop. \r\n\r\nI am in the graphics
    business for about 10 years and this is my first font request, so I am thankful
    to anyone.  "

    produce a working custom font based on an existing font?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
