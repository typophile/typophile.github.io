  files to attach.\r\n\r\nSaw these somewhere on the web in 2006 and saved them. Don't
  know even what they are now, just png files. Somewhere it was typed that they are
  \"Annie,\" but in trying to find a place to buy them, I don't find an \"Annie\"
  that looks like these. They have Alt and beginnings. To me they look a little like
  GeeohHMK, but don't match in some letters exactly. Can anyone please help? Thank
  you.\r\np.s. Here are the images now. I have more if needed. Thanks."

    Hallmark font you mentioned). Greyhound Script is one, Hairspray from FontHaus,
    and Cruz Ballpoint (P22) is another. Nick Curtis's Whirled Peas is also similar.
    You can use some of these as \"Fonts By Similarity\" choices at Identifont.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi, Mike,\r\nThank you for taking your time to try to find this font. Can
    it be made into a font?  I have all of the alphabet upper lower, alt. beginnings,
    endings, etc. I went through each of the \"similar fonts\" on identifont... no
    help there although Adios and Gnosis are very pretty. I wish that the letters
    I have could be made into a font. What would I need to do that? These alphabet
    letters I have are so much nicer and prettier and subtler than any of the aforementioned
    fonts. I would like to know your opinion.\r\nThank you."

    etc., what would I need to make this into a font? I really would like to make
    it into a font. These are such pretty letters. Is the question too na\xEFve, or
    would it require too large a space to answer? Thanks to anyone who might take
    me seriously. I want to make a font out of these letters."
