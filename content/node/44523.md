  the registered Pennsylvania Typophiles to get out and vote. Especially so, if you're
  a Democrat.\r\n\r\nI'm an Obama guy myself. Don't let that sway you, it's more important
  that you vote period!\r\n\r\nNeed Help: http://www.dos.state.pa.us/voting/\r\n\r\nEven
  if you're not registered, still attempt. They'll help you fill out a provisional,
  and a registration form, so that you can vote in November.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vintage-retro-123_5731.jpg]"

    Dichotomy and Is There Any Other Choice?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe in Germany cannot
    figure out why you are even bothering to hold an election.\r\n\r\nOn one side,
    you have a bitch who is a lawyer, married to a lawyer . . . and a lawyer who is
    married to a bitch who is a lawyer.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, you have a war hero
    married to a good looking woman with big tits who owns a beer distributorship.\r\n\r\nIs
    there a contest here?\r\n\r\n"

    to think the American people take a little more care in choosing their leaders
    - altho recent elections have not inspired much hope in that regard."

    too passionate. :^P\r\n\r\nBut I have to say I've been very disappointed in all
    of the  name calling. Instead of discussing the issues I mean. Really. It makes
    me sick to my stomach to think it has to happen like this. Why can't someone be
    the bigger person?\r\n\r\nNow. Let's not get into it anymore than we have. \r\n\r\nBut
    people, if you have a chance to vote today, you should go out and exercise that

    start of this century.\r\n\r\nI can remember Bill Cosby on Johnny Carson giving
    a message for all to hear to Eddie Murphy. I believe that Eddie Murphy got the
    message and his sense of comedy began changing.\r\n\r\nGood humor will last through
    the decades - look at Abbott & Costello, anyone from Laugh-In days, Monty Python,
    etc. etc. Like Patty, I don't mean to offend a soul here - but, I'd love to see
    us get together for a good laugh. \r\n\r\nWhat the world needs - especially in
    troubled times like these - is a good sense of humor."

    to include \u2013prior to a good sense of humor\u2013 a degree of maturity. \r\n\r\n\"Let

    PA campaign headquarters. Afterward I popped in and scored some of those neat
    posterized-looking Obama stickers that say "Hope" in Gotham at the bottom (sort
    of like the image Andrew posted, actually). I had to pretend to be a PA resident
    to get them, but, you know, whatever...
