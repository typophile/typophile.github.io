    but the M is different. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/"
    target="_blank">Geometric 415</a> is close. <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Neutraface</a> &#40;from House Industries&#41; would work. <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/" target="_blank">Avenir</a>
    is OK too but some characters are different. Can&#39;t easily find an exact match
    but any of the above should do the trick. Neutraface gives you the funky 33.

    never digitized&#41;, but if you need the funky 3  <BR>House&#39;s Neutraface
    is your best bet indeed.

  body: Thanks for all that, Patricia and Yves. Jasper, Berry and Johnson have a showing
    of Granby, from Stephenson Blake, that has a similar 3, but other things don&#39;t
    quite match. I&#39;m wondering if the 3s were from a different font. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    I&#39;m thinking that maybe Relay would be another font that could pass. <BR>
    <BR>Again, thanks.
