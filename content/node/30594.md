body: "Background:\r\nThis is a series of logos that I designed for a re-branding
  project done with a copywriter and art director. The concept, as well as the language
  of the copy, is geared towards the medieval period in the sense that the Kong toy
  acted as a \"dragon slayer\" in relation to the dog. It keeps your dog at bay, and
  from \"pillaging\" the place. We wanted to keep it fun and playful while speaking
  to this idea.\r\n\r\nThe Kong type is from scratch. I would appreciate some suggestions
  and feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoseph"

    common on dark-ages-retaled design, my favorite is #2. I think it will be more
    flexible and easier to integrate within the company''s visual identity.'

  body: Thanks for the reply, fernandoLins. I guess I forgot to mention why there
    is more than one logo shown. This is a series, which would all be used. The top
    logo, with the dogs, would be used on the packaging. The dogs could be switched
    out with cats, or birds, etc. The middle is the main logo which could be used
    anywhere, such as banners, etc. The bottom logo would be used on advertisements,
    and could be shown hung from a pole, either coming out from the bottom or the
    side of the ads -- much like they would appear in a battle scene or such, in those
    days.

  body: I'd have to vote for the second one as well. Due to the expression on the
    dog's faces & the tongues it just looks like they're humping the logo in the first.
    The third might be just a little cluttered for use as a logo.

  body: "These are great! Fresh and distinctive, yet still sufficiently compatible
    with the earlier branding that it won't be jarring to the consumer. (Yes, I'm
    a fan of the products). Far too often I've seen package redesigns that don't take
    customer familiarity into account, to the point I had trouble recognizing a product
    as the same thing, even when the name remained the same. Here you have preserved
    the bold red letters of the original Kong logo and done something new with it,
    but not so much as to destroy famiiarity. Good job!\r\n\r\nBut I would reconsider
    the rampant hounds astride the edges of the shield. It does look like they're
    enjoying it in a manner unworthy of a chew toy."
