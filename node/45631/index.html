		<div class="commentbody">Ciao,
Whether the two words are concatenated or you "keep em separated", at different times thruout history "old style" has been used to refer to so-called "hanging" figures as well as the typeface designs (styles) of men such as Francesco Griffo and Nicolas Jenson. From the potted history I wrote for Wikipedia:

<em>In Italy the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian or "old style" Latin types, also called antiqua.</em>

<em>The name "roman" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman "antiqua" from its connection with the humanistic "lettera antica"; "medieval" and "old-style" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by Aldus Manutius (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.

See also: Incunabulum</em>

I think lettera antica and Venetian are better terms for the type style formerly known as "old style".

As for 'old style' numerals: 
<strong>text</strong> no, that could mean several different things
<strong>old-style</strong> no, anachronistic & outmoded, the game has moved on
<strong>lower case</strong> no, I can think of more telling nomenclature than that.

<strong>x-body</strong> because these figures have x-height bodies. Some have extenders, and some, such as 1 and 2, are x-body only.

Ciao,
j a m e s</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with the term "text" is that is is just as opaque as the term "oldstyle." If you use full caps in text, as some constructions seem to require, you should use lining figures. Whether or not one should ever use full caps in text is a different matter, but some editorial styles require it. And on balance (for instance), I think newspaper sections with page numbers (e.g., C2) do require full caps.

In any event, the advantage to "lowercase" and "uppercase" as terms is they do somewhat refer to what figures should be used in what contexts.

Having said that, I'm with Will. In informal conversations, I confess to still using the term "oldstyle." </div>

On the Oxford American Dictionaries, on the Mac OS X, when searching for "oldstyle" the result is none. Old Style is found.

We have:
Old Style
Oldstyle
Old-Style

I have a feeling that it could actually be said as: Oldestyle. Just a thought. All of this bring us to, not two options, but four. I could also suggest a way out, by opting for a 'quantum' approach: There is four options, just shuffle them and pick one result. If after you pick one and you don't like it, then you can repeat as many times as you want, until you are satisfied.
