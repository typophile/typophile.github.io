  the regular weight is 95% done but I&#39;ve been working on a bold / slab-type weight
  for it as well: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47697.gif"

  not sure of it as a whole. <BR> <BR>thanks for any advice, <BR> <BR>andrew'

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>Andrew, I think that the slab serif one is great..
    <BR> <BR><i>Its about time for some bigger &#40; and bolder &#41; pixel types..</i>

  body: Pretty cool - yeah, I like large bitmaps too. Upto about 22 they actually
    make fine sense. <BR> <BR>Is there a reason the Bold is 1 pixel taller? <BR> <BR>In
    the Bold, the &#34;k&#34; and especially the &#34;r&#34; need work. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: very nice! the only thing i would change would be to add serifs to the descenders
    of p and q. but that&#39;s just a stylistic change, so take it or leave it. keep
    up the good work!

  body: thanks for the replies! <BR> <BR>hrant - I have been worried that the 1 px
    difference presents a usage problem, but this was the cleanest way to create an
    accurate slab version of the regular weight. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also working on
    a more &#39;proper&#39; bold with the same height as the regular. <BR> <BR>also,
    yes the &#39;k&#39; and the &#39;2&#39; are definitely presenting problems - 3px
    wide diagonals are too thick, 2px are too thin.

    based on baskerville, utopia, &#34;treasury of alphabets and lettering&#34; by
    jan tschichold, and my own sensibility. <BR> <BR>Andrew
