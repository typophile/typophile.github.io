  body: "I don't think this is monospaced, it's just that the letter spacing has been
    made very wide. This looks like an old style from 30's or earlier. I don't recognize
    it offhand. But I am looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    FontBank may have had a heavier weight in their collection, but it would not have
