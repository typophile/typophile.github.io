    break. Now it seems to point too high on the stem.

  body: "You're trying to tuck the 2010 ROAD in there, but to me it seems a tad too
    close to the as. Could it be a point or so smaller?\r\n\r\nAlso wondering about
    the emphasis. Atlas is already large, and to me, making it bold while the 2010
    ROAD is less heavy, makes me read atlas-2010-road, rather than 2010-road-atlas.
    \r\n\r\nI am curious if it would read any differently to me with a heavier 2010
    ROAD and a more hairline atlas. Maybe the fact that atlas is so much bigger wont
    let that resolve itself, in which case, I wouldn't mind seeing 2010 ROAD in a
    heavier weight itself."

    Again it's a generalized term. This is how i'm thinking about using it. hopefully
    client feels the same way. =) \r\n\r\nupdated the lane idea. thoughts? comments

  body: Ya know I'm actually quite intrigued by these road/lane ideas. Liking the
    first better than the second. Definitely the middle inline stroke has lots of
    problems. But my general beef is that the cap height of ATL (space) A is all the
    same. I want rhythm! Maybe the top of the TL can come down a bit lower. You should
    fix that up, even if the arrow version is the solution, just for fun.

  body: "Yeah, looks like the driver found some acid in the glove compartment, and
    is now going to the moon. :-)\r\n\r\nMust say I really like both your concepts
    though. Solid. FWIW the only thing I'm wondering about is how \"2010 ROAD\" is
    treated as one visual unit; I'd expect this to read \"2010 | ROAD ATLAS\", not
    \"2010 ROAD |\_ATLAS\" if you know what I mean. I see that both of those aren't
    as important as \"ATLAS\", but I'd maybe try taking them apart a bit more (at
    least in the \"arrow\" concept)."

    is definitely going to find that ROAD atlas useful. "
