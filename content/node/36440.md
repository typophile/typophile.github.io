  East Village, when a fellow wearing a <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0001260\"><strong>KERN
  zip-up</strong></a> walked up to the bar. Of course I noticed it, and said \"Nice!,\"
  then promptly showed him my FontShop \"SemiBold\" t-shirt, which I happened to be
  wearing. He told me he now had a tech job, but had once done design at an agency.
  And then he said, \"There were some art directors there who would see this and ask
  me what it meant!\"\r\n\r\nSad but true."
