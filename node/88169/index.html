• the random and almost incomprehensible UI of Adobe Acrobat
• Indesign CS4, 5, and 5.5 having unnecessary version incompatibility with older versions</p>
<p>I am only interested in writing about glaring flaws that slow down workflow, require multiple applications to be combined for simple functionality, hamper cross-platform workflows. I am especially interested in problems that hamper teaching students to use basic functionality of applications. I do not want to just air my personal gripes. So before I proceed I want to know if other designers, teachers, and students have found issues that consistently waste time and cause problems over months or years.</p>

<p>Can you give an example of this? (I&rsquo;m assuming you are talking about backward compatibility, opening older documents in the newer version. Expecting <em>forward</em> compatibility for the complicated structure a fully laid-out and formatted document is, is way, way too naive.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m standing still at home, but we get updated regularly at work. As someone who uses Illustrator every day, I have to say each new version has been a real boost to productivity. I really miss CS5 when I&rsquo;m working from home (CS3).</p>
<p>Sticking point for me is Acrobat, which I&rsquo;ve been having to use more often. Really not the same type of environment. It seems like they are trying to make it feel familiar to Microsoft Office users.</p>

<p>unnecessary version incompatibility with older versions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On many occasions I&rsquo;ve wished that InDesign had better backwards compatibility, but I&rsquo;m not sure that &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; is the appropriate word. I used to know the lead programmer for a major software application and he said that backwards compatibility was a problem with many applications and that insisting on backwards compatibility would often force compromises in other areas (like new features) which users wouldn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>In any event, if you know your files are also also going to be worked on by someone else, it&rsquo;s always best to both use the same version. That&rsquo;s why I keep the last 3 versions of InDesign on my Mac.</p>

Image windows overlap toolbars, so accessing any menu, feature or tool is impossible without first moving, or resizing all of the open windows. In CS3 all image windows went nicely underneath. I don&rsquo;t like tabs, as I am used to dragging layers, selections etc. from one window to another, but now can&rsquo;t use the new overlapping windows either.</p>

I find the difference in shortcuts to be bewildering (it goes without saying that Acrobat is the worst in this respect: for example, why on Earth they choose <kbd>ctrl</kbd> as a modifier key for zoom out?).
Also, Illustrator,* which I use rarely (and that made it even worst), has very limited contextual menus for basic operations like copy &amp; paste and then there’s the “inverted” y (but this seems to be fixed in CS5: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/infiniteresolution/2010/05/ruler_updates_in_illustrator_c.html)">http://blogs.adobe.com/infiniteresolution/2010/05/ruler_updates_in_illustrator_c.html)</a>.</p>

<p>What version of Indesign allows this? I have had to export one format in CS4 to CS3, a different format to go from CS5 to CS4, and going from CS5 to CS3 seems to require stepping through CS5 and CS4. I understand why the newer functions of CS4 and CS5 cannot be saved directly back to older versions, but it is really nuts that I cannot just open older versions, make minor edits, and then save the same file without changing to the newer format. This has been a real problem with teaching because I and my students end up moving between all three versions of Indesign at school/work/home machines.</p>

Still no kerning table feature in InDesign.

Another annoying thing is that that consistently embed less fonts with each new version&hellip; No more Jenson, no more Arno or Garamond Premier. No fonts with optical sizes&hellip; I guess they have successfully topped the market now and don’t need to pursuade people with these goodies anymore.

<p>Yes, but the teacher pricing does not work on upgrades. So the price for a new educational version winds up being about the same as a normal upgrade. That&rsquo;s why I also tend to skip the alternate version of CS. It costs almost a grand to get a new version of the CS Master Collection.</p>

<p>My opinion? A nasty, nasty, nasty move, only devised to generate lots of cash on a short notice (they are pressing people to upgrade <em>now</em> to CS5) but utterly alienating heaps of clients in the long run who do <em>not</em> want, need, or can pay to upgrade Every-Single-New-Version.</p>

<p>No, they were marketers.
One problem with Adobe is that marketers are spreading throughout (see: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/08/adobe-layoffs">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/08/adobe-layoffs</a>)</p>

<p>You missed the other part of my comment. I don&rsquo;t buy upgrades. I buy new educational packages, which cost about the same.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard that Adobe was going to the continual upgrade policy. I suspected it when they started limiting the number of versions you could upgrade from.</p>
<p>The thing is, the advantages in upgrading are much less than they once were. The difference between PS 4 and 5 was massive, and you were crazy not to upgrade &hellip; even if you had to buy a new computer. Now only minor improvements are appearing.</p>
<p>Adobe might find this policy backfires on them, and people will just stop upgrading. I mean, carpenters don&rsquo;t buy a new hammer every year when the new models come out. And plumbers don&rsquo;t get a new pipe wrench every year. (Which is not to say that graphic designers are high paid craftsmen of that type, but you get the idea.)</p>

(I know about the world-ready composer, but it&rsquo;s so inaccessible as to be unusable.) Also, InDesign should have real tools for math typography built in.

<p>I&rsquo;m sympathetic to your viewpoint, but the analogy has some flaws.</p>
<p>I put off upgrading to CS 5.5, but recently a corporate client sent me an InDesign 5.5 file and asked me to make some changes to it. My options were 1) upgrade to 5.5, or 2) tell my client I didn&rsquo;t have 5.5, look like a cheapskate who couldn&rsquo;t afford to keep his software current, and probably lose the job.</p>
<p>So I upgraded.</p>
<p>If you work in a collaborative environment in which you share native files with co-workers, clients and vendors, it&rsquo;s difficult to avoid upgrading periodically. I look at it as part of the cost of doing business.</p>

<p>I agree on a professional level, but this is a serious problem in schools. Schools don’t have the resources to update their labs for every release, but students cannot buy older versions. In some cases I have students working in class on CS4, at home on 5.5, and at work on 5. It gets really bad with the Windows users, because Illustrator for Windows does not the dialogue to save for older versions like the Mac version does.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Regarding the <em>blog.idmllib.com/&hellip;/indesign-cs5-and-the-missing-inx-export/</em> link and the steps it describes for CS5 users to exchange data with CS3 users, this is what James Puckett complained about: You need at least two versions of CS. First, from CS5 to CS4 via IDML. Then, from CS4 to CS3 via INX (and to CS2 with an additional hack). At least one user needs both CS5 and CS4, or both CS4 and CS3.</p>
<p>Related, I cannot say that I am particularly amused when reading an announcement like <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/adobe-creative-cloud-and-adobe-creative-suite-new-choices-for-customers.html" target="_blank">this</a>, in particular:</p>
<p><cite>For customers who prefer to remain on the current licensing model, [&hellip;] In order to qualify for upgrade pricing when CS6 releases, customers will need to be on the latest version of our software (either CS5 or CS5.5 editions). If our customers are not yet on those versions, we’re offering a 20% discount through December 31, 2011 which will qualify them for upgrade pricing when we release CS6.</cite></p>
<p>This is not an &lsquo;offer&rsquo; except maybe in a mafia sense of the term – an offer you better don&rsquo;t reject: Either you upgrade to the current version. Or you are excluded from future ones. Please correct me if I got this wrong.</p>
<p>Such bits and pieces, technical obstacles on the one hand, licensing obstacles on the other hand, make it difficult for me to remain a loyal Adobe customer even though I like the applications. (Same for Apple, by the way, just to indicate that this is not about anti-Adobe sentiments.)</p>
