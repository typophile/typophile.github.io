  body: "Hi Joshua,\r\n\r\n\u2018Moutard\u2019 looks like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/revenue/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D87%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DMOUTARD%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D24\">Revenue</a>;
    maybe a bit stretched.\r\nFor \u2018Champagne\u2019, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/engravers_roman_bold/?&sample_text=CHAMPAGNE&sample_size=60\">Engravers
    Roman</a> is very similar, though no cigar.\r\nThe script is an Anglaise, and
    might be custom \u2013 note the swashes. For alternatives, see <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-champion-script-pro/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D87%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DP%25C3%25A8re%2520%2526%2520Fils%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D40\">Champion
    Script</a> or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D87%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DP%25C3%25A8re%2520%2526%2520Fils%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D31\">Bickham
    Script</a>; they both have tons of alternate glyphs and swashes to play around
    with. <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/script/Novia\">Novia</a> is another
    fine copperplate script. Even more options in this list of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/copperplate_scripts/?&sample_text=P%C3%A8re%20%26%20Fils&sample_size=96\">Formal
