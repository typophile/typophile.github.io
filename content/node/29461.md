    by Tobias Frere-Jones is a modern version that is quite similar to the sample.\r\n\r\n-

    - she bought Nour&Patria* to set her impressive \"From Ararat to Angeltown\",
    and I also did some light typographic consulting on that for her. I'll email her.\r\n\r\n*

  body: "I agree it looks like letterpress, but I was trying to ID the typeface, and
    a close digital version if possible. I'll be interested in Emily's answer.\r\n\r\n-
