    the use of the red stamp.

    would like it a lot. Wine labels should be classic to come extent not to confuse
    consumers.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: The text rag is a little extreme for me. Otherwise nice!

  body: I think the text rag gives the label an interesting personality. I love the
    craftsmanship on everything. It seems to me like a high class scotch label more
    than a wine label for some reason. Probably because it is not attached to a bottle
    of wine.

    a impression as if it was printed letterpress.

  body: "It has some nice features. Like the hand-lettering touch and the beautiful
    letterpress printing.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like the use of all caps for
    the body (bottle) copy. Plus the over tracked letters and line spacing cause readability
    issues. My eyes started getting buggy."
