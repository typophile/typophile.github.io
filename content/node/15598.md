  font that looks like it could one of several common fonts, but I've ruled out Garamond,
  Goudy and Adobe Caslon. I'm attaching three samples to allow you to see more of
  it. Any suggestions? Thanks a million for your help.\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\nHere are the
  samples again. This time enlarged a bit for easier viewing. Sorry but this is all
  I've got to go on."

  body: "I'm not so sure about New Century Schoolbook. The sample looks more monotone
    than Century, and the shape of the G and S seem a bit off. I was first thinking
    of Bookman, but the R is wrong. Then I started looking at slab serifs. For some
    reason the FontBook shows <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-706/italic/testdrive.html?s=DESIGN+%26+TECHNOLOGY+CREDITS&p=16\"
    target=\"new\">News 706 (Aurora)</a> as a slab. I think the C is more open, like
    the sample, and the G has the higher chin, and the S has a straighter midsection,
    all like the sample.  I'm not sure this is the font, but I think it might be closer.\r\n\r\n-
