  fantastic from the screen grab) \u2014 lots of variation in the letters, so I'm
  guessing not a typeface. Any suggestions for something similar? Or indeed if it
  is a typeface, the one in question?\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for the help!\r\n\r\nHigashi"

    Bold</a>, maybe with some horizontal stretching added.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
