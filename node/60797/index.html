I'm expanding the logo above into a full set of uppercase characters to be used on posters and flyers for the theatre. I'm trying to keep the characteristics intact, like the strong letterforms and low crossbar on the A. I want the letters to look more like type on the sides of old factory buildings or 30s era WPA posters rather than mechanical or robotic.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alley_set_2_6114.jpg]
This set of letters is what I was going for but I want to make sure letters like the M, N, X, and K fit with the rest of the type.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alley_set_1_5191.jpg]
I tried to make the letters more a like but I think the M, N, X, K now look a bit too sci-fi or robotic.

I've also included a couple of alternate character designs that I haven't decided on yet like Q and S. I haven't finished adding all the pylons for the stencil look, but I've got a start on it. Any feedback would be appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">I do need to finish adding the stencil cuts to most of the letters. I haven't decided yet if I should add them to all the letters that wouldn't actually need them to function as a stencil. It seems to be working with the E, F, L and S. I don't know how yet to handle it with the Y or T.

The logotype is still subject to change, so the Y and T might end up with cuts. Suggestions on how to handle it? I've looked to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_oxide_stencil_ot_regular/|FF Oxide Stencil]] for some inspiration, but not all the letters feature a pylon since the Stencil version is for actually cutting stencils I'm sure, not just the style of the stencil letter.

You'll see <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/applyinteractive/arston-stencil/">Arston Stencil</a> cuts it differently.

I'd also like to see a 2 stroke Y as an alternative.

As far as lowering the crossbars, I'd try it, but you're likely to get looking pretty funky. Either way, just make sure you do it on the G, too if you do.</div>

I found that trying to modify the K, E, F, G etc... to fit the low cross bar of the A and Y was just too awkward so I'd rather either just keep the K and A as they are or raise the crossbars. Which looks better? And which cuts do you prefer for the N, M, W?

Also working on the angle and weight of slashes and height of brackets.

		<div class="commentbody">Looks good. I think it was a good choice to at least make alternative characters for the higher crossbar. The new cuts help a lot and I REALLY like the new Y. Fits the typeface better. The first of each of the M N W are my choice, but if you can include alternatives, I'd keep em hiding in the background. 

The one thing I notice now is that the 4 doesn't feel as boxy as the rest of the glyphs. I'd see if you could draw it in a more fork-ish shape. Possibly borrowing from the first Y.</div>

Great progress.

I'm looking at the font, and I really like it too. I would keep all alternatives. This way you won't have problems in the logo. 

As for the logo, to me no. three looks really better, but needs some kern. As for the cap 'A': i keep wondering if you could maybe cut the left terminal altogether, like the 'E', I keep thinking that in a real stencil it would not work like you have now. Take a look at: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/glaser-stencil/]]...

good luck!

All the instances I see of the A need more spacing to be even with the rest of the face. I'd be careful of your kerning pairs.
