body: "From a background of narrative visual arts, Choz has developed a passion for
  type design, and is the founder of !Exclamachine Type Foundry. He designs commercial
  and freeware faces. Choz is dedicated to moving display and experimental faces forward
  with modern type features and cultural relevance. He seeks to cultivate an appreciation
  for the application of display type amongst not only the trained designer, but the
  everyday artist, artisan and visual hobbyist. Popular releases include the \"grunge
  font\" !Sketchy Times, casual script !PaulMaul, and a revival of J. B. Silvestre's
  1843 ornamental alphabet as the Creative Commons font !Limberjack.\r\n\r\nWhen not
  designing or marketing type and alphabet-related products, he paints, writes, reads
  /., restores classic cars and drinks coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Choz\" rhymes with \"Jaws\"
  and \"Oz\". It is a nickname."
