body: "Can anyone suggest some good OpenType fonts that are good for running text
  and have good latin <em>and</em> classical greek character sets? \r\n\r\nSome examples
  would be Adobe's <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1719.html\" title=\"Check
  out the font\">Minion Pro</a> and the new <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/garamond/garamond.html\"

  body: Nothing in particular, Si, but old-style figures would be nice. Mostly, I
    just want to take advantage of the automatic ligatures with OpenType and Adobe
    CS products.
