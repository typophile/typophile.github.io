  mammoth budget gaps and sharply lower revenue \r\n\tare looking to residents to
  bail them out.</p>\r\n\t<p>Right now, at least 47 states are facing significant
  shortfalls in their \r\n\t2009 and/or 2010 budgets, according to the Center on Budget
  and Policy \r\n\tPriorities, a think tank in Washington, D.C. And many of those
  states are \r\n\tlooking to tax hikes to help fill the gaps.</p>\r\n\t<p>\u201CPretty
  much everyone is doing poorly,\u201D says Kim Rueben, senior research \r\n\tassociate
  at the Tax Policy Center. \u201CIt\u2019s just a question of who\u2019s hurting
  \r\n\tmore than others.\u201D</p>\r\n\t<p>The top honor goes to California, which
  is projecting that it will fall \r\n\tabout $25 billion short come fiscal 2010.
  Taking second place is New York \r\n\twith a projected $17.6 billion deficit for
  fiscal 2010, according to the \r\n\tNational Conference of State Legislatures, a
  bipartisan policy research \r\n\torganization in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\t<p>How
  can these states miss the mark so badly? The recession has sapped the \r\n\ttwo
  major sources of state revenue: income taxes (thanks to rising \r\n\tunemployment,
  fewer people are getting paid) and sales taxes (quite simply, \r\n\tconsumers are
  spending less.) \u201CThose two things together really, really lead \r\n\tto a high
  loss of tax revenues, far in excess of loss of income,\u201D says \r\n\tMichael
  Hicks, director of Ball State University\u2019s Center for Business and \r\n\tEconomic
  Research.</p>\r\n\t<p>Even though raising taxes are typically a last resort, many
  states have \r\n\tno choice but to do so. And, in some, lawmakers are leaving no
  stone \r\n\tunturned when it comes to finding items or services to tax. New York,
  for \r\n\tinstance, has raised taxes on tobacco, wine and limo services. Meanwhile,
  \r\n\tMassachusetts is proposing a tax on satellite television service and Georgia
  \r\n\tlawmakers are proposing a \u201Cpole tax\u201D that would charge gentlemen\u2019s
  club \r\n\tpatrons $5 at the door.</p>\r\n\t<p>To figure out which states are inflicting
  the biggest tax hikes on \r\n\tresidents, SmartMoney pored over reports from tax
  research groups and \r\n\tcontacted state budget offices. We looked at state budget
  deficits tracked \r\n\tby the National Conference of State Legislatures and current
  sales tax rate \r\n\tdata from the Federation of Tax Administrators, a group that
  provides \r\n\tservices to state tax authorities. Finally, we turned to the Tax
  Foundation \r\n\t\u2014 a nonpartisan tax research group \u2014 for figures on tax
  burden, the average \r\n\tpercentage of each state\u2019s residents\u2019 income
  that is paid in state and local \r\n\ttaxes (the figures we use are for 2008).</p>\r\n\t<p>Here
  are six states where residents should prepare to pay up.</p>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124517776696719927.html\">\r\n\t<img

  </a></p>\r\n\t<h6>California: Diminishing This Huge Deficit May Just Be a Dream</h6>\r\n\t<p>State
  deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $24.7 billion<br>\r\n\tPercent of general fund
  budget: 22.3%<br>\r\n\tState and local tax burden: 10.5%; Rank: 6</p>\r\n\t<p>California
  is facing the biggest budget deficit in the nation, yet \r\n\tvoters\u2019 willingness
  to chip in is starting to wane. Last month, they voted \r\n\tdown five ballot measures
  that included sales and income tax increases. Who \r\n\tcould blame them? At 11%,
  California has one of the worst unemployment rates \r\n\tin the country, the housing
  market has been decimated, and the state already \r\n\traised taxes on sales by
  1% to 8.25% and income by 0.25% (both of which \r\n\texpire in 2011). Gov. Arnold
  Schwarzenegger\u2019s latest budget plan includes \r\n\tsteep spending cuts across
  the government and cutbacks in social services.</p>\r\n\t<p>In a testament to California\u2019s
  grim predicament, one assemblyman\u2019s \r\n\tproposal to legalize marijuana for
  personal use and allow counties to tax it \r\n\tis gaining public support. It\u2019s
  one of the \u201Cwacky things you might be able \r\n\tto get away with now,\u201D
  says Rueben.</p>\r\n\t<h6>New York: If It\u2019s Bad for You, It Will Be Taxed</h6>\r\n\t<p>State
  deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $17.6 billion<br>\r\n\tPercent of general fund
  budget: 31.9%<br>\r\n\tState and local tax burden: 11.7%; Rank: 2</p>\r\n\t<p>New
  York State Gov. David Paterson may have been unsuccessful in levying \r\n\tan 18%
  tax on soda and other sugary drinks in the name of combating obesity, \r\n\tbut
  he\u2019s had a hand in raising taxes on plenty of other \u201Csinful\u201D items,
  \r\n\tincluding tobacco (up to 46% from 37%) and wine (up 58% per gallon, or about
  \r\n\ttwo cents more per bottle).</p>\r\n\t<p>For those living in New York, all
  those tax hikes can really add up. \r\n\tSecond only to New Jersey, New Yorkers
  bear the second-highest tax burden \r\n\tthanks to a high income-tax rate of 7.85%
  (for those earning more than \r\n\t$200,000). And property and gas taxes are among
  the highest in the nation, \r\n\taccording to the Tax Foundation. Nevertheless,
  shoppers can rejoice: The \r\n\tsales tax here remains relatively low at just 4%.</p>\r\n\t<h6>Florida:
  Driving and Smoking Will Cost You</h6>\r\n\t<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal
  2010: $6 billion<br>\r\n\tPercent of general fund budget: 27%<br>\r\n\tState and
  local tax burden: 7.4%; Rank: 47</p>\r\n\t<p>Florida passed its budget in May with
  a not-so-pleasant surprise for \r\n\tsmokers: a $1-per-pack hike (the first such
  increase in 19 years). Motorists \r\n\talso got hit with higher fees to renew a
  license or register a vehicle. It \r\n\tcould have been worse, though. Senate lawmakers
  had proposed eliminating the \r\n\tsales tax exemption on items like bottled water
  and tickets to sporting \r\n\tevents, both of which didn\u2019t make the cut.</p>\r\n\t<p>Still,
  residents here aren\u2019t feeling as much tax pain as some of their \r\n\tpeers
  in other states. Overall, Florida\u2019s tax burden is the third-lowest in \r\n\tthe
  nation and it\u2019s one of eight states that imposes no individual income \r\n\ttax,
  according to the Tax Foundation. But those perks may be outweighed by \r\n\tthe
  rest of Florida\u2019s economic situation. Home values are among the nation\u2019s
  \r\n\thardest hit and the state\u2019s $6 billion budget deficit could mean more
  tax \r\n\thikes are on the horizon.</p>\r\n\t<h6>Massachusetts: Shoppers and Couch
  Potatoes, Prepare to Pay Up</h6>\r\n\t<p>State deficit estimate for fiscal 2010:
  $3 billion<br>\r\n\tPercent of general fund budget: 11.2%<br>\r\n\tState and local
  tax burden: 9.5%; Rank: 23</p>\r\n\t<p>Just when Massachusetts was starting to shake
  its \u201CTaxachusetts\u201D nickname \r\n\t(it\u2019s ranked a middle-of-the-road
  23rd in the Tax Foundation\u2019s tax burden \r\n\tassessment), the state is preparing
  to hike taxes on everything from alcohol \r\n\tto satellite TV.</p>\r\n\t<p>The
  most hard-hitting for residents is a proposed increase in the sales \r\n\ttax to
  6.25% from 5%. Both the House and Senate approved the measure and \r\n\tit\u2019s
  looking likely the increase will pass by the July 1 deadline, says Noah \r\n\tBerger,
  executive director of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an \r\n\tindependent
  research group. Satellite TV subscribers may also get hit. The \r\n\tstate is proposing
  a 5% sales tax on satellite services. Providers, of \r\n\tcourse, are fighting the
  tax.</p>\r\n\t<h6>Arizona: Proposed Sales-Tax Hike Could Hurt Already-Strapped Residents</h6>\r\n\t<p>State
  deficit estimate for fiscal 2010: $3 billion<br>\r\n\tPercent of general fund budget:
  28.2%<br>\r\n\tState and local tax burden: 8.5%; Rank: 41</p>\r\n\t<p>The recession
  has thumped Arizona harder than most other states, says Lee \r\n\tMcPheters, research
  professor of economics at Arizona State University\u2019s W.P. \r\n\tCarey business
  school. The housing slump is partially to blame: During the \r\n\tboom, construction
  accounted for at least a quarter of new jobs created. \r\n\tSince home prices have
  fallen 43% from their peak, the construction industry \r\n\thas lost tens of thousands
  of jobs, says McPheters. Arizona\u2019s unemployment \r\n\trate in April was 7.7%,
  shy of the 8.9% national average.</p>\r\n\t<p>If Gov. Janice Brewer gets her way,
  residents will pay for the state\u2019s \r\n\tproblems by shelling out an extra
  1% at the cash register. The proposed \r\n\tsales-tax hike, which would bring the
  rate to 6.6%, was omitted from the \r\n\tbudget the legislature passed this month,
  but the governor may veto the \r\n\tbudget until it\u2019s put back in. (She could
  also place it on a November \r\n\tspecial election ballot.)</p>\r\n\t<h6>Nevada:
  What Happens in Vegas Is Going to Cost You More</h6>\r\n\t<p>State deficit estimate
  for fiscal 2010: $1.2 billion<br>\r\n\tPercent of general fund budget: 32%<br>\r\n\tState
  and local tax burden: 6.6%; Rank: 49</p>\r\n\t<p>Nevada\u2019s freewheeling, low-tax
  past is coming back to haunt it like a bad \r\n\thangover. The state levies no personal
  income tax and imposes some of the \r\n\tlowest taxes on businesses in the nation,
  says Bert Waisanen, a fiscal \r\n\tanalyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>\r\n\t<p>Nevada
  used to be able to afford being so generous with its residents. \r\n\tRevenue from
  tourism and gambling supported the state just fine. But now, as \r\n\tconsumers
  would rather put their coins in a bank account than a slot \r\n\tmachine, that revenue
  source is drying up. In fact, the state boasts the \r\n\tdubious honor of having
  the largest deficit in the country as a percentage \r\n\tof its budget \u2013 32%.
  It\u2019s hiked the sales tax by 0.35% to 6.85% and taxes on \r\n\thotel rooms are
  up 3%. It\u2019s even gambling with its business-friendly climate \r\n\tby raising
  taxes on businesses.</div>\r\n"
