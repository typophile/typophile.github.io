  I assume you all have to use Photoshop here and there... I'm wondering if someone
  who considers themselves very good with Photoshop could recommend a book? There
  are so many out there, so I'm hopeing for a recommendation from a person who's used
  it first hand and who is in the industry.\r\n\r\nMainly, I'd like to improve my
  color correcting, color matching, photo correction, and especially my selection
  processes. \r\n\r\nThanks for any and all advice."

    use the internet, if you have to have it written down search what you want online
    and print it off...\r\n\r\nThere are millions of PSD tuts on the net, you will
    find help in all the areas that you require. To be sure to improve most of these
    it just takes practice, and lots of it, just keep doing tutorial after tutorial.

    lots of books the name Katrina Eismann always stood out to me as someone who wrote
    technically superior instructions on professional photoshop skills."

  body: "hey melo\r\nI tend to recommend lynda.com since it take less time to learn
    and multiple instructors in a popular subject (photoshop, illustrator etc..).
    As for books you take some time look at amazon user ratings as they tend to be
    pretty accurate.    "
