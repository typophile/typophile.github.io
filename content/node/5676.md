    this</a> is the MyFonts sample &#40;smaller than the one I posted before&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I still think it is Stone Sans; the V and the R were modified though,
    and there&#39;s some tracking.'

  body: I didn&#39;t post this sooner, but I agreed with Eduardo&#39;s ID as Stone

    was the only font that was that close, in my opinion.
