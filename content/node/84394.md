body: I'm having trouble finding the font on the back of my peanut butter label. I
  have tried a few matching sites but they were not much help. I also think the text
  'nutrition information' is in another font again. Any feedback would help greatly.
  Thanks! O and the brand of peanut butter is ETA if that is any help.
