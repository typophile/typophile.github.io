  body: "The arrangement I created, detailed in this thread about [[http://typophile.com/node/97784#comment-529418|Font
    Family Naming in FontLab]] is organised according to the number field in FontLab,
    so that the weights/styles appear in the font menu with the lightest (Hairline)
    at the top and the heaviest (Black) at the bottom. The weights were given the
    following numbers in FontLab:\r\n\r\nHairline (& Oblique variant): 150\r\nThin
    (& Oblique variant): 250\r\nLight (& Oblique variant): 350\r\nRegular (& Oblique
    variant): 400\r\nSemibold (& Oblique variant): 500\r\nBold (& Oblique variant):
    600\r\nBlack (& Oblique variant): 700\r\n\r\nWhereas the others flow down the
    list with the normal version followed by the oblique variant, the Regular and
    Oblique combination are reversed as I did not name it \"RegularOblique\" but just
    \"Oblique\", which makes me think that this part of the naming conventions would
    be the second level of hierarchy for CS."

    that this factors into it but I have not experimented with this field in isolation."
