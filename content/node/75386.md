  Lab and DTL collaborating.]] I wonder what this means for the future plans on what
  FontLab itself is going to look. Eg. Will it encorporate UFO and other currently
  outside vendors? \r\n\r\n"

    It is notable I think that FL are only going to be selling OTMaster, and not any
    of the other DTL tools such as KernMaster. OTMaster is a table editing tool, something
    that has been missing from FontLab''s product line, but something that they are
    aware that people need. Over the years, I''ve used a number of tools that enabled
    direct editing of TTF/OTF tables, mostly for post-processing of fonts generated
    from FL or compiled from VOLT and/or VTT, or for copying tables between different
    fonts. I have to say that DTL OTMaster is the best of such tools, so this is a
    smart move on FontLab''s part: why expend development effort creating a table
    editor when someone else has already made such a good one.'

  body: "Indeed, we've entered a collaboration with DTL in such a way that they of
    course remain to be the vendor of the software, and in complete control over its
    development, and Fontlab Ltd. acts as a distributor. It's interesting, because
    this is the first time where fontlab.com actually sells non-FontLab software.
    \r\n\r\nDTL OTMaster was the obvious choice as the first product to offer, because
    it's quite self-contained (opens and saves OpenType fonts). So it does not directly
    fit into any *particular* tool workflow, but can be used with any workflow. \r\n\r\nThis
    does not mean that it's the only tool we'll be selling. We are interested in increasing
    interoperability between font editing applications, so I feel we'll need to do
    some work in order to achieve that. I for myself certainly would like to make
    sure that we're making tools available to the users that are easy to work with,
    and to mix with each other. \r\n\r\nI consider this the first step, not the only
    step. \r\n\r\nImporting and exporting UFO files is definitely planned for most
    if not all new versions of our apps. The more formats we support the better. "

    a few weeks back. What's 2.3 got that 2.00 doesn't? And is the upgrade path for
    this free? There was no word that an upgrade was imminent on DTL's site when I
    bought it.\r\n\r\nWho wrote the sales copy on FontLab's OTMaster page? I like
    it. It isn't the usual blah, blah, blah.\r\n\r\nrich"
