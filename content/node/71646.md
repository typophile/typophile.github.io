  body: Yes, but the font does have that flat part where they put the diamonds. The

  body: "Whenever I see very heavy, sort of 'generic-looking' serif fonts, I check
    the old FontBank collection, which was full of them. It's not exact, because of
    the 't', but <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/cache.htm\">Cache
    Extra Bold</a> might be close enough to work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Cheltenham</a>. Some sort of Cheltenham, anyway.

  body: You all are such a great group. Thanks for lightening it up. I know it has
    a bunch of stuff on it, but I was hoping. Cheltenham and Cache Extra Bold are
    great. Oh, thank you.
