  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As discussions in [[An Ideal Page: Line length, Leading, Margins, Page Size, Etc.]] and [[Cyrillic (Russian) ideal number of characters per line]] go, the topics discussed make absolutely no sense to me.  Discussing the “optimal number of characters on line” begs the question — it presumes that when one increases font size by a certain percentage, the optimal line length should increase by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the same<!-- raw HTML omitted --> percentage.  And I find this presumption silly.</p>
<p>But thinking about this more, the may be some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other<!-- raw HTML omitted --> power law governing the relation between the font size and line length.  Suppose one is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->required<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to prepare two copies of a book, one set in 10pt, another in 14pt; suppose that the choice of page size and layout is completely in your hands.  It is natural to assume that the larger-font variant will be designed to have somewhat larger page size.  Probably not by 40%, but definitely larger.</p>
<p>My question is: how much larger?  The increase in percents will determine the exponent of the power law: if the “desired” increase in size is 18%, it is ½-power; if 12%, ⅓-power etc.  (Was this question discussed before?  I can’t find any reference….)</p>
<p>I see one major complication: choosing a page size should depend on the expected position of the book when read.  People reading in chaise-long-position would react on a heavier book differently than people who prefer reading at a desk.  Is there any wisdom in addressing such differences?</p>
<p>——————————————————————————————</p>
<p>BTW, why I consider the rules like “1½ lowercase alphabet” ridiculous: a couple of thought experiments.  In XVIII century reform of Russian alphabet, 6 of 46 “duplicate” letters were removed.  Does it mean that the optimal length of line should have been decreased 15%?  In XX century reform of Russian alphabet, 3 of 36 excess letters were removed.  Does it mean that the optimal length of line should have been decreased 10%?</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, note that difference between these two reforms: the XX century reform removed the terminal hard sign Ъ.  This reduced the average length of a word (about 10%?).  And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted --> may have a chance of affecting the optimal line length (but here I consider line length in the case of a prescribed-in-advance font size!).</p>
<p>———————————————————————————————
To summarize: I think that discussion of optimal line length makes sense when one knows in advance the font size, and the expected reading pose.  It does not make sense without this knowledge.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Besides character per line, there is usually a recommended limit to line length (for normal reading within arm&rsquo;s length, about 7&quot;) to avoid excessive head turning when eye movement is not enough to encompass the line.

<p>It is not my opinion that some large-print editions use the same page size as normal editions; it is my experience—hence, it has been empirically verified in some instances. It is not uncommon that people who require larger type are somewhat old-school, and are used to reading newspaper and multi-column-formatted magazines. Such folks tend to eschew the whiplash encountered when trying to read very wide columns.</p>
<p>So, you can presume all you want: presumptions can be unwarranted, as well.</p>

<p>Duderabimus, if I need to repeat what I already said, here it is; all you are saying is that the answer may be 0.  Since I never said it could not, I do not see how what you say exposes any presumptions in my question.</p>

<p>The power of the reader, I think.</p>
<p>There are two directions and one place. The past was dedicated to the publisher&rsquo;s knowledge of their readers, the future is dedicated to the reader&rsquo;s abilities as granted by their choice of devices. The place is the present. If you are talking in the present about composition ideals of the past,  the publishers knew the laws. When you are talking in the present about composition ideals for the future, the laws start with the devices.</p>
<p>Another way of talking about this, is that the &ldquo;font size&rdquo; is not the parameter we look at when determining the optimal size-to-length relationship of text type, it&rsquo;s the x-ht.</p>

<p>Just in case: power law ≡ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->x ↦ xᵗ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (for a fixed value of t).  It is equivalent to saying that when x increases by k%, the result will increase by t·k % (for small values of k).</p>

<p>I intentionally used a vague term so that when answering, people have an opportunity to choose whatever measurement they consider relevant to the question.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> actually, what I had in mind in the original post was using the same font, just of different font sizes.  (My experience is only with optically scaled fonts; so I would prefer this assumed in the discussion.)</p>
