  that me and my partner made &#40; we have recently opened a studio &#41; this is
  a logo &#40;and also a cover &#41; of a cd of a singer here in israel. the cd is
  allready out, but i would be glad to hear your comments and critques for it. the
  image is built from hebrew letters &#40; font name: livorno&#41; and the name is
  built from a letter that we made here at the studio. it is interesting to see what
  u have to say about it &#40; as most of you dont read hebrew, i assume&#41;. thanx

  body: I always enjoy illustrations made of type. As for the logo, the characters
    look retro and techno at the same time. I think it&#39;s the thick and thin aspects,
    whether it&#39;s stroke modulation or counters vs stroke weight. Normally I would
    say the one that looks like a backward s is out of place &#40;because it has the
    only thin stroke&#41;, but it seems to be working with the other elements. What
    is the music like? I&#39;m guessing it has a little intensity to it.

    body: "thank u. sorry for my (too) late comment - yes the music is quite intense.
      the concept was - that he is a man of words - letters - more like a poet. \r\nafter
      few monthes that the album is out there, the comments are reguarding the readingness
      of the title - but as a unit the logo is very rememreble.\r\ni am guessing that
      i put this thread under the wrong subject (logos is more apropriate, i assume).
      anyway i have few new stuff to upload and be very glad to see your comments
      on it.\r\nthanx"
