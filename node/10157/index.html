		<div class="commentbody">Not only do I not like mandatory activation, I detest it! Ultimately, it makes things more difficult for me &#40;a paying user&#41; when rebuilding a hard disk upgrading a PC with a new hard disk. I&#39;ve had experience with the windows photoshop activation and its awful. Once I had to call adobe&#39;s activation line and the automated process kept rejecting the very long number I keyed in. I had to eventually wait for a CSR and get the activation key. That&#39;s time I will never get back, time I could have spent designing or choosing <i>my own</i> way to waste time. This does not deter piracy.</div>

The only relationship to the old Garamond Pro is that both are inspired by the types of Claude Garamond and designed by Robert Slimbach. Garamond Premier has a several-times-larger character set, and four completely independently designed optical sizes. Language coverage includes Greek, Cyrillic, extended Latin &#40;even Vietnamese&#41;, and there are small caps for all the supported languages. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Laura: Glad to be of help. <BR> <BR>DeWitt, <BR> <BR>I was going to say that you&#39;d have to wait for the next generation of technology after OpenType for that kind of capability. But then it occurred to me that OpenType&#39;s table structure and capacity to handle new, arbitrary tables in the future without harming existing functionality means that we could do this in OpenType 2.0. <BR> <BR>We just have to figure out how to put physical instantiation into a table. Also, the cost of arbitrary fabrication systems capable of building physical objects based on computer-based instructions needs to come down. But they only cost $20K today &#40;according to a recent piece in The Economist&#41;, so if we apply price reduction at rates equivalent to Moore&#39;s Law &#40;improbable, but just for fun&#41;... mmm, in about 13.5 years arbitrary fabs will cost about $40 so every computer will have one. Then you could just have a new OpenType table that contains instructions for building stuff, and have it build the thing that goes and gets your drink from the fridge. <BR> <BR>So, if you&#39;re willing to wait until late 2018, no problemo! <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, <BR> <BR>First, I believe that you&#39;re underestimating the exponential rate of growth of Moore&#39;s Law in today&#39;s ever-shrinking world of computer literates. Many institutions like MIT are spreading the technology to create such fonts into the nether regions of this tiny planet. And with nanotechnology--the line between analog and digital is being shredded faster than the hands of a drunk man feeding a wood. <BR> <BR>And that&#39;s not even factoring the close connection between font designers and programmers and their refrigerators. <BR> <BR>Heck, it took Adobe 22 years to make CS1 and about 1.5 years to pop out CS 2.

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;Bill, in 300 words or less, which errors are those? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a preview of an upcoming review: <BR> <BR>&#34;Let&#39;s see what optical kerning does to one of Adobe&#39;s own most recent state-of-the-art fonts, Adobe Garamond OT Pro. Consider the simple word &#39;jumps&#39; at 12 points. This word sets perfectly and doesn&#39;t require any kerning. It has been carefully optimized by Adobe&#39;s designer Robert Slimbach to have absolutely perfect spacing at this point size.  <BR> <BR>Now let&#39;s specify Adobe&#39;s &#39;optical&#39; kerning. InDesign subtracts 23 units of space between j and u, adds 14 units between u and m, subtracts 16 units between m and p, and -1 units between p and s. The result is atrocious. The u is now too close to j, and there is a noticeable river of space between u and m. A well-made font has been rendered useless. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s the same story no matter what font or setting you choose. Adobe&#39;s &#39;optical kerning&#39; isn&#39;t a feature -- it&#39;s a liability. Worse still, it&#39;s featured in Illustrator and Photoshop. <BR> <BR>Adobe has gambled that its target customers will not be able to tell the difference between a professional font rigorously spaced by its original designer, and a complete mess-up spaced by its guesstimator. I don&#39;t agree. My faith in designers is greater than that.&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Let&#39;s see what optical kerning does to one of <BR>&#62; Adobe&#39;s own most recent state-of-the-art fonts <BR> <BR>No, let&#39;s not, because everybody knows nothing can beat a really good human spacer. InDesign&#39;s optical spacing wasn&#39;t meant to be used only with Adobe&#39;s fonts, or Carter&#39;s fonts, it was meant to be <i>useful</i> to a lot of people, and most fonts most people use have imperfect spacing. Take Mrs Eaves for example, a font that many people love, to the point that they ignore the font&#39;s horrid spacing: InDesign renders Mrs Eaves actually usable. <BR> <BR>Anybody free of a visceral, burning desire to strike down Adobe at every turn in the berserker rage of a jilted lover &#40;think Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction&#41; can see that InDesign&#39;s optical spacing is just another tool, that can be used or misused. It is better than not having it, and that&#39;s more than can be said of many things, certainly most fonts! <BR> <BR>&#62; My faith in designers is greater than that. <BR> <BR>Faith, shmaith. Most fonts are spaced badly &#40;you of all people should realize and admit this&#41;, and InDesign&#39;s optical spacing makes them less bad, that&#39;s all. A good typographer simply knows when to use it and when not to. Think of it as anti-lock braking on a car: there are more people who need to avoid rear-ending the car in front of them than there are people who need to perform a controlled slide. <BR> <BR>Crocodile faith. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;I generally work with a font&#39;s built in kerning and then flip on the Optical Spacing for display work and fine tune from there. Often saves a lot of hassle. <BR> <BR>Well, Stephen, I suspect the reason you see a slight visual improvement is that the predominant action &#39;optical kerning&#39; takes is tightening. <BR> <BR>May I suggest that you simply track negatively instead? <BR> <BR>The problem with &#39;optical kerning&#39; is that it tightens disproportionately and incorrectly - and when it thinks it has to add space, the results are usually disastrous.  <BR> <BR>The advantage of using simple negative tracking is that you preserve the correct spatial relationships of the font. &#40;Unless it is just a shareware cockup - in which case, what are you doing using it to start with?&#41;  <BR> <BR>The profound disadvantage of &#39;optical kerning&#39; is that it distorts the original spatial relationships of the font in an irrational and unpredictable manner.  <BR> <BR>It requires only the simplest analysis of any of its suggestions to see where it almost invariably goes wrong. <BR> <BR>What is really great about the feature, though, is that it makes it so easy to determine exactly where and how it has gone wrong. <BR> <BR>My position is that it is simply indisputable that the traditional technique for dealing with display sizes - used since phototype - is the best: negative tracking. &#39;Optical kerning&#39; is a gimmick gone wrong. <BR> <BR>I know that deeply respected font folk from URW have worked on this intensively, but I believe their work has been in vain, primarily because the program still does not look at actual stems. Analyzing white space has been tried by a hundred programs a hundred times, and just doesn&#39;t work. Never has, never will. EvB and JvR tried doing this in a much more sophisticated manner, and ultimately conceded failure. The only thing that is surprising here is the number of worthies that were taken in on this latest occasion. <BR> <BR>There remains the suspicion that &#39;optical kerning&#39;, though of dubious merit for professional fonts, can be of value for badly spaced shareware fonts. I can&#39;t agree. If the program cannot understand a well-spaced font, it cannot understand a badly-spaced font. It seems clear that whatever slight benefit might exist is just due to generalized tightening that could be achieved better with simple tracking. <BR> <BR>I have yet to see a single documented test which establishes that &#39;optical kerning&#39; actually understands what it is doing.  <BR> <BR>But this isn&#39;t an issue which needs to be argued theoretically. Arguments for either side can easily be demonstrated by simply mentioning the settings. <BR> <BR>I have shown that &#39;optical kerning&#39; will hopelessly mangle the spacing of the word &#39;jumps&#39; in Adobe Garamond Pro. Can you provide us with some examples in which you can consistently show that &#39;optical kerning&#39; actually performs well? &#40;Especially when tested against simple negative tracking?&#41; My suspicion is that in at least 95% of cases, &#39;optical kerning&#39; will make visibly deleterious decisions. And my position is that no program can even begin to know how to space or kern until it is aware of actual stem positions. This, clearly, Kernus/URW/optical kerning cannot accomplish and indeed it is too much to expect, in a WYSYWIG context.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If the type designer knows what they are doing--and I think Stephen alluded to this--there is no reason to use Optical Kerning. However, in display instances, usually only a handful of words, starting with Optical Kerning is not a bad thing as, most likely, the designer is going to be hand-tweaking the type anyway. <BR> <BR>For instance, House Industries cannot do bad kerning. I think it is genetically impossible for them. For giggles I assigned Optical Kerning to some of their type and it goes to crap, seriously awful stuff. This proves to me--and I doubt very much--that Adobe intended Opt Ker to be used all of the time. It is a helpful tool but, like any tool, when used incorrectly can only cause the windows to be put in upside down.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; the predominant action &#39;optical kerning&#39; takes is tightening. <BR> <BR>Incorrect. The spacing is depending on point size, with smaller sizes generally getting <i>loosened</i>, which is of course what&#39;s required. I&#39;ve actually graphed the algorithm&#39;s behavior, and it&#39;s &#34;bilinear&#34;: a straight line between 4 and 12 point, another &#40;shallower&#41; straight line between 12 and 72, and no [further] change below 4 and above 72. <BR> <BR>That said, it&#39;s probable that <i>overall</i> InDesign&#39;s algorigthm tightens more than loosens, but I would think that&#39;s due to most fonts being spaced too loosely &#40;it&#39;s easier that way, after all&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; May I suggest that you simply track negatively instead? <BR> <BR>No, because that ignores &#34;boundary conditions&#34;, like the right side of the &#34;r&#34;. Fooling with the tracking is a brute-force approach that&#39;s generally much worse than what InDesign would do. <BR> <BR>One problem with InDesign&#39;s algorithm though: if you apply tracking to text that has optical spacing enabled, the tracking is still applied &#34;blindly&#34;, leading to the boundary issues above; I think it would have been much better to take the opportunity to apply the tracking adjustment as a &#34;recommendation&#34; to the optical algorithm to change its parameters. But maybe there are performance issues &#40;which is why I think the alogirthm is bilinear and not outright smooth&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; Unless it is just a shareware cockup <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a difference between a font with good forms but lousy spacing, and a font that&#39;s good in both. There are very many fonts in the former category &#40;probably because most people in type design are aesthetically competent but analytically lacking&#41; and these are the ones that benefit most from InDesign. <BR> <BR>&#62; Analyzing white space has been tried by a <BR>&#62; hundred programs a hundred times, and just <BR>&#62; doesn&#39;t work <BR> <BR>It hasn&#39;t been done to the point of matching a good human spacer, I agree, but it&#39;s really the only way you <i>could</i> get close to it! Balancing the white space, after all, is the whole point of this; stems are circumstancial, a shadow of the true solution. <BR> <BR>The reason it hasn&#39;t been done yet isn&#39;t that it&#39;s not possible, it&#39;s that there&#39;s not enough money in the field to finance a serious effort to completion. Many people who have given up wouldn&#39;t have if we paid them enough. But then we have people like Raph, so all is not lost. <BR> <BR>&#62; Can you provide us with some examples in which <BR>&#62; you can consistently show that &#39;optical kerning&#39;  <BR>&#62; actually performs well? <BR> <BR>You can easily do it yourself, like with Mrs Eaves &#40;which is no shareware font&#41;. And that way your denial has a chance -albeit a tiny one- of being cast off. If anybody else did it, you would simply fabricate deeper diversions. I know you Bill. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; My conclusion was that .... <BR> <BR>Tellingly, you were the only one to come to <BR>that conclusion, if I remember correctly. <BR> <BR>And is it a coincidence that you&#39;re also an Adobe-hater? <BR>Every opinion anybody presents has to be put in the broader context of what that individual wants from his life, has to be &#34;filtered&#34; to extract anything useful out of it, sometimes filtered quite heavily. <BR> <BR>About Bill for example, this hit me just yesterday: he&#39;s the &#34;Da Vinci Code&#34; of the type scene. Full of interesting rumors and insights, but a whole bound together with a self-centered, sensationalistic opportunism that can make him dangerously misleading. I guess you could say that Bill himself is a tool that&#39;s difficult to use well! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Some things &#40;like the extremely important &#34;the&#34;&#41; are much improved, but some places the decisions are suspect&#42;. That &#34;ru&#34; in the 12-optical for example makes me think that there&#39;s something to Nick&#39;s observation about a &#34;problem&#34; with serif fonts. Overall, an improvement I&#39;d say, but not as much as I expected. <BR> <BR>&#42; It&#39;s especially interesting to note the cases where the kerning decision is of <i>opposite</i> sign! <BR> <BR>Something else though: I think there&#39;s a problem with your rendering.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I printed this out, and it seems to make a little bit more sense. <BR> <BR>What I tried to do is count how many of the decisions seemed good and how many seemed bad. For the 72 point I got 10 good versus 4 bad; but for the 12 point &#40;which I actually observed on-screen, since my printer isn&#39;t good enough&#41; it was quite close: 6 good versus 5 bad. It&#39;s possible that the PDF suffers from the same type of problem as the previous GIF did, although I personally doubt it. Somebody with a 2400dpi printer might want to try it out and chime in... <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>One thing that hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet: from what I understand &#40;I think John pointed this out once&#41;, the Optical algorithm&#39;s decisions depend on the existing spacing; they don&#39;t completely over-ride it. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true, or why it&#39;s true, or how it might work, but it&#39;s possible that if a font&#39;s existing spacing is <i>really</i> whacked the algorithm doesn&#39;t perform as well? Or maybe if a font&#39;s spacing is unusually loose &#40;like in Mrs Eaves&#41; the algorithm gets confused? Dunno. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;how funny is that? <BR> <BR>It depends how you interpret &#34;spacing&#34;. Determining the width of the sidebearings is part of spacing, and so is adjusting serif shapes to accomodate the way glyphs fit. Kerning is a last resort. So, with a radical departure from the traditional rendering of baskerville, Licko had a lot of decisions to make along the lines of: <BR>&#34;These two characters are a bit far apart; shall I solve the problem by &#40;1&#41; changing the sidebearings, &#40;2&#41; changing the serifs, or &#40;3&#41; applying kerning?&#34;  And of course, one small change in one character pair will have ramifications elsewhere.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; It depends how you interpret &#34;spacing&#34;. <BR> <BR>Yeah, depending on how you interpret it in the context of your sales: if your users don&#39;t base their purchase decisions on spacing quality, you&#39;re set... It&#39;s really hard to say anything about Mrs Eaves&#39;s spacing other than it&#39;s really bad; and the kerning is quite hair-brained. Damn shame, since it&#39;s a font with superb black forms, especially in the italic. It&#39;s like a ravishing woman, with a speech impediment. <BR> <BR>BTW, Emigre was well aware of the valid spacing criticism against Mrs Eaves when they released the second version, but they sadly didn&#39;t take the opportunity to fix it. I understand that there&#39;s always the issue of maintaining linebreaks, but I wonder if there wasn&#39;t also a measure of hubris involved. <BR> <BR>&#62; Kerning is a last resort. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s over-simple. Although there is a hierarchy or sorts, at the highest level of type design, base spacing is in fact affected by the [eventual] kerning decisions. In fact, <i>letterform shape</i> is even affected by it. One big reason is this: the logic that a font has to work [very] well with kerning off is flawed; because people who use a font without its kerning aren&#39;t the type of people to worry about really good spacing in the first place. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Everything &#40;I hope&#41; I have to say about the Kernus/Indy fraud I have just said on the &#39;bouma of space craft&#39; thread, which I can&#39;t functionally tell apart from this one. Briefly, I think the testing proposed here so far is badly thought out. I have demonstrated that in any serif font, at 12 points, InDesign/Kernus will invariably subtract space from ju and add space to um. This is not acceptable behaviour.  <BR> <BR>But the conclusive proof is that for any serif font &#40;indeed, I think for any font at all, including ornaments&#41; InDesign will always alter the most fundamental spacing pair of any font: nnn.  <BR> <BR>This is not defensible behaviour on any grounds. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t believe that in the - what - five years? - so called experts have been yakking about this junk program, nobody has ever thought to make these most fundamental tests. I&#39;ve used the product for the first time for a few hours in the past week, and ... <BR> <BR>Folks - you&#39;ve been had. <BR> <BR>A PS for those who may not be aware of these fundamental facts: <BR> <BR>almost all text fonts are optimized for use at 12 fonts <BR> <BR>for all text fonts, the nnn spacing is the fundamental decision upon which all other spacing decisions depend <BR> <BR>for nearly all professional text fonts, nnn spacing is ideal at 12 points. <BR> <BR>Yet this is a fundamental characteristic which InDesign _never_ respects and _always_ tries to alter. This is a flaw that is hard wired and repeatably demonstrable.  <BR> <BR>I suppose I should have tried out a few hundred more fonts, instead of a dozen. But I knew this was going to happen anyway, and I&#39;ll leave that task to someone more determined to waste bandwidth. For me, Enough! La commedia e finito!</div>
