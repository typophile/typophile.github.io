  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, everyone. This is my fist posting to the forum. I've been reading this forum for a few weeks and have learned quite a bit from your critiques. Thanks! <BR> <BR>I am currently designing a logo for a progressive non-profit, for their new leadership-development program. they have already settled on the name, which refers to this resource network (of 4 parts)&hellip; unfortunately i couldn't talk them out of using &quot;matrix&quot; since that word has been killed. <BR> <BR>I am soliciting any feedback that you may offer, the more brutally honest the better. On this forum I have watched some pretty mediocre designs begin to sing after the valuable critiques provided by all of you. <BR> <BR>I'd love to hear which direction(s) have the most potential, and any ideas with integrating the &quot;matrix.&quot; Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20908.gif" alt="Some different avenues I&#39;ve been exploring..."></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Benjamin, Could you explain what the E stands for. The non-profit probably knows but I don't, and why a Matrix. A little more explaination will help. Do you have to use E or can you use a full word? Can you spell out 4? Are these the set colors or experiments? How are you going to use the logo, on-line, print?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From what little I know about this, and what you have presented, I like the direction of the last concept. The intersecting shapes have some strong potential, but it's very important to keep them legible. Let's see more exploration on that shape. The italicized &quot;matrix&quot; needs to go. If their market is corporate (especially execs), then &quot;matrix&quot; is an excellent word. The suits love to use matrix. I'll be watching.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have this inkling that there's a truly sublime solution for this waiting to be discovered&hellip; In the meantime, I think your rightmost one has the most potential: leadership is about being strong, inventive but also humane, so a semi-organic thing with a two firmly interlocking parts feels right. And if you make it angular* the idea of &quot;matrix&quot; might carry through, even though it's not a grid or something. <BR> <BR>* What about making one part angular (probably the &quot;4&quot;) and the other soft? <BR> <BR>And Scott is right about dumping that affected italic &quot;matrix&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">darrel, I would have to agree with. <BR> <BR>I also like Hrant's aforementioned fav.  I think that has some good potential. i would try having the bottom curve of the C angle upward slightly, and have the left arm of the 4 follow the same trajectory.  that would make that mark a little more serious.  maybe matrix off to the right.   <BR> <BR>the stuff on the 21st of november: <BR>I think it should be explored some more.  try cutting off some of the E by the 4. as if the 4 is up front.  this would help diffuse the read I am getting, &quot;metrix, or even meatrix&quot; <BR> <BR>obviously we all know why I am seeing meatrix ;)  but I am&hellip;. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">just to pick up on the point about people not noticing that the logo says e4, i dont really think this is a problem. I think that the shapes are such a strong form that even if people dont notice at first its a strong enough image to stick in peoples heads. Then when they notice that its an e and a four they will go 'oooo!' Quite afew TV companies in UK have logos like this and I dont think they suffer for it.  <BR>Perhaps you could even say e4 matrix under the logo or employ the idea above (see below). What I'm really tryin to say is that I hope you dont back away from this design becuase of an(imho) unjustified thought that people might not see what it says. I think its a great deign (Scotts rotation has really put the icing on the cake).  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21207.gif" alt=""> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21208.gif" alt=""></div>

The part about TV companies was just stating that I've seen some that use logos that you dont realize what they are for a while and thats ok, sorta trying to give Benjamin some confidence in what is a fantastic design.  <BR>re: the pixel font, I've not got the font that Benjamin's using to go under the logo so just used soem pixel font to show him what I ment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm sure someone will disagree with me, but I have to say there are no rules about placement. You should leave it open and call it situation dependant. For instance, You could even use the logo and the wordtype in two different places. With the letterhead, another for instance, the logo could be off to the side toward the top and the wordtype could be used with the address somehow. If you believe they should be used together, I would probably opt for one of those without the E4 &hellip; or &hellip; where the two E4s aren't right next to each other. I'm guilty of not following this entire thread, but I enjoy this solution. Edgy, clever &hellip; without being cute or over-the-top. I love the acid green too.

		<div class="commentbody">I think Mike's solution is perfect. Leave the <BR>mark, but add 'e4' to the name.

I do like the bold e4 and I agree from other comments that a lowercase e follows the logo better. (But I also like the closed-top 4 which doesn't follow the logo.) Whatever the two incarnations of e4 become in symbol and text, I'd suggest that they should resemble each others' typeface.  <BR> <BR>I realize with the top e it looks like the decision has been made for angular but my mind thinks round for lowercase e and square for uppercase. Here's my suggestion for an idea that may have been decided against long ago. Nevertheless, I think the e can be made round and more legible as lowercase without being playful.
