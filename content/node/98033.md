  fonts and I cannot remember what it was.  I recall it being a city or possibly a
  state and that it struck me as odd that it wasn't what I would generally think of
  as a western location.  I'm hung up on Michigan, but I don't know if there is any
  reason for that.  If anyone out there is more knowledgeable and can end my mental
  blockage, I sure would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks."
