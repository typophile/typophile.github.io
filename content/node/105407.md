  body: "Checked out <a href=\"http://search.veer.com/?keyword=phaeton&producttype=IMG,ILL,TYP\">
    Phaeton </a> & love the font:\r\nHere is an endorsement from ilovetypography.com:\r\n---start
    quote--\r\nPhaeton\r\nby Kevin Cornell & Randy Jones\r\nA brilliantly talented
    and prolific illustrator (& writer) hailing from Philadelphia, PA. Part super-hero,
    part \u2026 something else, you probably know him for his work at A List Apart,
    the Superest, or Mojo.\r\nLooking hand-drawn and with its trousers pulled up high,
    this condensed serif display face is oddly wonderful. Randy Jones was just the
    right chap to bring Cornell\u2019s lettering to digital fontdom. Wobbly cup serifs
    and a smattering of bouncy ball terminals combine to make this single cut a delightfully
    eccentric face that\u2019s really fun to use. It bears some of the hallmarks of
    Jones\u2019 Olduvai, and comes replete with numerous wordmarks and pictographs,
    plus a number of stylistic alternates. I wonder what Batman and Robin have up
    their other sleeves.\r\n--end quote--\r\nLink to<a href=\"http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Olduvai-Family-UMT0000054?skeywords=UMT0000054\">
