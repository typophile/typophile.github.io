<p>I finallly went into the ads on the page and found one that had used NuevaMM &ndash; and there was the culprit.</p>
<p>So I figure I&rsquo;d write to you and maybe save you some bald spots &ndash; and let you know that &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t nice to give a busy person an ad with an MM font in it&hellip; LOL</p>
<p>Happy to say, Photoshop has flattened the PDF - no one but you guys will know - and now I can get the work out to the printer. You think I&rsquo;m a little late? My September/October issue - which should be in folks hands right now &ndash; will be uploaded to the printer&hellip;</p>

<p>Also: &ldquo;Our testing also shows some significant problems with ATM (Light or Deluxe) on Vista; it&rsquo;s not just that we don&rsquo;t support it, but we actively recommend you not try running it on Vista. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being said, we realize that people have different expectations for fonts than other software, and we&rsquo;ve made an effort to help with the migration from MM fonts (and Type 1 fonts in general) to OpenType.

<p>&ldquo;Years ago, after Adobe discontinued sales of MM fonts, and before we discontinued support, we made a special heavy-discount offer for registered owners of those MM fonts for equivalent OpenType fonts. I think it was 50% off. However, this was back in 2003 or 2004, IIRC. There is no current free upgrade path, and the OpenType versions have considerable extra capabilities compared to the original versions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only Adobe MM font I ever had was Myriad. Now I have the Myriad Pro that came with CS. For my purposes it doesn&rsquo;t offer anything extra that the MM version did; in fact, I find it less capable because I liked to fine-tune weights and widths. I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to buy it even at 50% discount. I suupose I could generate MM instances I liked and generate them as separate fonts to use in OpenType format.</p>

<p>Yes, if you don&rsquo;t need Extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and OpenType capabilities, Myriad MM is probably enough.</p>

<p>And once it was altered those instances were available in the other Adobe CS1 programs.</p>
<p>At the same time they included Myriad Pro, Nueva Pro and Minion Pro (perhaps others) in the CS1 release to ease the pain of MM dying. Myriad Pro does it pretty proficiently but certainly Nueva Pro was a less substantial release.</p>
<p>At the time I was involved in a multi-year project that had Myriad MM specified for the identity. I was able to transition to Myriad Pro thanks to the free release of Myriad Pro with CS1. So thanks Adobe.</p>
<p>Although I do miss MM - it seemed like a very good idea at the time…</p>
