    (\u30EA\u30E5\u30A6\u30DF\u30F3), a Japanese font. I think the latin characters
    of Ryumin is derived from Century Old Style.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RyuminM_3685.jpg]"

  body: "Forgive me if I'm mixing things up, but shouldn't the one on top be a Didot
    rather than a Bodoni? I'm mostly looking at the unbracketed serif on the hairline
    stroke of \"A\", and the bowl of \"P\". Although the \"S\" does look like a Bodoni
    rather than Didot\u2026 it's a curious animal."

    Didot 16 Light</a> obviously isn't what they used, but seems to be a darn good
    match with the first typeface.\r\n\r\n"
