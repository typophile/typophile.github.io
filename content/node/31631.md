  (swashes, discretionary ligatures, ordinals, etc...) but is it possible to take
  it to far?\r\n\r\nFor me, when I use a pro font the first thing I want to do is
  turn on all of these features and restyle my text in all the available style sets,
  etc...\r\n\r\nSo the question I guess I have is if it's ever a bad thing to use
  all of these features. I know there is the right tool for the right job - but I
  guess I don't know when it's appropriate to use them all. An example would be, is
  it right to set all my text with discretionary ligatures?\r\n\r\nI need some advice
  :)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

  body: Depends on the piece. It could be thought of like color. For some projects
    lots of psychedelic colors are appropriate, but for others simple black and white
    is right.

  body: "Along Stewf's lines, think of opentype features as a toolbox. Some jobs require
    a few tools, some many. When you take your toolbox to work, you don't know which
    you will need so you pack the whole kit to be prepared for all situations.\r\nA
    type designer might pack his opentype font toolkit with lots of features just
    to have them available for whatever job is needed. The craftsman who uses the
    tools should be skilled enough to use them wisely.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "So, to sum up, the simple answer is \"yes\" it is possible to take things
    too far (at least, on most jobs).\r\n\r\nDiscretionary ligatures are off by default
    because they would be inappropriate in most jobs.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I'm curious if there is some kind of tax on the system when using extra features?
    Meaning, does the possibility of "bad record index"-type errors increase or can
    it cause InDesign/Quark to freak out or get sluggish?

  body: Mike, in addition to what has been said, try think of OpenType options as
    tools. A great craftsman would look very silly using ten tools at once. What is
    important is knowing when to use your tools, and how to best utilize them.

  body: "\"What a useless designer you are! Build it yourself.\"\r\nThese words are
    still ringing in my ears as I was used to hear them from my supervisor, Egyptian
    Professor, Mohammed Moneer Shaker (May God has mercy on him) whenever I complained
    with the unavailability of certain electronic components to complete building
    my final-year communication project. \r\n\r\nThe most creative is the one who
    makes the most out of the least tools?\r\nSo, the more creative you are, the farther
    you can take it.\r\n\r\nHappy Designing"
