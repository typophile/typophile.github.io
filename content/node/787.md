    Where did it come from? What does it mean? Is there something better? &#62; &#62;
    I tried googling the sucker, w/ no joy. A search here in Typophile &#62; produced
    nothing. But even FontLab has it as a default selection... &#62; &#62; I ask because
    I was planning on using it in a demonstration, &amp; I&#39;m &#62; sure the question
    will come up. &#62; &#62; Thx. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re asking where the word Hamburgevons
    came from, it&#39;s not a real word. Historically, those letterforms exhibit the
    principle characteristics of a given typeface. So it&#39;s a quick way to get
    an idea of what the entire font looks like. Sometimes seen as Hamburgefons, you
    can also set a pailndrome sentence, such as &#34;Frowzy things plumb vex&#39;d
    Jack Quadrat!&#34;. <BR> <BR>Tony'

    the way. Hilarious. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;re Hamburgefonts, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Linotype,
    I know, was using it by 1978 or 1980. I saw it used there in their letter drawing
    office, and they got me to use it in the planning of my TF Bryn Mawr series. <BR>
    <BR>I never asked them, but might Linotype have started using it via Mr. Frutiger
    or Mr. Zapf? <BR> <BR>Ruari McLean&#39;s excellent 1980 &#39;The Thames and Hudson
    Manual of Typography&#39; shows just the phrase &#39;Hamburg&#39; being used in
    some Monotype Plantin showings on p. 78. <BR> <BR>That might have helped spur
    its popular use along. <BR> <BR>The idea with &#39;Hamburgefonts&#39; and &#39;HAMBURGEFONTS&#39;
    &#40;as I first saw it used at Linotype and about the same time, printed in the
    pages of ITC&#39;s wonderful old &#39;U&amp;lc&#39; printed publication&#41;,
    and later &#39;Hamburgefonstiv&#39; and &#39;HAMBURGEFONSTIV&#39; &#40;as it was
    later first expanded on in print, elsewhere&#41; was that if you started defining
    a new typeface concept with those letters, that by the time you were through,
    you&#39;d have all tested all the shapes and intercharacter relationships &#40;providing
    sidebearings&#41; for what you&#39;d need to define pretty much throughout the
    rest of the font. <BR> <BR>ITC started showing it in their publication &#39;U&amp;lc&#39;
    in ads announcing to budding designers how to submit new typeface ideas to them.
    Basically, they &#40;as I recall&#41; just wanted to first see &#39;Hamburgefonts&#39;
    and &#39;HAMBURGEFONTS&#39;. <BR> <BR>I agree that it likely came from Linotype
    or perhaps the old URW &#40;while they were digitizing ITC typefaces on contract&#41;.
    Linotype was using URW&#39;s &#40;Dr. Karow&#39;s&#41; IKARUS minicomputer-based
    &#40;not desktop yet&#41; digitizing system then.  <BR> <BR>Or, perhaps from the
    old iteration of H. Berthold AG &#40;based in Berlin&#41;.  <BR> <BR>H. Berthold
    AG&#39;s positively exquisite &#39;E2, Berthold Fototypes, Body Types, Volume
    1&#39; &#40;February 1980&#41;, on p. LXVIII, uses &#39;Hamburgefons&#39;. &#40;Actually
    the whole line was displayed as &#39;H  Hxkp'
