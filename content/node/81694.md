    only purpose is to further indulge our need for longing for things, opportunities,
    and lifestyles we cannot achieve, I am fairly sure you can buy it somewhere.  Frankly
    the wedding itself isn't what people are tuning in for, I think the majority of
    us don't really give a hoot about it.  Only reason why most people tune in is
    to see how the wealthy spend their money on ridiculous.  The best part is, British
    civilians will be picking up part of the price tag, apparently $33 million is
    a bit steep for the Windsor family.\r\n\r\nAnyways, to the topic at hand, that
    is quite a lovely booklet they got.  I must agree with the \"at\" comment, it
    does a look exiled from the rest, maybe it's the village idiot of the group?"

    is the main reason people (mainly women, according to one poll I saw) have a fascination
    with the royal wedding is the fantasy element. Royal weddings have been the subject
    of numerous myths, stories and movies. It's the fantasy of marrying a prince and
    having an amazing wedding and living happily every after.\r\n\r\nPlus just the
    spectacle of it. People like a good show."

    the words \"Official Programme\" were instead set in two different sizes of normal
    capital letters.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think one needs to be \"really picky\" to
    find that unfortunate.\r\n\r\nPlacing \"at\" on a line by itself, so that the
    names of the bride and groom can be on one line, and the name of the place can
    be on another line, seems quite reasonable to me for a document of this nature
    - a title page, at least, can legitimately have something of the category of an
    invitation card.\r\n\r\nWhat was the custom in olden times was that if Mary Jones
    married John Smith, she would still be addressed as \"Mary\" by her friends, but
    if she were addressed <em>formally</em>, she would be called \"Mrs. John Smith\",
    to indicate that she is the wife of John Smith - and, in fact, the form \"Mrs.
    Mary Smith\" would be improper, used only in the case of a divorced woman. (Referring
    to her less formally as \"Mary Smith\", however, was proper even then.)"

    think genuine small capitals are more in the category of things that one <em>ought</em>
    to be concerned about, even if many people are not these days, and so one could
    get away with cutting corners.\r\n\r\nHowever, until such time as small capitals
    are supported in a standard manner by the operating system itself - as opposed
    to being supported only in more expensive applications programs - I think it is
    still legitimate to exclude them from basic font packages. The criterion which
    I see as applicable is not concerned with the <em>intrinsic</em> importance of
    small capitals, but the simple fact that only professional users would actually
    be able to make use of them <em>if provided</em>, and so given this... environmental...
    circumstance, it's legitimate to make them one more item only included in the
    \"professional\" version of the font with its professional pricing.\r\n\r\nWhen,
    as, and if, Windows gets fixed so that small capitals are at least as easy to
    access as bold and italic from within <em>WordPad</em>, and any rich text control
    that might appear in an application or on a web page, <em>then</em> a regular
    font that doesn't come with small capitals would look silly. That day has not
    yet come."
