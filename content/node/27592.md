  \r\n\r\nI saw a copy of Arena in the UK with Beyonce on the cover that was good,
  and going back a few months Wired used a nice one on the cover.\r\n\r\nIt's to be
  used alongside Helvetica Neue for names of interviewees in a sports magazine.\r\n\r\nAny
  help very much appreciated as always.\r\n\r\n"

    Sarah Pro</a> is a beautiful handwriting face. Not sure about using it in a sports
    magazine, though. What sort of feel are you thinking of?

  body: Perhaps the magazine should get the interviewees to hand-write their own names
    for each interview.
