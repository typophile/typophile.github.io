  body: Jim, the last building letters sent me three posters and nothing else. I want
    a &#34;anual report on whats realy going on there&#34; I don&#39;t care about
    fonts, I care about people. So lets get down to facts what has been done in the
    last year. It&#39;s nice people like to get involved, but I have to know there
    are results.

  body: Dan <BR> <BR>Firstly, just to clarify, your pack only contained the posters,
    no magazine or disk? If so, thats not right! <BR> <BR>On an annual report. Yep
    we have all that in the next pack and it will be on the new website which will
    be uploaded in the next week. One of my friends went over to check things out
    a few weeks back and he has pictures and a report of where we are at. <BR> <BR>JIM

  body: The Building Letters project is a great idea, I thought it was a one-off,
    but continuing the project is cool.

  body: I think two is probably the limit of it, as I can only ask people to donate
    so much of there time. Maybe after this issue it will rest for a few years and
    come back, or the project may take on a different form.  <BR> <BR>JIM <BR>===
