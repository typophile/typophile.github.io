    possible that they added a stroke to the |K| from Erbar Condensed or altered the
    Condensed Bold |K| (the other letters are a dead-on match).\r\n"

  body: "You're right. Completely missed that one. Funny thing is Bold lowercase /k
    has diagonal strokes meeting at the vertical but uppercase in a 'T'. And that's
    the opposite with Light weight: /k in a 'T' and /K at the vertical.\r\nPart of
    that, that looks too close to Erbar Condensed not to be it."
