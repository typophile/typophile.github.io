  body: hmm... i've looked everywhere. can't find it. such a beautiful font though.
    all prim and proper. closest i could find was adana. other alternatives might
    be Savoye, Viant, Pluma, Florentine Cursive, Liberty, and Bernhard Tango. Best
    Wishes!

    did you get the sample?

    so much for trying to help. I believe I found this example in  Martha Stewart
    a few years ago. I know that Jonathan and Tobias designed a lot of custom fonts
    for Martha and I wonder if they did not create this one. I will contact them and
    see what they say. It does seem so familiar, but I've not been able to figure
    it out either.\r\n\r\nI'll keep coming back, hope to find a definite answer.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMara"
