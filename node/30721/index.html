  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello! Thank you for reading this post.</p>
<p>I have heard plenty of opinions on what font editing software is most effective, most professionally utilized, price comparisons, easy to use or learn and other things that distinguish one program from the next.</p>
<p>But what should a good font design program actually offer? If you ignore the name, the price, even perhaps ease of use of any given program on the market: What should the program have?</p>
<p>Please list the options, the price points and such.  I am curious as to what functionality of a program makes it superior to the next.  Please answer this as if you were addressing the average computer user (not a typography expert like yourself, you smart devil).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting question, but seems a little bit pointless? You basically have four options if you want to use font editing/creation software that&rsquo;s being actively developed&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Commercial product</li>
<li>Cut down cheaper version of commercial product</li>
<li>Open Source product</li>
<li>Cheap &lsquo;shareware&rsquo; product by nice bloke in Holland</li>
</ol>
<p>Conveniently it really just comes down to price and philosophy - something for everyone.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Si!- I have read many of your other answers in this forum, I am learning a lot from you. Which I owe you many thanks. Keep up the great posts!</p>
<p>Now to business.</p>
<p>Very true what you said.</p>
<p>But what I am hearing is mostly personal preferrence with no actual information backing it. When a person is trying to learn what makes things tick, its difficult to understand the mechanicks when people say &ldquo;This one is great, this is what you need&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One person said they absolutely love Type Tool.
Many say Fontlab because it is the standard.
Fierce brand loyalists are behind Fontographer.
And others like the stuff they find on shareware sites.</p>
<p>Why?  Is it because one is updated more often? Because one is only in their price range? Because they were originally trained on it and don&rsquo;t want to change? Or is Fontlab truly mind blowing etc.</p>
<p>The question is not pointless if one wants to go deeper than merely brand or price. What makes a program tick?</p>
<p>I watched a lot of hype over products and brands in college. What a better place to learn from the experts asking you guys!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry, your question wasn&rsquo;t really pointless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure other people will give your more helpful answers - the point was really that in this space you&rsquo;re not exactly spoilt for choice.</p>
<p>The answer also depends on what you want to make, and what you want to learn. If you&rsquo;re just interested in making a few basic fonts then FCP or Typetool may be totally fine - if you&rsquo;re looking to make OpenType fonts then making the jump straight to FontLab may be a better bet. With respect to FOG, although people still love it, and many designer still use it to start a design, I think all the signs point to FontLab not investing in it long-term.</p>
<p>Cheers, Si</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From the question, I surmise you have not done a course. As a poorly self taught person, my answer would be as follows</p>
<p>Everyone works in a different way, and as such should use the program which that person finds easiest to use, and understand. Fontographer to me is easiest to create with, but Fontlab is best for me to do the finicky fine work with. So I use both. Other more professional people would, in general, suggest you use Fontlab, as they know all the ins and outs through training and experience. 
So what you need to do is try the programs and determine which is easiest for you to get the desired outcome.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you have a lot of money and are doing full-time font development, particularly in a team setting, there&rsquo;s also DTL FontMaster.</p>
<p>But for most other folks doing serious work, if you are only buying one tool, FontLab is the only option worth considering.</p>
<p>Fontographer simply lacks key features that we need for serious work (such as OpenType support, decent Unicode support, native TrueType editing, adequate hinting for both kinds of outlines, and a zillion aspects of control over what goes into the generated font). It does have a drawing interface that a lot of people like, however.</p>

<p>Thomas (as well as the rest of you)you hit it on the nose! 
&ldquo;Fontographer simply lacks key features that we need for serious work (such as OpenType support, decent Unicode support, native TrueType editing, adequate hinting for both kinds of outlines, and a zillion aspects of control over what goes into the generated font). It does have a drawing interface that a lot of people like, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the info I was really looking for. Thats the cold hard stuff that tells me what to look at.</p>
<p>I have a B.A. in art from a fabulous and prestigious liberal arts college&hellip;.It just so happens that it wasn&rsquo;t so fab in the art department though. There were no Typography courses and such- my design classes didn&rsquo;t even get into it. But discussing the various avenues of formal art and design education is not what this post is for. What&rsquo;s done is done and I am working hard now. The point is moot and I am happy with it all- just doign a little overtime in the self education thing right now.</p>
<p>I am an Adobe addict so I comprehend when people say that a program has a tough learning curve. I also understand budget concerns and hobbyists vs. professionals.</p>
<p>I want to get into font design (I drool over them honestly&hellip;). I don&rsquo;t have the budget right now to invest in Fontlab but I am going to be designing three logos in the comming weeks and thusly I am beefing up my knowledge on everything I can.</p>
<p>I understand when some will surely say &ldquo;If you are serious about this you will find a way to purchase Fontlab&hellip;&rdquo;. I agree with them. Unfortunately, my bank account doesn&rsquo;t and that is the reality that I have to face.</p>
<p>So in the mean time, I want to learn about the options and see what makes them tick.</p>
<p>So what it comes down to is this. Fontlab is worth it- but I can&rsquo;t afford it right now. So can I do everything that I will need to do (and learn mind you&hellip;newbie newbie at font work) on Type Tool? Can I save the font in all the formats I need to?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what to ask&hellip;get the picture? I am in that land of I know enough to know I don&rsquo;t know anything. Which is a good thing, since I am here putting forth effort. :)</p>
