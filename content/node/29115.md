  body: "Whats the point of using a free software which generally don't have that
    much tools. U can use demo version of FontLab..the only thing that you can't do
    with the demo is save files.But I'm assuming that you need it for learning purpose.
    Because if you design type..you should atleast have an original copy of fontlab.(FontLab
    is the best available in the market)\r\n"
