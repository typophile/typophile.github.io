body: box for used lead type. specifically, unsorted used lead type. "hell" being
  the operative term, because distributing this type back into cases was a hellish
  job, one often left to the typesetter's young assistant or apprentice, also known
  as a printer's devil. it is unknown whether these two diabolical terms appeared
  first in tandem.
