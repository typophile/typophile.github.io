body: "Given the table below, one can see that the only noticeable difference in the
  glyphs, is the one between the character U+FBE5 and the characters U+FBE4 and U+0620.
  For the other characters the glyphs from the Arial font are identical. One other
  thing that called my attention was the fact that indeed the Arial font considers
  the character pairs (FBE4, 06D0), (FBE2, 06C9) and (FBD7, 06C7) equivalent, as they
  have the same GlyphID's.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unicode Arabic

      the characters in the range U+FB50-FDFD, I can see the reference \"Preferred
      characters are found in the Arabic 0600-06FF\". But I couldn't find in this
      last block, the characters for the final forms."

    body: Thanks for the link. Very informative indeed. But I'm a newbie on fonts,
      and more so with Arabic characters. The answer to the very first question in
      the link you provided states the following "Arabic font designers should do
      whatever is necessary to add the full range of glyph support to the fonts they
      develop". Can I interpret this as the answer to my last question ?

  body: "Belloc, the background here is that in order to encode Arabic text you only
    need one character code per letter, but that in order to display Arabic text you
    need multiple glyphs per letter. Before smart glyph processing technologies like
    ACE and OpenType, some styles of Arabic text could be adequately displayed by
    performing character-level substitutions of presentation form characters (initial,
    medial and/or final, plus ligature presentation forms), so Unicode encoded a set
    of these for compatibility with such systems. Some fonts contain mappings for
    presentation forms even though they also contain e.g. OpenType Layout tables and
    are not expected to used the presentation form characters during display. This
    is done for backwards compatibility only, so that older documents can be displayed
    in those fonts.\r\n\r\nThe other phenomenon that you will likely notice is that
    some of the characters in the Arabic range (0600) appear to be identical if you
    only look at the default encoded glyphs or at the Unicode glyph charts. This is
    because there are letters in various Arabic-script orthographies that take identical
    isolated forms but that have different joining behaviour and/or take different
    forms in initial, medial or final positions. Unicode made the decision to separately
    encode such characters, rather than relying on language-specific glyph processing
    to ensure correct display. [This topic can be especially confusing for newbies,
    because the differential behaviour of some letters is derived from different styles
    of the Arabic script, so in some fonts the difference will disappear. For example,
    the character \u06BE (<em>do chashm\u012B he</em>) is a letter in the Urdu alphabet
    that is differentiated in Unicode from the Arabic <em>h\u0101\u2019</em> because
    in some common styles of type it takes different forms in different positions.
    But the <em>do chashm\u012B he</em> originated as the standard form of <em>h\u0101\u2019</em>
    in the  Persian <em>nastaliq</em> style (which is the normative style for Urdu),
    and in a <em>nastaliq</em> font one would expect both the Arabic and Urdu letters
    to behave identically. Confusing?]"

      your generosity in sharing with me (and the others who read theses posts) your
      deepest knowledge about fonts in general and Arabic characters in particular.
      I'm very grateful to your help, for you always give me more than I ask for,
      and this not only strengthens the respect I already have for you as a professional,
      but also as a person.\r\n\r\nAs always, your explanation was superb. The last
      part wasn't totally clear to me. But that really doesn't matter, for I know
      I'll be able to return here later, if necessary.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n"
