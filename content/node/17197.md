  & Frere-Jones website http://typography.com/ in the section that reads \"What's
  New: From a crisp family of display faces to the four grades of text face engineered
  and tested for the demanding environment of newspaper printing, Mercury is a type
  family designed to meet the needs of the most exacting typographer. Its sixty-nine
  styles include all the trimmings, right down to 74 symbols designed to thrive at
  small sizes\"? I don't think it is Mercury (is it Georgia?).\r\nThanks "
