  body: If you mean the name Giorgio Armani, this is custom drawn.

  body: If you just want something similar, you could use almost any Bodoni and add
    a spur to the G and be very close.

  body: another suggestion might be to use Didot from Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones. Didot-HTF-M06-Medium
    to be closer.

  body: that depends on the top of the lowercase t. is it scooped, angled or flat?

  body: Looks more like Didot than Bodoni - the G already has the spur and the shapes
    of the s and R in the sample are closer to Didot. <BR> <BR>Specifically, have
    a look at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/italian-didot/" target="_blank">Italian
    Didot</a>

  body: In college I used to work at Armani Exchange, and I remember seeing a style
    guide saying that the Armani logo font was Bauer Bodoni manually condensed. I
    don't remember the actual percentage condensed. But that damn spur on the G must
    have been customized. Also, I saw this style guide back in 1993, and I believe
    the switched to a Didot face a few years ago, especially since Fabien Baron (ex
    Harpers Bazaar art director and Didot fan) does a lot of graphics work for them.
    My personal belief is that they now use a customized version of Didot for the
    logo and HTF Didot for their sub-brand names, like "armani mania" perfume, which
    you can tell by looking at the lowercase a.
