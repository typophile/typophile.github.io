  of poster with any of the above words came up empty. Long story short, I have a
  couple of posters I'd like to display. They weren't terribly expensive, though one
  or two are limited printings, and in general I'd prefer not to do anything permanent
  to them (i.e. mount to foamcore, etc.). One of them is printed edge-to-edge, making
  framing a bit difficult. I'd rather not pay to have them professionally framed,
  as this would cost orders of magnitude more than they cost. My current favorite
  idea is to place them between sheets of lexan or glass and use binder clips to hold
  the sandwich together. My main concern with this is moisture, if the posters absorb
  too much they could end up sticking to the glass. You guys must have posters, any
  interesting methods for their display? One neat idea I came across was magnetic
  paint, paint a section of wall with it and use magnets to hold the posters up, but
  I'm unsure. Any ideas, suggestions, assuagements would be greatly helpful.\r\nThanks!"
