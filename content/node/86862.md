  body: "This is a rather strange combination of glyphs... \r\nThis specific /R/ ir
    rather strange by itself - can't find any similar; and the combination of M/G/S/W/J
    doesn't seem to co-exist in a single font.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only suggestion
    I have is to reconstruct it using different fonts.\r\nYou can use the B/O/R/E/Y/T/I/N/G/L/
    of <strong>Alternate-Gothic No 2<strong>\r\n\r\nthe /M/W/ of  <strong>Letter Gothic
    L Bold</strong>\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/letter-gothic/\r\n\r\nand
    the /J/S/ of <strong>Qhytsdakx</strong> (a bit condensed).\r\nhttp://www.eaglefonts.com/qhytsdakx-ttf-166952.htm\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if this helps...\r\nbut it's my best suggestion"
