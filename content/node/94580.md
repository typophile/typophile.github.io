body: "I am working on a label and the name of the product is set in Impact 20pt,
  80% horizontal, 100% vertical. This is visually perfect, of source I wish I could
  use a narrow font instead of the 80% scaling but my main problem is that the label
  would be even better if the product name was set in a serif font.\r\n\r\nSo I am
  looking for suggestion for a <cite>serif font</cite> that has similar weight, proportions
  and visual impact as Impact. Any ideas?"

    I think Cyrus Highsmith is spearheading the development. Nick Sherman would know
    the status. They\u2019re conceived as a short-term solution for what is hopefully
    a temporary problem. (Don\u2019t know if they\u2019d survive being additionally
    scaled to 80%; they barely survive the adaptation to Impact\u2019s metrics.)\r\n\r\n"
