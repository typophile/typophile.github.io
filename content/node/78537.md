  an assessor or supervisor views, reads, relates and marks etc a written text. \r\nThis
  fascinates me as there may be considerable differences in the humanities and sciences.
  And in the sciences, between the soft and hard sciences something like psychology
  or economics may need a different font for top appeal and presentation to something
  like physics or mathematics to be as convincing as possible. Then there are the
  health sciences and nursing where maybe\r\nempathy and other centeredness and practicality
  a certain organic life centredness is valued more than in say philosophy or theosophy
  where self consciousness is written in capital letters. I would like to get input
  and views from others on this? \r\n"

  body: Your basic premise may have some merit, but I doubt that there's any way to
    predict any one individual's predilections or preferences in advance, such that
    your type choice would inure to your benefit. Perhaps the question would be better
    asked in a Neuro-linguistic Programming forum...

    If they don't like you, they'll find a way to dismiss most any font choice."

    if the font choice would make much of a difference in grading, as long as the
    font was not wildly inappropriate and the layout was reasonably easy to read.\r\n\r\nHowever
    if there is a professional publication that your teacher/supervisor reads and
    respects, perhaps using similar font & layout choices might be an approach you
    could try.\r\n"
