  (8 k)</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-/Attachment-!> <BR> <BR>Hi. Here is another face
  I&#39;ve been playing around with. I am experimenting a little bit with process
  here. I think to be good one has to master the medium &#40;or at least learn to
  work with it&#41;. For ex. while the stone has a lot to do with what the letters
  on the trajan column look like, the masons were in control of what was going on.
  My medium, in this case the bezier curve, often masters me. &#40;how many clunky
  s&#39;s do we need to do before we can get it right?&#41; That being the case, I
  decided to do a face without using any geometric crutches &#40;circles, squares,
  etc.&#41; or duplicating any parts of letters. It&#39;s still a sketch right now,
  and is just a lineale &#40;sp?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some of the letters are still pretty
  lumpy. I&#39;m trying to decide where the roughness is working and where I need
  to apply a little more polish. I&#39;m torn on the Q. It could be really cool or
  completely off. &#40;it could be a bit less lop sided for sure, but is the tounge
  working or not?&#41;.'

  body: ' Christian, <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t let this one sit on the shelf like all your  <BR>other
    beauties that taunted us once and we never <BR>see again. <BR> <BR>There is great
    potential here. The replication of  <BR>glyph parts has been done. Adding a human,
    <BR>organic, hand drawn touch to a text font isn&#39;t  <BR>often done - and when
    it is done, it rarely works.  <BR>When it works, it&#39;s usually a design based
    in  <BR>calligraphy &#40;Zapf&#41; or brush forms. <BR> <BR>Beezer is something
    new. It reveals clearly the use <BR>of computer-based tools, but the human touch
    is still <BR>evident. I&#39;m interested to see how the quirks affect  <BR>the
    font at small sizes &#40;Flash doesn&#39;t exactly allow a  <BR>good view of tiny
    type&#41;. I&#39;d also love to see more of  <BR>the Brush style. <BR> <BR>My
    favorite glyphs: &#34;a&#34;,&#34;g&#34;,&#34;l&#34; <BR>Glyphs that make me extra
    glad: &#34;a&#34;,&#34;g&#34; of Bold Study <BR>The glyph that makes me sad &#40;and
    might benefit  <BR>from a more conservative approach&#41;: &#34;G&#34; <BR> <BR>I
    think those letters with more gradual curves work  <BR>best. The sudden kinks
    of the &#34;G&#34;, &#34;K&#34; &#34;R&#34; and &#34;Q&#34;  <BR>&#40;oops, was
    I supposed to ignore that?&#41; are  <BR>distracting and mar an otherwise clean
    design. <BR> <BR>Focusing on gentle curves still leaves room for your  <BR>hand-massaged
    expirimentation and I think it works  <BR>great on those glyphs I mentioned. <BR>
    <BR>Noting the method and the preview sample, I predict  <BR>the Bold style will
    be the star of this family. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' Wow, something really new. Many many others have tried to introduce/adopt
    such iconoclasm in type design, but 99% have failed. <BR> <BR>Christian, I think
    you&#39;re really onto something here. Those sporadic but tempered quirks in an
    otherwise docile <BR>design really work, to my surprise. Maybe put a spin on the
    UC &#34;Y&#34; as well? But it would have to be non-calligraphic. <BR> <BR>It
    seems to me that the biggest difficulty in such  an unorthodox design is to avoid
    over-rationalization, and trust your instincts. But at the same time don&#39;t
    fall into the &#34;artiste&#34; trap that renders a font unusable. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    go all the way with this! <BR> <BR>hhp '

    add some character, though. I might try making the curves a little more subtle.
    It all started with the lc f, who&#39;s shoulder ended up a straight line &#40;a
    happy accident&#41;. I wanted to apply that same feeling to some other characters,
    hence the lc a, the uc G and even the Q &#40;which has grown on me over the past
    few hours, though it will definitely be refined&#41;. <BR> <BR>Oh, I thought I&#39;d

    I took three of my preferred sans serif typefaces, namely Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk,

    him about this and he mentioned that while it worked for this particular specimen,
