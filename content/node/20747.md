    in \"EBERT\". You could do much worse than <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.365.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=FRIEDRICH+EBERT+GYMNASIUM&sampleSize=48\"

  body: "I would agree with you to some degree. I while the R does look different,
    I think its the \"regular\" character set, and the R is EBERT is from an alternate
    - much like American Typewriter. That and how the font was transformed.\r\n\r\nI
    still feel like this is a font. Amercian Typewriter is close, but some of the
    characters are different.\r\n\r\nThanks. Anyone else? Agree, disagree?"

  body: This logo has certain subtle things that make me believe it was hand-drawn
    by a skilled letterer, such as the way the bottom of the S is moved in to make
    it fit better next to the A, and the widened serif at the top of the A. Same with
    the R and T on the second line. Also notice that the middle strokes of the E and
    the Rs on the first line do not follow the curve, but are horizontal, indicating
    that fitting the letters into the curve was done visually, not mathematically.
