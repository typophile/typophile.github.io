body: I like the critique section at <a href="http://www.experimenta.co.nz/index.html">Experimenta</a>.
  Do you know any others writing critique like this?

  body: It reminds me of the type reviews in the now-defunct <em>Critique</em> magazine.
    Type reviews like this still show up almost monthly in <em>Print</em> and <em>Step</em>;
    Paul Shaw writes the <em>Print</em> reviews with a degree of depth seen nowhere
    else. Occasionally a typeface critique/feature pops up in <em>Metropolis</em>.
    The <em>Metropolis</em> reviews tend to be about typefaces that would interest
    architects and city planners, ie. Vialog, and are written to that audience, so
    they can be more thought provoking than crits aimed at print/web designers.

  body: "I second James' suggestion: look for any Paul Shaw review, and if the magazines
    are uninteresting, try to check them at some library or borrow them. Paul is n\xBA1\u2026
