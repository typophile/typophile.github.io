    contrast in /A/ is the wrong way round (rotate /V/ 180 degrees)."

  body: Yes I second Jean. Provide a PDF because your image is rather small and blurry.
    We could see letters bigger in a PDF. With or without actual text for starters.

    - I will try to change the contrast of the A to see if it looks better. Thanks
    for the feedback."

  body: "I can see that you've put lots of work into this so please consider this
    a positive critique even though I think (know) this font face has lots of work
    to do:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Letters are often copied/rotated/flipped which makes their
    strokes invalid.</li>\r\n<li>Some of them are round (o) others are not (q)</li>\r\n<li>Some
    accents are too thin and stylistically different</li>\r\n<li>It seems round letters
    have more overshoot at the bottom than at the top</li>\r\n<li>/j/ has angled/broken/distracting
    descender</li>\r\n<li>/s/ is strongly falling to the right</li>\r\n<li>/z/ is
    way too wide</li>\r\n<li>Overall letter weight differs considerably</li>\r\n<li>Some
    letters are unusually narrow (ie. /na/) while others are unusually wide (ie. /coewz/)</li>\r\n<li>/g/
    seems wobbly as not being that way as a feature but more of an error.</li>\r\n<li>some
    letters use ball terminals others don't which makes them \"strangers\" or better
    said \"non-relatives\"</li>\r\n<li>etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to
    put you off, but at this stage and looks of your letters this seems like a dead
    end project. You may learn a lot while doing it but you will either redraw it
    considerably to make it at least usable or start a new one after you gain some
    more experience.\r\n\r\nFor a beginner it's also usually better to go with a sans
    serif first because it's... well a bit easier (not a rule but usually is that
    way). Designing serifs with contrast stroke and not thinking of drawing them with
    a broad nib pen makes it even harder to succeed.\r\n\r\nSo. The main thing is
    <strong>I encourage you to continue</strong>, because you obviously like doing
    this (since you've devoted so much time to it already). In time and after few/many
    corrections/redraws you will become better and better and may eventually create
    something that will be usable in a designer sense of way.\r\n\r\n<em>(but who
    am I to judge since I'm not a formally educated designer at all even though some
    may've thought I am).</em>"
