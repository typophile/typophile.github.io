body: "Friends of mine, one of whom is of Sri Lankan ancestry, have asked me to help
  them design their wedding materials. They'd like to use the Sinhalese word for \"love\"
  as part of their imagery. This is an image of the word she sent me:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/love.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  basically wondering how much leeway I have in redoing this lettering, which I feel
  is kind of cold. I searched and found links to many different Sinhala fonts, so
  it appears I have as much freedom as I would with Western lettering, but not knowing
  anything about Sri Lankan culture, I just want to make sure I'm not being disrespectful
  by going too far one way or another.\r\n\r\nSo...anyone know any Sinhala lettering
  pitfalls I should avoid?\r\n\r\nBelow: a sampling of Sinhala fonts I found on one
  site, for reference:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sinhalafonts.jpg]"

  body: "The first trick will be to identify the appropriate style of lettering to
    use in the context of a wedding invitation, typically a classy but conservative
    genre. In the example you show, the style used in the Green text probably has
    most promise.\r\n\r\nThe second trick, if you plan to draw the lettering yourself,
    is knowing what form each letter takes within the particular style, and avoiding
    ignorantly mixing characteristics of different styles. Your best bet is to follow
    a model quite precisely, only making proportional adjustments to weight or height/width."
