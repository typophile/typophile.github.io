  used by another designer in another capacity the other day and recognized the distinctive
  \"W\" and \"k\". Can you please help with an ID? If this is a custom typeface, can
  you please point me in the direction of some similar script typefaces? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance. \r\n\r\nhttp://yfrog.com/1rworkforfoodp"
