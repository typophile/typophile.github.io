body: any ideas? I am looking for a typeface match--hoping--for the name of the restaurant
  Cili. We&#39;re doing a commercial for a client that is doing a promotion with this
  restaurant. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.cili.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cili.com/</a>

  body: I suspect this is hand drawn, because the  i&#39;s are not exactly identical,
    but I think you could come pretty close to simulating this using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Arnova"
    target="_blank">ITC Arnova</a>. It would take little more than rotating some of
    the letters to match the slope of the original, and perhaps adding a serif to
    the &#39;c&#39;. <BR> <BR>I admit I didn&#39;t hunt very long for this, and there
    may be better matches, but as I said, I doubt this is a font.

  body: Thanks, Mike. Arnova is close. I also found Banshee. But in the end decided
    it was easier to re-draw the blasted thing. Thanks though, you ARE the script
    king!
