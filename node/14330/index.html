  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>I wish to hear your opinions about one of the newest type foundries who follows the same direction of humanist emotional connotations who inspired me everyday on my latino vernacular handpainted neighbourhood signage.
I think that the sense of humor and the emotional relation of his products samples design to his customers its a great strategy.
The Logo brand its a handpainted swashy lettering who is very similar to some humoristic comercial signage here in Chile..
I think that Sauna and Dolly are the better works from Underware until now, because they are very versatile. Auto its a great work too but its ductos is maybe too much squared and geometrical. Bello pro its a nice Display font but i think that its very hard to read..maybe they can do a better version keeping the same flavour but adding more functionality as a type. I wish to add some critique to his display works because i feel that i am in the same way or direction to this guys and i like to see more and more type designs like Dolly and Sauna from independent designers.</p>
<p>BTW, i like to know which method use Underware to design fonts, they work in group right?
Personally i wish to be oriented to get sucessful finished fonts with a similar way of work..</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>mh.</p>

The projects provide a good insight into the way they approach type. <a href="http://www.typeworkshop.com">www.typeworkshop.com</a>  They also published a little booklet called five point that is a good read, I think you can still order it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve become completely enamoured with Underware&rsquo;s work, particularly Dolly, Sauna, and Bello. I got my hands on their Dolly and Sauna specimen books w/ free trial versions of the fonts (what a great idea) and 5 pts at TypeCon. I opened up my laptop on the way home and started playing with the fonts. Underware just seem to be genuinely enjoying and loving what they do and having mischievous fun, while still doing great work. On top of that, they&rsquo;re teaching students how to do the same thing. Their font specimens are full of funny and interesting writing, not just strings of meaningless words, another reason I like getting my hands on their stuff.</p>
<p>My appreciation of their work has a lot to do with what I know of Undeware as a whole, not just how much I like the fonts. Their work has been instrumental in getting my ass in gear on a font, as well.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I like Underware.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I always follow they workshop and other stuff like typereadio at typecon 2005 showing some black gothic new font in action. It´s anyone informed about how Underware work with the elaboration of his fonts? I don´t know if any media related magazine or website have interview the underware guys asking similar questions..i am looking forward to know more about them.</p>
<p>BTW, its a good idea for Typographica or Typophile to make posts dedicated to interview or make questions to typographers, foundries or people who are interesting to learn with.
Maybe a new forum called &ldquo;Interviews&rdquo;, depends if the typographers are available or open to respond direct questions from users of the forums.</p>
<p>I think that they first Underware workshops rules. Making type solutions for common design issues in a fun way, its something that i wish to take too for a model of education in graphic design classes too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miguel, I also am just bowled over the brilliance and freshness of the Underware work&ndash;and like you I prefer Dolly and Sauna, for the same reasons you give.</p>
<p>According to the article Stephen refers to (half in reversed type, white out of mauve, not even bolded&ndash;give me a break!) the three work as a true collaborative.</p>
<p>And there is this: &ldquo;[Sami] mentions the importance of the Royal Academy&rsquo;s practical approach of hand sketching, where the student learns to trust hand and eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hrant is always railing against &ldquo;chirography&rdquo;, type influenced by the hand, but judging by Underware we should more often let go of the mouse, and pick up the pencil. (I know, I know, sketching type and writing are two different things.)</p>
<p>I asked to Karsten Luecke (part of the amazing Village collective, including Underware) at TypeCon: &ldquo;These Underware guys are so amazing, where <em>do</em> they come from?&rdquo; His answer: &ldquo;Holland, of course.&rdquo;  Judging by the students and students of students of G. Noordzij, I am sure going to reread his book Letterletter again, and read the one about to come out in English.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s relevant. How relevant depends on the person. As I said, person, school, nationality, in that order. If nationality is emotionally important to the person it becomes more important. But school, and here I mean the formative, professional schooling (eg graduate school for academics,) I think often trumps nationality, when the person is working in the profession.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly, I associate rather austere, pristine beauty with Dutch, German and Finnish design. Underware has that discipline of northern Europe craft, but the exhuberance of Mediteranean countries. I think their freedom from national stereotype is part of their charm.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the influence of school is being hijacked by the push for standardized testing in American schools. Far from being independent, school curricula are increasingly being dictated by the test-writers, who tend to have their own agenda to promote.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi William, thank you for mention handdrasw type.
I use to draw type by hand, almost 45 minutes every day..i am addict to draw letterforms.
There are one big important thing that i like about Ultrafonts vision. To conect venecian and roman proportions with a cute small exageration in some letters..i think that this combination is my personal conection with vernacular signage here in my town. I think its amazing to feel that the same forms are present in other cultures. It seems like the innocent child face like cute proportions are universal principles of design who will be always recognised as fresh, nice, cool, fun and friendly.</div>

<p>Btw, Underware´s (eccept dolly, Bello and sauna) seems to be in different styles. That´s pretty good for new horizons experimentations but i really want to believe that they are back in good text fonts instead of been near to HouseInd fashionist display fonts.
Its this the dark side?</p>

<dt>If they continued to put out more display fonts than they did text fonts, that would be OK with me.</dt>

<p>Not the right kind though.
Evert would have probably made the first one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sauna is nice, Bello is great. But Auto is probably their most usable and also versatile faces. There&rsquo;s a degree of refinement to [[Underware|Underware&rsquo;s]] work that pushes it distinguishes it from typical display fonts &ndash; even though this seems to be where their work comes from.</p>
<p>The three Underware principals don&rsquo;t work in the same office and they deliberately blur the ownership of their fonts. Even though each face has a primary designer and the other two will give input and ideas, they don&rsquo;t attach their individual names to their fonts.</p>
<p>PS: Bill, sorry for making you strain at the white text. We wanted to make people earn it. I&rsquo;m kidding &ndash; in truth the pink tint came out a degree lighter than we expected.</p>
<p>PPS: It&rsquo;s a joy to kern upside down&hellip; Everyone should try it. =)</p>
