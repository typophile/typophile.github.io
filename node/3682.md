  body: There was a font called &#39;Bard&#39; that, if I recall correctly, was bundled
    with CorelDraw. It&#39;s the same design I think. No idea as to which one is the
    original, though.

  body: 'Image Club released the ATF version of Bamboo back in 1989. It was discontinued
    around 1998. You can still find copies of it on older Image Club LetterPress CDs.
    Sometimes these discs pop up on eBay, and I have some '
