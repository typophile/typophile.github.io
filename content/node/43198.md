  anyone? I do not know if there are letters too or whether this is a numeral-only
  face."

    the answer to this too. Doesn't look like anything I can recall seeing.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Searched FontShop and MyFonts using terms for high contrast and found one
    with a similar concept, but not Nouveau-ish, called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/oakpark/|Oak
    Park]] by Robert Schenk. Interestingly, he uses these numerals again in another
    of his fonts, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/grandecort/|Grandecort]].\r\n\r\nClosest
    FontShop result was [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/breeze_virtual/?sample_text=0123456789|Linotype
    Breeze]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "To illustrate why I keep saying \"Art Nouveau\" look at the numerals from
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Skjald&x=12&y=9&sample_text=0123456789|Skjald]],
    from ATF, and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/artistik/?sample_text=0123456789|Artistik]]
    from Bauer in Berlin.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\np.s. Stewf, any chance FontShop
    could keep sample text set by the user until it is reset or changed? It's a pain
    to keep re-doing it for each page.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@populuhv: don't castigate me for the quality, but I went out and shot some
    pics for you, just before dawn.  You can  temporarily see them at [[http://niels.kicks-ass.org/public/buildings/|my
    site]]. It is a block of 91 houses in the style of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_School|Amsterdam
    School]], so bowfinpw was pretty right in his art nouveau-assertion.  \r\n\r\nI
    would not be surprised if these numerals were either designed by the architect
    or if their design was especially commissioned for this project. As the block
    of houses is on the list of protected monuments and is currently being renovated,
    there is actually some chance I will find out.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I set
    about digitising these figures, as a way of learning how to use FontForge.  I'll
    keep you posted on either development.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
