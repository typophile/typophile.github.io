body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any suggestions about rhythm of letterform
  design when working with the uppercase and lowercase?  <BR> <BR>In my case, I just
  finished sketching out the lowercase letters and am now trying to complete the uppercase.
  However, I do not know how to approach the uppercase in a way that I can retain
  the lowercase characteristics; lowercase seems more rounder than uppercase, which
  seems to have very sharp corners and angles.  <BR> <BR>In terms of rhythm, how would
  you design a upper/lower case set and yet at the sametime keep coherence so that
  they complement each other. Also, expanding out, how can this be applied to all
  other sets within its family?  <BR> <BR>Please help, thank you.

  body: Well, first of all I feel that &#34;rhythm&#34; is a misleading term &#40;at
    least in the realm of text fonts&#41;. <BR> <BR>But terminological issues aside,
    the one &#40;possibly counter-intuitive&#41; thing I&#39;ve discovered about designing
    caps is that you can&#39;t make them too harmonious with the lc - that backfires.
    You just have to let them be what they need to be, and stick to ensuring overall
    stylistic consistency, even color, etc. Unless you&#39;re trying to break new
    ground... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    novelty. <BR>Attached is a sample from the course I had with Mr. Laurent Rebena,
    <BR>from Paris, note the differences in the scripts. <BR>If you want to understand
    Rhythm you can look at the moon, <BR>count from one to four when you skip or listen
    to music; <BR>or you can buy a book on calligraphy, take a pen and the ink, <BR>start
    with the Chancery style &#40;Cancelleresca&#41;. Don&#39;t be afraid, <BR>you
    won&#39;t fall into the inkpot. <BR>Best, <BR>AS <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/40913.gif"
