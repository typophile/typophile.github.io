  Script</a></strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adios-Script-pdf-1_3748.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
  part of the <strong><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/qfr6dl\">PDF specimen</a></strong>,
  the mexican photographer Brenda Dan was invited to collaborate with some beautiful
  image.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adios-Script-pdf-2_6062.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adios-Script-pdf-9_6227.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adios-Script-pdf-10_4508.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adios-Script-pdf-11_5182.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adios-Script-pdf-14_3488.jpg]\r\n\r\nRomantic,
  decorative Adios Script is one of Alejandro Paul\u2019s most elaborate and technically
  refined faces to date. Inspired by designs in \u201Chow-to\u201D commercial lettering
  guides of the 1940s, it has been refined and brought into the 21st century through
  a huge variety of ornate swash letterforms. The lowercase \u201Ch\u201D alone offers
  43 variants. Hundreds of ornamental ascenders and descenders allow a beautiful interplay
  of strokes and combinations, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts. Adios Script
  features a mind-boggling 1,470 characters in total, in OpenType format.\r\n\r\nVeer
  just released a very nice <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/ideas/galleries/adios/\">slideshow</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
