  body: Chris, some of the preferred Serbian forms may also be accepted as stylistic
    variants for non-Serbian language, including Russian. The Serbian be and italic
    de are both forms that are found in some Russian typefaces, and could be made
    available via 'salt' or one of the stylistic set features.

  body: "Chris, I believe the language tag is SRB, not SER.\r\nAt least that's what
    was in the online resource I checked; but I didn't keep a record of where it was,
    and haven't checked back.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, in Serbia they would be using a keyboard
    driver that specified \"SRB\", and that would activate the features tagged thusly
    in a font."

  body: "The keyboard driver is usually unrelated to activating features and does
    not need to know anything about OT language tags. All it does is pass codepoints
    in to the OS. The OS or application needs to tag the text with the appopriate
    language. The OS or app could derive the language from the keyboard selection,
    but what then about cases where a single keyboard can be used for multiple languages?
    Or text is imported or copied and pasted from some other source?\r\n\r\nSome applications
    may try to derive the script and/or language from the particular codepoints being
    used. This is obviously prone to error, particularly if it's language rather than
    script that is driving the processing.\r\n\r\nSo the most reliable method is to
    have the end user needs specify the language. InDesign CS3 relies on this; when
    the end user specifies the language for spelling and hyphenation purposes, that
    also serves to tell InDesign what language tag applies.\r\n\r\nThe downside of
    InDesign CS3's approach is that currently users can't specify a language they
    don't have a dictionary for. I hope to see this limitation removed in a future
    version of InDesign. But for now I'm pretty glad to have language-specific OT
    feature processing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "There was a bug in CS2 that made adding the exception dictionary to a document
    unworkable -- we did send in a bug report, but Adobe doesn't acknowledge them
    as policy, so we have no way of knowing what the final disposition was. Has this
    been fixed in CS3? If not, then you can only have an \"application\" exception
    dictionary. This means if there are variables for a particular job, you have to
    change the dictionary, write it off, save it with the job, & reinstall it in the
    system for each job when proof comes back.\r\n\r\nSince the bug occurred with
    differences in word endings following an apostrophe (OK with one letter following
    the apostrophe, not OK with more than one letter), this may or may not affect
    some of these languages."
