body: "I've used this font before (as you can see), but with the demize of my hard
  drive, I can't seem to find it anymore. There seems to be a couple somewhat unique
  features of this particular font:\r\n\r\n1 - somewhat condensed, although I KNOW
  'condensed' isn't part of it's name\r\n2 - handwritten type of lowercase 'g'\r\n3
  - uppercase 'W' has slight curve to the center point, isn't straight\r\n4 - numbers
  are even across top & bottom\r\n\r\nThanks for any help. Sorry the example isn't
  of better quality.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hubbysfont_4023.JPG]"
