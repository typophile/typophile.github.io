  have rounded guillemets. \r\n\r\nNo one is to blame of course!\r\nThis form has
  always been rare and can mostly only be found in fonts by Imprimerie Nationale (as
  the exemple here provided shows). \r\n\r\nWhats the advantage? Some typefaces have
  pointed guillemets which are - to my taste - too visible. Rounded ones would be
  softer to the eye and blend in better in text - much like the quotes (\u201Csuch\u201D)."

    they should stand out. Formal harmony is great for display setting, but during
    immersion you often need a little jolt.\r\n\r\nMy favorite guillemets? The ones
    in IN's \"Nouvelle Gravure\".\r\nAs far as I'm concerned they can be used for
    both French and English!\r\nDid I put a sample of them on Typophile recently?
    I'm blanking out.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Good point Hrant about display usage. Maybe such guillemets would be a
      good option (opentype \u201C.alt\u201D) in that context, especially."

    as additional quotation marks besides regular single and double quotation marks,
    And French-like guillemets are never used in a serious publication."
