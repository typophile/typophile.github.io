body: "Hi\r\nI'm trying to find a modern and serious script, that is easy to read
  both in print and on screen. The key is that it should look like it's actually handwritten,
  but also feel up-to-date. The fonts in the forums I have browsed through here (that
  I have found) don't have the contemporary feel to that I need, \r\nthanks, Kristofer"

    that's not too formal, you might find a serious and easy to read \"script\".\r\n\r\nFor
    example, Jenson italic or Arno italic."

    fonts</a> meets your needs. I think Calliope might be the thing.

    is a public service!
