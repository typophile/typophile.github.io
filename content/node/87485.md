body: I'm just curious, does anyone know of any plans on an English-written book covering
  the career of Hans Peter Willberg? Or maybe are there any plans to have some English
  translations of his books written in German? With the recent release of two books
  on Excoffon, I'm hoping someone might be doing something on the great work of Willberg.

    in English.
