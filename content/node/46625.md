body: "For all FontLab users out there who hate building numbered lists for FontLab
  encoding files, especially as glyph complements are getting bigger and bigger.\r\n\r\nWe
  have just updated a tool that helps to manipulate text lists of glyph names. With
  it you can renumber a sequence of glyphs using a new text file of glyph names or
  an existing FL encoding file.\r\n\r\nThe tool will pick out the first word of each
  line in the text file and re-apply the encoding sequence starting with the number
  you give. You can leave empty blocks or incorporate dummy sequences using the codes
  shown.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\nNever use it on a FontLab encoding file in the Encodings
  folder, always use a duplicate.\r\n\r\nIt's not much but it helps us, so we are
  sharing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScreenGrab_4177.jpg]\r\n\r\nDownload

    In my setup the glyphs are coming in the order I write them in a simple text file
    with a break after each word.\r\n\r\nI must have been missing something? :)"

  body: "Goran\r\n\r\nIt is a way to give a visual reference to different groups of
    glyphs.\r\n\r\nIf like me, you work in FL with a 32 cell wide font grid, it is
    good to group glyphs in a similar pattern, e.g. Cap A-Z in cells 65-90 and smallcap
    a-z in cells 385-410, 10 rows down.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, just a personal preference.\r\n"

  body: "Arthur, I agree with you, Type1's need to have the encoding defined correctly
    to match the output, but with TrueType and OpenType the encoding scheme is just
    a convenient way of displaying the glyphs in a layout grid, which I find is quite
    important when working on fonts of many hundred glyphs.\r\n"

  body: "That's a very neat tool! I am using it for my current project. Now I can
    bin the clumsy spreadsheet I had been using for this purpose.\r\n\r\nJust a little
    cosmetic \"feature request\": Would it be possible not to give empty lines a number
    (but still increase the count)? The only effect would be that in FontLab these
    cells would get the caption \"---\" instead of the number, which helps when you
    use them as intentionally empty \"spacers\"."

    are separate toolbars for the application window, the font window-where the entire
    font is displayed, and for the glyph editing window-where the individual characters
    are edited.that mekes the designing very easy. \r\nVik\r\n--------\r\n[[http://ilsmedicalreference.org|Local
