  body: I think this is a custom font based on one of Zapf&#39;s types like Aldus,
    with a &#39;medieval&#39; T mixed in for a more historical feel. The squarish
    open counter on the R is like Aldus  &#40;&amp; Palatino&#41;, but the serif-less
    middle arm on the E is more like Aldus. I can&#39;t find a picture of Michelangelo
    by him, but it may also be similar. The T is a misfit, in any case, I think.
