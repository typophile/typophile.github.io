  Impact, and now i have to find artworks with Impact in them for compilation. Spent
  hours rummaging in the library, and i only found one artwork out of 6 type books.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  knows of artworks with the font Impact? Will be real help. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Art work? I don't know if this counts, but Impact seems popular among the
    makers of LOL cats and O'RLY owls. They're all over the news comment forums and
    such.

    piece of graphic 'art' in Arial- a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nIs it still to late
    to change your mind?\r\n\r\nMike :-)"
