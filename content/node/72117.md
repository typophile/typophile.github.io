    TheAntiqua as the body face to accompany Dax.

  body: "Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nSince I need to make a decision before purchasing
    and it's difficult to envision the two appearing in unison based just on [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/typeshow/?ts-font=TheAntiquaB&ts-style=Plain|TypeShow]],
    I'm wondering if you know of an online sample where the two appear in unison,
    or if not, what in your opinion would be the rational of matching the two together.\r\n\r\nYour
    help is very much appreciated"

  body: "Sorry, you'll have to figure that out for yourself.\r\nI offered an example;
    rationales and samples are beyond the call of duty.\r\n\r\nI did not in fact recommend
    TheAntiqua as a partner for Dax: all I can say is that the art director of that
    particular magazine was able to make them \"go well\" with one another -- others
    might not be so successful. Or perhaps their time together is past."

  body: "Dear Nick,\r\n\r\nIt's quite difficult for me to form an opinion without
    actually \"seeing\" the printed piece you are referring to, hence the question
    as to your recollection on the matter. It might surprise you, but yes, your personal
    opinion is highly regarded, and I don't think I deserve a beating just for asking
    (this is a help forum about 'opinions', isn't it?). In any event, I will respect
    your reluctance to elaborate and would like to thank you again for your response.\r\n\r\nBack
    to square one, any ideas anyone?\r\nPlease help."

  body: "<em>I don't think I deserve a beating just for asking.</em>\r\n\r\nMy apologies
    if you found my reply harsh, Sam.\r\nIt certainly wasn't intended that way.\r\nI
    don't have access to my library at the moment, as I haven't got around to unpacking
    it after a move last year, which is why I'm reluctant to go digging through boxes
    looking for old copies of NS that I might have hung onto, and then scanning and
    posting them for you. If you would consider paying me for that service, it would
    probably be less expensive to license the fonts.\r\n\r\nIf I am to be accused
    of a beating, let me continue...\r\n\r\nHow is it \"difficult to envision the
    two appearing in unison\"?\r\nYou can see with just a word of each, online, that
    they have very, very similar proportions: horizontal scale, x-height, ascender
    overshoot of cap height.\r\n\r\nSurely you have worked with types that have similar
    proportions to each, so don't you have enough of a feeling about types with that
    kind of proportion, and about these types in particular (based on their detailing),
    to have enough of a feeling of how they will work together? And of how <em>you</em>
    might use them, without aping the design of <em>New Scientist</em>?\r\n\r\n"
