  for a friend. Now he want's to make a french version of his logo. Since I outlined
  the text on the logo, I need to find what's the font I used. Any idea?\r\n\r\nI
  already tried WhatTheFont and WhatFontis without success. So don't waste your time
  there.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!!!"

    version only exists digitally as a font from OPTI (now defunct font company that
    was infamous for creating unlicenced clones, delivered en masse on CDs)."

  body: "Thanks you all!\r\n\r\nWith Augustea, you guys put me o the right track.
    \r\n\r\nI found the one i used 10 years ago. It's called Augustus. Probably a
    deviation of the original Augustea.\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/fr/augustus.font\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!!!"

  body: "As far as I can determine the OPTI NovaAugustea -- without facets and including
    Nebiolo's lower case -- is one of the few original fonts produced by the long
    defunct OPTI company. Unfortunately, there is no legitimate way in which it can
    be acquired for commercial use.\r\nI have no information on the legal status of
    the Augustus font at dafont.\r\nDon"
