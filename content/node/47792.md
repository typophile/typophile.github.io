body: "Hello again!\r\n\r\nI'm doing logo and layout for my student organizations
  member magazine.\r\n\r\nIt's a swedish magazine and is called \"Askungen\" wich
  translates to either cinderella or ash kid (ask ungen). The organizations name is
  ASK (Arcada Studerandek\xE5r). So the name of the magazine is an amusing one.\r\n\r\nI'm
  pairing Daw Wide, which is their font and can't be changed, with Caecilia. I already
  made the calender where I used this combination and I think it works quite well
  (http://petergranfors.com/clients/ask/kalender_klar.pdf).\r\n\r\nNow i have started
  on a logo set in Dax Wide black. I'm planning on using Dax Wide light for headlines
  in the magazine and maybe Dax Wide black for larger articles. Caecilia will be used
  for body text.\r\n\r\nHere's what I got so far. I'd like to soften the Dax Wide
  and the two second versions are an attempt at that. The small text is Dax Wide bold
  in one version and Caecilia heavy in the other.\r\n\r\nCastigate away...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/askungen_logo_v1_5470.jpg]"

  body: I prefer the modified headline of the last two. I would use Caecilia for the
    lower text. I think it provides nice contrast,

    ash. Like someone put out their cigarette(s) on the logo.\r\n\r\nthe logo will
    either be in all black or white depending on the background.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/askungen_logo_v2_4248.jpg]"

  body: "Yeah I'm worried about that too. Right now I'm thinking about making the
    cover very busy and then this style will probably not fit as well.\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to work on the cover for a while and see what becomes of it and continue
    with this later."

  body: "I think the \"corporate\" direction is coming through as a result of the
    font choice. Not that it's necessarily bad, but I think something with a little
    more drastic style to it \u2014 especially since this is for a magazine \u2014
    will serve your purpose better. Try experimenting with more extreme weight differentials
    between \"ask\" and \"ungen\". Or even extreme weights across the board (by that
    I mean ultra thin or ultra bold).\r\n\r\nAll in all I think this is much better
    than you had before, but I do agree with Ratbaggy, that it may be too corporate
    for your intended audience.\r\n\r\npenn"

    also thinking about dropping the \"Arcada studerandek\xE5rs medlemstidning\" text
    from the logo and add it as part of the layout on the front cover instead.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/askungen_3869.jpg]"
