body: "If ANYONE wishes to believe me a little loony\u2014which, might be possible,
  considering that I have quite intentionally made a considerable effort to insinuate
  that possibility indubitably\u2014may now consider the preceding\u2014as well as
  the following\u2014proof more or less conclusive. Trust me on this.\r\n\r\nThe glyph
  most representative of what 666 is alleged to represent is\u2026$\r\n\r\nWhy? Because
  a money-changer (who changes money in the opposite direction from which Jesus would,
  I figure, do) walked into a temple (in name only; details to follow) which, I suspect,
  is Christian in name only (doh!), declared that all the money in the temple was
  Caesar's (if he gets the job and, brother, is Mitt THE right tool for the right
  job; details to follow), all of which should\u2014again, predicated on the ridiculous
  notion that I have a clue what Jesus would actually do in any given situation, much
  less this: if what I can only assume to be true from the so-called reality which
  ALMOST everyone else on the planet is true, then Jesus has every right to be pissed\u2014as
  he is alleged to have done in the only \u201Ccredible\u201D source on the subject,
  written by profits (this is NOT a typo) who profited ($ or functional equivalent)
  by peddling every word that they put into the mouth of God is the Absolute Gospel
  Truth (math majors: prove the inevitability of the conclusions, based on the premises).\r\n\r\nAnd
  who profits from the word of the prophets who peddle the profits based on the most
  advantageous \u201CWord of God\u201D?\r\n\r\nWho allegedly knew that money only
  had as much power as you give it (which, according to the Supreme Court\u2014who
  look nothing like the Supremes, nor as they nearly as smart in ANY sense of the
  word) is UNLIMITED\u2014simply if you believe it? Who buys every word of it here\u2014every
  time they get an inkling that the \u201Cbig money guys\u201D will screw with them\u2026personally,
  by helping\u2026me?\u2026in ANY way\u2026even to the point of denying me a free
  beer? Doh! Duh! I still find it amusing.\r\n\r\nSo, I figure: believe in God (who
  is Love) or believe in 666, which is $. Each is as real as you believe it to be
  (welcome to the internet: Marshall MacLuhan WARNED it would be spell-binding). Believe
  in Heaven on Earth (could it REALLY be ANYWHERE else?); or believe in Hell: right
  here, right now, QED. Tragedy? Comedy? Happy ending? Or the end of the world? Or
  believe that loon Ron Paul? John Lennon was pretty much right, every time he opened
  his mouth\u2014and he wound up dead. So did Jesus\u2014but he had a hell of an out,
  which I no longer have any credible reason is true, since it\u2019s based on making
  a profit from people killing themselves as quickly as possible. Devout Muslims score
  big-time on this one; however, a true believer is a true believer, no matter which
  words you use\u2014which a true Muslin was so openly joyous when he missed the first
  chance to share the truths of his heart with someone as nutty as to walk into an
  Indian restaurant, run by Pakistani Muslims who were fasting for Ramadan but could
  NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES accept a NON-ALCOHOLIC\u20140.0% (Halal++), bought
  from the corner grocery the owner\u2019s Muslim brother ran and have the temerity
  to ask anyone to not share a beer in exchanging for confessing the things his heart
  which he believes to be ABSOLUTELY TRUE\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, imagine my joy on such
  a chance (not a chance) meeting in which we placed our hands on each other\u2019s
  hearts and testified\u2026\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same words, except\u2026I did so
  in English, and he did so in Urdu (lucky for me, you and the whole world, potentially),
  only in different words. Duh. Doh. Uh-oh.\r\n\r\nGod gave you free will: exercise
  and create the future, or relive the past (Go, George Santayana!). If you have been
  paying attention, I have given you no choice: toast my old man in Wilwaukee and
  take the pledge (available online\u2014if you can find it), or the world ends\u2026your
  $666$ way. Who are you going to believe? Well, if Lozos will deliver the rimshot:
  me. If you can\u2019t take a joke, I am dying anyway. Which is inevitable and hopeless\u2014unless
  it isn\u2019t and Alan Watts is right. And if NOBODY can take this joke\u2026the
  punchline is inevitable eight ways to Sunday: cash, credit, as unreal as possible
  (preferably ACH!!!), but only Amex under very special circumstances\u2026like, when
  Hell freezes over.\r\n\r\nP.S. As soon as lightning strikes twice in the same place
  (God only know that) at some time (ditto),\r\nEither Cassandra (probably) or Tinkerbelle
  (I hope) will get the predicted ending. Scholarly folk: clue them in and, in this
  context, the context of the former is important, because the context is actually
  where reality started getting taken out of context, which is reality\u2014precisely
  as nature intended it.\r\n\r\nMake a copy quick: Western Civilization is going down
  if I, personally, as God has made abundantly clear through his one and only non-profit
  prophet (I did not ask for this job) if one sober person in this joint will not
  at least OFFER to buy me a beer, for fear of pissing off the big money which exists
  only because you believe in money, but you do not believe in Love. Or free beer.
  No joke. Seriously.\r\n"

    paper is still real; going viral is not confined to the internet. I got back-up:
    Army, Navy, former Maximum Security Prison guard, regular folks, large muscular
    black men, dogs, regular folk\u2014peppered all over. Take us all on (you MAY
    already know who they are) if you can find them (disregard previous message),
    or wipe us all out.\r\n\r\nCaution: Mormon virgins nearby. Sacrifice them and
    PROVE just how barbaric you aren't. Even if this message never actually reaches
    the internet (I firmly believe that almost anything is possible, but prefer to
    assign as little credibility to the uncomfortable stuff, unless given credible
    reason to believe so), it got through to the right folks. If so, wipe us out\u2014I
    have made a pretty good case where the impossible might inevitably happen, only
    now the time is the only issue. Proofs of this promise supposedly existed in the
    White House when I tossed it out. If it turns up not to be there, tell me something
    I might not have anticipated. Because what I don't know will, in fact kill me\u2014but
    (yo, Fred) what does not kill me\u2026\r\n\r\nPray I am wrong and I am dead. Pray
    I am right, and do it the right way\u2014to God, who must necessarily exist in
    order to pray. Doh!\r\n\r\nRimshot, dammit! Or gunshot. Or freak lightning from
    nowhere, or plausible probability of something kinda like it. I did ask for it,
    didn't I? Language people: decipher this before 666 does..."
