  body: I'm not familiar with Taylor Gothic either. But the Globe Gothic sample seems
    very inspired by Clearface (or could it be vice versa?). If Clearface predates
    any of them then I would be inclined to give the nod to Benton.

    article</a> in it's entirety, but a portion is extracted from Luc Devroye's page
    on The Inland Press. (Luc sites his sources: \"The sources for this text include
    an article by James Eckman in PAGA, vol. 8, pp. 31-52, 1960, entitled The Inland
    Type Foundry, 1894-1911, and an annotated list of typefaces in Mac McGrew's famous
    book, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century (1986, Oak Knoll, New
    Castle, DE).\")\r\n\r\n<em>Globe Gothic is a refinement of Taylor Gothic, designed
    about 1897 by ATF at the suggestion of Charles H. Taylor of the Boston Globe,
    and used extensively by that paper. But Taylor Gothic has mostly the same lowercase
    as Quentell, though with hairlines heavied a bit. ATF's Central Type Foundry branch
    in St. Louis claims to have originated Quentell (q.v.) in 1895 or earlier. The
    conversion to Taylor Gothic was designed by Joseph W. Phinney, while the redesign
    as Globe Gothic in about 1900 is credited to Morris Benton.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    you should read this <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/threadrss/18136\" target=\"new\">OLD
    Typophile thread</a> containing McGrew's claim about Studley vs. Taylor/Globe
    Gothic (though I could only find it as an XML feed... a little distracting read).\r\n"

    McGrew quote on Globe clarifies it's history but I'm still not sure if it's original
    enough to include with his other gothics. "

  body: If it's "originals" that you are listing, I personally would follow the references
    on "Taylor Gothic" (J.W. Phinney) as being <em>closer</em> to the original and
    "Globe Gothic" (M.F. Benton) as being a refinement/rework.

    body: "Well that's kinda my question. When a type designer does a face that is
      a refinement or rework of another face can you say that's their design? Or,
      if you were making a list of Benton's gothics what criteria would you use or
      should you use?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChuck"

    vs innovation argument. \r\n\r\nMF Benton worked at a time of consolidation of
    foundries, caused by the advent of machine typesetting--which had collapsed the
    demand for  foundry type for extended text. Pieces of the foundry type industry
    were put together by ATF, and MF Benton redrew, modified, and innovated the types
    of the companies they bought out. He did over a hundred faces--with superb craftsmanship.
    To what extent he reproduced and to what extent innovated varies with the typeface,
    and it is a major undertaking to trace exactly what happened. \r\n\r\nSo the only
    way to be accurate is to tell the history, and that takes a lot of historical
    research."
