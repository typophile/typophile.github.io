body: "Hi all,\r\nFirst off, I have zero experience with coding and syntax for proper
  output.\r\n\r\nI have just finished a typeface with the usual ligatures (fl, fi,
  ffl, ffi, even st & ct) and I want to make the ligatures automatic instead of being
  forced to navigate to the glyphs palette and manually apply ligatures.\r\n\r\nI
  know the answer is in Robofab or Python but I do not have any experience with them
  and can't find a decent walk-through in the context of type design, specifically
  ligatures (since Python does all sorts of applications, type design being one).\r\n\r\nIs
  there not a standard snippet of code that applies to all typefaces that automates
  the ligatures? \"when U+0066 & U+0066 appear consecutively with U+FB00\"? \r\nI
  presume not.\r\n\r\nAlso, I use Fontographer 5.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    answer is correct, but just to elaborate, character substitution is done with
    OpenType features. Robofab and Python are used to automate font design tasks;
    they don\u2019t actually introduce any code into a font."

  body: "Also, I'll mention that recommended glyph names for ligatures are \"f_l\",
    \"f_i\", \"f_f\", \"s_t\", \"f_adieresis\" etc. \r\n\r\nSo your code would look
    like\r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\n# Latin\r\nsub f i by f_i;\r\nsub f l by f_l;\r\nsub
    f f by f_f;\r\nsub s t by s_t;\r\n# etc.\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\n(after \"sub\"
    you type in sequences of glyph names that should be replaced, after \"by\" you
    type in the glyph name that is inserted).\r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Dunwich/James, \r\n\r\nit's VFB, so it can \u2014 but since FOG doesn't have
    any UI for displaying the font features, the code won't be visible/accessible.
    \r\n\r\nI do recommend installing the demo version of FontLab Studio along Fontographer
    5. The demo version of FL Studio is free, and serves as an excellent in-depth
    font viewer. If you open an OpenType font in the FontLab Studio demo, you can
    export the font feature definitions from the OpenType panel into a .fea text file,
    edit it in a text editor and then use it in FOG 5 when generating the font. \r\n\r\nFontLab
    Studio 5 can only export font feature definitions in the older AFDKO 1.6 syntax.
    If you want to export font feature definitions including things like mark attachment,
    ie. in the AFDKO 2.5 syntax, you need to use a different tool, such as DTL OTMaster,
    which is also available from fontlab.com. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    font is named fi, it will have to be so named in the feature file.\r\n\r\nBetter
    to change the name to f_i in the font -- and of course, use f_i in the feature
    file (as Adam suggested). The \"fi\" glyph hangs around in some fonts, and is
    in Unicode, to accommodate legacy issues. Sort of like corsets . . ."
