  body: I think that it's Modula (a predigital VGC typeface - not the Emigre font
    available today).

  body: "Yep - that was it. The only digital version of this weight of Modula I'm
    aware of is the Casady & Greene (defunct for years now) font <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Kasse Bold</a>.\r\n\r\nC&G always altered the typeface a bit
    when they created their, er, \"versions\" of other fonts. Hence, their take on
    Modula is, among other things, wider. It is, though, the only thing available
    digitally as far as I know."
