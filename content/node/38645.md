  body: Why doesn't Cycles have bold and bold italic? I'd love to get it, but my books
    always require boldface somewhere, and of course for commercial work it's utterly
    useless! I'll NEVER understand how foundries can release a text family with half
    its nuclear members missing! What are you thinking, Mr. Stone?

    Mr. Stone?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, I\u2019m sure Sumner Stone didn\u2019t just forget
    about them. ;-)\r\n\r\n<cite>For 2600 years of making and re-making, the breeding
    of the Roman letter has been under way \u2026</cite> [from the introduction to
    the <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/Resources/CyclesSpecimenBook.pdf\">Cycles
    Specimen Book</a>]\r\n\r\nThough this passage actually is on optical sizes, I
    think it shows that Cycles is meant to be a book face in a <em>very very</em>
    classic sense. The idea of having bold weights (for serif text faces), in contrast,
    is quite young; in traditional book design there is/was no need for having a bold,
    let alone a bold italic.\r\n\r\nI can understand that you miss those weights and
    find it <cite>utterly useless</cite> for <cite>commercial work</cite>. But then,
    maybe Cycles never was made for loud advertising? And there are myriads of comparable
    faces that offer that \u2018modern\u2019 R-I-B-BI-variety. You always require
    boldface? Go with those alteratives! I, for one, appreciate the idea of making
    a nice text family with 7 (!) optical sizes, all featuring italics, small-caps,
    lining and os figures \u2026 And I\u2019d prefer it over just another \u2018nuclear
    members\u2019-quadrumvirate \u2013 with one or two members of such a \u2018value
    pack\u2019 gathering dust untapped.\r\n\r\nFurther reading: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31036\">Where
    do bold typefaces come from?</a>\r\nThere are also some interesting quotes in
    this thread, <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/8029\">Why doesn\u2019t Swift
    have a Bold Italic?</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>Some designers don't make a Bold-Italic
    as a form of functional romanticism, or you could call it capricious (or rebellious)
    anachronism.</cite> \u2014 Hrant H. Papazian\r\n\r\n<cite>Bold is type on junk
    food.</cite> \u2014 Giampa the Great\r\n\r\n<cite>As a type designer it's hell
    to make the bold italic weight.</cite> \u2014 Stefan Hattenbach\r\n"

  body: Yeah, I agree with Paul. Small Caps and Italics are a great way to create
    emphasis in text, and combined with space and layout options, hierarchy as well.
    Sure, in some designs, bolds, etc. have their place. But they are not requirements,
    and I certainly find them far less important than, for example, air conditioning.

  body: "<cite>...that\u2019s why it\u2019s so unjustified...adding a bold and bold
    italic does nothing to detract from the classical beauty of the face...</cite>\r\n\r\nActually,
    no, I think at times it does indeed \"detract from the classical beauty of the
    face\". By way of illustration, have a look at Alex Kazcun's 1991 expansion of
    Rudolf R\u016F\u017Ei\u010Dka's <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/420/fairfield-family.html\"
    target=\"new\">Fairfield</a>, which in part \"delicately tilt[ed] it from a pre-
    to a postmodern design\", as noted by Bringhurst in his <cite>Elements</cite>
    (3.0, p. 227). \r\n\r\nI have tried using Kazcun's Fairfield, but it's just not
    the same typeface. I suspect Cycles might also lose as much as it would gain were
    it to be expanded similarly.\r\n\r\nCycles is my favorite face for setting books.
    I've never missed the bold or bold italic styles, no more than I regret the same
    \"deficiency\" in other classic faces such as HF&J's Requiem or the Carter & Cone
    version of Galliard. As others have stated, the optical sizes, italics, small
    caps and various formatting options afford more than enough opportunity for emphasis
    and contrast.\r\n\r\nBy the way, <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/sfploverview.html\"
    target=\"new\">SFPL</a>, the four-style version of Cycles that Sumner Stone created
    for the San Francisco Public Library, does indeed contain a beautiful bold style,
    but still no bold italic."

  body: A quite untenable and out-of-date distinction...commercial work can be just
    as elegant as fine book design...I know; I do both. Mr. Stone did a bang-up job
    with the two bold weights and bold italics for Stone Serif...in fact, those bold
    italics look better than the bold romans. Truncating the offering like this just
    means he won't get the market penetration Cycles really deserves...that's why
    it's so unjustified...adding a bold and bold italic does nothing to detract from
    the classical beauty of the roman text face; it just gives the customer options
    he is entitled to have for the fancy price charged. Ditto for Requiem, which would
    be used all over the place by now if the foundry had enough sense to complete
    the family. Josh Darden's re-think of Fournier, Corundum, comes with three weights
    and full italics and he shows no hesitation at applying his VERY classic face
    to these helpful additional options. It's just good business. Nobody wants to
    live in a world without boldface any more than they want to live in a world without
    air conditioning!

  body: "I'm a little confused by the font formats, e.g. with Cycles. Could somebody
    shed some light please?\r\n\r\nAs seen at the optional ordering page at myfonts.com
    (Quote: \"If you would like to order individual fonts or download the fonts immediately
    on purchase, most of them are at myfonts.com\"), you can't choose Open Type OTF
    or Open Type TTF. But there are \"Windows/Mac OS X TTF\" and the PostScript versions
    of Mac or Windows.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking at the \"order\" button at Stone Type
    Foundry it says nothing about the font format. Although there is a passage about
    open type features at the overview page you can't choose a font format when continuing
    your order. So which one do you get? "

  body: thanks William...the semibold could offer a tad more contrast (I'm reminded
    of Sabon bold), and anyway we still need semibold italic as well. So frustrating!
    I'll never understand not properly equipping text families with a choice of well-contrasted
    weights! Stone Serif has three beautifully contrasted weights, so why can't Cycles?
