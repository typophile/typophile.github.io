body: 'The subject of this thread isn''t stritcly related to typefaces, but since
  there are many book design and illustrated books lovers here, I thought it would
  be the right place for sharing it. In the past days, thanks to an exhibition in
  Parma, Italy, I have met the wonderful work of Remy Charlip, an American illustrator,
  coreographer, dancer and much else. I had the chance to see several original editions
  of his books from the Fifties and Sixties - wonderfully illustrated, printed and
  crafted books, in the great tradition of Bruno Munari, Leo Lionni and Paul Rand.
  Charlip''s art has been a revelation, and I suggest everyone, particulary American
  typophiles, to go and look for his work. Besides the emotional content of his books,
  the "pureness" of his art seems also much related to a great attention in details,
  as the exhibition showed in the dummies and tests he made for the publishing houses
  before the books were printed: in one of these instructions, small labels of texts
  were typed in Century, and when the text had to be set reversed (white on black)
  Charlip added his instructions on how to make the letters a little stronger, trying
  to avoid the risk to weaken the strokes. Ok, my English is poor, but I think you
  got what I mean. A very nice find!'
