  very often used around London.\r\nIt has very characteristic round edges, which
  give it a soft look.\r\nUnfortunately I haven't got a picture, but I figured since
  it's often used, that you might know which font typeface I'm talking about?\r\nThanks
  a lot,\r\nLasse"

  body: Where is it used around London? Shop signs, posters, street signs in a particular
    borough? At the moment I can't think what you might mean. Name a font it is similar
    to.
