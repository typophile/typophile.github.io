    forum on Typedrawers that is only available to people active in the industry.

  body: The best thing to do is to report it to the individual larger foundries. They
    have the resources to do something about it if they want to. Reporting it to the
    FBI and/or Interpol as an individual is fruitless; they have much bigger fish
    to fry.

    (Mediafire, Depositfile, Rapidshare...) to remove content from their servers.
    So far, from one of them did what I asked. We'll see in few days will the others
    do the same.\r\n\r\nIt's not solution to this problem, since they can upload it
    again, under another link, but it's one small battle won.\r\n\r\n@frode \u2013
    If I understood what they wrote on their website, they will start doing it after
    they raise some planned amount of money and after you make donation to them, according
    to donation level scheme they have offered on website. Which is all OK, but I
    understood that they still haven't started fully their services.\r\n\r\n@ Ryan
    \u2013 I won't comment this, sorry.\r\n\r\n@ majus \u2013 That sounds like a good
    idea! Actually, that gave me an idea (which may sound ridiculous to some). What
    about making an organization of foundries, type designers, distributions... with
    one aim \u2013 to fight on legal ways against such websites who share font files
    illegally. Organization that will have lawyers, membership fee. Since individual
    fight is pretty useless and rarely succeeds. I don't know how all this sounds
    nor would it be possible to make something like this, but I'd say sooner or later,
    something must be done on some serious level by font market. "

    are missing a primary source for font data on the web. :)\r\n\r\nBTW, I know there
    is a debate on this topic that will go on Ad nauseam, but within the design group,
    exposure and use of a commercial font (prior to payment for said font) is likely
    more helpful than not. Since the designers get the clients to pay for the font,
    and anyone not interested in buying a license would have never paid for one anyway.\r\n\r\nAny
    type designer that actually makes money off their creations is probably making
    good fonts. Everyone else... I still see no evidence that any font designer can
    make a living off fonts - except for those few who license their fonts to HP,
    Microsoft, Apple, or another entity of similar stature. Even commissions for custom
    corporate fonts are usually subsidized with additional design work, yes?"

    introduction first.\r\n\r\nAbout what you said... your right is to protect what's
    your ownership and that's starting point. What comes after that is just a collection
    of other relative things (luck, verbal skills, realistic view, contacts, will...).\r\n\r\nI
    don't agree with you about second part \u2013 \"Any type designer that actually
    makes money off their creations is probably making good fonts. Everyone else...\"
    That is very relative statement. Mostly, the number of those who recognize what's
    good and what's not is on the side of the NOTs. Very often, font sale is dictated
    by customers opinion, those who buy it make something good, \"good\", bad or \"bad\".
    So when some type designer makes something, he might can predict how it will show
    up on market, but much more often it's hit or miss situation, just like with other
    things that are designed \u2013 different types of templates, themes, stock materials..."

  body: "Hrant - surely you jest! Perhaps you can count that number on one hand -
    possibly two. Beyond that... Even our good friend Mr. OldNick has shown that his
    revenues (and he has a sh*t ton of fonts) equates to less that US$50,000 per year
    BEFORE TAX, on average over the course of 11 years.\r\n\r\nThe smaller font aggregators
    are pulling in a little from everybody, but they have the overhead of a digital
    storefront, payment processing, etc. I would estimate they clear a few times that
    amount? Monotype seemingly owns the rest of the market (commercial licensing and
    embedded products). Eh, just my opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. tourdeforce: I was not
    asking for, nor wanting a link to the site you reference. I just note that there
    are at least two *private* forums that provide access to just about all fonts
    & foundries. Any site you could send someone to, without providing your login
    details will be inconsequential. I do agree that type designers never know what
    will be popular (i.e., actually sell), but more often than not, the good designers
    sell, and the not-so-good ones do not. 'Good' being the relative descriptor. Price
    point helps too :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
