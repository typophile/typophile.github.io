  body: Jason, I think the approach is wrong. Forget the computer and get a pad of
    paper and a pencil with an eraser and work on it. Your example is stale and computer
    driven. Create and then figure out how to produce it. Sorry If I sound harsh,
    I&#39;m not, but you can make mistakes on paper but the computer is too final
    an instrument to be loose and creative on. This is just my opinion. Dan

    your logo -- and btw, this isn&#39;t really a logo at all -- looks like a wedding
    card. It has nothing to do with what the shop actually does, but also isn&#39;t
    ideographic enouugh to be abstract. It&#39;s just fancy, trying to be artful but
    ending kitschy.  <BR>Trash it and start anew. Think about an intelligent way of
    communcating the IDEA of fishing &#40;please, no fishes or hooks or anything&#41;...
    make it funny or serious or beautyful or ugly or whatever fits your need... but
    make it mean something.  <BR> <BR>This is just ... empty, soulless. Devoid of
    an idea. Sometimes what you do can even be ugly as hell, but at least it has a
    soul. This however is just visual FX, bells and whistles &#40;and even at that,
    it&#39;s not much fun to look at&#41;, without a core, without a message, without
    a heart.  <BR> <BR>Shy away from a GRAPHICAL solution and find some communicational
    SOLUTION first. The rest will follow all by itself. '

  body: 'thanks for the comments... i guess i should have clarified what my objective
    was here... the shop opened up in the 30&#39;s and i am attempting to reference
    a visual language of that era relating to fishing. I have gone through tons of
    books and fishing magazines from the 30s and basically wanted to give this place
    a more modern feel, while referencing the past. This is where I am pulling for
    the type treatment: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19181.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>This is the &#34;logo&#34; i have been working on which
    would be on one side of the business card, while the logo type and info would
    go on the other. Again, I am attempting to reference the &#34;golden days&#34;
    of fishing by using the line art illustrations of that era as well as colors used
    in packaging. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19182.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Do you still think I should totally scrap everything and

    if the general consensus on here is that this is totally wrong, I have no problem
    trying something different. Any suggestions on how I should approach it differently?  Thanks

  body: 'Jason, your scroll work and the beginnings of what your type is showing did
    remind me of this. It makes sense that something &#34;out west&#34; or &#34;in
    the west&#34; would still have hints of Art Nouveau or Arts &amp; Crafts at this
    late of period as trends travelled rather slowly back then. <BR> <BR>Your scroll
    work is more nouveau than your type selection however. <BR> <BR>I would suggest
    working some roughs up first. Decide on the general shapes you could work with,
    keeping in mind the words you want to use. <BR> <BR>It might be more interesting
    to break the text up like this: <BR> <BR>Hook, <BR>Line &amp; <BR>Sinker <BR>
    <BR>Maybe you could work with squares or circles. &#40;general shapes&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Please do work more roughs up. I&#39;d be interested to watch the progression.'

  body: The fish on the old logo adds the...urp...flavor, so it works---kind of. Eliminating
    the fish reduces it to, as someone wrote, a wedding invitation feel, or a showcard
    feel &#40;like in the silent movies&#41;, especially considering the ornaments
    you used. <BR> <BR>This might be one of those instances where you start from scratch.
    Keep in mind that fonts often have a &#34;feel&#34; to them--I think, at least.
    Can&#39;t think of any fishy fonts that aren&#39;t kitschy, so you might want
    to go with artwork and a neutral font, or at least a font that is brave enough
    to go with the artwork. I think you can find something that still evokes the feel
    of &#34;old-fashioned&#34; without being too formal. <BR> <BR>Plus, this was for
    an old catalog, not a fish shop sign. I think the two are entirely separate entities.
    What I would choose for one, I probably wouldn&#39;t choose for the other, unless
    a font was &#42;just right&#42; for both.

  body: I like it a lot more, and it has a New England feel to it, but I&#39;m trying
    to envision this on a sign with the colors. <BR> <BR>Also, keep in mind that whatever
    you put a sign will probably also go on letterhead/business cards &#40;color/B&amp;W&#41;,
    newspaper ads &#40;B&amp;W--considering it&#39;s a store&#41;, possibly a yellow
    pages ad &#40;B&amp;W&#41;, bags &#40;color/B&amp;W&#41;, invoices &#40;B&amp;W&#41;,
    billboards &#40;?&#41;, packaging &#40;?&#41;, and more. Unless you know for certain
    a logo will be for a specific use only, design for &#42;all&#42; the possibilities.
    You don&#39;t know what the client will do with it down the road. <BR> <BR>And
    the above logo use possibilities are why one generally &#42;&#42;doesn&#39;t&#42;&#42;
    charge a pittance for a logo design. Fifty dollars  &#40;a figure I pulled out
    of my hat, but which is typical low-budget pricing&#41; may seem like a lot of
    money to some people, but think of all the name/brand recognition the client will
    be getting from YOUR design as their logo is disseminated to the community. That
    recognition is worth money you should be getting a piece of. It&#39;s how you
    pay the bills and not have watered-down ketchup and crackers for dinner. <BR>

  body: maybe Im being picky, but shouldnt it read. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hook&#40;comma&#41;Line
    &amp; Sinker&#34; <BR> <BR>They are three seperate objects, no? Unless you have
    some sort of hook-line. Going against what HD said, I don&#39;t think the use
    of a hook would be so bad. <BR> <BR>I think that there should definately be all
    three items, not just one. I do like the idea of a treble hook, as opposed to
    a single hook. Maybe a tear-drop sinker would work better than the double eyed
    sinker you have displayed here. <BR>as far as the item you have in the middle
    of the picture above, well that looks like a life-float-tube-thingy &#40;whatever
    those ar called&#41;. Make it look more like possible a bundle &#40;and I mean
    more of a neat, round -- maybe even tied off on the right and left side like they
    used to do -- bundle&#41;  <BR> <BR>With three abojects like this, you may experience
    a little visual instability, my suggestion around this is to reverse them out
    of boxes, similar to what you have here, but solid boxes. The boxes could be three
    different colors, that would work, but have the object reversed out &#40;being
    white&#41;. <BR> <BR>The small caps I dont care too much for. The H,L,S glyphs
    look much to heavy. I might suggest a loosely -- but not too loose -- letterspaced
    all caps line. <BR> <BR>The ornaments on either side of your type, really don&#39;t
    do aything for me. It&#39;s too distracting. <BR> <BR>The type face itself is
    really not bad. I am not totally crazy about the ampersand though, but then again,
    that may just be personal opinion. <BR> <BR>Oh, and whats the deal with that middle
    arm on the E? It looks like it is about to reach out and molest that R. ;&#41;

  body: wow thanks a lot everyone for all the comments/critisism. I have taken a lot
    of things said into consideration and decided to give it one more round to see
    if this design will hold any water... the line art is still not quite right, I
    will redraw it if i decide to stay with this concept, and change the line so it
    does not look so much like a life preserver &#40; i had a bad feeling it was going
    to read this way and was hoping someone would call me on it&#41;. Anyway, when
    i knock out the illustrations in white and keep the colors dark, it looks fairly
    decent in black and white &#40;the boxes become dark gray with knocked out white&#41;,
    so I dont think that this will end up being a problem.  <BR> <BR>Im still wondering
    about the type.. is it still too plain and boring? I used Poppl-Laudatio and modified
    it very slightly. I wasnt sure how far I should take the type.. any suggestions?

  body: Try an older style typeface if you&#39;re trying to keep the 30&#39;s feel.
    The line illustration doesn&#39;t work. You need the line to come off the spool
    to read as line. The Illustrations currently say hook, spool &amp; sinker. Remove
    the comma after line its not correct. And if its sinkers make sure your illustration
    is sinkers not sinker. Consider how this would be done in one color. I agree with
    Kyle loose the ornaments on either side of the name. Its coming along, keep posting

  body: Dan I have to disagree, but only a bit. I think that the name works as it
    is, minus one &#39;s&#39;. It works as a cliche and is used that way as well.
    For example, &#34;I fell for that face, hook, line and sinker.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jason,
    I think you need to distill this down even more. As it looks, you have vector
    art and raster art. What if, instead of using those three graphics as is, you
    redraw them yourself. Or, at least free them from those boxes. I&#39;m sad you
    are working with the scroll work. That is one of the things that could authenticate
    it a bit more. And the scroll work could also wrangle it all into one shape instead
    of several floating shapes. &#40;Maybe&#41; <BR> <BR>Crazy thought. What if the
    scroll work were the &#34;line&#34; and these three objects were some how &#34;on&#34;
    the line&#34;.... It is morning, I&#39;ll use that as an excuse if I decide later
    that this was a bad idea.

    of the logo - and it works great in black and white as it is.  However, you will
    need a solid background when dealing with possible embroidery on caps/shirts,
    some painted signage, vinyl signage needs, etc. as the distressed treatment will
    not translate successfully to all applications of the design. <BR> <BR>- Jeff

  body: 'Thanks a lot for the feedback Randy and Jeff. I will definetely take what
    you both said into consideration. Randy, yea I actually wasnt planning on using
    this Brunswick &#34;wannabe&#34; trademark, I just did a quick rough to see if
    i could make the style work for this project. I have plans of testing out different
    shapes/layouts, however due to time constraints of class &#40;teacher wants roughs
    for class in about 2 hours&#41; I am just working with what I have for now. I
    have made some very rough versions of how I envision the identity system to look.
    Its all 2 color &#40;exept for the business card which is 2/1&#41;. Here they

    was just stage one.. but i dont plan on this being the final... please make all
    the comments you want!  My teacher seems to just go along with everyone and my
    class is quiet so Im not getting a lot of feedback there.

  body: The blue border on the letterhead and other elements is a disaster waiting
    to happen. I&#39;ve been in and around printing for almost 30 years and I can
    tell you the cutting machines will never give you the same width border on your
    collateral. Also if a printer took on the job they charge you 100% to 200% overs
    to make the design work. It would cost a fortune. Also I know that some people
    who have standard holders for business cards will toss out a card that doesn&#39;t
    fit there filing system. Another potential problem is if you have to photocopy,
    lets say an invoice if the background is too dark it will be a problem. There
    are asthetic design problems and then there are real physical and monitary design
    problems. Dan

  body: dan- <BR>i guess i knew deep down inside that the border would not work. i
    was hoping i could get away with it because the current stores outdoor signage
    uses a thick border.. as do many of the vintage lure boxes. i will probably remove
    them eventually =&#41;  thanks for keeping me honest! <BR> <BR>as far as the invoice
    goes, i will be designing that at a later date and will take the issue of dark
    background into consideration.  <BR> <BR>the business card is about 3.5inches
    wide by 1.25 or so, i was told that as long as i kept it at 3.5 wide it would
    fit in card holders? i could be wrong, if i am, it would be good to know at this
    point =&#41; <BR> <BR>thanks again to everyone for all the valuable feedback,
    youve helped me turn this project around to a direction I am really enjoying.
    Makes me want to post all the projects im working on. heh. dont worry ill spare
    you that tho ;&#41;

  body: Jason - <BR> <BR>The pieces you have designed look great, but... <BR> <BR>Dan
    is correct about the issues of cost with your letterhead .  A printer would love
    to do such a job but in the &#34;real&#34; world it would cost a fortune to produce.  The
    envelope would also cause some printing issues and require a custom conversion
    - which again would be costly.  I&#39;m not sure it would realistic to expect
    a small client pay for such luxuries, unless the &#34;high-end&#34; look was a
    desired result. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also assuming that in creating other pieces,
    like an invoice, the design would take into consideration photocopying or faxing
    - and still fit into your complete corporate identity. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t buy
    into the the whole issue that a biz card MUST be 2 x 3.5.  Some of the most eye-catching
    and effective biz cards are unusual shapes and sizes.  Mine is almost square -
    and perhaps I do like to annoy some people with the unusual size/shape just a
    little bit.  These days a biz card seems to much more of  an introduction piece
    - and then the contact info is transferred to a PDA, a cell phone or a computer
    address book/data base.  Sticking to a standard size/format is just not the major
    concern it once was when designing a biz card. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve really enjoyed
    watching your progress on this project. <BR> <BR>- Jeff <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher <BR>Engineer

    VERY much improved over the initial rough thanks to all the comments. Some of
    the work is actually on display at the gallery of my school for the term. Once
    i get everything back i will have it photographed and upload a photo on here for
    you all to see. thanks again... ive learned so much from this website. keep it

  body: I ran across this looking for, well, I don&#39;t remember what I was looking
    for. Most likely something to do with aircraft design &#40;I&#39;m studying to
    be an aerospace engineer&#41;, but I was so awed with the progress on this design
    that I had to leave a comment. I though that first picture that was posted was
    really bland, but I saw it improve as I scrolled down, and the final one has such
    spirit to it. Very nice...
