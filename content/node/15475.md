body: Just out of curiosity... All you "Bezier Ranglers" out there, how many different
  typefaces do you typically work on at a time? One family or multiple designs?

  body: "I am currently working on 4 type families.  I worked on Leporello (6 weights
    and italic) for about a year.  It was my first text face and my first use of FontLab
    so I may not have been the most efficient worker.  I also have a full time job
    and a family so my type design is limited to a couple of hours a night and part
    of the weekend. The other 3 families I started just after coming back from TypeCon
    NY. One is fairly far along with 2 weights, small caps OSF, and CE; the other
    2 are just one weight  so far.  I had some ideas and had to get them down on disk
    before I burst. I am a peak and valley kind of guy.  I will probably have a downtime
    soon where I wont touch a glyph for a month or two.  I have no reason or plan
    for all this. It just comes out of me when it feels like it.\r\n\r\nSo how is

  body: I usually work on no fewer than a dozen designs at a time (I think I have
    about 20 in the works at present). Sometimes I get on a roll and can complete
    most of the major characters in a couple of consecutive sittings; sometimes I
    get stuck (or bored), and I find it helpful to move on to something else. With
    few exceptions, they are all VERY different typefaces.

  body: "It took me about 2.5 - 3 months. I redrew all the black weights since I was
    always unhappy with those. I also added lots of latin diacriticals, drew smallcaps
    and oldstyle figures for all the condensed and compressed fonts, (they previously
    only existed for the normal width fonts) and revised the kerning and spacing for
    the entire family. I also drew an alternate ampersand and legless lowercase l
    and made those accessable via the swash feature (there didn't seem to be any other
    way).\r\n\r\nI remember David Berlow telling an audience in NYC that in order
    to be a type designer you needed AED. Attention Excessive Disorder."

    I exert great willpower to not start working on another type family while one
    is still in the works. Since I have limited time for it, if I was working on multiple
    families I'd never get done.\r\n\r\nMy colleague/mentor Robert Slimbach usually
    has at least half a dozen families in the works at once. He'll work on one for
    a bit and then switch to another when he loses momentum.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "My projects tend to branch off in the exploratory/sketching phase.  I may
    sit down with one idea, and as I'm finishing up the basic charset, I realize how
    it could be different and set the first draft aside as I explore the other angles.
    \ Sometimes I take the tangents so far that I have to set <em>them</em> aside
    as completely different to-do projects. Depending on what these tangent explorations
    turn up, I may focus on one of them or set them all aside and return to the original
    draft.  (This is all in terms of text designs where the slightest variation could
    lead to a legitimately separate family.)\r\n\r\nADD, perhaps.  It makes for quite
    a few 'unfinished' designs, but I consider them my sketchbook as almost all of
    my work is done digitally.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I begin with a clear vision of the
    final product, I hammer out the basic charset in one sitting and focus on the
    adjustments over a few days until it's usable.  <a href=\"http://dilworthtypographics.com/portfolio.php?spec=vandermark\"
    target=\"_blank\">Vandermark</a> is a prime example of a leisure project that
    had my undivided attention for a string of weeknights.  I still have broader plans
    for variations, but I felt that the core concept is there as a single font.  Inasmuch
    as it has a full charset and kerning, and I'm sufficiently pleased with the look
    of things, it's a finished product.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to ask... when do you
    all consider a project 'finished?\"  When you can retail it?  When it has 8 or
    more weights?  When it doesn't crash your system when installed?  I have quite
    a few functioning fonts that are still under construction in my opinion."
