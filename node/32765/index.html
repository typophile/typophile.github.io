  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve attached a sample spread from my grad project (one part of it) it&rsquo;s a publication series that is composed of cultural ephemera from various &lsquo;island nations&rsquo;. This particular aspect is a sort of &lsquo;hub&rsquo; for the rest of the publication, it&rsquo;s a travel guide to these island nation / utopias.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten it to a stage where I am fairly happy, just wanted to hear from fresh eyes. There are a few things I am unsure about; how do are the page numbers / running heads working? are they not anchored enough? Is the line length for the marginalia too short? General comments about how it feels / navigates would be appreciated as well.</p>
<p>In case some more context is required; the finished book will be about 100 pages (50 islands for Volume 1) and the size is about half-letter (5.5 x 8.5). The typeface used is Galaxie Polaris by Chester &amp; Tracy Jenkins.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>On topic: I think your example does mimic a travel guide quite well.
Maybe it does look a bit &lsquo;serious&rsquo;, so to speak, but then again the lay-out is primarily to transfer information. However, maybe it could use a bit of flair, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Your use of colour is very nice, but it does feel a little sterile &ndash; you might want to think about using a sans with a touch more warmth and contrast to it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Agreement on the hyphenation.  The marginal texts' measures are just too short.</p>
<p>There are a few too many horizontal rules.  I kind of like them at the foot of the marginalia, but then again I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re necessary.  The rule at the end of the body text seems superfluous.</p>
<p>This is a tiny thing, but I&rsquo;d equalize the space before &amp; after the subheads' gray square bullet.  Or maybe even drop the bullet entirely and use an em space to separate the subhead from the text.</p>

<p>Quincunx: Yeah, I remember reading about San Serriffe a few years back, as for the &lsquo;seriousness&rsquo; I think I wanted to stick to that because the rest of the publication really diverges from the serious look. But I agree if this was all there was it could use more flair.</p>
<p>Linda Cunningham: I think I chose Galaxie Polaris because it has a very &lsquo;open&rsquo; feeling to it, I think it lends the page a nice balance. I did an initial version with an overt friendliness and warmth, but since the content verges from dreary to (perhaps) humourous I thought a touch of sterility would contrast with the content itself. If that makes any sense.</p>
<p>jslabovitz: Yes, superfluous is a fitting word, I&rsquo;ve been on the verge of taking it out for a while though, but you can never really convince yourself of some things till you hear it from someone else.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like it. It&rsquo;s very clean, which is perfect for a travel guide. I agree with Linda&rsquo;s comment about the sterility though. I might get yelled at for this, but I wonder what the blue sidebars would look like justified.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not in your initial question, but I feel like the image needs a compass rose or a marker for the capital. Although I like the simplified look, I think it&rsquo;s needs something more.</p>
<p>But I like it overall.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Absolutely, it needs some sort of directional indicator: not necessarily a full rose, but at least a &ldquo;North&rdquo; arrow would be useful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure detailing all the maps (assuming they are different) is beyond the time you can/need/want to spend, but some content there would be useful.</p>
<p>Justifying the sidebars really would be awkward &ndash; they&rsquo;re just too narrow.</p>
<p>To be honest, unless you&rsquo;re setting guide books like telephone books (with flimsy paper, minimal graphics, and totally jejune text), you really need some warmth in your text face.  It&rsquo;s late (for me), but offhand, both ITC Tiepolo and Poppl-Laudatio spring to mind&hellip;.</p>
