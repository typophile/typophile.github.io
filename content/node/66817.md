  body: "I think you hit it, based on that R, which is the LeGriffe R with the top
    of the stem 'amputated'. The 'z' is most heavily edited, and the 's' has had its
    tail grown, but all the letters look like they may have started as LeGriffe. The
    antiquing effect is one that has been described here before, as a Photoshop-sort
    of technique. \r\n\r\nI also noticed in looking for similar fonts that [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/poetica/regular/characters.html|Poetica]]
    has a huge variety of alternate glyphs that are not too far from LeGriffe's forms,
    if you wanted to start somewhere that might not need as much heavy editing.\r\n\r\n-
