  and I've recently been fooling around with the fonts the UI uses to display menus
  and title bars, etc. I think it's kind of nice to vary the look of my computer a
  bit, gives it some pizzazz.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm using Interstate, just for kicks.
  Anyone else change their system fonts?"

    font. Using it in a few apps, including instant messaging, email, and OS X itself.

  body: "A very interesting question. I've looked at this and am very happy that windows
    does allow OS font preferences, which is so contrary to the Mac's dire warning
    that changing the system font will destroy your performance. (I set windows to
    Interstate too, for a while.) \r\n\r\nIt leaves one wondering, if both companies
    'claim' to be responding to 'user desires', how is it that two totally different
    user species have developed. This is hardly the only case, with the respective
    browsers heading north and south on fonts relative to each other. \r\n\r\nIs it
    possible that humans divide their typographic desires so contrastingly along OS
    lines, as the vendors would have us believe. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: 'My take, working with UX designers (as they like to be called) is that more
    obstacles are being placed in the users path with respect to UI customization.
    I think this has to do with the increasing level of power that UX designers are
    able to exert - they are able to make the case that user font choice will break
    their UI. They can perhaps point to increased support costs and increased testing
    matrix required when you allow user-font choice in UI. Case in point being the
    iPhone, maybe? '

    designed by Matthew Carter and hinted by Tom Rickner for Microsoft as [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=1470|a
    UI font for handhelds]]. It squeezes in more character per inch than its close
    relatives, Tahoma and Verdana, without sacrificing their legibility at small sizes.
    At FontMarketplace.com, a single-user license for Nina is $4.99 per font or $17.99

  body: "\"Seems natural.\"\r\nlol! There is nothing natural, to me, about being compelled
    to make the choice of choice at the purchase of the OS. Maybe we have different
    natures. I, like many before me and you (most likely), don't, naturally, take
    tools and use them as they are, favoring tailoring to our own needs, uses and
    environments. (Looking around at the millions and millions of wheels, don't you
    wonder what lazy genius invented that stupid phrase about reinvention?)\r\n\r\n\"Case
    in point being the iPhone, maybe?\"\r\nThe iPhone seems to me an extension of
    the Apple philosophy of no design taste is design, i.e. a clean, clear, blank,
    is better than taste. I think this's been imported from British design over the
    last decade plus. The first Mac, the Newton, the work stations, all Apple's previous
    products had personality in appearance. The customized Garamond Apple used, was
    the typographic embodiment of that old look. \r\n\r\nHelvetica is the typographic
    embodiment of the blank look... except if the size/resolution combination fails
    in a given size, then mash it (?), or head to a Myriad that works for a slightly
    different blank look. This is fine specific to Apple's design, don't get me wrong,
    'How much personality can a mass-produced hand-held device allow?' is an evolving
    door. But, to enforce that philosophy on work stations, laptops, and presentations,
    which I feel are closer in use and appearance to furniture than to a phone is,
    I think, a misconstrued semi-infinite loop, naturally.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I used to be a fan of UI modification in the pre-MacOS X days. There was
    a program called Kaleidoscope that let you completely change the look of the Mac
    UI. It was a lot of fun, but eventually I realized it was little more than a distraction,
    a way to avoid doing real work. The UI was fine the way it was and all those themes
    were only skin deep--it didn't change or improve anything fundamental in the way
    the UI worked. It actually made things worse: A good UI should be invisible, and
    putting a new skin on it makes it visible, at least until you get used to it,
    and becomes invisible again. Until you go to a different computer with a different
    theme.\r\n\r\nI feel the same about system UI fonts in OS X. I'm not crazy about
    them, but they do the job adequately and don't call attention to themselves, which
    is as it should be."
