  You can see a version using an altered version of Galaxie Cassiopeia. I really like
  this version but I need a little bit more \"italic\" or tiltet... I have already
  tried Cocktail Shaker, Bello and Mousse Script but they are not really \"straight\"...
  Do you have any suggestions?? Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amie_5796.jpg]"
