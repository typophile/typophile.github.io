  body: "This lettering has a rare unicase structure, similar to Monopol, which uses
    an uppercase W together with lowercase letters that resemble the image. You could
    adapt Monopol SemiBold. Get the correct proportions by extending the letters vertically.
    Get _r_ by using an _n_ with 2/3 of the rhs leg clipped. Revise W by clipping
    the overlap and extending vertex to X-height. Minor tinkering with t.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/monopol/\r\nIf
    there is a font that matches I trust someone will mention it.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Any of Don or Ryuk's suggestions improve upon that awful 'w'. It dissuades
    me from even trying to find the original font.
