Yes, this is a self-serving plug, and the fonts kind of suck, but cut me some slack; these are among the first fonts I ever designed, from many years ago. It's nice to see that trendyness has caught up with them.</div>

If you really want to know what's in, go to the mall. See what's on book covers, in magazines, on posters in shop windows, and screened onto t-shirts. Keep in mind that font trends vary by region. I just flew back in from Arizona, and I think about half the type in local magazines had been set in script faces—mostly Zapfino—and people out there are still carving new metal letters in Papyrus, as opposed to here in DC where it's just the font for the bottom feeders lately.

Yes—although there is a strong tendency for those nations to pick things up from each other since there's almost no language barrier. But there will also be trends that get into both nations simultaneously simply because so many consumer products are sold in both nations.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rounded type is coming back slowly, but for it to work it has to sneak it's way via general use as an alternative to sticking Helvetica on everything. I don't think that we'll see it make a big comeback as a large-size display face like it was in the 60s and 70s, and I think it will be confined to AG, Arial, and Helvetica rounded. Frankfurter is just too over the top to get really big, and VAG Rounded seems likely to be avoided because of its connection to Volkswagen advertising.

		<div class="commentbody">Needless to say that some things never go out of style. I've seen a lot of "Helvetica bashing" on this site, but in all honesty I admire it for what it is. Its timeless design, legibility & many styles make it the perfect font. While having been designed in 1957 (if I'm not mistaking), it still works in modern advertisements. For anyone in the designing business it might look a bit out of date, but I think that's mainly due to overuse & not to its appearance. Its a multifunctional font & that's something to admire regards of whether you like it or not.</div>
