  body: "Close, but ...   Din has square tittles, the sample's are round;  the a looks
    slightly different (but more like the one in FF Din). The numbers in the sample
    have been fiddled with and so are inconclusive - they're different sizes and they've
    been raised and lowered.\r\n\r\nTaking a second look, this seems to be lettering
    that's been applied to glass door or office identification frame, and so may have
    been customized with those minor alterations (it's pretty easy to rub on a circle
    instead of a square!)\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of different implementations
    of Din from quite a few different foundries, this could be one of the others.,
    but I couldn't find any with round tittles. There are also a lot of Din-based
    fonts without \"Din\" in their names.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n"
