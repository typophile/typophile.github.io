body: "City along the Rhine in [[Germany]], at the confluence of the river Main.\r\n\r\n[[Johann
  Gutenberg]] was born here (or nearby), and was a citizen of the city. Sometime after
  his return from Strasbourg in the 1440s, he began producing and distributing printed
  books. He is credited with inventing western printing with movable type in Mainz,
  but whether the technology was actually created their, in Strasbourg, or elsewhere
  is not known. Gutenberg also had a workshop in Frankfurt, and later in Eltville,
  where he died in the later 1460s.\r\n\r\nThere is a magnificent museum in Mainz,
  which chronicles the history of printing. It is fittingly named the [[Gutenberg
  Museum]].\r\n\r\nThere is a publishing house there called the [[Verlag Hermann Schmidt]],
  which makes nice typography books."
