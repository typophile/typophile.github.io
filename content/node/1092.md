  know what I&#39;m doing, I&#39;ll post a little sum&#39;n sum&#39;n I&#39;ve been
  working on. This was built entirely in <a href="http://www.font.to/cgibin/at.cgi?a=227536">Bitfonter

    but . . . One thought: I think either you should also notch the shoulder of the
    &#39;h&#39;, or else remove the &#34;underarm&#34; pixel. That stem-arch joint
    just seems too solid. <BR> <BR>-- K.'

  body: I think the only glyphs that don&#39;t work are those with too <BR>many traps,
    like the &#39;o&#39; and &#39;e&#39;. What happens if you only <BR>do two corners
    &#40;on opposite ends&#41;? It&#39;s really nice, Jared. <BR> <BR>&#39;g&#39;
    seems a bit wide. Maybe reign in the bottom half <BR>one pixel from the left.

  body: Yeah, it&#39;s very good, imo, nice work. <BR> <BR>Like best, the lc y and
    g, but all of them grab your attention. <BR> <BR>It seems to me that pixel display
    &#40;bigger than 8 or 9 px&#41; <BR>is a niche that is not being fully served
    and it&#39;d be nice to <BR>see more faces like this. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: Hi Jared, <BR> <BR>Nice font specimen. I think that the tails of f, g and
    y are too decorative. I like the optical internal greys, looks great. BTW, I want
    to buy a Bitfonter that can produce pixel fonts optimised for flash, and maybe
    a new version who can generate super pixel fonts, vector with greys. I am a windows
    user, but if bitfonter can offer a new version for those who design pixelfonts...it
    would be great! I never knew if Bitfonter was a sucess of sales for Pyrus anyway..

    <BR> <BR>I like those tails Jared, but they do look a bit out of context with
    the rest of the face. Perhaps you could derive two versions of the characters:
    one that is a straighter gothic sans; and one that is more decorative - sort of
    a sans w/swash lowercase. <BR> <BR>Or, whatever. <BR> <BR>Regardless, it looks
    swell.'

  body: 'Has it been 72 hours? I really can&#39;t hold it in any more...  ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I personally like large pixelfonts in general, not least because there
    are so few of them! This is a strange one &#40;in a good way&#41;, and the main
    question about it seems to be: what&#39;s it for? <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s for good
    performance in video, then the trapping is going to look strange versus &#34;display&#34;
    usage, but OK functionally. So if you&#39;re shooting for the former, you&#39;ll
    have to put in more traps &#40;like in the &#34;I&#34; - yes, I can see the trickiness
    there&#41;, but if it&#39;s for the latter you&#39;d probably need to balance
    them aesthetically &#40;generally by reducing the trapping in some glyphs&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>As to the somewhat unorthodox glyphs &#40;like the &#34;g&#34; and &#34;y&#34;&#41;,
    I honestly can&#39;t figure out if they should stay or go... One thing about the
    &#34;g&#34; though: it&#39;s too wide, and leaning rightward - try to make the
    join to the tail thinner and within the left bound of the head. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    posting and will post another sample later this week when I get a window of time.

  body: The starstruck g and y are fine to my eye, maybe because they look great from
    5 feet away. A fitter quote might go, &#34;Pixeltrap attains its shape at a distance
    of 5&#39;, or 120 dpi, whichever comes first.&#34; <BR> <BR>I am not teasing.
    Photonic analog interference is wild and real between the viewer and the display.
    Only those with digital eyes will see strange lighttraps. <BR>&#60;self-serving&#62;
    maybe some of them want to be gray. &#60;/sans&#62;
