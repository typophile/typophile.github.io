body: "Rookie question here. What is the value of glyphs like the Grave, Tilde, Acute,
  etc. when modern typesetting tools feature glyphs like Agrave, Atilde, and Aacute?\r\n\r\nI've
  read that designing the individual \"accent\" glyphs for the purpose of generating
  all relevant \"accented\" glyphs is a timesaving strategy inside Fontlab. But, aside
  from that, why bother designing the individual \"accent\" glyphs at all? Does anyone
  really use them anymore?\r\n\r\n\r\nTyler"

    use with letters, some mathematical, linguistic or other notation might use it.
    Sorry for not really answering your question, but I do hope better informed people
    will say something.\r\n\r\nAlso, these accent glyphs are easily available from
    most keyboards ^`\xB4~\xA8 and you don't want to leave users wondering why it
    doesn't work on your font but does on others..."
