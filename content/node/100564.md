body: "Hey everyone!\r\n\r\nHas anyone noticed that it is difficult to set body text
  in Soho Regular?\r\n\r\nFor me Regular it seems a bit to dark, whereas Light does
  the job much better. Also, probably due to the large x-height the Auto leading value
  of 120% is way too tight. Although, I think the large x-height is also responsible
  for high legibility and readability in small sizes, which is a good thing.\r\n\r\nMy
  own experimentation led me to a decision of using Soho Light 7.5/11.5 pt or 8/12
  pt for body text. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any experience working with this typeface?
  Any comments/tips?"

    text - as long as it's loose enough. But if you have to track it looser to work,
    the font needs to be fixed (because \"boundary conditions\", like the right side
    of the \"r\" will go wrong).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
