  body: 'I think of Typophile as one of the best procrastination techniques ever developed.
    And I consider procrastination to be an important part of the design process:
    I get most of my best ideas while I''m procrastinating. It really is much more
    productive than sitting looking at a blank screen or piece of paper trying to
    come up with an idea on the spot.'
