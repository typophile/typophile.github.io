  I selected Helvetica as a standard font & on most sites I don't have any problem...
  On Google however (which -if I'm not mistaken- uses Arial, I get the following screen...\r\nDoes
  anyone know what happened & most of all how to solve it?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!"

    will take the next installed font... in alphabetical order. It's kind of strange
    though, since Google specifies the general sans serif if Arial isn't installed,
    and in your case that should be Helvetica.\r\n\r\nArial is actually kind of nice
    on-screen, abominable as it may be in print. Just goes to show how different online
    and print design really is."

  body: "It is installed & I already checked Google's altenative for Arial as well.\r\nStrangely
    enough, the font that appears on Google is nowhere to be found on my computer
    (I ran through the entire list trying to identify it, but without succes).\r\nMaybe
    re-installing OS X might clear things up."

  body: Ill Sans, you probably have some corrupt font caches. Try deleting them with
    FontFinagler or any such utility.
