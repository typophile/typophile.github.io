  think it would be cool if Typophile handled images a little differently, where if
  you have a wide image it could be clicked on to expand. Look at the forums at http://www.dpreview.com
  (Photo website) Images are previewed at a certain width but can be expanded if you
  click on it, so you don't have a scroll bar. I think this would be the cats pajamas.
  I don't know what that means but I think it's good. "
