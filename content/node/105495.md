    half-hourglass-half-cat ampersand and sloppy vertical alignment make it very attractive.
    Does anyone spot a /U/? I wonder how it was distinguished from the plastic-cup
    /V/."

    have access to my specimen books. I believe it would be in either the 1923 ATF
    or the Barhardt Brothers & Spindler ca. 1925.\r\n\r\nSorry, I won\u2019t be home
    until after TypeCon. But maybe this lead will be helpful."

    have been called \u201CNovelty Gothic\u201D (or something like that) by BB&S.
    But my memory could be completely off base."

  body: "I was wondering if Tom Wilkes might be available to answer the question,
    but alas, he died 4 years ago. He was also the creator of Dave Mason's first solo
    album, <em>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alone_Together_(Dave_Mason_album)|Alone
    Together]]</em>, which featured an elaborate die-cut foldout on the sleeve and
    a disc made of swirling multicolored vinyl rather than the usual black. Whoa,
    I think I just had a flashback!\r\n"

  body: The lower case is not as successful as the upper, as some of the characters
    are stiff by comparison. I guess the challenge of doing a lower case to match
    the 1890 version successfully is still open.
