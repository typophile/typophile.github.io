    curious to see j, k, w, x, y, z in both."

  body: "Hi bekir. Both faces look well crafted and well thought out. The typographic
    design is good too. The first one (do they have names yet?) is too closely spaced
    for text setting. The second one also requires some tracking out to make it more
    readable in a text setting. That is not to say you should increase all your side
    bearings. If you are using Fontlab you can create a simple internal tracking program
    using positioning commands which users can switch on and off as an OpenType feature.\r\n\r\nBoth
    fonts have a basic challenge ahead if you intend to release them for retail sale.
    Lots and lots of competitors. The first one in particular, a lot of that sort
    of thing has been done over the past decade. The second face is quite similar
    to a number of existing types.\r\n\r\n<em>In the second one, C looks too condensed.</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    is a bit on the narrow side as far as the width goes, but this anomaly is not
    extreme enuff to be of concern. The C is not terribly distracting and does not
    compromize the color. Making it wider will affect color more, so I recommend leaving
    it as it is.\r\n\r\n<em>Am curious to see j, k, w, x, y, z in both.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    choice of Geeking Latin text is one of the silliest things type designers & typographers
    do. No offense to those who use it, but really, why use Latin text when it leaves
    out so many letters of the Latin alphabets we use, and gives no comprehensible
    clues about how your font performs with regard to linguistics?\r\n\r\nYou're better
    off setting samples in languages currently in use such as English or Turkish.
    The traditional typo-cred inferred by retro Latin samples is one thing, and practical
    useful testing methods are something else.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: In "Kiriscan Capital", the parentheses are much too shallow; it's hard to
    distinguish the left parenthesis from the right parenthesis without looking closely.
    I like the structure of the ampersand very much, but the end that tapers to a
    point is completely out of place.
