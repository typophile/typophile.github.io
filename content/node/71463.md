  body: "There's room for a good experiment there. If it were me I would try to do
    it mathematically, then do it again with what \"feels\" right. I'd need to define
    of \"feel\" though.\r\n\r\nDoing an entire family would take too long to be practical.
    Easier to focus on a few letter-strings. To avoid practice effects and untoward
    effects of order, the order of glyphs and with method of letter spacing would
    have to be carefully counterbalanced.\r\n\r\nGetting other expert type designers
    to do the same letter spacing task would produce more materials.\r\n\r\nFollowing
    this a \"can you see the difference?\" test of sorts would be very telling. I
    would run this portion on normals, not typographers, and do my best to keep them
    uninformed. Other measures such as preference or visual search could be established
    depending on your goal. \r\n\r\nI would make all judgments on paper due to fidelity.\r\n\r\nDesigning
    a complete experiment would take some time, but a fun one to think about for sure."

  body: 'The problem with the "ruler" is you have to know what you are measuring for.
    Almost every single letter in fonts regarded as excellent have what are sometimes
    called "optical corrections"--meaning that in order to look "right" or good geometric
    simplicity and uniformity has to be departed from. As Nick says, sometimes what
    you need is uniformity, and then using a ruler helps. For example overshoots and
    stems are usually pretty uniform. However, even there, there are exceptions where
    uniformity is not desirable.  '

    \u2014 W.A. Dwiggins and C.H. Griffith had some correspondence debating this topic
    70 years ago. Dwiggins always felt that there must be some kind of mathematical
    formula that would allow the quick arrival at optimal spacing for a given weight
    of design and was frustrated at the iterative process. Griffith maintained that
    the eye must be the final arbiter. I spoke on this topic at the 2003 ATypI conference."

    under the watch and guidance of Griffith. Dwiggins would frequently indicate on
    his \u201Cthin paper\u201D drawings some starting values for sidebearings, as
    he saw it. But these might or might not be the final values at the end of the
    fitting process. Final decisions were made from printed proofs: it either looked
    good or it did not. (And if it did not, then the degree of dissatisfaction would
    sometimes have to be weighed against the costs and efforts of recutting.)\r\n\r\nThe

    at, such as finding the centre of something, for example, and others that are
    less good, like horizontal, vertical and perpendicular lines in my own experience.
    It would be interesting to know which functions relate to our genetic heritage

    exercise, to maintain the faculty.\r\nIt is debilitating to rely overly on mechanical
    aids.\r\n\r\nHowever, the human body is not built for routine (that would be an
    adaptive disaster, an inability to cope with the unexpected).\r\nSo taste should
    not be allowed to ossify.\r\nAt the simplest physiological level, this becomes
    apparent after one has been working for several hours on an italic, whereupon
    an inspection of roman letter forms reveals that they have mysteriously acquired
    a backward slant.\r\n\r\nThat's why I check the glyphs I'm drawing by flipping
    them, and FontLab obliges with a little button in the Metrics panel which performs
    this task."

    is both a program\u2014and hence a mathematically based algorithm\u2014and a service,

    designer. Other automatic spacing programs include the original HZ program, and
    its development into the \"optical\" spacing program of Adobe. Designers generally
    think none of the automatic kerning programs capture what the eye can do, though

    fonts. Some of these were connecting scripts and I was shocked at how inconsistent
    and badly aligned the letter-to-letter connections were. It was clear to me that
    the samples were set in InDesign with "optical" spacing enabled. If a professional
    graphic design magazine (in an article about type, no less) can make such a blunder,
    I think we would be better off without it. At least they could move it to a submenu
    of a submenu of a tiny pop-up menu in the corner of a tool bar or something. It
    seems to have done the trick for advanced OpenType features.
