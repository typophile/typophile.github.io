  one in row I kerned for an font family.\r\nBeside it, there is Light, Regular, SemiBold,
  Bold and ExtraBold.\r\nAll weights have same UPM, same values for ascender, descender,
  Caps height, x-height... everything is same in all weights from field Font Info
  > Metrics and Dimensions!\r\n\r\nFor some reason unknown to me (this happens the
  first time), ExtraBold is displayed like it's done in ~1500 UPM, bigger, with top
  part of glyphs cut off. While other weights look normally, as it should!\r\n\r\nWhen
  I install ExtraBold and try it in Illustrator, Photoshop, Word... it matches with
  the rest of weights, so no any visual difference (in height, position or anything
  like that).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what might be the reason for this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nScreenshot
  attached.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScreenShot032_6447.png]"
