body: This is the italic used by the Doves Press in the early 20th century in conjunction
  with its own roman, and was referenced in a book as "Miller and Richard's Old Style
  italic."  Is there an available digital face that's close?

    Style No. 7</a> are in the same genre but a little later. <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-Tx7vvy">Century
    Old Style</a> is a descendant. None of these are as heavy or as steeply slanted,
    so these are about as close as you can get. I don''t think there is a digital
    cut of M&R''s Old Style. '
