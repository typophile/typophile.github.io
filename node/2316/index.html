Whoever designed it kept in mind the immediacy that a shirt of this kind needs and the importance of making it print friendly. The design isn't too big, nor doesn't it have a lot of important detail and it smartly uses the two or three colors afforded. There are a few other excellent designs that have also been made with these things in mind.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe we should have a contest to guess how old Hrant is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree, David. I think people forget that design is meant to be the bridge between message and audience. It is meant to craft the medium in an effort to facilitate or focus understanding. By putting design ahead of the message (such is the case with the &quot;typop&quot; submissions as well as many others) meaning is essentially subverted. In these instances we're really talking about decoration and not design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you guys are analyzing this too much. For what reason, I'm not sure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typop is just a clever shortening of typophile, and the 'Pop' part finds echoes in Pop Culture, Sub Pop records (nirvana's original label), Yum Pop clothing (hypercute japanese flava), and of course, Pop Tarts breakfast treats. Pop is just a cool word. It pops. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are Tshirts, c'mon now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->People aren't going to see a shirt with a website address printed on it and sprint to their browsers. We have a highly specialized auidence What this is more about is finding a Tshirt that *we* will REALLY ACTUALLY BUY, something we wouldn't be ashamed to wear because it is, for lack of a better word, cool. BUYING the judge's choice helps ensure that typophile is still here in five years. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My favorite so far is 18.008/ and I like Typop, but if I was submitting it to this contest, I'd flip the 'o' and lose the little boy icon in favor of something more typographic &ndash; remember *who* is judging. I think they are all over 30. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, Jared/Joe, the contestants need to know how revisions and variations are viewed by the judges. Could Typop variations and revisions have the effect of splitting his own votes? (I'm assuming 'he' because I saw the little boy icon on his website a while back.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are the revisions 'swapped out' for the originals when it's time to judge? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are the judges under the impression that Tshirt colors are flexible, thus picking the *design* they like best, regardless of Tshirt color and design colorway? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bj</div>

Until about two weeks ago I didn't even know about this site so both words would  mean absolutely  nothing to me. I would have exactly the same curiosity about a shirt that spelled Typop or Typophile. As long as the design has a good concept behind it, catches somebody's eye and springs curiosity the person will come to visit this site and maybe buy a shirt whether the shirt spells Typophile, Typop, Typhopile, Typhileop, etc&hellip;</div>

<li>Hrant, maybe this is rhetoric, but why must you continue to rabble rouse? If you don't like the fact that nobody has commented positively on your designs, then do something better. It seems that you are trying to harm the process, a process that doesn't care much for the designs you have submitted. Are the two related?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you care about Typophile, specifically, or is this 'just another forum' to you? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should care.

Do you really believe otherwise? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want to try to hyperanalyze every pixel and find sinister motives, then that's your choice. That's what these forums are for.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey guys and gals. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was one of those dot com casualties. I thought I was going with a good thing and now I'm doing side work to stay afloat. I am working on several designs for this competition. I hope to win like everyone else. The money could come in handy too. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I disagree with Tim Lee who said whoever wins is not that important. Why should some one enter this competition. I saw all the designs. Some people don't care it seems if they win or lose. I would have put the names on thse inital posts. That way you would have more quality over quantity. People wouldnt put their name on some of the designs. I dont exactly know how to capture the essence of typophile. Its a forum to discuss type and design. There are a lot of those on the internet. I'm unsure about what the judges are looking for. Some of them are type designers so the type should be topnotch. NOt Arial or Times. I agree with Joe Pemberton that putting a dot com on a shirt (like <a href="http://www.dotcom.com">www.dotcom.com</a>) is so &quot;three years ago&quot; Every one three years ago was proudly wearing their dot bomb shirts on casual Fridays and weekends. It was a big joke if you ask me. People walking into the grocery store wearing their dot bomb shirts. It was like showing off. Now you wouldnt be caught dead wearing a dot bomb shirt. As for people visiting the site. I don't think non-designers give a whip. But every designer should at least stop by. That would be my target demographic. Especially a lot of these web designers who track Arial or Helvetica tight and think that is design. Then if you are at a party with other web designers then I would wear it. If it was a party with the regular population I wouldn't wear it. I think if the winning design is reeeeeely good then people would approach and say nice shirt buddy but I dont think theyd pull out a pen and write down <a href="http://www.typophile.com">www.typophile.com</a> and then get home and check it out first thing. Thats a stretch. I think peoplemake fun of any shirt now that says <a href="http://www.something.com">www.something.com</a>. Do I haaaaave to do that  I look foward to seeing my designs posted. It seems like theres a huge backlog. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ciao, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dave</div>
