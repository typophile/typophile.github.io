body: "So I've been putting some serious hours into Typophile these days. Even on
  the days where I get some 'real' work done at the office, I come home and hack away
  to the wee hours of the morning. Sad, sad, sad\u2014but oh so fun. It sounds like
  most people are liking what they see so far. Of course there are still some serious
  gaps. Image uploads for comments for example, are still missing, and inline display
  of image attachments needs to be addressed. Right now the primary concern is some
  server performance issues. Now that we've made it through the initial trampling
  at launch, we've been able to make a few tweeks and optimizations to speed things
  up a little, but we've got a ways to go before the site is snappy and crisp like
  we like it.\r\n\r\nThe most problematic areas right now are the forum listing pages.
  There are some pretty gnarly database queries there that are really gobbling processor
  cycles. As soon as we start caching some of those queries we should see a pretty
  good boost in speed.\r\n\r\nThen there are the mysteriously absent moderator posts:
  somehow the import script I wrote decided that the moderator posts weren't that
  important and ignored them completely. Needless to say, Stephen is <a href='http://typophile.com/node/12063?from=100&comments_per_page=50#comment-71355'>pretty
  sad</a>. Don't worry, though. They aren't dead, just sleeping. They'll be back shortly.\r\n\r\nOf
  course, there are quite a few features in the wings, not the least of which is a
  'Google' style search with sweet +-\"\" etc. operators. For now, though, I'm going
  to sleep."

    ;^) Great work. Love the new site already.\r\n\r\nChristian, not sure what Stephen
    means. Unless I wasn't really a moderator before. All of my posts still exist.
