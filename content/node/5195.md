  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38176.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I need
  to identify the symbols used in a book called The Golden Key.  The text&#39;s fonts
  are Bell MT Regular and Bell MT Italic.  I don&#39;t have a scanner, so I used my
  cell phone&#39;s camera to capture the two symbols found in the book.  Would you
  please tell me where I can acquire the softcopies of the symbols.  <BR> <BR>Thanks
  a lot.
