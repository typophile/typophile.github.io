  & Frere-Jones...\r\nI'm trying to recreate a vintage concert poster, which features
  many weights and widths of classic gothic sans serifs, and am hoping to find something
  with a large selection of widths and weights like Knockout...\r\nI love Knockout,
  just trying to see if I can find something more unique...\r\nThanks!\r\nJames"

  body: "I'm not sure it's what you're looking for, but I love the effect of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/|Monotype
    Grotesque]] - it has this terrific misshapenness I find sort of wacky and entertaining.
    It seems very sixties to me (I'm British) since while it's much older Gill Sans
    totally eclipsed it in the thirties and forties until it came back into fashion
    around then. The [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/bold-extended/|bold
    extended weight]] is perhaps the wildest, but it has lots of styles. \r\n\r\nStephen
    Coles' [[http://fontfeed.com/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/|list
    of Helvetica alternatives]], which I found it on, is probably worth checking through
    for other options. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/modernica/|Modernica]]
    is also rather lovable, though it lacks condensed/extended versions. "
