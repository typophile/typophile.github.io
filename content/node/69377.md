  body: "I like the way the yoots spk! But, being from London i revel in how many
    dialects fit inside a few postcodes. You can pretty accurately guess where someone
    is from...within a compass direction at least. Apparently back in the day you
    can get it down to the street.\r\n\r\nI read a book recently by Stephen Pinker
    who was talking about a report from america, and the black american english dialect
    that evolved there. and despite reputation or perception it's a full dialect,
    with strict grammatical rules, syntax and emphasis. So maybe the kids ain't so
    wrong....\r\n\r\ndamn funny cartoon too."
