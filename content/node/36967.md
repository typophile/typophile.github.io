  body: thanks. we're trying to decide what is "appropriate" too. our old logo is
    quite similar to the one on the top here. we're ready for a change, but don't
    know if the script is too feminine.

  body: "Although I do like the script, I feel like it is pretty trendy right now,
    and am partial to the top example. It feels a bit more intelligent and calculated
    to me \u2013 the others simply do not read as being finished to me."

  body: "These are all pretty solid designs, but none of them are \"wow\". With a
    name like lift, I think the design has potential to be a bit more clever.\r\n\r\nTry
    #3 with a black dot over the 'i', and add the blue dot at the end of the word,
    raised as if the 't' is \"lifting\" it.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    For a challenge. ;o)

    interchangeably. For a challenge. ;o)</em>\r\n\r\nThis is actually what we were
    wanting to do from the start so maybe that's the way we'll go. \r\n\r\n<em>Try
    #3 with a black dot over the \u2019i\u2019, and add the blue dot at the end of
    the word, raised as if the \u2019t\u2019 is \u201Clifting\u201D it.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    like this idea; it helps the design to be a bit more clever and enhances the playfullness.\r\n\r\nWe
    also found that the \"T\" on the top logo looked a bit like a propaganda'ish hammer,
    which has some possibilities with the build side of things that we do."

  body: The name came from the desire to "elevate" or "enhance" the presence and identities
    of our clients. We were also fascinated by the force of lift that is involved
    in flight.

    makes the script more relevant. I was thinking heavy-equipment before."

  body: I think the script is not too femme. I would move the dot on the i slightly
    to the right - also it feels like it's bending the wrong way. I might make it
    bigger too. Loose the colored dot ideas. They read as mid-90's ideas. What about
    adding some muscle/weight to the script version? As in heavy lifting?

    to go upwards to make the feeling of things getting lifted... going up...

    could be raised a bit.

  body: I don't know if the script is a font, but the 'f' is way too heavy. Or the
    'l', 'i' and 't' are too light, of course.
