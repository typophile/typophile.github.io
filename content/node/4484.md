  body: Anton, though it&#39;s not impossible we might find a &#40;close&#41;  <BR>match
    for this typeface, please keep in mind that the  <BR>vast majority of posters
    were hand lettered in those days.

    familiar also. <BR> <BR>

  body: I hunted through the Jaspert &#34;Encyclopaedia&#34; and about the only typeface
    that made me look twice at it was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/albertus/"
    target="_blank">Albertus</a>, and it&#39;s not too close. I guess if I had to
    try to re-create this, that might be where I would start. The high-centered M
    with straight sides is not very common at all in serif fonts.

  body: The typeface this reminds me most of is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-benguiat/">Benguiat</a>,
    probably because of the distinctive M. But Benguiat isn&#39;t really that close....
