  Arial Type Battle</a>]\r\n\r\nI was casting around on a client project for a sans
  where I could modify the n & m to match the geometric look of the logo (stemless)
  for their identity package. The project gave me an excuse to tinker on the Arial
  alphabet. Here's the lc (with alt n m) and a text setting:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arial_client_3884.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arial_client2_5155.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  don't expect this to go further anytime soon. There's just enough to meet the deadline
  for the stationary package."

    in the "r"? What are those little protrusions called, by the way?

    to be done. If you finish this, you will have to be sure to leave the word \"arial\"
    out of the title. This is wholly new and fresh, yet nicely references the challenger.\r\n\r\nevan\r\n<a

  body: "I like that k form too. I think I originally got the idea from Walbaum, and
    originally implemented it in one of my first efforts to draw a workable font.
    It took me a while to find, but it dates way back to the dawn of Typophile, and
    my type journey. *Warning* the following link contains graphic images of font
    brutality:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/110\r\n\r\nIt played a bit part in a Typecon
    presentation in 2004, and there was some distinct snickering when the title went
    up. *sniff* Hehe. It is good to look back and see some progress.\r\n\r\nEdit for
    Nachos: It reads, but looks off balance, especially at the end of a word like
    \"butter\" ie round+stemless-r. The more the stemlessness goes in, the less workable
    in text. Dax and others counter this by injecting a corner for the missing stem.
    That allows them to bring the feature into the r,u,b,d,p,q etc. "

  body: Very nice dude. In response to macursus I think we SHOULD call it "Arial",
    that way they might be forced to stick that pig of a type travesty and make way
    for a better animal. IMAGINE! Positive connotations attached to the word "Arial"
    haha Ah, who am I kidding macursus it'll never work. Let's just cut our losses
    and focus on better work.

  body: "Not to me \u2014 I immediately think the opposite. The letterforms were not
    designed for legibility, and it shows. The superhinted screen rendering is nowhere
    near the legibility of, for example, Verdana. One needs the more open counters
    of a humanist sans design.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think I like what Randy did here.
    The corner treatment feels like overexposed phototype, and combines with the missing
    stems to yield an interesting retro-futuristic feeling. (Having not gone back
    to re-read the whole thread, probably somebody else already said that....)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comments. I think Arial is well hinted as rui abreu mentions,
    but also that the design is not as effective as other options for long stretches
    of running text, per Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe forms do have a benefit:\r\nI recently
    watched the Helvetica film, and one comment sticks with me (I forget who it was).
    They were saying that all the letters in Helvetica feel like they are set in concrete
    when next to each other. It is down to the closed forms, and vertical stress with
    low contrast IMO. There is massive lockup for almost all letter combinations.
    This stability results in fonts well suited for making logos and setting headlines.
    Sounds like a recipe for overexposure and dulled creativity, which I think is
    the root of most people's issues with the genre. \r\n\r\nHowever, as I said in
    the main post, this project has shed a positive light on both Helvetica and Arial
    for me. Whenever I've tried to improve something I perceive as lacking, the result
    is that I esteem it more.\r\n"
