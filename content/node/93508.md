  has not chosen to look at one of the thousand or so independent designers contributing
  to their site, but instead they have chosen to highlight one of their own designers
  - Steve Matteson.\r\n\r\nA disappointing first step by the new owners."

  body: "@Janic. What do you imagine the process to be behind such a decision? More
    importantly, without a true understanding of that decision making process, without
    complete transparency, why would any other choice have been more or less partisan?\r\n\r\nI
    attended a talk given by Steve earlier this year in New York and was impressed
    by his passion, focus and attention to aspects of type design and both traditional
    and digital typography. I understand your inferred bias but agree with both James
    and hrant that his hard work, passion and contributions to the world of fonts
    and typography merit that distinction."

  body: "@hrant \r\n@Karl\r\nI think you have completely missed the point here. I
    have nothing but the greatest respect for Steve but for Monotype to choose to
    use an information channel of a company that 'supports' thousands of fantastic
    new and young designers for their own promotion is not a very intelligent way
    of the new company showing their support.\r\nJ"

  body: "Janic - On the contrary, as the new player in the MyFonts game, I would immediately
    promote one of our own bright lights. This shows that yes, we have something positive
    to bring to the game. Makes positive business and marketing sense.  Myfonts has
    always promoted both new and experienced designers. Just go back and review the
    Myfonts News - every month they highlight a rising stars in one issue AND an old
    pro in another. Over the past year they've had interviews with Chank Diesel, Nick
    Cooke, and Jeremy Dooley, among others. Given the organizational changes, Steve
    Matteson is probably the MOST APPROPRIATE designer to have been interviewed this
    month.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n"

  body: "Hi guys, here is the person who decided, almost single-handedly, that Steve
    would be an interesting person to interview this month. There was no board meeting,
    no pushing, not even a hint from any of the people at Monotype \u2013 just a \u2018sure,
    good idea\u2019 from the rest of the MyFonts team during our weekly conference
    call. Steve had been on our (MyFonts\u2019) list for a while, and we thought this
    was as good a time as any \u2014 a more \u2018institutional\u2019 designer from
    the US after a long series of interviews with very independent designers from
    Europe and Latin America. With, of course, the added benefit of his Monotype fonts
    now being available again (the Ascender fonts were on MyFonts all along). It did
    cross my mind that an interview with Steve right after the takeover could be seen
    as symbolic, but then I dismissed that thought: if we want to interview a great
    designer who has recently brought out one of his most interesting typefaces to
    date (Massif), then it\u2019s silly to let paranoia get in the way. And while
    we, MyFonts, weren\u2019t as calculating as Herb\u2019s post suggests (it is mostly
    content, not business, that  underlies our decisions about whom to interview)
    we did think it was a nice occasion to present one of our new colleagues: an interesting
    guy, passionate about his work and with great hobbies. So to spell it out: decision-making
    about these things hasn\u2019t changed at MyFonts. It\u2019s still us."
