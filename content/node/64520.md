body: "I was looking through the Google book archive, and found a curious thing:\r\nMost
  German books printed in 1800s have the following numeration(?)\r\nscheme printed
  at the bottom of the pages. Initially, I assumed those letter and number combination
  to be binders marks, destined to aid in folding pages. But the irregularity of their
  appearance seems odd. They always appear on the recto page, never seem to go above
  5, and are followed by a varying number of unmarked pages until the next letter
  is introduced.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea what those are?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numero_4184.gif]\r\n\r\nRecto:
  A\r\nVerso: Nothing\r\nRecto: A 2\r\nVerso: Nothing\r\nRecto: A 3\r\nVerso: Nothing\r\nRecto:

  body: "It must be some sort of folio numbering, although I cannot recognize the
    system used.\r\nIf so, the first A-folio contains twelve pages, and the 2nd, B,
    sixteen pages. Kind of odd -- both are possible, but are generally the same for
    the larger part of a book. (The decision to print either a 12-page or a 16-page
    sheet depends on the sheet size and the size of individual pages.)"

  body: "No, I don't believe in bookbinder remarks.\r\nIts too close inside the printed
    area and would apear in the printed book atleast. I think the bookbinders around
    1800 were professional enough, to avoid this solution and find a better one.\r\n\r\nCan
    it be, this are remarks for footnotes, which are listed anywhere at the end of
    the book, explaining or analysing this text part?\r\n\r\nThere are to gramar mistakes
    \"...auf diesen kanapee\". It should be \"...auf dieseM Kanapee\" (on this Canap\xE9e).
    But alright, N is Akkusativ, but it must be M = Dativ. But I do not know enough
    german gramar of the 19th century, sry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

    Some keywords: prime, recto and verso printing, perfecting, etc. Since the whole

  body: "As Ulrich Stiehl rightly pointed out, these are instructions for the binding,
    very common in German books from the late 17th \u2013\_early 19th century. Not
    only are these extremely common, sometimes they are set even in bigger type than
    the example.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the sample text is from the beginning of Christoph
    Martin Wieland\u2019s verse epic \xBBOberon\xAB (1780), and the edition is most
    certainly from about 1800. The grammar (accusative) is sound \u2013\_not only
    for 18th century standards."

  body: "Thanks everyone!\r\nThe mystery is solved. \r\nI was leaning towards the
    idea of a binding scheme myself, but was a bit confused by the apparent irregularity
    and more so the size and prominence of these markings, often appearing in larger
    sizes then the body text.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
