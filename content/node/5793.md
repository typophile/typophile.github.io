    <BR> <BR>Apparently, its actually illegal to use any other font in the UK for
    subtitling on digital television &#40;no, really&#41;, and BBC use it for text
    services on DVB too. So that covers digital terrestrial broadcasts &#40;Freeview&#41;,
    but I am not sure about digital satellite &#40;Sky&#41; or digital on demand &#40;Homechoice&#41;.
