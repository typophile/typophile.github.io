  <BR> <BR>As i am currently working on creating a new logo for my own &#40;web&#41;design
  business i thought i would post the current status here for criticism. Its basically
  a refinement of ideas that were used before. I just now finally went to use plain
  vectors ;&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40125.jpg"
  alt="rush.media logo"> <BR> <BR>The symbol stands for energy and speed, attributes
  that are linked to the word &#34;rush&#34;. <BR>I am interested in hearing your
  opinions on this logo, how does it work? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Martin

    is just a symbol and doesn&#39;t connect me to your name. Another way to put it
    would be to take away the name and try and figure out what kind of company the
    logo is for.

    post on this thread, didn&#39;t post. <BR> <BR>Basically, all I said was that
    I got more of an organic growth impression from the mark, rather than &#34;energy
    and speed&#34;. I think this impression might be resulting from the seedlike shapes
    that are repeated in the graphic. <BR> <BR>The dot doesn&#39;t bother me at all.
    It is a natural symbol to use for any web related business. &#34;media&#34; could
    refer to a myriad of different kinds of business, so the dot helps to identify
    you as a web media business. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

    as a flower-type image and it also actually kind of reminds me of one of a child&#39;s
    pinwheel . . . of course these types of different interpretations will happen
    with such a generic-type icon. . .  <BR> <BR>i actually don&#39;t mind the dot
    -- but some other ideas to try to separate the words would be each word in a different
    font or color or maybe even try putting the dot in a different color other than
    black. <BR> <BR>Maybe come up with a few more ideas and take this one in a few
    different directions as well . . .

  body: Following your advices i thought about different or changed symbols to use
    for the logo. <BR> <BR>On the first one i did something completely different.
    Basic idea is to use a gradient to again convey the idea of movement or speed.
    I decided to make it a mosaic to give it a nice touch. Of course you could also
    read it as reference to screen design, i.e. pixels. Now, i am not sure if that
    is all too far fetched to make sense. <BR> <BR>The second one is taking the vortex
    idea a little further and making it more prominent. Also that way the symbol is
    more simple and easier to grasp than in the original. <BR> <BR>Third is basically
    the original, i just took out one layer of shapes to make it a little less complex
    as well. Those of you that said they got an impression of organic growth from
    it are right. There is a certain resemblance to a flower as well. I actually had
    this in the back of my mind when i made it. <BR> <BR>For the type, i really liked
    the suggestion by Sally to use a different color on the dot. I think it works
    well because it makes the dot less dominant so you don&#39;t trip over it when
    looking at it, while it still works to separate the two words. <BR>In earlier
    incarnations of design i did use italics and bold type on rush and media like
    suggested, but this time i would rather not do that as i found it makes the name
    look unbalanced. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40321.jpg"

  body: 'I don&#39;t think the period should be yellow. It is almost invisible as
    it is here, let alone if it should be photocopied. <BR> <BR>But the main thing
    that bothers me is your symbol. It is static. <BR> <BR>What do you want the symbol
    to convey? If it is swiftness and energy &#40;thus acting together with the word
    &#39;rush&#39;&#41;, I don&#39;t think you can achive it by using this symetric
    vector graphic. <BR> <BR>I think motion can be designated two ways with graphics:
    <BR> <BR>A <BR>The picture designates a thing that is moving. &#40;Examples: a
    drawing of hunting falcon, a picture of Superman with his one arm outstretched&#41;.
    Explanation: we see the thing move because we know it moves. <BR> <BR>B <BR>The
    picture is an arrangement of elements placed dynamicly &#40;Example: a line of
    dots placed with increasing distance&#41; Explanation: The gestalt laws determine
    this arrangement &#34;moves&#34; before our eyes. <BR> <BR>Your abstract symbol
    does not move. On level A, it could be a fan, rotating very slowly -- but it resembles
    a flower just as well. On level B, it hardly moves, because it is too symetric.
    <BR> <BR>If you want your symbol to tell a story, and the story has to be swiftness,
    I think you should reconsider it. Or else, let the symbol tell another story &#40;like
    when you started to draw pixels instead&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S'

  body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>thanks again for the feedback. <BR>First let me try to explain
    what i would like to convey with a symbol for my firm. It should symbolize attributes
    like motion, energy and excitement. Not only because that is connected to the
    word rush, but also because these are desirable attributes for the work i do -
    at least in the case of excitement. If you haven&#39;t done so you can go to rushmedia.de
    to get an idea of my work. <BR> <BR>That said, it seems my attempts so far didn&#39;t
    work well. As Soren pointed out the symbols i used are still too static. <BR>I
    still like the idea of a vortex, and i wonder if i could change it in a way to
    make the element of motion apparent enough. However i also think about other images
    that could be used to symbolize motion. I want to stay with simple abstract shapes
    if possible. <BR> <BR>I will work on new/improved symbols. If you have any further
    suggestions i am happy to hear them.

  body: I think their is something in the square mark that is intreaging. You have
    subtley created motion within the square shape by using variations of color. The
    contrast of elements is kind of nice. Plus you reference pixels which is a nice
    connection to the multimedia world. In fact, motion on screen is created by the
    changes of color from pixel to pixel. <BR> <BR>There would be no need to round
    the edges of the square. <BR> <BR>Asymetry is what creats motion! <BR> <BR>

  body: I agree with Soren also and a way to make your flower rush may be to spiral
    the petals outward &#40;does that make sense?&#41; increasing in size as they
    go and possibly also color intensity. That would give it a somewhat tunnel feel
    like a vortex.

  body: 'In keeping with many of the other postings I agree that the spiral versions
    of your logo are not quite hitting the mark. They seem more representive of spinning
    &#40;which can be more of a negative ie: spinning one&#39;s wheels but getting
    nowhere&#41; than &#34;rushing&#34; or getting from here to there. At first I
    wasn&#39;t wild for the dot. Depending upon your clients, it could be confusing
    for them as they look for the url rush.media. Who are you branding yourself to?
    If they are tech savy it&#39;s not an issue of course but on the whole the general
    public still finds the web a little overwhelming and confusing. On your second
    go-around with the colored dot it became more of a graphic element and therefore
    less likely it would be misinterputed as part of an address.  <BR> <BR>So far
    I like the square/pixel version however, I would suggest making the dot a small
    square.  <BR> <BR>Overall perhaps you should re-think your design elements. In
    your first posting you said these were refinements from previously used designs,
    are you trying to keep the old elements simply for recognition?  <BR> <BR>Just
    went to your web site. The spiral logos do look like flowers and you use a lot
    of floral imagery on your site, perhaps it&#39;s the name that should be re-thought,
    flowers don&#39;t really convey the concepts of speed and energy. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Thanks for the continued support. <BR>Some of you liked the idea of my pixel
    symbol, hinting to screen design and using the gradient to convey an idea of movement.
    I took the idea one step further to add the kind of rush i was looking for. Putting
    the square in perspective i think it combines the impression of motion and of
    the pixels as the elements of screen design. <BR>I made two versions for now,
    with slightly different angles. Also i tried if i could place the symbol behind
    the word in the smaller version. Just food for thought. <BR>I really prefer the
    rounded corners on the symbol for a number of reasons. First, it gives a nice
    resemblance to the image of a screen. Second, it &#34;holds together&#34; the
    single squares, making it look more like one unit. And last, it works well together
    quite well with the font used imho. I also made the dot between the words into
    a rounded rectangle to go along with the symbol. <BR> <BR>Below, there is different
    versions of the vortex symbols. I tried to add more motion to them. I am not convinced
    though and the approach maybe just doesn&#39;t work. No matter what it always
    looks more like a flower than anything else. I wanted to put them here anyways
    though. <BR> <BR>I am very much leaning towards the &#34;pixel and screen&#34;
    symbol, it looks fresh and clean, and i really like the abstract approach. <BR>Your

  body: Not to change the subject back to the period, but I think the period detracts
    from your intention to convey speed and energy. It has a connotation of stopping,
    not rushing. I think it would be more consistent to use a slash, or a bullet,
    or have one word bold and one not as someone suggested.

    BORDER=0> <BR>Is this what you are having in mind when you were talking of an
    arrangement of pixels that would really create movement? <BR>Those arrangements
    are definitely not perfect, in fact looking at it now it reminds me of fireworks.
    <BR> <BR>Plus i got rid of the dot to see how it looks. I agree that having a
    dot in the name is a flawed concept. Graphically however i still like to have
    it though, it just adds a little something. I think its true that you should be
    careful trying to replace the dot with something else, to make sure it does not
    confuse the viewer.  <BR> <BR>I have to say that i like Davids of idea of making
    the colors on the pixels dynamic or vary them for different applications. That
    would be a real nice touch.  <BR>The other idea of forming a letter &#34;r&#34;
    with the pixel colors is maybe too hard to convey. Nevertheless i made a quick
    example. It might be an option to alter the shapes of the pixels to form a letter

    been playing with pixels on paper and in my mind, but i don&#39;t seem to be able
    to create that strong movement. How would you arrange a set of pixels that depicts
    &#34;rush&#34;? Something like streaks?  <BR>My thoughts when i did the last designs
    was of a moving object &#40;the bigger pixels&#41; that will leave a trail &#40;of
    smaller pixels&#41;. So the different pixels sizes were not meant as an information
    of distance, though i agree this is true also. <BR> <BR>The other symbol of a
    &#34;screen&#34; could be animated, yes. I did not do this for now, as it has
    to work as well without it, it would just be a nice little enhancement for the
    web. <BR> <BR>I think i would agree, after all the different designs, that maybe
    one of these will work just as good in their own way.

    The only way to truley show motion is with film. Motion on a screen ISN&#39;t
    really motion at all. It is however pixels changing color to create the ILLUSION
    of motion. I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE LOGO ALWAYS MOVING ON &#34;SCREEN&#34;. However
    each logo by itself on a given piece of &#34;PRINTED&#34; matter would unable
    to show motion because it is imposible. Think of it as taking a photo of a pixel
    arrangent. Or think of it as a freeze frame in a movie.

    to create a rush of movement. <BR> <BR>It is certainly what I envision now. <BR>
    <BR>As a printed logo of course it lacks rush, and you can work out compositions

    <BR> <BR>The idea of moving pixels inside the square on the webpage is great,
    as everybody agrees. I definitely want to do that. <BR>What i am still fighting
    with is what to do with the symbol for print matters. Of course you are right
    when you say that a snapshot of this skewed square symbol is not showing as much
    of a motion. However the basic appearance of the square should remain, shouldn&#39;t
    it? <BR>So how are your thoughts &#40;Soren and Andrew&#41; about creating motion
    for a still version of the logo? <BR> <BR>Also, i have followed your advice of
    playing with shape arrangements, but i admit for me it only works so far. Creating
    the impression of fast movement with only a few shapes i don&#39;t achieve in
    a convincing way. <BR>Thats why i used the gradient of color that, like a strong
    motion blur, resembles fast movement in a picture.  <BR> <BR>If you can give me
    some more ideas i&#39;d be thankful.

  body: Andrew-- Thanks for the suggestion, thats a good concept. I just wonder if
    you imagine to merge this into the idea of the square symbol, or if that is supposed
    to be a different idea. Looking at it i could imagine using the skewed square
    i have and blending it into this row of shapes. So that i am retaining the skewed
    square as a mark and at the same time use the stronger dynamics you propose. <BR>
    <BR>David-- Why would i want to show motion? That is the concept i want to base
    this mark on, so of course its supposed to show motion not only in a digital media
    context, i.e. on the webpage where it is actually possible to animate the symbol,
    but also if it is printed and not actually moving. <BR> <BR>The color orange?
    First of all it was/is a personal preference, but beyond that orange is considered
    a color that represents energy, enthusiasm, creativity, to name a few. So it is
    very appropriate imho. <BR>

    how to improve on its weak points. Also thanks to your input that i value a lot.
    <BR>I have been stuck with the screen symbol that on one hand carries some good
    ideas but also has its shortcomings. Main point in question is the impression
    of movement it conveys. I could not come up with any convincing solution to fix
    that lack of motion. I tried with Andrew&#39;s suggestion, but the breaking point
    was to create a mark that is not becoming too complex. <BR>I am still all for
    the idea of animating a symbol on the web and want to stick with the use of visible
    pixels. However the mark also has to work for print use in a non-animated state,
    which turns out to be a problem. <BR>Following these thoughts i decided to come
    up with more distinct shapes. Since previous pixel designs were already hinting
    to arrows, this is what i went with here. <BR>The right one is something that
    just happened when playing around and i found it looks interesting. The left one
    is the serious suggestion, which is easy to recognize as arrows. At the same time
    i have made changes to the type, as it seemed that with a small and light symbol
    it works better to combine the two words and distinguish them by font weight.

  body: Thanks for your comments,  <BR> <BR>Andrew-- You are right that your suggested
    arrow shapes provide a stronger feeling of movement. However in my impression
    they feel too heavy and massive. Why i separated mine and used the angle is because
    i actually like feeling of ease and lightness i get from it. <BR>Plus i didn&#39;t
    completely drop the idea of pixels, even though they are less prominent then before.
    <BR> <BR>David-- Your idea of moving, as in shifting color, pixels is great.  I
    had understood your concept right away. My only problem, and i am still not absolutely
    sure if that really is a problem, is that for print use it is possibly not distinct
    enough. So i am thinking, while still using pixels, build a shape from the pixels
    that again speaks motion. <BR> <BR>Scott-- Different colors is definitely an option.
    I have been thinking about using color for the logotype as well. I will try a
    cool grey. <BR> <BR>I am leaning towards the concept with arrow shapes, but maybe
    i can get some more opinions.

  body: It&#39;s not a problem if you are a &#34;motion/web&#34; designer. One solution
    to this ? would be to use a different logo on each variation of printed matter.
    On the business card you could use one logo and on the letterhead you could use
    another and on the envelope, yet another. You have infinite flexibility in terms
    of how many variations of hue that can exist in the square verision of your logo.  <BR>The
    reason why you might use different logos on each piece is so you will create the
    overall illusion of motion from one thing to the next. <BR>The logo is changing
    at all times, even on your own stationery.

    in a specific direction. What if you were showing backward motion, sideways motion,
    or slow motion. <BR> <BR>It would be wierd of everything on screen was going the
    opposite direction of your logo.  <BR> <BR>I am pointing this out because I sense
    that for a web/motion studio you might want to be neutral to all aspects of motion
    graphics and web design. The logo itself shouldn&#39;t be overly designed if you
    want to capture the hearts of all possible clientel not just the ones who want
    fast hyper flashy motion design. But then again I might be crazy

    up the results so far, i both like the use of visible pixels and i also want some
    shapes that speak movement. The last design with arrows didn&#39;t seem too bad,
    but i haven&#39;t been satisfied with it. <BR> <BR>Thus i have been playing with
    arrangements of arrows and the following is what i came up with. While it obviously
    does not emphasize speed as much as before, it introduces a meaning of its own.
    With three arrows pointing towards the center and one outwards, the symbol speaks
    of combining input from various sources into one strong and powerful result. <BR>To
    emphasize the asymmetry of the logo i decided to use a second color. Personally
    what appeals to me is the relative closeness of the symbol while keeping movement
    through asymmetry. <BR> <BR>So, this one is more subtle again, and i don&#39;t
    know if i am nuts going that way. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/43137.jpg"

    qualities and directions about them. It feels like you are trying to say to much
    in the latest logo. It is confusing as to which direction you want the logo to
    take me. There are three arrows pointing inward and one out. I personaly can&#39;t
    wrap my head around this rationale. The logo and the type also feel like they
    are in two different dimensions. What made you choose that typeface? To me the
    logo looks a little to Galaga&#40; the video game&#41; It feels like it&#39;s
    going to shoot another spaceship any moment. I guess you know my opinion at this
    point and so I&#39;ll stop blabbing. My favorite is still the 6 squares forming
    one square. That logo tells me all I need to know and leaves infinite possiblilities
    to my imagination. Look at how Hewlett Packard has used the PLUS symbol. Or the
    H&#43;R block green square. The green square is so symbolic it is freaking mind
    boggling. Anyway, good luck.
