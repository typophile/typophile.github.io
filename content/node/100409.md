  body: "Based on what little I really know about Opti/Castcraft/TypeFoundersOfChicago,
    the cited originals were both film-strips and cast metal fonts, many of which
    were digitized by others in addition to Opti's rather crude renderings.  They
    gave new names to most of the fonts that they err... re-created. Some metal fonts
    may have been recast. Most, but not all, of Opti's digital opus can be found by
    other makers, usually in better quality.\r\n\r\nThere's tons of information available,
    lots of it right here in Typophile.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    in the US? But many of those fonts do have legitimate (meaning original-owner\u2013sanctioned)
    digital versions, so I don't think those ones are ethical = I don't think Typophile
    should welcome that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nThen there's the issue of how people
    in countries that <em>do</em> honor design copyright (like most of Western Europe)
    should handle those fonts...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that using them on this board might be taking away potential affiliate fees from
    Typophile as a source of financial support for the site. Just as I presume the
    \"What The Font\" forum at MyFonts is (to some degree) aimed at generating sales
    for their site, I figured it likely that Typophile has referral arrangements with
    the major font outlets."
