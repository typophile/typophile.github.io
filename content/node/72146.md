  you find the printer, or do you just include it in the cost.  Like carpenters get
  a cut of all materials bought.

  body: "If you pay for printing costs you should be marking the cost up 5\u201310%
    to cover your associated labor, costs, the risk you take of losing the money if
    the client doesn\u2019t like the final product, and the time your money is tied
    on the line while you wait for the client to pay you back. If the client doesn\u2019t
    want to pay your markup, you give them the files on CD and tell them to deal with
    printing themselves."

  body: Advertising agencies routinely mark up all purchased goods and services 17.65%;
    however, if you pay the printer in order to charge the mark-up, you're on the
    hook if your client is a slow pay or no-pay.

    or agencies can nickel and dime their clients. While medium and low end have to
    think about soaking up the costs to be price competitive. '

  body: You can also negotiate a flat consulting fee for print management. You and
    your client may both prefer this, since you won't be penalized financially if
    you reduce their printing costs.

  body: "I would keep time & expenses entirely separate. If you need to spend time
    picking a printer, getting printing bids, doing a press check, etc then there's
    no reason to hide that in your markup. It's a legitimate part of your design fee.
    \r\n\r\nExpenses such as printing should be itemized separately on your invoice,
    and it's customary to add a markup (in the ballpark of 15% is fairly common).
    And always mention the markup in your estimate (\"a standard markup of x% will
    be added to all expenses\") so there are no misunderstandings later."

  body: "Often the markup is justified because the designer gets a trade discount
    from the printer and then can charge retail. The client can't really complain
    about the markup because they'd end up paying the same either way.\r\n"

    The client can't really complain\r\n\r\nYes, but as long as the markup is reasonable,
    there's no reason for a designer to ever feel the need to \"justify\" adding a
    markup. Adding a markup is standard business practice. Every plumber, carpenter,
    painter, optician, ad agency -- virtually anyone in any business -- adds a markup
    to their expenses. "
