  body: To my knowledge, Quicksilver has been digitised and sold bundled with old
    Corel products, I think it's no longer available. If you're after a similar look,

  body: If you look in the corner of the Zappa design, you can see Rick Griffin's
    signature. The lettering and the flying eyeball cartoon in the middle are typical
    of his style.

  body: "***THE STORY OF LETRASET'S QUICKSILVER TYPEFACE***\r\nI'm Dean Morris, the
    designer of the typeface \"Quicksilver\" that came out in 1976 as part of Letraset's
    Letragraphica range of rub-down fonts, the stylishly aggeressive ones in the yellow
    pages of the catalog. I named the typeface \"Quicksliver\" because it looked like
    bent thermometers \u2014 quicksilver being a nickname for mercury (I never meant
    it to suggest neon), and because \"Quicksilver\" had some of the cooler letters
    such as Q, K, E, and R. The name was my second choice, however. Letraset Englishly
    felt that my first choice, \"Polished Sausage\", would be \"rather unpopular iln
    foreign markets\". I designed it as a 16 year-old kid in John Glenn High School
    in Bay City, Michigan, and sent Letraset a xerox of a tight sketch of 3\" letters
    kerned with the heavy outlines slightly overlapping as I originally intended.
    I drew only the skinny S without an alternate and submitted no punctuation (what
    did I know?).  Letraset must have wanted it real fast (disco was WHITE HOT then,
    remember), because they did the finished art themselves at 5\" high (they can't
    have known my age, maybe they had no confidence in my technical talent), starting
    with the E as did I in the design stage. And what a gorgeous rendering job they
    did in the pre-Mac days of ruling pens, straightedges, and handdrawn curves (those
    aren't compass curves)! Letraset stayed very close to my tight sketch, designed
    the punctuation, and suggested an alternate but wierd wide S, which I approved,
    figuring there was probably no other decent way to design it. I imagined the punctuation
    would match the stroke width of the letters but they drew them narrower and slightly
    oddly, but I figured what the hell. If you wondered, \"What was I thinking?\"
    when you looked at the  A, B, E, F, K, N, Q, R, and Y, I'll tell you. I was simply
    trying to describe part of the letter being drawn in the wrong direction. I thought
    I was so clever. For instance the E cross-stroke goes from right to left rather
    than from left to right like, oh, any other Roman cap E in history. R and Q diagonals
    came from waaaaaaaay on the other side, N goes waaaaaaay around the wrong way
    before starting the diagonal. \"Chrome\" letters can branch but these \"glass
    tube\" letters don't! Alas, digitization came along eventually and fontographer
    technology followed. Crash went sales of rub-down type, and control of artwork
    was pirated without my knowledge and beyond my control, which I don't condone
    but I totally understand. The first album cover I saw with Quicksilver was Men
    At Work's first smash LP, then punk pioneer Stiff Records' logo appeared on 45
    rpm labels with a clearly Quicksliver-inspired F. For about ten years I, family,
    and friends collected food packages, posters, took photos of signs, etc. with
    Quicksliver from around the world. I think it's about the easiest typeface to
    mishandle ever. Eventually I stopped trying to keep track of it. Maybe I'm overestimating
    its popularity now after 30 years (I totally forgot about it for about a decade),
    but to me seeing it around at all is itself a rave. I can't remember why I Googled
    \"Quicksilver Letraset\" a few days ago and what I found was a whole community
    of sites for font identification and original name lists (where they bothered
    to accurately credit me as designer which gets me RIGHT HERE). It makes me feel
    less forgotten even though I don't see royalties. BTW, I never did, nor did Letraset
    ask me to, design a lower case version. Feel free to pass along this modest piece
    of graphic microhistory to any Letraheads.\r\nDean Morris, May 2007, New York
    City."

    How did they pay designers? Was it a flat fee? Quicksilver is a real classic.
    Too bad you didn''t get royalties on it. DId you ever design any other fonts?'
