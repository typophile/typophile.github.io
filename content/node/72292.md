  I recently started reading up on Die neue Typographie and many of the other guiding
  principles behind Tschichold's work. Does anyone have any good online referances
  for more info on Tschichold, perhaps even some info not too well known or documented.
  \r\n\r\nSecondly there is a typeface designed by Tschichold called Saskia. Does
  anyone know if there is a digital version available?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nGustav"

    Birkh\xE4user, 2007) documents in detail the series of posters that JT designed
    for the Phoebus Palast in 1927. The posters are fascinating in their simplicity
    and reduction: often they needed to be designed and printed in only one or two
    days using the uppercase wooden letterforms that were available.\r\n<em>Jan Tschichold
    \u2013 Master Typographer: His Life, Work & Legacy</em> (Cees W. De Jong, Thames
    & Hudson, 2008) shows a range of early work and reproduces the type specimen of
    Saskia issued by Lettergieterij Amsterdam in 1932."
