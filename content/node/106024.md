  know the name of this font! Have searched all the places I normally look (Da Font,
  Font Squirrel, Identifont, MyFont image identifier thingo) and have had no luck.
  Have found similar fonts, but there would be one character that was different.\r\n\r\nHoping
  someone here might recognise the font. Sorry the sample is so small"
