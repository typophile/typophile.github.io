body: What happend to the typefaces created by VEB Typoart &#40;the East German official
  type foundry&#41;? Did they ever make digital typefaces &#40;I think that they closed
  in 1990&#41;? Were any of their typefaces revived and re-distributed? Did anyone
  buy the company, or the rights to their designs?

  body: To make it short, its a hot thing. <BR>- Typoart have digitized lots of its
    type faces - Ikarus System <BR>- the rights holds a Mr. Holzer, but he is away  since
    he is wanted... <BR>- the data exists on forgotten places - Mr. Holzer have no
    access to my knowledge <BR> <BR>As I have heard, he have tried to sell the rights.
    But its a hot thing to make deals with a wanted deptor. Till now, all living designers
    of typoart got nothing, no royalties, no public recognition.  <BR> <BR>ps. Sprich
    doch mal mit Bruno.

  body: He&#39;s German &#40;right?&#41;, and it seems he&#39;s on the run. Germans
    have previously run to Argentina &#40;and Brazil to a lesser extent too, I guess
    - but I didn&#39;t write Rio or Sao Paolo&#41;. Just a dumb joke, as you might
    suspect. <BR> <BR>hhp
