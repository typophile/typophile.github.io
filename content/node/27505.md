  college (University Jorge Tadeo Lozano. Bogot\xE1, Colombia).\r\n\r\n<strong>[ Please
  view the image before reading more, so you can get a *clean* first impression ]</strong>\r\n\r\nIt
  is going to be called \"La Br\xFAjula\", which in spanish means compass; and is
  meant to represent the one artifact pointing a desired direction, the intention
  of going that specific somewhere, as well as an existing architectural \"spot\"
  in the college called that way (were students wait between classes, read, talk,
  get together, etc).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt is meant to be a young but still institutional
  publication (will be writen and design by students only), showing the variety of
  characters in students and the collage 's will to be in constant change, for the
  good. It was created so students start to feel more like a community.\r\n\r\nAfter
  some discussion, we'll be using Afga Rotis \"family\" for the publication (Serif,
  Semi-Serif, Semi-Sans & Sans-Serif, with their variations), so I started from the
  semi-serif. There is a version for small sizes, in which \"La\" is bolder; just
  an idea.\r\n\r\nCritics, comments, suggestions: All welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/labrujula_5503.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/labrujula02_3625.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nPD:
  This first version is a collab between Daniel Sarmiento and me, not yet official."

    a compass is signified by an arrow pointing north. I see you've got an arrow in
    there, but it's pointing west.\r\n\r\nDoes the spot on campus called La Br\xFAjula
    have some sort of recognizable landmark that could be worked into the logo?\r\n\r\n

  body: "Hi lex,\r\n\r\nWell, the spot on the campus is actually a compass, made out
    of bricks rising about 30-40 cms as a flat circled surface of a 2-2.5m diameter,
    having a compass drawn (incrusted metal of some sort) on its top. I'll try to
    get a picture soon.\r\n\r\nI see what you mean about the arrow. We were trying
    to make it more typographic rather than analogical (didn't wanted to show an actual
    compass), we only intended to show direction (notice oneway serifs), but the fact
    that it is \"pointing\" west I haven't realized.\r\n\r\nRight now I can't think
    of something to solve that, is it too bad, what do you think? Suggestions? We
    previously tried something with the descendant of the J; Ill post it with the
    pic of the campus' spot.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/labrujula_spot_4461.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    are some photographs of the spot in the campus, they aren't so good, sorry for
    that; Im not that of a photographer.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nwww.gabssnake.4t.com"

  body: "gabssnake, the header is really looking good. But i think you need some minor
    modifications. May be you can wait for the feedback from other typophilies..here
    are my thoughts.\r\n\r\n>>. 1\r\nThe counter space between B,r and u is too wide..and
    because of this the over all header is looking weaker at this part.\r\n>>. 2\r\nThe
    centre horizontal bar..which is coming out from the '-B' is not going with the
    serifs of the typeface and not even looking visually good(According to me)\r\n>>.
    3\r\nThe triangular thing(between B and r)is really looking bad...may be bacause
    its separate from both the letters. You can Identify the B without that also.\r\n>>.
    4 \r\nWhy the both U's are different from each other?\r\n\r\nThese are just my
    thoughts...wait for real comments from the other senior members.\r\n\r\nsatya,\r\nStudent,

    body: "satya,\r\nThank you very much for your comments, I'll try to answer them
      as good as I can.\r\n\r\nI now see the uneven space there between the \"bru\",
      specially the \"ru\" pairs. I honestly don't know what to do about it, I can't
      close it more beacause of the serif in the U. Maybe I could separate everything
      a little bit to make it look more consistent, but I'm worried about losing solidness.\r\n\r\nI'll
      be trying a different \"arrow\" for the B, stay close so you can further comment.\r\n\r\nI'll
      try a version without the black form, I only left it because I thought it would
      loss some recognition.\r\n\r\nI took the serif out of the first U because it
      was looking too \"heavy\" whith the acute accent. I'll post the previous version
      for you guys to see. By the way, is this looking odd? Most people don't even
      notice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nwww.gabssnake.4t.com"

    a ligature on \"RU\" pair, 2) discard the black form left from the circle, 3)
    same Us: added a serif to the first one.\r\n\r\na1 - just added the revisions.\r\na2
    - modified R serif to try to match B\r\na3 - R with no serif\r\nab1 - both arrows
    implemented\r\nb1 - no arrow on the B\r\nb2 - a variaton of b1, contaning a rombus

    too. excellent work. Liked the way you joined the r and u to resolve the whitespace
    problem between them. Go with this.\r\n\r\nIt will also looks nice if you dont
    have that arrow at the bottom of the 'j'..like in a3.\r\n\r\nNice work gabssnake.\r\n\r\nsatya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just a thought - I don't speak Spanish, so I don't know if this will work.\r\n\r\nWhat
    if you took the shape of the compass arrow from your photograph (the circle with
    the diamond shape) and used it instead of the accent on the '\xFA'? It would probably
    work best if pointed straight up, but if that won't read properly in Spanish,
    try angling it to the right. You probably won't need any other arrow shapes in
    this case, so base it off of version b1, with the 'j' from version a.\r\n\r\nThis
    is just a thought, it may or may not work.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I have reservations about the ru ligature, certainly there is a white area
    in the original, but that is part of the nature of the characters and I think
    that it is important to keep them seperate, in order to address the uneven white
    space I would suggest kerning the other characters further apart and redrawing
    the loop of the j to compensate (though without the arrow). I would also consider
    dropping any pictorial reference to a compass, there is enough in the name and
    I assume nearly all the students would make the connection. For the La the unicase
    style isn't working for me could you make them the same point size and nestle
    the a in the angle of the L. I find the accent a little stunted as if it is cut
    off before it reaches a point, the purpose would I guess have been to make it
    work within Rotis at text sizes, I think you could make it lean more to the horizontal
    more sympathetic to the angle of the serifs and finish it with a narrower end
    and return to the cropped off serif, you could even consider removing the dot
    of the j.\r\nTim"

  body: "Hello!\r\nI didn't post since a long time friends, and a lot of things happened
    to the header... First, terrible thing to say, is that the magazine crew didn't
    like it a all (we went with one of the above with slight mods), and I mean, AT
    ALL.\r\n\r\nWe had to totally change it, this time they wanted something more
    \"product-like\", \"according to current aesthetic tendencies\", not so \"classic\"
    or \"boring\" they sayd. We'll, what can I say...\r\n\r\nWe had to redo it, all
    the way from the drawingboard.\r\nThis time I took advantage of my partner and
    did it by myself.\r\nThe concepts were \"variety/diversty\" and \"change (constant
    movement)\", refering to the aspects which we presume identify the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cabezote_v0_6607.2b.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe
    didn't had so mucho time, so this was only one first intent and one small correction.
    Then it went straight to the plates (30,000 on magazines already, also some posters/advertising).\r\n\r\nThere
    have been released 3 numbers of the magazine, and we're planning to improve some
    things for the next year. I would like to start from the header. Then I remembered
    how supportive you guys were with the first one. ;)\r\n\r\nDon't go soft with
    critics/observations. I know we've got a lot to improve. Regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:
    I'll be posting/linking some of the covers/pages of the magazine so you can check
    them out ;)\r\nBtw, UJTL is short for \"Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano\".\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nwww.gabssnake.4t.com"

    open to changing the logo now that 3 issues have already appeared?\r\n\r\nI think
    the one they went with is almost illegible, and looks very dated like what was
    in style in the US 8-10 years ago. Funny how they didn't want anything classic
    or boring, and yet the logo is made up of parts of \"classic\" scripts and \"boring\"
    sans serifs.\r\n\r\nI would advise coming up with 3 different concepts to present,
    not just variations on 1 concept like what you posted earlier in the thread."
