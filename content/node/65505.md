body: "A new family has come\r\n\r\nA new pair of serif and sans\r\nFor cold assertions
  to warm anecdotes \r\n\r\nDesigners heed these words\r\nA well-yoked posture will
  prevail\r\nTypographers alike, mind this\r\n\r\nNo more Morisonified faces\r\nWill
  scourge the surfaces of their pages\r\nFor a Garalde, and a new take on Gill\r\nIn
  lieu of the committeed crumbs\r\nA fully-formed featured font"
