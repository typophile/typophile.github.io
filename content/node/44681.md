    a book for the University of Illinois Press, set using Linotron 202 Joanna. I
    forget the title, but can look it up if you really need it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of
    that, Gill's best text font available in major foundry form (i.e., Linotype, Monotype)
    was probably Pilgrim. I remember a lecture by Ron Costley where he remarked that
    none of Gill's fonts was a very good for setting book-length text. Afterwards,
    I asked him about Pilgrim, & as I remember, he did allow it could be quite good
    for text, just damaged by the poor character fit in the Linotron 202 offering.
    With PostScript, that could be easily fixed.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    which seem to belong to another family, serve as an unwelcome speed-bump for the
    reader, though others love them for precisely that effect...also Joanna's figures
    seem crude, whereas Whitman's figures look right to the point of transparency.
    \r\n\r\nAll in all, the appearance of Whitman allowed me to get the Joanna roman
    look without the Joanna problems. Whitman seems so right it achieves transparency."

  body: "From the sublimity of \"Victorian Review,\" I take you to what many consider
    the height of ridiculousity: ice fishing. Book designer Brian Donahue has submitted
    sample pages for a photo book on that subject, and he's used Joanna as his text
    face:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Joannaicefishing_6688.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    was not thrilled when I read his note before opening the file, for Joanna has
    never been a favorite of mine. I like the \"idea\" of Joanna, but have rarely
    seen it used well. But this book may help me appreciate the face. It is well suited
    to the matter. Its overall sharpness evokes that first great lungfull of cold
    winter air. Its \"f\" looks like something one could catch an eelpout on. I'm
    really happy with the choice.\r\n\r\nMy dislike of Joanna goes back to metal days.
    Few USA Monotype houses had mats for Joanna,  so if one wanted Joanna, choice
    was limited. Los Angeles Typefounders set a lot of horrendous Joanna for me once.
    It appeared that sorts had been cast on wrong set widths, and the line composition
    had to be re-worked by hand.\r\n\r\n& the first versions I saw for photo and digital
    also had major problems. So I just put it out of mind. \"Victorian Review\" and
    this ice fishing book suggest I should re-look at the face.\r\n\r\nAt times in
    the past when I wanted the \"feel\" of Joanna I used Chaparral. Whitman is, of
    course, a much better face for text setting.\r\n\r\npowers"
