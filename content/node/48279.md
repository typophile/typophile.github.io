body: "I'm looking for suggestions on what would be the most readable typeface for
  body copy on a design oriented blog my friend and I are working on. Obviously, going
  to need to be something users from different operating systems are able to see,
  and as of now would like to keep it around 10 or 11 points.\r\n\r\nBasically, it's
  a blog on Wordpress by and for student designers, and we're about to pay so we can
  edit the CSS. The current template we're using has Arial strung across it, and I
  can no longer take it.\r\n\r\nSo, body copy suggestion that will work at 10 or11
  points? I've been going through the fonts on my computer and have some in mind,
  but am looking for some other thoughts."

  body: If you're going for cross-platform compatibility (as you should), there are
    only a few typefaces on nearly all computers. The best ones for text out of that
    small bunch are Georgia, Verdana, Times (New Roman), Arial, Trebuchet, Courier
    (in my order of body copy preference). I would recommend Georgia or Verdana myself.

  body: "Cross-platform compatibility is pretty much on the top of the list of priorities.
    I'm going to take a look at Georgia on the site now, as I passed it earlier I
    thought about, but never took a look at it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the typeface for the
    posts in this forum? I can't believe I can't just look at it and know. I guess
    I'd rather ask than make a ridiculous guess."

  body: "I was going to recommend Georgia before I opened the thread. \r\n\r\nConsider
    12 points, its comparable to 10 pt when printed. And I think extra leading (css
    property: line-height) is a must when designing for the web (I usually use 1.4em
    as a minimum). "

  body: As of now, as I've been testing the CSS and previewing it, Georgia is definitely
    going to be the type of choice. Line height is something I need to take a look
    into, and I'll give a look to 1.4em. Thank you very much.
