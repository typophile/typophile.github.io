  some of the fonts in the CD, some of them doesn't have any extension at all. Though
  the book listed them as Opentype or truetype... when I try to install them by draging
  into the system's font folder, it gives an error that they are either not regular
  font file or damaged...\r\n\r\nHow do I install those fonts in the CD that have
  no extensions?\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,"

    got the same book/CD, and for me (working on a PC) there's no problem installing
    these fonts; I certainly don't see any \"[without] any extension at all\".\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver
