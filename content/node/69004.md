body: "Two new specialised versions of Andron Corpus are now listed at MyFonts: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-2/|Andron
  2 English and Andron 2 Deutsch]].\r\n\r\nBased on the normal Latin alphabet, these
  two fonts feature certain charactersitics inspired by Frakur type, yet without actually
  applying the aspect of broken strokes. As a result, the fonts offer an interesting
  alternative e.g. for literature typesetting, when a kind of traditional appeal is
  wanted but not any \u2018blackletter look\u2019. \r\n\r\nBoth fonts contain comprehensive
  ligature sets and other fancies.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/And_2_ENG_Muster1_6051.jpg]"
