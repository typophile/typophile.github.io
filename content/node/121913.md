  body: "Looks like something printed in metal type. Any info as to date, publisher,
    title etc.? Any more samples, esp. if distinctive letters like _Q_, _K_, _R_,
    _M_, _5_, _3_ etc.?\r\nDon"

  body: No more information unfortunately, I only have one sheet which has none of
    the distinctive capital letters you've mentioned.  It does have an N and a C if
    that helps at all!
