  body: "I realise this may be a bit controversial but I think using a font for this
    type of work would mean you have little of the interest and power you get from
    a hastily but expertly hand drawn text. Try doing it yourself if you're producing
    anything I reckon\r\n--N"

  body: Not controversial at all. If you're creating a logo or small snippets of text
    that would be my recommendation too.

  body: It is sometimes futile to match a logo with a font. Designers may pick a font
    to alter at times but in order to get their fee justified their output must be
    unique.
