  interest in their Crystal Mark when I couldn't identify the type used. The 'a' and
  trapped 'M' looks like Haas Unica whilst the '3' and 'g' look more like Helvetica.
  Is it some weird hybrid or is it actually Haas Unica?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crystal

  body: The straight line on under side of the top of the number one glyph is not
    right for Haas Unica - should follow curve up main stem.

  body: Really? All the samples I've seen have the flat underside on the top of the
    1.

  body: Not really - sorry Ben - Haas Unica and Helvetica both have the curve but
    only on the Light or Thin weight and that was the sample I was looking at. Regular
    in both is straight.

  body: MS Sans Serif has a branched k, narrower crossbar on t and wider a and s.
    Also the numerals are quite different.

  body: "No worries, it was worth checking :)\r\n\r\nI've overlaid Haas Unica in red
    so we can see the differences. The numerals seem to be different and I'm wondering
    if there was more than one cut of Unica?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4615.png]"
