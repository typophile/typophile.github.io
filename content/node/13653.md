body: "Not to be confused with [[typophile.com]].\r\n\r\nFor more than seventy years
  the Typophiles have shared their abiding pleasure in fine printing through convivial
  meetings and handsomely produced publications. The Typophiles is a not-for-profit
  educational association that encourages the appreciation and production of fine
  typography and bookmaking. Individually, a Typophile may be a typographer, an art
  director, a printer, a librarian, an artist, a publisher, a paper salesperson, a
  designer, a binder, a calligrapher, a bookseller, a collector, or a teacher. What
  brings us together is enthusiasm for fine books and typography.\r\n\r\nFrom the
  early days, when [[Bruce Rogers]] and [[Fred Goudy]] were among those who informally
  lunched together, down to the present time, beautifully printed Typophile Chap Books,
  monographs, and keepsakes have been produced as a labor of love. These publications
  are examples of the highest standards, with members contributing their talent and
  time to produce books that have become treasured collector's items. A new monograph
  series is now being published annually to great acclaim and distributed to all members
  as one of the perquisites of membership.\r\n\r\nAlthough the regular luncheon meetings
  and the fabled Christmas luncheon party are traditionally held in New York, you
  need not live in the New York area to be a Typophile. All members automatically
  receive publications such as the annual monograph and have the privilege of buying
  Chap Books at the special member's price.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophiles.com/index.html"
