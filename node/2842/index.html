  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK, so it's my turn. <BR> <BR>For over 15 years I've used the name &quot;NEWORLD&quot; (yes, I know others use it too) informally for the multimedia productions/programming that I do. I chose that name because of many reasons, but the one reason that might be usable in logo design is this: &quot;norashkharh&quot; (which translates to &quot;new-world&quot;) is the Armenian name of a fruit that I really love. I've never known its English name, but it looks like a tiny pear with a very thick, fuzzy, dark greenish-brown stem; the body is dark orange, with a thick peel; the seeds are huge, dark brown, and usually in pairs or triples*; the trees have large, thick, dark green leaves. (It's ironic btw that it's originally from the New World, but people here don't seem to harvest them.) <BR> <BR>* Superb ammo for improvised wargames, btw! Just the right heft for pain with no injury. And great aural resonance when dropped onto car roofs (preferably in a fistfull) from a 6th-story apartment&hellip;  :-&gt; <BR> <BR>Anyway, I never had a [decent] logo, but now some of your guys's design sense has [hopefully] rubbed off onto me, and I feel ready to &quot;congeal&quot; a visual identity. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24876.gif" alt="neworld.gif"> <BR> <BR>I would like to have some melding trick in the &quot;w&quot;, not least as an allusion to the WWW. <BR> <BR>For the top-left one, I can make it all-caps, or maybe unicase (which might create a good avenue for &quot;w&quot; trickery). If I leave it lc, I could nestle the &quot;software&quot; above it (to the left of the ascending &quot;ld&quot;). I don't think I can make it an intercap -&quot;NeWorld&quot;- decently, and &quot;Neworld&quot; detracts from the &quot;World&quot; part. <BR> <BR>For the other three, the inside squarish part I'm thinking needs really full, blocky, kinda hard to decipher letters (like in FF Extra) - maybe in reverse field. For the bottom-left one (or maybe the top-right one too), I'm wondering if I could make the &quot;W&quot; into rays*, like a newly rising sun or something - but the &quot;W&quot; would have to remain strongly legible. <BR> <BR>* In which case maybe I could set &quot;NEWORLD&quot; in a semi-circle around a sun-disk (or half a disk). Huh, a disks is a good allusions to a CD too&hellip; <BR> <BR>BTW, the &quot;software&quot; part is really optional. I'd even consider using another word that makes sense (or for the logo just &quot;NEWORLD&quot; maybe). <BR> <BR>Advice appreciated&hellip; and needed! I hope the multiplicity of directions I mention above don't derail some totally different -and much better- ideas you guys might dream up. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian, no apology necessary at all! I'm really not good at logo design, period. But neither am I a megacorporation: as some people have pointed out recently, there's a limit to how relevant an identity can be for a smallfry.  <BR> <BR>I'd like to have something decent that conveys one or two key concepts, and maybe has a little bit of charm/humor too. With the guidance of people here I think I can probably achieve that &quot;internally&quot;. That makes it more personal, not to mention less expensive. If/when I make it big (yeah, right) then I'll spend money in proportion to the relevance of having a good mark. But I'm not <i>that</i> cheap - like I'm considering buying Panoptica if I go with the top-left option. <BR> <BR>Hector, thanks for the pointers. I guess basically I want people to think I know how to handle the &quot;new world&quot; of media. It's not that new any more I guess, but being an &quot;old hand&quot; at &quot;new media&quot; (since '87) has its advantages. This &quot;old-timer of the new world&quot; aspect I think is conveyed well with Amerind symbology - plus it has a personal dimension, so it would tell people something about me, although very indirectly. <BR> <BR>&gt; what is so goddamed (did I write this well?) good about you. <BR> <BR>I would like to convey my affinity for innovation and technique. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems ( from the posts so far )  like you are jumping into the creative act before knowing what you intend. <BR> <BR>You would never design a typeface without having it's intended use/purpose in mind would you? <BR> <BR>I don't really think it's wrong to say to yourself - 'maybe a sun design, maybe a deep red color '- or whatever you may think up.  However I do think you would feel more confident &amp; satisfied in your choice if you knew what your you meant by those choices. Your pleasure &amp; confidence in your mark could be good for business in &amp; of itself! <BR> <BR>If I were doing this project I would want to know what you wanted a prospective client to assume about you. Logos are great for suggesting things about their owners/companies.  <BR> <BR>If your logo was a poem spoken into the unconcious mind of a viewer allowing you to quietly shape his ideas about your company - what would it say? <BR> <BR>With the Nike swoosh you get : motion. Simple. That's what I think the nice swoosh's 'poem' is. Motion. <BR> <BR>Another issue is distictiveness. What do your competitors logos/identities look like? You should probably avoid anything that looks too much like their logos or which uses similar ideas to avoid any confusion &amp; or any dimishing of your logo. <BR> <BR>What about having a no logo identity which work off of graphic standards rather than a mark per se? Or a logo that is a set of variations rather than something static? I have to admit that some of the best work I have seen in the last 10 years seems to be about identity rather than a 'logo'. There are logos in most of the examples I am thinking about but the logo is part of an larger &amp; cohesive whole. <BR> <BR>Where the logo will be used - computer screens/web presumably - but where else? Does it need to work at a small size on a TV screen for instance?  <BR> <BR>If you know where it is going to be used that will shape your thinking too. It's quite alot like like when you know a font is going to be used on newsprint- you will avoid obvious problems when designing it or selecting it.  <BR> <BR>A one color design, or a design that works well in one color can save on repro costs too! <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, I'm usually guilty of overloading my design work, so I'm trying to keep things simple this time. As I said before, &quot;I would like to convey my affinity for innovation and technique&quot;, and/or of being an old-timer in new media. But even that might be asking too much, so just some humour/meaning would be great - which is what I'm trying to do with the arc-of-a-circle stuff (and now with the rays). But I'm frankly not sure what that button is&hellip; :-/  It's supposed to be a &quot;digital eye&quot; or something&hellip; Do you guys think the logo would look OK with nothing there? <BR> <BR>Of the stuff I've tried so far, the only two that speak to me are the simple ones with the &quot;triple-u&quot; (maybe sans swoosh), and this latest one. <BR> <BR>BTW, isn't it cool that this lastest one is getting an Amerind feel without me even trying? <BR> <BR>&gt; What do your competitors logos/identities look like? <BR> <BR>That's a very good question. But it feels like there's too many of them to figure out what <i>not</i> to look like&hellip; What I guess I can/should do is look at the bigger local outfits, ones that my potential clients might go to instead of going with me. Do you guys know of a directory where I can them look up? <BR> <BR>&gt; a logo that is a set of variations rather than something static? <BR> <BR>This type of thing fascinates me, and it's fashionable now too. I'll think about it. Any ideas yourself on this? <BR> <BR>BTW, the logo will be used mostly on business cards, stationary and in credits of produced pieces - so nothing <i>too</i> low-fidelity. One big advantage my logo could have though is being animatable. And I think something made up of rays has a lot of potential there. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">When you say &quot; affinity for innovation and technique&quot; I guess I was thinking of the evocation associations that are less cerebral &amp; more emotional or poetic. Innovation could be bleed out into description like mutable, as opposed to static, variety etc. It could also associate with ideas of dynamicness, shifting - not resting. <BR> <BR>When you say technique I can't imagine what you couyld mean. I think of skilled maybe but I don't feel confident that thats what you have in mind. <BR> <BR>About the logo you have going I think you don't need the eye per se. It seems like an afterthought to me - as it is being presented now. I get the idea that you press the button &amp; you get a glowing new world. If thats the idea then maybe it would be good to integrate the two a little more.  <BR> <BR>I bet the letters could work on their own though! <BR> <BR>I would loose the button myself. When I look at GUI with buttons I usually don't like it because the metaphor of the physical is almost always wrong somehow. In the case of a logo it's less so but my prejudice remains.  <BR> <BR>&lt;venting&gt;Buttons are so then&hellip; Also the rise of simple text based blogs &amp; boards like this one &amp; typographi.ca which use simple looking but sophiticated layout are happily showing us that buttons are not needed.&lt;/venting&gt;      <BR> <BR>What about adding some kind of texture or phyical reference to the logo. Like as if it was woven into a basket or cut into pottery - Amerind craftishness embeded at a subliminal level could offer alot of richness.  <BR> <BR>That actually might refer to your idea of 'technique' via the reference of craft.  <BR> <BR>Alot of what I have enjoyed about your posts is that you seem concerned with legitimate craft as a means to expression as opposed to expression without regard for craft. I am probably putting words in your mouth to some extent &amp; if so sorry about that if I am.  <BR> <BR>- Actually you could have versions of the logo as they would be woven carved or printed using a variety of old style, real world, materials as a basis for a logo with multiple permutations.  <BR> <BR>hmm  <BR> <BR>Also would you sell type designs under this brand? I assume not but&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; you can animate it using the rays <BR> <BR>Right - I can make them come up from the &quot;surface&quot;, or make them ripple laterally, or even have them as cones with a fly-through*. I did 3D animation for 8 years, although now I'm pretty rusty. <BR> <BR>* Yeah, make them orange, and have the slogan &quot;Neworld will help you navigate through obstacles&quot;&hellip;  ;-&gt; <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&quot;Technique&quot;: I guess it's a more contemporary way of saying &quot;craft&quot;. Like something you do to ensure long-term quality that might not be obvious. Like putting good kerning in a font. (BTW, no font stuff at Neworld - that's what The MicroFoundry does.) <BR> <BR>That button isn't supposed to be a button&hellip; But anyway, it's gone now. <BR> <BR>&gt; What about adding some kind of texture or phyical reference to the logo. <BR> <BR>That sounds like a good idea - although it might push my design skills beyond my abilities&hellip; I'll see what I can come up with. <BR> <BR>Domain names: I used to think a catchy domain name is very important. It might be for a Joe Shmoe using the web semi-randomly to find a megacorporation, but for highly focused operations that you could never employ by chance encounter, just throwing in a hyphen or something will avoid problems with existing names. So any decent domain name (with a pre/post-fix to &quot;neworld&quot;) would work fine in my case, I think. And if I go with a logo with a triple-u (&quot;ww&quot; when spelled out) that might help a lot. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Chris, I like your rendering with the triple-u! Pretty clever concept - definitely a strong candidate. It kinda looks like a bird, but most people like birds. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; dragging in Indian symbols and the sun is a mistake. <BR> <BR>1) American Indians are the old-timers of the New World - like me in my field. <BR>2) I'm Armenian, and our histories have strong parallels - so it has personal relevance*. I agree that shouldn't be made too important - but I think it's a nice, meaningful touch. And if I offend people who think the American Indians are just a bunch of drunkards who should have been wiped out totally (as opposed to the partial treatment they got&hellip;), and decide not to give me their business as a result, I think I can live with that. <BR> <BR>* You don't have to be part of a minority to feel a connection. Heck, many people (notably westerners) feel a strong connection with WHALES&hellip; It's like the Irish guy in The Commitments said: &quot;We're the niggers of Europe&quot;!  :-/ <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I do think that an Amerind reference shouldn't be too literal - which is why I didn't bother with that dark angular bird symbol - although Daniel brought a bird in anyway!  :-) <BR> <BR>Sharktooth is an interesting suggestion - thanks. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I would like to see some work done to enhance the readability somehow. Seeing the design for the 5th time it seems to vibrate just a little too much. <BR> <BR>I'm confused where you stop talking about the triple-u version and where you start talking about the rays one. BTW, I'm surprised that you guys really think the triple-u would be seen as a typo&hellip; You could never even type that!  :-) <BR> <BR>For the readability (of the rays, I'm assuming), wouldn't you say that I need to strike a balance between looking like rays versus looking like &quot;NEWORLD&quot;? I'm thinking if people see rays first and a second later see the name, maybe that's a <i>good</i> thing? <BR> <BR>For the &quot;vibration&quot; I'm sure you mean the rays one, but is it a <i>bad</i> vibration? The annoyance it generates, could it be slight enough to be &quot;a feature and not a bug&quot;? Hard for me to see &quot;from inside&quot;. That and the earlier version with the heavier outside rays give the logo a nice dynamism, a rawness, no? Dunno. I have an aversion to it looking too polished, too static. Do remember this is multimedia work (in terms of movement). <BR> <BR>You can tell I'm thinking out loud here. Hopefully that'll help me overcome my weaknesses in graphic design&hellip; <BR> <BR>BTW, I like your thinner and taller rays (I'd just have to negate the skew). <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Paul, interesting ideas - I'll see how far I can take them. I think I could create your combo triple-u/rays thing with positive/negative shapes instead of two colors. Hopefully it won't be too overloaded though. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

How about an old ship, or a compass, or a telescope, or something with longitude and latitude lines, or a sail. Could you get the w to look like a ship without being cheesy? Just some quick thoughts. Maybe start looking at old maps? I had an assignment once where we drew an aztec sundial, and we also did one about a compass, so maybe that's why those ideas are coming up for me.  <BR> <BR>(For any arc&hellip;It's like using helvetica really.

Maybe something alluding to a compass or a map would work though. And longitude/latitude lines might work too. Maybe a pair of perpedicular lines, bulging like they're wrapped on a sphere, with a circle/dot at the intersection. That would be nicely animatable. <BR> <BR>* Like I've always had the fruit in the back of my mind - it's nice and neutral, but not bland. <BR> <BR>&gt; N E W (world) are directional points. <BR> <BR>That's a great observation! Let me think about it. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Chris's design has been on my mind, but as funny as it might sound it seems too polished. A superb mark for a larger, prestigious operation, but maybe too &quot;slick&quot; for me - like the version of my rays with the &quot;perfect&quot; tapering - too static. I'm seeing if I can &quot;rough up&quot; Chris's idea though, and I'd like to figure out how animatable it is. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>There's been some great ideas here, thanks a lot.
