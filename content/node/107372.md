body: Is there any technical reason that a font should not have an apostrophe in its
  ID or filename?

  body: "What do you mean by \"ID\"?\r\n\r\nSome of the name fields involved in a
    font do not allow apostrophes, such as the PostScript font name.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    what do you mean by apostrophe? The typewriter mark, or a true curly apostrophe?"

    use, as long as one escapes the apostrophe properly in CSS. In practice, some
    browsers may have problems. For instance, FF25 doesn't like the name inside a
    single-quoted string, even when escaped. (Should probably file that as a bug.)
    Putting it in a double-quoted string works fine w/o escapes."

  body: "Do you really need to use the apostrophe in your font names/ID? The English
    language uses the apostrophe for possessives but most other languages get along
    fine without it. An apostrophe would not be helpful for non-English language customers.
    Indeed, in some jurisdictions the governments have active programs to eradicate
    product names that use the apostrophe. I decided not to use it for \"donshottype\"
    or any of my fonts for international reasons as much as for the problems with
    font field naming.\r\nDon"

  body: The name uses a term from a sci-fi pseudo-alien language. Of course, the way
    the writer made it look "alien" was to put apostrophes in odd places. It's probably
    not absolutely necessary to use it, but OTOH if it wouldn't cause problems, why
    not?

    that's odd. Of course, in Quebec, they have been eradicating signs in languages
