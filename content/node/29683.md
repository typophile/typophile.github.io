  the screenshots. I am trying to identify both the San Serif of the credits as well
  as the Serif on the medical diagrams in the background. \r\n\r\nAt first i thought
  the San Serif was Futura, but realised it was quite diffrent. Maybe its a variation?
  \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Really need a larger sample. Could be Futura after all.
