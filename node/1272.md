body: Do these exist in digital form already? I saw an image of the original 1925/27
  versions of Futura, and there&#39;s some really funky stuff &#40;g with triangle-shaped
  descender, r made from disjoint stroke and dot, etc&#41; that I&#39;d love to use
  in a poster I&#39;m working on.

  body: 'Hi Colin, <BR> <BR>There was a long discussion about Futura and its alternate
    characters and about  Berthold Univers BQ here: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/4651.html">
    http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/4651.html</a> <BR> <BR>As I state
    in my post about halfway down the page, with the type sample, I purchased the
    Foundry versions of Futura for the alternative characters, but what I&#39;ve been
    most impressed by and use most often are the f-ligatures. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also
    always loved Futura&#39;s oldstyle figures. I&#39;ve purchased the complete Berthold
    Futura in order to have these in all the various weights. I&#39;ve found the Berthold
    version to be excellent. <BR> <BR>Also check out the link from Tiffany: <BR> <BR><a
