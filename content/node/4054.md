  body: I really like the logo &#40;on the left&#41;! <BR>I think the &#34;ASITIS&#34;
    is taking away from it - try making it not italics and something more bland. <BR>

  body: Me too. <BR>It is nice, but too many things going on. <BR>You have to seek
    more integration between the mark and the logotype.

  body: Tell us about the name and what makes your company unique. As your logo looks
    now, it could be gerneric, there is no focus.

  body: 'If I had a great name such as you have I would not opt for a phony business
    name, especially for illustrations and design. You want to be taken seriously
    and there&#39;s nothing more convincing than having your God-given name identify
    you and your work. Furthermore, you don&#39;t need a logo that could paint you
    in a corner some day. Some really impeccable typography will do it so much better
    for you.  For a test, set Adam Stevenson in a number of ITC faces you have on
    your computer and experiment with escapement between characters to make it as
    readable as you can get it, and then ask anybody which version they prefer, the
    simple typographic solution or the logo you posted above. '

  body: I read your logotype as &#39;asitis&#39; &#40;pronounced &#39;as-eye-tis&#39;&#41;,
    which sounds like an inflammation to me, rather than &#39;As It Is&#39;, which
    is what I presume you actually want it to read as. <BR> <BR>If you want it to
    read as three words, I&#39;d emphasize that more in your logotype.
