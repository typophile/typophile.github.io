  body: Can't find a match and doubt actually there could be one. It feels custom
    to me, some serifs/stems look to have been chopped off. Reminds me also of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/cosmos-pro|Cosmos]]
    but that's not it. For what it's worth and if I have to reproduce it, I'd probably
    focus on and match /s and /e (the hardest letters to reproduce to me here) and
    start, for instance, with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carisma|Carisma]].
