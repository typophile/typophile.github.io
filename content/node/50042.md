  body: "I think the 'script' is hand-lettered. The old Photo-Lettering catalogs are
    full of similar script styles, but what I don't see are connecting r's like the
    one in \"sport\". That style of 'r' is more a print script style rather than connected
    script style. With no duplicated letters it's really impossible to be sure you
    are looking at a font and not hand lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
