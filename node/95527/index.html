  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Recently I’ve notices a bit of discussion about the demise of Typophile &amp;c. and I’ve detected a bit of a pattern: Rather than propose solutions, people seem to be bitching, moaning, arguing, leaving, and even deleting content. This thread is an attempt to help move things in a positive and productive direction:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deleting posts does render a thread somewhat useless, and will certainly cripple us. Obviously, the result is a terms of service agreement. Anyone have any lawyer friends?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today’s newbs are lacking. Agree, but why? One reason IMO, because we’re “well known suckers” for doing their homework. Just stop doing it and help them help themselves. You’re stunting their growth and pissing in your own pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search engine: find a coder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banner: find a no-Flash solution (and a coder)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Site re-design: Finish it. I will help. Just email me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content: Work on the Wiki. I can help. Just email me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moderators: if the were a more active presence, I believe this would help new users feel more comfortable participating lest they step into the middle of a cat-fight. This does of course raise the point of being mindful of of over-moderating, and deterring participation, but that doesn’t mean we can’t attempt to find a solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A “read more” link on long posts to avoid long scrolls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic turning of email addresses into links that launch an unwanted, and often unused, email client. This was considered poor practice 20 years ago.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please feel free to add more. An to those with the power to make any of these changes, my supervisor has a rule of sorts: “If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.” Many little changes can add up.</p>

<p>Personally, I think being able to edit any post is sketchy, as it pretty much screws the validity of the following responses. My vote would be for no editing, save for a 30 second “whoops” window. If you want to edit a comment, then simply make another post and the responses still hold true.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some random considerations:</p>
<ol><li>Time-limited editing of posts was already implemented (albeit it could be circumvent if one knew how) until the last “temp” iteration. However understandably this was applied to “comments”, not to thread-starting posts.
This happened before: features lost because of a “system upgrade”. Once were “smart” quotes, then “featured font” headings, and so on. Which brings me to the second point.</li>
<li>This site is built on Drupal. Drupal is hard. ![](/images/old-images/drupal-learningcurve_5673.jpg) Drupal is the typical example of something built to be everything to everyone, ending up being not enough for anyone.
So, you use plug-ins to add features. Then you upgrade Drupal and plug-ins stop working. Goodbye features.</li>
<li>Same problem with moderators. Forum moderators need specific, limited permissions. Probably this kind of privilegies management is built-in in forum software. Not so in Drupal. I know for sure that one reason there aren’t more moderators it’s because of this problem.</li>
<li>About the “read more link on long posts to avoid long scrolls”, please don’t. There is a (still*) working feature which is that if you click the “new” link (instead of the “title-of-thread” link) you will be sent to the first unread post on the thread.</li>
<li>I already have expressed, more than once, that the first, life-threatening issue which need to be addressed is the disappearance from search engines. The rest is secondary.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Except for threads with files attached to the initial post.</li>

I second this.  It would get rid of the freeloaders and earn some money for the site.  Not sure how it could be policed however.  You could set up a system for them to go through, but how would you keep them from just posting elsewhere on the site?</div>

About removing threads, that would be possible only if I were an actual moderator, which isn’t the case.
I’m just a regular user (albeit a diligent one ;-) and what I say doesn’t come from any inside knowledge, but merely from reading threads, observation, personal experience, and brief and occasional exchanges with actual moderators.
<p>Moreover, I’m against (at least in the present situation) the idea of charging for type IDs. It would cost less killing the “service” altogether.
But I’m all for clearly distinguish it from the rest of the site.</div>

<p>These are not simple challenges. I hope that Jared, et al., can find a way to successfully transition from a closed system to a more open one, if they so choose.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately, as you’re probably well aware Riccardo, that list is sorely out of date. Most of those folks stop by Typophile now only once every couple of weeks, it seems. Some haven’t been here in months. And Dan and Stephen (who have visited recently) have only partial privileges, which may not include spam moderation.</p>
<p>As far as I know, I’m the only person who regularly checks for spam: daily — at least once in the morning, sometimes more depending upon my day.</p>
<p>You won’t see my name on that Moderator list because when I volunteered I specifically told Jared I wasn’t interested or willing to be a moderator (i.e., an arbiter of behavior). And I didn’t want anyone contacting me with their problems.</p>
<p>I volunteered to be a Janitor and clean up spam, double-posts, etc., because at the time Typophile was having a major spam problem (and you thought it was bad now) and the only folks able to do anything about it all lived in the same time zone (Pacific, UTC -8). I live in Eastern, UTC -4, and Florian came on to pick up some of the slack in Berlin, UTC +1.</p>
<p>But in the past year or so, it looks like things have dropped back to only one time zone. So, depending upon when the spam gets posted, it may stay visible for up to 24 hours.</p>
<p>As it so happens, I’ve recently informed Jared and Joe that I will step down from my janitorial duties as of next weekend, Sept 1. It has become too much of a time suck and I wish to apply myself in other directions right now.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Jared has made any other arrangements yet. I certainly hope he does. I’ve put forward some suggestions. As I said before, I’m sure there will be no lack of volunteers. But it’s a matter of who the Punchcut guys wish to entrust and how they want to manage that. At the end of the day, it’s their site.</p>

<p>Based on my experience as a moderator in other forums, it&rsquo;s common for someone to volunteer with the best of intentions but then gradually drift away due to lack of time or other reasons.</p>
<p>It helps if you can clearly define the responsibilities of each moderator, and have one moderator in a supervisory position who makes sure things get done and who can pick a replacement moderator if an existing one drifts away.</p>
<p>Responsibilities need to be simple and realistic, considering that it&rsquo;s a volunteer position.</p>

<p>This thread is a response and call to action. Essentially, now try to follow me here, instead of talking about problems, lets try to actually <em>solve</em> them.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of ideas in here.</p>
<p>@ANYONE with ANY authority, has any action been taken, or are we still thinking about why things suck and complaining about them? Do we even plan on taking action? Should one of us simply build a new Typophile to replace this one?</p>
<p>Given the obvious and repeated nature of the problems here, new blood simply putting Typophile off the map wouldn’t be that hard. All the big-guns barely even talk, and by my count, 80% of the traffic here is font ID’s and homework help. Very little substance. Following tweets is more fruitful at this point.</p>
<p>I’d love to make Typophile 2.0 but I don’t know how to code. Any volunteers who’s care to help me?</p>

<p>I agree with Christophers comments regarding the current state of affairs&hellip;and twitter has indeed usurped typohile as my place to gain access to current trends or hot topics.

		<div class="commentbody">I myself spent more than a thought about the viability of a Kickstarter funding in order to reignite Typophile. It would  be beneficial from a technical perspective: make it works as a platform (which means the forum, but also typographic education, Type Battles, and, yes, Type ID too). One could also hope it would sparkle some publicity, raising a wider interest in Typophile.
But, apart from the difficulty of defining the scope of a Kickstarter project (and the reward tiers for backers, etc.), I think that, even if successful, in the long run it will not be a real solution.
As I see it, the main problem with Typophile (and any website for that matter), lies in maintenance. This means long term commitment and daily overseeing. And that’s not something one can really fund.</div>

<p>I thought the Typophile &lsquo;membership&rsquo; badges were supposed to fund maintenance and improvement. Perhaps they could be made more useful if non-badge people were limited in some way, for example in their maximum number of posts.</p>

<p>@riccardo0 agree with all your points, only I saw Typophile as more of a resource, rather than something which needed wider awareness (aside from educational purposes). Type battles, ID or any of that stuff have other services which do those things, and arguably better.
I guess I see it as a resource worth paying for - which again, should remove the major amount of maintenance? Which, as far as I&rsquo;m aware is mainly spam/erroneous postings/rogue users - surely a subscription model would go some way to removing? Or maybe invite/probation? I do realise I sound like a despot at this point&hellip;
Also, KickStarter would imply there is some profit to be made/shared&hellip;I can&rsquo;t believe that is a viable proposition. Although it&rsquo;s an excellent method to garner funding, I&rsquo;m sure there are other ways.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmm. What if Typophile created some sort of Pro-like subscription with an annual cost to be a member that has access to specific areas. Something like Type Directors Club, of course not as expensive.</p>
<p>I think Kickstarter is a great idea. Not just for revamping the site but also exposure. The rewards don&rsquo;t always have to be a physical product (special thank you on the site, free pro subscription, special access, etc). However, I honestly don&rsquo;t think T-shirts with the Typophile logo would be such a bad idea as one those rewards. Even a certificate for becoming a member. I don&rsquo;t know, just throwing out ideas.</p>
<p>What about ad revenue using a service like <a href="http://buysellads.com" target="_blank">BuySellAds.com</a>?</p>
<p>Surely there are people here who would be willing to do maintenance?</p>
<p>In saying all this, I have doubt that paying for help (ID) will only hurt the site rather than be beneficial. Others come here because of the knowledgeable resource.</p>

BTW, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a lack of exposure; virtually anybody who designs type -or even starts dabbling in it- already knows about Typophile, and I personally don&rsquo;t want to see an invasion of broader graphic design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably repeating myself here and there, but here are some things I&rsquo;d propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t panic.</li>
<li>Get the search working, or at least let Google back in.</li>
<li>If Google is given access again, figure out the spam situation.</li>
<li>Charge some sort of membership fee for heavy use.</li>
<li>Charge a nominal &ldquo;barrier&rdquo; amount for type ID requests.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to please everybody, certainly not pricks who don&rsquo;t even like the Internet and/or an open exchange of expertise/opinion to begin with. This is not a cocktail party.</li>

<p>No, but I have often thought that 2600 style meetings in the real world would be good fun with the Typophile crowd. Mustering a sufficient number of people in the same geographic location on a regular basis could be a little more difficult though&hellip;</p>
<p>Hrant, I remember seeing a video or some photos of you from one of the type conventions a few years ago taking your laptop onto the street to work on a font until the battery died, which is what made me think of it originally.</p>

<p>That was such strange fun. Eben Sorkin and I first did that during the LA TypeCon and were joined by a few more people (including a conference attendee by the name of Claire who initiated a great analog component) at the New Orleans TypeCon. LA: <a href="http://www.typecon.com/archives/69">http://www.typecon.com/archives/69</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/4911947563">http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/4911947563</a> NO: <a href="http://www.typecon.com/archives/400">http://www.typecon.com/archives/400</a> and <a href="http://www.typecon.com/archives/860">http://www.typecon.com/archives/860</a></p>
<p>Riccardo: I agree that more active participation would be great, but broader exposure of Typophile would probably simply dilute any discussions we do have, since it would draw in people who aren&rsquo;t really dedicated to type (because dedicated people already know about it).</p>

<p>After posting that I was having a drink in one of my favourite bars in London and stumbled across a comics group in the back room, mainly writers and artists, but soon discovered that Rian Hughes was there as well. I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to talk to him but being surrounded by that energy and enthusiasm was great. I agree, as far as Typophile goes, it is positive to mention what is happening here but it shouldn&rsquo;t be the focus and really I suppose that is what the various type conventions are for.</div>

They were meant to be a reminder that in order for any community* to survive (and hopefully thrive) there need to be a critical mass (however small) of people involved, and thus a certain rate of new people “replacing” those that became less present.
As for diluting (<a href="http://typophile.com/node/95976#comment-520672)">http://typophile.com/node/95976#comment-520672)</a>, the advantage of exposure would be to remind the people that already know about Typophile that it’s a good place to hang around. And with enough interested people (and some fair moderation), the specificity of the matters discussed would filter off the excessive noise.</p>

<p>In the 2 years or so that I&rsquo;ve been here, I&rsquo;ve never had the feeling that Typophile was welcoming to newcomers.</p>
<p>When new people introduce themselves, there&rsquo;s rarely much of a response. When students post a &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this font&rdquo; or &ldquo;help me with my homework&rdquo; post, they are viewed by some as a nuisance to be gotten rid of, rather than as potential members.</p>

<p>In my experience Typophile has treated new people with the same respect granted others, in that when a serious question is posed or discussion started, detailed and helpful responses are forthcoming. I have very limited experience with other web forums but I do not know what people expect from merely introducing themselves; if you walk into a room of a strangers, many of them professionals and all with a common interest, they will likely welcome you but if you have nothing to contribute and no questions, what more should you hope for?</p>
<p>As for font ID requests, there is a well established section of the forum to deal with those.</p>
<p>In my fairly limited experience in the wider font community, most people working in the industry have had to learn everything from the ground up, learning and often innovating new technologies as they go. This is knowledge that people are generally willing to share but only when it comes to people that are interested in pushing their own understanding further. When people come on here asking for the benefit of knowledge that everyone else has worked hard to acquire, without appreciating how to get there or why, I am not surprised that responses are limited.</p>

<p>I am indeed. I don&rsquo;t want to de-rail this thread but happy to arrange meeting for beer and type discussion. I will look at setting up something along the lines of what hrant has already done but for London, in the [[http://typophile.com/forum/2|Special Interest Groups]].</p>
<p>Nick, those are fine ideas. While getting anyone paid for their time through the site is probably unlikely, the idea of more specific mentorship for those willing (and not already doing so) would no doubt appeal to a number of people here. This site probably represents the single greatest technical typographic resource on the web, fully indexed and searchable it would be a formidable resource and when it was indexed by Google that is pretty much what it was.</p>

<p>Karl, I guess my comment was aimed more at the moderators. In forums where I&rsquo;ve been a moderator, we always tried to make newcomers feel welcome.</p>
<p>Years ago I made my first post at a different forum. I accidentally violated forum etiquette and was blasted by a long-time member. I was so embarrassed that I decided never to post again, but then a forum moderator posted a friendly welcome and invited me to continue participating, so I did, and eventually I became a moderator.</p>
<p>Newcomers often feel awkward, don&rsquo;t know what to say, and often make mistakes. A little friendly encouragement and guidance can sometimes help them through that initial rough period and lead to them becoming good members of the group.</p>

<p>I agree that making newcomers welcome is the best approach and one likely to encourage contribution and involvement, I suppose I am focusing on those posts where people are simply declaring their presence when this has always felt like a very hands on forum where the best approach is to jump in.</p>
<p>I know that I have made mistakes myself but have always just moved on while trying to understand where I went wrong, but I suppose silence and a lack of encouragement can be intimidating.</p>

<p>Your initial post which started this thread contained 9 points, and 2 of them concerned newcomers.</p>
<p>In #2 you said &ldquo;Today’s newbs are lacking&hellip; Just stop doing [their homework]&hellip;&rdquo;  (The majority of these students are newcomers.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Random thoughts:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there was more money available that things would change. Convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>Every iteration of Typophile, no matter how &ldquo;improved,&rdquo; hobbled or disabled something that was well liked and fully functional. How long do you expect loyal and long-time users to put up with that?</p>
<p>I used to subscribe to a newsletter about English language usage, but the price was high. Even worse, the articles were so damned &ldquo;correct&rdquo; they were boring and uninteresting. So I never renewed. I do subscribe to a computer newsletter (Windows Secrets), which has a free section and a paid section. I subscribe to the paid section, and users determine how much to contribute. I used to go to the NY Times daily. Now I only go there as a result of a search, or a link from another site.</p>
<p>Should Typophile remain free? A &ldquo;first 10 posts&rdquo; free model would not prevent one-time annoyances or do-my-homework posts. How about read free and contribute what you will to post for a year (with a $X [$2-5?] minimum, and with &ldquo;membership badges&rdquo; for those who contribute over a certain amount.) I was recently directed to a site that said something like &ldquo;You have to be registered to read this article. Registration is free.&rdquo; It annoyed the crap out of me. Since I already had the answer I wanted, reading the article was for my own information and pleasure, and the site was one I wouldn&rsquo;t come back to, I declined to register. Others may have higher or lower annoyance levels.</p>
<p>Would someone please explain (or point me to an explanation) of just what the relationship is between Punchcut and Typophile?</p>
<p>What makes Typophile so wonderful are the people on it; what makes it so bad is the dysfunction of the web design. Based on the website, I&rsquo;d never use Punchcut for anything.</p>
<p>As for Search, what about using Google Toolbar with the &ldquo;Search this site&rdquo; function?</p>
<p>Pissing contests and rancor come with the territory. Really obnoxious or serial offenders should be warned, and barred if persistent.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s impossible for a moderator to read every single post (to find inappropriate/offensive material), how about a &ldquo;Report&rdquo; link on the bottom of posts?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need people like that,&rdquo; &ldquo;get rid of the freeloaders,&rdquo; are attitudes that will kill Typophile.</p>
<p>Require all posts to be previewed; that will reduce the need to edit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Hrant: Search: I asked Google to re-index over a week ago. There&rsquo;s a bigger problem on our side where the engine is not indexing the forum content. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out why.</p>
<p>@RenMan: Typophile runs pretty much independently from Punchcut. Punchcut pays the bills and ensures that Typophile is always here for the community to enjoy. We work on it whenever we can, but look to the collective Typophile community to help shape and define what Typophile is, visually and culturally. It&rsquo;s been that way since Day 1 and I expect it always will be.</p>
<p>Acknowledged, the site needs lots of work. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>Typophile was created to share knowledge in a welcoming, sharing atmosphere. We were all students once, so we could stand to be much more tolerant of new members of our community.</p>
<p>And remember, every family reunion has the crazy aunt or uncle. While they might be quirky or annoying, we love them and accept them nonetheless.</p>
<p>I expect we&rsquo;d explore every other fund-raising option before charging users for access.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, here&rsquo;s my 2 cents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Charging for the website is ridiculous. I would prefer to have ads or to give a donation in order for the thing to go on. Segregating knowledge: no way. I believe that this is a forum, not a club. And if Punchcut is supporting this website, here I go: THANK YOU, PUNCHCUT!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the newcomers and topics that are not-so-relevant, maybe a restructuring of the different forums could help. As Jared told, we were once students as well. And we also asked &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; questions, that might have seemed obvious, but we needed to ask in order to learn. How about a sub-forum dedicated to newbies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the homepage, the former one was way better. If the problem is flash, do it in HTML. Done. Solved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the overall design (the current one) is confusing. Very confusing. Jared, if you need a helping hand, please ping me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guys, if you&rsquo;re still around this forum, that&rsquo;s because you had good experiences here. I found lots of good stuff here, personally. Got helped. Helped some. Isn&rsquo;t this something worth preserving and improving?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree. It should be a cheap and easy first step to hide the names of all boards listed below the type ID board. Put them in a menu that’s closed by default. Maybe the guidelines could be excluded, but nobody reads them anyway, so I think it would be best to keep this one entry visible: ‘Type ID Board’. Or at least get everything below ‘Solved IDs’ (i.e. categories like ‘Sans Serif’ that seem to mislead so many people) out of sight. The type ID board might not be the most relevant part of the forum, but it’s the most popular one and all the miscategorised postings suck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bendy, R.:</p>
<p>When the subfora with categories for solved IDs were introduced, our input was requested: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/65232">http://www.typophile.com/node/65232</a>
I spoke out against it, and everybody else did so, too: unnecessary, not helpful, overcomplicating and slowing down things, etc. Nevertheless, this new ‘feature’ was not removed.</p>
<p>The topic came up again later: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/71918">http://typophile.com/node/71918</a>
Again, I said: “let’s get rid off the ‘Solved IDs’ fora.” 
Nothing has happened, no reaction whatsoever.</p>
<blockquote>
it's common for someone to volunteer with the best of intentions but then gradually drift away due to lack of time or other reasons. — <a href="http://typophile.com/node/95527?from=0&comments_per_page=5000#comment-520143">JamesM</a></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what has happened in my case. I used to administrate the Type ID Board for quite a while, on a daily base. Occasionally, I could help Kent out a little with the spam squashing. Recently, I am lacking both time and motivation to continue to do so.</p>
<blockquote>As it so happens, I’ve recently informed Jared and Joe that I will step down from my janitorial duties as of next weekend, Sept 1. It has become too much of a time suck and I wish to apply myself in other directions right now. — <a href="http://typophile.com/node/95527?from=0&comments_per_page=5000#comment-520127">Kent</a></blockquote>
<p>I will do the same. Yes, maybe I should have announced this first, before quitting the admin work. Well, I had hoped that things would improve over time, and that I would be on hiatus only. (And theoretically, there are at least 2 more Type ID admins.) But since search engines stopped indexing Typophile, my admin work has become even more tedious and, to some extent, technically impossible – think of linking to similar threads, looking up existing information, etc. My impression is that the amount of time and effort is totally disproportionate to the benefit for the ID requesters and the fellow IDers. 
I am not a masochist.</p>
