<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Over the years I have used both Suitcase and ATM. It seems many of my fonts that used to work now come up corrupt. They work if I activate them in spite of the font utility warning. Some fonts don't work anymore at all. I don't believe anything happened to the fonts at all. I think the font management software has become more fussy about certain font issues over the years. For instance, I have a collection of old fonts called OPTIfonts all of those report as damaged but they work. I am confused about why good fonts go bad or report they are bad. Also I have tried font doctor and that doesn't seem that great. Maybe I don't use the right settings. Are there other ways to fix fonts?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Welcome to living with the consequenses of the rip-roaring, fast flyin' type explosion of the nineties!
You see, when digitla type was young, there were only major companies releasing "professional" type-1 PostScript fonts, under license from Adobe, and the format was protected and inaccessible (for the most part)... so it still took a lot of time and effort to produce faces, and quality control was a decent part of that. True, there were "type-3" PostScript fonts, fully editable/accessible, but they were few and faw between (or complete cr*p).
Then came Fontographer... it only worked with type-3 fonts, but grew to enable Truetype and Type-1 as those formats opened up. Fontographer was cheap, (relatively) easy, and opened up a world of fonts... it seemed that fonts were popping up everywhere! Add to that the consolidation/expansion of all the "traditional" libraries as typesetting became exclusively PC territory (when's the lst time anyone spec-ed a galley of type around hre?), and Voilá! A world of digital type accessible to all!
But the dark sde of the tale is that many, many fonts (and not just the cheapies) had subtle but real encoding errors. The PostScript Type-1 format has a lot of error-checking built in, but wasn't perfect; now Opentype is here, and there's tons of places things can go wrong. The latest utilities do a much better job of identifying problems with fonts, but they do tend to "go overboard" at times -- better to flag a questionable font than to let it wreak havoc.
Remember too that fonts are (IMHO) the number ONE culprit in "mystery" system crashes. It's not that a font doesn't "work"... it's got to play nice with all the other fonts (conflicts) and the sytem itself. There's got to be something there when the system asks for a particular glyph.
Again, it's not just the cheapo fonts at fault here. Adobe would never admit that some of their early faces had issues, but they used the OpenType conversion as an opportunity to address a lot of those. Ever look at the outlines from the "original" Type-1 Helvetica? EEK!
Your best bet is to A) try re-installing fonts from your original source discs (fonts CAN become damaged over time and use); B) update to the latest version of FontDoctor (or other checker utility); C) run all your fonts through the utility again (make sure they're not installed at the time); D) try reinstalling and running them.
If you're still getting errors, it's time to loook for a replacement. Contact the manufacturer (with a receipt) if you can, they should be able to send you a replacement or update. Or upgrade to the newest version. I'm slowly replacing my workhorse families with the latest OpenType releases, and it's d*mn pricey, but I figure I gotta do it 'til I bite the bullet and pop for the full Library release (the latest Adobe Font Folio - 11 - is "only" 3 grand, if I see it go on sale I might just have to go for it).
As much as you may not want to hear it, some fonts really should be "put to sleep"... they're old, worn out, or cr*p to begin with. It hurts to throw them away, but you gotta do it sometimes. Think about it... you wouldn't try to install or run MacDraw 1.0 on a dual-core intel MacPro, but you expect the fonts you used back then to still run perfectly. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow, thanks for the info. Wouldn't that be a dream... a full library of new fonts! Better than diamond earrings! I have to admit I make do with a hodge podge of fonts collected over the years. It's a very sad state of affairs. It's like I'm still wearing 80s cloths!</div>
