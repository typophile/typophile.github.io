    is better.  Try a strong slab serif and see how that feels before you go setting
    three different kinds of type into one or two words.  You can have two faces that
    compliment each other, but it's not the first place you should look, IMHO."

    these have a very strong concept, and they seem arbitrary and random at best.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>I
    wanted to use varying typeface to represent the diversity of the area being covered.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    don't think this is a good idea. Maybe try using different weights of the same
    typeface. I'd go with a sans serif.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>Don\u2019t know if I want
    to spend the time developing a icon to go with it, as nothing comes to mind really.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    might be worth it, since these are all quite bland and uninteresting. A simple
    mark would help you out.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>Also the spelling of the word... Northeastender,
    North East Ender, North-East Ender, Northeast Ender??</cite>\r\n\r\nTalk to your
    client about this one. They'll probably know better than us :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    That could make a nice tidy little mark. Use all cap sans serif. Never sacrifice
    aesthetics for concept. That's what you are doing with the idea of mixing typefaces
    to speak of the diversity. Not saying you couldn't achieve both aesthetic and
    concept, but right now in your pursuit of this concept, you haven't acheived an
    acceptable aesthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful and something ugly almost
    always works."
