body: Greetings, <BR> <BR>I am trying to make a Type1 Logo Font, with FontLab 4.6
  on Mac OS X. <BR> <BR>To get the best possible result &#40;details&#41;, I am using
  a UPM value of 5000. If I could, I would go even higher. Does this makes sense or
  am I off track. Is there a limit on UPM value one can use? At a value of 1000, the
  shapes gets distorted while at 5000, this is almost perfect. <BR> <BR>In Suitcase
  &#40;OS X&#41; I just can&#39;t see the glyph I assigned to the letter &#34;B&#34;.
  Is there an easy way to generate this Type1 font for Mac?  <BR> <BR>What would be
  the most important parameters to use &#40;in FontLab -- Font Info&#41;, to make
  sure it works OK? <BR> <BR>Kind Regards, <BR> <BR>Yves

  body: FWIU no matter what UPM you use in the design space, once you make a Type1
    font it is converted to a 1000 UPM so by working at 5000, you will introduce rounding
    errors. <BR> <BR>If the logo is that detailed that 1000 UPM wokspace make it distorted,
    it may be best to keep in in an importable eps format. <BR> <BR>Or make a TrueType
    version of the logo, working at 2048 and with FontLab you can hint the Bejeezes
    out of it to control its small size rendering. <BR> <BR>James

  body: Huh. That&#39;s an unfortunate limitation. The Type 1 format itself supports
    arbitrary UPM values &#40;though 1000 is what people almost universally use&#41;.

  body: So maybe I&#39;m wrong. I&#39;ve just always found that font deitors export
    Type1 at 1000 upm. Is there a work around. <BR>

  body: 'I have a logo font here, that I created a while back when I was on Mac OS
    9.2 or 8.5. Never had troubles with it until I moved to OS X. I was using it principaly
    for my invoices in FileMaker. I would then output the FileMaker invoice to a PDF
    file, where my Logo Font was embedded. This, gave a more interesting finish than
    importing an eps in FileMaker. It was a question of antialiasing. I did many tests
    and never succeeded to import a vector graphic in FileMaker that would output
    as vectors. It seems it always convert the file to a pict. <BR> <BR>Since I moved
    to OS X, that font is not working anymore and I don&#39;t understand why. Wish
    someone could explain me why. <BR> <BR>To make a test, I just opened in FontLab
    4.6 this working Type 1 LogoFont &#40;the PS file&#41; I created a while back,
    and in the Info, the UPM shows to be 5882.  <BR> <BR>I have the feeling that something
    has changed in OS X and I don&#39;t know what and why...? <BR> <BR>What I liked,
    and that was sort of usefull, is the negative kerning, where the combination of
    different keys was giving me the possibility to use a mask underneath the logo,
    and to color differently each parts, depending on the visual application. <BR>
    <BR>If anyone interested... give me a ring and I&#39;ll send you the LogoFont
    to check. <BR> <BR>I feel I have been struggling with this issue since too long
    now. I discovered this forum yesterday and said to myself: &#34;If no one has
    the answer here... you will never have any&#34;. <BR>  <BR>This forum seems to
    be the good place to ask for help. <BR> <BR>Kind Regards, <BR> <BR>Yves'

  body: Actually, this was reported as a bug to the FontLab folks a while back. I
    just tested it in FontLab 4.6.1 and it seems to work fine! <BR> <BR>I took Myriad
    Pro Italic, set the em square to 2200, didn&#39;t scale the glyphs, and exported
    as a &#40;renamed&#41; Type 1. The resulting font behaves as I would expect. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I created it in 2001 with FontLab 3.1. <BR>Never had trouble using it,

    in FreeHand but now in FreeHand MX... no way. Samething in FileMaker. Can&#39;t
    use it. It shows up as bitmap, and when trying to convert it to paths in FreeHand,
    it seems it can&#39;t find the PS file even if it is located in the same folder
    as the suitcase file. <BR> <BR>Questions, Questions, Questions... <BR> <BR>There
    seems to be some Gremlins under the OS X hood. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>Yves

  body: 'Nope, I&#39;m not on OS X myself. Sorry for missing this point earlier. So
    two questions: <BR> <BR>- does the tool support making such fonts? <BR>- do they
    work in OS X? <BR> <BR>If they don&#39;t work in OS X, that would be an OS X bug.
    It would not be the first significant OS X problem that causes perfectly good
    fonts to not work.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Years ago, when I first tried making Type 1 fonts with arbitrary UPM values,
    I did find that some PS emulations in printers gagged on anything other than 1000.
    Not sure whether this would be a live issue.
