  body: "> <em>2. When was Gill Sans digitized?</em>\r\n\r\nYou mean, when was Gill
    Sans <em>first</em> digitized?\r\nMost likely in the mid-nineteen-seventies during
    the early years of Dr. Peter Karow's development and expansion of the  [[IKARUS]]
    type digitizing system. Do you need hard dates?\r\n\r\nFonts were digitized even
    BEFORE high-end digital type-imagesetters were available. The IKARUS system was
    used initially for CAD/CAM expansion of type families by interpolating weights.\r\n\r\nBy
    the late 1970s, the first digital typesetting equipment came into production,
    and vector/spline outlines were used for font data. This was all before Macintosh
    was even a \"seed\" in Job's eye!"

    body: "Thanks Norbert, \r\nmore specifically  I was wondering when the nowadays
      available version of Gill Sans MT was digitized? Assuming there was a specific
      time that it took place.\r\n\r\nI'm preparing a small sample comparing the differences
      of metal set and computer set Gill Sans. No hard dates are necessary, but welcome
      :D\r\n"

  body: "Gill Sans has a history prior to the drawings he did for Monotype dating
    from the period he worked with Edward Johnston, which, he acknowledged, influenced
    the forms that he introduced into his sans face. According to Fiona MacCarthy's
    biography the first recognisable samples of Gill Sans was used in hand painted
    signs at Capel-y-ffin and later 1926 (or 1927) for Douglas Cleverdon's shopfront,
    the uppercase drawings for Monotype were dated 1927 and lowercase 1928. Morison
    apparently commissioned the work in 1927.\r\nTim"
