body: I am looking for a font, very very close to Poetica Chancery 1 in nature, but
  the lower-case "w" has 4 upper terminals, similar to the capital "W". I'm trying
  to re-create a logo for an client that lost all their digital files. It was suggested
  by Extensis to give you guys a try so thanks in advance.

  body: Oh, I love Schneidler Italic! It looks like it's been slightly altered - perhaps
    redrawn by hand, even?

    body: OH WOW, that is it! Thank you so much! I'm sure it was manipulated somewhat
      in PhotoShop but I can handle that. Thanks again, what a great resource!
