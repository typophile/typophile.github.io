  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I'm starting to dabble in type design and have been messing around with the calligraphic brushes in illustrator.

 I've skeletoned out some letter forms with lines and curves. I would now like to apply a calligraphic stroke, but I would like the nib/tip of the calligraphic brush to be a rounded rectangle and not oval shaped. There doesn't seem to be an advanced options area for calligraphic brushes. I almost reached the affect by making the rounded rectangle shape into a scatter brush and reducing the spacing, but the minimum spacing is 10% (I would need 0%).

Is there any way to create this affect? Is there any way to create a calligraphic brush with a custom shaped nip/tip?

Thanks in advance.

Jason, typographic letterforms are not "expanded skeletons".
It might be tempting to think of the process you're following
as adequate for a beginner; I'd counter that it's a damaging
foundation for future development.

Try to think of a font as a collection of black <em>and</em>
white shapes that "talk to each other" to form words.

Parametic/generative fonts are one of my favorite things.
But they don't have to be skeleton-based: http://typophile.com/node/73827

James, it's not fair to call people like me non-designers.

Type design is not a fine art, it's a craft, like architecture or furniture design.

What fine arts training do you have that includes type design training? Unless you have *specifically" studied type design (whether formally or not), you don't know how to approach it. This doesn't mean you shouldn't, or shouldn't learn. Note also that type design is not the same thing as calligraphy.

Modern typefaces are pretty much *all* created in computer programs. It's just that most type designers use dedicated type design programs to do it. Maybe half of them do sketches first, and about as many do not.
