body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nAs well as working in education as a designer, I'm an MA Design
  Studies student at Central St Martins and am conducting research into typography.
  I'm posting today to see if anyone here might be able to help out with my MA research.\r\n\r\nThe
  title of my project is \"Life according to type\" and is an exploration into how
  designers can use art as a vehicle for typography to interpret the world around
  them.\r\n\r\nTo explain a little more, the project first took form as a way of gaining
  insight into how legibility and accessibility were affecting typography, how say
  increased restrictions from certain groups force the designers hand in typographical
  choices (sight disorders, learning disabilities, etc.) and moved into how to keep
  the variation in typography alive.\r\n\r\nThe research aims to look into using typography
  as a means for expressing the surrounding world, collaboration amongst the design
  community and for myself curating design/art exhibitions online and in galleries.\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping to find designers to take part in my research, ideally people who possibly
  may be able/willing to create a piece of tyopgraphical art which would then be used
  as as a demonstration/example of my research aims.\r\n\r\nI'm also conducting research
  into how guideline restrictions from groups forces design choices when it comes
  to typography, as well as personal views of designers on this subject.\r\n\r\nIf
  you know of anyone else that may be able/want to help then please do either let
  me know or pass my details on.\r\n\r\nFor more information or expressions of interest
  I can be contacted at either contact@christophernallen.com or cnallen@hotmail.co.uk
  as well as via Typophile.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your time in reading this
  and I look forward to hopefully hearing from some of you soon.\r\n\r\nChris Allen."

  body: "I had considered lettering, but decided to concentrate on digital type. Whether
    the designer creating the piece then translates that type into a physical (drawn,
    sculpted, etc.) form is entirely up to them as long as they reference the original
    digital typeface as it is more about keeping the variation in typography alive
    and I feel that this affects digital more so. I welcome your thoughts on the subject
    however.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChris."
