body: "Even through is generally accepted that \"design follows function\", there's
  an undeniable trend of using too much white space in book layouts. Is useful sometimes,
  but it can also looks like a cheat to spend less time diagramming text correctly
  and charge more by using more pages. It seems that most students down here actually
  don't like to use forced white space when they enter to the college, yet teachers
  encourage to \"lose the fear\" to it.\r\n\r\nI know that a particular advocate [[http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2010/02/kid-page-layouts.html|agaisnt
  it]] is the cartoonist John Kricfalusi, which has a very neat blog ([[http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com|John
  K Stuff]]) with a lot of critique of contemporary art, design and drawing advice.
  Writer Amid Amidi and him were working on a book of his art for about 3 years, yet
  has been put on hiatus due to having working with a designer that used a somewhat
  bland layout with white space and all ([[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/why-there-isnt-a-spumco-coffeetable-book-my-personal-story.html|Full
  story and images]]). While I mostly agree with John K views, it kinds of discourages
  me that the layout they rejected, or at least what was shown, wasn't really <em>that</em>
  atrocious and looks like the thing most of my college teachers always approve.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  your opinion about white space in book layouts, or 'minimalism' in general?"

    whitespace as a surface for note-taking. And since I rarely if ever take notes
    on that surface...\r\n\r\nIn some books, big whitespace is just too distracting.
    Luckily, the mongo-droolworthy \"Aeroplanes over Iceland\" has very little whitespace.
    Sadly, that means I gotta wear a bib so's not to slobber over the pix."

  body: "> I guess it was more an example of \"hierarchy\" in text.\r\n\r\nOkay, perhaps
    so, although taking a quick look at his blog many of the layouts he seems to like
    look rather cluttered to me. But I'll admit that I  like some of those retro layouts
    in spite of the clutter. :)\r\n\r\nBy the way, here's a funny parody article that
    touches on the idea of simplicity and white space. It takes a classic Volkswagen
    ad and totally destroys it through a series of logical-sounding \"improvements\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/49807278/9-Ways-to-Improve-an-Ad-by-Fred-Manley-and-Hal-Riney\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/improve-ad_5727.jpg]"

  body: "I think that, for years now, the trend has been toward more white space--both
    via generous margins an increased leading--for more comfortable readability. Remember
    that the printed book is not just a container, but can be an art object independent
    of the book's writing and subject.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine a professional book
    designer/page compositor using white space to increase the number of pages ...
    at least not if he or she intends to work regularly.\r\n\r\nDecreased white space
    makes for a cluttered look and certainly inhibits sense and reading comprehension.
    Increased white space is only \"not valid\" when it's so much as to decrease readability.
    And it takes quite a lot of white space for that."

  body: It doesn't? I dunno, but 18+ years of book design suggests otherwise to my
    eye. And more importantly, to my paying clients' eyes. I must admit to not being
    such a design snob, that my peers' acceptance is so very important. I mean, I
    guess--for better or worse--I'm kind of a mercenary and measure my acceptance
    by paying clients.

    for page count and what word count the final manuscript comes in with. There\u2019ve
    been plenty of times when I\u2019ve had to push a book out. And plenty of times
    trying to rein it in. All variables are fair game. It\u2019s all a balancing act."
