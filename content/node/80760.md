body: Is there an easy way in FontLab to change (or assign) multiple glyph name suffixes
  (like glyphname.alt1, glyphname.alt2, ...) to a range of glyphs at once?

    and run the renamer macro. You have to create txt documents of the from>to names.
    There is possibly an easier way.

  body: In addition to the 'Rename Glyphs by Scheme' script to which Claus pointed,
    Adam also made a 'Rename Glyphs by Regex' (Regular Expressions). I don't know
    if this is available anywhere at the moment, but it is very useful. Regular Expressions
    allows one to apply complex name changing rules, targeting not only the end of
    name, but also the beginning, and various wildcards.
