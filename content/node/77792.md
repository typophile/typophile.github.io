body: I have received a support request for a PS flavored OTF family we recently sold,
  saying that it cannot be installed in Font Book. I have no problems whatsoever doing
  it on 10.6 and cannot replicate the problem, but the customer is on 10.5.8 - are
  there any known bugs with PS OTFs and that version of OS X? Resetting the font cache
  didn't help, either.

  body: "Font Book is extremely picky about what it considers to be errors that make
    font unusable and often does not actually explain the problem. When testing my
    fonts I sometimes have to scour warnings in MS Font Validator and FontQA to find
    what non-problem Fontbook\u2019s developers decided represents total font corruption.
    \r\n\r\nThe version difference is probably because Fontbook was overhauled for
    10.6 to make it a less horrible piece of software but I don\u2019t think that
    Apple backported some of the bug fixes. It may be that your font is fine and that
    the problem is just bugs in older versions of Fontbook and that the customer will
    have to either upgrade to 10.6 or buy a decent font management app. This is one
    of those circumstances where designers have to educate clients that the actual
    quality of Apple\u2019s software is far less than what the public perceives it
    to be."

  body: "I agree with you that it's a completely unusable piece of software for professional
    use, but I find it hard to tell a customer that I can't do anything about it.
    There's not even an error message when she tries to add it, it just does nothing,
    with seems weird.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll have to tell her to just buy a decent font
    management software \u2013 all the free ones I've seen are less than perfect for
    professional use."

  body: "I use Fontbook all the time and never have any problems. I use it to install
    all of the fonts I make and they all do just fine. I've been using it for years
    now and have never understood why so many people hate it. \r\n\r\nI also use FontAgent
    Pro on occasion and that appears to be OK, but LinoType's FontXplorer X or whatever
    it is called these days never worked for me at all. A real piece of crap IMO."

    her mistake ;) her font book will not let her install any new fonts at all. Good
    for me, bad for her.'

  body: "Two potential sources of problems with OTFs on Mac OS X (esp. 10.5 and earlier)
    are: \r\n1. Subroutine compression: Mac OS X sometimes fails to decompress subroutines
    properly. Generate a font without subroutinization and try if that works. \r\n2.
    Too long glyph names in the font (in total): Mac OS X imposed a limit on the overall
    length of all glyphnames in the font. However, to hit that limit, your font needs
    to have at least 2,500-3,000 glyphs. If that's the case, shorten the glyph names
    as much as possible (use one-letter suffixes for OpenType alternates, and the
    uXXXX notation for encoded glyphs). \r\n\r\nI've been using Linotype FontExplorer
    X Pro since its very first version, and love it. It deals very well with duplicates
    (e.g. same-named fonts in various formats), where FontBook gets confused. The
    only feature I'm still missing from Font Explorer (and having asked for it for
    many times) is the ability to search within character sets (as in: show me all
    the fonts that have a glyph for \"\u0436\"). You'd think it's absolutely trivial,
    but I haven't seen any single font management application that would allow that.
    \r\n\r\n"
