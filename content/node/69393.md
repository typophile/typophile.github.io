  on a typewriter....i have an old Olivetti Class typewriter but because of the amount
  of text and potential last minute changes ect typing all out on that, scanning it
  ect ain't really that practical...\r\n\r\nthere are so many typwiter fonts out there
  i was wondering if anyone could recommend a really good one...\r\ni don't want anything
  too grungy or that looks too antique and corroded, nothing too over the top or ancient
  looking, but at the same time it does have to look real ( it shouldn't be perfectly
  clean)....\r\n\r\nim looking for something like on this CD sleeve....\r\n\r\ncan
  anyone recommend anything????\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/R-137787-1166462595_4985.jpg]"
