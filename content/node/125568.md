  body: Typophile became so very unusable and plagued with spam, that I hardly use
    it once a week and am always disappointed. Too bad its design hasn't been discussed
    with others. We do have a critique community for this. So before endeavouring
    into redesign (and killing the community in the meantime being off for such a
    long time) we could design it together while the old forum was still working and
    then embark into this great unknown.
