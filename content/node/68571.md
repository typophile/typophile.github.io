  body: "Something funny is going on with the connection points. Notice how the baseline
    moves as if each letter is being placed separately. It does look like a font,
    but maybe one that doesn't connect this well (?)\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this
    is a custom (one off) script font that was done quickly, perhaps to make it look
    more casual, or because of lack of experience. Then the letters were different
    sizes and slants and had to be fitted together to make them look like connected
    script.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
