  I&#39;m not using any font management software, just dragging and dropping. When
  I try to install multiple bitmap files, after the first file is installed, it won&#39;t
  let the rest of the bitmap files install. Is there a way/program to consolidate
  the bitmap fonts into one file? Is this the problem? '

  body: Matthew,  <BR> <BR>what exactly are you trying to install on Windows? Mac
    Type 1 fonts? Or Windows Type 1 fonts? Windows Type 1 fonts don&#39;t have any
    sort of &#34;bitmap files&#34;.  <BR> <BR>The primitive necessity to have mandatory
    bitmaps along with Type 1 fonts is a MacOS-only limitation.  <BR> <BR>MacOS supports
    Mac Type 1 fonts &#40;suitcases with LWFN printer files&#41;. Windows supports
    Windows Type 1 fonts &#40;.pfb and .pfm files&#41;. Please be more specific on
    what you are trying to achieve, on what &#40;exactly&#41; system and how you are
    proceeding &#40;step by step&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: They are Windows type 1 fonts in one family. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m running MS Windows
    2000. <BR> <BR>So, I think the problem is that I&#39;m trying to install bitmap
    fonts when windows doesn&#39;t need them. To get this straight, I only need to
    install the .pfm and .pfb files for the fonts to work right? I was putting in
    the .fon and .24 sized bitmaps also. <BR> <BR>Also, for the kerning to work, will
    I need to drag the .afm file in there as well? <BR> <BR>Sorry for the noobish
    windows font questions.

    <BR>PFB &#43; AFM &#43; INF <BR> <BR>The PFB file contains the outlines. The other
    files contain metrics, kerning and other information. The PFM essentially contains
    the same information as the AFM and INF, but in a different form. The PFM is always
    what is registered as an installed font &#40;although both it and the PFB are
    actually installed&#41;; if you install using the AFM &#43; INF combination, Windows
    will generate a PFM during the install process. <BR> <BR>

  body: The only reason to install ATM Light on Windows 2000 &#40;or XP&#41; is if
    you need support for &#34;multiple master&#34; Type 1 fonts. <BR> <BR>Also, if
    you&#39;ve installed and deinstalled some older version of ATM Light, you may
    have broken Windows native support for both Type 1 and PostScript flavored OpenType
    fonts. You&#39;ll know because you won&#39;t be able to install them and will
    get error messages. In that case, you need to install a patch available from Adobe
    to fix the problem. Installing the latest ATM &#40;Light or Deluxe&#41; will also
    fix the problem. <BR> <BR>T

    for ATM Light. That also has a link to the updater for ATM Deluxe. Read the details
    there, but this patch is also what you need if you uninstalled an older version
    of ATM Light or Deluxe.'

  body: I recently designed a brochure on my MACG4 using Illustrator. I originally
    thought the client wanted me to send the files to press, however I learned after-the-fact
    that they were going to print from their destop-printer and gbc-bind for their
    presentations. They couldn&#39;t use my MAC fonts and I purchased fonts from FONTS.COM
    that matched my font names... the client could use a few of them, the ones that
    came in with .TTF &#40;True Type Fonts&#41;, however a couple of the most important
    fonts came in as Windows Postscript Fonts. The client couldn&#39;t install for
    some reason on his PC. QUESTION. If I buy OpenType Fonts with same names as my
    original fonts, can I use them on both my MAC and their PC platforms? Also, is
    it possible to use TrueType on the MAC... I always thought NO, but who knows?

  body: 'Tar: <BR> <BR>Apple invented TrueType, and all the Mac system fonts are TrueType,
    so you can definitely use TrueType on a Mac! However, both Type 1 and TrueType
    fonts come in Mac and Windows flavors. Mac OS X can use Windows style TTF fonts,
    but they don&#39;t work with applications running in &#34;Classic.&#34; <BR> <BR>As
    for OpenType, Adobe carefully changed all the names for their OpenType format
    fonts relative to the Type 1 versions. So you couldn&#39;t just substitute without
    updating the file. <BR> <BR>Note that the client should be able to use Windows
    Type 1 fonts on just about any version of Windows. They may need to install ATM
    Light if they have something quite old, or perhaps they need the same patch mentioned
    earlier in this thread. <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Hector, <BR> <BR>ATM Deluxe is a font management utility. If you need a font
    management utility for 2000 or XP, you should consider ATM Deluxe and Suitcase.
    It&#39;s just the font rasterizer part of ATM Light that&#39;s redundant with
    the native support in 2000 and XP &#40;and OS X for that matter&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regards,
