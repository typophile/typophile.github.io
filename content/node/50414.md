    modified N)\r\n... KINGS OF LEON is eventually also a modification of Autoscape,
    but not sure..."

  body: "I agree ANTREPO is very reminiscent of Autoscape. I don't think \"Kings of
    Leon\" is based on it, though \u2013 there are too many differences (I, N are
    obvious; terminals of K, curve of S, \"roundness\" of G \u2026)"

    bionic system's Uberform - regular. you can see it if you buy their digital booklet
    and open in illustrator.\r\ni hope it's OK to bring this old thread up :D"

  body: "Hi John,\r\n\r\nthis came up a couple of times before, see especially <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/66953\">this thread</a>.\r\n\r\nIf <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Uberform.gif\">this
    image</a> (from <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/16552\">this thread</a>
    really shows \xDCberform (which I do not doubt), then there is more than one version
    out there: the <a href=\"http://archiv.digitalcraft.org/bionic/fonts.html\">\xDCberform
    on Bionic Systems\u2019 website</a> is different; maybe it\u2019s just an early
    preview.\r\n\r\nDo you have a link where this digital booklet can be purchased?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the info!"

  body: "digital booklet can be purchased at itunes, and when you open it in AI it
    says that \xFCberform - regular is missing (along some other fonts, but they are
    completely different).\r\n\r\nand about the two versions: i think that on that
    website is an older version (because the page starts with an www.archiv. and i
    suppose that it hasn't been updated for a long time), and that in picture is newer
    version. also, if you go to the original BS [[http://www.bionic-systems.com/]website]
    you can (barely) see in the headlines that the G, I and N are like in that picture
    preview someone posted.\r\n\r\ni wonder does the Bionic Systems sell their fonts?\r\n\r\nand
    if you want, i can send you a booklet, just send me a message :)"
