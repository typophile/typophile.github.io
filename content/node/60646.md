  trouble picking out the font for my secondary heading. Right now, font is Georgia
  and increased font size. Please take a look (I can't insert the image for some reason,
  keep getting errors, so I attached it.)\r\n\r\nAs you can see. It's annoying.\r\n\r\nYou
  probably know this but I remind you that there is a limited number of fonts available
  for websites. So please suggest cross platform fonts. \r\n\r\nAlso doesn't have
  to be just fonts, any recommendations about kerning, line spacing, word-spacing,
  letter-spacing, drop caps...?\r\n\r\nReally, any constructive critic is important
  to me. I hope to learn more from you all.\r\n\r\nSorry for the clumsy sentences.
  i'm tired. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Headers should always be appropriate for the content of the text.\r\nIf you
    don't want this header to be visible as the first thing in the text, you should
    try using the same typeface, size, kerning and line-spacing as in the main text
    + two blank verses (1 above and 1 below the headline). The white space created
    by blank verses will do just fine:) Using small caps is also a good choice, but
    it's difficult to make it in a webdesign...\r\nBut if it's really important for
    users of this page to notice this headline at once, making it a little bigger
    than the text (2-6pt) should be enough for w web page. You could also use some
    color (just keep it warm and it will be visible - red (but not #ff0000 :D) is
    perfect!\r\nHope I helped a bit:)\r\n- Filip \u0141ysyszyn"

  body: ">Headers should always be appropriate for the content of the text.\r\n\r\nI
    learn something new every day, or at least how better to explain it. ;) \r\n\r\nI
    think the <em>text</em> of the header should be appropriate to the content of
    the text it headlines, clearly. But the <em>style</em> of the headers is usually
    selected to be appropriate to the design of an entire document, first, and then,
    if a designer wants to change the header for every part of the text, say story
    by story, it may then be appropriate to choose that style based on the content
    of that text.\r\n\r\nOn the web, little of this is particularly possible along
    with kerning (none), line spacing(okay), word-spacing(none), letter-spacing (bad),
    drop caps (hassle).\r\n\r\nHave a nice day. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Thank you so much for your comments. And thanks dberlow, your explanation
    makes a lot of sense to me. I followed Lysyszyn's advice and added both space
    before and after to text and increase the text size. Below is the \"revised version.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2009-08-05_1046_4680.png]\r\n\r\nThere
    is still a bit of problem. I read that we should put more space on top of the
    heading than the bottom so it's closer to the text. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the heading
    still stands out too much. So I changed the color so it's the same with the body
    text, the heading is now not standing out enough. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2009-08-05_1049_3434.png]\r\n\r\nAny
    other suggestions? Or this is good enough (stupid question, but hey...)"
