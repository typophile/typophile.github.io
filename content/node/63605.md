body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI am generating a 'non style-linked' font family and for
  that reason I am not using the checkboxs 'Font is Italic', etc.\r\nFollowing advice
  given in this forum, I set a value in the 'Italic Angle' field (Font Info > Metric
  and Dimensions) because in that way styles are better listed in applications like
  InDesign.\r\nThe problem is that when I test the generated OT font in Font Validator,
  it seems to find an inconsistency in Italic styles:\r\n\r\n'The italicAngle is nonzero,
  but the head.macStyle italic bit is no set'. \r\nThe error is marked red in the
  report.\r\n\r\nIs it really something to fix or I should ignore it?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance. "

  body: On pointing out some errors, the Font Validator does a great job. On others
    ... it's safe to ignore it. If you search this forum you might find a few priors
    on this (and I am pretty sure this one has come up before).

  body: "In the AFDKO package there's a file named MSFontValidatorIssues.htm that
    lists some of the issues you might run into when testing OpenType-CFF fonts in
    MS Font Validator. And one of the things listed indeed sounds like the problem
    you're having. Here's the quote from that file:\r\n\r\n<cite>A font which is not
    an italic style of another face in the same family can nevertheless have large
    italic angle. Examples are script fonts and italic designs which are the only
    font in the family. In this case the Adobe Type Department prefers to enter the
    real italic angle in the post table italicAngle field. This way, the insertion
    bar is correctly slanted in most programs. However, this will cause the following
    messages:\r\n\r\n<code>E1316 The macStyle italic bit is clear, but the post table
    italic angle is nonzero</code>\r\n\r\n<code>E2308 The italicAngle is nonzero,
    but the head.macStyle italic bit is not set</code>\r\n</cite>"
