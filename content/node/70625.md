  body: Evidently, more letters are not available on the internet; perhaps someone
    has some vintage British specimen books...

  body: "Given the size of the type, it's unlikely a full alphabet would have been
    shown in a specimen book, or in a single document such as a poster.\r\nHowever,
    if someone were to attempt a revival, it would be possible from even these few
    letters, combined with a general knowledge of early sans letter forms.\r\nThe
    shapes are extremely gnarly, however, which is a bit offputting; one would have
    to make a lot of \"warts and all?\" judgement calls. The ultra-tight fit is quite
    interesting, though, and the funny torque of the \"N\"s."

    researching as reference?\r\n\r\nPersonally I find the \"gnarly\"-ness very appealing.."

  body: "\u201C#-line\u201D designations started out with a reference to exactly what
    size was being multiplied \u2014 e.g., Four Lines English, Two Lines Great Primer,
    etc.\r\n\r\nLater, I believe that conventions converged on Pica as the foremost
    basic measure; and 2-line, 7-line, etc., thus refer to multiples of Pica."

  body: so "1-line" was never a fixed unit of size?

    between counter and inter-letter spaces makes one want to disable tracking for
    some fonts. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
