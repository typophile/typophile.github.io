body: "The Typophile equivalent of shunning, which is much less obtrusive than starting
  a flame war.  Generally considered to be a more \"civilized\" way of dealing with
  people who post annoying or misleading content, stretch the truth to breaking, attempt
  to impose their system of politics or religion on others,  or just don't (in your
  opinion) have a clue.  \r\n\r\nA previous candidate was sativo: potential ones include
  Uli and missgiggles.\r\n\r\nAnyone is welcome to invoke The Silence Brigade, either
  personally without fanfare, or publicly, with appropriate notice.*\r\n\r\n* \"Appropriate
  notice\" is the use of this sentence: <em>I hereby officially invoke The Silence
  Brigade.</em>\r\n\r\n(T-shirts may be available at TypeCon: ask for <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/7716\">Ricardo
  Cordoba</a>.)"
