body: "Hi! This is my first posting on typophile and though my question isn't specifically
  typography realated, I do need educated opinions on a debate that I'm having with
  my (non-designer) boss.\r\n\r\nOur company has recently been rebranded and I am
  tasked with redesigning everything. First off business cards. Now rather than go
  the entirely traditional route (name, title, address, numbers, email, webpage etc)
  I wanted to ditch the name line, and just do email. Everyone's email in the company
  is first.last@ourcompany.com Similar to this:\r\n\r\nhttp://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u123/lynzee34/businesscardexample.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  have seen it done on just a handful of cards and I love it. I think it's sleek and
  very modern. My boss of course hates it, but I want to know what other trained eyes
  think. Am I pushing foward our medium or am I going against graphic design dogma?
  Should I keep fighting the good fight or am a wasting my time with a battle that
  shouldn't even be considered?"

  body: I did a card for myself that just had my email address as you've described
    above. I think it is fun and clever, but traditional suits might think it a little
    too much. I guess I can see both sides. Have you shown your boss what you are
    thinking?

  body: 'Why not provide everyone with two sets of cards, one with email only and
    one with the traditional info. If you''re clever you might be able to achieve
    this result by dropping one of the colors (passes through the press?) on the e-mail
    only card. '

  body: "It\u2019s a gorgeous design, but I do think that the retro design might work
    better if you kept it traditional and put a name line on the card. But a phone
    number is really a must on a business card (unless people at the company just
    don\u2019t have phones)\u2014if you leave the phone number off for the sake of
    the design, the design has broken the function of the piece, and thus it is a
    bad design."

  body: How big is the company? If it's large, then i wouldn't count on the email
    addresses. There's always more than one John Smith and Sara Jones that mess up
    the email system.

  body: "I'd agree with Mr. Aluminum. It looks great for a small designer or firm,
    but large companies have issues. We had a standard of first initial & last name
    at my last job. Worked fine until we had an asian last name of Ong, first name
    with a \"B\"... bong@thecomapny.com just didn't fit. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like an
    idea to use on a freelance job. Then your design-challenged, corporate-man boss
    has no say as to how creative you want to be."

  body: Business cards are something that people with a job can feel proud of. If
    my name isn't REALLY on it, it just adds to the feeling of being another number.
    Having your personal identity represented by an e-mail sounds insulting to the
    individual. Plus, what's your point? What are you trying to say? Is it a meaningful
    design decision? Are you trying to save ink? It's not a "good fight" if it's a
    pointless design whim.

  body: "<cite>Am I pushing foward our medium or am I going against graphic design
    dogma?</cite>\r\n\r\nRereading this, I really don't think it's a graphic design
    issue at all. That's not the way to think about it. It's really more of a branding
    issue - and the card's functionality. You can make it look great either way. I
    think you're wasting your time if you try to convince your boss on terms of design.
    And you run the risk of making him think designers don't know what they're talking
    about, which could come to bite you in the ass down the road."

  body: 'I think the concept is good. Nice simple clean design. But you kinda gotta
    think of the purpose of a business card & the market your targeting. It''s a contact
    card that represents a business as well as an individual. A phone number is still
    an essential element in contact information. Even though it seems highly unlikely
    there are still many people to this day who do not have a computer nor the internet.
    Another suggestion when presenting a concept to your boss you may want to present
    more than one idea because although your the designer they are the boss and it
    will always be that way! If he has design skills or not. He has a vision of what
    he wants. So try giving him more then one option to choose from. It always seemed
    to work for me with my boss. Hopefully I gave you some useful information! '

  body: "Thanks for all the imput guys-- but this isn't my card. I was just asking
    about combinding the name/email into one line and provided that card above as
    an example incase my description wasn't clear. \r\n\r\nMy card still has office,
    cell, and fax numbers as well as our address and website. Sorry for the confusion!\r\n\r\nMy
    original question was pertaining to if everyone thought the combination of name/email
    was an okay thing to do or if it was against graphic design dogma-- like trying
    to pass off Optimum as Optima. \r\n\r\nFurther info: We are a medium sized (1000+
    employee)document management/business process company who is rebranding themselves
    as \"Powered by technology. Perfected by people.\" We switched to Helvetica for
    our logo, a logo mark that is abstract people, and am trying to brand outselves
    as people serving people, customer oriented. So I thought with the combination
    of the name/email was a young, different, \"breaks from the traditional\", typographic
    way to relay our new image.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: I reiterate that I don't think it's a question of "graphic design dogma",
    and I'm not sure why you're going at it that way. It's a content/branding issue
    and waving the graphic design stick at your boss seems misdirected. If you want
    to convince him to keep it that simple, you should be talking about the image
    of the company, not graphic design. As a designer your job is to come up with
    an innovative solution either way.

    the other way you get an email address."
