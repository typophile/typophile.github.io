  body: "I find it depends on the overall size of serifs in the face.\r\nIf the face
    has smallish serifs, then the u's serifs, being one-sided, might need something
    extra, which a little bit above the x-height can provide."

  body: "Hrant, do you have studies of the u you're working with (assuming you're
    working with something)?\r\n\r\nI haven't yet developed a serif face so I have
    no method or even preference, but I imagine studies would help a lot. If you could
    share I am sure you'd find a lot of us willing to opine :->\r\n\r\nWould or should
    typical letter combinations that might appear have some bearing in this like Qu
    qu tu etc?\r\n\r\nI suspect that if the serifs were mere barbs a little curvuture
    would be useful as Nick suggests, but if they were slabby then going flat on the
    x-height would be the way to go.\r\n\r\nAnother question that is worth exploring
    in making a decision is just how much reference to chirography should be present
    in the face. I would think that the head serif would be approached by many as
    the entry point to the letter in handwriting and there would be a predisposition
    to have the serif angled.\r\n\r\nI am curious too if others have some ideas, choices
    or rules of thumb.\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: "A quick glance through Rookledge shows that Venetian (sloping e-bar), Angled
    Stress/Oblique Serifs, Vertical Stress/Oblique Serifs and (confusingly) Vertical
    Stress/Straight Serifs <em>generally</em> have angled serifs, while Abrupt Contrast/Straight
    Serifs (Didone etc) and Slab Serif have straight serifs. Of course there are exceptions
    and there are some that have different angles, different sizes/types (full and
    half) of serif and some have a chirographic lefthand serif. My general preference
    is angled followed by less angled (or flat) serif.\r\nI suppose it really depends
    on the type of serif and stress.\r\nTim"

  body: "The trick with the u is that the serif on the righthand stem is the only
    letter-internal x-height serif off a straight stem. If your design has strong
    triangular serifs at the x-height, you'll find that, if the basic serif model
    established by the lowercase i is applied to the righthand stem of the u it will
    dominate the interior space of the letter too much. I believe this is why the
    u often has more horizontal serifs than other letters: you adjust the righthand
    serif so that it leaves the counter nice and open, and then you have to adjust
    the lefthand serif to harmonise, otherwise the letter looks really weird. This
    graphic shows the adjustment in my SBL BibLit typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iu.gif]"

  body: "Another interesting note about the terminals of the lowercase u is that although
    the lower right terminal typically follows the more formal shape employed on the
    d, rather than the more cursive 'flick' often found on the lowercase a, the latter
    form is much better for attaching the ogonek in a convincing way.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uuog.gif]"

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nThose are some neat examples. Like I stated earlier, I have
    never drawn a serif face, so I've never studied that kind of subtle difference,
    and I'm sure it's not something that I would 'just notice either'. Very instructive.
    Thanks. The ogonek thing is so far off my radar at present that I just sat here
    going, \"Man oh man, that's pretty cool.\" It is a convincing comparison.\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: If you look carefully at the optical scaling of (real) Centaur, you'll see
    that the left head-serif has a much steeper angle in the smaller sizes than in
    the larger. What I don't know is whether there is some real reason for it, or
    whether it's somewhat arbitrary, perhaps because they were using different drawings
    at different times during the typeface's development. I haven't studied any other
    optical scaling families carefully enough to know whether this is a pattern in
    the same way as, say, opening the counter of 'a' and 'e'.
