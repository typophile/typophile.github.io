  version of a serif typeface at text size. I know slab serif (and later sans serif)
  were used for emphasis in body copy in the early 19th century, what I'm after is
  the first deliberately designed contrasting boldface, intended for use as we (or
  some of us) use boldface today.\r\n\r\nI've searched the archives without finding
  much of relevance. Can anyone shed some light on this matter? Or point to a thread
  I haven't found?"

    although I have a nagging feeling that I\u2019m forgetting something else that
    popped up earlier in the decade. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to if Bodoni had
    cut heavy weights of his designs at text sizes, but you would have to hit up a
    library with a copy of the Manuale Tipographico to confirm that."

    to do. I've found a horribly compressed [[http://www.rarebookroom.org/Control/bodtip/index.html|online
    facsimile]] of both volumes of <em>Manuale tipografico</em>, but so far I haven't
    found what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nNick, did you have a model for the bold weight
    of your Scotch Modern?"

    I wanted. \r\n\r\nI've now \"leafed\" through most of Manuale tipografico, and
    this is the best I could find: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni_bergamo_6488.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni_oxford_4560.png]\r\n\r\nThere's
    an obvious weight difference here, though I'd say the effect is rather subtle.
    I doubt these faces were meant to contrast one another, but rather had different
    uses."

  body: "Thank you, Philippe and Fran\xE7ois. I really appreciate your effort. The
    Bodoni specimen is highly interesting, that guy was a typographic visionary if
    there ever was one. But I maintain my idea that these typefaces were cut for different
    uses, and not intended for contrast on the same page. Which is exactly what the
    types in the Didot specimen do. I had a hunch that boldface is the daughter of
    small caps (or perhaps I've read it somewhere), and this seems to be an interesting
    transition between the two. "
