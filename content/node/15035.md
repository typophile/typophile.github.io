  already got a rough idea about what that is. I've looked at examples and looked
  on the internet, but alas I can not find the information that I want (all I find
  on the internet, is UNicase fonts to download) \r\n\r\nI know that it's a full set
  of 26 letters that has upper and lower case letters (whichever you want to pick)
  but what it looks like is that all the letters... weither they be upper or lower
  case, all take up the same space (same x-height?) anyways, can anyone help me with
  this problem?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor give my lack of Typography know how... I'm a newbie
  to all this, but I'm on the road to learning... and slowly developing a love for
  type.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    characters take up the same width (not related to x-height). Typically such fonts
    are used for setting computer programming code, if also to convey the programmatic.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I hope that's the case, because unicase fonts are generally\r\nquite useless (although
    Panoptica manages to avoid that fate).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "OK, re-reading your message more carefully, I think I did actually misunderstand,
    and you do in fact mean unicase - sorry. Besides Thompson, Licko and Shinn have
    made good unicase fonts (although those two have had cultural motivations, as
    opposed to Thompson's more functional one). And from a historical perspective
    you could look at Uncial.\r\n\r\nTry this too:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=unicase\r\n\r\nBut
    I'm curious why your teacher wants you to make a\r\nunicase font, especially as
    an early type design effort.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "The objecttive of the project is...\r\n\"To adapt a unicase typeface and
      create a new typeface design presented in a booklet format\"\r\n\r\nSo we have
      to take a existing font like (Bodoni, Times, Ect.) and turn it into a unicase
      making small alterations where we want. What I wanted to know is do I have to
      make the lower case letters that I use, the same height and width as the Caps?\r\n\r\n\r\nShe
      really didn't touch down on that, as I think we were supposed learn that for
      ourselves... and from the examples I've seen, the lower case look the samll
      height and width as the caps... I'm udderly confused, so if anyone can help..

  body: "If that is a direct quote from your professor, no wonder you are confused.
    \ ;)\r\n\r\nYou mention width.... Make the widths such that the shapes match;
    i.e. the letters will all have different widths, but when you combine them, none
    will look weirdly narrow or wide. Do not try to do what Nick Shinn has done and
    make them monospaced as well. One thing at a time. \r\n\r\nA more important thing
    to worry about is the weights of the strokes. If you started with UC letters and
    scaled them down to match the heights of the lowercase, you would have a few letters
    looking light and small. You'll have to beef up the serifs, stems, and hairlines
    of the scaled-down letters. \r\n\r\nYou might pick a font with small caps already
    supplied, so there will be less work matching the weights. There is likely to
    be some difference in height between lc and small caps, though. \r\n\r\nFor a
    very clear example of a unicase font, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/Volume.php?p=UPEMFILFM\">Filosofia</a>
    from Emigre. Licko has made a regular family of fonts and added a unicase one
    for fun. \r\n\r\nIt's your call whether the new alphabet is x-height or cap height.
    Just consider how it will look in use. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, Filosofia has a good unicase. \r\n\r\nYour post about unicase reminded
    me of a part in Simon Loxley's <a href=\"http://www.eyemagazine.com/review.php?id=119&rid=549\">Type:
    The Secret History of Letters</a>. So here's a little tangent that might help
    you decide which uppercase to drop in favor of lowercase or vice versa in your
    unicase design.\r\n\r\nLoxley talks about Bradbury Thompson's <a href=\"http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.htm\">Alphabet
    26</a>, his project to combine upper and lowercase letters into one consistent
    set of letters (in essence unicase). Thompson had felt that the variations between
    upper and lowercases of the same letter were too inconsistent and made it hard
    for children to learn to read. He eradicated most of the lowercases, except for
    a, e, m and n. "

    \"Peignot\" version of Bodoni, Times, etc.? \r\nAnd there are other strategies.
    You may even invent your own.\r\nThe choice of \"donor\" typeface might have something
    to do with how your design evolves.\r\nWhen I taught the unicase course, I was
    always thrilled by the wide variety of design solutions that students came up
    with for the same brief."

  body: "Indeed, \"strategy\", but to me that applies more to the functional realm
    - a unicase font doesn't have to have style as its only/main objective. In fact,
    Thompson and Cassandre (Peignot) were both after <cite>improvement</cite>, not
    fashion: the former like Dana said, the latter because he felt -not without reason-
    that the lc forms were \"bastardized\" and he wanted to return to the more dignified
    uppercase roots*. So one can make yet another pretty font, or one can try to \"serve\"
    users.\r\n\r\n* See my \"Improving the Tool\" for more on that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
