    a general landscape, even the mundane can present questions, why is it that guard
    is so often mispelt? who would be scared off by that picture of a Dalmatian?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk/london/tiles/ppark/ppark4.shtml\r\n\r\nJust
    in case your interest was piqued by the description of Postman's Park mentioned
    in Lore's link.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Actually when I first posted there was a map, I just didn't like it. Perhaps
    I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nI was trying to take a very blank approach and just walked
    the block shooting, then posted them in the order I found them. I understand the
    value of context so I will try to rethink an approach that isn't biased yet establishes
    the scenario a little better. It really is a rich neighborhood\u2026\r\n\r\nEventually
    I intend to do several blocks in the 'hood'.\r\n\r\nThe dalmation is by far my
    favorite photo\u2026\_:)\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: Wow! That really gives you some insight into your neighbourhood - what eye
    candy! Makes me want to see the buildings and street too - the people on the street
    - everything in context - maybe in a storyboard. Hey, this would be a really great
    student project -thanks for the idea Paul!

  body: "usually when talking about street signs, what worries me is not the style
    but the size. I\u2019ve been recently in a city near S\xE3o Paulo and I was shocked
    (and not particularly awed) at the way signage and publicity practically hide
    the front of buildings that could be historically interesting. Because cities
    are not planned to encourage people to walk rather than drive, the size of these
    signs is impressive as it needs to catch the eye of a person inside a car driving
    at a reasonable speed. I assume the lack of trees is a consequence since a tree
    would prevent drivers to read the sign. From this point of view, cities and towns
    in the state of Sao Paulo look pretty much the same, some are greener than others
    etc. but a part from that there is no way to differentiate one from the other.
    That's different in Europe where there are very strict laws regarding to this
    issue. In some cities in Italy (I don't know if this works everywhere in Italy)
    you are forced to choose from a very limited palette of colours when painting
    the external part of your house. A guy I know tried to escape the palette (he
    chose a really nice and discreet blue instead of the mustard/terracotta standard)
    and there was a big fuss about it, everyone was saying whoaaaa, take it easy,
    we are not in Mexico! On the same note I find it more relaxing walking on a street
    where the signs are not too invasive. "

  body: "The laissez faire nature of this signage reflects the neighborhood. It is
    very relaxed.\r\n\r\nThis area is an mix of a new yuppie population interacting
    with a Latino population that is firmly established. Gentrification has not conquered
    yet, unlike a lot of areas here.\r\n\r\nThoughts on Echo Park:\r\n\r\nWhen I first
    moved here I woke up to roosters and went to sleep with dogs. Now not so many
    roosters.\r\nI saw an Episcopalian nun and a Seventh Day Adventist lady in front
    of a bakery screaming at each other \"You're going to hell\".\r\nI saw a hawk
    circling Echo Park Lake and then diving to catch a fish while simultaeously looking
    at the downtown skyline.\r\nA man chasing a chicken, catching it, ringing its
    neck and carrying it into his \"butchery\" through a door with a horseshoe hung
    over it.\r\n\r\nOnce the 99\xA2 stores go, it will be time for me to move on\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"
