  body: The large type is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/barbedor/ef-black-italic/testdrive.html?s=Arte+Sa&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Barbedor Black</a> I think. Not sure about the smaller type. Looks
    a bit like El Greco or Cateneo, but not exactly like either.

  body: Mark, don&#39;t you think the small type is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/barbedor/ef-black-italic/testdrive.html?s=lazer+e+cultura&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Barbedor</a> too?

    target="_blank">Could be</a>, but some of the details don&#39;t seem to match.
    On the other hand, it may just be some kind of distortion in the reproduction.
