body: "Hello !\r\n\r\nI think fonts softwares offer a great opportunity to produce
  \"more\" than types for the client. The project below, Brouniak, is the third for
  which i used FontLab to create symbols the client can use in classical office softwares
  to get : vectorial logotype, vectorial backgrounds, vectorial pictograms, etc.\r\n\r\nFor
  Brouniak, i've created a special font, with the logotype instead of letters and
  dots instead of numbers : the client can use a vectorial logotype on documents he
  creates under OpenOffice, and the clock of his computer generate dotted random backgrounds
  (i've used the \"insert date/hours\" function to do that).\r\n\r\nYou can read (in
  french) the full project here : http://www.punkat.com\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br /><br
