body: "Is it just me or is it harder to get recognition and credit in life for designing
  a sans serif face than a serif face?\r\n\r\nAre serif faces just more beautiful
  and thus better received?\r\n\r\nThere are lots of revivals that get great plaudits
  (maybe rightly so because of the craft and graft that went into their creation -
  some may consider that it's just copying and not a whole lot else). But at the end
  of the piece, the typeface is very similar (albeit maybe better executed in some
  cases, with an occasional twist) to what has gone before.\r\n\r\nNow suppose a designer
  posts a sans serif face for critique that is similar to what's already out there,
  the level of interest wanes and criticism is intensified even though the differences
  are no more marked than those of a 'revival'.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is
  that and serif faces generally and revivalist faces in particular have it easy when
  it comes to critique and I'm not sure why...? Seems unfair. Anyone care to venture
  any thoughts on this injustice or have I completely imagined that it exists?\r\n"

  body: "Just a theory: more beginning type designers start out doing a sans face
    (myself among them), so that side of things is more crowded with amateur work?
    I wonder what the threads-per-year numbers are for the sans critique forum vs.
    the serif critique forum are.\r\n\r\nKaren Cheng: \"Initially, sans serif letters
    seem easier to construct than their serif counterparts. However, the novice type
    designer quickly learns that serifs actually provide a visual margin for error.
    Without decorative distraction, even small mistakes in proportion, color or balance
    become obvious. As always, elegant simplicity requires the greatest effort. When
    there are only a few elements, the quality of each element (and their precise
    placement in a composition) must be flawless.\""
