body: "Hi All,\r\nI just stumbled upon this brilliant magazine called The Fashion
  (Autumn/Winter 2000) from the UK. Sadly, it's gone under but I'm dying to know what
  serif they've used. The layouts are amazing. Here's an example I've scanned. Any
  help would be lovely!\r\n\r\n"

    so weird all italic caps."

    below I would think it isn''t that great. But, I''d be curious to see more. '

  body: It is pretty awkward, isn't it?  Rather unfortunate, given how well it looks
    otherwise....

  body: "Well, to me it looks like the typeface was never meant to be used like this
    (especially THIS typeface). That\u2019s probably why it was chosen. And that makes
    it an interesting design. Very UK."

  body: I think Caslon 540 it is...Here is another visual of the font. Thanks for
    your help! I just found another issue with another font I can't figure out. I
    will post that one shortly. I love the awkwardness of all caps. It's uncomfortable
    but in an edgy, good way.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion_6012.jpg]

  body: Now here is the other typeface. It seems they changed the main headline type
    with each issue...Does anyone recognize it?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mag003_6173.jpg]

  body: "Sushi, I think that's DTL Elzevir bold italic. See p. 49 of their PDF <a
    href=\"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/\">here</a>. I think I've seen that  wild
    ry ligature in the PDF, but I don't see it right now. \r\n\r\nIt is related to
    Caslon as many say that the types of Van Dijck, which are the basis of DTL Elzevir,
    served as models for William Caslon. \r\n\r\nBy the way, heinous use of Caslon
    540 :) "
