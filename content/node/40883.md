  body: "Fonts are software.\r\nBundling fonts with an operating system is quite similar
    to bundling a browser.\r\nIn both cases the dominant company provides an ancillary,
    lesser-valued product for free as an added value, because it facilitates the use
    of its major product. Meanwhile, there are small, independent companies whose
    sole business is the lesser-valued product, whose potential customers now don't
    need to buy that kind of product.\r\n"

    In this new case, the sum of the fine was 899 million Euros, i.e. more than one
    billion Dollars, i.e. more than $ 1,000,000,000.\r\n \r\n(For this sum, instead
    of buying Arial, Segoe and other ripoffs, you could buy a lot of original fonts,
    couldn't you?)\r\n\r\nOfficial link:\r\n\r\nhttp://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/318&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en"
