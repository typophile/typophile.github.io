  body: "Hi Diogo,\r\n\r\nI would guess that is not a font, as such, but is a logotype
    created specifically for the brand. Although having stated that, it does look
    as if it could have started life as Futura Medium Condensed and has subsequently
    been hacked around, especially the cap \"S\" which has a rather Art Deco styling.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nIf not you could always contact the manufacturer of the product
    for assistance! They have an even better example of the logo, which you could
    download and redraw, here:\r\n\r\nhttp://sylkusa.com/have-a-sexy-holiday-with-sylk-natural-personal-lubricant/\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nDoghouse"

  body: "Can't find a match either and totally agree with Bryan. Looks custom (and
    not a good one if you want, or not actually, my opinion). \r\nNow, it depends
    on what you need exactly:\r\n- a perfect ID to recreate a clean version of this
    logo and work with it: as I can't find it anywhere as vector (not even a PDF to
    extract it), your best chance is probably to re-trace it from the best source
    you could find ([[http://sylk.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Sylk-logo.png|best
    one]] I could get), would not be very hard... \r\n- because you'd like to know
    and get inspiration from: I'm afraid there's no perfect ID for this one; here
    are some alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/alpha-charlie|Alpha
