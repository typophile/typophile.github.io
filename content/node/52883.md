  body: "I'm curious why [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html|\"a typeface
    inspired by Italian art deco poster lettering of the thirties\"]] would be considered
    appropriate for a \"<em>contemporary</em> Italian food brand\"? Although the font
    was designed (or at least made available) in 2001, I don't see anything particularly
    contemporary about it.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: It could work quite well for a new brand because even though its roots are
    in the '30s it feels clean and modern to most eyes, especially the One style,
    and yet still has that Italian provenance and flavor.

  body: "LOL :=)\r\n\r\nRick, could you explain \"contemporary\"?\r\nIt's not essential
    for a suitable typeface for this to be \"Italian\", it's the overall design treatment
    which defines the mood.\r\n\r\nBesides, there's nothing specifically \"Italian\"
    in Aviano or Estilo. And Mostra is conveying more of a generic European atmosphere,
    with the added \"coldness\" of a \"digital-generation\" design (that's what I
    guess Stephen saw as \"contemporary\"). Giacomo is beautiful but looks more British-flavored
    than \"Italian\"."

    part of an <em>\u201Coverall design treatment\u201D</em>. Naturally it is a subjective
    suggestion.\r\n\r\nTim"
