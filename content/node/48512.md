  is the image we get to see from Arno Pro. However, when i look at the word eagle,
  it doesnt match any of the characters of the typeface. Anyone knows where to find
  these glyphs?\r\nSeems weird to me...\r\n"

      Swash face that you posted. Is it hiding somewhere in PS or AI, or do I have
      to purchase it separately?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: You can access the swash variants via the OpenType options in apps like InDesign
    or Illustrator. And via the Glyph palette, of course.
