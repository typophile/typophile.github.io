  for a school project (visual communication). I am interested in fonts/logotypes
  that are made from modular forms or based on grids. I know about the constructivist
  types of bauhaus or destijl. \r\nI have a vague idea of creating something like
  a toolkit for constructivist typedesigning or something like that. Providing different
  grids and shapes in an analog and digital way... (something like that: http://staff.lib.muohio.edu/~shocker/FemInv/patgifs/257630/01.jpg).
  Or creating instructions how to find your forms for such a type.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody
  have any inputs, ideas, links, font examples? \r\nI am greatful for anything.\r\n"

    is the font, Picgrid is just the grid, and the rest are variations."

  body: "Michael, this <a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.01.exercise1.htm\">link
    may be of interest.</a>\r\n\r\nWith regards to your idea of creating a \"toolkit\"
    for constructivist type design, I think it's important to be clear about what
    your aim is. Do you set out to exercise the creativity of type designers within
    extreme limitations? Or do you want to create a \"toolkit\" to introduce type
    design to newcomers as Briem has done in the site I linked above? \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    there needs to be a balance between limitation and freedom, if you place extreme
    limits in the \"toolkit\", the resulting designs could be bland. \r\n\r\nThat
    said, I'm only a graphic designer with an unhealthy type obsession and I'm very
    interested in what type designers have to say.\r\n\r\nGood luck! "

  body: How about the entire Transitional category of type. Geometrically constructed
    on a grid, with precision and accuracy, could that not be what you are looking
    for? Pixel fonts might also be something too look at as a more recent development.
    Although, it seems you are referencing the Bauhaus, so try and dig up stuff on
    Renner, Frutiger, and the like.
