body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI wrote this Robofab macro to copy kerning from one pair to others.\r\n\r\nI
  am using Class kerning put I kern OAO and then use the macro to copy those values
  to AC, AG, AQ etc.\r\n\r\nIt speeds the process up and ensures I don't miss pairs\r\n\r\n#Upper/UpperKern---------------\r\n#\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\nkerning = f.kerning\r\n#\r\nif
  kerning[('A','O')]:\r\n\tAO = kerning[('A','O')]\r\n\tkerning[('A','C')] = kerning[('A','G')]
  = kerning[('A','Q')] = kerning[('A','OE')] = AO\r\n\r\nif kerning[('O','A')]:\r\n\tOA
  = kerning[('O','A')]\r\n\tkerning[('D','A')] = kerning[('Q','A')] = OA\r\n\r\n\u2026
  \u2026\r\n\r\nProblem with this macro is it doesn't work with MM fonts. The value
  from one master is copied to the other.\r\n\r\nThe value for 'AO' could be different
  across masters but the macro copies the same value to both masters.\r\n\r\nThe Fontlab
  API KerningPair class says it's MM compatible but doesn't give any examples of how
  to use it.\r\n\r\nhttp://e-font.de/flpydoc/\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how I could
  use FL's API to copy the value of kerning pairs to other pairs.\r\n"

    not sure if Robofab handles MultipleMaster VFBs.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would
    be to simply put C, G, Q, \u0152 etc. in the right side kerning class for O ;)"

  body: "Robofab doesn't handle kerning in MM fonts, I think Fontlab API does.\r\n\r\nMy
    macro was done using Robofab but I would like to do the same thing with FL API.\r\n\r\nI
    could do the class thing but it wouldn't fit in with my work flow."

  body: "Here's an example of creating an MM kerning pair using the FontLab Python
    API: \r\n\r\n<pre>f = fl.font\t# Set current font to \"f\"\r\ng1name = \"A\"\t#
    First glyph's name is \"A\"\r\ng2name = \"W\"\t# Second glyph's name is \"W\"\r\ng1i
    = f.FindGlyph(g1name)\t# Find glyph index for \"A\" glyph\r\ng2i = f.FindGlyph(g2name)\t#
    Find glyph index for \"W\" glyph\r\nif g1i > -1 and g2i > -1:\t# If both glyphs
    exist\r\n  g1 = f.glyphs[g1i]\t\t# Assign first glyph object\r\n  kp = KerningPair(g2i)\t\t#
    Blank kerning pair referring to \"W\"\r\n  if g1.layers_number == 4: \t# Check
    if first glyph has 4 masters\r\n    kp.values = [-35, -32, -30, -28]\t# Assign
    values for 4 masters\r\n    g1.kerning.append(kp)\t# Add kerning pair to fist
    glyph</pre>\r\n\r\n(It's possible to write this code more efficiently, but this
    is the \"safest\" and most verbatim method that should show how it works.)"
