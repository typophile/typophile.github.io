body: 'Hi, I''m new here. I really love the look and feel of the place but I just
  think one thing is missing: the webicon. It''s not super difficult to code one in
  and for me it would make this site feel a bit more complete, especially with the
  way the page titles don''t start with Typophile- or something. Thoughts?'

  body: Maybe it's not my browser but this horrible VAIO laptop that cannot read .ico
    files for god knows what reason. I didn't see it in the code at a glance so I
    figured it wasn't existant. Oh well.

  body: Your laptop can't be blamed, favicons are a browser job. Neither I see it
    (Firefox and Safari on Mac OS X). Since it doesn't show up in the source code,
    it is possible that other typophiles see it only because it's in their browser's
    cache.

    plainly on the rss feed page.

    actually can permalink to comments, too. But you have to look into the source
