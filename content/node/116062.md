  is Chivo Black via Font Squirrel), only, well, more professionally designed.\r\n\r\nIt's
  for use as a business magazine logo, and possibly within the magazine.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions welcome!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cbc42562de982b91847cdf42d93e0c1a_5829.png]\r\n\r\n\u2014Chris."

  body: Chivo is from www.omnibus-type.com and upon examination is both well designed
    and technically quite well realized. Just because it is free and open source does
    not mean it is somehow less professional even though some posters here make that
    point from time to time. That said if you like the design use it - if you want
    something similar look at Gill Sans, Franklin Gothic, Avenir or Myriad.

  body: knockout might also be a very good alternative

  body: "Thanks Bob.\r\n\r\nYes, it\u2019s not terrible at all, I do quite like it\u2026\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    just a bit quirky for my needs, and some things seem a touch \u201Coff\u201D.
    For example, the \u201CS\u201D characters seem a little skewed. By professional,
    in this sense, I mean more conventional \u2026 less personality.  Must have more
    power than the comparatively cuddly fonts you list.\r\n\r\nBTW, I know my typefaces
    quite well \u2014 or at least I used to: not so much the massive wealth of new,
    lesser-known fonts out there.\r\n"
