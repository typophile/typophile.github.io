  body: could it be Adobe Sans filling in for a missing font? I can't remember what
    it looks like -- but this one is sure odd.

  body: Adobe Sans looks like a bizarre mix between News Gothic and Myriad. This certainly
    isn't it.

  body: Whatever the typeface may be, it's really very ugly. It looks like someone
    took Arial Black and made it even uglier.

    as it really is fugly.

      My ATM also says its using Adobe Sans as a\r\nsubstitute for missing fonts but
      it doesn't let me check the\r\ncharacter set. So maybe this isn't a regular
      font at all?\r\n\r\nCharmingly awkward is what I'd call it too, I also dig that\r\nLining
      Gothic 545. If you people can recommend any other\r\nawkward grotesque typefaces,
      keep them coming!\r\n\r\nThanks everyone.\r\n"
