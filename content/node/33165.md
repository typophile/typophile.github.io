  \r\nI am a pastor who needs to get information to my congregation all the time in
  the form of fliers, & brochures, (Church clean-up, spaghetti dinner, etc.) It would
  be great if we could hire graphic designers to do the work, and someday we may be
  able to do that. For now, I need to find a way to do the fliers myself. I have a
  good sense of what looks good and I know what I DON'T want (by this I mean that
  I don't want to reproduce cheesy looking MS word brochures with tacky clip art and
  horribly counterintuitive formats.)Still, I'm not a professional, and so what I'm
  doing is pretty basic and hobbling. So the question... \r\n\r\nWhat program do you
  think might help me to do my non-fancy publicity for my church members in a way
  that still looks decent? Suggestions? I am particularly interested in programs that
  might have some basic templates included or for purchase. \r\n\r\nThanks so much
  in advance. \r\n\r\n"

      are right that word need not be cheesy, but their templates are (generally)
      cheesy and un-friendly, so thanks for the pages recommendation. any others?

    use Adobe InDesign on a regular basis. I've played with Pages A LOT, though, and
    have a very good idea of what it is capable of. The interface alone shows a lot
    in this regard. It's well thought-out and very clear. Not a lot of extraneous
    junk that most users will not use. And, I can say that it does fairly decent typesetting,
    especially compared to Word.\r\n\r\nclauses:\r\n\r\nThat Scribus app looks intriguing!\r\n\r\nChris"

    what you put in. Perhaps Apple should include the boilerplate, \"Your Results
    May Vary.\"\r\nA good designer can make something good looking with any program
    and a bad designer can screw up any program's abilities.\r\nIt is not that you
    can't do something decent in Word. It is that the agony involved is not worth
    it. I can dance while hanging from my thumbs but why would I choose to? Pages
    is cheap and more sensible for page layout. Word is a bloated word processor that
    should stay a word-processor.\r\nI had a client a few years ago who asked me for
    a bid on a brochure. After I gave him the price, he said, \"Can I get it as a
    Word file?\" I told him that would triple the price. \r\nI have been using Word
    since it came out on the Mac in 1986. Back then WordPerfect was THE PC word-processor.
    It was a great and small app then. It was darn good through version 5.5. Then
    it got Cancer and all its cells mutated and grew huge tumors.  MS tried chemo
    which made a funny little paperclip guy jump up and get in the way and made you
    want to play whack-a-mole.\r\n\r\nIt is not that you can't do visually complex
    stuff with it Si, it just should come with the Surgeon Generals warning.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    for articulating what I've been trying to say. \r\n\r\nWord is a word processor,
    and not a great one at that -- far too bloated. True, I've made some fairly nice
    looking pages in Word, but the process was absolute agony and time-consuming beyond
    belief. \r\n\r\nPages is a good page layout application that beats anything else
    I've personally seen for beginners/intermediate use. Apple is VERY good at thinking

  body: "Thanks Chris, \r\n\r\nI'm certainly aware of the issues with Word (I probably
    hear about more obscure international font issues in a week than most users would
    experience in a lifetime), although I think the UI took a major step forward with
    2007. I just have a natural suspicion when someone claims that a product will
    be like having an army of graphic designers working around the clock.  \r\n\r\nI
    think \"results may vary\" comment is a good one - like the get rich quick schemes
    and diet pill ads perhaps a \"results not typical\" or \"profesional graphic designer
    portrayal\" would be good too. ;-)\r\n"

      Mac. It's not the best for layout (that's certainly not its intended use, after
      all), but it can do the job. It's really not so bad, except for some weird quirks
      in aligning things. Reposition a table or text box and watch your whole document
      reflow in unexpected and inexplicable ways."
