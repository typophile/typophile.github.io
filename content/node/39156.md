  or around the UK? Or anyone have experience with courses in it globally? (short
  courses i mean, and for people who are already designers)\r\nIm a graphic/web designer
  based in london (I love typography/typesetting) and have a serious itch to have
  a go at the traditional art of manual typesetting, wood type poster design etc\r\nI
  dont know how people get into this these days as i imagine there arent any options
  around but having learnt all i know about design after the start of the digital
  age i feel like Ive totally missed out!! Not to mention i know it will inform my
  future work on the compooder..."

    I also suggest getting a can of nice sticky, smelly ink, and a jar of kerosene.
    Place them open beside your computer for a few days. If you don't mind that, then
    sign up!\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    briarpress.org?</a>\r\nIt's an online community/resource for letterpress printers
    and enthusiasts- definitely check it out. They have classified ads, forums, tons
    of info about the history of letterpress, etc. \r\n\r\nI started printing about
    a year ago in NYC at a place called <a href=\"http://www.centerforbookarts.org/newsite/\">The
    Center for Book Arts</a> and I am hooked. It is the antidote to hours of staring
    at a computer screen. I'd be amazed if there wasn't a similar Center in London...
    Good luck!"

  body: "London College of Communication offers letterpress, but I only know this
    from watching a youtube video of how this one teacher forced all of his first
    year students into the letterpress shop before they even learned any software.
    I remember getting a catalog of theirs in the mail, but I really don't know how
    things work in terms of people who aren't matriculated. The site doesn't seem
    to be working for me right now for unknown reasons, but I'm almost certain they
    had 4 different options of enrollment; undergraduate, post, professional and pre-college
    on weekends. Hopefully that is a possibility for you so you don't have to spend
    all that money for what may be just a two day workshop [most of the ones I've
    heard of are very brief]. \r\n\r\nI've personally taken a 10 week letterpress
    class via continuing education courses at SVA in NYC. There is also Intima Press
    workshops in a wee little studio, also in NYC- http://studiosq.tripod.com/ those
    are usually 2-3 day workshops.\r\n\r\n"
