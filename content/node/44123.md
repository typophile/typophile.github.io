  face this is? Bureau Agency-esque but not the same. Sorry for the low quality but
  I couldn't find it any larger.\r\n\r\nFrom a Mucca designed website at www.domainedecanton.com.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!"

  body: Mucca does a lot of their own type, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is
    unavailable on the retail market. It has some similarities to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/red_rooster/grand_canyon/?sample_text=INDOCHINE&sample_size=144">Grand
    Canyon</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/constructa/?sample_text=INDOCHINE&sample_size=96">Constructa</a>
