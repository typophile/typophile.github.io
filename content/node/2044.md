body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been having a problem with my ascenders and descenders
  brushing up against each other when lines of type are set in my new typeface. I&#39;m
  using FontLab, and from what I can tell from reading the manual, my problem lies
  in adjusting the line gap. When I do this, regardless of the amount I put in, the
  baseline never changes. I&#39;m completely stuck. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Pretty
  please?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/20331.gif" alt="Screen

  body: You have &#34;calculate values automatically&#34; option selected. As I remember,
    it means that all data you entered into the first table is ignored and all values
    are auto-calculated on export. <BR> <BR>Btw, what font format you want to generate?
    <BR> <BR>Best regards, <BR>Yuri

  body: I&#39;m not sure, but I guess you might need to scale  <BR>down your characters,
    Corey. <BR>The second windows shows &#39;Ascender&#39; = 930 and  <BR>&#39;Descender&#39;
    = -280. Which means, IIRC, total height  <BR>= 1210. It&#39;s bigger than your
    &#39;Font UPMs&#39;, set to  <BR>1000. <BR>

  body: Yuri - when I change the line gap manually, it changes the default from automatic
    to manual. I screen grabbed it in the wrong state, but thanks. <BR> <BR>Eduardo
    - such a simple thing is always the fault isn&#39;t it.  Thank you very much,
    I will recalculate the UPM and go from there. Thanks!
