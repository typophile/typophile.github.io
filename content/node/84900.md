  I got this email today:\r\n\r\n\" FOX Sports would be interested in using your font
  in broadcast television and perhaps print media (advertisements only).  What are
  your licensing terms?\r\n\r\n \r\nThis is legit. I have NO IDEA what to charge!
  It's going to be used on TV. What should I do? Please help! \r\n\r\n"

    and the size and duration of the use. Then give them an offer on that.'

  body: "Spend a couple of days doing online research.\r\nLook at a number of different
    foundries that explain font licensing and get to know the categories of licence,
    and try and figure out why different uses are charged differently.\r\nYou won't
    get much information about pricing, however.\r\n\r\nYou should rename your font,
    Chalkboard is already taken."
