body: Does anyone know whether TypeCon 2005 in New York is actually happening? I was
  hoping to beat the deadline before the registration fee increases June 1, but it's
  possible to register anywhere. They have an ad in Print Magazine that lists www.typecon.org,
  but that domain isn't active.

  body: "Hey hey, TypeCon2005 is totally happening!!! Technical difficulties and volunteer
    time constraints are delaying the registration launch, but we are almost there.
    There will be at least 2 weeks of early bird registration, no matter when we launch.\r\n\r\nDavid,
    my copy of our Print mag ad lists our normal URL, typecon.com. Can you doublecheck
    your copy? It should not say typecon.org.\r\n\r\nWe only recently acquired the
    typecon.com domain. Prior to that, we had to use typecon2003.com, typecon2004.com,
    etc. Now we are able to simplify with one URL for the conference, typecon.com.
    typecon.net and typecon.org are simply aliases that point to typecon.com.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if you experience any other weirdness with domains... and remember, http://www.typecon.com
    is the place with the most current info."
