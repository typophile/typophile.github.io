  she can see how headings look in it. \r\n\r\nTo me the teardrop shape of the counter
  in the a, the bulbous nose on the uppercase E, and the sawed-off bar on the t, and
  the tapered appearance of some of the stems are revealing. But then the vertically
  squashed appearance of the lower case s and o are offputting.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stages-sights-sounds_4879.gif]"
