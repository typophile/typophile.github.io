  body: "Agree on that, I am also very interested in knowing how the general market
    looks\u201A if, and how many fonts different foundries actually sell. We all know
    there is ignorance among certain people and companies, not actually paying for
    fonts. Are there any actions taken to those? Do the foundries follow up and check
    these kind of things?\r\n\r\nAnother question I have is: What do the foundries
    do about these piracy-websites that distribute copies of great fonts and give
    them away for free as truetype-downloads?\r\nI can easily via Google find copies
    of many fine typefaces."

  body: "Royalties range from around 15% to 65%. The rate is negotiated between the
    designer and the distributor and depends on a lot of factors, mainly how much
    or how little effort the distributor puts into promotion. Exclusivity is another
    big determining factor as well as whether the designer did all the development
    work themselves or collaborated on development with the distributor. Of course,
    if a designer sells directly, he or she gets the whole amount, minus transaction
    costs, promotion, and support.\r\n\r\nGiven this, I have set up a little scenario.
    Let's say you are a type designer with fonts being sold at three different distributors
    at royalty rates of 15%, 50%, and 65%. Let's say you would like to earn $30,000
    per year from font sales. Let's also assume you only sell single fonts at a retail
    price of $30 each. Here is how it looks:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scenario_4304.gif]\r\n\r\n(The
    bottom row represents an average of the other three rows.)\r\n\r\nThis is of course
    over simplified. Most designers also sell fonts in sets at a discounted price
    and multi-user licenses at a discounted price. This means less income per font
    or per user, so you have to sell more to make up the difference. In practice,
    though, discounts like this tend to increase sales. \r\n\r\nAnother factor is
    the retail price. A high price will bring in more money per font, but may result
    in lower sales. A lower price may increase sales but bring in less money. It's
    not easy to determine the best price for a font.\r\n\r\nOf course, this simple
    scenario does not include things like development, support, or marketing costs.
    And lastly, you have to have fonts that people want to buy. This may seem obvious,
    but is easier said than done. "

    fonts in the library.\r\n\r\nIf you order the fonts in the Adobe Type Library
    by sales rank, and then do a bar graph of the units or dollars sold, it looks
    like a parabolic curve. It's really striking, and surprised me when I first saw
    the figures. It's like (speaking off the cuff here, without looking at figures)
    even the twentieth ranked font probably sells 50x as much as the median ranked
    font.\r\n\r\nI assume it's similar for any type foundry with a large number of
    fonts, but I'd be curious to hear confirmation of that theory....\r\n\r\nT"
