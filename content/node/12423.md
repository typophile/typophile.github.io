    talking about? 'Cuz that's no retro script...

  body: I think we still need an image (.gif or .jpg) showing the type you want us
    to identify. The only  online image I found for Filter magazine showed a blockish
    techno typeface, not a script.

  body: 'I think perhaps you mean <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/poetica/>Poetica</a>
    from Adobe. It''s often used by Filter Magazine, assuming you and I are referring
    to the same one. '

  body: A reply a year late, but for anyone doing searches... the font in question
    is Benguiat Charisma. Soon to be retired by Filter, because I'm doing a redesign
    of the mag.
