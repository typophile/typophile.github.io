body: Hello! I'm new here. I've been looking for this typeface for ages. I tried MyFont's
  What The Font several times with different images also I downloaded a PDF version
  of the magazine to get a clear and clean image and nothing happened. I thought it
  was Akkurat Monospace at first or Helevetica Monospace but the letter 't' has that
  particular curve up there and the 'r' is more wide and open. It would mean a lot
  if someone here could help me! Thank you so much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/9rhqol_3630.jpg]
