  src='http://www.tattoo-designs-of-all-kinds.com/images/tattoo-lettering-fonts-Old-English.gif'>\r\n\r\nNow
  I'm looking for exactly this font!\r\n\r\nI know there are a lot of similar fonts,
  some of the letters may be quiet likely\r\nin those fonts, but look at, for example
  the letters U, V, W or the H.\r\n\r\nThose are different to all the other Old English
  fonts i found.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is the original Old English font
  or what the name of the font is,\r\nbut I would be very happy to finaly get this
  font!\r\n\r\nDon't have to be a free font, be willing to pay for it if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
