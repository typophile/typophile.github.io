    body: "Thanks Don, that is a help. I was on Myfonts but none of my tags did any
      good. Tuscan is a new term for me.\r\nIn my mind it is also Victorian - because
      it is slightly ornate - but Victorian did no good in search results.\r\n\r\nThe
      best I can describe it is like western but more organic (not blocky)."

    referred as \u201Csplit serif\u201D).\r\nFor more ornamental takes on the genre,
    you can also look for \u201Ccircus\u201D."

  body: "Nicolette Gray, in her book on 19th century ornamented typefaces, surmises
    that these fishtail serifs originated with the Greeks and that their use became
    common in Rome during the third century. Some of the best interpretations of this
    style were accomplished by Italian illuminators and engravers during the sixteenth
    and seventeenth centuries. Tuscany is a region of Italy. \r\nDon"
