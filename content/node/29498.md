      a clue how to use them ... is there a guide or is it just 'common sense' ...

  body: I think this could be customised regular Avant Garde. The E is a bit different.

    be common sense. Just substitute ligatures for all the letter combinations there
    are provided for, take a good long look at it and then remove the ones that are
    too much. The only rule with these things is: \"If it looks good it <em>is</em>
    good\". ;^)"
