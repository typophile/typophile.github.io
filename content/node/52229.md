  between most letters keeps catching my eye. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fut3_4164.png]"

    kerning obviously.\r\n\r\nWhat does it look like with the real text? I think because
    it says Futura, I'm subconsciously paying more attention to the font. "

    their just texts that shouldn't be messed around with. their built to perfection.\r\nSo
    I say just leave it, well, just work on the kerning alittle more."

  body: "I would say it's the contrast of the black and white that's also is part
    of the problem... make background colour grey or another softer tint.\r\nThe 'tight'
    spaces will always create a visual problem, when the contrast is so high. I'd
    say the problem is a bit like this illustration... the eye will find it...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/232px-hermann-grid-illusion_3481.svg-tm.jpg]"
