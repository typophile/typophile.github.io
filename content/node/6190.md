    But no matter, it&#39;s beautiful.

    version? <BR> <BR>BTW, Stephen, you&#39;re forgetting Missionary. <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR> <BR>.unk stands for <i>unknown</i>, of course? <BR>It seems there&#39;s something

    the 1st UC &#34;G&#34; doesn&#39;t work, and the simpler UC &#34;I&#34; is better,

  body: I love it. But why in blackletter/uncial? It&#39;s pretty epigraphic, apart
    from the decorated caps. <BR>To download the flash file, just option-click and
    change the name to Ironweaver002.swf <BR>It has worked for me.

  body: Hey! You could poke someone&#39;s eye out with that! <BR> <BR>I see where
    the blackletter influences fit in. The undecorated letters remind me of Diotima,
    Koch Antiqua, and Nicholas Cochin.  <BR> <BR>The letters are very thin, though.
    Have you started bumping up against the limitations of em-square granularity?
    Speaking of which, also be careful of sharp, acute angles in your contours. They&#39;re
    usually not a problem, but can sometimes cause strange rendering artifacts on
    certain output devices. <BR> <BR>Some of the decorated caps can be confusing,
    <BR>since the stem widths are so close to the hairline strokes. I&#39;ll have
    to look at it some more before I can offer more useful advice. But you should
    definitely continue with it... you&#39;ve got something there.

  body: I&#39;m afraid this only exists right now as a great big Illustrator file,
    and I don&#39;t know much about actually making font files yet. Is there a limit
    to how small the details can be? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been thinking of making eveything
    thicker anyway.
