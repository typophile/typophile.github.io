body: I'm using Eames (House Industries) for body text, and Trade Gothic Bold Condensed
  (No. 20) for headers. What do you think is a good font for the main title? Something
  that plays well with these two. Thanks in advance.

    from the late 19c or even look at Franklin but older faces seem to lack refinement.
    Keep it simple and remember the scale changes the type entirely. You have all
    the Eames faces and tracking and kerning to play with too.\r\n\r\nJ"

    body: Thank you for your reply. Do you think something like [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainter/viewfonts|House
      Script or House Casual]] would work with them? Or perhaps something handwritten
      in the same vein as the House scripts?
