  <a href=\"http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/eecs.html?event_ID=21552\">scheduled</a>
  for Sept 3, on the UC Berkeley campus. If you're in the area and fascinated by the

  PhD is done, I'm hoping to have more time to actually draw fonts, but we'll see
  - there are a bunch of last minute things, as well as other important stuff I've
  pushed aside while I've been crunch mode on the thesis.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all
  of you for the encouragement and feedback over the years. It's amazing to finally
  feel done, but it hasn't quite sunk in yet.\r\n"

  body: "Sure, sorry. Here's the abstract, and of course I'm happy to answer questions.
    Chapter 10 is specifically about applications to fonts, so people here who would
    want to pick and choose might look for that one.\r\n\r\n\r\nA basic technique
    for designing curved shapes in the plane is <em>interpolating splines.</em> The
    designer inputs a sequence of control points, and the computer fits a smooth curve
    that goes through these points. The literature of interpolating splines is rich,
    much of it based on the mathematical idealization of a thin elastic strip constrained
    to pass through the points. Until now there is little consensus on which, if any,
    of these splines is ideal. This thesis explores the properties of an ideal interpolating
    spline. The most important property is <em>fairness,</em> a property often in
    tension with <em>locality,</em> meaning that perturbations to the input points
    do not affect sections of the curve at a distance. The idealized elastic strip
    has two serious problems. A sequence of co-circular input points results in a
    curve deviating from a circular arc. For some other inputs, no solution (with
    finite extent) exists at all.\r\n\r\nThe idealized elastic strip has two properties
    worth preserving. First, any ideal spline must be <em>extensional,</em> meaning
    that the insertion of a new point on the curve shouldn't change its shape. Second,
    curve segments between any two adjacent control points are drawn from a two-parameter
    family (and this property is closely related to good locality properties). A central
    result of this thesis is that any spline sharing these properties also has the
    property that all segments between two control points are cut from a single, fixed
    generating curve. Thus, the problem of choosing an ideal spline is reduced to
    that of choosing the ideal generating curve. The Euler spiral has excellent all-around
    properties, and, for some applications, a log-aesthetic curve may be even better.\r\n\r\nShapes
    in applications such as font outlines contain extra features such as corners and
    transitions between straight lines and smooth curves. Attaching additional constraints
    to control points expresses these features, and, carefully applied, give the designer
    a richer palette of curve types.\r\n\r\nThe splines presented in this thesis are
    entirely practical as well, especially for designing fonts. Sophisticated new
    numerical techniques compute the splines at interactive speeds, as well as convert
    to optimized cubic B\xE9zier representation."

    reading it.  The result about a 2-parameter family being defined by a single curve
    I think is particularly pleasing.\r\n"

    got the title page signed. There's a bit more bureaucracy before I actually get
    the degree issued, but I've met all the requirements, so it's feeling done.\r\n\r\nNow
    to rest and relax a bit :)"
