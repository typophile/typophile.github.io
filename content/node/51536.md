body: "When I use some imported fonts in Microsoft Word the capital letters seems
  to be cut off in the top. This is especially disturbing when using the Swedish letters
  \xC5, \xC4 and \xD6 (A, A and O with dots\u2026). Anyone familiar with this problem?"

  body: The vertical metrics/ascender values set in the font seem to be to small.
    I'd consider that a bug in the font and ask the foundry to correct it.

  body: "Could it be because the font size is relatively big compared to the line
    height? This is how Helvetica 18pt with line height 15pt looks (Word 2008 on a
    Mac, but I think it's the same on Windows). It's only a screen issue; it looks
    fine in print.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Malmoe-Skaane_5720.png]"

  body: "Jens is probably correct, and olander, yes increasing the line-height/leading
    will probably fix the problem without having to hack the font. In addition the
    diacritics will probably print fine.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
