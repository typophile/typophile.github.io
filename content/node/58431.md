  body: "I can see why they did, but [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/inflex-mt/|Monotype
    Inflex Bold]] may be slightly better, if you accept that some modifications were
    made. The R looks perfect except for the end of the tail, which I think may have
    been clipped off (and maybe straightened at the tip). The T has been widened,
    and perhaps a few other letters as well, but nothing I saw matched more characteristics
    than Inflex Bold.\r\n\r\nAt first I was looking at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/schneider-libretto-bq/|Schneider-Libretto]],
    which had a better match for the R tail, but the serifs are not bracketed.\r\n\r\n-
