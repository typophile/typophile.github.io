  body: Man, there are so many of these neo-geo-humanist sans out these days!  <BR>
    <BR>Locator from Process Type Foundry is not an exact match, but has a similar
    s and a passably close a. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html"

    target="_blank">Neo Sans</a> from yesterday. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s exact,
    the h is off for one.

  body: I agree with Marc, there are SO many fonts right now that look exactly like

  body: You said it, Patricia. If even half of the humanist/geometric sans in the
    Critique section make it to market we&#39;ll be in real trouble! <BR> <BR>But
    at least in this case, we do have a positive ID.
