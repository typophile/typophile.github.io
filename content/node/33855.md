body: I just spotted [[Farnham]] (Display, probably) used in headlines in a Finnish
  newspaper's travel special. To my shame this is actually first time I've seen it
  properly, and noticed, that the serifs are different in caps and lc. The caps ones
  are slanted and lc are straight, which is quite interesting. Is this typical for
  a certain style and are there other fonts like that?

  body: "Tiffany, I think Mili is talking about caps vs lower case in one font. \r\n\r\nThe
    caps do indeed have slanted serifs, and the lower case flat. Farnham was inspired
    partly by Fleishman. If you look at DTL Fleishman, the most faithful revival,
    it has flat serifs on both upper and lower case. Mercury, by Hoefler and Frere
    Jones  is also inspired partly by Fleishman, and there both upper and lower case
    have slightly angled serifs. \r\n\r\nSo this decision to have upper and lowers
    case different in Farnham is Christian Schwartz's innovation, it seems. \r\n\r\nEdit:
    I just checked the Jaspert Encyclopedia and the Enschede metal Fleishman there,
    which I think is the original, has flat serifs, like the DTL digital version. "

  body: "Mili, I did write a bit about this on my site, but looking at it again, I
    can see how there might still be some question:\r\n\r\n\"His [Fleischman's] serifs
    are an odd mix of wedge-shaped and rectangular, as dictated by where the characters
    needed additional weight. \"\r\n\r\nI certainly can't credit myself with any kind
    of innovation here. When I looked at some of the larger sizes of Fleishman's Roman,
    particularly No. 68, in an excellent little specimen that Enschede put out for
    one important anniversary or another in the early 20th century (sorry, I can't
    seem to find the specimen right now, or I'd give you the name), the cap serifs
    seemed to have some taper, and the lc serifs seemed to be flat. I may have been
    wrong, but it seemed to work in the early version of Farnham, so I kept it. Flattening
    out the serifs on the caps made them look weak and bland to me, especially with
    the tapered thins on E F M N etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FleischRom68_3615.gif]\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    <i>Sports Illustrated</i> didn't like the mix of serif forms, so they hired me
    to redraw the lc serifs with the wedge form for their 2005 redesign. I think it
    looks okay, but i think it's less interesting than the mix, which is probably
    a good thing - in SI, photography is the main focus."

  body: ">some of the larger sizes\r\n\r\nThis variation in serif shape may be partly
    a feature of Dutch type. \r\n\r\nI don't know original examples of Van Dijck's
    work, but in Caslon's, which was influenced by it, there is a variation with optical
    size. \r\n\r\nIn smaller sizes the serifs are a bit variable: sometimes straight,
    sometimes somewhat slanted. In the very large large size caps Caslon gave the
    caps bracketed serifs, and much higher contrast. These forms are the basis of
    Caslon 540 and Matthew Carter's Big Caslon. In both these revivals, the both the
    \ caps and lower case have bracketed, or curved serifs, as opposed to wedges.
    \r\n\r\nLooking at James Mosley's reprint of Caslon's 1766 specimen book, I only
    see one example of a lower case serif on the biggest sizes, but it it is straight,
    and unbracketed, like Christian's Fleishman sample, while the caps have bracketed,
    high contrast serifs.  \r\n\r\nIn all the sizes of Caslon, the vertical serifs
    on the CEFGST are wedges or softened wedges. "

    selection of types from six centuries in use at the office of Joh. Ensched\xE9

    page is in Latin. It's a little heavy on van Krimpen's work, considering they
    had six centuries worth of stuff to show - van Dijck just gets four pages, one
    of italic and three of fraktur, while Lutetia is shown in a large range of sizes
    - but it's a great little book and I don't think it's particularly rare or expensive.\r\n\r\nApologies

    somewhat shocked that the whole of book Dutch Type is on line at google.books
    [low res]. According to Mittendorp, only one italic physically survived, and that
    was the basis of the request to Jan van Krimpen to produce a roman for it, which
    became Roman\xE9e.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Van Dijck specimen sheets exist, and these
    evidently are the basis of the DTL revival by Gerard Daniels, called Elzevir.
    \r\n\r\nI can't tell much on the low-res image on Google Books, but it seems that
    the large size font, 'Ascendonica Roman' is like the Caslon Four Lines Pica in
    having bracketed serifs on caps and unbracketed on lower case--but not consistently.
    The DTL Elzevir has bracketed serifs on both upper and lower case. \r\n\r\nIt
    does seem that Christian is the first one to make this variation in serifs--which
    seems to hold for large sizes in 17th Century Dutch type--a general rule within
    a font family.   "
