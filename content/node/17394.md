  from Illustrator CS; as I have done for all the other font designs but when generate
  the font and go to type the percentage symbol, either nothing comes up or is replaced
  by the question mark symbol. It is visable in Fontlab 5 as an outline but not when
  you view it in a new metrics window.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help....I'm a little stuck?\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

    the percent name and Unicode index - 0025 - manually. I have seen similar problems
    with hyphen (sometimes), and a couple of random glyphs: Imacron and musicnaturalsign.'
