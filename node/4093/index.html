		<div class="commentbody">I knew I couldn't have too much hope of not seeing this already done. Though, from the smallish previews of Extra that I could find I do think that I've got some substancial differences. Like mainly I've stuck to the block more on certain characters (J, L, T, and especially I) which was something of a debate for me as the original concept was blocks with only the smallest of cuts to make them ledgible (and wasn't too worried about ledigbility at that), but obviously more traditional character widths/cuts could be good for those characters. But maybe now I'll just stick to the block for better or worse. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hrant, your :-(  I'm translating as</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm actually not sure which is better/worse, and I don't want to discourage you. As long as you know what else is out there, and you make your own thing (mostly) independently, and the process turns you on, that's plenty. Hopefully it will turn other people on too, and maybe you could sell it better than FF? (Although that would be hard.) Type history is littered with plagiarism but also coincidental similarities. For example there's a part in Alexander Lawson's incomprable &quot;Anatomy&hellip;&quot; where Zapf expresses surprise at the similarity of Optima to a much older design by Middleton - but compare how the two designs fared on the street. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although it is similar, and in some ways very similar, I also think it can be seen as very different. I prefer the rigidity in Mitchell's.
