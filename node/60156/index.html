Second question:
What do you all think about the method using a standard font and change ONE or TWO small attributes...

THX - and NO!
Why not?
a) there is not ONE -small- modification in any letter...
b) it looks like CAR or TRUCK... but not like the product portfolio of that company...
c) I'm missing the 'dynamic/progressive' cursive...

You're right with you oppinion about the tight spacing... and your comment about 'distracting bullets'... YEAH! I want it!
Cause after the FIRST look every eye can remember the bullets with the "E"...

Tomorrow I'll give u a new corresponding idea - depending on SPACING AND BULLETS

C) I don't see dynamic or progressive in your samples either. If that's the direction the brief has set out you may need to re-examine those two elements and start from the ground up again.


I see why you're trying to make a mark out of the type, but it's obviously forced and a bit contrived. As well, the second and sixth letters don't have any rational for being that mark. When I look at this company and it's aesthetic I get a hard angled utilitarian quality. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This totally looks like a logo for a Trucking company. I can just see it plastered in vinyl on the side of a big rig. I don't get dynamic or progressive from it – well maybe dynamic, but not in a good way. I would avoid Eurostile – and wait ... did you manually skew Eurostile Extended Black? Or did you manually stretch Eurostile Black Oblique. I'm sorry, I don’t mean to be an ass, but nothing about this logo is really working for me.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi folks...

a) I really thank you 4 yr help, yr thoughts, yr critics & yr ideas! No one of you should be sorry about critical statements in my direction... it's OK and I begged for...

b) my english isn't good enough for understanding everything at the FIRST point.
I am able to understand FACTS but I'm not able to understand emotional statements or cynical comments or phrases or sentences in metaphorical meaning.
Sorry, I'm from Austria ;)

@picard102
> A) Why do you need to modify at all?

To modify the font???
Cause I dislike the fact that any rooky secretary is able to rebuild the logo only by finding out that this is EUROSTYLE.

> B) Then just have one E in a circle. The versions you’ve produced evoke the same car/truck motif.

This idea could be the last solution...

> As well, the second and sixth letters don’t have any rational for being that mark

My intention is/was to benefit by the fact that the SECOND and the PENULTIMATE letters are the same. In my point of view this is a big advantage in contructing a logo out of company name... specially when the company builts up something with wheels...
===============================================

@Ed_Aranda
> I’d be happy to offer some constructive feedback if you let me know a bit more about who/what this logo is for.

It's a company in germany which produces machines for landscape maintenance - target group are communities...</div>

My best advice is to abandon the concept completely and start over. It looks like you're trying VERY HARD to force it to work, but it just doesn't look right, and I don't think it ever will. Stop focusing on the E circles and try something else. </div>

I'm sure there IS a solution... but obviously not my actual idea.
For me it seems to be easy to top THAT ACTUAL logo:

If you are not representing the "E-SPLINT," there is no reason to focus on the letter e. It holds no meaning. It makes no sense. It's not connected to the brand, the company, or the industry. It does not make the name more memorable, it just looks bad. 

I begging you! Stop thinking the two ees provide a solution. They do not. Focus on the whole name! The company's existing logo is much (much!!) better than anything you've done here.

		<div class="commentbody">Dude, start over. Wipe the slate completely clean and try something entirely different. Alaskan pretty much covered all the details, so I won’t restate.

Think about the types of things this company makes and try to envision what kind of logo would belong on those things. For instance, if they make lawnmowers, think about what kind of logo you might see on a lawnmower, then do something better! 

Some questions to ask yourself that might help you to better define what your logo should implicitly communicate:

If the lawnmower company was a person, what kind of conversation would you expect to have with him (assuming lawnmower is male)? What kind of language (tone) would he use when he speaks? What kind of clothes would he wear? What kind of music would he listen to? What kind of car would he drive? 

Avoid making random design choices. Treat each design choice as part of the solution to your problem. If your problem is that you ran out of milk, you wouldn’t spray your fridge with a fire extinguisher.

Hope some of this gets through. Good luck.</div>

NO!
That Logo will be made for the FISH, not for the FISHERMAN!!!
U understand?
It's not my/our job to satisfy or to enjoy the fisherman - and afterwards not one fish bites...
This is my experience in marketing!

@Alaskan
Yep!
The focus on E-SPLINT will solve two circumstances:
1) The owner of the company can identify his development in his name.
2) The customers know the symbol because of removing the scythe for grinding.

What do you think about that idea?:
(the only modification of a letter was a contraction of the middle bar of the "E" in order that it looks similar theyr splint)

I don't think you understand. No one is saying have the CEO design the logo for you. He's saying you need to do the basic ground work for any branding project by identifying the personality of the company. Without doing so your attempts will always come up short of the real goal. 


>The focus on E-SPLINT will solve two circumstances:

It doesn't solve any real issues at all. Firstly it is an E, not a graphical representation of the tool. The majority of people will see it as such. Secondly focusing on this half baked direction causes more problems then any it might solve. 


>What do you think about that idea?

You're going to get the same replies here over and over because you can't divorce yourself from this concept. 

It's horrible. It's been said time and time again and no amount of variations on E's is going to produce a different response. You're just spinning in circles. You need to separate your ego from the concept and move on to something else. 

You're not listening, and people will just give up on this thread if you can't get past that. </div>

You may not commit suicide after these comments, and that is good. But you might be frustrated by the responses.

That being said, take picard's advice and scratch this one (let this concept commit suicide).

I wasn’t even going to bother responding to this, but it’s bugging me. Like Picard said, I’m not telling you to let the client design the logo, I’m saying that it’s <strong>your</strong> job as the designer to communicate visually, however you see fit, the values and personality of the brand. Your ideas thus far communicate <strong>nothing</strong> at all. It honestly looks like you put a bunch of letters and shapes in a hat and chose at random.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">PREFACE
I think I've made a big big mistake in presenting a half-done logo!!!
OF COURSE there is a 'communicative addition' - but in my thoughts I knew that this fact will be added afterwards...

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_OK_4708.jpg]

NOW the logo communicates *imho*
- Name
- Technic (san serif)
- Dynamic (italic)
- Company Color (red)
- Wheels
- Symbol (E-Splint)

Everybody can see/read that the company deals in 'Machines On Wheels' - whatever they are and whatever they do.

@Ed_Aranda

> I wasn’t even going to bother responding to this, but it’s bugging me. Like Picard said, I’m not telling you to let the client design the logo, I’m saying that it’s your job as the designer to communicate visually, however you see fit, the values and personality of the brand. Your ideas thus far communicate nothing at all. It honestly looks like you put a bunch of letters and shapes in a hat and chose at random.

The client won't design, the client only decides...

About the company:
- OF COURSE they produce more than only lawnmowers... but everything they build has got wheels...
- All the leading people in company are engineers/technicians...
- It's a family enterprise with NO identification still yet...

Under that new aspects my logo of course communicates!

About the "E":
I've seen thousands of logos where a symbol was designed in a 'cramped' (artifical) way.
Designers (mostly rookies) did awful things in putting letters together for creating communication.

HERE it seems to be a 'present of heaven' ;) where the both "E" are positioned.
Furthermore the "E" and one of theyr self-developed parts (E-Splint) fit together in a perfect way... 
And if I won't use that facts everybody can insult me 'blind'!!!

I won't believe that this could become a question of a cultural circle/sphere.

(Besides - the markeing manager is a friend of mine. And I'm sure for 1000% that he will NOT take an inoperative logo for his company only because of our friendship..)

I will inform you - and I try to give you HIS response, too...

It's not. 
I'm in your "cultural circle" – assuming you mean that geographically –, and I don't think your logos work. I might not have been as utterly dismissive of all of the variations as others have been, but I think you've really lost anyone who was still willing to give you constructive feedback when it became obvious that you do not accept anyone's suggestions. 

You admit to not being a designer, you post your work up for critique (nota bene without giving any sort of substantial information about the project, the client, the brand). A great moment to be humble, and listen for a moment, and learn.
But instead of being willing to listen, and learn, and become more sensitive to the game that is design (or the place that is Typophile, for that matter), you just got loud and defensive, and now seem to try to teach everybody here that YES, your design WORKS!!!
Then you start insulting regulars on their own blogs.

Random movie quote of the day: "What we've got here is failure to communicate."

I hope you begin to realize that you won't get much constructive help here, which is one of the best things this place has to offer, and which this place does best. Your loss.

Over and out.</div>

THX for yr comment WITHOUT emotions!
I understand yr writing for 85% - but the meaning only for 50%...
What does it mean "Readability for one: the highlighting of random letters in a word rendering it off-balance." ???

The highlighted letters "E" have a MEANING... for the company!
Like this example:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beispiel1_4686.jpg]

Everybody who knows NASA or rockets or the Apollo mission is involved - and realizes the space capsule as "A"...

What is "off-balance" ??????????

=========================================================

@altaira
> ...that you do not accept anyone’s suggestions.

Critics started with: "the placement of the Es in the circle is currently breaking the flow of the word"
I amended it!

The next (positiv) thought was: "Unless these were meant to serve as a reference to wheels of some kind."
Yes, it is - a kind of wheels!
I communicated it...

The next was: "It’s about those gap between ER and EN."
Yeah, that's right...
I agreed - and amended it!

Then follows: "Now the E character look like O with three horizontal bars. :D But it’s better than the previous versions."
Next comment to think about...

Than Tiff wrote: "Initial thought: The spacing is too tight to have those bullets."
I amended it...

Tiff wrote again: "This makes it worse for two reasons. The S is now floating and those bullets are still distracting."
She was right - I could see the SAME problem...

Now Rat had a hint...
and so on
and so on

altaira, my problem is:
Everybody was united and said "No"... but they were NOT UNITED in their punctual critics...
THIS IS THE EVIDENCE that there of course is a personal view in amendments... and it is NOT POSSIBLE to concentrate on ONE special mistake.
You see.... everybody has got his own point of view and criticises different mistakes.

-------

altaira again:
> nota bene without giving any sort of substantial information about the project, the client, the brand...

MY mistake - but i catched up on...

-------

by altamira:
> But instead of being willing to listen, and learn, and become more sensitive to the game that is design (or the place that is Typophile, for that matter)...
I WAS willing...
I read and listened...
And I learned - cause IF not, I couldn't have made some different versions!
But the critics was only "No!"... the criticans hadn't been unique in their critical facts.

The difference is:
I declared step by step what I'm thinking... and the 'genious guys' declared me their feelings!

The reason why I started in this forum was a little bit of hope that the 'genious group' KNOWS what they are thinking and writing!
(Similar like a penalty in football... that is equal - all over the world and everybody knows how to evaluate and handle a penalty)

Do you understand MY problem in this forum?
I've got the feeling they don't criticise not the development of that logo but my person.

I think I know the main problem - it seems to be the gap of language.
I should try to find a similar platform in my mothers tounge...

(Wo kommst du her, altaira?)

Your NASA example is equally terrible. It reads NS Pollo = Non Smoking Chicken. It's clearly not a logo, either. 

Just because something has been done before does NOT mean it's good. Just because you can explain it doesn't mean it's good. In fact, there's a stronger argument that says that if you have to explain it, it's NOT WORKING.

I dunno. But the fact that he pulled out that NASA picture <em>to prove his point</em> sealed it for me -- he's never going to budge from his bad idea. He's like that impossible client who insists their six-year-old's pixelated, frosting-covered face belongs front-and-center on their website (and on their business cards!)
