<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
What do people use in OS 10.4 for typr management.
Is Suitcase still the leader in this area? I have been running the standard
fontbook that obviously come with 10.4 but I really don't feel comfortable with it.
I have used a Mac for a few years now and every problem that I have with them seems
to stem back to fonts?
Could anyone pass on some experienced words of wisdom on where to best store fonts
in OS 10.4 and the most effective management systems?
Thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>It was shown at TypeCon. It's an iTunes-style font manager that, from what I saw, works well and has a nice interface (again, it looks a lot like iTunes). It'll also allow you to do some EULA management and even browse and buy fonts (supposedly Linotype is opening this up to other foundries).
And it's free.</div>

A Linotype rep will be talking about it at the TechForum preceeding ATypI in Helsinki.
http://www.atypi.org/07_Helsinki/30_program/30_other_events/10_typetech
It looks exciting, but we have an NDA with Linotype so I can't go into detail on what I know.
Cheers, Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am also interested in this...I use FontBook but it seems to bog down all my applications during opening sequence (loading fonts...10%, 20% etc.) It'd be cool if I could have all my fonts loaded into an application but they're all disabled until the program says 'I need this font and this font' so they get enabled. Maybe I'm wishing for the impossible. It'd just save some strain on my system.</div>

From my exprience it doesn't do it on the Mac version either. Its a real pain in the arse. The minute an application does that seemlessly I will bow before it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>WIll the Linotype software handle auto-activation? Will it use a plug-in/XTension for InDesign and Quark XPress? If so, that's a pretty ambitious move into the software business. Software engineers don't come cheap.
One would assume that if the product will be free, it's main purpose is to *encourage* people to purchase Linotype's fonts.
It would seem that there is at least a little room there for conflicts of interest. For example, managing OpenType fonts is much easier since most OpenType fonts on the market have been recently released and are from major vendors. It could be that support for Postscript and Mac TrueType might be lacking in the hope of selling people new editions of typefaces they already own. There was some similar discussion around this topic concerning Adobe's Garamond Premier Pro. There are some nice features in those products, but it's really a tough sell for people who already have a licensed version of Garamond.
That said, Adobe used to sell both type and manager. But then, Adobe was also selling PageMaker and Illustrator.

I've been contemplating MasterJuggler for a while now, but all indications from Alsoft point to little or no development of this product.
I hope we finally get a font manager that actually works AND has a good UI.

<div class=commentbody>I've been quite happy with Suitcase 9.0 for PC; really my only complaint is that I'm lazy and get irritated turning on and off the hundreds of custom sets I've put together. (I swear I'll donate my left leg for auto-activation in Adobe Apps on PC!).
I installed the trial of Suitcase 9.2 but wasn't all the fond of it so went back to 9.0. It's worked very well for me but, as I said, I've been chomping at the bit for something that will auto-activate.</div>
