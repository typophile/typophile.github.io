    Honey</a>.\r\n\r\nWith every repeated letter being quite different in the first
    image, it might be from an Opentype font with alts - but I doubt it. Likely it's
    done by hand."

  body: "I agree with Mike F, that the first sample looks hand drawn. There must have
    been other digitizations of that script, because [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg4.html|Susie
    Q]] seems identical in form, and would be completely identical with a bit of added
    stroke. It's the sample labeled \"Suzie Q\" (erroneously).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The Filmotype version is from the 1950s. The digitization is recent (I did
    it), but as far as I know, the design originated with Filmotype and the one I
    did is the only authorized version. It's also the only one with all the contextual
    alternates included (and it uses them automatically). \r\n\r\nThat said, the sample
    given was probably made using one of the many knock-off versions of Honey, particularly
    since it utilizes none of the contextual alternates which are typically missing."

  body: "The thing that baffles me about Filmotype fonts is that different versions
    (bold, condensed, etc.) of the same typeface have completely different names.
    The fact that those names share the same initial doesn\u2019t help much, since
    there are also different typefaces with the same first letter in the name."

  body: "Well, that's how Filmotype named their fonts way back when. \r\n\r\nA few
    years ago, when the group of us* were planning on how to digitize the Filmotype
    library, we debated the question of this quirky naming scheme. In the end, we
    decided it was important to us to preserve the historical names as much as possible.
    They don't all fit neatly into type families anyway.\r\n\r\n* I'm a former member."

    could have been useful for new users (and for some type IDs too ;-)

  body: "Hi Mark, \r\n\r\nWhen I said 'older than the Filmotype version', I meant
    the new digitizations that are being released. Congrats to you, Patrick Griffin
    and others for reviving these old film types. \r\n\r\nThe Type Revivals version
    was done in the '90's, and not only they, but also Bitstream and URW had brought
    back some of these designs, before the recent re-creation of Filmotype. The midsection
    of the Solotype Catalog is filled with examples of these scripts, and it's nice
    to see them coming back to life.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "There is yet another, much poorer, version of the script font - probably
    a partial clone of either Susie Q or Filmotype Honey, but with major differences.
    This is \"Positive\" by Enstep/Imageline. They also had one, named Experttype,
    that's similar to the Honey Script Light Condensed  seen in the Solotype catalog.\r\n\r\n
