body: "Here goes, In a rather brief previous post i explained my situation. Im a 17
  year old student that probably makes me quite young to be on his site (or so i imagine),
  and as i said in other post i needed help on books to read to influence/help me
  !\r\nI got 1 reply and followed up on it, and from then i have had a strange sort
  of faith in this forum and community (brown nosing is over)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?32zuxrlz3h6\r\n\r\nIn
  the above link is a pdf file to my Final Piece, its meant to be an example of a
  magazine, based on the likes of GQ and G2 (that rather useless pullout in The Guardian.)
  It would mean alot to me if any of you could look over this and guide me/tell me
  how to do better and produce better works, and work more efficiently.\r\n\r\nAlso
  at this time i find it quite fitting to raise the issue of piracy, im not proud
  but the software i produced my work on was a pirate version of InDesign CS3. Apparently
  i can be disqualified from my exam for using a pirated version of software ?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help/answers would be greatly appreciated guys.Also at this point id like to point
  out the text in the 'cars' pages is lifted and edited. Im not claiming it to be
  my own. Thanks\r\n\r\n :)\r\n\r\nAlso, please remember im only 17. I'm no design
  pro"

  body: "The layout is nice, better than a lot of what I see from college students.
    That said, a little white space would be nice. I realize that these jam-packed
    layouts are common in men\u2019s magazines (even moreso in the UK!) but really,
    give the reader a spot to rest. \r\n\r\nBut your details are horrible. I have
    no idea what you\u2019re doing with the beginnings of paragraphs, because it changes
    for every paragraph.Punctuation is missing all over the place. You aren\u2019t
    aligning the baselines of your columns of type across the pages. There isn\u2019t
    enough space around the drop caps. You random shift between justified and ragged
    type. You have no drop cap or other indication that the section about the Mariner
    is a new section, breaking the form established on the previous page. You aren\u2019t
    using lining figures. You probably don\u2019t need to indicate the source of your
    text and images on the page unless your instructor is demanding it, and if you
    do, don\u2019t call it out, make it smaller and unobtrusive. On the cover, get
    that giant price out of the dot and tuck it somewhere less annoying. Move the
    bar code, too. And get all of the type away from the edges.\r\n\r\nYou really
    need to learn to self-edit. Print it out, sit down with a red pen and circle everything
    that\u2019s incorrect or inconsistent. Then fix it all and do it again and again
    until there\u2019s nothing to circle.\r\n\r\nAs for your software situation, either
    buy Indesign or keep quiet about it. You aren\u2019t doing yourself any favors
    by discussing it online."

  body: "The cover is a bit heavy on top. If you really want to put that much text
    on the cover, try photoshop the photo and put the text \"underneath\" the model(I
    assume you know how to do that?).\r\nOther than the beginnings of paragraphs,
    I'm also seeing a lot rivers. It doesn't look very attractive.\r\nJust my 2 cents.\r\nbtw,
    just say you used your school's indesign."

  body: "\"You aren\u2019t aligning the baselines of your columns of type across the
    pages.\" Problem one, watch that. \r\n\r\nTry more space around the photos. \r\n\r\nOn
    the cars, using the type on top (sparingly/partly) of the photos is used often
    in mens mags.\r\n\r\ntry some color. a red box with white type. Some red type
    on the cover. \r\n\r\nSome line elements would be nice. something heavier than
    the ONE you have.\r\n\r\nI like the contents page. You spent some time on that.\r\n\r\nline
    up the Hollywood with the type below it, or don't. but not in between. look at
    all the alignment on that page. but good use of hierarchy.\r\n\r\nalso most mens
    mags use MULTIPLE typefaces(like you did on the cover) try mixing it up a bit.
    Larger Point size and random serif to sans serif to grunge in your titles. \r\n\r\ntry
    something other than grey on the cover.\r\n\r\nsorry if that was too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No,nothing is too much. I like all the input i can get.\r\nHowever, i disagree
    with you saying to put red type on the front cover, it just stands out like a
    sore thumb and looks out of place. BEcause the cover girl is the first thing you
    see i dont think i could still keep the amount of text there and hide it behind
    her, as this just distorts the text and makes it illegible.\r\n\r\nI'll get some
    more space in around the pictures, and im editing and re-writing the articles
    now. Ill upload another copy when i've finished my modifications. Thanks also
    for bringing my baseline problem to my attention, i hit my head as i read it !\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: In addition to what was already said, your type needs room to breath. I notice
    that the spacing between elements is often cramped. In some cases there is more
    space between adjacent letters than between adjacent lines.
