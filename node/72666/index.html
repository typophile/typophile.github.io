  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">One of our typophiles, <a href="http://typophile.com/user/14662">Georg »Bleisetzer« Kraus</a>, has passed away <a href="http://www.blog.druckerey.de/index.php?id=396">on July 22nd 2010</a>. He was a man with character, who didn’t refuse to tell his own opinion, especially if it is against the mainstream. He was a <a href="http://www.bleisetzer.de/">keeper of lost typefaces</a>, a provider of vintage typespecimen; a fighter for the »black art«, for mankind, for his home country. He lost his last fight this July. I will always remember you, Georg. <em>Gott grüß die Kunst.</em>

Georg was a controversial character, always outspoken, often opinionated. I appreciated his authentic nature and his generous attitude. The <a href="http://www.bleisetzer.de/schriftensammlung.html">samples of his metal type collection</a> that he shared on his website have been a valuable resource to me. Georg, schöne ‘Betriebsferien’ – may you rest in peace.

Rainer, thank you for sharing this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am deeply saddened to learn of Georg's death on 22 July. I learned this sad news from a post by a member on The Briar Press. I had not met Georg in person, however we had been communicating often in the past few months as he was helping me equip my letterpress workshop. We spoke less than a week before the operation. Georg was reflective. He said that he did not feel like a man of this time, but rather a man of the early twentieth century. I feel lucky that our paths did cross and to have known Georg even for this short time. I feel a sense of loss at all of the discussions on the printing craft that we will not have. His death is a great loss to the entire letterpress community.

My sincere condolences to his family and friends.

Georg, wir geben Sie zurück ins Blei. Gott grüß die Kunst!
