body: "im trying to add Contextual Alternate feature to an Arabic font on Microsoft
  VOLT.\r\nThe font is shipping without any errors. However, the shipped font applies
  the marks differently then what i defined. plus the characters shift position either
  upwards or downwards, each set of glyphs behave differently.\r\nN.B: everything
  seems perfect when i use the proofing tool to check if what ive done is right on
  VOLT \r\n\r\nWhat is the problem? and how can i fix it?\r\n"

  body: "What applications have you seen the bad behaviour in? Adobe applications
    will behave differently to Microsoft applications for some things.\r\nHave you
    stepped through the lookups in the VOLT proofing tool to see if a lookup is shifting
    things in the same way as you are seeing in the application. Your shift values
    are obviously being interpreted differently by the application to how they are
    being used and displayed in VOLT, are they the correct way round?\r\n"

  body: "Patil, \r\nIf you see the marks shifting position in Adobe InDesign then
    you need to open the \"Diacritic Positioning\" menu and check one of the \"OpenType\"
    options instead of the \"Normal\" default. \r\n\r\nIn the settings of Loose, Normal,
    and Tight InDesign will position the marks where it sees fit. In the two OpenType
    settings it will use your OpenType lookups to position the marks. "
