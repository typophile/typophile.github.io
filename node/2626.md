body: Been tinkering around with a grayscale Thai font in my spare time. Don&#39;t
  have a full character set yet - nor digits &amp; punctuation. Just thought I&#39;d
  throw it out there to the wolves. Prematurely, so to speak, with no real pressing
  questions on the mind just yet. It&#39;s a bit more text-oriented than the last
  Thai face I posted here. Incidentally, I&#39;m using black &#43; 3 grays. I may
  try cutting down to 2 grays. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23627.gif"

  body: Looks a little clotted on my end. Would look less so on Macs &#40;due to the
    flatter gamma&#41;, but still too much adjacency in the grays. I&#39;ve found
    that there&#39;s still a strict limit to the effectiveness of gray pixels, and
    when you cross that limit you trade in too much crispness for fidelity. <BR> <BR>Two
    grays is better than three for a true bitmap font &#40;since it requires one less
    bit of data per pixel&#41;, but for pixelfonts it&#39;s moot. On the design end,
    I&#39;ve found that three grays can make a big difference &#40;over two&#41;,
    especially for light &#40;1 pixel stem&#41; fonts. Using different grays on the
    insides and outsides of abrupt curve transitions works much better than using
    the same gray on either side. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '&#62;Macs &#40;due to the flatter gamma&#41; <BR> <BR>Yeah, I realized it
    looks totally different on a Mac and a PC. I didn&#39;t know there was that big
    of a perceptible difference between the gammas of the two. It might be interesting
    to do a informal online study of which grays look better among PC CRT, PC flat,
    Mac CRT, &amp; Mac flat. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, I stripped this down to one gray &amp;
    I figure I might work up from there - rather than vice versa. And I see what you
    mean about the loss of crispness. There&#39;s a huge difference. <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'The platform difference in gamma means that you need to avoid a certain ranges
    of grays, where things look exceptionally good on one platform but really bad
    on the other. Fortunately the gamma difference doens&#39;t make grayscale pixelfonts
    hopeless though. <BR> <BR>Working up from too-few grays is indeed a great strategy:
    you can control the process much better, getting a feel for where crispness is
    losing out too much&#42;. In this case I would split that 178 into two, maybe
    something around 200 and another much darker. <BR> <BR>&#42; As well as minding
    the total bit depth in the case of  &#34;true&#34; bitmap fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp

    the end user reason more or less. Luckily that&#39;s my platform of choice, but
    I&#39;m lucky enough to work in a school where I can pop into a Mac lab whenever
    I want/need to ;-&#41; '
