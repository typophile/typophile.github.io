body: "hey, has anybody thought about names of typefaces appearing in pop songs. and
  - if they do appear - does that mean anything? like, is there some spiritual insight
  when type and music link?\r\n\r\ntake this for instance: i've always considered
  the HOBO being one of the most useless faces around, still it keeps popping up.
  then today, i found the song \"hobo blues\" by jack johnson - perfect fit or mere
  coincidence?\r\n\r\nlisten to this (hope it works...)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/music/wma-pop-up/B0000UX5IY001004/ref=mu_sam_wma_001_004/002-8441353-0353604\r\n\r\ndoes
  anybody else see the connection? \r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ncurtze"
