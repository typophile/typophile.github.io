  body: "Process Type's Lingua has an \"it\" combo, along with a lot of other oddities.
    Probably not what you're looking for, but worth taking a look at nonetheless.\r\n\r\nhttp://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/lingua/index.html"

  body: "The design director was asking. Yes, I've offered to make any ligatures he
    wants.\r\n\r\nThere's one in FF Govan and something in Apsect, though not a true
    ligature, just a dotless \"i\" with a swash lowercase \"t.\""
