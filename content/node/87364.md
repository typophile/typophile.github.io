    <em>LIFE</em> Bank Gothic or something similar, and <em>TAXIDERMY</em> Clarendon
    Light with a slant applied.\r\n\r\nCan\u2019t help with the others, sorry. "

  body: "Bookcoverarchive.com seems a brilliant resource... if the listed fonts can
    be relied on. Unfortunately not it appears.\r\n\r\nH&FJ Didot looks to be right
    for <em>still</em>, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sugargliderz/michel/|Michel
    Medium]] is also very close.\r\n\r\nSackers Gothic doesn\u2019t look correct for
    <em>LIFE</em> until you figure out it\u2019s Sackers Gothic Heavy specifically
    and these are the lowercase/small caps, not the caps. So a bit misleading there.\r\n\r\nThe
    author\u2019s name though, that\u2019s definitely not Trade Gothic (even the Condensed)
    with the straight sides on the O and G. Think it might be [[http://www.linotype.com/43170/AlternateGothicNo2-font.html|Alternate
    Gothic No. 2]]."
