  body: "Some cursive font makers (for example Signature Software) map the alternate
    cursive forms to upper ASCII characters (eg all those accented characters) they
    then use a macro to switch these alternates into a passage of text. Apart from
    being a bit of a hack, the text is not searchable or cut and paste-able, and if
    you switch fonts becomes gibberish. Another reason why OpenType is a better bet.

  body: "The Cursive handwriting font requires individual characters to have multiple
    beginning and ending strokes depending on the character pair combination used
    in a word. Around 1992 I designed and developed the typefaces for Zaner-Bloser
    Publishing who had the original drawing. Because the character set was limited
    I developed several font and a colleague designed a custom application to switch
    fonts on the fly. I assume this application is very similar.\r\nYour right Si,
    OpenType would have made the project more interactive."

  body: "Yes, font-switching would provide more accessible results - cut and paste
    and search would likely work. I made this IE font embedding demo a few years back
    which used that technique.\r\n\r\ndetails - http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/demos/8/about8.htm\r\ndemo
