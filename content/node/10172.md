body: I don&#39;t usually post this early in my project, but I&#39;ve got a serious
  issue that I need some help on. This is one for you intellectuals and ultra-business-minded
  communicators. <BR> <BR>I am struggling to even come up with a concept for my client
  because of the nature of his business direction &#40;which we need not spend time
  debating here&#41;. He has decided to make a career alteration which will include
  returning to practicing law &#40;mostly estate planning type stuff&#41; and real
  estate brokering. In my experience developing solutions for both of these types
  of professionals, I have discovered many dynamics that are unique to each type.
  I am not successfully thinking of a concept that will satisfy both. <BR> <BR>I know
  that there are some great minds out there, so I&#39;m hoping that some of you might
  have some stellar ideas on how to merge a legal practice and a real estate brokerage
  into one identity. Before I share any of my current considerations &#40;which are
  weak&#41; I will wait to hear your untainted response&#40;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thank
  you.

  body: Scott, stick with a type solution. Take the high road with this one. Just
    use the firms&#39; name and the abbreviation for Attorneys at Law. Use some elegant
    printing process for the stationary like blind emboss or foil stamp. Just some

  body: I agree with Daniel. I&#39;d err on the side of a lawyer identity. If you
    want or the client wants a mark, I&#39;d go very, very subtle and even then tend
    towards typographic &#40;monogram&#41; designs.

    Thank you for the &#34;counsel&#34; &#40;this job has put me in lawer mode&#41;.
    After abandoning an ambulance as an image, I developed some directions that are
    somewhat in line with what you&#39;ve both suggested. I will create a primarily
    typographical logo which will probably, but not necessarily have some associated
    imagery that leans more toward the lawerly side. <BR> <BR>I spent a lot of time
    brainstorming to come up with an image, voice and communicated purpose for The
    Law Office of Gary Saunders. After a couple of hours of scribbling notes and sketches,
    I found a couple of directions that successfully merge these two business interests
    &#40;law / real estate&#41;. The first direction, and the one that I favor, focuses
    on &#34;commitment&#34; &#40;contracts, pen, ink, paper, etc.&#41;, with a visual
    emphasis on people and reliability. The second approach also focuses on &#34;agreement&#34;,
    with a visual emphasis on handshakes and good old fashioned trust. I prefer the
    first, because it is serious and believable and the visuals I am coming up with
    are lawerly; while the second seems like it could be perceived as too old fashioned
    &#40;handshakes are no longer trusted&#41; and clich'

  body: With regard to printing, consider engraving. It has been classicly popular
    with Lawers for some time. It&#39;s a little more spendy, but will produce some
    great results. Results which are also difficult to reproduce cheaply in turn reducing
    the potential for fraud. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

    the design direction, it definitely makes sense to do something like that. If

    stuck with the mouthful, however, I was able to eliminate the LLC, which clients
    could care less about. <BR> <BR>My client paid me a visit today and saw the logo
    directions that I had posted earlier today, and he wants to push the third design,
    so that&#39;ll be the direction that I pursue from here on. Below is a JPEG rendering

  body: Scott, just make sure that the gold stamping is compadible with their lazer
    printers or you might have a problem. Also Scott you know you are making custom
    envelopes for this project. To achieve that effect they have to be printed then
    converted. Its more expensive and takes longer to get done. As long as the client
    is okay with that its a moot point. Are you going to print that color on the envelope
    &#40;Background&#41; or is it a stock color from a paper swatch. As for the pen
    I like it.

  body: Scott, nice work! &#40;I fell off the radar for a bit, so this is the first
    I&#39;m seeing of it.&#41; <BR> <BR>I agree with Tom and John, I like everything
    but the pen. Part of it is the fade on the pen. It makes it look like pre-fab
    stationary to me. For a law firm, I envision a crisp image, with defined edges.
    Essentially, I see it as grey &amp; fuzzy vs. sharp &amp; clean, and the latter
    wins. <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;m not anti-pen, but I&#39;m not feeling the execution.
    As it is, I think it&#39;d be stronger without than with. The fountain pen is
    a good choice for a law firm, so I&#39;d develop that. Perhaps make the body of
    the pen glossy, so you have reflections to work with in the mark to make it end
    cleanly? Not sure. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s definitely interesting that the firm wanted
    such a visually active stationary set, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprise if law firms
    start to open up their visual identities a bit, as the twentysomethings of today
    become the partners of tomorrow. Again, Scott, nice work.

    in and of itself, means different things to different people.&#34; <BR> <BR>The
    goal of an icon is to have recognition visually as to what you do. I am not saying
    that all icons are immediately recognized, but I feel that the pen is a mixed
    message. I don&#39;t think on every job there has to be an icon, especially if
    there isn&#39;t one that fits.  <BR> <BR>I know some of you argue that there is
    type that will be with the icon. But that backs up what many on here are saying-
    why have an icon at all. Why force something to work when it doesn&#39;t, especially
    when you have a classy clean type solution already. The pen will draw attention
    away from the foil stamp. <BR> <BR>Even with the pen, your work looks good as
    always Scott. Have a good weekend.
