    to do is round the corners.\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013&path=head\r\n\r\nAnother

  body: Already disccussed [[http://typophile.com/node/93971|here]]. Officially, the
    new [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_brooklyn_nets_i_call_technical_foul.php|Brooklyn
    Nets logo (including "BROOKLYN" lettering) has been designed by Jay-Z]] himself
    and should be considered as a custom job. I first thought about [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontboutique/noga/|Noga]]
    but, after having a closer look to the rest of the identity, [[http://www.nba.com/nets/|Nets'
    website]] and considering the love affair between Akzidenz-Grostesk and NYC, I
    guess a slightly manipulated [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/light-condensed/|Akzidenz-Grotesk
    Condensed Light]] (manually emboldened and rounded by adding an outline stroke)
    could do the job quite well.
