    Target=\"new\">Hightower</a> at MyFonts where you can test drive to match the
    sample.\r\n\r\n(I ID'd it using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\"
    target=\"new\">Serif Font ID Guide</a>. The 'a' is the fourth type, so is the
    'y' and the 'R', and then you look for the R in the 53 fonts that will show as
    matches for those three letters)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
