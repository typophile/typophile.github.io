body: "Okay. So I have been freaking out about fonts for the last couple of weeks.
  Specifically around EULA issues and what are my rights with fonts I have licensed
  directly, have been bundled with software (like Adobe), or that I downloaded from
  the internet in more innocent and less litigious times.\r\n\r\nI'm bleary from reading
  obtuse EULAs. My brain hurts from grappling with concepts of IP, derivative work,
  \"font software\" and other considerations. I just read the whole thread on the
  FontBureau / NBC debacle with a mixture of horror and fascination. (Kinda like a
  train wreck and you can't look away.)\r\n\r\nI want to put the 4,000-plus members
  of my font house in order and play by the rules. The prospect is just hideously
  daunting. I use FontAgentPro to manage my fonts and am able to sort the lists by
  foundry. I figured I'd try to prioritize documenting things based on which foundry
  represented the biggest chunk of my library.\r\n\r\nDuring my several days of research
  I learned <strong>The Legend of Southern Software</strong>. Not knowing any better,
  at some point I acquired one of their products with several hundred fonts. Setting
  aside questions of morality (they did a bad-bad thing) and questions of quality
  (why wear a knock-off Dior when you can get the real thing), I have a question of
  legality.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, since they went out of business, does that void any
  EULA that may have existed and render any fonts sporting the SSI foundry appellation
  as free and unrestricted for use in any way, shape or form? Is there any entity
  that survives that has any power to enforce any EULA that might have existed? I
  searched the entire forum and read every post that mentioned Southern and, other
  than generally disparaging comments about them, I could not find an answer to my
  question.\r\n\r\nThe others on my \"top ten foundries to sort out\" list are:\r\n\r\nAdobe
  Systems\r\nApple\r\nBitstream\r\nInternational Typeface\r\nLinotype\r\nMicrosoft\r\nMonotype\r\nURW\r\nand
  the dreaded Unknown!\r\n\r\nIf anyone has been through this process and has pointers,
  please write!\r\n\r\nRobert"

    I documented in 2005\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/ssi.pdf\r\n\r\nthe
    crucial question is whether SSI went broke or not.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you also
    mention URW, which went broke\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/typeworks1.pdf\r\n\r\nand
    therefore URW lost the rights to the URW fonts which I documented at my website
    (see the documents on Typeworks, Euroworks etc.)\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the referrals to the PDF documents, Uli. The one in English (Southern
    Software) does not really answer my question: Is there still any enforceable EULA
    in effect since SSI no longer exists. (The ssifonts.com site simply opens on of
    those annoying URL squatter sites.)\r\n\r\nThe PDF regarding URW is in German
    and \"mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut!\" A bit down the Google chain it seems that
    URW indeed went bankrupt and was reconstituted as URW++. \r\n\r\nSo a similar
    question would be: Are the URW fonts no longer covered by a EULA? Secondarily,
    how does one distinguish a URW font from a URW++ font?\r\n\r\nJust trying to sort
    out my decision tree about what to keep and what to lose.\r\n\r\nRobert"

  body: "Be careful with any font copyright information given by Uli Stiehl. He's
    notorius of accusing foundries of \"forging\" or \"plagiarizing\" others, but
    he is not really well informed (nor am I, but I'm not pointing fingers at others
    in a moralizing way) about all the to-and-fro licensing that took place or may
    have occurred between foundries. \r\n\r\nURW, e.g., have digitized a number of
    fonts for established foundries and, in return, reserved the rights to use the
    outlines (but not the original names) and have sub-licensed these outlines again
    to other foundries. So not every \"clone\" is illegal (talking of pre-digital
    font design digitized by URW). \r\n\r\nIn Europe the font design cannot be protected
    longer than 25 years, while the names are treated as trademarks and thus protected
    for a much longer time. In the US where you live the situation is not quite clear,
    AFAIK it is contentious whether fonts are \"software\" and as such protected by
    copyright. That's why foundries like to say \"font software\" for fonts. \r\n\r\nAfter
    all the legal trouble Southern Software had before they went out of business I
    don't think anyone who has inherited rights of that company will try to impose
    the regulations of their EULAs on anyone. So the question is more or less about
    morality rather than of legality. \r\n\r\nAndreas"

    far as I know, SSI sold its font CD without EULA.\r\n\r\nSSI charged less than
    1 Cent for 1 font !!!\r\n\r\nSSI advertised its \"a dime a dozen\" CD as follows:\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Southern

    office in Munich (or better for all countries of Europe in Alicante).\r\n\r\nHere
    are two interesting examples for Typophile discussion:\r\n\r\n1) If you registered
    <strong>\"Nimbus Roman\"</strong>, which is a clone of <strong>\"Times\"</strong>,
    at the German patent office in Munich, would you cheat the registration office,
    if you claimed on the registration form that <strong>\"Nimbus Roman\"</strong>
    is an original font design?\r\n\r\n2) If you registered <strong>\"Nimbus Sans\"</strong>,
    which is a clone of <strong>\"Helvetica\"</strong>, at the German patent office
    in Munich, would you cheat the registration office, if you claimed on the registration
    form that <strong>\"Nimbus Sans\"</strong> is an original font design?\r\n"

    you will understand that even if an SSI EULA had existed, it would have been invalid.

    your SSI EULA question is hypothetical.\r\n"

  body: "I just ran across a bunch of SSi fonts on some of those font download sites,
    and wanted to know if they were pirated. Presumably, even if SSi only copied designs
    and not actual outlines, so that they were legitimate (which is not clear, since
    this thread mentions they had legal troubles), these fonts are at best abandonware;
    they are not actually free fonts.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Found the Wikipedia article on
    the Adobe lawsuit; they did copy the outlines, so the fonts are not legitimate."
