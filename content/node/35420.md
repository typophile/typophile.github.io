body: "I convinced someone at a bookstore to call me whenever he is throwing an old
  book with illustrations away bacause it is falling apart. This particular book only
  had one illustration that seemed worth scanning, but I did find this interesting
  lettering. There are the non-recurring words from the section titles. So the reason
  for this ID is simply if this somehow has escaped being noticed by type people,
  then the lettering won't be lost for historical reference.\r\n\r\nBook title: Hunting
  Scenes in the Wilds of Africa. No author listed, and no date, but an inscription
  show it was given to someone by \"Grandma\" in 1886. John Potter & Co. of Phil,
  PA listed as publisher.\r\n\r\nIf it has never been digitized, and someone wants
  it, I have a 1200 dpi .tif of this lettering.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sampleletters_4387.jpg]"
