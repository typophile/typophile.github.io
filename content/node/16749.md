body: I have a pal who is an 18th century compartive lit Prof. He is interested in
  learning more about what innovations and events occur in printing/type during the
  18th century. What sources do you think are most helpful and accurate? I should
  mention that while he is interested to some extent in design shifts, his interest
  is more literary, social & economic than it is design centered. So information about
  trade in metals needed and or paper or ink making, or the politics of printing might
  are fair game too. Thanks!

    tangentially. In addition to controversial typeface designs (and they did seem
    to be quite controversial in Britain and her colonies), he also developed new
    kinds of glossy paper, and ink. This allowed him to print with his new types,
    which on \"normal\" paper would have broken up (too many thins, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe
    French Romain du Roi comes in at the tail end of the 1600s, with the first real
    type being cut around 1702, I think. That might be too early. The Fournier family
    must have developed some technology stuff. Didot and Bodoni come along later at
    the century, although I think that Bodoni's \"innovations\" might happen too late
    to be purely 18th century (???).\r\n\r\nWeren't there attempt to standardize type
    sizes during this century?"

  body: "I believe in England and the American Colonies for the middle part of the
    century, and till nearly the end (when the colonies became the US), Caslon's types
    dominated. So the Lit. Professor could look into Caslon's history as well. See
    the articles by James Mosley in <a href=\"http://www.printinghistoricalsociety.org.uk/\">Journal
    of the Printing Historical Society</a>. For earlier history and background Harry
    Carter's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0907259219/qid=1134398070/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3857683-9401545?n=507846&s=books&v=glance\">'A
    View of Early Typography'</a> is invaluable. Caslon's types were modelled after
    Dutch types, and these are another important story for the Continent. And older
    types continued to be used on the Continent, I believe. \r\n\r\nIf your friend
    really wants to study this in depth, he should contact the <a href=\"http://www.virginia.edu/oldbooks/\">Rare
    Book School</a> at the University of Virginia. They have programs, with teachers
    from around the world, specifically for people with his type of interest. "

    the Best of Fine Print Magazine</em>, 1989), he places historic developments in
    papermaking in conjunction with specific type designers, more scholarly than technical,
    but with investigative research.\r\n\r\nNot to cite too many lines from the five
    page article, here are a few choice paragraphs:\r\n<ul>\r\n<em>\"Originally papers
    were smoothed manually by means of an agate stone, but by the mid-sixteenth century
    smoother paper surfaces were achieved in German through the process of 'schlagstampfen'
    (strike-stamping).\"\r\n\r\n\"In Holland, a method was developed by which sheets
    of paper were pressed between wooden rollers made from logs, the forerunners of
    modern satinizing calenders.\"\r\n\r\n\"The English typefounder and printer John
    Baskerville, creator of the charming baroque types named after him, possessed
    a secret method for smoothing and evening paper. His books distinguished themselves
    by both the silky sheen of their paper surface and the excellent reproduction
    quality of his types. The German philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg
    visited his house and shop shortly before Baskerville's death. He was shown punches
    and matrices but was unable to discover the secret behind the smoothing of the
    \ papers. Certain experts believe that the paper was pressed between hot plates
    made of copper.</em>\" </ul>\r\nMore theories on Baskerville's method follow,
    plus the article continues with developments during the times of Bodoni, Jenson,
    Granjon."
