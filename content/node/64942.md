  Block from Berthold. \r\nThe only information I can find about Block is \"file magazine\",
  the year and the designer.\r\nAbout Mainorm I just found the year and the designer.\r\n\r\nI
  would like to find a critique or a list of companies using the types.\r\n\r\nCan
  anybody help with more experience? \r\nThank you!"

    (among others?) for this company:\r\nhttp://www.maireder.at/Funkberater.html.\r\nCan't
    see it in his other designs.\r\nBerthold Block is quite ubiquitious.\r\nWhat do
    you need that information for?"

  body: "THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nI always like to know something about a type before I buy
    it or recommend it for a logo design. The history and former usage is very interesting
    to know, but sometimes there is not so much information on the internet.\r\n\r\nSo
    I thank you very much for your help."
