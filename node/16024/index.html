  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Guys,

I'm just after a little advice. Been talking to my lecturer today and he thinks I've got a realistic chance of getting on the MA at RCA "MA Communication Art and Design" course.

What I want to know is, what is the real 'benefit' of continuing my education at an institute such as this? I realize that many many talented designers come from places such as this, I’m just not so sure if I need an extra, 2 years of education to refine myself as a designer.

I'm not from a 'wealthy' background and I realise the implications of taking on such a course. It will cost a lot of money. Again, is it worth it?

I'm just weighing up the pro's and con's. I have to submit a proposal pretty soon on why I would like to continue my education at the RCA. I reckon I’ll have a go, and see what happens. It’s pretty competitive I think so I’d be lucky to get in, if I don't then its not the end of the world.

Any advice is really welcome.

Cheers,

Rob.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I recently elected to get a real design job instead of going to grad school. I made decision because I felt there was more for me to learn in the real world than in more school. I would really like to get a masters in the future but, at the time, I felt like I needed to balance all of the theory and idealism of school with some experience and reality. It's been a great decision so far, I managed to get a really good job where I feel constantly challenged and have been learned a ton. Anyway, thats my story. I hope you come to a decision that is best for you. If you can't make up your mind, apply anyway and decide later. Good luck.</div>

I need to think things over. They don't have open days till Jan which is after the submission deadline strangely. So i'll visit, and keep collecting information until then I think.

Thanks for that jackson, very helpful indeed.
