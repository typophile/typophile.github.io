body: "I\u2019ve been trying to figure this out on my own for weeks now and thought
  I\u2019d run it by the forum. My ligatures, which are pretty basic, are working
  properly in AI CC, but not in INDD. The character space is being placed on top of
  the glyph. I\u2019m not sure if the error is cased by FontLab or INDD. I\u2019ve
  thought maybe it is because it is a reversed font. Can anyone point me in a direction
  to expire to help solve this? Below are screen grabs of the error and the Open Type
  code. Thank you."

    assume this is an assumption on behalf of InDesign; John Hudson has suggested
    that InDesign inserts the space glyph to keep the character count even \u2013\_that
    might very well be the case. Thanks for pointing out that issue, I will investigate.\r\n"

    CS6 and CS5.5 as well. Bummer if it is an extra space added by INDD."
