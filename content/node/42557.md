  body: "You <em>must</em> check out http://chinese-forums.com and http://how-to-learn-any-language.com
    if you haven't already. They have advice about how to study on your own and even
    what programs to do when you're in China.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this
    on Chinese-Forums, but I want to mention that it's generally much cheaper and
    not really difficult to sign up directly throught the university rather than going
    through one of the companies like Educasian."

  body: No, I've just read about it. They're all almost exactly the same. I used the
    International Students Center, which wasn't too overpriced and organized a few
    trips, but I think I should have gone directly through the school.
