    moderators\r\n\r\nBefore Chris has replied, this thread was not in my track list
    anymore. Why? And why do I get the following message, when I reload this page,

  body: "Arno -- every time you've updated this thread lately, the new AntiSpam module
    keeps flagging it as spam. It's happened three times so far today. \r\n\r\nEach
    time it gets flagged as spam, the node gets unpublished and held for moderation.
    That's why it disappears from your tracking list and you get a server error. \r\n\r\nI
    keep submitting it as a false positive, and hopefully the algorithm will someday
    learn to stop flagging it.\r\n\r\nUntil then, you'll just have to be patient.
    Florian, me, and the others can't keep tabs on things 24/7. "

    that I can create a blog entry. I think about moving the attachment container
    to the blog section.

    to the blog section.\r\n\r\n@ Kent\r\n\r\nIf a member tries to spam the forum,
    it is banned, correct? And if a member was not banned, this means, that the member
    wrote something, that is related to the forum. So the new spam software should
    only queue those suspicious posts, that were written by new members, that had
    not post anything, that was forum related in a certain time period, three days
    for example.\r\n\r\nExcept from that I have edited my account a few times yesterday
    (the additional information). Whenever I have done this, I had to fill in all
    fields again, because all fields were empty.\r\n\r\nBy the way the link \u201CView
    recent blog entries\u201D should be moved next to \u201CView | Edit | Track\u201D
    in my opinion."

    with Jared about trying to find ways to improve it\u2019s behavior without having
    to ditch it altogether. \r\n\r\nIronically, Jared just turned off the AntiSpam
    for general forum contents, but left it on for Blog posts \u2014 at my request,
    since that\u2019s where we get the most spam. And that\u2019s right when you decided
    to move your container to your blog (which is what I was going to suggest anyway),
    so it got caught again.\r\n\r\nIt should be live now. The AntiSpam thinks that
    the kind of updates you keep adding are suspicious. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re looking
    into a plug-in that would allow white-listing, so we can get past false positives
    for long-standing members. Please be patient.\r\n\r\n<cite> > By the way the link

    see this comment. Or you might submit the suggestion via the Bug Reports and Feature

    asked for this bug to be fixed several times, because everytime I have to clean
    up SEO links in spammer accounts, I face this problem. So believe me, it\u2019s
    100x worse for us admins than it is for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Arno \u2014 \r\n\r\nYou might refrain from constantly updating the main post
    in your Attachment and Bookmark Container blog node. Each time you do, it keeps
    winding up unpublished and back in the moderation queue. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
    nothing I can do to stop that from happening right now. And I can\u2019t spend
    all Sunday watching the queue in order to keep putting your blog back online.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    you should consider adding any updates as comments in that blog thread instead,
    since those will now slip by unfiltered and not take the whole thread offline
    each time."

    bookmarks and attachments in the same box with the help of the list tags. I dislike
    the new feature, because I neither can group the links nor I can name the links
    nor I can mark anything else than the initial post of a thread, but at least in
    case of one of my links it shows to a specific post, at which the thread began
    to interest me."
