  see it in advertising and even packaging design.\r\n\r\nIn Lithuanian language we
  have letter \u201Eu\u201C with \u201Eogonek\u201C. And this ogonek is put on wrong
  place in Helvetica regular system font (Leopard OSX today). See attachment[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u_ogonek_5133.jpg]\r\n\r\nPlease
  anybody: if You know person in Apple or related, push him to correct this thing.
  \r\n\r\nWe learned to put ogonek on the right at school:) And our grands do so:)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\u017Dydr\u016Bnas."

  body: "It seems this only affects the Regular and Oblique styles of Helvetica (not
    Neue), TrueType (v.6.0d7e1). Bold and Bold Oblique are in line with your \u2018good\u2019
    sample, aren\u2019t they?\r\nThe version that came with Tiger (OSX 10.4, v.5.0d8e2)
    looked different; with the ogonek at the right position, albeit detached.\r\nPretty
    inconsistent."

    most cases, esp. internet) and oblique.\r\n\r\nDavid yes, myriad with right position
    is in the example:)\r\n\r\n\u017D."

    wonder why they don't? Licensing issues? ;-) As I recall it all got a bit interesting
    when Apple claimed Myriad was being used on the first color iPods - but those
    references mysteriously disappeared... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podium_Sans "
