  a nice glyphs where lower case letters sit in the space just above the upper case
  L's arm. Is there a name for that sort of thing? Are there other typefaces with
  this kind of glyph built in?"

    And yes, this font deserves those two exclamation points.\r\n\r\nFrom a typographic
    point of view, it's just another ligature -- an aesthetically pleasing variant
    of two or more characters, designed by the font designer him/herself."
