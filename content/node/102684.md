  the letters HB. I've currently got it set in a modified (the B) but am struggling
  to find a sans face that pairs well and has enough weights to complete the company
  name and a lighter descriptor underneath. I've looked at quite a few faces\u2014FF
  Clan, FF Marselis and Proxima Nova to name a few\u2014but just am not yet satisfied
  with the results.\r\n\r\nThere is a great article written by the designer regarding
  its creation. I don't have an extensive knowledge of what pairs really well together
  so I am looking for suggestions. Any would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/2011/10/05/the-making-of-ff-tundra/\r\n\r\nThanks."
