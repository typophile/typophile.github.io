  put the locl feature on top so it overrides everything.\r\n\r\nI font know the language
  really, but tried to make some sense out of it.\r\n\r\nThe glyph \"i.dot\" is a
  copy of i.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/turskishi_5110.png]"

  body: "The underlying reasoning is that 'i' \"ee\" and '\u0131' \"ih\" are two different
    characters. Capitalizing and small-capitalizing in a Western locale loses the
    dot, which makes it a different character in Turkish.\r\n\r\nYou don't really
    need an \"i.dot\" glyph (as dotted equivalent of \"dotlessi\"), you can use the
    regular latin 'i' for that. So the translation you specify is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe
    only caveat is, for Turkish you should translate \"i\" to \"idotaccent.sc\" for
    small caps, and \"i\" to \"Idotaccent\" for capitals. The dotless 'i' can be converted
    to a 'regular' small cap I and capital I, for any locale, so it doesn't need a
    localized handling.\r\n\r\nYou <em>will</em> get bonus points if you weed out
    the ligatures containing an \"i\" for Turkish, such as \"fi\" and \"ffi\" :-)
    (As a side note, your translation of 'i' to 'i.dot' may rule out that lookup;
    but I still think it makes life more complicated, instead of less.)"

    Turkish i upstream, in 'locl', makes the code for other features (e.g. 'liga',
    'smcp') much much simpler."

  body: "Goran, your approach is good, but there are some issues,\r\n\r\n1. <code>languagesystem
    dflt dflt;</code> is incorrect.\r\nIt should be <code>languagesystem&nbsp;DFLT&nbsp;dflt;</code>\r\n\r\n2.
    If you want to be thorough, you can include other languages that need the same
    treatment such as Azeri (AZE) and Crimean Tatar (CRT).\r\n\r\n3. You can actually
    remove the substitution \r\n<code>sub&nbsp;i.small&nbsp;by&nbsp;idotaccent.small;</code>
    \r\nfrom the 'locl' feature. The reasoning for this is, the glyph 'i.small' won't
    be in the glyph stream until 'smcp' is applied. Since 'locl' comes before 'smcp'
    (and assuming that the text engine will do the right thing which is apply the
    lookups in the order they appear in the font), at the time 'locl' is applied the
    glyph 'i.small' won't be available as input. \r\nIn any case, don't forget to
    include the following substitution in 'smcp',\r\n<code>sub i.dot by idotaccent.small;</code>\r\n\r\n4.
    <code>idotaccent.small</code> is not a good name because 'idotaccent' is not a
    standard name. ('Idotaccent' is, but that's different). You need to call it something
    like 'i.dotsmall'.\r\n\r\n"
