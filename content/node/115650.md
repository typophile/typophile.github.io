body: "Hello \r\n\r\nI recently got in to a heated discussion with a designer friend
  of mine, who believes \"Zapfino\" can never be used in graphic design or art to
  produce \"amazing\" work.\r\n\r\nI personally think typefaces are like tools, each
  with a spectrum of uses or applicable scenarios. Some typefaces have a wide spectrum
  of uses while some have a much narrower window. I think to suggest that a typeface
  can never be used to produce beautiful work is underestimating human creativity
  and the infinity of creative possibilities. \r\n\r\nI have tried to find examples
  of Zapfino used amazingly but have not managed the  knock-out punch. I would greatly
  appreciate help in locating these.\r\n\r\nPlus what do you guys think about this
  debate in general. \r\nIts my first time here so be nice. Thank you. "

  body: "My guess is that most designers would shirk from using it not because the
    typeface itself is bad \u2013 but because it's a common typeface found on consumer
    computers, and thus is used in endless amateur publications. Combined with its
    distinctive looks, this has the unfortunate and rather unfair effect of <em>making
    it associated with</em> amateurism; all typeface \"meanings\" are, of course,
    socially contructed, and this would play into that.\r\n\r\nZapfino is certainly
    not the only good typeface that's underused for this reason."

    You'd be better served in the General Discussions section.
