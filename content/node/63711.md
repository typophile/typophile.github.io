  logo I designed ten years ago for my father's company... originally designed in
  MS Paint. While I don't plan on changing the logo itself there has been a lot of
  change in what fonts have been used. The one you're viewing currently is the most
  recent choice but I was wondering if anyone had any input on what would aesthetically
  be best.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the following is an excerpt about the company for some
  background information.\r\n\r\n\"HR Privacy Solutions is a New York-based management
  consulting practice focused exclusively upon helping clients meet the privacy challenges
  involved in the collection and use of employment-related personal information.  Our
  clients are U.S. and Canadian multi-national employers and employer service providers
  needing assistance in complying with domestic and international privacy laws.\"\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any thoughts you might have."

    Solutions considered hiring say, a designer or firm to develop the logo this out
    for them? I guess I don't understand this post at all. There are lots of fonts
    that could work, but it would involve a lot more research into the companies goals
    and branding strategy."
