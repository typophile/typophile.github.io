  glyphs in a pseudo-random fashion to create a more realistic handwritten font using
  OpenType, but very few examples. \r\n\r\nI would love to purchase a handful of these,
  but I'm surprised at the seeming lack of availability. Can someone point me in the
  right direction?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nScott"

  body: "Hi Scott, \r\nYou may find lots of handwriting fonts on Dafont, but none
    of them have the Opent Type magic.\r\nAs Nick and Cristobal suggested: Olicana,
    Rollercsript and Suomi Hand are the closer you will get to real handwriting. If
    those are not enough, then you need a custom-made font for your client.\r\n\r\nI
    recently did a custom handwriting font for a huge corporate client, with 5 variations
    of each letter, pseudo-random lowercase, pseudo-random uppercase, automatic small-caps,
    all 105 Latin languages including Vietnamese, etc, etc.\r\nBut this kind of custom
    jobs are expensive, around 30.000 USD. I don't know if your client can afford
    it, or if they want to spend that much.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the options are:\r\n-
    Search dafont for handwriting fonts, but all the letters will be the repeated
    (not natural effect)\r\n- Use one of the best already-available fonts (Olicana,
    Rollercsript or Suomi Hand)\r\n- Hire someone to make a custom font for your client
    (Best solution, but expensive)"
