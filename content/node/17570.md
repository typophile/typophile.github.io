  body: I've just been reading her book. She used old wood types (or images of old
    wood types from old specimen books). I don't think the specific fonts she used
    are available in digital form, but there are similar ones, as Patricia has noted.

  body: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if she created this custom for the Public Theater.
    They have beautiful posters, great typography.
