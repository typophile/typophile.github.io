body: This is probably an easy one for most of you. I&#39;m trying to figure out the
  typeface for the body text of the wall street journal. I used Linotype&#39;s font
  identifier and came up with New Century School Book, but I&#39;m not entirely convinced.

    target="_blank"> Mario R. Garcia</a> used the now called WSJ Scotch  <BR>Compressed,
    redrawn and enhanced by The Font  <BR>Bureau, for their <a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=3638"
    target="_blank"> redesign</a> of WSJ last year. <BR> <BR><b>STARTING THE PROCESS
    BY EXAMINING THE PAST</b> <BR> <BR>Garcia and Joe Dizney, the paper&#39;s design  <BR>director,
    the launched a &#39;visual archeology&#39; of  <BR>the paper. This involved going
    back into the files  <BR>and studying typefaces that had been used with  <BR>a
    view to seeing what could be kept or restored,  <BR>what could be added without
    disturbing the  <BR>identity of the paper, and reflecting on what  <BR>could be
    improved. <BR> <BR>They excavated an assortment of typefaces,  <BR>including Caslon,
    Scotch Roman and several  <BR>different sans serif faces. They found that over  <BR>the
    years as various typefaces were added to the  <BR>typographic system, the paper
    had become jumbled  <BR>and inconsistent. To solve that problem, they  <BR>streamlined
    the typographic structure by deciding  <BR>on three main faces. <BR> <BR>Scotch
    was the original typeface for headlines,  <BR>used from the beginning. It was
    an important face  <BR>and people identified it as The Wall Street Journal. <BR>
    <BR>For that reason, it was retained for headlines,  <BR>but redrawn to make it
    look less Victorian and  <BR>more contemporary. It was redrawn and enhanced  <BR>by
    The Font Bureau. It is now called WSJ Scotch  <BR>Compressed. <BR> <BR><b>The
    redesign of the WSJ typeface Scotch.</b> <BR>Multiple line headlines of Scotch
    Compressed were  <BR>kept and two-line headlines were added on the  <BR>front
    page, allowing for more information in the  <BR>headlines. <BR> <BR>Franklin Gothic
    was preserved and redrawn to  <BR>refresh its look, and used for charts, graphs,  <BR>inside
    boxes and other visual elements like  <BR>interior labels, providing good contrast
    to the  <BR>elegant Scotch. The bold weight that Franklin  <BR>Gothic provides
    is the kind of weight that draws  <BR>the eye and provides a strong navigational
    device  <BR>for the reader. <BR> <BR>Because stock listings were so important
    to the  <BR>paper, research was done to find the most readable  <BR>face. Retina
    was chosen. This is the first time  <BR>Retina has been used in a newspaper. It
    was  <BR>redrawn by Tobias Frere Jones of the Hoefler Type  <BR>Foundry. <BR>
    <BR>The nameplate was an important recognizable  <BR>element that had to stay.
    But it looked &#39;funereal&#39;,  <BR>according to Dizney. So it was cleaned
    up and  <BR>made to look more contemporary by California-based  <BR>type designer
    <a href="http://www.typedesign.com/" target="_blank"> Jim Parkinson</a>. The change
    was <a href="http://www.typedesign.com/logos/wsj.html" target="_blank"> subtle</a>.'

  body: The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> uses WSJ Scotch for headlines. But that&#39;s
    not the text face, as far as I know. HTF&#39;s Retina is used for stock listings.
    Franklin Gothic is used for some sans. But none of these is used in the sample
    originally posted. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t tell for sure from the online sample and
    I don&#39;t have the paper close at hand, but it seems to be based on Century.
    Various members of the Century family have been used for news before. This is
    not New Century Schoolbook, though. Century has also been the basis for custom
    news faces. But I&#39;m not sure what this one is.  <BR> <BR>It could possibly
    be FB&#39;s Bureau Roman, which David Berlow based on Century Oldstyle. But the
    &#39;g&#39; doesn&#39;t look quite right in the scan above. <BR> <BR>Sorry, Yves,
    I think you need to keep looking before you claim victory on this one. <BR> <BR>--

  body: Okay, I&#39;ve got an actual sample of a <i>WSJ</i> page in front of me now.
    Now I see the Scotch elements of the text. It&#39;s not so much Century-based
    -- the &#39;g&#39; is clearly not a Century g. <BR> <BR>This text face bears some
    family resemblence to the WSJ Scotch headlines that Font Bureau designed, but
    it has distinctive differences in some letterforms -- aside from the obvious difference
    in proportions imposed by the demands of narrow-column news-text requirements.
    For instance, the treatment of the top of the &#39;t&#39;, the curl and bulb of
    the &#39;r&#39;, and the neck transition of the &#39;g&#39;. <BR> <BR>These design
    differences could be concessions to the needs of text, but they could indicate
    that the text design was not necessarily part of the WSJ Scotch commission. I&#39;ve
    got a message out to Cyrus to try to confirm this. <BR> <BR>A front-page PDF of
    the <i>WSJ</i> downloaded from the <a href="http://www.newseum.org" target="_blank">
    Newseum</a> indicates that the text is called &#34;DJ4DowText&#34;. But this same
    PDF indicates that a headline clearly set in FB&#39;s WSJ Scotch is in &#34;DJ4ScotchCd&#34;,
    so I don&#39;t know what that might indicate. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep you posted
    if I learn anything else. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    change the text face. <BR> <BR>So, getting back to the original question: as near
    as I can tell, the body text of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> is a proprietary
