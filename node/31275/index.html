ED ARNOLD ~ Remembrances from four friends
Thursday, February 8, 2007
MARIO GARCIA ~
The first book in the Bible of newspaper design
Long before the term design was ever associated with newspapers, there was Ed Arnold.
Long before there were Macs, or QuarkXPress, or SND, there was Ed Arnold.
In the book of newspaper design, Ed Arnold is the Genesis – the prologue to a rich story of how our craft developed. And the trailblazer – a lone, but resounding, and articulate, voice. I can't think of anyone else who could sit with a non-believing publisher and editor and convince them that packaging the news attractively was the key to getting readers to pay attention.
He set the stage for the rest of us in the same grand manner in which he did everything: a little bit of theater (no, make that a lot of theater), in which Ed, forever the star of whatever show he participated in, recited such words as "italics, picas, leading or Bodoni Bold" in a sort of staccato rhythm while he paced the room, one finger up in the air, professorial, authoritative, the audience captivated, all eyes on his friendly face.
This is the Ed Arnold I remember, the one I discovered as a freshman in college, when I read "Functional Newspaper Design" – a book I confess I read in one night, as if it had been a Hemingway novel. I remember that the next morning I was up early doing pencil sketches following his best axioms: "Don't neglect the bottom right hand corner of the page," or "Contrast is the key: Too much bold or too much light gets boring on the page."
Little did I know then that one day I would be the one to take his place (not that anyone ever could) at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications when he retired in 1977. Those were giant shoes to fill and I know that the same man who had inspired me as a college student continued to guide me as a young college professor.
We often met in the years that followed, and every time I learned something from Ed, like the time that we both coincided at an American Press Institute seminar, and I was experiencing trouble with a slide projector that would not work properly: "Mario, it is better not to use audio visual aids," he said from the back of a room, "I decided years ago that it is best to just talk, hold your newspaper pages up in the air, and you play it safe."
Not that he always played it safe himself: The Ed Arnold who designed newspapers around the globe was adventurous even in his travel preferences (Ed was in his 80s when I ran into him and he told me that he was working on a project in Ecuador, and traveling there on a cargo ship!).
He who had cut his teeth and worked most of his career with hot type, adapted quickly to the era of cold type, and wrote about it in one of his preeminent texts, "Ink on Paper 2" (1972).
Imagine what it took to move editors who loved vertical placement of text to consider a more horizontal architecture on their pages, but Ed convinced them to do that in the late 1960s. Not to mention that just when we thought "dog legs" (those twists and turns of type around unrelated stories) would be on newspaper pages forever, Ed designs The Christian Science Monitor following modular layout, and the world takes notice.
With modular layout, newspapers began to look more organized and less cluttered. With The National Observer, Ed not only brought modules starting from the first prototype, but introduced white space (gasp!) between unrelated stories.
Never one to imitate magazines' design in his work, Ed nonetheless had an appreciation for the clean organizational elements that made magazines stand out and easier to read than the newspapers of his era, and he managed to create page architectures that, while maintaining pure newspaper layout standards, also introduced the beginning of what I would call "design" into newspapers.
In doing this, Ed Arnold made our work easier.
Every week I remember something that Ed Arnold taught me. Perhaps the most important thing he transmitted to me, and to thousands of his students, was the passion that he felt for our profession. It never left him.
In our last meeting, in Washington, he told me that he was doing a project a year, and he described his work to me in detail, with the same excitement that was there when I first had met him 32 years before.
Long after his death, Ed Arnold will continue to influence what we do.
Newspaper design has lost its first and only true guru.
~ Mario Garcia is universally recognized as one of the news design industry's major voices. He is the founder and president of Garcia Media, and has more than 30 years of design experience, having redesigned more than 450 newspapers worldwide – including The Wall Street Journal, Die Zeit (Germany), El Mercurio (Chile), El Tiempo (Bogota, Columbia), and The Philadelphia Inquirer.</div>
