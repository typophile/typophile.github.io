  Alphonse Mucha, simply because I am a huge fan of the Art Nouveau style. I love
  the details he put into his illustrations. Also, he wasn't limited as an artist,
  he painted, sculpted, illustrated, etc. I love his use of soft, pastel colors to
  match the emotion that he was trying to convey. Lovely work. <3\r\n\r\nA link to
  his work:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.muchafoundation.org/MHome.aspx\r\n"

  body: His Art Noveau work is brilliant, but in your link, there was no mention of
    his work of Slavic work; he considered his most important these huge paintings
    he did during the socialist revolution, and had to live the reporcusions of the
    same movement.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The-Slavs-In-Their-Original-Homeland,-1912_6584.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/The-Apotheosis-Of-The-Slavs_5752.jpg]

    right \u2013  are now in display in the castle Moravsk\xFD Krumlov in Check Rebublick.\r\n\r\nThey
    were saved from both Fasist, and Bolshevic regimes, so that is good."
