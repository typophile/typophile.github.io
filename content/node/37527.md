  Liberty RWB_5311.JPG]\r\n\r\nHere are two ideas for my daughter's new travel soccer
  team logo.\r\nThe logo is two be used on promotional items and t-shirts, warmups,
  etc.\r\n\r\nThe League Colors are Black, White and Gold although the team coaches
  have suggested we try the more colorful and playful patriotic red white and blue.
  Any critiques please.  Thanks again.\r\n\r\nSorry for the size of the red, white
  and blue logo. Not sure how to adjust."

  body: "The first one has way too much going on and I don't really get the use of
    the pen and ink handwriting font set with borders and drop shadows. Maybe try
    the same theme but use an actual script face more suited to sports emblems.\r\n\r\nThe
    second one is quite nice, though not sure how 'athletic' it is."

  body: "Thanks for all your comments.\r\n\r\nThe font used on \"Liberty\" was to
    convey the writing similar to what was used during the Revolutionary Era and the
    signing of the Declaration of Independence.  I agree, though, that is not commonly
    used in Sports - but is that necessarily bad?  The colors that I used intentionally
    represent the uniform colors of black white and gold.\r\n\r\nThe second attempt
    is more patriotic and blatant with the red, white and blue and flag theme.  The
    graphic comes from a tracing of a flag soccer ball photo. \r\n\r\nEnjoying the
    feedback. Keep it coming please."

    and outlines just seems very contradictory. Those two styles just don't seen to
    mesh that well.\r\n\r\n"

  body: you might be able to use the statue of liberty torch with the i of liberty.
    I would go for a feminine font (girls team) e.g with contrast which will also
    match in with the heritage of the name. You could do the logo within a shield
    or cup or ball shape, although i prefer shield. Look at all the words in caps
    as it will add structure a solidness something you associate with football. Use
    colour to make it expressive. The logos you have are ok, the second one is much
    nicer than the first. I could associate the first one with a team called tigers
    at a push, it doesn't say football or liberty and font isn't nice. The second
    one is better but doesn't say anything to me.

    statue of liberty is a bit much...doesn't seem necessary to me.\r\n\r\nCan you
    tell us a bit more about the name Liberty? Why are they called that? What's the
    history behind that? "

  body: "Going with the second design was a smart move. Lose the Statue of Liberty\u2014it\u2019s
    starting too look like a parody of the Fox News in-house soccer team. It\u2019s
    also just not a remotely appropriate way to treat an important symbl (not that
    putting a flag on a soccer ball is much better, but people are used to tacky degradation
    of hallowed symbols when a\r\nsaid symbols are flags). Don\u2019t draw the flag
    to look distorted, it looks unnatural, instead draw it flat and wrap it around
    a 3D sphere.\r\n\r\nRegarding your type, I would recommend not using a serif type,
    but if you must, go with a simple slab serif. It\u2019s more sporty and more appropriate
    for the age of the players. Gotham Rounded would be a great sans type to use,
    Memphis would be a great slab serif that has a great combination of American and
    European elements that make it especially appropriate for a soccer team."

  body: I guessing your from New York and hence why you have called the team liberty.
    I think using some of the statue of liberty is a good idea, get it interacting
    with the type. Maybe just use the flame this gives the idea without the degradation
    that James is talking about. I wouldn't use the flag as I think it doesn't say
    local it says global, nor does it say liberty. Listen to the guys above as they
    know more about type and what to use. I'm not getting any feminism from it though.
    Simplicity is the key, drop what isn't essential. I love Football/soccer, hope
    you enjoy watching it!

    team of under-12 year old girls adopted the name from a league assigned name which
    also included the Eagles.  It is a New York team and the coach, a NYC Fireman,
    wanted to add the Statue of Liberty in some context.\r\n\r\nThe girls are a lot
    of fun to watch and are having a ball (no pun intended).  Thanks again for all
    your input."

  body: "From a practical point of view, what is the logo to be used on and how will
    it be applied, it seems to me that if it is on the team strip the type will be
    small, possibly too small to embroider, you might want to drop travel soccer from
    the logo (what is <em>travel</em> soccer anyway?); and shift liberty to the bottom
    you can then get a better proportion of text to image, while Copperplate does
    follow a curve quite well it is a broad face, for reasons of proportion you might
    want to consider something narrower. In terms of the image it should either be
    really well executed or dropped in favour of a simpler rendition at the moment
    there is too much of a clipart feel to it. My personal feeling is that a team
    logo shouldn\u2019t need a rendition of the sport.\r\n\r\nTim"
