  jobs, so it's still green and on first ball in some parts. \r\n\r\nA couple of facts:\r\n\r\n-
  I wanted to make an disco-metal-urban-fancy-cool-electro-ambiental... typeface;\r\n-
  Very rough and inaccurate version so far;\r\n- Proportions are not well also;\r\n-
  Some letters aren't good in some way (probably /S, P, R.../);\r\n\r\nAny constructive
  comments are more then welcomed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zajebancija_shiva_1_6716.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDusan"
