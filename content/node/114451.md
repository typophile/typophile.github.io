    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman-no-9/ Tail of a flips up.\r\nAlso
    pretty similar, with the same a tail flip problem CG Times http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/cg-times/
    and \r\nTimeless EF Light http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/timeless/\r\nas well
    as several more similars with the a flip tail.\r\nEither this is an edited logotype
    [Liberal Party?] or there is another  font. If there is I assume someone will
    post the match for you.\r\nDon"

  body: "My guess is that this is a Times 'clone' (almost). In other words, someone
    made a Times-like serif font, maybe mixing letters from some other serif. The
    'a' isn't the only problem. The L has an odd thick bracket on the right of the
    stem, and the i is very close to its dot. These could be earmarks of tinkering
    with Times to make something slightly different, to avoid accusations of copying
    the font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
