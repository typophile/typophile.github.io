body: I&#39;ve recently developed a font that has attracted the attention of someone
  I know who&#39;s designing a new magazine. He&#39;s asked if he can buy a copy and
  use it for titles and headings in the magazine. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not my understanding
  that he wants any kind of exclusivity for the magazine, and there&#39;s only one
  weight at the moment. <BR> <BR>Should I just sell him a copy of the font at it&#39;s
  normal price? Or should I ask for some sort of commercial/extortionate fee for it?
  I suspect the former but I&#39;d like to be told the latter ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance, <BR> <BR>Jordan

    just be able to sell it for the &#39;normal&#39; price.. <i>&#40; But what about
    some kind of &#39;temporary exclusive usage&#39;, like, lets say, that the magazine
    will be able to use it for one year, exclusively, before you can sell it to the
    general public.? &#41;</i>

    It should be some good publicity for the font anyway...

  body: 'I&#39;ve sold &#34;beta&#34; copies of some of my fonts, generally at the
    full [eventual/intended] price, without exclusivity, and with the promise that
    they will get the full version when it comes out. Also, the client and I &#34;use&#34;
    each other via feedback: the crits they give me are often applied, and if so of
    course end up in the final version they get. <BR> <BR>Just try to make sure of
    one thing: that copies of your beta won&#39;t end up floating around even before
    you release the real thing! That&#39;s a sure way to make zero dollars from it,
    not to mention create a version-control nightmare. So choose your &#34;beta-testers&#34;
    carefully. I&#39;ve stuck to dealing with Typophiles when I do that: I know they
    care about type; and being co-members of a society keeps both parties straight.

  body: Thanks for the advice Hrant,  <BR> <BR>The guy I&#39;ll be selling it to is
    -- if not a hardened typophile -- a fellow designer and -- if not a friend --
    a well known associate, so I think I can trust him with a beta copy if needs be
