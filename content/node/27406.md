  one, in some variations:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typographyyesterday_4274.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll
  critique is welcome.\r\n\r\nbtw: I tried to find some info on the Silom typeface,
  but I couldn't find too much. Only thing I know, is that it's standard on Mac, though
  not used too often. (Or am I completely wrong with that?)\r\nAnyway, I like to play
  with it."
