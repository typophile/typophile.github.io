  body: It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FE-Schrift">FE-Schrift</a>, used
    on German number plates. When it was introduced in Germany, there was a discussion
    among typographers about how ugly the new font was and how it defied the purpose
    of improved readability. I can see though how these quirky features can be used
    to give a design an urban look like in the example above.
