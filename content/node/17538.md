  morning in East London and finding this site is almost magiK, the font manipulated
  threads are great.\r\n\r\nI'm dabling in the world of 'type'n'logos', slowly moving
  from hand drawn predominantley graff letterforms into the world graphic type. I
  NEED TO KNOW what software you kind peoples use to edit and mess with the alphabet.
  I've essentially been scanning in my hand-styles and tweeking them in Photoshop,
  but it's a long and messy process. \r\n\r\nWould you kindly illuminate my foggy
  brainstem please, I've had a look at some of the design threads and confused myself
  immediately?\r\n\r\nI'm not interested in creating entire font sets, merely creating
  letters shapes accurately.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing Illustrator may do the trick partially?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks\r\n\r\nP\r\n\r\nwww.55designs.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Gabriel,\r\n\r\nReading about OpenType? scared me, and talk of glyphs
    flung me to the ground. I'm used to creating letters in a sketchpad and when I
    started flicking through some of the threads on here I realised I know nothing
    of the technical aspects of creating letters.\r\n\r\nI have Flash and Illustrator
    so that's a start - Could you give me a route to follow in terms of altering an
    existing letter. Would I use the type text tool in illustrator, break the letter
    into a path and then tweak the path, for instance?\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nP\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nIf you're not looking to produce working a working [[font]], but rather
    just creating \"digital lettering\", there's no real need to spend $500 on Fontlab.
    Although its tools might be more adapted to typeface design, it seems to me your
    work stands between text and illustration, so Illustrator should do fine, in fact
    it gives more possibilities with color, etc. \r\n\r\nAs to how to do it in Illustrator,
    you should type the text, convert it to outlines and then mess with it. If you
    don't already, learn how to draw using bezier curves.\r\n\r\nThat's how I do it,
    and I figure most people use the same technique for the type battle stuff. "

    accurate. Just reading up on Bezier curve tutorials as we speak - all sounds graspable...I've
    used illustrator to trace hand drawn stuff in the past, but have always gone about
    it in a really thuggish manner so this looks perfect...\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    responses both of you, enjoy the sun Tim, it's suddenly got really overcast up

  body: "Peter,\r\n\r\nGiven that you are doing hand work, and may or may not end
    up making type, consider this: Illustrator and the like have autotracing features.
    Try scanning your finished artwork at huge resolution and autotracing it. From
    that you can see how much accuracy the autotrace will give (adjust the preferences),
    and then from there make small adjustments to the outlines by tweaking. That way
    you will have real projects to learn the bezier tools with. If you want to move
    away from autotracing in the future, you can do that organically. There might
    be pieces you scan and then draw bezier outlines over by hand, like if the art
    is very regular or simple and sleek.  Meanwhile you can get more of your lettering
    in digital format so you can color it, move it around, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nOne way
    beziers might be useful to you is if you draw them with the pencil tool in illustrator.
    It makes the outline for you, which you can then touch up. Using the stroke feature
    with such outlines, then \"outline storke\" could take you places. \r\n\r\nYour
    work blends lettering, painting, decoration, and is very lively and energetic.
    if you learn to draw with beziers, I hope you will keep the energy and freshness
    your hand-lettering and sketches have. Nice work! "

    body: "Thanks alot CG...kind and useful words there. I'll definately play with
      the autotrace feature, although I traced a graff letter logo yesterday, learning
      beziers as I went and was really pleased with the result. The letters maintained
      and even gained a certain energy. I really had to concentrate on placement of
      anchors to keep the curves natural, and stylised but overall, being able to
      tweek the widths of stems and slashed within the design just made everything
      look better!\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice in this thread peoples...I wasn't
      sure I was flailing around using inefficient tools to acomplish something that
      could've been done a lot more easily with some other technique.\r\n\r\nMany
      thanks...today, in East London, it's cloudy btw...."

  body: "The nice thing is that beziers are useful for any kind of art, and they're
    also ideal for drawing letters.... Add the functions of a type drawing program
    and you've started to design type. If you've spent a lot of time drawing or writing
    letters then you have a head start. Lots of type designers work on shapes in Illustrator
    and then move them to FOG or FL. I tend to leave Illustrator for times when I
    just want a single piece of art. \r\n\r\nI just remembered a useful technique
    you might like: draw a little circle with the circle tool in illustrator, the
    exact width of your typical outline, stem width, or other repeated feature. Use
    it as a caliper or gauge for lines you want the same width. It works no matter
    what angle the lines are, since it's a circle. \r\n\r\nIt's cloudy in San Francisco
    as well. "

    body: "...excellent tip. I've always approached letters from a hand drawn point
      of view, but sometimes I forget that there are geometric rules that govern the
      flow of a piece. Looking at my favourite outlines again with this in mind I
      find obvious relationships between the size of stem widths, flicks and flares
      and so on, and although I've unconsciously rendered these as I've drawn, they
      definately define the fluidity of the piece in the end.\r\n\r\nI guess drawing
      with a constant reference such as a fixed number of circular guides, or at least
      tweeking my hand drawn stuff with these tools will hopefully improve the overall
      flow drastically.\r\n\r\nThanks again. It's now dark, and cold.\r\n\r\n "
