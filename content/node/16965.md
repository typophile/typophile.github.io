  Bodoni sc&osf</a>, but I don't like the Bauer Bodoni roman. I do like the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bodoni-mt/\">Monotype
  Bodoni roman</a>.\r\n\r\nDo you think it would be in bad taste to pair the Monotype
  Bodoni roman with the Bauer Bodoni osf?"

    is always dangerous because the text tend to become heavy & difficult to read.

  body: Depending upon the pt size of the type, the serifs on the Bauer Bodoni --
    and eventually if too small on the Monotype Bodoni -- will disappear. You might
    consider using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=ITC+Bodoni">ITC
    Bodoni</a>, incorporating the various sizes. This would, I would guess, answer
    your needs and give you the options without having to mix and match from two different
    families.

    revival worth considering."

    \ As Nick says, it has all the bits.\r\n\r\nBauer Bodoni is quite lovely but does
    not hold up in small sizes.  I always wondered if when Bauer was digitized, it
    was drawn as it was for hot metal where the hairlines would build up with ink-spread.
    \ No letterpress, no ink-spread. Bauer still looks luscious as a display face
    though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    likely that a larger size of the type was used as a master.\r\nA reasonable decision,
    considering that the Bauer foundry type Bodoni was the most exquisite version
    of the face, so if you're digitizing it, you keep that \"brand\" quality.\r\n\r\nBut
    enough of Bodoni. Haven't seen him at TypeCon recently and rumor has it that he's
    no longer with us.\r\nWhy not check out the new-fangled way of doing things, as
    selected in <a href=\"http://typographi.com\">Our Favorite Fonts of 2005</a> at
    Typographica?\r\nLots of lovely new serif designs, with all the bells, whistles,
    gongs and glockenspiels you could ever wish for. "

  body: I'm gonna second the Filosofia plug - I think it works really nicely at both
    small and larger sizes (altho large is a relative term when it comes to business
    cards, we're not exactly talking about a billboard) and is a tad fresher than
    Bodoni which Vignelli used to death.
