  so I'll do it here (oh, and one more thing, when's that automated password-sender-to-existing-members
  system going to be up and running?  I felt bad registering as a new member to do
  this).\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, big news.\r\n\r\nSo let me get this straight...\r\nI'm
  not complaining, just curious...\r\nAdobe acquires Macromedia; Adobe then sells
  Macromedia's Fontographer to Pyrus...\r\nI think this is, ultimately, really great--if
  you keep Fog with its current tools and manner of performing.  It seems like a matter
  choice, and giving people a choice of performance style is only reasonable.\r\n\r\nI've
  never had the chance to use Fog--when are you going to make a demo available?"
