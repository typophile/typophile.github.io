<p>I am right eye dominant and I perceive that the glyphs I am drawing look balanced with normal vision (obviously), or just my right eye. When I close my (dominant) right eye and look with my left eye my glyphs look skewed.</p>
<p>Does this mean that a right eye dominant audience perceive the glyphs in the same way as me, but the left eye dominant audience does not?</p>
<p>I just looked at a few other typefaces this way, I perceived them the same way, right eye balanced, left eye skewed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I think the phenomenon you are experiencing is unique to you and peeple with the same or similar eyesite conditions as yours.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess this is a theoretical anxiety, after all, there’s not much anyone can do to reconcile it!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Wanna put money on that? I have had many eye tests in the last two years to find out more and more about the impairment to my eyesite caused by the cerebral aneurysm I had in January 2007. I think you would be very surprized by what opthalmologists can tell you about your eyesite and the things they can do to correct numerous types of distortion and malfunction.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is what you mean by &ldquo;right eye dominant&rdquo;. Dominant in what way? Sharpness, luminance, focal length, or what?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the link Craig. It&rsquo;s interesting that the article reckons approximately two thirds of &ldquo;the population&rdquo; (human population?) is right-eye dominant. I think what 1985 experiences is &ldquo;. . .unique to you [1985] and peeple with the same or similar eyesite conditions as yours.&rdquo; because I don&rsquo;t experience dominance of one eye compared to the other, and neither do any other peeple I know. So, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve come accross occular dominance, so I guess the two thirds of the population said to be right eye dominant are mostly mild cases.</p>

<p>My son has mixed dominance. He throws with his right hand and kicks with his right foot, but very definitely prefers to sight through his left eye. Makes shooting a free throw the correct way difficult, as the ball will normally hide the left eye if you are right handed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>sounds like a defect on your left eye 1985, not a plus or minus but cylindrical defect,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astigmatism (cylindrical defect): When some-one has a cylindrical defect, the eye is not spherical. Mostly this appears on the cornea, but it can also be somewhere else. Because of this, the light is not broken in one direction, and because of that the sight will be distorted. Often this occurs combined with long- or short sightedness. It is possible to put this right by using cylindrical glasses, lenses or a laser treatment.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It’s not the eye that sees, but the brain. Images passed on by both eyes are processed into a representation and that is where it becomes muddy: the brain makes decisions about what we want to see and what not. Eg if you are focused on things being level, your perception gets tuned to that (the famous carpenters’ eye).</p>
<p>Most important is the fact that most people use two eyes and the brain mixes inputs. When you use just one eye it takes some time for the brain to adapt.</p>
<p>Example: a few years ago I had my eyes lasered. The right one has perfect vision now, which means it is perfectly suited for seeing far off. My left eye has been corrected to about minus 2.5 and is well suited for distances from 60 cms to about 120 cms (I can use my computer without needing glasses — reading is a different matter). My brain picks what it needs — learning that took just a few weeks. 
Anecdote: My eye doctor told me that elderly people who have their vision restored (removing cataracts and such) sometimes can not adapt and remain virtually blind. Or fall over all the time.</p>

Anyone know of any decent opticians in London (UK)?</div>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was on a subway platform, looking at the tiles on the wall, and I noticed that the grid looked distorted&hellip; But only when I looked at it with my left eye (I am right-eye dominant&hellip; I had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strabismus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a child). Anyway, I went to see my optician and sure enough I had a (temporary) problem! There is a test you can do with a simple grid printed out on paper&hellip; If any of the lines look round or diagonal, then you might have the same condition I had.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Ricardo. I am trying to get an appointment scheduled! I had to wear an eye patch as a child to correct what everyone referred to as a squint, I guess that might have been a strabismus? I went last year to an opticians but something didn&rsquo;t feel right about the prescription, the frames were expensive etc and it never materialized. I really ought to sort it. Thanks again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re welcome, 1985! I had to use an eye patch, too. :-) I would alternate between covering the right eye one day and the left eye the next. It&rsquo;s usually used for what they call &ldquo;lazy eye,&rdquo; or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->amblyopia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The idea is that you will force the &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; eye to work harder on the days you cover the &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; eye. Strabismus is when you are cross-eyed, and that can be corrected with surgery. Read more about strabismus and amblyopia <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (they are not the same thing!).</p>
<p>Try to go to an eye doctor (that is, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist) rather than an optician. In my experience, at least, an optometrist or ophthalmologist will do a more thorough check-up on your vision. An optician is just going to give you glasses.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thought I would post an update because people were kind enough to show an interest.</p>
<p>The optician concluded I &lsquo;exhibit an exophoria&rsquo; in my left eye.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophoria">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophoria</a></p>
<p>She prescribed a &lsquo;prismatic&rsquo; lens to bring the eye back into line, but I have to wait to see an opthalmologist to confirm the exact prescription. I&rsquo;m a bit frustrated but nevertheless it is something that seems correctable.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your advice!</p>
