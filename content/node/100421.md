  Style most closely resembles that in the attached jpeg.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Monotype
  Italian Old Style available digitally looks nothing like it. Lanston's does, but
  it lacks small caps and old style figures.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the guidance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ital_4056.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, JW.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity: how is it that a digital face called
    \"Monotype Italian Old Style\" would bear no resemblance to a hot metal face named
    \"Monotype Italian Old Style\"?"

  body: Out of the many different type sizes of the original hot metal version they
    chose one size (probably for phototype setting) that is by reproduction not the
    same as the originally printed in text size on coated paper. Plus the recreation
    of old faces for phototype usually was a bit sloppy, due to enormous time limits.

  body: It goes way beyond just type weight - the W is different than the one shown
    in the sample in Goudy's Type Designs (complete) by Frederick W. Goudy. Other
    glyphs appear to be altered as well, such as the shape of the dots on i and j
    etc.

    are some notable diffences to the scan from the Monotype metal version though,
    e.g. the width of the W, which probably had to be narrowed to fit the Monotype
    unit system."
