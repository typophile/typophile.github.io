  like \"c. 1748\" in English typography? \r\n\r\nI\u2019m talking about British English,
  Akzidenz Grotesk font, InDesign, and \"c\" is italicized. The editor suggests no
  spacing at all, which looks odd to me (but I\u2019m German, so what do I know) and
  gives me trouble with the large amount of space around Akzidenz Grotesk\u2019s figure
  \"1\" (that is, \"c.1077\" and \"c.908\" look wildly different in spacing when set
  without any space at all).\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me know about your take on
  this.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If I understand correctly, you're running into a problem with tabular figures.
    The numerals in most fonts all have the same width to facilitate lining them up
    in tabular columns. This creates spacing problems when the numerals are used within
    blocks of text \u2014 especially where there's a 1 involved \u2014 where proportional
    spacing would work better. If it were me, I'd just adjust the spacing so that
    it looked right.\r\n\r\nAs for whether or not there should be a space between
    the c. and the date or whether or not the c. should be italicized, I'm not sure
    what is most common in British English, but I suspect that it's more a matter
    of style than anything. I'd need to check the Chicago Manual of Style or the Associated
    Press Styleguide, but in the U.S., I think the most common style is to <i>not</i>
    italicize the c. and to place a space between it and the date that follows. Again,
    though, it really doesn't matter as long as you're consistent about it."

  body: "The typeface matters here. I would set c. in italics if it were a serifed
    face with a nice italic \u2014 but not in Akzidenz Grotesk. Either way, you need
    a space after the c. (American English), at least in running text, and if possible
    in tables etc as well."

  body: "Thanks a lot for all your comments!\r\n\r\n@riccard0 \r\nOptical kerning
    is a possibility. Still it looks strange to me, put so close together. At least
    it would be consistently close this way \u2026\r\n\r\n@Thylacine \r\nI think manual
    spacing will not be possible, but InDesign\u2019s optical kerning might do it
    well enough. I\u2019m also feeling that some kind of spacing is the most common.
    I\u2019m gonna ask the editor whether he\u2019s following some guideline. Consistency
    within one book is the most important thing, true, but consistency in all books
    of the same language doesn\u2019t sound too bad, either. (Just me, dreaming.)\r\n\r\n@Michel
    Boyer \r\nNow \u2026 that\u2019s the fourth way of doing it. Thanks a lot for
    letting me know about you finding!\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn\r\nThanks for your advise.
    Actually my options are scarce in this situation since the design was decided
    upon before I came into play with this project \u2026\r\n\r\n@Joshua Langman\r\nWell,
    yes \u2026 but most editors don\u2019t care about typefaces or looks.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end I have settled with this: With just the \"c\" italicized it looks odd,
    but with the \".\" italicized, too, there is a tiny little more room between the
    \".\" and the first number of the year, maybe comparable to a hair space in InDesign.
    I will do it this way because if later somebody else works with the document he/she
    might not understand a GREP style of optical kerning just for \"1\", so this is
    simple and good enough for this messed up situation."

    case adjusting it in order to make it behave a little better in running text.\r\nThen
    I would insert a punctuation space, or a thinner one, between the period and the
    |1|.\r\nBut I\u2019m no expert on British style-guides either."

    editor is probably using a style guide which calls for no space. You might be
    able to insert a tiny space, but my experience has been that the project manager
    usually follows the editor's advice in these things."

    at the end of a line.\r\nIn InDesign there are 2 varieties, the better one (sorry,
    the one I prefer\u2026) has Fixed Width \u2014 you may have to define a keyboard
