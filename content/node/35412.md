body: I have been set with the task of designing a logo for a sporting goods company
  and was wondering what font says what the title of the thread says.  "Font that
  asserts confidence and is sporty too."  Copperplate Gothic was an initial suggestion
  because an emblem using "Engraver Old English Font was being used.  Is there another
  font that would be better suited for asserting confidence and sporty too?

  body: "Is this a diversified sporting goods company or do they specialize in one
    or a few particular sports?\r\n\r\nEurostile light extended would work, in my
    opinion, well suited to sleek, high-end products of an indeterminate nature. It
    is a very conservative choice and something much more radical might be appropriate
    given more information."

  body: "Oh! I see. Branding a store is entirely different from branding the products
    that fill it (though it is not unrelated).\r\n\r\nNaturally you have to consider
    the sort of customers you're seeking, how to differentiate your client from their
    competitors, and finally what would look good in many low-quality reproduction
    methods, from building signage to flexo print on plastic bags.\r\n\r\nCopperplate
    Gothic certainly has an air of confidence about it, in a very conservative, bankerly
    kind of way. Not sporty at all, in my opinion. If your client's heart is set on
    it, I suggest offering [[http://www.typodermic.com/32.html|Typodermic's Biondi]]
    as an incermentally more modern alternative that will stand up to those low-quality
    reproduction processes much better."

  body: A low contrast sans like Futura or Gill Sans might work with Copperplate Gothic
    titles. Interstate might be good too, but I would not suggest Helvetica in this
    instance.

  body: But let me be clear, I'm not much of a sports person in general, so I'm not
    an authority on this, but the selection of Copperplate Gothic and Engravers Old
    English seems very "country club"-ish as far as sportyness goes. Golf, tennis,
    yachting, polo, that sort of thing. Sporty? Perhaps, but not at all active and
    youth-oriented. These are faces I associate more with "security" than "confidence".

    it might be used as part of a corporate id it is more likely to be seen in a more
    sedentary arena than sporting goods, especially if linked to a blackletter emblem.
    I would look at sans (or possibly slab) faces, avoiding swashy script with a banner

    and the full width is more so than the condensed. Do you have any lighter Futura
