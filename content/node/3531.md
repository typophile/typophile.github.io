  body: ' Soren -- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I understand your first question. Insignia&#39;s
    &#39;A&#39; serif goes to the left. This is not all that uncommon &#40;though
    not usually so pronounced&#41;. One could probably trace the origins of this treatment
    &#40;although a different style, to be sure&#41; back to some medieval calligraphic
    forms. <BR> <BR>But &#39;A&#39;s that have a single serif to the right are going
    to be hard to find. Goudy did a couple designs that might qualify. Goudy&#39;s
    National Oldstyle has an unusual seriffy movement to the right. This face was
    based on lettering he did for National Biscuit Company &#40;Nabisco&#41; around
    1900. Goudy&#39;s Pabst Oldstyle also shows a similar flourish. <BR> <BR>-- K. '
