  body: I don&#39;t have a specific ID for that, but, according to the Rob Roy Kelly
    book &#40;American Wood Types&#41;, that general style was known as Concave Tuscan.
    Also, a lot of wood types didn&#39;t actually have names, only numbers.

  body: Nick Curtis has a selection of wooden types at <a href="http://www.nicksfonts.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.nicksfonts.com/</a>, but none are very close to your
    sample. I also looked through the Solotype Catalog, to at least find a name, but
    this typeface only resembles a few types that were all upper case and more elongated.
    The other problem is that not much of the Solotype collection was digitized. The
    rights to the collection now belongs to Castcraft, so they claim.

  body: Thanks for the information. Is it in your opinion a typeface that belongs
    to the Solotype collection? Is there maybe a website of Castcraft?

  body: Donald,  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t see an exact match for this in the Solotype
    book. Castcraft site starts at <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/" target="_blank">http://www.castcraft-software.com/</a>.
    It may take some hunting to find the information that they acquired the rights
    to Solotype. I have heard that inquiries to them may never be answered, so I can&#39;t
    give you a very positive feeling about dealing with them. Frankly, I think you
    would be best off just searching for Wood types, Tuscan types or Western types
    and seeing what is available. The closest resemblance to this I know is a font
    from the old FontBank colelction called Old West. It is an open face style, but
    I think it could be called concave tuscan too. You can see and buy it <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/oldwest.htm"

    Woodentype Fonts</a> too, if the site ever comes back <BR>online. I visited it
    just last week; hopefully it will return. The fellow had <BR>several Tuscans,
    although I don&#39;t recall if any matched your sample <BR>image.
