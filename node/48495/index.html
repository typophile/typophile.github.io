	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Saad, Aziz,

I had a quick glance at this product. In short, Aziz's claim that this is straightforward OpenType with no need for additional technology is not correct. 

1. Applications
The Maryamsoft dowload contains an installer that sets up an application directory with executables and fonts. This is proprietary technology.

2. System DLLs
In the Windows System directory Maryamsoft replaces the essential 397Kb usp10.dll, the OpenType layout engine, with a 500Kb modified version. This replacement usp10.dll no longer calls the original Microsoft GDI32.dll, the Graphical Device Interface, but instead a newly installed proprietary GDX32.dll. As a result, Microsoft Windows is turned into proprietary technology.

3. Fonts
The fonts have no OpenType layout tables, but instead use non-standard tables. This could be considered proprietary technology.
The underlying artwork is impressive and authentic, but the outlines as such appear not not to be the work of professional type designers.
As for the font structure, the glyphs are a mixture of letter parts, complete letters and ligatures.

4. Unicode compliance
The concept uses assigned and reserved Unicode character code points for markup as a kind of proprietary technology. As a result these alien Unicode characters interfere with the text structure and data interchange. Moreover, font changes becomes impossible with such texts.
According to the CMAP, language coverage is limited to Arabic and Persian. And, BTW, the OS/2 table is empty. 

5. Uninstalling
The package contains an unstaller utility. It restores the original usp10.dll. However, on all the paths leading to MS Office applications it leaves a trail of copies of the proprietary 500Kb usp10.dll. As a result, there is no de facto uninstallation for MS Office, since these applications will keep encountering the proprietary layout engines before reaching the real one. It requires a manual removal. The replacement graphical device manager, GDX32.dll also needs to be removed manually.

More to be discovered later. Now off for dinner. After all, there is no such a thing as a free lunch.

Thank you so much for this detailed technical analysis and review of MirEmad software.  This was exactly the sort of information I was looking for when I asked Aziz if there was an Arabic or English translation of the site or the product brochure.

Unicode compatibility is essential today, I hope they will work out that issue.

0. Aziz’s claim that this is straightforward OpenType
with no need for additional technology is not correct. 
... the Software deeply penetrates into the Windows system. 
1. MirEmad sets up an application directory with exes + fonts. 

What is incorrect in what I claimed?!
MirEmad is a system-correcting+integrating tool plus
OpenTypes fonts that appear Straightforward in Font-Lists 
but not in Windows Fonts Folder. No additional Software is needed.

2. Windows DLLs are ineffecient/insufficient to handle Arabic fonts.
That's why we redeveloped them.

3. ... Font outlines not the work of professional type designers.
Admittedly true for the earlier versions of MirEmad.
In the coming fonts like Reyhan, no ripples are seen.

4. Unicode compliance
4a... alien Unicode characters interfere with the text structure and 
data interchange.

Envitable trade-off. You gain nothing for nothing.
However, we built - for our own use - a smart searching engine
that skip those aligning characters.

4b. Moreover, font changes becomes impossible with such texts.
Changes made to such texts can be canceled in part or whole 
simply by pressing Alt+F5.

4c. According to the CMAP, language coverage is limited to Arabic and Persian. And, BTW, the OS/2 table is empty.

You see it half-empty, we see it half-full?!

5. Uninstalling
Your recommendations will be thankfully worked out for the coming versions.

John Hudson,

@ Replacing a key system resource such as Uniscribe with a custom version
seems to me a very bad idea. 

Good or bad is yet to be proven.

@ Does the MirEmad version replicate all the APIs of the original Uniscribe?
If not, it will be be breaking other apps, scripts or fonts.

MirEmad causes no conflict + no malfunctioning to any application.
Nothing was taken away, but essential additions were made.
So far, no body complained with its installation +/or its removal.

Flowers to All.

In other words and for all clarity, this software deeply penetrates into the Windows system.

When a third party "redevelops", i.e. hacks, other companies' copyright-proteced and licensed software on systems whose owners aren't even asked to consent with the change, this is considered software piracy. The resulting illegal functionality is called a virus.

Regarding ignoring Unicode compliance:

"Inevitable trade-off. You gain nothing for nothing."

It would be honest to warn your potential customers and stop suggesting that MirEmad is regular openType for which "no additional Software is needed", because it needs not just special software, but it even "corrects" the Operating System.

		<div class="commentbody">To put it in the context, this is how things are in Iran. No resident in Iran has ever purchased a legal software in his life! Hacking illegally obtained softwares and adjusting them to Persian use is 'le monnaie courant'. There is some protection for internal products in internal market but that's about it. Open Source environment users naturally have a more legitimacy.
In fairness, I should note that this is a systemic problem creating a large cultural deficiency in terms of respect of copyright laws. But I do know of individuals who fully understand how harmful it was for developing Persian support in applications and even tried to purchase legal products, although they are very hard to come-by and many times more expensive. But this is an exercise in futility.

1. Different countries have different Laws, so please:
a. do not force yours on us as we do not force ours on you. 
b. feel free to hack MirEmad. Reciprocally?!

2. Did we make any aggression to any other language?

Thank you for the eccentric proposal to breach each others intellectual property rights. There is however absolutely no need for this, as we are fully confident with our own original analysis, technology and designs.

The more I learn about Persia and Iraq, the more I am moved by the profundity of their civilizations. It is a privilege and a pleasure to work on Arabic script in general and Nastaliq in particular.

Let's agree that we are both advocates for respectful and honest treatment Arabic script.

I just discoverd an example that it's not just Microsoft whose ideas are "improved".

A quick comparison with
http://www.axissoftmedia.com/ 

and this
http://www.fontworld.com/me/tasmeem.html

shows that even creative phraseology (like "uncompromising Arabic" before) can be hijacked. 

Anyway, it serves to prove that in Iran, Pakistan and India there is an intense interest to preserve Nastaliq, the greatest of all styles, for use on the computing platforms.

A dream come true!

It isn't even in Iran and outside the boundaries of International laws. How could it be?
If it is any consolation, that product won't fly in Iran. Urdu nata'liq has its own specifics which is different from Persian nasta'liq. It might not be decipherable to the non native eyes though.
Now to end this consolation, you should wait for another 'improved' product of yours, this time with Persian nasta'liq!!!
But you could see it coming couldn't you?!
Anyhow the sooner you put your ACE everywhere and feed people with their basic needs, the lesser appetite for stealing sophisticated calligraphic applications.
As they say, if you can't kill them, feed them!

Speaking of basic ACE, could you explain a bit about justification mechanism and its interaction with other text engines and font formats, and particularly other scripts? And how about antialiasing in basic ACE?

I'm sure it's not only my curiosity. There are people in Iran and Pakistan waiting for answers!!!

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Behnam,

It wasn't hurt, but rather surprised that this Indian company copied our wording verbatim. Apparently this is  case of a different sense of creativiy and self-respect.

We developed an admiration for and deep interest in Middle Eastern script culture - and try to contribute something useful. We never saw it coming that this would put us in the position of literally or metaphorically having to "kill or feed" people who do not respect other than their own property rights. It makes me want to return to the days that I was only interested in dead languages.

As for the different regional variants of nastaliq, it is an interesting challenge to identify and parametrize the features that distinguish Persian, Ottoman and Urdu nastaliq on the level of script grammar, i.e., competence. The chunky forms, odd proportions and deranged alignment of what led to the likes of Noori Nastaliq and in turn its derivatives, I consider a less relevant dimension, something on the level of execution or performance. From feedback on our own work, I get the strong impression that Urdu users can appreciate the equivalent of a Persian level of performance as long as the competence behind it meets their conventions.

Regarding Decotype ACE, there is no need to speak of "other" font formats: for our technology the font format is irrelevant. Today it uses regular OpenType fonts, so any thing on font level, including anti-aliasing falls into that domain. The key difference is ACE as the lay-out engine. It takes the form of an API. Once this is built in, our script output can be made to interact seamlessly with any other engines or scripts. As for justification, that's again in the host engine's domain. The proof of concept is of course Tasmeem, which is capable of handling a lot more languages and scripts than the regular version of IDME. You can download and test it yourself.

I agree with you that there is a need to make our technology widely affordable. We understand the urgency and are actively working on a solution . It's unfortunate that the present situation leads to copying and hacking, but in the end of the day it is a compliment.

The post to which you refer is a nice reminder that you have not understood Milo's replies back then. As he pointed out there, ACE/Tasmeem <em>do not</em> follow the usual spacing + kerning method, it uses a different method for defining spaces between letters and words.

ACE is literally the embodiment of the recognition that "Arabic is a dynamic script" so possibly you tell Milo old news. And ACE's above-mentioned different approach to spacing, by the way, is just logical consequence of this recognition.
<em>ad 1</em> -- This may be true in the context of usual spacing + kerning method. But as said, ACE uses another method. Hence, a mere debater's point.
<em>ad 2:</em> -- <a href="http://typophile.com/node/48495#comment-331016">Your example</a> above indicates that with MirEmad, words are composed by pulling every individual piece to its proper place manually. Now this is what I would call "impractical (time-consuming + tedious)". ACE/Tasmeem does all of this automatically, so you <em>can</em> do manual adjustments if you feel like it but you <em>do not need to</em>.

You are argueing against your own misunderstandings and ascribe to ACE the problems that MirEmad seems to have. I have a hard time to make sense of this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Above example was carried out with the 2-years old TTFont of Nastaliq just to demo the power of MireEmad in moving letters up+down, right+left by selecting them + pressing Alt + arrow keys. That font has been rebuilt (not released yet) with zero-spaces (automatic kerning) between letters and minimized spaces between words to be widened manually when necessary.

In One word, MirEmad does automatic kering for both Typographical + Calligraphical fonts. And it does automatic word spacing for Typographical fonts like Adobe Arabic. But manual word spacing for calligraphical fonts like Rayhan.

@ Tasmeem uses a different method for defining spaces between letters and words.

1. How does Tasmeem define spaces between Letters? By example please.
2. How does Tasmeem define spaces between Words? By example please.
3. Putting aside the unhappy ligatures, mark-positioning, Kerning and Word-spacing, of page 5/7 from http://www.fontworld.com/mepdf/Tasmeem4.pdf is messy. Why?!

Aziz, I know that Microsoft licenses different customized versions of usp10.dll. May be you should approach it that way.  Even better, you should have a separate dll(s), with different name(s), to handle the functionality of the ones you "hacked". Adobe Indesign ME uses its own replacement of usp10.dll, it seems, and leaves MS usp10.dll alone.  This I think is the best way.

		<div class="commentbody">I have some [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniscribe|good news]] for the originator of this thread.

His font is not the first piece of software to modify Windows, and replace its existing copy of the file usp10.dll with another version. <em>Microsoft Office</em> does the same thing, according to the Wikipedia article I linked to.

A third-party update to support Malayalam is also noted.

A virus is a piece of software that copies itself to other computers, and so that term, at least, does not apply here. There could be legal implications, and there could be a danger of making other software not work right (if I already installed the custom version of the DLL that lets me work with Malayalam, that would certainly break, but I imagine that this is an unlikely scenario).

Note that some software that uses alternate versions of a DLL installs with that DLL in the software's own directory, so possibly putting the DLL in the directory of the (executable of) the word processor to be used with the font would be a better alternative - I don't know offhand under what conditions one can substitute a DLL in this way, but I do know that many software packages that come with their own versions of DLLs (a version from Microsoft being the particular update the software requires - many DLLs are redistributable) do such a thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell|Here]] is an article on the basic technical issue that is faced here; at one point, this was a major problem with Windows, back in the days of Windows 3.1, when DLLs were normally always shared among all applications.

Customizing usp10.dll, however, does seem to be a common practice for those wishing to work with exotic scripts; it is noted that one needs to download a special version to work with Khmer in some of my search results.

This is what comes of designing Unicode so that it is not tied to glyphs - and expecting the most sophisticated software support for the languages which are much less widely used than Arabic, languages like Khmer, Malayalam, Thai, and Burmese.

Microsoft releases the internals of usp10.dll to developers under an NDA, but it isn't updating it itself to widen its language support. It's a pity that Microsoft probably wouldn't be amenable to a project to write, using no Microsoft code, an OpenUSP, that not only included the features you use for Arabic, but the extra features many other world languages require - and which Microsoft itself does not have the resources to support.

It would be somewhat ironic for part of Windows to be based on open-source software - although nothing new, as it does, as the world learned some time back, use chunks of BSD Unix.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah. I did not read all the posts carefully, and the statement that "a flying boat is used in place of the Microsoft bridge" is one that I would not have accurately interpreted without help.

Some of my search results had pointed out that usp10.dll is <em>itself</em> out of date. Given how it was distributed, one would think it was there to give Microsoft Word an advantage over its competition, so this puzzles me.</div>
