  body: "looks like a custom job to me, based on the following:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CNAingles_definitivopantones_6380.jpg]\r\n\r\nspecs
    state \"obligatory white wire\" which to me is not included in the text. and\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CNAingles_definitivo_6200.jpg]\r\n\r\nwhich
    appears to be modified lettering for the C. note the strange/inconsistent curve
    at the inside bottom. \r\n\r\nfonts like Futura, Avant Garde, etc may have characters
    close enough for you to manipulate for a similar look."

    total lack of optical compensation (for example the points of the \"N\" not projecting
    beyond the bounds).\r\n\r\nBTW, fresh out of the oven:\r\nhttp://typography.net/fontfamilies/view/42\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
