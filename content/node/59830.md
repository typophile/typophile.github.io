  7.0]], our HTML/CSS to PDF converter, with lots of new features that I have been
  eager to share with the Typophile community. Some of the highlights include:\r\n\r\n
  - Support for OpenType fonts with CFF/PostScript outlines.\r\n - Kerning and ligatures
  using OpenType layout features (GSUB).\r\n - Mark and cursive positioning using
  OpenType layout features (GPOS).\r\n - Shaping for Arabic and most Indic scripts
  (Devanagari, Bengali, etc.)\r\n - Experimental support for applying arbitrary OpenType
  features.\r\n - Improved font support on MacOS X and Windows.\r\n\r\nAs you can
  see, we have really been focusing on fonts and i18n for this release, so I was wondering
  if any Typophile members might like to try it out with their favourite fonts and
  scripts. We would greatly appreciate any feedback on how we could make Prince even
  better!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n"
