body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nIn the the last days I'm working in a new design. The inspiration
  is in the aesthetics of machines an in the geometric typefaces used in CAD softwares.
  In the project I tried a friendly-eye approach through proportions, spacing (no
  manospaced) and optic adjustments in the weight of the lines.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rafaelneder.com/discord/\r\n\r\nPlease
  tell me what you guys think"

  body: "Hello, after a long pause I`m back. In the past weeks I fix some drawings
    on several glyphs and change some proportions. \r\n\r\nTo the family I'm planning
    some ligatures and alternates but this is my first OpenType adventure and I'm
    having a lot of pain in the generation of the font files but i will fix it soon.

  body: "I don't know if is just me, but the letters don't seem to have the same baseline.
    I know that the 't' and the 'l' don't, but i the word 'behind' i have a odd feeling.
    My guess is that the bottom of 'b' 'e' and 'd' are hinted and the h' 'i' and 'n'
    aren't. The metrics of 'f' and 'r' leave a big white area and the metrics of 't'
    and 'l' are too small. A good example is the word 'software'.\r\nAnother thing,
    your diacritics seem a little out of place, like the \xC2, \xD4, \xDB, and the
    ~ looks to wide for the lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nEmiliano Amadei"

    body: "Hi Emiliano,\r\n\r\nwell all the letters have the same baseline and only
      /t and /l have have an optical adjustment because of the end of the strokes.\r\n\r\nI
      agree with you about the metrics of /f /l and /t in the whole picture they are
      to wide, but to me the /r problem stills on the drawing. The arm are to big
      and the negative space blow up."

  body: "Could you post a new pdf of what you have now?\r\nWhat i was saying about
    the baseline is that when a letter like your 'i' 'h' and 'r' that begins with
    a vertical stroke and no support at the base, it tends, when rendered, to look
    smaller and bolder when compared to a complex form ghyph like 's' or 'a'. With
    a little hinting you can solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmiliano Amadei"
