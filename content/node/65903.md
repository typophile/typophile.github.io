  body: Apart from the need to sort out the spacing, I think that Art Deco style in
    the first one matches the vintage microphone better than the chopped slab serif
    in the other two, plus it works a bit better with the condensed sans. I think
    you only need the single mic image, but try moving everything down a bit so you
    have more margin at the top and lose the big blank area at the bottom. I don't
    think the "7 to 9 Pacific time" is a very good way to list the time.

  body: "I'm liking the improvements, but the text beside the microphone needs some
    contrast adjustments in my opinion. You can make lines of type stand out in two
    ways: make it bold or make it big. In this case, you've got bold type competing
    with bigger type, and the eye doesn't know which information to read first. I
    would personally make the \"1st Sunday of every month\" type the same size as
    the address, both to keep sizes consistent throughout the poster and also to let
    the bold \"A free monthly...\" stand out and attract the eye like it should. I
    would also spell out \"First\" instead of use the \"1\", but that could be just
    personal preference.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I like the alignment you've chosen
    for the text. It helps keep things looking simple and professional, and I think
    it's a great font choice for the headline, as long as that's the feel you want
    the poster to convey. (You're likely going to get more jazz musicians interested
    in this than rock musicians.)"

    musicians. i think this is for stand up poets.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stanza_4390.jpg]"

  body: "Ah, poets, that makes much more sense. I like it a lot better. Looks good,
    but the \"First Sunday...\" text gets kinda lost between the large, bold lines
    now. I think making \"7-9PM\" the same size as the \"First Sunday...\" text would
    help that. Not a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it anyway. (Us typography
    people can be really nit-picky!)\r\n\r\nNice work!"

  body: 'I like your progress and considering the fact that you''re new to type, etc,
    its not bad. The point size overall can be scaled down I think. I''m never a fan
    of photoshop filters, however I think it works with the nostalgic feel. The ultralight
    type gets a bit distracting when placed next to the linear elements of that mic
    and when placed between the bolded faces. You''re using all caps as- maybe as
    a resolution, experiment with creating that hierarchy with lower and all caps.
    Good that you got rid of the greyed back rules coming in from the side... But
    yes, I''d say, scale something back, there''s too much competition right now between
    the three element: the display, the subtext and the imagery. Let them work together.
    Oh and alt+right and left keys for tracking and kerning. '

  body: I would give a little more air above the mic. And I'm still not sure that
    the posterized style of the image goes very well along the sharpness of the type.
