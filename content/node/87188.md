  Falcon? I'm looking for the script font in this image. I know it's vintage; I'd
  be happy with something close.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maltese credits_5835.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/maltese

  body: Surely handwritten. The image didn't show up, so it's difficult to suggest
    alternatives.

  body: OK, I edited my post, so hopefully the image shows up now. I don't work in
    design and don't know much about this stuff, but I thought that it might be handwritten.
    I would like to use it for my business cards and blog. Anyone have suggestions
    of something close?

  body: When you say script, do you mean you want something similar to the connected
    script in the bottom left picture? That reminds me of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/|Metroscript]].

  body: Do a search for the common freebie Blackadder. It's definitely not a pretty
    font, but it has lots in common with that titling.

    I was hoping to go, but I appreciate your time.
