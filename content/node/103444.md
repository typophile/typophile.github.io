body: Now that I am building a lot of fonts on my computer, does anyone have a great
  idea how to organize them for easy access when designing? Rather than looking at
  the sample text in the design programs? I started my own typographic display--but
  it doesn't stay alphabetical as I keep adding new fonts....and it has become pages
  long, and time consuming to create.
