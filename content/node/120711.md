  body: "I share the opinion of Fivos that this is probably hand made.\r\nThe lettering
    is in French, so I suspect a French design as the source. Peignot is one possibility,
    but I see it's competitor Roger Excoffon's Chambord of 1946 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChambordExcoffonOlive1946SM_3841.jpg]\r\nas
    more probable, particularly if the width is expanded to 110%. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChambordExcoffonOlive1946SMWidth110pct_3701.jpg]\r\nChambord
    was quite common in post WW II France, including signage for the railroad system.\r\nDon"
