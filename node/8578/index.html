<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Ok ladies and gents, here's my problem. <br> <br>I'm trying to get started in designing typefaces. A lot of the designers and artists I talk to can direct me to the use of type in design, but never about the true to form, design of a typeface. <br> <br>With that in mind, where is a good place to start? (Besides reading everything that is posted here, which I try my hardest to do.) <br> <br>Any good books that you recommend that you've read? There's a glut of information out there, and I tend to not trust any old amazon.com review or back cover description online. <br> <br>I would appreciate the help.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Alessandro, <br> <br>I was hoping that I could get a more revised list, or rec on what to start with. While I don't doubt those are great books, there has to be a few that are best to start off with... <br> <br>thank you for the link though, as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mr. Rob Mizell, <br>sorry, feel free to use that list as you like of course <br>because I just copied & pasted the excerpt from my bib. <br>I don't feel any specific question from you, why do you <br>like different letterforms? What job do you do? <br>I started with Neville Brody's 'The Graphic language of <br>N.B.' but that is my story. I am 28. <br>Thank you Mr. John Hudson, I didn't know those books. <br> <br>Best, <br>AS</div>

<div class=commentbody>you bring up a good point... <br> <br>I'm a student right now. I love typography (obviously or I wouldn't be here.) Designing a type face appears to be a daunting task at this point, but is something I'd love to accomplish. Having a background in newspapers and communications has me in love with the functionality of any typeface. <br> <br>I just don't know where to start. I didn't know if there were books or other tools that gave a walk through on type design or if there are certain standards a typeface should possess. <br> <br>Hopefully that is a clearer explaination than my original post...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would add to what has already been listed Robert Bringhurst's <i>Elements of Typographic Style</i> (which is not specifically about type design, but is still very helpful) and <i>Type By Design</i> for when you are ready to start working in Fontographer or FontLab. <br> <br>The books Mr. Hudson lists are excellent and highly recommended.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would suggest an exercise: something less daunting than designing a whole new typeface from scratch, but which will teach you a number of useful things. Find an existing typeface and make an adaptation of it for a specific purpose, e.g. a newspaper version of a traditional book face, or a headline version of a text face, or a lighter or heavier version of a face. This is only an excercise, of course, and you won't end up with anything sellable (unless you want to offer it to the owner of the original font), but I think you can learn a lot in this way. Also, if you are ever interested in getting a job in type design, you are likely to find this sort of work to be among the things you are asked to do.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In preference to <i>Type by design</i>, which is both out of print and also too Fontographer-centric to be an optimal help with up to date tools, I recommend Leslie Cabarga's <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1581804369><i>Logo Font & Lettering Bible</i></a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0965762858><i>Learn FontLab Fast</i></a><i>.</i></div>

<div class=commentbody>I would recommend two places to start, both of which reduce the sheer number of design parameters to be dealt with. <br> <br>1. A casual face (eg Fontesque, which was my first digital font). You don't have to worry about conforming to what the "proper " character forms are and how they fit together -- sophisticated cultural/technical nuances which are a big hurdle to start with. At the same time, you do have to find a way to get your casual shapes to combine -- but you have some leeway. Drawing and scanning is a good place to start , because one expresses oneself authentically in the drawn form. <br> <br>2. A monoline "techno" face (eg Matt Desmond's new Variable). Basically a stroked path. This means that considerations of weighting (contrast, stress, and joint thinning) are not an issue. And being condensed, fit and proportional width are simplified. Techno construction is also a good place to start, because the way one focuses on the basic capabilities of the vector tools is also authentic, "true to materials", when the tool is Illustrator/Fontographer/FontLab.</div>
