  forum and the typowiki for the answer. If I have overlooked the answer I apologize,
  but would very much appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.)\r\n\r\nAs
  I understand it fonts are not generally considered copyrighted, but there names
  can be trademarked as a form of protection.\r\n\r\nIf this is true how many or in
  which countries should I trademark my font?\r\n\r\nAlso I have designed the font
  in the UK. will it be subject to copyright here? Is there any additional steps I
  need to take to secure copyright?\r\n\r\n"
