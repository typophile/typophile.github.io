  \ It was being used on in-store signage for the season.  I have not been able to
  locate it since.\r\n\r\nThe image is of the most unique characters from the display.
  \ Any assistance you can offer would be great!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nBill[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jollies_3961.jpg]"

    but I'm not aware of a digital version...
