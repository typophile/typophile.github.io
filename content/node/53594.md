  hair products, so the design should be represent this kind of beauty care.\r\n\r\nHere
  is my first attempt:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/honlapterv_01_3847.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's
  just the headline. I'd like to use that specific design of the offical logo on the
  whole website. But I really have a difficult situation here. I like the girl with
  the red hair, but she doesn't fill the whole space. Resizing her won't solve the
  problem, because this size fits the best on the headline. And looks the best of
  course.\r\n\r\nSo, I keep thinking about what to use to fill that space on her left
  side. \r\nSome ideas? Please share!"

  body: "I see...but still don't get how this would help to fit that empty space on
    the headline. Some of my friend suggested me to keep it that way, and put nothing
    there. But I kind of feel it's unfinished. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the site is
    already finished, so I don't need to design those parts anymore. My only problem
    left is the headline, and to be more specific, that empty space on the headline.\r\n\r\nSo
    I'd like to get suggestions, ideas for that part of the work only. Thanks a lot!
    :)"

    look out of place and overdesigned.

  body: I'm not really sure what you refer to when you say "the headline". What empty
    space?

  body: "When I say headline, I mean the whole picture I inserted here. So the website
    continues, I just didn't feel the need to put it all here. Just the top side of
    it. In this case the headline means the girl, the logo, and the empty, white space
    between the two.\r\n\r\nSo my problem is that white space. It feels kind of empty
    for me and I don't know what to put there.\r\n\r\nI hope I could explain it well
    enough. :)"
