  I (usually working on Mac) want to check what screen type (like on a website) looks
  like on Windows, is it fine/enough to run Windows in emulation (like in Parallels)?
  Or are there deeper hardware issues that make the output still different on dedicated
  hardware / a stand-alone Windows system? (I'm not sure what Parallels does regarding
  monitor gamma, for instance.)"

    You could always try browser shots, or Boot Camp.

    I use quite extensively BTW) exactly misleading, at least in the finer details,
    because they don't factor in system-side things like monitor alpha? \r\nI could
    see that Boot Camp should be pretty much 1:1 to a Windows machine. I'm just not
    entirely sure if any rendering differences might remain that are due to system
    architecture etc?"

    at all stupid, I did the same sort of double take when I did this. I then took
    my schizoid mac to a second, windows-only, windows machine to confirm, granted
    through the lens of a different screen, that it is the OS causing the rendering
    differences.\r\n\r\nSo, the answer is that what you're seeing looks like windows
    running on the same kind of screen as the Mac. And <em>all</em> the rendering
    differences that remain are due to \"system architecture etc.\", and also preferences,
    as I understand your question. \r\n\r\nSo you could also look at your site with
    all kinds of preference changes to see what that does to your site(s).\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    for the explanation. I'll continue playing around with Parallels, and (more or
    less) believe what it shows me. :)"
