    Century Light Italic</a>.

  body: By the way, I think it's likely that the first two are not off-the-shelf fonts,
    but some sort of custom work or customized fonts.

    we got these images from led us to believe that both these typefaces belongs to
    a family!\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else can enlighten us to the nature of these letters?\r\nPerhaps
    they have been tailored from another typeface?"

  body: "RE: Formsclub\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your response:\r\nPretty much on
    par with <em>Tiffany Medium Italic</em> \r\nEven the beginning arm in the counter
    looks like its just been reversed & tweaked a little! However, can anyone recommend
    another typeface similar to Tiffany where the serifs are  like the ones in sample(2)?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    at ITC Century Light Italic -- anything but the \"R\" is pretty much the same."
