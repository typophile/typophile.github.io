- body: "My first impression was the logo was a cross between Tina Turner and a seahorse.
    \ Oh - wait, no, it's cross between little Maggie Simpson and a poodle! \r\n\r\nIt's
    like the ink splot a shrink shows you ... what does that say about me? Am I crazy?\r\n\r\nok,
    ok, some real feedback?  The logotype isn't very readable; perhaps give it some
    air to breath?  I gotta say, I don't see jeans, here, even expensive ones.  The
    logotype to me seems like a law firm for snowboarders, but the logo is more fun
    and edgy. I think the logo could benefit from some simplification, however. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    try a more raw, curvy font like: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typo5/fashyon/\r\n\r\nAK\r\n\r\n"

    the hundreds of free fonts there are out their like it) I seriously think I'm
    going to kill myself. That style is on ever current punkish/emo band right now
    and every product line designed for that demographic.\r\n\r\nIt's like a horrific
    experience they won't let you forget!"

- body: "Just for the record - I never said I liked it; but it works for the demographic.
    \ I've learned the hard way that obvious works - for a reason. \r\n\r\nYou can
    use a leaf to communicate \"environmental\" and reach 90% of your target market
    on first glance, or you can be creative, smart, and witty -- and only reach other
    creative, smart and witty people.  The brand name \"Lobotomy Divine\" doesn't
    exactly scream individuality.   \r\n\r\nSelling jeans is all about selling image,
    and if the target market is young women who want to look like Jennifer Anniston
    in a pair of jeans, well, then, you need to use what speaks to them.  \r\n\r\nAlso,
    just for the record, I may be painfully out of touch ... what the heck is an emo
    band? \r\n\r\nAK"

  body: ">> well, then, you need to use what speaks to them. \r\nI get that... \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the link,\r\nI liked Fashyon, It can be used without the logo - it's pretty
    pure slash logotitle typeface. \r\n\r\nbut together i hardly see any connection
    between them... \r\nWhen both of elements are same quality, you loose the overall
    impact, i think. I think there should be a dominant one... i chose the seahorse
    (also called Hippocampus) shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nThings sound
    better in black."

  body: "I can't help but see a man's profile in the negative space on the right side
    of the seahorse/Tina Turner/Lisa Simpson shape.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of \"young
    female\" clothing, I think of Limited, Too (http://www.limitedtoo.com/) or abercrombie
    kids (http://www.abercrombiekids.com/kids/index.html). \r\n\r\nMy advice is to
    keep it very simple, but with a fun twist to it. Young girls don't care about
    the logo on the label (as evident by Limited, Too's outdated monstrosity - no
    offense to the designer, of course) - but they DO care about the name, so it has
    to suite the targeted customer. I'm not sure if \"Lobotomy Divine\" would attract
    a 12 year old shopper - or even more importantly, it might deter any parent shoppers.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Also, the red/white and typeface look very gothic and angry to me. It might also
    have to do with points on the seahorse...looks like a sawblade"
