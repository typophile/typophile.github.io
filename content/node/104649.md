  body: "I have never coded for InDesign, and I can't answer the question you are
    asking.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I would just recode the input text (before feeding
    it to InDesign). But first, are you sure your input never contains a sequence
    like \"shin shidot qamats dagesh\" (for instance \u05D4\u05B7\u05E9\u05B8\u05BC\u05C1\u05DE\u05B7\u05D9\u05B4\u05DD)
    that you would want to replace by \"shin dagesh shindot qamats\"? If so, the substitution
    \"[letter][nikkud][dagesh]\" to \"[letter][dagesh][nikkud]\" is not general enough.
    You need to accept [nikkud]+, i.e. one or more.\r\n\r\nIf your input file is already
    utf-8 encoded, then the following Python code should do it (provided there is
    no cantillation mark between the letter and the dagesh). \r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\n----
    file reorddag.py ---- cut line\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nimport re, sys\r\nreord
    = re.compile(ur'([\\u05D0-\\u05EA])([\\u05B0-\\u05BB\\u05BD\\u05BF\\u05C1\\u05C2\\u05C7]+)\\u05BC')\r\n\r\nif
    len(sys.argv) > 1:\r\n   f=open(sys.argv[1])\r\nelse:\r\n   f=sys.stdin\r\n\r\nline
    = f.readline().decode('utf-8')\r\nwhile line:\r\n  print re.sub(reord, ur'\\1\\u05BC\\2',line).encode('utf-8'),\r\n
    \ line = f.readline().decode('utf-8')\r\n---- cut line\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf you you
    save those lines to <code>reorddag.py</code>, then\r\n<PRE>\r\npython reorddag.py
    input.txt > output.txt\r\n</PRE>\r\nshould perform the desired changes; if you
    are on a mac or linux, you can name the file reorddag, make it executable and
    it can be used with <code>reorddag input.txt</code> to get the output on stdout
    and it can also be piped.\r\n\r\n-- 16 Jul 2013 \u2014 11:51am Added # that was
    missing before ! in the copy, on the first line \r\n-- Something weird is happening:
    \ starting on my mac with shin shindot qamats dagesh in \u05D4\u05B7\u05E9\u05B8\u05BC\u05C1\u05DE\u05B7\u05D9\u05B4\u05DD,
    copying it  to typophile  and then copying from typophile to my mac I end with
    the sequence shin qamats dagesh shindot.\r\n-- 17 Jul 2013 \u2014 3:35pm Added
    a missing comma at the end of the print line (was giving two CR for each line)"
