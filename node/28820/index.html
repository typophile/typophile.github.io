  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completing my research regarding corporate typography - especially custom creations <a href="http://typophile.com/node/27315">http://typophile.com/node/27315</a> - and I was amazed that the same fonts come up all the time as branding tools.</p>
<p>You know them - Helvetica, Univers, Frutiger, Futura, Myriad and the classic gothics (Trade, News, Franklin, &hellip;) - used in close to half the cases.</p>
<p>I asked a few graphic designers who work in branding why these same choices for very different companies and markets. Here are the main reasons: “I don&rsquo;t know where to learn about new fonts” and “I don&rsquo;t have the time or the care to browse around the internet.”</p>
<p>My suggestion is that a newsletter - an email one that is - be created to advertise these new fonts. People could subscribe for free and font distributors would only pay a few dollars to show these new fonts. Simple technology, a name, a visual, a price and a where to buy. Better yet if it could be multilingual.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your opinion on this?</p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t almost every foundry (big and small alike) released a newsletter? If we could get an edition of those newsletters to specifically be about faces that are corp id-friendly, now that&rsquo;s different.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If we choose to specialize in the corp id niche (catering to branding/account planning agencies), I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be a good idea.</p>
<p>Heck, why don&rsquo;t we become type consultants of some sorts? A lot of designers talk about type selection, house style guides and the likes &ndash; all the time. Then there&rsquo;s the problem of unifying it across the border (print, web, TV, outdoor, etc.), while deciding on a face that would fit &ldquo;just right&rdquo; without resorting to the safe alternatives is already hard enough for them.</p>
<p>Typographic consultancy that extends beyond simply distributing web newsletters, I think that has some potential. Think Fontsmith, but without the foundry.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think a newsletter of this sort would be difficult to put together, because it really has to be independent. But even the MyFonts.com newsletters, which try to represent the broadest possible sources, are edited selections of new fonts—not all new fonts are featured, and sales rank seems to have a lot to do with choice. Although Laurence does write great copy for it.</p>
<p>Typeface selection, even for branding and corporate identity, is still a very subjective matter. How does one make an objective newsletter about it that treats all interested parties fairly? Who writes it, and what is the source that it comes from? A &ldquo;Typophile Newsletter&rdquo; would be brilliant, because this site has credibility.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Coincidence or not? I am in the process of establishing a typographic consultancy — and one of it’s purposes is advising on fonts for CI’s.</p>
<p>I think that the enormous scope of available fonts makes it near impossible for designers and art directors to keep up to date. Ergo the anticipated need for a single source consultant.</p>
<p>I have a name, I have most of the resources in place, financing, a lot of knowledge (I think), but what I think I still need is some help, mostly on a free–lance basis, with possibly the chance for these collaborators to take my concept to other (geographical) markets.</p>
<p>It’s an experiment in some ways, I know, but I am quite hopeful it’s gonna be a feasible concept. 
I’ll keep you informed. (Please feel free to contact me about this.)</p>

<p>About the blog – newsletter dichotomy, I&rsquo;m wondering if we can be somewhere in the middle and have a &ldquo;face/family of the day&rdquo; kind of e-mail? Instead of doing a weekly letter where we pick 5-7 fonts, we&rsquo;ll pick one each day and do an in depth review (and show some real world usage, CI people love to see practices and examples).</p>
<p>Maybe this is a great idea after all. Any collaborators want to do it, too :) ?</p>

I have learned so much from all of you, and have found new favorites that I am saving up to buy (some of Stefan&rsquo;s beautiful creations). While I do love Univers and those other standards, it is wonderful to see how other typographers are interpreting letterforms.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have been itching to re-launch TypeReview.com and was thinking about some of these very issues.</p>
<p>What if one could go to a web site that had a database of fonts and view the data in a variety of ways including RSS feeds <em>and</em> email newsletters. For example, one could register on the site and specify what categories of fonts were of interest, then receive a daily or weekly email listing new releases in just those categories. The listings would include a link back to the site for more information (such as ratings/reviews) and a link directly to the foundry or other appropriate vendor for purchase.</p>
<p>The real trick would be populating such a database and making the effort to include as many foundries/designers as possible.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this approach?</p>

<p>This is why most of the font newsletters sent out each month are already coming from foundries. They have a direct desire—they want to promote their releases (not anyone else&rsquo;s…)—and they pay to do it, in terms of time and money, etc. It brings them positive returns.</p>
<p>If you make an independent newsletter, financing can get touchy, as people sometimes attach conditions to their advertising, etc.</p>

<p>On a wholly different note, what about <em>The Onion</em> of the typographic scene. Fun stuff, that. And I&rsquo;m sure Chris Lozos would very much like to join the team :)</p>

<p>Of course, one would not get rich in this way, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily what it&rsquo;s all about. I suspect one could make enough to pay for the time and bother, as well as the basic expenses.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the motivation for a designer to read a newsletter knowing that foundries can pay for top billing? We already see their ads in magazines, get their bulk mail, and their emails.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to subscribe to a font mailing list, it needs to feature great fonts that are slipping through all the noise generated by advertising. Otherwise it just isn&rsquo;t going to offer anything new.</p>

<p>Ok so the rule is that when you post a news item (story) you need to e-mail (contact) a moderator so we can publish it. But still, this is a very easy way to let anyone who subscribes to the Typophile RSS know that you&rsquo;ve released something new.</p>
<p>Just a note, when you do post a story, the more you can write the better it will look and the more likely you will get people at least going to your site to see the typefaces.</p>
