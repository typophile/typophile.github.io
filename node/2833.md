    it has been modified a bit here and there, as logos often are. I don&#39;t believe
    that this typeface has made the leap to digital. It was very popular in the &#39;60s

  body: The Coffee Bean logo resembles a Bookman variant from the late &#39;60s or
    early &#39;70s called Meola Bookman with Swash, but the only specimens I can find
    are neither bold or italic &#40;in other words, only regular roman&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I strongly suspect custom lettering. Or perhaps the logo has been redrawn
    enough times over the years that it no longer matches the original typeface it
    was based on.

  body: My question is still the same, that font was popular when I was getting into
    the industry and fell out of favor until now, why now? I never loved it then and
    don&#39;t love it now. Its too easy for non-designers to  abuse the swashes. It
    seems once a week at MyFonts someone is asking about it.

  body: My theory is that people with little experience with type tend to find such
    fonts easier to distinguish from &#34;normal&#34; fonts. When they want something
    to have a &#34;special&#34; look, they tend toward fonts that are obviously &#34;special&#34;
    in some way. No room for subtlety or refinement at that level of awareness. It&#39;s
    sort of like the difference between picking &#34;red&#34; and picking &#34;Pantone
    214.&#34;

  body: Good point Mark, do you think its because anyone who has a PC can now call
    themselves a designer if they get type? Which leads me to ask where are the type
    designers heading towards the masses on PCs or towards educated designers. Because
    if it for the former I&#39;m afraid more Bookman Swash Italics will be developed
    rather than elegant faces like Neutraface. <BR>

  body: Mark has a very good point, and the key phrase in his comment is &#39;level
    of awareness&#39;.  As people become more informed and less impressed by flashiness,
    perhaps such attention getters may not impress the new desktop graphics folks,
    but I wonder if their customers will ever have that sort of savvy?  I have been
    hanging out doing font ID&#39;s in newsgroups and forums for over 3 years and
    I can almost count the number of times people asked about text type on my fingers.
    &#40;This forum has a better percentage of those &#39;clients&#39; I&#39;d say&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>In my opinion &#39;newness&#39; &#40;even if it&#39;s old fonts being revived&#41;
    is what attracts the font collectors and users. To me that&#39;s what is a bit
    funny about Neutraface as a font fad. There&#39;s nothing radical, or inventive,
    about it, just like there wasn&#39;t with Chalet, but House does such a nifty
    marketing job, that they make everyone want it.  I agree with you Dan that is
    has an elegance, but so did the designs that it imitates.  <BR> <BR>You know the
    line about how &#39;history repeats itself&#39;? It&#39;s true in fashion and
    in fonts too. Art Deco and Retro fonts appear to be in vogue, and this is a great
    time to revive them. Fonts like Bauhaus and Eurostile and their conceptual offspring
    seem to be timeless, in that they manage to keep looking &#39;new&#39;. Part of
    that is because many people don&#39;t know the history, so they begin to repeat
    it, thinking they have discovered something. I tend to think that&#39;s they way
    it will always go, just like the way skirt lengths and colors change with the
    trends, but rarely really discover anything new. <BR> <BR>One person&#39;s idea
    of font sophistication may be only as good as the uses the font is put to. If
    it&#39;s the right choice, you look like a true artist, if it isn&#39;t you are
    one of the masses just playing with fonts. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s my bit of font
    philosophy for today.

    It may not be as widespread as <i>the humanist sans outbreak</i> of the 90&#39;s,
    but one need only look at a Veer catalogue to see the incredible number of retro
    brush scripts and swashy &#42;new&#42; designs. Perhaps it has something to do

    <BR> <BR>I have a specimen book which contains a section titled &#34;A Flair for

  body: This is really funny. I was just gonna say that University Roman already has
    built-in swashes. It&#39;s such an OTT font isn&#39;t it.

    a flare font for University Roman. Don&#39;t tell me they made a flare font for
    courier.

    You don&#39;t only want to do the minimum, do you? Brian, over there, is wearing
    37 pieces of flair. 15 is the minimum, but some people choose to wear more, and
    we encourage that. Mmmkay?&#34;'

    are all gone. All those little broken images; Typophilie used to have smiley graphics
    and not anymore. How very sad.
