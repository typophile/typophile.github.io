    target='_blank'>Schneidler</a> (I adore his 'k'). My guess is the URW medium weight.

  body: So far, I've got <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/aeneas/' target='_blank'>Aeneas
    Light</a> for the 'M' - but it's not perfect.

  body: Ok so it turns out that the M is a different font to the rest. No wonder I
    was struggling. If anyone can tell me what the M is then that would be me sorted!

    for your help.

  body: "Nicely done, Angela.\r\n\r\nDamn. With those splayed legs that widened toward
    the bottom, one of the first fonts I thought of was <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/koch-antiqua/'
    target='_blank'>Koch Antiqua</a>. Outside Rudolph Koch's home country of Germany,
    the font was known in the rest of Europe as, yep, Locarno - the inspiration for
    Alan Meeks' Locarno. Most of his fonts were (splendid) manipulations of prior
    typefaces."
