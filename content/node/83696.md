    praising R for having most of the elements needed: stem, bowl, and tail.'

  body: "The obscure fellow typophile might not have meant one particular letter which
    all the others stemming from. I guess, he was rather talking about \u201Cwhen
    you see one letter you can reconstruct the whole alphabet\u201D.\r\nI\u2019ve
    never tried myself but it might be some kind of typophile sportsmanship to spot
    just one (or five or seven \u2026) letters af a typeface on any artefact \u2013
    and go designing the whole alphabet.\r\n\r\nCould be a nice competitive exercise,
    actually."

    R synopsizes the rest of the alphabet in a single character\" --exactly what i
    was searching for.    Thank you kindly! \r\n\r\n"
