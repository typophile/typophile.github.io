  foundry takes to develop a new face. And those that have done it before ( without
  the foundry ), I would also appreciate your input.  \r\n\r\nLets say, on just a
  basic set. U&lc + numbers, italic U&lc + numbers.\r\n\r\nI've given myself approximately
  1 year (part time) to do mine, I just need some kind of guage.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    those as well as small caps, old style figures, ligatures, swash caps maybe, and

    They are going to work on the whole family simultaneously. Nowadays, that includes

    development time inside of a foundry is right at about two years for the family.

  body: "There's a difference between finishing a font [enough] to sell to users,
    versus demonstrating type design affinity -via a font- to a prospective employer.
    In the latter case, completeness is relevant only to the extent that it facilitates
    evaluation of your skills. So for example instead of spending X days to finish
    the smallcaps, it's smarter to spend part of that time doing <strong>some</strong>
    of the smallcaps and the rest of that time maybe showing good sensitivity towards
    extended-Latin accent placement. Now, you do want to totally finish the alphanumerics,
    and punctuation, and you do want to deliver finished base spacing, but you might
    forsake fully kerning UC-UC pairs for example, in favor of maybe showing your
    hinting or OpenType abilities, or making a prototype display/text cut of your
    base design, or maybe a smaller optical size, etc.\r\n\r\nSo the question -a really
    interesting and useful one- becomes:\r\nWhat are the discrete affinities that
    a type designer needs to have/show?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    yes \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 go to Typecon; meet people. maybe you can start

  body: "<em>Finished enough (well done enough) it could get me a job outside of cincinnati</em>\r\n\r\nEric,
    sorry about my above comment. I was just responding to your first post and not
    your second. Of course, everything that Hrant just mentioned above is correct.
    To show off of typeface, you just need to make it look good in whatever your desired
    environment/application is.\r\n\r\nTo get a job, it might be good to show that
    you know things that are of interest to a specific foundry. This will of course
    vary from foundry to foundry. But OpenType subsitutions are pretty much being
    done everywhere, so that can't hurt.\r\n\r\nAre you coming to TypeCon? The best
    way to meet people and make contacts is, in my experience, at conferences. Conferences
    + Typophile is an unbeatable combination.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    New York almost 4 years ago from Cincinnati and many avenues that were once closed
    to me opened once I got out of that city. For example, I'm going to TypeCon (which
    others have already suggested) the fact that I live in New York makes TypeCon
    a subway ride away from me. That is something that would not have been possible
    had I stayed in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nBased on some things I've seen you mention

  body: Eric, in terms of time to develop and design a type just let me insert a bit
    of historical stuff - Frederic Goudy designed, and in some cases cut the matrixes
    (matrii?) for 116 types in 48 years, so that is a bit more than 2 per year. Considering
    the complex job of matrix cutting, that constitutes a lot of work. These designs
    do include separate roman and italic types for such as Goudy Old Style, Garamont,
    etc. I suspect that Goudy worked quickly and was, of course, a man driven by type.
    This probably doesn't answer your question directly but might give you some perspective.
    And yes, a font is never really finished.
