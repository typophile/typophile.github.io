  Lead</a>. The first one is a little light and breezy, but I plan to get into a lot
  more detail about what we're doing with the Google Font API, open source fonts,
  performance, rendering, font technology, and more. Please subscribe and wait for
  updates.\r\n\r\nWe had a great launch, and I'm still recovering a bit from all the
  excitement - and definitely looking forward to relaxing a bit this holiday wekeend.
  Again, thanks to everyone here at Typophile for supporting the effort in many different
  ways."

  body: "Raph, best of luck with the blog, but what's with the revisionist history,
    or perhaps a bit too much champagne during the post launch research? \r\n\r\n>The
    first web fonts actually shipped in December 1994 (Netscape 4.0 shipped with support
    for the proprietary PFR format). \r\n\r\n>Internet Explorer has had support for
    its own flavor of web fonts since IE6, \r\n\r\nIE 4 first supported EOT (not IE6),
    and Netscape wasn't even called Netscape until late 1994, Netscape 4 shipped a
    few years later than that (June 97 according to Wikipedia). There was no FONT
    tag until 1995 and IE.\r\n\r\n\"light and breezy\" indeed :-)\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"
