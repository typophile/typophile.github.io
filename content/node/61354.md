    and some lead type, but unfortunately we haven't found a place to have it up and
    running yet, so so far it is just stored.\r\n\r\nHans Ivar"

    to hear more about letterpress shops in Europe. \r\nI know that the revival is
    pretty strong in the US, but the large part has been driven by the Vandercook
    hand press, for invitations and small press work, rather than commercial letterpress.\r\n\r\nBTW,
