  body: Alex, to me and to others, it's plain to see that the font you linked to above
    is a crude autotraced version of the P22 Vincent font that Mike linked to initially.
    If this is not the first time that you have linked to poor quality font imitations,
    this would likely be the reason you were accused of being a 'ripoff-spammer'.
