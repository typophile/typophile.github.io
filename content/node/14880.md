  and <a href='http://www.identikalshop.com/'>Identikal</a> but I'm having no luck.\r\n\r\nNot
  big houses, like Adobe, Linotype, etc...\r\n\r\nI really appreciate how Process
  Type displays their information - I can get a good idea what I'm dealing with from
  their site.\r\n\r\nAnything else out there on the horizon?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how
  I could do an effective search in the forums to do this otherwise...\r\n\r\n(We
  could exclude Emigre, Fountain, Garage Fonts, House Industries as I've already been
  through them.)"

    found via this site.  This isn't merely about free fonts (you normally get what
    you pay for)...\r\n\r\n<a href='http://fontleech.com/'>Font Leech</a>\r\n\r\nVia
    this site I found <a href='http://cape-arcona.com/'>Cape Arcona</a> which has
    some quite nice stuff that fits with what we're thinking about."

    (just launched)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ourtype.com\">OurType</a> (Flash at its

    It's all links to my distributors. I guess I should read the nodes better before
    making comments.\r\n\r\nCheers"
