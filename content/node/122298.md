body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GNR_logo_6091.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe company logo
  appears to have two fonts based on the tail of the \"R\" and the variation in stroke
  appears. Uncertain if the ampersand has been manipulated or not, cannot find this
  symbol. \r\n\r\nAny assistance in identifying these fonts would be helpful. The
  logos the company have on file are low resolution.  "

    ampersand looks to be Sabon (also artificially condensed), but could also be Garamond
    Extra Narrow:\r\nwww.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/garamond/\r\n\r\nSabon
    and Garamond are also likely candidates for the balance of the name and for |FINANCIAL
    GROUP, INC.|, but both have a capital |P| in which there is a gap between the
    bowl and the vertical stroke, and I\u2019m not seeing that gap in your artwork
    (at least not in the main name).\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your deductions. \r\n\r\nThere is a gap on the company sign
    on the P's in |FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.| though with the poor resolution and pixelation
    on the graphics the company has on file, I can see why this is lost. \r\n\r\nThank
    you again, I shall try my best to replicate this logo so I can have a vector version
    for manipulation. Cheers!"
