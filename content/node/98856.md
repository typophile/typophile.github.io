  body: Also avoid the end of the year because fonts released then will not be considered
    for annual lists, which are compiled earlier.

    themselves gifts for Xmas?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>February and March</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot
    in the US. Taxes!\r\n\r\nI think the best time to release is... right now. The
    earlier it hits the ground the sooner it will make more money for you. And you
    can start worrying about your next one.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
