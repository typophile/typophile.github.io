  body: "Preface: I'm a very green type designer.\r\nIn the simplest case, you go
    about it something like this:\r\n\r\nGet the idea.\r\nDraft forever.\r\nCreate
    outlines.\r\nWork on kerning.\r\nTest.\r\nGo back and kern some more.\r\nRepeat
    the last two or three (or four or five) steps until you're feeling good with it.\r\n\r\nIt
    depends on the approach from here; some designers will create different weights
    at this point either by manipulating the outlines already drawn, or by starting
    over from the top. Depending on the complexity of an accompanying italic face,
    it also likely starts from the top down. Many times a single face is all that's
    produced."

  body: "I would suggest that, in between \"create outlines\" and \"Work on kerning,\"
    you add \"Refine metrics.\" Although \"best practice\" suggests that sidebearings
    should be equalized, sometimes it can be counterproductive to do so.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/detail1_4622.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    always make at least one pass (and, often, several passes) through every possible
    combination of uppercase+uppercase, uppercase+lowercase and lowercase+lowercase
    \ letters to set my metrics. Good (that is, practical) character spacing can eliminate
    the need for a lot of kerning later on."
