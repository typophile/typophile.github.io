  body: "What do you want to know? \r\n\r\nThere are several Van Stockum bookstores
    in and near the city I live; they are quite reliable and I see no problem in ordering
    from them.\r\n\r\nAs I live in The Netherlands, I can't tell you anything about
    the quality, speed and cost of their shipments to foreign customers, but I can
    tell you that the books they've imported from other countries (Germany, France)
    for me, are relatively cheap and arrive in reasonable time. English books, however,
    are usually cheaper through Amazon and the like."
