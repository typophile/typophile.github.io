  always thought these examples would be more useful if- since they do them so periodically,they
  had some kind of print option so that you can print out and build up a little book
  of all their type. Printing the page takes 3 pages and includes all of the unimportant
  as well. I could just copy and past a bunch of stuff or use screenshots, but that
  becomes too cumbersome.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n"

    most of their booklets are images with a little type at the end.\r\n\r\nI guess
    i could always just exacto out the type pages and bind them togethar myself....
    runs off to start frankenstein type project.\r\n\r\nBut still i think it would
    be nice, useful, and better for veer if they made it easy to make a booklet out
    of their type emails. I mean it would be a lot easier to find cool type of theirs
    if i could print it out and look at it on my whim. \r\n\r\nIn fact they could
    just use css to set a seperate design for the print of those pages. They could
    just hide all the html stuff they don't need and include just the type. Not that
    hard really."

  body: "Oops... a little late to the discussion here... let me catch up.\r\n\r\n<strong>@
    Jesse</strong> - It's certainly possible to provide a more print-compatible version
    of the email, but it would take resources that we just don't have at the moment.
    Like you mention, the simplest way to do this would be to provide an alternate
    style sheet specifically for print that strips out all of the superfluous marketing
    pap and leaves the tidy type specimens. Since the email campaigns are designed
    to work with rich content email clients and webmail interfaces - I have specifically
    designed the HTML formatting of the campaigns to look good in those contexts.
    Your point is well taken, and perhaps I can do something in the future to improve
    the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@ Jonathan</strong> - If you didn't receive
    the latest Activity Book, <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0002063\">we
    have them available</a> for a very reasonable price in our merch store. The previous
    year's issues are still available as well. [<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0002042\">2005</a>
    | <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0002004\">2004</a>]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@
    Ken</strong> - <em>\" I tend to consider the email updates as spam.\"</em> That's
    unfortunate, but I can understand why you might feel that way. If you like, I
    can remove you from our email marketing list only. Let me know. Heck, since you're
    here in town... stop by in person.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@ Yves & Stefan</strong>
    - You have both nattered away at me about this before, and I know it's frustrating
    - to me as well. Again, it's a question of resources, but we are working on getting
    a more substantial marketing presence across the pond. Once we get a better grasp
    on how to get printed pieces into Europe efficiently, you'll have many more lovely
    bits of paper in your mailboxes, I promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@ Si</strong> -
    I just looked into the information we have on file for you. There's no email address
    associated with your account, so you would never have received any of those missives
    from us. I think the reason that you have not received any printed pieces is because
    you were marked as a prospective customer without any account activity since 2003.
    Basically, you're account isn't filtered, but it's not exciting enough for our
    mailing list guys to want to send you something on a regular basis. I've given
    your account a bit of a 'nudge' in the database, so something should arrive within
    the next few weeks. Otherwise, I could add your email to the account in the meantime.
    Contact me via email if you like to change your preferences.\r\n\r\nI think I
    need to pay for the next cab ride.\r\n\r\nWhew."

    scripts book. \r\n\r\nGreat resources. Grant, how often do you come out with new

    up with your email type update campain instead of doing the css print option."

    vs the type freaks - at least in my expereince. However, the needling is both
    deserved and appreciated.\r\n\r\n<strong>@ Jesse</strong> We do have several of
    those (2+ year old !!!) type books available. Send me an email privately, and
    I'll see what I can do to quench the thirsty crowd. We have two new books coming
    out this year... one <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0002058\">features
    the Umbrella collection</a>, and the other (which should be mailed this fall)
    features the Jukebox library. Both will be included in the TypeCon goodie bag
    this year - for those fortunate to be attending the festivities in Boston.\r\n\r\nI
    am fighting to have more type-specific print pieces produces at Veer. Next year
    is looking promising for more of those specimen books, but they are extremely
    labour (and creative) intensive to produce. One idea we are trying to get kick-started
    is a monthly typeface postcard mailer... that would be something to sync up with
    the email missives. We'll have to see if that happens."
