      small text on a aircraft fuselage - hence the curvatures, i think. \r\n\r\nthanks

    i don't know - but the letters sure seem pretty uniform to have been \"set\" and
    not drawn.\r\n:D\r\n\r\n/tb"

  body: "<cite>the photo is from a relatively small text on a aircraft fuselage</cite>\r\nwhy
    would that make it unlikely? much of the old military stuff was either stenciled
    or hand lettered. this is definitely not stenciled. anyway, as Steven said, each
    character instance is unique, however slight it might be to someone who's not
    looking for it."

  body: Ditto. A font may have been used as a model. But there is too much screwy
    distortion to be a font, imo also. Like the two eSSes in STATES. The two As in
    AEROBATIC. In fact that whole word. Maybe if you post the context of the whole
    photo the distortion could be explained, but I don't know how.
