  browsing font stores on the web. \r\nIf I look at these fonts and draw them free
  hand with just a pencil and paper, am I infringing on the font's copyright? \r\nI
  plan on selling the finished piece I create. \r\n\r\nI am NOT printing the font
  and tracing over it. I am NOT tracing over an image of the font in Illustrator.
  \r\nHowever, I AM looking at the font and free-hand drawing it. \r\n\r\nOnce I'm
  finished looking at the font and free-hand drawing it (NOT TRACING), it looks very
  similar but IS NOT an exact copy. \r\nI feel my hand drawn version of the font is
  not an exact copy but does closely mimic the original font. \r\nAgain, I AM NOT
  TRACING, I am free-hand drawing while looking at the font to imperfectly replicate
  it.\r\n\r\nI'm just starting out hand lettering, can anyone help steer me in the
  right direction? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Is it European or American? The laws differ. Another one: is it protected by Design
    Patent in the US? Some fonts are.\r\nThere just aren't any general answers."

    For a bit more artist integrity and to help further your own understanding and
    skill, it would make sense for you to use that as a start, but embellish upon
    it so the the piece of finished lettering doesn't end up looking like a mediocre
    drawing of a font. If it's a well known font you should consider going even further
    in your interpretation as anyone would easily realize its a copy. \r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking its considered OK for people to mimic another person's work for learning
    purposes, but not to copy and display as their own. Doing this with a published
    font falls somewhere slightly out of that parameter, but is probably within legal
    limits."

  body: "Mark, why not just license the font. As an artist you understand the effort
    that goes into creating a work like this. The license fee (say $10 to $30) seems
    reasonable if you plan to profit from the font, even if it's not legally required?
    \ This is more of an ethical question rather than a legal question, no?\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si"
