		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Hrant that it's very iterative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That being said, the most important thing is to try to finalize the spacing before getting into kerning. If you mess with the spacing much after you get into kerning, you will likely need to throw out all your kerning and start over again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're working in PostScript style outlines, there's no reason not to hint your glyphs as you're working on them. If you're working with TrueType outlines, you pretty much have to leave hinting to absolute dead last. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other than that, it's a matter of taste and preference. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, working with PS outlines, I complete a handful of glyphs, and while I'm working on them I space and hint them. I then test them together and fix the spacing some more. Then I continue to expand the glyph complement (hinting all the while), periodically stopping and refining the spacing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The typeface I'm working on right now I have tweaked the spacing too much, so I will be tossing out the moderate amount of kerning I already did and starting over.

I do agree, if this is what you are getting at, that some scripts require extensive kerning to achieve acceptable basic spacing, i.e. that kerning is not always 'exceptions' to basic spacing as it usually is in Latin fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">It comes down to the near-requirement of avoiding touching: you want the words to set tightly, but scripts that have letters with a lot of lateral &quot;protrusions&quot; will collide a lot (with kerning off). You can either set everything loose and use a ton of negative pairs to correct, or you can set everything with &quot;natural&quot; tightness and use some positive pairs to remove collisions. Which way you go depends on a number of things, like the degree of collision in the script, the intended user base of the font, but also the amount of time/effort you want/can_afford_to put into the design.  And this last consideration isn't limited to lazy/cheap people like me. :-) The MS core fonts have too-dark Bolds basically because it would have been ridiculous* to hint every single stem to snap wider to two pixels. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Both in effort and resultant file size - note that about 50% of the file of an MS core font is the hinting!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me give a real example: Armenian has a fair amount of &quot;collision potential&quot; (mostly in the descenders). You can tame the protrusions, but that's culturally and functionally (think boumas) bad - although you still do it a little bit (in the same way that a &quot;g&quot; in a [good] Latin text face needs to look slightly cramped). To save myself having to set everything loose and then tighten with a ton of pairs, I went the other way. With 546 pairs* I got really good texture. My estimate of how many pairs would have been required with the other (non-kern-reliant) method is 3-4000, so a lot more work. With kerning off, this kern-reliant method will produce some collisions when set without kerning, but: it will also produce better &quot;x-band&quot; spacing; people with kerning off aren't likely to mind some touching anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Tellingly (although not surprisingly) about half of the pairs were positive - very unlike the typical Latin font. BTW, Mana uses some reliance on positive pairs too - this allows it to be tight (unlike Verdana for example). Over 1/3-rd of Mana's pairs are positive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; application of kerning should be part of the language <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; shaping engine, not something turned on by the user. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But in practice the user -and the app- end up sharing the responsability.

You're presenting incorrect speculation as fact (again). Given a well-hinted TrueType font in the first place, it is literally a single line of code that accomplishes this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any superhinted TT font, one is controlling when the stems change from one thickness to the next, at least for most of the lower levels (one, two, three pixels thick). This is especially necessary when there's a matching italic, since one needs to make sure they break at the same ppem sizes for those lower levels. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words, the &quot;additonal&quot; work involved and font size added, rounded to the nearest whole number as a percentage, is zero. (Though of course if one had already done the detailed hinting and then changed the stem widths, that would entail more work. But like spacing vs. kerning, that's not the order one does these tasks in.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I were to speculate, I'd *guess* that the reason the bolds are so heavy for those fonts is to keep them more WYSIWYG between what they look like at typical screen sizes and what they look like in print. But that would be just speculation, though with a little more basis. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is somehow comforting. I think I had agreed with the last half dozen posts of Hrant's that I had read. I was wondering if it was a sign of the apocalypse or something.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That aside, I do understand and agree with Hrant's comments about different scripts needing a different spacing vs. kerning strategy.

Which has the effect of making the screen font more WYSIWYG relative to the outline font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the broader sense, Hrant is right, and that's what Vinnie was saying: the closer the outlines are to the desired bitmap pattern, the easier it is to achieve that look with hinting. It's just that the *particular* issue of weight is one that is trivially easy to adjust with hinting. Well, in TrueType, anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Note: Type 1 and PostScript flavored OpenType have a concept called &quot;force bold&quot; which accomplishes some of the same goals, in a cruder but even easier way.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A follow-up question: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can believe that making a Bold's outlines snap [wider] to two pixels is simply a matter of setting a threshold  (as opposed to tediously hinting every glyph), but: if this applies only to stems (and not arches for example) is it possible that this would create an imbalance in a glyph's rendering, like in fact sometimes introducing stroke contrast? Especially in a monoweight* font like Verdana. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* As a side question: is that a good term, or is &quot;monoline&quot; better? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in hinting terms, &quot;stems&quot; are both horizontal and vertical &quot;corridors&quot; of node alignment. You can control the thresholds when PPMs switch to 2, 3, 4 etc. pixels for both horizontal and vertical stems, separately. So you can control the stroke contrast, and keep it linear. As for arches, you cannot hint them explicitly &ndash; all Type 1 hints and most TrueType instructions work in either horizontal or vertical direction only (there is some diagonal control in TTH).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You say &quot;setting a threshold (as opposed to tediously hinting every glyph)&quot;. Stem control does not occur OPPOSED to hinting, it IS hinting. In fact, it is the fundament of any hinting &ndash; you always start with the font-wide parameters (that go into the control value table &quot;cvt&quot; and the font preprogram &quot;prep&quot;).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only after you've reasonably set the font-wide hinting parameters such as stems and alignment zones, you start with per-glyph hinting, since instructing individual glyphs is basically fixing and fine-tuning what the font-wide hinting has achieved.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
