body: Hello <BR>I&#39;m trying to put together an identity for my freelance work that
  emphasizes a non-corporate, entertainment-oriented focus. I want to use a 1930s
  or 40s-era diner as a metaphor for the promotional materials. <BR>What do you think
  of this logo? &#40;I don&#39;t have a color palette in mind yet.&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks,

  body: I like the idea of cooking/serving good &#40;tasty&#41; design, Troy. But
    I am not sure if those quite rigid letters correspond to the very dinamic figure
    of a cook/waiter. <BR> <BR>Maybe you should try to keep this 30s-like composition,
    but combine it with a more contemporary font. It could communicate meaning like
    &#34;contemporary design served in a 30s manner&#34;.

    fonts.  When I saw your initial logo I thought of their font &#34;Sign Painter&#34;.  I
    don&#39;t currently own the font, but here is a screen preview I pulled from the
    site.   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21955.jpg" alt="">

  body: Would it be more interesting &#40;successful&#41; if you could get the design
    to imply there being a circle, instead of actually using a circle? Right now,
    the shapes almost seem squooshed into the shape. I really like that pig. Perhaps
    you need to use a less decorative typeface for the word design?

  body: pig?  haha...it&#39;s a chef, right?  and that&#39;s his apron tied in the
    back, right?  &#40;not a curly pig tail&#41;  i think his raised leg needs to
    be a little longer and maybe not curving up so much. <BR> <BR>i agree with tiffany
    wardle though, that the big circle takes away focus on the wonderful little guy.  maybe
    avoid the circle and have &#39;design&#39; going horizontal. <BR> <BR>also, i
    think TASTY looks mis-scaled.  try evening out the curve over the tops of the
    letters.  make the second T smaller i think, and maybe move the Y left a bit....or
    do completely different tries with other fonts.  you gotta do 20 to get 1.

  body: haha. oh man! I saw a pig! Now I see the chef. I am so sorry. His hat needs
    to be articulated, or maybe do a little more research and find a different shape.
    I did read the hat as the snout, and his nose and the ear, and the tied apron
    as the curly tail. I&#39;m embarassed, but this should tell you something. And,
    I don&#39;t know that it reading &#40;secondarily&#41; as a pig is such a bad
    thing. Hehe! <BR>

  body: Troy ... as Daniel has discovered your use of a dingbat, I would highly suggest
    even more modification than you have already done. What if the apron was blowing
    behing him a bit? And you might also want to change the chef&#39;s hat to the
    more traditional one, or rather the one that most people identify with chefs.
    Perhaps more of a round nose and less of a carrot stick. Just suggestions.

  body: Thanks for the comments and suggestions. I will post another few possibilities
    soon. <BR> <BR>My illustration was based on a piece of clip art I found in one
    of Dover&#39;s books -- which apparently was also the basis for the dingbat. I
    am curious about the issue of incorporating illustration work done by someone
    else -- do you think there&#39;s something wrong with that? Obviously it&#39;s
    in the public domain so I&#39;m not stealing anything from anyone. Is there any
    difference between that and using another person&#39;s typeface design &#40;which
    this is&#41;? <BR>Is it just because it&#39;s a logo? I see designs &#40;including
    logos&#41; all the time that obviously incorporate old artwork. &#40;Art Chantry&#39;s
    work comes to mind.&#41; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mean to argue with you, I sincerely
    am interested in what you think. <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s better for me to explore
    type-only solutions &#40;especially if the chef looks like a pig --ha!&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Troy

  body: 'Troy, it is probably legal to use a &#34;prefabricated&#34; ilustration.
    The problem is that you do not have exclusive rights to use it., so your neighbour
    may use the very same ilustration in his logo some day. In such a case you could
    have a tough time telling your clients that you &#34;serve&#34; original design
    done exclusively for them... '

  body: 'I think there was a miscommunication ... but Matjaz makes <BR>the point that
    Tiffany meant to make, I think, about the <BR>distinctiveness factor. <BR> <BR>Just
    taking that a step further. It isn&#39;t &#42;probably&#42; legal, <BR>it&#39;s
    legal legal legal. <BR> <BR>I think the word &#34;discovered&#34; made it sound
    like you had <BR>done something wrong, which clearly, you didn&#39;t and <BR>clearly
    that wasn&#39;t Tiffany&#39;s intention. <BR> <BR>All that said ... <BR> <BR>I
    looked at your original intentions &#40;non-corporate, entertainment focus&#41;
    <BR>and the Retro 30s look, imo, is not your strongest direction. <BR> <BR>The
    Tasty type treatment is problematic because the <BR>T and Y are rendered so small
    in comparison to the  <BR>other letters. I do enjoy the letterforms themselves.
    <BR> <BR>And the logo could just as well be for a caterer or cake designer. <BR>
    <BR>The word &#34;Tasty&#34; is not the easiest thing to illustrate ... <BR> <BR>Sometimes
    the solution just comes from sketching or <BR>fiddling in Illustrator. When it
    doesn&#39;t come right away, <BR>one thing that I&#39;ve found works is to try
    to pour out <BR>26 solutions or 26 ideas in 26 minutes.  <BR>The 26 can be thought
    of as arbitrary guide, but if you <BR>get stuck, the specific letter can be an
    ideation catalyst. <BR> <BR>These can be quick sketches or just words: waiter
    with serving tray. <BR> <BR>From those ideas, take a handful of your best and
    render <BR>them in pencil and go from there in illustrator. <BR> <BR>Just one
    approach, and of course, my opinions are just that. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Troy, I think you have two separate ideas that you are trying to force together.
    A 30&#39;s retro theme and illustrating tasty design. If its the 30&#39;s feel
    you are after maybe the word you are looking for isn&#39;t tasty, but Elegant
    might fit better. In either case follow PJ&#39;s advice, I once had a mortgage
    refi project and I presented 15 concepts, marker on paper, 75 concepts later I
    got the 3 that left the agency and i can tell you I&#39;d still be working on
    them if I did it on a computer.
