  body: "I rather like it! Is it modded from Rockwell or similar?\r\n\r\nPerhaps consider
    treating the X and L closer to the As and P, or only give one A that treatment
    and set it off - the A is where the relationship to architecture is most clear.\r\n\r\nAny
    good shots of Mexican colonial architecture to elaborate on this?"

  body: "You could try a more rounded form of X (like the two Cs back to back script
    form) with the central 'serif' style applied. I find the angles and lightness
    of stroke jarring next to the other characters. \r\nThe M\xE9xico line is a bit
    light/small for some uses and the Brodyesque \xC9 is out of character, you could
    try it without the vertical serifs.\r\nTim"

  body: "Okey, sounds good.. im gonna try it and post some new versions, also the
    pictures... it\xB4s been very rainy and cold these days... the vertical serifs
    are part of the character since i\xB4d like to rescue to find the \"prehispanic
    feel\" as you can see in my avatar\xB4s prehispanic head. Do you think they don\xB4t
    function well??"

    character. The serifs on the top line that resemble the keystones of arches work
    well.\r\nTim"
