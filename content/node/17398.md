  but has anyone else looked at the fonts that are used on episodes of LOST?\r\n\r\nThe
  countdown timer inside the hatch is using Arial [except for the digit 1, which is
  in Helvetica], however most everything in the hatch looks like it's from the 70s.
  So Arial wouldn't have been around yet.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's that Apple II computer.
  Of course the computer display was done in post, but... why Palatino? Why there?\r\n\r\nFor
  some reason, those details bugged me so much I was looking at them frame-by-frame
  on the TiVo. Anyone care to add anyting to my ramble this morning? :)\r\n\r\n\r\nmike"

  body: what bothers me is the disconnect between the Kabel uppercase in their animated
    logo and whatever they got goin on for the main logo. i mean, couldn't they have
    got a bit of uniformity in there? but yeah, the computer console looks really
    stupid. they should have chosen something like OCR-A or a generic bitmap font,
    doncha think?

    because they didn't think that ordinary people would notice the anachronism. (But
    we're not ordinary people, are we?) The Helvetica '1' is quite distinctive, though,
    so I believe you. I don't see why they'd mix the fonts though. This would take
    extra effort, which they apparently didn't put into other typographical elements.
