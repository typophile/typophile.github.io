  company is called Post Industrial (PI)\r\n\r\nI tried combining it with the number
  \u03C0 (3.1415...) in abstract ways.\r\nLet me know what approach you like best
  and what I could improve. If you have any other good ideas, please tell me.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    the much friendlier a-4 also."

  body: "@Ratbaggy:\r\nThe initials of Post Industrial are P.I., hence the Greek letter
    &pi;.\r\n\r\nYes, B is certainly the strongest.  If Post Industrial did anything
    mathematical or industrial, or creative with technological applications, then
    &pi; would have especially apt associations.  Still, B is very nice.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick

    it simple smarty. You are selling your services to small businesses, not MIT

    sometimes, what I'm still not too sure about is wether or not to work with a pictogram

    the fact the initials of the business name are PI isn't a focal point, it doesn't
    tell a story about what they do (and if it does ... it's probably the wrong story.)\r\n\r\n:)\r\n<br

  body: "I don't know if i should be ashamed or not to say that you're not off to
    a very good start. The type choices are fairly \"system\" based and don't give
    much character to the idea of the company nor play off the name in a figurative
    or metaphorical way.\r\n\r\nWhy is it called Post Industrial? Is this a real company
    or a student project?\r\n\r\nI'm still very unclear as to what the company does?
    Provides small business solutions doesn't mean anything. What solutions does it
    provide? Accounting, design, manufacturing, rich media?\r\n\r\nThe name is interesting
    in that the rise of micro economies is in full force or the D.I.Y. movement as
    some would call it. What i mean is that the name could infer \"being past mass
    consumerism\" and you are a middle man that is bridging the gap between them.
    Though since we don't know what services you're offering it's hard to tell.\r\n\r\nSteps-\r\n\r\n1.
    Restate the purpose of the business and what services it specifically provides.\r\n2.
    Research the competition to avoid cliches and well know your enemies\r\n3. Research
    visual elements, styles that could be used in service of creating variation on
    the identities.\r\n4. Find a hybrid of the above, put them togther and bring them
    back to the forum for a better, insightful critique.\r\n\r\n"

    said, the Pi association is purely coincidental and will only serve to confuse
    not enrich.\r\n\r\nI would work on the concept from the ground up and back again.
    Think of who they sell to and what there clients are really buying with their
    service. Is it speed, peace of mind etc.\r\n\r\nJay"
