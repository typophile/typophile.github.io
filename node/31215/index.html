<div class=commentbody>4 - Might be Pistilli Roman. Consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.123688.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=overboard&sampleSize=48">Didoni</a>.
5 - Just as you would expect: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.10466.0.0">FF Sheriff</a>
1 - Comes straight from the [[Font magazine]] article on <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/features/fontmag/002/02_atma/index.cfm>FF Atma</a>
2 - This is [[Font Bureau]]'s printed catalog, featuring <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Interstate">Interstate</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Sloop">Sloop</a>, and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FB.104965.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=3&sampleSize=288">Belizio</a>.
flaunt - As a magazine logo, this is likely custom. Closest I can get is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=MSF.118749.5.15&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=FLAUN%2B&sampleSize=48">Mostra</a>.
Out of curiosity, where did you get these images?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe you should buy yourself some books (e.g. the FontBook) and actually look there before you simply pass along the work to other people. We like to help, generally, but this way, you'll never learn anything yourself.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hear hear, Erik. I often think the "Where can I do my own research?" section of the FAQ ought to be a stand-alone. I understand that a lot of people are busy or just need a one-off ID and also that it takes a certain amount of time and experience to get to know how to ID a font, but when I see multiple repeat posters I start to wonder if they're just a little lazy.</div>

<div class=commentbody>yes, I do have a font book but some of them are not in the book and most of them are found typefaces either by me or other people. Thats why I'm here to ask all the questions I've been having. Is that wrong? :(</div>

<div class=commentbody>typopo_80> No you are not wrong! You are fine. It is advantageous to have a comprehensive catalog of fonts for your own reference as stated. However, often times the types that inspires us are used in such a way that is unexpected. This charms us and we want to know more about the type being used. Sometimes you discover that the font you want to know about is something you have already worked with or are familiar with. Yet you didn't recognize it because it looks so far from your expectations.
If you post often, I don't think you are lazy. I think you are person who loves type. So you're no problem. If someone disagrees with your frequent posts take the educational value from it but no one knows your situation like you. No one cares about your needs like you. And if you take of you, everyone else can take a long walk off a short pier- right? :-)
And besides, for a great deal of the people that participate in the Typophile ID's- its a race to who has the correct answer first. Its a fun thing and many people derive pleasure from participating. I don't care how I help the other person- I just care that I help them.

Mike Diaz ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I still think it's wrong to ask without looking first if you can find it yourself. That way, you never learn what to look for and how to look. Most of the faces you posted are in the FontBook or other easily available sources. You will not benefit from easy answers, but from having to figure it out yourself.
<br>That has nothing to do with other people having fun identifying posts.</br></div>

<div class=commentbody>eriks> What you fail realize is that I recognize this user, typopo_80, is totally new here. And possibly new to the world of type in general. Often times it's not just where you go to learn. Its how-to-learn-how-to-learn. How to go about starting the learning process (in type that is). That's why I said when someone disagrees with the frequent posts, take the criticisms in a didactic manner. The way you suggested can be better for some, but we should not be too quick to judge or place conditions on new people as they get their start. Once you start on Typophile, you don't stop, so I think the rest of what you are talking about will come naturally in the future.
Also, Typo does have the FontBook but at 1700 pages plus, its understandable that someone who is inexperienced perceiving the nuances of type (Myriad vs. Bliss, Fago vs. Unit) After pages of Handgloves and abcdefghi... it's not laziness. So he is doing the right thing coming here. In another post Typo indicated that he attempted using some web resources but he did not understand it. Can you blame him? Type "font information" in Google. See all that 'stuff'. Its a lot to swallow. And Typo is doing the best he knows how. Its fortunate he is Typophile member so he can learn more from the pros themselves.
As far ID-er's having fun: I said this because some people questioned his motives for posting the ID's. When in reality it is his business and its not like he's running the white house. We don't need to give Typo the frownies :-( over trivial things like fonts. Insert chill-pill in mouth, chase with water.
We might have extensive knowledge about whatever subject we hold dear, but we need to take into consideration the skill level and natural ability of others when sharing it. And that requires humility.
