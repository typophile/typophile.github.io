  (http://counterspace.motivo.com)? The site seems to be down right now, just as we've
  reached the \"Intro to Typography\" portion of the class I teach. I've meant for
  a while to contact the Counterspace folks to see if I could host a mirror of the
  site as I know it goes down from time to time. It's a great site for my students,
  but I'm at a bit of loss at the moment as I've directed them to use Counterspace
  as a study tool and, well, it's suddenly unavailable.\r\n\r\nSo, back to my question.
  Anyone know who runs Counterspace?\r\n\r\nJason"

    Culture</a> has a research area with loads of great information. Could be useful
    while Counterspace is down.

    links page will be really helpful. I've passed the URL on to my class listserv
    so they can all start exploring. Thanks again."

  body: Can't thank you enough esdc, I've been trying and trying the old address and
    it was driving me nuts. Again, thanks. I can push my students that way now (with
    only another week or two left in the term, they need all the help they can get)...

      a number of years ago. I have moved it to a new server at my company counterspace.
      I would be glad to hear any and all thoughts about the site. I am currently
      rethinking and redesigning the site to update it after 10 years. phew seems
      like a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThanks for the interest\r\n\r\nbrett"

  body: "The classification explanations are wrong in relation to their headings.
    (The actual explanations are right but, for example, the transitional explanation
    comes under the title 'slab serif'). One error in the sans serif classification
    where you seem to imply that sans serifs didn't exist untill the Bauhaus. \r\n\r\nThe
    site in general looks good and useful, but I don't like the into. But that is
    not just your intro as i hate all flash intros. \r\n\r\nPhil"
