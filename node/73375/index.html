		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael,
The reason why you question your ability to write off this theft as a business loss is derived from the fact that you know better. Your claim is that what? Nine thousand font licenses were stolen? That would work if, say, you had invoices from each of the transactions and proof that in each case the payment was stopped—but even then, you could merely void their license agreements. So this specific argument doesn&rsquo;t hold up. You can &lsquo;steal&rsquo; or illegally obtain fonts, but I don&rsquo;t see any way to steal font licenses (your product).
Yes, you have suffered legitimate, real damages, but you are only entitled to redress as far as and in the ways you&rsquo;ve protected yourself in your EULA, and to the extent the law applies.</p>
<p>Virtue is the only complete solution to this problem.</p>

<p>A TRULY Unique PSID would be invaluable. I suppose that a font vendor could store font data as XML, then merge that data at point-of-sale with a unique add-on ID tied to the buyer&rsquo;s name, email and&ndash;even better, but it would never fly&ndash;credit card information, and do an XML-to-OTF conversion. I doubt that this will happen, but what if such a &ldquo;What if&rdquo; scenario were circulated among the type-buying public?</p>

So, if you wanted to actually make a printed product, you then had to buy the hi-res version for the printer.</p>
<p>In the end I threw away the font after I got a new Mac, and failed to install Foefler Didot, because I could not find the original password slip.</p>
<p>So, that method is not viable in my books, but &lsquo;stamping&rsquo; might work. It should be done automatically, or as a choice in preferences, by your font building program in a deep enough level for hackers to simply removing it.</p>

That way, if someone serves up my font for free, I can download it, find the unique value, and find out to whom it was originally sold.
Suppose it&rsquo;s a complete font family package, and all the values correspond to a single purchase placed by a design firm: I could write them and suggest they keep a closer eye on their interns. ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>After rereading the thread I posted above, your suggestion is what they ended up doing after their initial plan (having the fonts installed by an installer, and invisible on your system to anything but the installer) didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to know if they manually put the serial number somewhere in the font file before generating the OTF to send to the customer, or if there&rsquo;s some automated way of doing this.</p>
<p>It all seems like a lot of work for very minimal gain. A foundry would have to spend a fair amount of time and energy generating and keeping track of those serial numbers, and even more time tracking them down, and yet more time writing strongly worded letters to the offenders (or paying a lawyer to do it for them). And in the end, unless they can convince the person to buy a license (which might not be worth more than the time they&rsquo;ve put into tracking the person down), they won&rsquo;t end up any further ahead financially.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that trying to minimize piracy isn&rsquo;t worthwhile, but I don&rsquo;t think this particular method is worth the time.</p>

<p>If I understand the capabilities of TTX correctly&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.font.org/software/ttx/">http://www.font.org/software/ttx/</a></p>
<p>A program like Access could record the purchaser&rsquo;s information linked to a sequential unique number in a database, place that same number within an XML file, then instruct TTX to generate the OTF font&ndash;all entirely automated.</p>
<p>However, maybe it&rsquo;s time we taught respect for Intellectual Property Rights in our schools. Back in Ye Olden Days, a person who purchased a book might lend it to a friend but, unless that friend had a LOT of time on his or her hands during which they could copy the book by hand, said friend would read the book, then return it to the buyer. If the friend wanted his or her own copy, he or she would have to buy it&ndash;or steal it from a local bookstore or library. Kids need to be taught that sharing digital files with friends is not sharing: it&rsquo;s stealing.</p>

It could be that the design firm has an employee who pirated the font files—or (assuming the firm&rsquo;s designers take home their work) anyone that any of those employees come in contact with could have passed it to someone else who could have pirated it. What good would a type foundry accomplish telling an advertising agency that the fonts they bought had later been pirated? They would say &lsquo;Well I didn&rsquo;t distribute it.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I may have been ambiquous earlier. My suggestion is: in FontLab Studio preferences you can check a box to add a unique ID number to every font you create, every time you create one, as a default. After you have finished your design, and you&rsquo;ve got that product you&rsquo;re happy to license, either yourself, or through another firm. Important is that it has that unique ID number, whether it&rsquo;s been copied any number of times. If that ID number is embedded deep enough into the file, that should stay there.</p>
<p>So, I would hand this over to font design programmers.</p>

<p>No: when you pay your hard-earned money for a font, it is equal to buying an apple. If you give a copy of the font to a friend, it is equal to stealing the hard-earned money of the man or woman who grew the apple.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I treat myself to some pirated fonts every now and then. I am similar to the mentioned font pirate Tomi from Suomi mentioned, I do collect fonts a bit, play around with them if I need distraction from writing. Except that I see that fonts should be paid for, still I don&rsquo;t see a reason why I as a person who never uses them for anything I would hand over to other people, or anything I would make money with, should pay for it. If there were not pirated fonts, I would not get them anyhow, as I do not really need them.</p>
<p>There are however a few fonts I bought, in total three families, to established a signature style. I paid like 160 $ for three different typefaces with three weights each: roman/italics/bold. These fonts I actually intend to use at some time and did use one typeface already in the past. They were cheap enough that I was convinced to get them and they were what I was looking for in appearance for a signature style.</p>
<p>So what does that make me? A thief? An honest person? I guess I just have my own morals. I am sorry for you guys who feel bestolen, but as I said, I never intend to produce anything with them that would leave my very own computer.</p>
<p>Everybody who uses fonts professionally or for extensive personal use (signature style) should buy them, that&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah, my nick is slightly ironic – intentionally.</p>
<p>Peace guys, do not take it so hard, if you are bound to be successful, you will be anyhow. If your designs don&rsquo;t fly, then not because it was pirated in mass, but because designers, art-directors, printers, book-setters, companies, etc… did not see the right fit for them or there is no current need to expand the portfolio.</p>
<p>I would not be outraged by 9000 downloads of people who never will buy fonts, I would be outraged by big companies not paying for fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>to stick with an apple analogy:</p>
<p>Apples are produced and sold to be eaten, right?</p>
<p>What would be the analogy? Fonts are made to be incorporated into some kind of creation. If a pirated font is not used in a creation that surfaces in the living world, where is the difference to the state of where the font were never pirated in the first place?</p>
<p>Somebody said that what is actually broken is the license agreement. I feel like that I do not need a licence for anything I only do in my own 4 walls. For what I do not make available to the public, what would I need a license for? I do not see any damage in it, pirating or not.</p>
<p>As I said, I have licences for three families, I do honor them, and do not share those fonts with friends or anybody else. Those I use outside my 4 walls. Because I do not have control over other people&rsquo;s attitude towards sharing I do not share fonts myself in general.</p>
<p>My world is not black and white, although I do know that it is illegal, I do not care for legality if nobody gets hurt and nobody gets caught.</p>

<p>But this hits the nail on the head. I&rsquo;ll let you make a wish. You can either have zero piracy and the font retailing model of 20 yrs ago, or you can have today&rsquo;s piracy and today&rsquo;s retail model. Easy choice right?</p>
<p>Piracy has devastated the music industry, but I see no evidence that it&rsquo;s hurt the font industry at all on a net basis. On the contrary, there are more type designers (and more successful type designers) than ever.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that piracy doesn&rsquo;t exist and that it doesn&rsquo;t have real costs. But you have to net it out against the gains. If the Gap wants to know how well it&rsquo;s doing, it doesn&rsquo;t just look at how much merchandise is being shoplifted.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t see a solution to this problem ever coming from within the font file itself or from the download controls of vendors. The simplest and most effective way of eliminating font piracy will be to overhaul the operating system engine that serves fonts to applications to require activation like any other software in order to operate on a unique system.</p>
<p>For example, Adobe Creative Suite&rsquo;s activation process was met with initial resistance (predictable), but has mostly become routine and manageable for end users who really need to use the software. Efforts to undermine the activation process have met limited success and are out of technical reach for the vast majority of users. It has pretty effectively reduced piracy of CS.</p>
<p>Having the infrastructure to manage such activation systems is probably overkill for many small foundries, but it would not take much work for someone to create a reasonable server-based PHP/MySQL solution that is affordable and secure. Or, multiple foundries could employ a central service through a subscription pay system.</p>
<p>It is Microsoft and Apple who must ultimately fix this at the OS level. As long as the OS treats fonts like resource files to which users can have complete access and control, then users will treat them that way too, instead of treating them like legitimate software.</p>

<p>That is your saying, but no one had ever showed my an evidence that you have lost any thing, it is a mere hypothesis.</p>
<p>So let me make my hypothesis, since we all have no real evidences mine should be as valid as yours. A person receiving a copy of your fonts from a friend are one of two, an amateur who is unlikely to pay for your fonts anyway, so you practically lost nothing, even more, he might love your fonts and become a fan who just buys them because he loves them, like novel fans. Or may be he is professional designer, and he would either like your font and become a potential consumer, or dislike it and was not going to buy your font anyway.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The only thing you can change about piracy is how you feel about it. Sometimes stealing is sharing. Sometimes sharing is stealing. Sometimes sharing is sharing. Sometimes stealing is stealing. Anyone who claims that any of these is always the case is wrong.</p>
<p>Torrents, rapidshares, alt.binaries and pirate font sites: sales are affected. Maybe every 9000 downloads, costs you 10 sales. Maybe it costs you 0.05 sales. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it doesn&rsquo;t cost you 100 sales.</p>
<p>You can try to classify the type of person who pirates fonts but to what end? Some of those people are your customers, some aren&rsquo;t. A few times, just for fun, I&rsquo;ve sent a free commercial font license to someone who was asking for my fonts on a pirate site. Why not? You don&rsquo;t lose a sale anyway and you might gain a Twitter follower.</p>
<p>Do your paying customers a favor: put your bitter mall cop energy into making new fonts and improving old ones. If your fonts end up on a free font site, that&rsquo;s what you need to worry about. I didn&rsquo;t always feel that way but that&rsquo;s the conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to after over a decade of selling fonts. I&rsquo;d have a few less fonts in my library if I spent more time on a pirate crusade or feeling bad about it.</p>
<p>However: free font sites that mistakenly carry commercial fonts can hurt sales. They deliver fonts to people who think they&rsquo;re supposed to be freeware. I think those are worth the effort on a polite reminder/impolite take down.</p>

<p>Hypothetical: You are a physician. A man sits outside your office and asks each entering potential patient about his complaint. The man says, &ldquo;I know just the thing,&rdquo; and writes a prescription. The potential patient says, &ldquo;I though only doctors could write prescriptions.&rdquo; The man says, &ldquo;I stole a prescription pad from him, so now I can write them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that already happens here, most patients are likely to go to pharmacy first and the pharmacist would give them a free prescription and sell them the medicine, a very common practice though is officially illegal, it stems from very old traditions. How physicians fell about that? nothing, as long as they ask serious patients to seek real medical advice. And yes, I lose nothing, those people are unlikely to afford paying me anyway, and if they get cured, more power to them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kudos for your attitude, Mr. Larabie.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why the apple analogy is ruining the entire &ldquo;content industry.&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t steal an apple from the market stand because you see the apple&rsquo;s owner, and the owner sees you. If there were no one around and you really wanted an apple, wouldn&rsquo;t you at least consider taking one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know you can multiply apples infinitely, so you don&rsquo;t even have to physically take the apple away. You magically duplicate it and walk away with a brand new apple, and the farmer will never know. Does that feel like hurting him? Not really.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I buy a newspaper, or a CD, it feels like buying an apple: we trade objects for coins. When a newspaper website makes me pay 50¢ to read an article, I feel ripped off. 50¢ may be nothing, but I suddenly pay without getting a physical object in return that would justify the cost. The fact that the supply of copies is now infinite lowers its perceived value to zero. Fonts are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crazy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> expensive (unless you&rsquo;re a professional who can put them on the clients' bill). (Almost) no one, at least not me, will buy a family for more than a couple bucks &ldquo;for fun&rdquo;. Us type designers very much overestimate the importance of our work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to teach your virtues to your kids, who, like me, grew up in a virtual world, where everything happens on screen. It just feels unnatural to us to bring the concept of money into this immaterial world. Doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intellectually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> understand you need money to survive, but 1), 2) and 3) are just so overwhelming.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>50 years from now, &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; business will have to work differently. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>(and yes, I make fonts myself. I just don&rsquo;t get why people in the creative business pretend the world is being deliberately evil to them.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s painting the picture in an unnecessarily broad, simplistic and self-serving stroke.

<p>You&rsquo;re preaching to the choir here. Do I know making a good font takes months of work? Yes, I do. Do I appreciate your work, and do I think you deserve to make a living? Hell yes. (In fact, I really like your decorative type.) Do I pirate fonts? Nope.</p>
<p>The same goes for Khaled I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>But you guys are completely out of touch with reality when you say things like &ldquo;Kids need to be taught that sharing digital files with friends is not sharing: it&rsquo;s stealing.&rdquo; There <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perceived<!-- raw HTML omitted --> difference, and that&rsquo;s what counts. If you want to babble on about EULAs and Intellectual Property, go ahead. Just look at what&rsquo;s happening to the CD/DVD industry (though they, unlike type designers, are cozy with politicians).</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t forget that there are more and more free (or bundled) fonts around that make people question the price tags of commercial fonts (sorry for contributing to that).</p>
<p>I wish my posts were more constructive, but I don&rsquo;t see an easy way out of this. Ray is doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Then again, if you just needed to vent your frustration, sorry to interrupt :)</p>

<p>I am quite confident that the average U.S. Southerner, before our Civil War, thought enslaving other human beings&ndash;as long as they were black&ndash;was perfectly acceptable. And, no doubt, the average Nazi soldier herding Jews into gas chambers thought he was doing his part&ndash;the right thing&ndash;to serve the Fatherland.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Comparing font piracy to slavery and genocide overstates the issue enormously. (Do I really need to say that?)</p>
<p>Perspective, please. We are talking about the mechanics of the free market. Nobody has the right to make a living off their work. (Not type designers &ndash; not creative artists generally &ndash; nobody.) The only right anyone has is to participate &amp; compete in the free market. Every corner of the free market has benefits. It has costs. And if you don&rsquo;t like that particular corner, you have the right to do something else with your time and effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;legal&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; are discussions that eventually get trumped by &ldquo;fact&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo;. Every piracy-protection system is broken sooner or later. People who don&rsquo;t want to pay for the product don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I completely agree with Typodermic that in rational economic terms, type designers are usually better off putting the &ldquo;mall cop energy&rdquo; into designing more type &amp; better type.</p>

<p>And there also &ldquo;a multi-billion dollar market&rdquo; for free software, indeed free software has copyrights (or copyleft) but its notion of &ldquo;IP protection&rdquo; is radically different than yours. I personally think any IP protection beyond the moral right of being credited to owns work, is a draconian measure that should be abolished.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everyone will pay for sw then, or be left behind…<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to pay for software (including fonts) now and I&rsquo;m using 100% legal (mostly copyleft) software, so I don&rsquo;t buy-in the idea that corporate-controlled so called cloud computing is going to take over software market. Free (as in freedom) is as old as computers and I don&rsquo;t think it is going away any time soon.</p>

<p>The essence of a market economy is exchange, not private-property rights. Items are successfully exchanged all the time in our economy that are not property, or not private.</p>
<p>There is a difference between &ldquo;enabling&rdquo; a market and &ldquo;enforcing&rdquo; it. By and large, the govt only takes a role in enforcement when it&rsquo;s a criminal matter. For copyright, patent, and contract, the govt makes private parties enforce the law. This is not a merely academic distinction. Economic incentives would be distorted if private parties did not internalize the costs of enforcement.</p>

<p>I am not pro-piracy (nor, last I checked, a Viking) but software markets DO exist without IP protection. For example, the iTunes store. For the last couple years, all songs have been sold in unprotected MP3 format. Has that impacted Apple&rsquo;s bottom line? For the better, apparently.</p>
<p>Example #2: fonts. There is no meaningful IP protection for fonts in the United States. Entire companies have been built around the premise of legally cloning existing fonts. But the market hasn&rsquo;t collapsed. That&rsquo;s not a pro-piracy argument. That&rsquo;s just pointing out that whatever is holding up the font market in the US, it&rsquo;s not private IP rights.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Adobe vs SSI established that you can&rsquo;t just copy and resell software from another company.</p>
<p>There have been several law suits against companies for violating font licenses. The de facto situation is that private individuals can use pirated fonts privately with impunity, but publishers and other companies cannot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>its notion of &ldquo;IP protection&rdquo; is radically different than yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are being presumptuous in thinking you know what my notion of &ldquo;IP protection&rdquo; is. I don&rsquo;t know myself, as I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, and haven&rsquo;t studied this complex matter.</p>
<p>I do think a few things: 1. if Adobe had lost to SSI instead of winning, and similar suits were defeated, it would have hurt the font industry. 2. If you download and use my font without paying for it, you are depriving legitimate income to both me and Font Bureau, who both worked on it&ndash;a lot. It is particularly nasty if you make money using the font without ever paying for it.</p>
<p>Matthew: The Font Bureau recently went after NBC for violating a EULA: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/10/font-bureau-clashes-with-nbc-over-font-licensing.ars">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/10/font-bureau-clashes-with-nbc-over-font-licensing.ars</a></p>
<p>The point is, the vikings (promoters of piracy) don&rsquo;t seem to be aware that while private piracy is overlooked, public piracy is not, and this is a commercially important fact.</p>
<p>There is a difference between IP protection and what is known as DRM, which tries to use technology to defeat piracy. Your example of Itunes is off the mark, because the music is copyrighted, and there have been suits for violation of copyright. If you don&rsquo;t think copyright matters commercially, just try and download the Beatles from Itunes.</p>
<p>Your point about the parties accepting the rules of exchange voluntarily is correct, but I think, that if the rules were never enforced by government, then the parties would not respect the rules. You just have too look at poor countries to see where the rule of law is much weaker, and commerce is as a result harmed. Poor countries are poor partly because of the lack of rule of law, and particularly the enforcement of contracts. This stuff actually matters a lot to the wealth of a country.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting discussion here.</p>
<p>Of course there is the legal side and the moral side.</p>
<p>The legal side again is in some countries divided in how much an EULA is actually worth. I can tell you for Austria (and Germany) that an EULA is worth nothing if you are not able to have a look at it before you give your consent to a buying contract (=paying). I guess this might be in many EU countries, this is why many &ldquo;rules&rdquo; so not apply.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sidenote<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>On a sidetone, I am always fascinated how vigorously people try to enforce the idea behind an EULA and think it is a moral rule to comply. It is not, it is a contract, which is only legal if the conditions under it came to happen are making an EULA binding. This might be different for every person who buys software (depending on country, shopping online/offline, which shop/vendor, etc…). If an EULA does not apply, normal law applies. The producer does not establish universally applicable rules or even a moral code with an EULA. Particularly I am fascinated - as Mac owner - how brainless Mac- and iPhone users defend the &ldquo;right&rdquo; of Apple to decide how to restrict their systems. (Mac OS only on Macs, Jailbreaking), while the right comes from the law, as the EULA does not apply, nor from Apple.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to topic<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So the legal side depends if the EULA applies, and if not, how are intellectual property rights are protected by domestic law.</p>
<p>Sharing among friends and family actually is legal in my country in a limited way, I think. That was called &ldquo;right for a private copy&rdquo;. But uploading something online in the anonymity of the internet, is not.</p>
<p>So even if one sticks to the law, legality can be a mixed bag.</p>
<p>For the morals, I do think that the creators of fonts should be rewarded for every font that is actually commercially used, not only those officially sold. So yes, font users should pay for their licenses. One should not obtain fonts without permission.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>There is no stealing involved. The act of using and obtaining a font without permission is not theft to me, it is a breach of market rules and intellectual property rights. The IPRs are not stolen, they are broken. I do agree something that is virtual can&rsquo;t be stolen, only unlawfully duplicated.</p>
<p>When it comes to the MARKET, there is no market with the exchange of free software. There is value of labor of the community which created all the code. There is a MARKET for services around free software. As well more and more big companies use the previous development for their own software, because the quality is just convincing and the costs for developing something new can be radically reduced. Thanks to the genius GNU license they need to give back their developed code to the public. Free software is winning right now especially in the mobile OS market.</p>
<p>But when I say there is no market with the exchange of free software, then I mean that there is no market where a piece of free software is being exchanged for a price, which is good. There is anyhow an immense value created by free software, by the services around them, and by the possibilities to develop certain products they open up for other business.</p>
<p>But similar there is no market for shared fonts as such, as who shares a font does not get anything in return. Font-sharers are actually participating in the normal font market, as they simply do see the price higher than the value of a legal license would create for them. Now of course that does not say anything about the morals of it. Does it hurt the market? I guess it depends. In a market setting where there is one threshold where there are people who buy fonts based on the value a legal license has for them (and the risk an illegal font includes) and there are people who do not buy them, on can only change the ratio between the two fractions by: 
(a) introducing new differentiations at different price marks
(b) by increasing the quality of the official good (increase language support, Open Type functions, special characters, etc&hellip;)
(c) or by increasing the risk an illegal obtained font poses.</p>
<p>The first two things are something you guys can do. Thinking about the creation of &ldquo;amateur versions&rdquo; I can imagine here it is hard to find the threshold what should be cut, what not, and give it a price tag. Would it make sense? Depends on how big the market is. Depends if those people who are font-sharers would be convinced enough by the price and feature set to reach into their wallets. Here it is hard to say, as some font-sharers maybe will for ideological reasons refuse to pay any kind of price?</p>
<p>Anyhow what Ray said, which is option (b), makes a shared version (and I assume a fonts gets shared in the beginning, updates then not so much, as for the first version the availability would be higher so the update-share would not compete) less attractive to those people who are likely to pay: professionals. So improving a font might be a good option.</p>
<p>(c) would be the discussed mall-sheriff politics.</p>
<p>my two euro-cents. ;)</p>

<p>Whenever I say free software, I mean free software as [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html|defined by the free software movement]], so as long as the fonts (or any other software) meet these criteria, I&rsquo;m fine working on it, whether voluntarily or paid.</p>
<p>There is no single way to make money from free software, however it usually works like this for me: I start working on some free project for fun, for learning or scratching an itch, then some company would approach me and offer paying me for doing what I was essentially doing for free because they have some specific need and wants me to give it a higher priority. And that is win-win game, for me, for the company and for the community. Some times the money gets from some NGO or other non-profit organisations that wants to support certain developments that fits with there goals, and free software projects are usually better candidates for such organisations. The same, more or less, applies to my work on fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Khaled, you are being paid to produce this software, so that&rsquo;s my second category, above. I think that&rsquo;s great. In the font world, as in the rest of software, this is a segment of the market. But I fail to see how that is morally superior to producing a font essentially without knowing whether it will pay you anything, and then having people buy it.</p>
<p>In either case you are being supported by the market place, either directly or indirectly. Of course the group paying you may be government or a non-profit corporation, but I still don&rsquo;t see why this is morally superior.</p>
<p>So I would ask: is it immoral for a farmer to invest and produce an apple, and sell it in the market place, for which you need rule of law (the police need to stop thieves from raiding the market)? Is it immoral for a designer to produce a font and sell it in the market place, for which you need IP protection?</p>
<p>Very few high quality fonts are free in the sense of the free software movement you cite. Most fonts used by computer users are now bundled fonts, which cannot legally be shared with those who don&rsquo;t have a license for the software they are bundled with, such as Microsoft Office or Windows, or one of the Adobe products. So I don&rsquo;t see how you can argue that the &lsquo;free software&rsquo; movement will produce all the fonts that people want.</p>
<p>In the case of Web Fonts, we right now see this moving forward as a test case. Raf Levien, who frequents Typophile now and then, has been an advocate of the free software movement, and has led Google&rsquo;s effort to put up free web fonts accessible through Google.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that will be a piece of the pie. But also FontFont, Adobe, and FontBureau and Ascender have got on board with web fonts. If history is any guide a lot of those with web sites will find these commercial fonts better for their purposes than the free web fonts that Google is supplying.</p>
<p>The point is, the market place is not in itself immoral, and helps people.</p>
<p>I think the anger against it is misguided. Who am I hurting if design a font on my own time, and offer it on the market place, for those who are willing to license it and not share it with others who may also want to buy it?</p>
<p>They have lots of other options, including free ones. The market place helps develop more and often better options.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m glad we don&rsquo;t have the font equivalent of the RIAA. I want the sharing world to exist. It&rsquo;s always going to be a few font versions behind, it lacks tech support which ends up providing incentive to buy. That&rsquo;s the stick that encourages people to consider the option of buying it.</p>
<p>I used to sell personal use licenses the they were ignored. I used to go back to check the domains of who was purchasing the personal use licenses. About half were ad agencies and a look through their portfolios would reveal my fonts being used for commercial use. More than half of the personal use licenses I sold could be seen in commercial use. I&rsquo;m not exaggerating. I think it&rsquo;s human nature to just buy the cheapest version and ignore the fine print. If you release amateur versions, they will be used for commercial use anyway so it just ends up being a way for commercial users to &ldquo;cheap out&rdquo;. I used to believe that another price option could be offered but I&rsquo;ve since learned that ad agencies always go for the cheapest option, even if commercial use is prohibited.</p>
<p>So how about we keep selling fonts, the file sharers will do their thing and everything&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p>Apple analogies aren&rsquo;t working (at least we don&rsquo;t all agree with it), so lets get over that. Every one is free to produce the fonts he likes, sell them the way he likes, give them for free or do whatever he want, again I&rsquo;ve no problem with that. What I&rsquo;ve problem with, as far as this thread is concerned, is the continuous effort to stigmatize file sharing, equate to theft, declare it immoral. No, it is not, it might be illegal under certain jurisdictions, and that what is all about. Illegal is not equal to immoral.</p>
<p>Also, people need to understand that you can give your fonts for free and still make profit, right here right now in this world, not in &ldquo;Hosnyland&rdquo; where &ldquo;manna falls from heaven&rdquo;, and it is not only for crazy free software zealots, but also &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; foundries .Droid fonts, Liberation fonts and the upcoming Ubuntu font, all are free software (though usually bundled with other free software, can be legally distributed alone) and all were produced by professional foundries that got paid for their work. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that every one should follow that model, though I&rsquo;d certainly be happy if every one did, I just want type designers and foundries acknowledge the existence of different economical models than what they are used to, and not quickly dismiss, and laugh on, the idea of free fonts whenever it is brought on.</p>

<p>Legality and morality are not identical, as you say. But in the case of illegally sharing font files, yes it is immoral as well, because the law is legitimate. The IP laws give designers create one legitimate way to earn money from their efforts, and to violate the law is to do to them harm, and unethical theft.</p>

<p>Exactly, so would you give it a guess?
My hypothesis is simply that fonts are way less important than we think. &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; people never bought fonts anyway: fifty years ago, maybe you had a typewriter. Twenty years ago, maybe you had a computer.
Today, you can buy a type family for $200 on myfonts. I know a handful of people who &ldquo;steal&rdquo; fonts mostly for their personal entertainment. If they can&rsquo;t find what they&rsquo;re looking for in 5 minutes, they use Times and forget about it. They&rsquo;re not your potential clients <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyway<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so stop worrying.</p>

<p>This, however, may become a problem; especially with my generation now leaving design schools. And I would really be interested in some numbers. Maybe I can do polls somewhere?</p>

<p>To violate the law by copying a digital file without the IP holder&rsquo;s permission is not, in and of itself, harming the IP holder. It may. It may not. To say it does with all certainty is an incorrect blanket statement.</p>
<p>Theft, legally, is the taking of someone&rsquo;s physical property. It has nothing to do with copying digital files. This would be in the context of US Law. It may differ elsewhere.</p>

<p>I understand that POV from within this forum. After all, many folks in here make a living selling digital files. So I don&rsquo;t fault folks for that gut-reaction. But it doesn&rsquo;t really serve the greater debate outside these walls to perpetuate them.</p>

<p>What may have consistently failed to grasp in this discussion is that fonts, not unlike fashion accessories, often have a limited shelf life. Is Comic Sans really such a terrible font? Actually, no: it’s well-done and useful in the proper context. The reason that it is so reviled is that it’s used far too often, and used wrongly, far too often, as well.</p>
<p>Fonts come into and go out of fashion and, the more often a font is used, the sooner its popularity will wane. The freeloaders who download from file sharing sites aren’t potential sales lost: the cheap bastards won’t pay for anything they’re not forced to. But each time an unbought font is used, it cheapens the font overall. Here, loss of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->income<!-- raw HTML omitted --> isn’t the point: loss of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->value<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is.</p>
<p>For example, back in Ye Olden Hippie Days, the folks who began the trend of wearing bellbottoms bought their pants at the Army-Navy store: surplus woolen (real, not Old) Navy bellbottoms with a drop-flap fly fastened by thirteen buttons (note to beer drinkers: not the right apparel choice if you’re planning on hoisting several brews with your buddies). Eventually, niche retailers started offering their versions but, once Sears started selling them, the trend was officially dead.</p>

<p>In US law, that is not true. A copyright holder who registers their copyright is entitled to pursue statutory damages from an infringer, ranging from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed. These statutory damages exist because harm from infringement is presumed.</p>

<p>In US law, that is also not true. &ldquo;Theft&rdquo; is not limited to physical property. Theft of services, for example, is still theft. Copyright infringement is also theft. See the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997, which expanded criminal prosecutions for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an article on &ldquo;Intellectual Property Theft&rdquo; published by the US govt:</p>

<p>Legally speaking, very true.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s simply a presumption (one that was helped along with heavy lobbying for things like the DMCA). In reality, the harm is as likely to not be there as it is to be there.</p>
<p>Which is why true debates on these topics can get complex. The legal arguments don&rsquo;t necessarily always parallel ethical arguments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copyright infringement is also theft. See the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997&rdquo;</p>
<p>which states&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminal intellectual property theft offenses include copyright and trademark infringement and theft of trade secrets. Civil intellectual property suits include copyright, trademark, and patent infringement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, alas, now we&rsquo;re getting into a debate that, sans a law degree, I&rsquo;m woefully out of my league on. Debating legal semantics sounds like fun, but I&rsquo;m simply not well versed on it.</p>
<p>Key point, though, is that it&rsquo;s not really that helpful to use analogies to physical property theft. They are such different concepts, both ethically and legally, that I&rsquo;d argue the use of said analogies only harm the debate rather than help it along.</p>
<p>@oldnick&hellip;that&rsquo;s a valid point on the dilution of the value. A fake $50 Prada bag sold on a NYC street corner isn&rsquo;t likely a direct financial hit to Prada, but one can certainly argue that it has lessened Prada&rsquo;s value overall.</p>
<p>That said&hellip;an already popular font that is now popular and over-exposed due to file trading is a likely as scenarios as a not popular font that has now become commercially successful due to exposure due to file trading.</p>
<p>What mostly irritates me, though, is your point combined with what Larabie brought up&hellip;it sounds like the most likely element contributing to likely lost sales is within the design industry itself. Which is a real shame.</p>

<p>What he said.</p>
<p>Nick, I never meant to flame, snot-nosed or not. I just think it&rsquo;s unwise to try to turn back time (cf. perception vs. reality). I can walk away from this discussion unharmed, but if it&rsquo;s as bad as you say, then you have to make a decision: stay in business – or not. I care about indie type designers – as opposed to the music/film/software/news giants, who begin to actually annoy me with their complaints about IP theft.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking for numbers – the way your sales are developing, do you think you will/would still be selling fonts 30 years from now? If you take Ray&rsquo;s attitude, will illegal downloads ruin you before the market over-saturation will?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The sales losses I was referring to only relate to personal vs commercial pricing. Customers were offered two price points. When I checked the domains of the personal use buyers, they tended to be design agencies, freelance designers or small business owners. Many people use a webmail account when purchasing fonts so I couldn&rsquo;t check those. Most of the buyers had unique domains and most were design agencies, freelance designers or small business owners. As I said, if I visited those sites a months later, I could usually find those works in their portfolios . . . so they&rsquo;re not just using them to create lost dog posters.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to go into stalker mode and google the webmail addresses, I was just trying <a href="http://www.domain.com">www.domain.com</a>. Before I checked I would never have guessed that the personal use licenses would be so commonly ignored.</p>
<p>My wife thinks it&rsquo;s just human nature. When there are two identical looking packs of mushrooms at two prices, most people automatically grab the cheapest one without thinking. There&rsquo;s also less incentive to buy the expensive version. With a personal use license you still get fresh fonts, support and free updates.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any reason to believe that it relates to file sharing. I suspect there were losses because of it because those agencies would have probably ponied up the extra $15 to buy the same font.</p>
<p>My sales are pretty consistent. I don&rsquo;t find that I&rsquo;m selling less fonts but in the last 5 years, I&rsquo;ve noticed a change in the types of fonts people are buying. Text fonts are in. Serious display fonts are in. Whimsical display fonts are out. Retro themed display fonts like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Soap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used to shoot up the charts like butter. Now they tend to generate zero sales. I don&rsquo;t think the change in the market relates to file sharing because people were sharing fonts in the Reagan era. Now that fonts are cheaper, have flashier storefronts, friendlier licenses and are easier to buy, it probably gives people more incentive to purchase. Buying a font in 1993 was probably not as easy as buying a font in 2010 so agencies were more likely to seek out a illicit floppies.</p>
<p>It all works out. Sharing makes you lose some sales, it makes you gain some sales and there&rsquo;s sweet fuck all you can do about it anyway. So relax, make fonts and don&rsquo;t fret. If your sales are slow in 2010 it&rsquo;s probably because so many font categories are oversaturated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have an interesting idea for an anti-piracy system. Create OpenType versions of fonts that employ the LIGA feature to replace common letter pairs with other pairs, creating spelling errors in the work of people who use pirate fonts in commercial work. Then upload these fonts to all the common font sharing sites so that commercial designers stop trusting pirate fonts. The cost of losing a client or having to eat printing costs because of using a pirate font seems like a great way to dissuade people from pirating type.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Khaled Hosny and Aluminum,</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try two more constructive angles on this discussion.</p>
<p>First, can you agree that changes in technology have created a problem for typeface designers as well as the obvious benefits?</p>
<p>In the age of metal type, typeface designers were more certain that those who used their typefaces would contribute financially to them so they could make enough of a living to continue designing typefaces. This was because acquiring a designer&rsquo;s typeface without paying for it was actually quite laborious. Most people who wanted to use a designer&rsquo;s typeface would opt for the simpler solution of paying for it, thus contributing to the existence of a type-design industry. That is, in the age of metal type, both the designers and their customers contributed to their being typeface design in the future.</p>
<p>With the switch to digital type, typeface designers have a big problem. It is now easier for a customer who wants to use their type to simply take it and use it without any reciprocity, without contributing to the typeface designer&rsquo;s financial ability to go on creating type. As modern history has shown over and over, a person can only continue a career for exactly as long as it remains financially viable to do so. If people use a typeface designer&rsquo;s work without paying for it, they are effectively changing the reciprocity of the relationship. They are through their actions saying that they expect typeface designers to continue investing in typefaces but that they themselves do not wish to invest any longer in there being new typefaces designed. They are changing the relationship from symbiosis, in which both participants benefit, to parasitism, in which the designer does all the work and the &ldquo;sharers&rdquo; help themselves to all the benefits.</p>
<p>The alternative financial models you proposed rely on corporations with deep enough pockets who have a financial incentive to prop up the typeface-design industry by subsidizing the work they approve of. I don&rsquo;t see this as the positive alternative you do, because it takes the decision-making about which fonts will exist in the future out of the hands of designers and puts it in the hands of corporations. That is, anyone will still be able to design whatever they want, but the only ones who will thrive are the ones who cater to the financial interests of the corporations. To me and many other people, this seems a lot less like a utopia than a dystopia.</p>
<p>I would much prefer that customers and designers drive the marketplace, but that will only work as long as their relationship remains a symbiosis, that is, as long as customers are willing to be active and helpful participants who give back to the relationship.</p>
<p>In other words, the problem that Typerror, OldNick, and others are trying to describe may not fit some definitions of theft, but whatever you choose to call it there is a real harm done that will lead to the deterioration of typeface design in the future - and that disproportionately hurts the very small, independent typeface designers who I would expect a free software advocate to champion.</p>
<p>I write this, by the way, as a veteran software designers who has made his entire career writing exclusively free and open-source software for twenty-six years and counting. Typeface designs are very different from normal software, so it is dangerous to analogize from one to the other to argue that typeface designs should also be free. With complex free software you can and must sell the expertise to go along with it, but anyone can set a vaguely legible page of text even without expert advice, so what can typeface designers sell to support themselves if they are supposed to give away all their designs for free? I don&rsquo;t believe your analogy to the free-software movement works for typefaces.</p>
<p>Second, the other argument one can make in discussions about what constitutes stealing is the question of need. If I steal an apple because my children are starving, many humane people would argue that those exigent circumstances at least partially excuse the crime. But does anyone ever NEED to share a typeface? Of course not. There are plenty of free typefaces already available. When someone helps themself to one of Typerror&rsquo;s typefaces without paying for it, they are engaging in that act needlessly.</p>
<p>We may argue about the semantics of the act, but whatever kind of injury is done by taking someone else&rsquo;s design parasitically - without reciprocity, without giving back to support the continuation of the designer&rsquo;s work - that act is entirely optional and voluntary. It&rsquo;s unnecessary. There are plenty of ways to look at this issue overall, but by this one measure it is a worse kind of injury than stealing an apple, not because of how it affects the designer but because of how it affects the &ldquo;sharer,&rdquo; who is engaging not in a reluctant act of desperation but in a casual and wholly unnecessary act of parasitism. This measure is not arbitrary; it&rsquo;s one of the measures universally considered during sentencing, when judges and juries are trying to decide how bad a person someone is, whether they are redeemable, whether the crime is excusable. Casual, calculated injuries are considered far more worrisome than those done out of need.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good for people to live their lives as passive dependents who take without giving back, the way small children have to. We are biologically wired to develop out of that infantile psychology (dependence) toward autonomy, first toward meeting our needs ourselves without as much help (independence), and then toward giving back to the world (interdependence), to paying back the investment our parents and communities made in us by paying it forward to our children and communities. As we approach those stages, we spend less time asking what we want and more time asking what we can do to help create the kind of world we believe in, to help shape the future.</p>
<p>If we want there to be typeface designers in the future, then we need to think about how we can contribute to their work. For the nondesigners among us, it seems to me that paying for new typeface designs is the simplest way we can do our part to protect the flow of new designs.</p>

<p>Throughout the history of humanity, people have survived by the concept of exchange. If we remove exchange and replace it with one way acquirement, we are just rationalizing ourselves to be the only entity with any needs. What would the world be if it were very easy to not pay people for there work without getting caught? What if graphic designers were never paid for their work because clients thought they were entitled to free graphic design? The only people who would continue to get paid were those violent criminals and mobsters who would send a VERY convincing bill collector. There is no typeface design mafia (thank goodness) so it is like taking candy from a baby. I guess taking candy from a baby is not a crime then but taking drugs from the mafia surely is. Oh, and there is no law against taking drugs from the mob so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about prosecution&ndash;you might not want to start your car though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nice read, but not convincing :) Free software (including fonts) are far from being driven as you make it look like, just look around and see how many free fonts are there and what percentage is corporate driven. I, myself, did all my font related work out of passion, just because I love it, the fact I sometimes get paid is always a &ldquo;later development&rdquo;, now people are using my fonts freely, are they &ldquo;passive dependants who take without giving back&rdquo;?, no, they certainly are not, they gave me many &ldquo;wows&rdquo; and &ldquo;thankyous&rdquo; that gave me more incentive to work, they gave me advices, corrections and suggestions that helped me improve it more and more, they convinced their employers to pay me to develop it more, they even paid from their pockets to financially support me. Now I did the opposite, I&rsquo;m using a completely free software stack that I didn&rsquo;t, directly, pay I cent for, am I a &ldquo;passive dependants who take without giving back&rdquo;? I hope I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else here, but if the only way to use computers is to help building a divided world where children are taught in schools not to help their friends because it is [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html|piracy]], a world that handing a CD to my neighbour is a [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html|theft]], world where I pay for things then I don&rsquo;t own because it is someone&rsquo;s precious [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html|IP]], then I&rsquo;d rather quit using computers, after all I spent the first 20 years of my life without computers and I think I can survive the rest without one.</p>
<p>It is a matter of principle, if you don&rsquo;t think drug smuggling is legitimate way to make a living, then I don&rsquo;t think you care much about drug dealers being upset of diminished revenues (well, back to not-so-well-perceived analogies, but at least I neither mentioned Hitler nor any other genocides).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Toad:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, can you agree that changes in technology have created a problem for typeface designers as well as the obvious benefits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh sure. We can take that statement even further&hellip;we can agree that changes in technology from the beginning of time has introduces huge benefits and huge problems for both creators and consumers of media.</p>
<p>I agree with pretty much all you say. There&rsquo;s no doubt that it&rsquo;s frustrating for those in this industry. But the reality is that it&rsquo;s changing, just as it always has. Some will adapt, some won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Netflix thrives, Blockbuster is entering bankruptcy. &lsquo;tis the cycle of industry.</p>
<p>My only nit-pick is trying to use analogies as there are a plethora of analogies for nearly every angle of the debate that we can toss back and forth ad nauseam. It&rsquo;s a fun game, but doesn&rsquo;t really address the issue directly.</p>
<p>Copying files without permission isn&rsquo;t the same as stealing a Ferrari and robbing starving kids nor is it the same as shiny happy bunnies and rainbows. ;)</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a gut reaction on Typophile (that is understandable) that unless you are 100% for DRM and life sentences for pirates, then you must be against the industry and are for economic anarchy.</p>

<p>Nobody here has been arguing for extensive technological barriers to sharing fonts, which is what I understand is the implication of the term &ldquo;DRM&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What has been advocated, and is now being implemented with WOFF is a &ldquo;garden wall&rdquo; that will let people who want to respect copyright what is copyrighted and of restricted legal use, and should not be copied for other uses. I guess those opposed to any copyright will also think this is a terrible idea, but it is going forward, and I&rsquo;m very happy about it.</p>

<p>Your argument has emotional appeal but some of the factual premises seem a little rosy-hued.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the age of metal type, typeface designers were more certain that those who used their typefaces would contribute financially to them so they could make enough of a living to continue designing typefaces.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Is that really true? Seems to me that typeface knockoffs have been around as long as typefaces. It&rsquo;s certainly not a digital-age phenomenon. Do you think Bauer / Paul Renner were happy about Spartan and Vogue? No, it diverted buyers who probably would&rsquo;ve bought Futura. Whole foundries have been built around cloning other designs. The only difference in the digital age is that the end user can do the cloning themselves, by making an illegal copy of the real font. But the effect is analogous.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As modern history has shown over and over, a person can only continue a career for exactly as long as it remains financially viable to do so.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Nobody has a right to make a living off of what they do. Corollary: some careers cease to be economically viable. Again, this is not a digital-age phenomenon or a creative-professional phenomenon (just ask the buggy-whip repairmen).</p>
<p>Who knows? Typeface design may eventually go obsolete as an economically rational activity. But after 20 years of digital fonts, the type industry in the aggregate seems pretty healthy (certainly, there are a lot more people getting paid to design fonts these days than there were when I started out).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->corporations with deep enough pockets who have a financial incentive to prop up the typeface-design industry by subsidizing the work they approve of … I don&rsquo;t see this as the positive alternative you do, because it takes the decision-making about which fonts will exist in the future out of the hands of designers and puts it in the hands of corporations … this seems a lot less like a utopia than a dystopia.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->huge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> catalyst for type design throughout history has been work directed by corporations. That hasn&rsquo;t changed in the digital age. Look at Adobe, AGFA, Monotype, and Linotype, which are big corporations in their own right (I know, they all merged, but even before that, they were big). Or look at the Font Bureau library or the Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones library &ndash; many of those fonts originated from custom jobs done for corporate clients in the publishing industry. They were not the product of designers &ldquo;design[ing] whatever they want&rdquo;. There are foundries whose output is more along those lines (e.g. Emigre). I&rsquo;m glad we have both kinds. But this &ldquo;dystopia&rdquo; you speak of has been responsible for keeping a lot of type designers employed, and resulted in a lot of nice fonts that didn&rsquo;t exist before. A type-design industry that was entirely driven by customers and designers would be, frankly, a lot smaller financially and a lot narrower creatively.</p>

<p>I know that was a peripheral comment, but it exmplifies the habit of misstating the law that runs through a lot of these discussions among type designers. False premises lead to false arguments and then false conclusions. The truth is out there &mdash; why not start with that?</p>

<p>I would not argue that no one ever stole typefaces before the digital age, only that copying a file is several orders of magnitude easier than either hauling off a case of metal or meticulously imitating someone else&rsquo;s work and casting it to create your own version. Since a digital file the size of a font can be copied in seconds, I&rsquo;m surprised anyone would think it was even remotely as easy to &ldquo;share&rdquo; typeface designs before the digital age, which seems to be your argument.</p>
<p>I also would not argue that anyone has a right to make a living off what they did, only that those of us not engaged in that career need to consider whether we want typeface designers to make a living. If we want there to be doctors, we should probably ensure that it&rsquo;s possible to make a living as a doctor; the same applies to typeface designers. The economy isn&rsquo;t just something that happens. It&rsquo;s something we make happen through our actions. If we want there to be professional typeface designers in the future, then in the present we should not personally act in ways that destroy the economic viability of that career. As an aside I&rsquo;m not sure there ever were dedicated professional buggy-whip repairmen; the obsolescence metaphor you&rsquo;re alluding to is usually about buggy-whip manufacturers.</p>
<p>I also would not say I didn&rsquo;t want corporations involved in the decisions about which typefaces get created, only that I don&rsquo;t want that to be the only economic option for typeface designers. I want there to be a thriving market in which anyone who is motivated and passionate enough and has the resources - both corporations and individuals - can find professional typeface designers to help them create new designs. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unreasonable to pay for typeface designs, why I don&rsquo;t agree with Khaled Hosny when he writes that those designs must necessarily be free but that making them free wouldn&rsquo;t destroy the industry because companies might later approach the typeface designers and offer to pay them. I don&rsquo;t doubt that that has worked for him, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want it to be the only model. If we did ban it for ideological reasons, I think as far as the typeface-design industry was concerned the results would be dystopic rather than utopic.</p>
<p>As for my post being emotional, counter-factual, and rosy-hued . . . well, even upon rereading it doesn&rsquo;t seem that way to me, but if it seemed that way to you then this wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time in human history that things seemed different to two different people. I&rsquo;m sure there is much in my post that could be improved - for example I should have written that I do support Mr. Hosny&rsquo;s right to create free fonts and I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s an active community supporting and sharing those fonts - and I like a good argument as much as the next fellow, but I prefer it when people argue with what I actually write.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Building on Aluminum&rsquo;s argument when he wrote &ldquo;Copying files without permission isn&rsquo;t the same as stealing a Ferrari and robbing starving kids nor is it the same as shiny happy bunnies and rainbows. ;)&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>I agree that sharing the files that define digital typefaces does indeed stand somewhere in between those extremes. I also agree that it is too easy in these discussions to polarize, as though instead of searching for the truth we are taking sides in a sporting event, and when we polarize we distort what we are supposed to be trying to understand.</p>
<p>Taking your request for nuance a little further, stealing a Ferrari is also somewhere between robbing starving kids and shiny happy bunnies and rainbows. It also isn&rsquo;t neutral, though, like eating lunch or taking a nap. It&rsquo;s bad, but it isn&rsquo;t as bad as stealing from the starving kids. Stealing from someone who has a thing, likes a thing, and uses a thing, but doesn&rsquo;t actually need that thing is different from stealing what people actually need to survive. They&rsquo;re both theft, but they aren&rsquo;t the same degree of crime.</p>
<p>When someone mass-produces things based on their own original designs, stealing one of their products is different still. Specifically, stealing a Ferrari from a Ferrari factory does less damage to the factory than stealing a Ferrari from a Ferrari owner does to the owner. It&rsquo;s not as bad because the Ferrari factory can make more Ferraris (conditionally - we&rsquo;ll come back to this), but the Ferrari owner may not be able to afford another Ferrari, or that particular Ferrari may have had special emotional value to them. Either way, it&rsquo;s easier for the factory to get another Ferrari than for the owner, because the owner can&rsquo;t make Ferraris but the factory can. Using the apple metaphor Khaled Hosny alluded to earlier, stealing an apple from a starving child is worse than stealing an apple from an adult who&rsquo;d planned to eat it for lunch, which is worse than stealing an apple from an apple orchard. The issue defining this scale is: how badly did our victim need that specific thing we took? The more badly they needed it, the more damage we&rsquo;ve done by helping ourselves to it.</p>
<p>However, only a thief will rationalize that committing a lesser crime counts as doing something good. Just because an apple orchard has more apples and can more easily replace the one we took, that still doesn&rsquo;t make it okay to steal from the orchard, because we do a different kind of damage to the orchard that the hungry child and the adult don&rsquo;t suffer - they don&rsquo;t have to make their living by selling apples. The child should be supported by its parents and community, and the adult by some other career, but the apple orchard needs to sell those apples to make enough money to keep growing apples. If enough people take the apples instead of pay for them, the orchard will go bankrupt, the grower will have to do something else for a living, and the land will (usually) be sold off for some other purpose.</p>
<p>That is, we&rsquo;re talking about two very different kinds of damage here. There is a damage that comes from depriving someone of a thing they need or want, and there is a different kind of damage that comes from depriving someone of the means to make a living. Granting Butterick&rsquo;s argument that no one has a right to make a living at what they do, nevertheless when we personally intervene in their lives to reduce their ability to make a living, that isn&rsquo;t the abstract forces of history judging their career as obsolete - that&rsquo;s us personally hurting them unnecessarily, but in a different way than the simple, direct deprivation of taking a thing from them. However we try to dress it up, it&rsquo;s economic sabotage.</p>
<p>Our problem in this digital age of typography is that sharing files is so easy that anyone can see that taking a copy of a digital file can&rsquo;t possibly count as depriving anyone of a thing they had - after all, they still have the file; we just took a copy of it. Zeroing out the deprivation damage gives people the rationalization they need to help themselves to any font files they can lay their hands on - regardless of the other form of damage they are doing, the economic sabotage.</p>
<p>This is the crux of the moral issue here. It&rsquo;s not enough not to hurt people in one obvious way. To be good people, we must refrain from hurting people in any unnecessary way.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s easy to copy the files does not give us moral permission to do so; it&rsquo;s also easy to steal candy from children, or to drive away a car if someone&rsquo;s left the keys in it. Just because copying a font file doesn&rsquo;t deprive them of their copy of the file, that does not give us moral permission to copy it; it&rsquo;s also easy to copy trade secrets if someone leaves them on their desk, or to copy someone&rsquo;s medical record if you come across it in a hospital, or their diary, or their logo or packaging style.</p>
<p>Aside from the legal issues of ownership, which clearly are not fully persuasive to some of us, there are moral issues of ownership that ought to be. When someone creates a typeface, they have more moral rights to that design than we do; they thought of it, they invested in it, they made it, they understand it, they care about it, and they want to share it with us, and all they ask in return is that we invest in them so they can go on making typefaces and that we don&rsquo;t sabotage them economically. If they want us to share the files and we do so, then that&rsquo;s free software as defined by the Free Software Foundation. If they want us to use the files but not to share them but we do anyway, then that&rsquo;s not free software, it&rsquo;s economic sabotage.</p>
<p>So where does sharing font files without the designer&rsquo;s permission fall on our scale of right and wrong?</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t as bad as taking a thing someone needs, nor as bad as taking a thing someone wants, but it&rsquo;s every bit as bad taking a product from a producer. Here&rsquo;s why. Even though it&rsquo;s harder for a Ferrari factory to produce another Ferrari or for an orchard to produce another apple than it is for a foundry to produce another copy of their font files, the economic sabotage of stealing a physical object is more restricted, because the person we share that stolen car or apple with is only going to use it, whereas some of the people we share the stolen font file with will doubtless share it with more people - the damage increases over time by increasingly driving down people&rsquo;s willingness to invest in the designer since more and more of them have his work for free. The increasing damage over time offsets the ease of replacement, so it&rsquo;s about on a par as far as the scale of the economic damage goes.</p>
<p>Sharing font files without permission is by no means neutral or good. It&rsquo;s bad, not the worst thing by far, but definitely a species of economic injury. Like all kinds of injury, it creates negative consequences that we suffer whether we want to or not, whether we recognize them or not, that result directly from our actions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this could be gauged with more precision and nuance, but at the moment that&rsquo;s my most careful take on the moral species of sharing font files without permission.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth. Your milage my vary and all the usual disclaimers and caveats.</p>

<p>While I agree that Mr Hosny and others who share his opinions certainly have right to make and download legitimate original free fonts, I don&rsquo;t think he has the right or entitlement to prevent those who choose to making a living selling fonts from doing so. Most people have a sense of honesty and integrity, they would feel guilty about performing acts which are either, criminal, unscrupulous, or even just of a dubious nature. What Mr Hosny and his ilk are doing is repeatedly giving support to notions that unlawful taking or sharing of commercial typefaces is not only normal and expected, but ethical and desirable. This is in effect propaganda. As per Joseph Goebbels&rsquo;s, &ldquo;If you say it loud enough and long enough, people will assume it must be true.&rdquo;
The effect on the typically honest person is to progressively dissolve the feeling of guilt and make &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo; typefaces which you have no right to, seem &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or even chic. 
During the Vietnam War, and I am sure all other wars, there were incidents of rape of village women.  There were guys not only doing it but rationalizing it as a patriotic duty&ndash;after all they were not humans, they were just &ldquo;Gooks&rdquo; and their husbands and brothers were probably &ldquo;The Enemy&rdquo;.  It was easy to do and extremely unlikely to bring punishment, therefore, if you could, you should. Dehumanizing Vietnamese women or decriminalizing unscrupulous acquisition of property not in your ethical domain may seem at opposite ends of the spectrum of immoral acts but none the less, they are BOTH immoral and illegal.  All of the rationalizing propaganda on earth will not change that fact.  It would be truly &ldquo;naive&rdquo; and self-serving to think otherwise. I am sure Mr Hosny and his like-minded band of thieves will respond as usual with either further rationalization to refute their criminal behavior or character assassination of those who think and speak to the contrary. It is the basic Rush Limbaugh technique&ndash;he always has the microphone and the airways so repeating the propaganda and dehumanizing the opposition is simple and profitable. Purveyors  of &ldquo;stealing type is OK&rdquo; are just another example of how low humanity can sink when the only persons they feel is human and has rights are themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Hosny&rsquo;s posts show that he is working according to a moral code and he has thought about the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. If we want to engage him in a discussion about whether there are additional moral factors he should be considering, we probably shouldn&rsquo;t introduce Goebbels, Limbaugh, or wartime rapists into the discussion. Those examples are too extreme; they will tend to add too much heat and not enough light. The points underlying them are worth making - like the problem that people tend to follow common examples, even bad ones, which can normalize otherwise unacceptable behavior - but they need cooler, clearer examples to advance the discussion.</p>

<p>I am so sorry, Rick. I won&rsquo;t let it happen again, even if I don&rsquo;t think Mr Hosny, et al, are the least bit interested in &ldquo;engaging in a discussion&rdquo;, he just wants to &ldquo;have the Conch&rdquo; or the mike all to himself so he can discredit the opposition with innuendo and repeat ad nauseam his mantra that type stealing is OK because it is just not half as bad as baby starving.

<p>You are mixing up three ideas that should stay distinct:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The value of copyright law in the abstract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The choice of a consumer to use noncopyrighted software instead of copyrighted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The choice of a consumer to use copyrighted software illegally.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think copyright is a flawed system, fine. If you want to use noncopyrighted software as an expression of that principle, fine. But you can&rsquo;t say that principle gives you (or others) a basis to break the law. That&rsquo;s just a rationalization.</p>
<p>Even free-software guys like Richard Stallman support copyright. Their major objection is the ever-increasing term of copyright protection (a legitimate concern). Past that, they support free software because they think it&rsquo;s a superior way to develop certain types of software (and the market has agreed).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->both copyrights and patents on mere ideas (like software patents) have been holding us back and are, generally, doing harm than good<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In the US, copyrights and patents &ldquo;on mere ideas&rdquo; don&rsquo;t exist. If you start with a false premise, you can prove anything.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Mr. Hosny,</p>
<p>I do agree - and I think you&rsquo;ll even find a surprising number of attorneys agree - that something is wrong with our copyright and patent laws. The original intent was as you say to protect and encourage creative endeavors, but we all know of cases where those laws are instead used to suppress creative endeavors - for example buying up the rights to competing innovations and then shelving them. It is ironic that these laws can been perverted to do just the opposite of what they were intended to do.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it does not follow that no one ever uses the laws for their original, intended purpose. On the contrary, plenty of creative people use copyright laws to protect their ability to do creative work. The use of civil disobedience to challenge unjust laws is perfectly legitimate, but only if it is used selectively, against those who are causing the problems. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. broke laws carefully and selectively. If you instead always condone sharing files, you are punishing everyone indiscriminately. That doesn&rsquo;t count as legitimate civil disobedience because it isn&rsquo;t targeted enough.</p>
<p>Just because our current legal framework is broken, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the prior situation was any kind of paradise we ought to be striving to return to; it was worse. The laws were passed in the first place because the original, unprotected situation in America resulted in widespread theft and deceit that led people to wonder why they should ever both creating anything since it was only going to be stolen from them, with the thieves taking credit for the invention. If all we do is ignore or repeal the copyright and patent laws, we are not replacing a bad situation with a good one; we are replacing the current bad situation with the original bad one. If we want a good situation, we should accept neither alternative and push for something different, a third alternative that will truly protect and encourage creativity. I would love to discuss what that might be.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d like clarification on something you wrote. When you wrote</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody denied them their moral right, and I don&rsquo;t think file sharer who remove author credits from the files they share, which what their moral right is all about&rdquo;</p>
<p>are you saying removing the author credit is a good thing or a bad thing? It wasn&rsquo;t quite clear, and it makes a big difference to how I read your post.</p>

<p>The crowd might want Barrabas, but I think you and I agree that what hope there may be for humanity&rsquo;s future lies in helping one another work through these kinds of moral dilemmas. Justice is not easy to define, and once defined proves not easy to bring about, nor when it fails are we clear on how to make things better, but the struggle to understand it, bring it about, and repair it is a worthy task.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Caution, Sermon by an Atheist to follow:</p>
<p>You must have moral fiber in order to weave the cloth of Justice. If all that you have, you have stolen from others, you have no self-worth. If you loose what you have stolen, you only need steal it again (something in your comfort zone anyway). If you have some value within yourself and can generate things others may value, then you value the things generated by others and are willing to make exchanges of your creation for those of others.</p>
<p>Once upon a time:
Through the sweat of your brow, you could grow food and make shelter for yourself, make clothes to keep you warm, stand watch to keep your family safe, find medicine to cure your ills, teach your children how to go about fulfilling their lives, build a fire to cook, and every other task that life requires—you can do all of these things by yourself for yourself but this is a very hard life and you may not be very good at most of the things. Otherwise, if you are a very good farmer, you can trade your food for someone else’s well made clothes or medicine. In this way, everyone can find at least one task of value to others that they excel at and concentrate on that alone to be even better and more efficient at doing it. You can trade your service or product for something else that you need by exchange. The peoples of the world have done this since the beginning of time, some in a very basic way and some in a complicated network of more obscure ways (as exist in our modern society today). It is more complex that the ancient times and our “needs” have a fuzzy definition—our “wants” still exceed our needs, though. We therefore have odd professions like Movie Actor” football player, lawyer, urologist, school teacher, policeman, structural engineer, and even typeface designer, that were unheard of before civilization took place. 
The point is, everyone can find a means of support that they are good enough at to be a means of exchange for others. It seems I have left out one important category that has existed since the beginning of time. The modern day version is much adapted to modern life and very adept at his ancient skill—even if the ways and means have greatly evolved. The problem is that nobody from outside that group wants anything to do with them or certainly not be a party of their trade.  This group of people are the ones that produce absolutely nothing of benefit to others, they are like a parasite that clings to your intestinal walls and secretly absorbs all of their needs and wants from your body with either permission or your request. These are the thieves, con men, takers who have nothing to give or to trade. They survive by making other people miserable and are proud enough about it to think they are entitled to do so under some code which only they have invented to rationalize their existence.
True, some are less heinous than others and only prey on the greedy or, at best, naive hosts to extract their pound of flesh. Still, even the least of them is not a contributer, a maker, a doer, a helper, or even an entertainer. Perhaps we should just pity their lack of ability to contribute and allow them to continue their life-long attachment to our innards and allow them to drink our life’s blood until we faint from lack of nourishment. Of course we have to work twice as hard so that they not need to work at all, but, that is just the price you pay for your fellow man’s self-proclaimed right to continue unabated.</p>

<p>I dunno about America, but here we had a thousand years or so of creative work and civilisation with no copyright laws of any kind, and every one was allowed to copy whatever he have access to and the world did not collapse, and I believe it was the case for most, if not all, human civilisation. so I don&rsquo;t believe copyright is the only motivate for people to innovate, or even a major one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On a practical note, I have to say that effectively the harder it is to get the font for free the more likely it is a person will pay for it.
Yes good marketing and great quality will affect sales a lot more than policing and hunting down illegal download sites, but if the action against piracy is centralized (through foundries or retailers) it may prove to be productive and efficient and actually return more money than is spent on it. A number of schemes can be executed to drive potential users from the pirate websites into the legitimate retailers. Like for example flooding the Torrent market with huge torrents of what is seemingly great quality fonts and making sure they rank high on Google search and then once the huge ZIP file is on your hard drive BOINK it&rsquo;s a bunch of rubbish. They actually did that when The Simpsons movie was first released into theaters, all the downloads of that movie were rubbish so I gave up. This is only one example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with Khaled that creativity has little to do with Copyright. But Copyright is just a fair way to financially compensate the creator. It&rsquo;s not about moral rights, it&rsquo;s about financial rights.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Khaled,</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification. It reinforces my earlier argument that other posters shouldn&rsquo;t be dismissing you as a thief and a pirate, because you have a moral code, so there is a basis for discussion. It is too easy when people don&rsquo;t understand you to make assumptions about your motivations; after they do that, you&rsquo;re fighting an uphill battle to be understood because they will filter everything you say or write through their expectations about your motivations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the antagonism has been coming from in this thread. As far as I can tell, no one on this thread is opposed to the existence of a free-software community. They&rsquo;re opposed to having their own software &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; without their permission - and they read your comments as though you were promoting that.</p>
<p>To help a step further, if you explained more than once on this thread that you don&rsquo;t support breaking the law (and I believe you), I and most of the other posters missed it. We misunderstood what your wrote and thought that was precisely what you support. With that mistake uncovered and removed from the equation, the discussion becomes more interesting because we can more clearly explore our real differences of opinion instead of responding to our mistaken impressions of each other.</p>
<p>More later.</p>

<ol>
<li>Instructing the people about all the hard work you have put on designing your font.</li>
<li>Then, releasing the font for free.</li>

</ol>
<p>Not just releasing for free.. education first.. a powerfull resource.
If people is aware and value your work, they will support you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you run a business, you have losses; some are inevitable. A business can survive with losses. Truckers have rising highway tolls. Retailers have higher taxes and utilities. Yet there are still stores and trucks.</p>
<p>File sharing is a type of loss that can&rsquo;t be stopped, slowed down or measured. Complaining about file sharing may have a positive effect or may have a negative effect. Does complaining help you get more work done? Maybe. Maybe some font designers like to take a break to blow off steam about file sharing to help them work harder.</p>

I do a variation on your choices. I only complain when confronted with someone who insists that file sharing is OK and even desirable and then only if, at that moment I am either hungry, tired, frustrated, or annoyed.  Then I spew (as I have done here) and just go back to work hoping enough honest people still exist in the world willing to pay for fonts that I can pay my bills ;-)</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was hungry, tired, frustrated, AND annoyed so my spew was much longer and persistent than ever. Please forgive my sermon and venting&ndash;now back to work!</p>
