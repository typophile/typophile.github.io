  body: "Nice one.\r\nA few comments:\r\n\r\nR: The upper part seems odd/too squarish.\r\nS,O,C,
    etc.: Your rounded letters definetely need more overshoot, if there's any at all
    yet?\r\nS: seems much more rounded at the sides compared to C,O, G which have
    long vertical/straight sides\u2026\r\nA: could do with a bit opening up of the
    inner white space\r\nQ: very nice, but i'd think about an alternative because
    it's going to be the only letter with a descender, and \u2013 presuming it's caps
    only \u2013 a designer would most likely want to use your face with very little
    line spacing, but if a line contains a Q you're in for a surprise, as your picture
    already illustrates. I'd think about a Q form without a Descender, which might
    be a hard nut to crack \u2013 maybe you could try somethiung inside the white
    space of the Q. And you could still have your version above supplied as an alternative.
    Honestly, I as a graphic designer, would want to use that one as tight as it gets
    both horizontally and vertically.\r\nAll in my very humble opinion of course."

  body: "I think that you could try to improve the overshoots of the rounded structures.
    Without this optical adjusts they looks like a little smaller than the other letters.
    See the letter \"G\" in the word \"ZINGER\" for example.\r\n\r\nAnyway, nice forms!\r\n\r\ne.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys for your comments. The original letterforms are actually all
    common sizes and circular forms have squarer edges (see attached). I may supply
    the Squarer S as an alernate letter along with a few others.I totally understand
    with the overshoot fo the rounder letters and will look to improve this in my
    next progression. Nice comment on the Q Franz, I realise when I typeset it exactly
    the same problem - it looks good as a letterform on its own, but not when typeset.\r\n\r\nCheers[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letterforms.jpg]"

      flat/squashed in the bowl. As with the B too.\r\nZ: Perhaps the leading stroke
      could be shorter so the fella doesn't look like he's going to topple.\r\nI like
      squid juice."
