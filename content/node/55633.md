  threads - I'd very much like to hear any thoughts or impressions on these two versions
  of the mark. \r\n\r\nIt is for a logo <em>and</em> an application icon for a file
  backup software called Bvckup. The mark is based on the V and it is meant to resemble
  flipped over A as well as incorporate a form of an arrow indicating a motion (of
  either stashing the files or recovering them).\r\n\r\nThoughts ? Good/bad/blah/interesting/unremarkable/etc
  ?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvckup-2-b_5257.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvckup_4998.png]\r\n"

    though it's pointing down in the negative space, not up.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Ha, a \"V1\". Interesting, never saw it before you mentioned it. In the Serif
    thread someone said a \"fishing hook\", which was spot on, but also didn't occur
    to me at all before that.\r\n\r\nFor the second version I hoped that since the
    arrow is enclosed, it would refer to \"stashing\" of the data. Also the downward
    motion should associate with affixing or bolting something down, which in turn
    refers to the permanency, reliability and such. Not sure if the mark evokes any
    of these associations at all though...\r\n\r\nIn any case, I thought I'd post
    the full set. I personally like 2a, 1a, 3b and 1d, in this order. \r\n\r\nThe
    triangle based versions (esp. 1D) is a rendering of the \"shield\" concept, but
    again not sure if that's evident.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jc-marks_4169.png]"

  body: "This is tricky - how much do you want the 'A' to read vs the 'V'?\r\n\r\nI
    really like 1a and 3b for their blends of 'A', arrow, and 'V'. I'd say 1a is my
    favourite.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    says 'medical' to me, either stethoscope or fallopian tubes. C3 is just bad.\r\n\r\nB2
    is strong but I see no connection to your themes...\r\n\r\nDesign is simple and
    will work well at icon size."
