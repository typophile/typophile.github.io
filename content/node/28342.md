  font that I thought was a Greek form of Monotype Ehrhardt.  I am not so sure about
  that now, but I have got an image of the font from the penguin edition of the complete
  works of John Milton.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what this font is and where I might
  be able to get my hands on it?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It looks like the Baskerville Greek from Linotype, based mainly on the alpha
    and Kappa. I am using the Greek type section in the back of the FontBook. I can't
    see any differences between the sample and this font, but it wouldn't be the first
    time I thought that erroneously.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Baskerville was a very common font for Greek. It certainly would hve seen
    broad usage in religious material. This one seems to have a larger xheight than
    the older ones I have seen. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Thanks for the information.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether this form of Baskerville
    Greek is adapted for Polytonic Greek.  I searched for Baskerville Greek and what
    I found seems to be Monotonic Greek.\r\n\r\nAlso, after looking at all of the
    characters of the Baskerville Greek that I find online, I notice that the minuscule
    psi of this font (not found in the image that I included) looks like that from
    the Symbol font.  I wonder whether the Greek used in my book actually borrowed
    some characters from other fonts.\r\n"
