  to identity. Clearly it is a custom lettered piece, but was wondering what the base
  typeface might be \u2014\_akin to Garamond / Garamond Condensed...\r\n\r\nThe source
  is 1950s era statement from a Derbyshire printer (UK)...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, any
  help is much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"
