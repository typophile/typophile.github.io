body: "This signage for the Deutsche Schule in Richmond UK was carved into limestone
  by Tom Perkins, a skilled craftsman who specializes in stone letter carving, so
  I believe the letterforms are probably unique. Nonetheless, I'd appreciate any suggestions
  from my fellow typophiles for any fonts or designs I could explore that bear some
  resemblance to the proportions and serifs of these letters, especially the 'S',
  'C' and 'D'- I'm really taken with those curves! Many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n

  body: It is very close to a representation I have in a book to Berlings, designed
    in '64 by Karl-Erik Forsberg. BUT when I went to Linotype to check it out it looks
    very little like the image I recalled, or the representation I have. Sorry. I
    could scan this if you wish.

  body: Thanks for all the suggestions. Forsberg's designs are new to me- they seem
    to be the most likely source.
