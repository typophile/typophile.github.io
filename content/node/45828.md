  for and I\u2019m looking for a fresh looking type for the headlines. I really like
  SoHo from Sebastian Lester. But I\u2019m not 100% sure. What do you think? Do you
  have some alternatives or suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nalainch"

  body: It has a good range. What sort of depth/range to the local museums have? I
    can't see SoHo for a Turner show.

    music and visual arts but mostly about cinema, music and also TV.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n-
