  ([[http://www.typophile.com/node/79817|which]] I still haven't finished), I have
  not been able to define my opinion of free vs. commercial licensing. \r\n\r\nTherefore
  I have created this post; I'd really like to boil down the main arguments for selling
  a font/giving it for free. Does it depend from where you want to license it? Is
  it better to sell only the \"Regular\" font and give the rest of the family for
  free? What is the best option, if there's any?\r\n\r\nSurely there are some posts
  linked with this discussion, but I couldn't find many...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLex"

    version will appreciate the value-added benefit of the free versions, but freeloaders
    won't buy the Regular version if the freebies are available. And it's not unusual
    for freeloaders to expect technical support for their non-purchases: recently,
    I had to walk a newbie through the entire process of downloading, unzipping and
    installing a freeware font of mine--a total of six emails--and I regularly get
    requests for added features or expanded families. Freeware fonts are a good way
    to develop your skills on a (relatively) low-risk basis, but providing goods to
    the hordes of moochers out there can be more trouble than it's worth."

  body: "I want advice for each of these two positions:\r\n\r\n- You want to grow
    in popularity as a designer; it is your first face, but want to keep the attention
    that is produced publishing it for further typefaces. This face intends to introduce
    the subsequent ones, and to focus that attention. About how much money you make
    from it, you don't care.\r\n- You just plan to do one single typeface and think
    your design is good enough to give it a price. You want to find the best strategy
    for the highest benefit. These strategies vary from setting an overall \"optimal\"
    price to selling just a few fonts, and giving the rest for free.\r\n\r\nIs there
    anything that I may be not considering?\r\n\r\n@Nick\r\nThanks, I didn't think
    of that problem of giving your fonts for free. I'll bear that in mind. But do
    you really think freeloaders won't buy the Regular version (speaking now about
    a book typeface, not display)? It's the starting point for the rest of the family,
    or am I getting it wrong?..."

    learn. Nor is anyone else in need to be graced by such a gift.\r\nReconsider *why*
    you are doing this.\r\n\r\nI do not know of any eminent typeface designer who
    gives just away the fruits of his hard labour. Maybe, you\u2019ll become the first?\r\n\r\nOffering
    *some* single fonts (out of larger families) for free can be a sensible means
    of marketing font products, though."

    \r\n\r\nI just wanted to know what have been your experiences with selling your
    fonts and to incite some discussion about why would anyone, like you say, Andreas,
    be willing to give his/her fonts for free. I have recently noticed people is following
    more or less that direction.\r\n\r\n@frank <cite>Do you want to make a living
    of type design? Do you think type designers in general should be able to make
    a living of it? </cite>\r\nI'm really a hobbyist right now, not an experienced
    designer, nor am I studying design. Perhaps I do want it, but i'm still in my
    way to find that out. It's for my lack of experience that I've asked for your
    advice.\r\nI think your second question is rhetorical."

    fonts are worth paying for. If type designers don't think so, well what then?

  body: To what extent do you think Jos Buivenga has made a good decision by giving
    many of his fonts for free? Do you think this fact is justifiable or is it just
    an aberration to type designers dedication in general? (Maybe Jos himself could
    give us an explanation...)
