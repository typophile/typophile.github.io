body: At first I thought this was Serif Gothic &#40;I believe it has the tiny serifs,
  but it&#39;s hard to tell from this scan from an old business card&#41;, but the
  different style lower case &#34;a&#34; among other things says it&#39;s something
  else. Any ideas?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48476.gif"

    Gothic</a>. Of the revivals I looked at on myfonts, the Spiece Graphics was the
    most accurate, but the E&#43;F is decent too.
