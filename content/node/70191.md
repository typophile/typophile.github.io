  body: Poetica comes in different styles, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/poetica_chancery_4/?&sample_text=C%20A%20L%20D%20E%20R%20I%20N%20I&acs_pt=32&update=0">Poetica
    4</a> has upright roman caps, although it looks thinner and the C is different,
    that's why I'm thinking this is a tweaked Poetica 4. But I could be wrong.

  body: "Thanks for your help, barthak. :-)\r\n\r\nI am actually looking for a font
    that strongly recalls Latin, Roman history.\r\nI am working on a project of a
    logo for an Italian certified tourist guide. The font should recall ancient Italian
    origins, dating back to 7th century B.C. onwards, but in general the Roman empire
    era.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions in this respect would be greatly appreciated.\r\n "
