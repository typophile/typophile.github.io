  a page that displays photos from parties, has a calendar of the ones coming, etc..).
  their url is <a href=\"http://www.usgang.ch\" target=\"_blank\">usgang.ch</a>. its
  pretty big already.\r\n\r\nthey recently changed their logotype from impact (...)
  to helvetica neue. well, they wanted something very \"normal\". and i think it works
  for them, its ok. the agency chose helvetica, i wouldnt have, but hey.. in the end
  its not my own business.\r\n\r\nbut for all their ads & stuff, they now also use
  helvetica neue.. and i think thats just not good for their image. so i want to propose
  them (for free, he's my brother after all) some other fonts. ehm, i dont mean i
  will deliver the fonts to them, i'll just make a short presentation about other
  possibilities :)\r\n\r\n<strong>so: im looking for MODERN, but still corporate sans
  serif faces. they shouldnt be too far away from helvetica (i.e. not dax). could
  you list some possible alternatives? THANKS!</strong>"

  body: "I must say that Neue Helvetica does seem to work well with their site and
    appropriately feels very, well... Swiss.\r\n\r\nAre you proposing another sans
    to work in conjunction with their existing logo in Neue Helvetica? If so, there
    could be loss of continuity that helps in the visual balance they now have.\r\n\r\nChanging
    the typefaces to something very similar to Helvetica doesn't make much sense to
    me either, if the only reason is to be \"different.\"\r\nBecause there is a strong
    Swiss style to their identity, I could only advise to \"keep it in the country\"
    so to speak.\r\n\r\nIMHO, one of Adrian Frutiger's type styles might work yet
    retain the look of \"Swiss design\".\r\n\r\nHere are three families that are NOT
    look-alikes of Helvetica, and range from different to very different than Helvetica:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/95-black/testdrive.html?s=usgang.ch&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Avenir</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/65-bold/testdrive.html?s=usgang.ch&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Frutiger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/vectora/lh-75-bold/testdrive.html?s=usgang.ch&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Vectora</a>.\r\n\r\nYou will definitely need a type family with
    a range of weights, but if you want the web site text face to be consistent with
    the \"new look\" then there are very limited possibilities due to the small range
    of imbedded browser fonts. All of these issues are to be considered.\r\n\r\nYou
    will probably need to create several test renditions of ads and catalogue pages
    to even convince yourself that it works.\r\n"

  body: "norbert, no, im not speaking about another logo redesign. they dont want
    that and i can very well understand it. BUT they use so much type-based flash-ads,
    etc.. on their site, and its just a shame that they always use helvetica - i think.\r\n\r\nmaybe
    i was a bit unclear, probably, the word \"corporate\" isnt \"open\" enough: im
    looking for things different to helvetica: no univers, no frutiger. but at the
    same time, not as \"strange\" as dax.. maybe meta? something more natural, with
    more heart than helvetica.. but still familiar, nothing too strange.\r\n\r\navenir
    could work, thanks for that one."

  body: "You could use the Type Navigator on fontshop.com: http://typenav.fontshop.com/main.asp.
    Just click on the attributes you think would apply to Helvetica and see what choices
    come up. Only from the FontFont library, but that may still be too many.\r\n\r\nCheck
    out FF Plus and FF Zwo, both more in the humanist (i.e. Frutiger) vain, but thus
    more useful and less overused.\r\n\r\n<cite>Not one person (other than you) is
    saying \u201COh my god they are using Helvetica Neue\u201D</cite>\r\nThat, with
    respect, is not the point. If that were relevant, there would only be half a dozen
    typefaces, one for each distinct category. We\u2019re talking about supporting
    a brand here. Type is visible language, and if that company has its own style,
    appearance, language, surely that also needs to be expressed visually. Especially
    as they may well have competition. What you remember about a company or product
    is never a precise recollection of facts (\"they use Pantone 205 and Neue Helvetica...\"),
    but a much more succint recollection. just like we remember a person. Every detail
    adds up, and in order to control your appearance, you need to look at every aspect.

    body: "I was very suprised to see Erik in Typophile, but at the same time, a designer
      is always a person, a creative and curious person ;)\r\nI have to agree with
      your comment, but specially with the aspect of the complexity of setting type.
      One single face has so many forms in his own family that you can\xB4t always
      explore the capabilities within a family. It reminds me of a computer software:
      you can say you work well with a program, but it's always relative, from 30%
      to 90% of it's capabilities. How can it be measured? Anyway, I have never drawn
      a typeface so far, but the offsprings of typography alone make me busy. The
      way history, art and communication touch each other through type and typography
      gives me matter enough to get lost and in love.\r\nI admire your work. I work
      hard to learn new things about this, almost like an obsession. People who talk
      about \"fonts\" can only se the surface of this fantastic world, and it's hard
      for me to talk to someone who understands...\r\nRomantic speech? Perhaps. I
      just think typography has everything to do with human. Don't you?"
