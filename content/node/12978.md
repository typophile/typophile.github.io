    no? I mean they're just the kind of guys in the position to commission a font.

    authorities anyway. The thing is, it''s a frequent typeface in Belgium, I''d be
    surprised if this is commisioned. And the Swiss use it too. '

    dutch version. \r\nI just looked at it, but I don\xB4t think that it has any info
    about what fonts they use. It does have a nice collection of the different belgian
    traffic signs."

  body: "I tried to look up some info about the swiss signage font and this is what
    I found\r\n\r\n\"In 2003, the Swiss authorities decided to replace all traffic
    signs in Switzerland (which used to use the VSS font) with a variant of Frutiger
    known as ASTRA-Frutiger. All new signs will be in Frutiger and old signs will
    take around a decade to be completely replaced with Frutiger signs. The reason
    for this is that Frutiger is considered far more legible than the previous font,
    which was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. \"\r\n\r\non this website  http://frutiger.biography.ms/\r\n\r\nSo
    if you\xB4re sure that the Belgian signage font is the same as the swiss, than
    you have your answer.\r\n"
