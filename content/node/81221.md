body: "Need some help Identifying  this font:\r\n\r\nhttp://pages.uoregon.edu/ppederso/woodsanssmaller.jpg\r\n\r\nIt's
  from the letterpress lab at the university of oregon. It is 15 pica sans serif.
  \ It is not labeled, and it bares no foundry stamp or company insignia.  It is most
  likely older than 1965, and could be as old as 1900.  \r\n\r\nIt only exists in
  caps, although there are a few varying figures. (two types of A's, etc.) I tried
  to pick the figures with a similar grain pattern, the thought being that they would
  be of the safe shipment of type. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that this font has not been
  digitized, but any help you guys can offer would be amazing!"
