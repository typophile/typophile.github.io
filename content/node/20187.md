  is to close. This is what I received:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the Type Museum
  have taken the decision this week to  \r\nCLOSE and disperse the museum due to lack
  of funding.\r\n\r\nThese unique collections <http://www.typemuseum.org/> <http://
  \r\nwww.typemuseum.org/> spanning the evolution of type design and  \r\nmanufacture
  will be split up and the majority put into storage -  \r\nunlikely to see the light
  of day again.\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this email because you have previously expressed
  \ \r\nyour interest in, and support for the Type Museum. We need your help  \r\nurgently
  if we are save the Type Museum as a working resource for the  \r\nfuture. Apologies
  if you have received any cross postings.\r\n\r\nA meeting is scheduled to launch
  a Type Museum Society campaign to  \r\nensure a working future for the collections.\r\n18:30
  on Wednesday 24 May at the Type Museum, 100 Hackford Road SW9 0QU\r\n\r\nAll welcome.
  We need every kind of active support if we are to succeed.\r\n\r\nIf you are able
  to come along, or have any other time, ideas (or  \r\nmoney!) to offer please let
  us know at: <mailto:  \r\ntypemuseumsociety@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nThank you in anticipation\r\n\r\nTim
  Martin\r\n\r\nfor the Type Museum Society\r\ntypemuseumsociety@gmail.com"

  body: "I heard that this was sent out prematurely. \r\n\r\nAccording to Allan Haley,
    \"The British Museum of Science owns much of the hardware in the Type Museum and
    there was meeting between the principals of both museums last night. So far, the
    results of that meeting have not been made known.\"\r\n\r\nI hope things are resolved
    in a way which in the very least allows for those interested to be able to have
    continued access for research.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for posting this in support. Trustee Chairman Nicolas Barker has
    asked me to circulate the following clarification.\r\n\r\n\"The facts are that
    as the Museum has insufficient funds to cover its running costs, it is legally
    obliged to close while its trustees explore other options for keeping it going.
    When this process is complete, a public announcement will be made\".\r\n\r\nThe
    first meeting of the Type Museum Society took place at the Museum last Wednesday,
    well attended on a wet and windy night at almost no notice. 30 people left their
    contact details, a group will liase with the trustees. A second meeting will take
    place tomorrow Wednesday 31.05.2006 18:30 to carry the campaign forward. Many
    people have signed up online at http://groups.google.com/group/typemuseumsociety
    Where a digest of messages of support can be read. There's another two days worth
    to be added!\r\n\r\nOn Allan Haley's quote - The terms of acquisition of the elements
    of the collections vary. His point truly refers to the Monotype Corporation machine
    composition and matrix making collections. The Stephenson Blake and older hand-foundry
    materials would largely transfer in rights to the V&A. The DeLittle Wood Type
    Collection may prove to be still partly owned by the surviving Mr Delittle. The
    materials acquired from the former Clowes Museum & the Austen Composition collection
    both of great type language importance may have other safeguards built in (or
    not). This is only if the Type Museum fails as an entity in its own right and
    the collections cannot be kept accessibly together.\r\n\r\nThe principal concern
    is having gathered these materials and begun to see the profound educational value
    of having the processes side by side it is this very synergy that is at risk.\r\n\r\nThe
    staff were laid off last week. And I am receiving communications that indicate
    that the Museum is closing to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Museum on a shoestring has
    been working really hard to build a new purposeful and credible plan for the future
    - it needs all the support; and publicity it can get in a renewed drive for funding
    to put it on a firm foundation. For Type\u2019s sake !! These collections are
    without equal and represent - in or close to working condition - the evolution
    of type technologies."

  body: If anyone can help us get some journalists interested in writing up the  real
    threat of losing these materials and resources - please pass them on. We now have
    a domain http://www.typemuseumsociety.org/ and a very modest site at the moment
    - just an anchor point. But if some of you haven't been inside the vault at the
    Type Museum recently you may like to follow the Typographic Treasure link.
