  body: I agree with Yves about it being hand-lettered, but you might find <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/charlesborges/sarahscript.shtml"
    target="_blank">Sarah Script</a> from Letterhead Fonts or <a href="http://www.unifonts.com/intropag/g_intro.htm"
    target="_blank"> Grafia Script</a> from Unifonts as pretty acceptable substitutes.
