body: "Kudos to Kate Moss for having her own font... Every super model should have
  her/his own typeface, just as every one-person \"celebrity brand\" should. But,
  it shouldn't be released to the public when the design feels like a draft version.\r\n\r\nI
  can imagine the brand brief describing the need for a typeface that matches Moss'
  anemic and unnatural look, in which case, maybe this design fits the brief. There
  are just too many problems to mention, and this post would become a mean-spirited
  critique. See it for yourself -- it just doesn't hold up even under the most basic
  scrutiny.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/kate-moss-the-brand/\"

  Moss typeface designed circa 2007)\r\n\r\nYou probably remember Paul Barnes' much
  more successful design of Bj\xF6rk's typeface for her Pagan Poetry album in 2005.
  That font was available for download for free (and still may be <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=pagan_poetry\">free
  at DaFont.com</a>). However, the work for Pagan Poetry felt much more finished,
  even though it has a lot of the negative qualities of free fonts -- too oft repeated
  shapes and awkward characters forced into artificial compliance. But, overall, the
  Pagan Poetry face works, especially in the context of 2 words, and not a typeface
  meant for long text.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=pagan_poetry\"

    Barnes was paid to do it, right?\r\nSo it's not exactly a \"free\" font in the
    useful sense.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    funny,  but the original Alexey Brodovitch sample has some quirks in the printing,

  body: "Dear Joe,\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just because I'm English but I don't find Kate
    Moss to be odd looking or anemic at all. Yes she's slender but quite average looking
    really, and that's why she's such a good model! I can imagine myself wearing a
    lot of the clothes she wears if only I had thousands of quid to buy them. Perhaps
    I'm not paying good enough attention but I haven't seen mention anywhere of a
    whole typeface being made for Kate, just this logo which I find quite cute and
    VERY Kate and I don't understand why so many people have piled on to hate it so
    much, particularly men. I'm going to assume that you're not a transvestite, so
    you're not really in the target market for Kate's fab new brand are you? I'd kill
    to look good in the hotpants but I'm quite pleased with the tunic dress I waited
    on queue all night for."

    steel</a> face and realize: It was art directed by Peter Saville. By his mere
    presence in this project it <em>is</em> fashion. If we don't get it now, we will
    eventually.\r\nIn that sense this is as close as design gets to art; not relying
    on inherent qualities, it will become art/fashion by context. Not that I think
    the logo isn't nice \u2013 I do. Now stop sucking in those cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u0192\r\n"

  body: "Nigella, I'm not an 11 year old, but I've designed for them. I'm not a mom,
    but I've designed for moms. I am a designer and I've designed for designers (probably
    the most fun, and most challenging at the same time). A designer worth any salt
    should have an ability to step outside him/herself and view something objectively.
    \r\n\r\nFor the record I do think Peter Saville's work is very interesting. I
    also agree that fashion is fickle, fleeting, and ephemeral, but it doesn't have
    to be weakly executed."

    It's almost as mean-spirited <em>not</em> to mention what's wrong, no?\r\n\r\nFrom

    of her playing around with children in which she looks actually very natural and
    comfortable in her (quite skinny) naked body.\r\nAnd then there is this logo which
    seems completely geometrical, defunct of charm, a clumsy redrawing of a bad copy
    of a Didone of some sort... To me it doesn't seem particularly fashionable or
    trendy or stylish, just awkward. \r\n\r\nI think she deserves better! \r\n\r\n\r\nGoodness\u2014Truth\u2014Beauty"
