  fonts, in Microsoft programs like Word & PowerPoint, is there a way to BOTH have
  your fonts show up on the list AND be style linked. \r\n\r\nIE: Your font list would
  show Times, Times Italic, Times Bold, Times Bold Italic, AND you would be able to
  select Times and hit the Italic or Bold style linking button and have it connect
  to that. \r\n\r\nIm not sure if it can be done, and thought maybe if it couldn't
  with a standard font set, you can stly link the four \"standard\" fonts, and ALSO
  include a seperate font \"Times Bold\", \"Times Italic\", and \"Times Bold Italic\"
  that are formatted as singles. So there would be duplicate files for some. \r\n\r\nAm
  I making sense? Let me know if you'd like clarification.\r\n\r\n"

    got the sense that most people thought that the way things worked on Windows was
    good thing. I didn''t find any information that would disagree with Paul. '

  body: "I think it is debatable. \r\n\r\nBy hiding all but the primary font, your
    font menus are more efficient, but it's not always obvious which weight you will
    get when you \"bold\" a font. If the bold weight is actually called \"Bold\" then
    there's no problem. In larger families however, you may also have plain/bold links
    with Light/Semibold, Light/Black, or whatever, depending on the family. If you
    want, say, Helvetica Black, you have to figure out which lighter font it's paired
    with. You may not even know you are using Helvetica Black--you may think it is
    Helvetica Light Bold.\r\n\r\nThe Mac scheme makes for longer font menus, but at
    least you know exactly what fonts are available at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe best font
    selection system I have seen is InDesign's. It sort of combines the best of both
    worlds. And I think it works the same on both platforms."

    in separate fields.
