  book containing the Font Aid IV submissions. The book is now available through Lulu.com:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/coming-together-font-aid-iv/6553234\r\n\r\nI
  ordered a copy last week and I'm really impressed with it. The cost is $25 and all
  profits will go to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone
  for your help and support!"
