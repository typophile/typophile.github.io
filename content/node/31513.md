body: "I'm looking for the <a href=http://www.gotransit.com/publicroot/images/bottom_left_go2.gif>\r\n(very
  '60's) typeface used in this logo</a>. What I know about it is that it was availble
  in Lettraset in the late sixties and that it is extremely geometric. All the letters
  are basically made up of  squares and arcs subdivided vertically and/or horizonatlly
  in the middle. \r\n\r\nI remember seeing this typeface in an old Lettraset catalogue
  - which incidentally was exactly how the logo was created. GO Transit was started
  in 1967 by the government of Ontario (Government of Ontario Transit - get it? :)
  ) with a few used trains and a few stations. During the planning & start-up period
  the Ministry of Transportation's art department \"donated\" cabinets full of old
  lettraset - probably all the stuff they had no intention of ever using. A secretary
  was given the task of coming up with a logo and... voila. Not bad for a company
  that obviously placed so little value in design at the time. :o). \r\n\r\nany clues
  would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n(link should be fixed - & I
  added an attached image)\r\n\r\n(Edit, 02, 19. 07 - attached image - my attemt at
  reconstructing the font.)\r\nRuss\r\n"

    that covers 1/4th of the first circle \u2013 and then three lines cutting the
    pieces ;-)\r\n\r\nOr... three halfcircles, one 1/4th circle and a square."

      be surprized how many ways there are for sign companies to screw it up. :o)\r\n\r\nIt
      is a typeface. The original logo included the word \"TRANSIT\" in the same style. "

  body: "I added The word Transit to the attachments above. I had to redraw it. Essentially,
    it's an alphabet made from the minimum number of most geometrically basic possible
    shapes that will fit into a perfect square. It's easy to replicate, but I want
    to see how letters like Y, W, X, Z and numerals were handled within the rules
    the rest of the alphabet follow.\r\n\r\nStock is very close in some letters, but
    not quite a cigar... "
