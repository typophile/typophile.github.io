  and I played a bit with CSS3 and the @fontface rule. Maybe I am going to improve
  it. Been a long time, that I engaged with CSS. Tested in Firefox 3.6. And actually
  there is no navigation.

  body: "Because that\u2019s CSS3:\r\n\r\n<code>li:nth-child(29) {\r\n\tfont-size:
    36px;\r\n\t}</code>\r\n\r\nOtherwise I had to write li + li + li \u2026\r\n\r\nMy
    consideration was, that probably all webfont-capable browsers understand that
    CSS3 rule.\r\n\r\nI only know a bit Javascript. More to the point, I already have
    forgotten the most, that I did know about Javascript, and I never did know much
    about Javascript. It would be better to change the class of the waterfall-ul by
    clicking on the items of the style list at the top instad of repeating the code
    of the waterfall in the markup. And the font-sizes of each li-tag also should
    be changed with Javascript. That would be much more elegant and additionally it
    would reduce the file-size, which already is relatively small.\r\n\r\n<cite>Works
    fine in the latest Safari on Tiger</cite>\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not Delicious
    in your screenshot of Safari."

    :-D\r\n\r\nOut of my blog, I edited your Delicious test HTML, I saved, I tested
    and it worked perfectly, but it doesn't work in my blog because I put the six
    fonts groups on after the code \"body\" as you put them on after the code \"body\".\r\n\r\nI'll
    begin to study Html and CSS for discovering the secret. "
