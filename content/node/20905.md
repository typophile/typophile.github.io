body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Berlin last year I was impressed by the variety
  in type and style on the signage of Berlin's Rail Stations. Impressed, but also
  surprised as (and maybe it's a stereotype, but) I would have expected more uniformity.
  Particularly when you consider the story of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampelm\xE4nnchen\">Ampelm\xE4nnchen</a>.
  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was only there for a week, so a couple of days had passed
  before I really noticed, but I photographed what I could in the time that I had.
  This meant some shots were a bit blurry, but then I quite like blurry photos. \r\n\r\nSo
  I don't <cite>need</cite> to know if these samples have names, I'm just curious.
  Obviously a number of them pre-date digital typefaces, but they might still have
  a name or a history to them that one of you might know? I loved Berlin. Wish I could
  have stayed there longer, and not just so I could get more photos of train station
  signs. :-)\r\n\r\nFriedrichstrasse 1: So this one is good old Helvetica. (Which
  is <cite>all</cite> we have here in Melbourne.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01-friedrich_helv_4097.jpg]\r\n\r\nFriedrichstrasse
  2: I don't know this one.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02-friedrich_3573.jpg]\r\n\r\nStadtmitte
  1: This looks like DIN, but the 'S' is wrong.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03-stadtmitte_DINbutS_3625.jpg]\r\n\r\nStadtmitte
  2: This looks like Frutiger, but the 'i' is wrong.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04-stadtmitte_frutbuti_5456.jpg]\r\n\r\nStadtmitte
  3: I don't know this one.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05-stadtmitte_5070.jpg]\r\n\r\nUnter
  den Linden 1: This Helvetica Bold is a crime when you consider they've got the one
  below elsewhere at the station. :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06-unter_helvbold_5729.jpg]\r\n\r\nUnter
  den Linden 2: This is my absolute favourite.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/07-unterdenlinden_3669.jpg]\r\n\r\nPotsdamerplatz
  1: Don't know.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/08-potsdamerplatz_4938.jpg]\r\n\r\nPotsdamerplatz
  2: Don't know.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09-potsdamerplatz_6145.jpg]\r\n\r\nHallesches
  Tor: Don't know.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/10-halleschestor_4928.jpg]\r\n\r\nHansaplatz:
  This blurry one looks like Interstate Regular Condensed.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11-hansa_IntRegCnd_4693.jpg]\r\n\r\nNollendorfplatz:
  Don't know.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12-nollendorfplatz_3473.jpg]\r\n\r\nZoologischer
  Garten: And finally, I can't work out if this is Univers or Zurich.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13-zoologischer_univ-zuri_3889.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot."

    Reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/stratum2/index.html\">Stratrum</a>.\r\n\r\nStadtmitte
    2; Myriad.\r\n\r\nUnter den Linden 2 & Potsdamerplatz 1; Both \"jackboot grotesques\",
    Potsdamerplatz seems close to the 1934 Deutschland type.\r\n\r\nZoologischer Garten;
    Univers, just poorly executed."

  body: "<em>Friedrichstrasse 2</em>\r\nThis is a custom font, based loosely on Helvetica,
    which was made for the Deutsche Bahn a few years ago. This was done by [[Henning
    Krause]] (www.formgebung.com) for them. The Deutsche Bahn will not be using that
    in the future though. They have a new super family, which was recently designed
    for them by Erik Spiekermann and Christian Schwarz. I do not think that either
    the older face on that sign nor the new Bahn faces are/will be available for public
    distribution. But maybe the designers or the Bahn have something up their sleeve.\r\n\r\n<em>Stadtmitte
    2: This looks like Frutiger, but the \u2018i\u2019 is wrong.</em>\r\nThis should
    be [[FF Transit]] (specifically FF Transit Back, I guess, if it is a back-lit
    sign), which [[MetaDesign]] created in the early 1990s. After the reunification,
    Erik Spiekermann and his Meta Design firm (which he is no longer part of) created
    a comprehensive signage system and CI for the Berlin transit authority. Henning
    Krause may of been working at Meta then, and could have played a role in the design
    of this as well.\r\n\r\n<em>Unter den Linden 2 and Potsdamer Platz 1</em>\r\nThese
    are [[Schaftstiefelgrotesk]] lettering jobs\u2026 they seem very similar to [[Tannenberg]],
    which was a Neo-Gothic face popular in Germany in the 1930s, and seemingly in
    West German (to which West Berlin belonged) in the 1950s as well."

  body: "Stephen -\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing these. I was in Berlin last year too
    and was similarly struck by the lack of a coherent identity for the train signage
    (altho was WAY impressed by the punctuality of the trains! especially coming from
    NY where \"we're being held in the station by dispatch\" is the subway slogan)
    Can't shed much light on the fonts tho. I remember in particular that really odd
    font used for Stadmitte 3 - looks like someone made a font out of some bad handlettering.\r\n\r\nI
    loved Berlin too."

  body: "Geoff - I really like that Stratum. Just have to find a good job for it.
    \r\n\r\nDan - Thanks for those links. I wish I had more than a smattering of German.
    One day I'll find the time to learn it properly. (One day, one day). People always
    look at me blankly when I say I love German, but I think it's such a rich and
    expressive language. Like these Schaftstiefelgrotesk forms which are so expressive
    as well. Such a shame that Hitler had a preference for them. I guess they won't
    easily live that down.\r\n\r\nPatty - The Berlin system did run very well. Although
    I was in New York before I went to Berlin, and my subway experience there was
    great as well. Maybe I got lucky? I was amazed at the quality of the buskers in
    New York! There were full-on jazz combos down there and they were brilliant! It's
    obvious, but it was also amazing how many cultural references come to life in
    the New York subway: from Duke Ellington (I actually got to Take the 'A' Train,
    woo!) to the Beastie Boys (on the 1 or 9 line) for just two otherwise disparate
    examples. :-)"

    Type and National Identity by P. Bain and P. Shaw</a> (if you haven't already).
    It's a nice little book containing some great essays on blackletter. I was able
    to order my copy from Readings St Kilda which bought it in a heartbeat. :^)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Dan has some cool flickr photos of blackletter <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/sets/920641/\">here</a>

    before; it's a great looking face. I'm a sucker for a flared M. I think my favourite
    bit of type (just edging out the blackletter on the King's scroll), is that '<a
    href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/305529918/in/set-72157594386592999/\">diebels</a>'.
    So sharp and crisp, it's like a slap in the face. Absolutely magnificent bit of
    lettering. \r\n\r\nPatty, I loved Berlin and would love to go back sometime. Although,
    I've still got the rest of Germany to explore! \r\n"
