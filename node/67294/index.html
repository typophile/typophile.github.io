<p>As a Dutchman myself, I can say we type i + j, but see them as a single character. So they get capitalized together, and also stay together in vertical writing. (They also go into a single square in crossword puzzles ;) )</p>
<p>The only instance I can think of where i+j isn&rsquo;t seen as a single character is when they are the end and beginning of two seperate syllables, like in Bijoux (bi-joux), which is a word we borrowed from French.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bijoux&rsquo; is the sort of example I was interested in.</p>
<p>The reason I had asked is because I am working on a face where some of the alternate forms of ij differ from those which would be produced by the sequence i + j. Since I assumed most Dutch speakers would enter this character as a sequence, I was thinking of including a localised &lsquo;ccmp&rsquo; feature which substituted the sequence with the digraph, but the existence of words like &lsquo;bijoux&rsquo; demonstrates that that isn&rsquo;t a viable option.</p>

<p>In French, when using Word, the spelling dictionnary automatically substitutes (if automatic correction is activated) sœur for soeur, Œuvre for Oeuvre but leaves moelle and incoercible intact.  There is no need to type the letters Œ or œ.</p>
<p>For Dutch, the only words containing ij as two letters in  my Thunderbird dictionary are</p>
<p>Anastasija, Beijing, Dimitrij, Fiji, Henrijette, Maija, Marijanne, Mija, Mirijam, Mirijana, Nadija, Naija, Neija, Seija, Taija, Veijo, bijektion, bijektionen, bijektionerne, bijektiv, bijob, bijobbet, bijouteri, bijouterivarer, dijonsennep, fijianer, fijiansk, frijord, hijacker, hijacking, politijagt, rijsttafel</p>
<p>(is &ldquo;rijsttafel&rdquo; really with two separate letters?). That means (in my  opinion) the words with the letter ĳ should be automatically corrected by the spell checker. That is part of its job.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>There already is a topic which anwsers most of your questions: [[http://www.typophile.com/node/34111]]</cite></p>
<p>Ah, that was a fun thread. To repeat some of the relevant bits:</p>
<p>John Hudson: <cite>Actually, Unicode encoded the Dutch IJ/ij digraphs as distinct characters, separate from the I+J and i+j sequences, because they were pre-existing characters inherited from a Dutch telecom standard. For the most part, Unicode does not encode digraphs. But some are encoded for backwards, roundtrip compatibility, as in this case.</cite></p>
<p><cite>For the most part, Dutch users do not use the digraph characters &ndash; although some, like Thomas Milo, certainly advocate its use &ndash; they just type I+J and i+j. So far as I know, the IJ/ij digraph characters are not accessible via the standard Dutch keyboard.</cite></p>
<p>Me: <cite>I don&rsquo;t think automatic ligation is the best option because not every &lsquo;ij&rsquo; combination in Dutch is the digraph (even if for 99% of the time it is). The &lsquo;i&rsquo; and &lsquo;j&rsquo; might come from different syllables, or it might be a loanword.</cite></p>
<p><cite>My take: to use special &lsquo;ij&rsquo; and &lsquo;IJ&rsquo; ligatures for Dutch, one should manually search and replace the &lsquo;ij&rsquo; and &lsquo;IJ&rsquo; combinations in the text, taking care to make sure to replace only when the digraph is wanted.</cite></p>
<p>Does anyone know of a dictionary of the kind Michel was looking for, that distinguishes between the digraph &lsquo;ij&rsquo; and the non-digraph &lsquo;i&rsquo;+&lsquo;j&rsquo; sequence? I doubt one exists.</p>

<p>Not that I know of. It never has been a problem ;-)</p>
<p><cite>(Michel) That means (in my opinion) the words with the letter ĳ should be automatically corrected by the spell checker. That is part of its job.</cite></p>
<p>Jah. Well. Maybe not. Being Dutch, I&rsquo;d object against forcing all ij&rsquo;s to be typed as ĳs. (Not really visible, is it? I mean the separate &lsquo;i&rsquo; &lsquo;j&rsquo; to be typed as a single character.)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;ij&rdquo; has a <em>status aparte</em> in Dutch but it does not need any specialized software handling, where &ldquo;oe&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;œ&rdquo; <em>does</em>.
The status aparte is especially significant when capitalizing (IJmuiden, IJstijd) and sorting (as a single glyph in the place of &ldquo;Y&rdquo; &ndash; and suddenly, I have no idea what happens with native words starting with an &ldquo;Y&rdquo;! (before? after? interleaved?)).</p>
<p>Granted, sorting and capitalizing would be easier for programmers if the digraph was a single glyph, but virtually all of our current &ldquo;smart&rdquo; software would need to be re-written ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Martin Majoor writes in <em>&lsquo;Had de Franse koning schoenmaat 49?'</em> (his chapter in <em>&lsquo;Letters, een bloemlezing over typografie&rsquo;</em>):</p>
<p>&ldquo;De typisch Nederlandse diftong <em>ij</em> wordt in alfabetische lijsten op grond van haar klank vaak tussen de <em>y</em> geplaatst. Dat is net zo onjuist als dat met de letter <em>c</em> op grond van haar klank tussen de <em>k</em> of <em>s</em> rangschikt. En ook de andere diftongen (<em>au, eu</em> etc.) staan gewoon in alfabetische volgorde. Het gebruik om bij een beginhoofdletter de beide tekens van de <em>ij</em> in kapitaal te zetten - zoals in IJmuiden - is formeel gezien niet juist (men maakt er ook geen AUsterlitz van of OUde Pekela). De oorspronkelijke schrijfwijze Ymuiden ligt waarschijnlijk ten grondslag aan dit ingeburgerde gebruik. Bij spatiëren van een kapitaal woord met een lange IJ moeten dus ook de I en de J gespatieerd worden.
I J M U I D E N en niet IJ M U I D E N .&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ll try to translate it in English for those who don&rsquo;t speak Dutch.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;In alfabetical ordered lists, the typical Dutch diphtong <em>ij</em> is often ordered with the <em>y</em>, based on it&rsquo;s pronounciation. That is just as wrong as ordering the <em>c</em>, based on it&rsquo;s pronounciation, with the <em>k</em> or <em>s</em>. Also, other diphtongs (<em>au, eu</em> etc.) are ordered in a normal alfabetical way. The use of capitalizing both characters - as with <em>IJmuiden</em> - is formally wrong. The original spelling <em>Ymuiden</em> is probably the basis of the common practice. When spacing a word in capitals with an IJ, the I and J should be spaced seperatly.
<em>I J M U I D E N</em> en not <em>IJ M U I D E N</em> .&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, the other OpenOffice dictionaries I have seem to be sorted alphabetically, that  Dutch dictionary is not; it seems it was randomized. If it had been sorted, there would have been a way to test whether, according to those responsible for the dictionary, the digraph is the 25th letter of the alphabet or not. The way the dictionary is, there seems to be no way to test any hypothesis concerning the digraph and I start wondering if that is not intentional.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Concerning spacing, here is what the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/"><strong>Unicode Standard, Version 5.2</strong></a> says (chapter 7, pages 203-204):
<cite>
Another pair of characters, U+0133 latin small ligature ij and its uppercase version, was provided to support the digraph “ij” in Dutch, often termed a “ligature” in discussions of Dutch orthography. When adding intercharacter spacing for line justification, the “ij” is kept as a unit, and the space between the i and j does not increase. In titlecasing, both the i and the j are uppercased, as in the word “IJsselmeer.” Using a single code point might simplify software support for such features; however, because a vast amount of Dutch data is encoded without this digraph character, under most circumstances one will encounter an &lt;i, j&gt; sequence.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is a difference betvveen Form and Function.</p>
<p>The FORM of IJ, or better, Dutch &ldquo;Double I&rdquo; in analogij to &ldquo;Double U&rdquo; (vvhich nobodij vvould seriouslij consider to be a digraph or a ligature), can appear as a digraph looking like a juxtaposition of I+J. But that is just one of its possible forms, another one is ü vvith the tail of j, or a Ü vvith an interrupted left leg. All of this can be encoded vvhichever vvaij ijou vvant - as a single character or a ligature. The realitij is that Dutch users are forced to tijpe vvith the tvvo strokes I+J - and Dutch-ignorant softvvare encodes it as I+J.</p>
<p>The FUNCTION of IJ (Double I) is completelij equivalent to the function of Double U: it&rsquo;s a single character in Dutch orthographij. All the observations above like capitalization, horizontal spacing (where Martin Majoor is prescribing new usage and condemning actual practice), vertical spelling can lead to only one conclusion: IJ is a letter and lacks proper support. Apps like the iPhone vvould do vvell to capitalize IJ correctlij vvhen the Dutch keijboard is active.</p>
<p>A convincing example is the Dutch version of the LINGO game, verij representative of the popular perception of a vvriting sijstem: IJ is treated bij the mass of Dutch speakers as a single letter - as a result it&rsquo;s a daily struggle to maintain it against English-biased software. The attached image also exposes naive layout software, wrestling to squeeze both Double I and Double U into the box.</p>
<p>The suggestion &ldquo;to search and replace the &lsquo;ij&rsquo; and &lsquo;IJ&rsquo; combinations in the text manuallij, taking care to make sure to replace onlij vvhen the digraph is vvanted&rdquo; comes form Outer Space. It is in fact denijing Dutch users the benefit of automation. In Dutch, everij I+J is Double I, the exceptions are negligible and, from a Dutch perspective, irrelevant. BTVV, the English vvord Fiji is spelled Fidji, so that&rsquo;s not even a candidate - I knovv, because I vvas UN liaison officer vvith the Fiji Battalion :-).</p>
<p>To give the foreign readers an impression of what Dutch really looks like without proper support for IJ, I have changed in this English text all digraphs W into VV and, in passing, all letter Y into IJ. To correct this, you are advised to manually replace all affected letter groups with the correct English digraphs.</p>

<p>Your Brill examples are hardly contemporary! The regular &ldquo;J&rdquo; also hangs below the baseline, so the &ldquo;IJ&rdquo; is just conforming to the entire character design.</p>
<p>Otherwise, well, what I said, great. The Lingo tv shot is hilarious! Never noticed that before. It seems the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; characters are horizontally centered but &ldquo;IJ&rdquo; is not. The Bosatlas (maps) samples show &ldquo;IJ&rdquo; does <em>not</em> get broken when spacing out text:</p>
<p>F R A N K R IJ K</p>
<p>Its index shows &ldquo;IJ-&rdquo; between &ldquo;Ii-&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ik-&rdquo; &hellip; which, actually, <em>looks</em> totally logical to me (a born and bred Dutchie), and I&rsquo;m starting to think sorting&rsquo;s not a problem either way because we just <em>may</em> unwittingly have developed a habit of looking in <em>two</em> places for &ldquo;IJgenwijs&rdquo; :-O</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know that the Dutch &ldquo;ij&rdquo; glyph has a separate character in OCR-B, and that at least some manual typewriters sold in the Netherlands did have a key for &ldquo;ij&rdquo; even if the Dutch keyboard for Microsoft Windows does not. So it is indeed more than just a ligature, even though the fact that it is treated as a letter of the alphabet by the Dutch is confusing to everyone else.</p>
<p>Of course, the thought that &ldquo;ij&rdquo; is really the Dutch way of writing &ldquo;y&rdquo; would mean that there <em>is</em> a key for it on every Latin keyboard&hellip; and all one has to do is draw the glyph appropriately. That, though, is probably not a realistic option - and, indeed, one of the examples given shows IJ as collating as though it were i + j instead of as Y, even if another example shows it drawn almost as a y-umlaut.</p>
<p>I had remembered about IJ in OCR-B from the article &ldquo;Inside ASCII&rdquo; by Bob Bemer in Interface Age: I was able to find two examples on the web:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fontage.com/pages/ocrb10n.html">http://www.fontage.com/pages/ocrb10n.html</a>
<a href="http://www.barcode-soft.com/kb/ocrb.aspx">http://www.barcode-soft.com/kb/ocrb.aspx</a></p>
<p>showing this - the face is monospaced, so the IJ characters omit the serif which is present on I and J as individual letters.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas, I never questioned the proper typographic practices regarding ij in Dutch. While I appreciate the numerous examples, what they showed—IJ capitalized as a unit, treated as a unit when letterspacing, etc.—were certainly not new to me, and have all come up in the discussions here.</p>
<p>Surely, such appropriate typographic treatment would be much, much easier if the Dutch ij was encoded as a single character (well, you know what I mean), so I see where your argument is coming from. Also, electronic dictionaries with the ij encoded appropriately would be a great aid in automatized text processing.</p>
<p>However, my suggestion was based not on that ideal situation but on the reality that the vast majority of digital texts in Dutch including electronic dictionaries do not encode the ij as a single character but use the sequence i+j. The standard Dutch keyboard has no way of inputting the Dutch ij other than as the sequence. Even if the Dutch adopt a new keyboard enabling them to enter ij, there will be a huge amount of legacy texts to deal with, plus the fact that outsiders will presumably continue to type i+j for any ij in Dutch.</p>
<p>So I am operating under these assumptions when I oppose automatic ligation for ij, even if in Dutch texts 99% of the i+j combination represents the character ij (as you can check, I already acknowledged this). That and the fact that language tagging of existing digital texts is not entirely reliable. Do we trust that texts in Dutch will be consistently tagged as being Dutch, and that portions of non-Dutch text in a predominantly Dutch document will also be appropriately language-tagged? This just isn&rsquo;t realistic.</p>
<p>I said &ldquo;one should manually search and replace the &lsquo;ij&rsquo; and &lsquo;IJ&rsquo; combinations in the text, taking care to make sure to replace only when the digraph is wanted.&rdquo; Maybe I made it sound cumbersome, but is it really too much to ask that a human editor check to see if the text is (a) in Dutch and (b) doesn&rsquo;t contain one of the very, very rare instances in Dutch where the combination i+j shouldn&rsquo;t be replaced by the ij character? It&rsquo;s still search and replace, which the software automatically does for you. I&rsquo;m merely warning against blind automatism, where you think you can simply build this functionality into a font, for instance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Using the proper codes for UC&amp;lc &ldquo;Double I&rdquo; would be best, and I agree that without an input method, this will not happen.</p>
<p>A hardware keyboard is a no-brainer. Easiest would be a Dutch keyboard driver or locale that intercepts all I+J sequences and and replaces them. Without manual or automatic correction it would of course also affect a minimal number of borrowings. But it would be ridiculous to consider minimal damage to a limited number foreign words a problem, while real damage to Dutch words was never a concern. After all we now have have a legacy of tons of miscoded text - a fact that UNICODE standard has the chutzpah to use as an argument to perpetuate this bizarre situation :-)</p>
<p>Alternatively, smart font technology could be deployed to display I+J sequences as Double I. This makes sense, after all for the end-user it makes no difference how it&rsquo;s done, as long as it works. But that doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem of sorting. &ldquo;Double I&rdquo; really belongs at the end of the alphabet, because words so spelled often correspond with words that have Y. This is especially the case with names. Some branches of the same family spell their names as Meijdrecht, others as Meydrecht. When correctly sorted, these names would be mixed into the same positions, but when sorted with I+J they are split up. Very unpractical and counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>In either case, but especially when using font technology instead of proper coding, some kind of language tagging is helpful, but not mandatory. Not to have language tagging is harmless when compared with the present automatism, that blindly - and wrongly - assumes that for Dutch, like for English, any combination of I+J is not a Double I. For Dutch it&rsquo;s really more pragmatic to assume that all cases of I+J are Double I, and accept some marginal collateral damage. At least then you get the casing and sorting, and about everything else, right.</p>

There are many Frisian place names ending in -um (&ldquo;heem&rdquo;, &ldquo;Heim&rdquo;, &ldquo;home&rdquo;?) in a broad Frisan belt that starts just North of Amsterdam (West Friesland), and that follows the coastline (Friesland, East Friesland) - all the way to the Danish border.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What problem would it cause to temporarily encode ĳ as ÿ and Ĳ as Ÿ. The letters Y and y with dieresis do not occur in Dutch, so far as I know, and should be as easy to type as ë for instance. The names Meÿdrecht and Meydrecht would be properly sorted. After sorting, globally substituting ĳ for ÿ and Ĳ  for Ÿ would produce a file ready for final processing. In fact, it should also be quite easy to modify a keyboard layout so that the combination normally giving ÿ would produce ĳ and the one normally giving Ÿ would produce Ĳ. Again, global substitution between ÿ and ĳ can be applied for sorting and backwards for producing the final text.</div>

<p>Are there many such names? What I have in mind is certainly not ideal but assuming ÿ is substituted for ĳ for sorting and then ĳ is substituted for ÿ, we then end up with Croĳ, which is wrong. It is then possible to replace globally Croÿ for Croĳ and if the list of such names is small, that may still be worth considering for batch processing (unless there are two names that are identical, except that one uses the ĳ digraph and the other ÿ).</p>

<p>For sorting without having to write a sorting procedure and without having to figure out how to use <code>localedef</code> to define a new locale with a collating sequence where the digraph ĳ would be sorted as y or ÿ (which I don&rsquo;t know how to do on my Mac; I guess I could do it on Linux).</p>
