  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dalton Maag was founded in 1991 by [[Bruno Maag]] and [[Liz Dalton]] after they returned from Chicago, USA, where Bruno worked for [[Monotype Corporation]]. Initially working on smaller projects, such as refining logotypes, we have been entrusted with providing typographic solutions for large, multi-national corporations.</p>
<p>Today, we boast a skilled staff and a high-quality client list, both corporate clients and design agencies, many of whom have returned to employ our skills and expertise again and again; many of whom have become our friends.</p>

During this time he re-cut all of the typefaces then in use by The New Yorker magazine for use on Macintosh. After returning to England in 1991 Bruno started Dalton Maag with Liz Dalton. Bruno is also the current Chairman of [[The Typographic Circle]].</p>
