body: "Hello all, I'm a 3rd-year graphic design student from Wisconsin (UW-Stout),
  currently studying abroad at the Wanganui School of Design in Wanganui in New Zealand.
  Currently I'm creating a typeface for an installation that I'm also in the process
  of creating. The idea is that I stencil type onto fabric using water-resistant silicone
  spray (I originally used wax[hence the name], but that didn't work as well), and
  then let food coloring and water drip from a holding tank on to the fabric.  As
  water soaks the fabric, the text is slowly revealed by the resistance of the silicone
  spray as the water (and dye) go around it. I guess it's sort of like a batik process.\r\n\r\nThe
  concept is to create a face that can withstand extreme distortion due to the highly
  variable context in which it will be used.  They were originally drawn up at the
  size I intend to stencil them. I've separated out any intersection where the wax
  or spray would spread out too much.\r\n\r\nThe letterforms themselves aren't based
  on any particular face, though in retrospect that was what I should have done. As
  it is, they're based on mostly on my experience creating minscule-scale bitmap fonts
  back when I did pixel art in high school and middle school.\r\n\r\nIt loses most
  of its character when applied to fabric, but it remains fairly legible and overall
  I'm pleased with what I have. To give it some more appeal outside of its (very specific)
  intended use, I've done what I can to add interesting flourishes. The inconsistent
  baselines are an attempt to reconcile the fact that the \"serifs\" (which are actually
  intended to build up areas of water-resistant material to aid legibility once it
  goes onto the fabric\u2014a sort of \"fail-safe\" measure in case water encroaches
  on a stem or crossbar somewhere and blots out part of a character) stick out beyond
  any other line that rests on the baseline or cap line.\r\n\r\nA sample of the typeface
  as I have it currently is attached. I'm open to any critique, but I'm most interested
  in proportion, stroke weight, and overall visual consistency (I think I might have
  a problem with the G, for instance). Thanks!"

  body: Does your school have a textile or printmaking facility you can use? Your
    problem is mainly in your process. If you want to keep the details, I would suggest
    a different approach, maybe screenprinting. If you want it to have a washed-out,
    hombre-like feel to it, then I would recommend beefing up your typeface, increasing
    the space between shapes and accentuating the details.

  body: "I'm placing priority on the idea that the text should be only revealed as
    the dye seeps down: silicone spray is almost completely invisible on the fabric.
    Screen printing would be easier and look nice (and also be more controllable),
    but it would run counter with what I'm trying to do with this installation.  Thanks
    for the comment, though. How would I accentuate the details\u2014increase the
    distance between the serifs? Make them larger?"

  body: Make the serifs larger, beef up the space between shapes, increase the weight
    of the whole typeface. You might want to search on typophile for "ink trap," the
    concept of ink traps is more or less the solution to making your typeface work
    on fabric.
