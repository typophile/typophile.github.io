body: Won't a www ligature be terribly useful? Or do ligatures have to be Siamese
  twins, not triplets?

    sort of way, as long it looks like more than two \"w\"s. BTW, ligatures can be
    formed of a <strong>lot</strong> more than two characters! Just ask Granjon about
    his Greeks.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: well, one option is to dump the 'www' prefix when it's not needed. But I do
    think a www ligature would be nice to see.

  body: 'I think the www ligword works for Salmiak because it is such an illustrative
    typeface and the ligword itself moves beyond a combination of letters and becomes
    a sort of illustration. I''d wonder if the www just becomes a pattern and agree
    that it really isn''t needed any longer. '

  body: I only wish that www wasn't needed anymore. At least around here, I still
    see a lot of domains that show different pages (usually 404s) when  accessed without
    www.

  body: "We only managed to shed http:// not so long ago.\r\n\r\nYou'll be surprised
    when designing to reach the masses (eg for internet banking, govt sites, etc),
    you have to be very explicit. \r\n\r\nI don't know how old everyone else is, but
    I always use my parents as a gauge. They're not internet saavy at all. If my target
    audience include people like them, I feel I have to include www, just to make
    it that much more obvious that it's a website, not anything else.\r\n\r\nThere
    are all kinds of confused people out there. Once I saw an email address like this
    email@www.domain.com.\r\n\r\nAnd another time, in a test, where we ask people
    to guess where clicking on each button will bring them. This nice lady said, \"If
    I click here, I will get articles on home and cooking, etc...\" It was the HOME
    button!"

  body: "<em>Everybody knows. Most browsers don\u2019t even need it. Maybe all.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's
    a server issue. www.domain.com and domain.com can point at two completely different
    web sites. Most competant web admins will make sure they point at the same, but
    as was mentioned, you still run into poorly set up sites that force you to use
    the www\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have a fascination with thresholds. You know those mini ketchup and mustard
    bottles, the ones that are short & stout, with [relatively] very wide openings?
    Well, is such a container a bottle, or a jar? How short/shallow does the neck
    have to be before a bottle is actually a jar? And who decides, how? And if this
    sort of thing can be determined empirically, over how long a period would such
    a determination stay valid (within the confines of the margin of error of the
    experiment), considering that mindsets and terminology change over the generations,
    or even within one person over his lifetime? And all this applies to glyphs too:
    Can we design a glyph that people simply won't be able to decide if it's a \"u\"
    or a \"v\"? Some people will quickly be sure; others will refuse to make a determination.
    I think most people would deliberate about it, then eventually decide (if only
    because they're asked to). Now, there must be a 50-50 threshold, but would the
    bell curve be spiky enough to justify the time spent finding it? And most of all:
    how can such ambivalent glyphs be useful, I mean in the practical realm of communication?
    Can they say two things at once, or maybe say nothing, and as a result convey
    something fundamental about the human condition? Gorgias was right, really - to
    hell with my SMC philo teacher, historical-revisioning that he killed himself
    in a confused stupor (while in fact he retired to horticulture, like Sumner Stone),
    doubtless to give his own narrow existence less insignificance.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
