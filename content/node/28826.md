  body: sprout is probably customized. I see elements of various fonts there incl
    Chalet.

  body: I'd like to point out that the 's' in "sprout" is unmistakably [[Frutiger]]'s
    <a herf="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.120809.0.7&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=sprout&sampleSize=48">Avenir</a>.
    The other characters -- except from the 'p' -- look identical to Avenir's as well
    (the left part of the cross bar on the 't' has been cut off of course).
