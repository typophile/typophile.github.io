body: "I\u2019ve been working on a family of multiscript monospaced bitmap screen
  fonts, and I\u2019d appreciate your comments. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttyp0-hmb-20120421_4287.gif]\r\n\r\n<strong>Some
  remarks in advance:</strong>\r\n\r\nAs a monospaced bitmap font family, ttyp0 is
  obviously a bit of a dinosaur. I started to work on the ASCII part of the 8x16 size
  something like twenty years ago, because I was dissatisfied with the ugly fonts
  offered by X Windows; later more sizes, styles and characters were added (with very
  long breaks in between). The fonts are primarily intended for those old-fashioned
  computer users who still do most of their work using old-fashioned terminal emulator
  programs (like me): for programmers, system administrators, and Unix power users.
  It\u2019s a workhorse \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to \u201Clook perfectly normal\u201D,
  or at least, as normal as possible given the constraints of multiscript monospaced
  bitmap fonts. It\u2019s not supposed to be fancy, or cool, or to attract any attention
  to itself.\r\n\r\nttyp0 comes in five sizes (6x12, 7x14, 8x16, 9x18, 11x22). All
  of them have a regular and a bold version; for 8x16 and 9x18, there is also an italic.
  (Italic doesn\u2019t really fit for the other sizes.) The italic fonts do contain
  italic parentheses, brackets, and braces, since these are also used in text, but
  mathematical operators, dingbats, line graphics, etc. are copied from the corresponding
  upright fonts. (Mathematical typesetting uses italic exclusively for Latin and Greek
  letters). For Hebrew, italics are replaced by semi-bold.\r\n\r\nThe regular styles
  (up to 9x18) are sans-serifs with constant stroke width, with the obvious exception
  of some very narrow letters, such as I, J, i, j, where serifs are unavoidable in
  a monowidth font.\r\n\r\nThe bold styles and the 11x22 regular have varying stroke
  width, and they are hybrid serifs (there are serifs on the horizontal strokes, but
  usually none on the vertical strokes). This is unorthodox, but a consequence of
  the low resolution bitmap: A constant stroke width of 2px would be much too dark
  for an 8x16 or 9x18 font, so alternating between 1px strokes and 2px strokes is
  the only choice. But then the contrast between thin and thick strokes is so large
  that serifs on the thin (horizontal) lines become necessary for compensation. On
  the other hand, for most letters, there is not enough horizontal space to put decently
  looking serifs on the verticals. The form of the serifs (slab or wedge) is uniform
  within one size/style, but varies between different font sizes in order to create
  the right text color. For Hebrew, both horizontal and vertical lines are boldened
  \u2014 if only the horizontal lines were boldened, they would appear too light compared
  to the other scripts.\r\n\r\nttyp0 uses a relatively large x-height. For Latin and
  Cyrillic, this should improve legibility; I hope that it\u2019s still acceptable
  for Greek. For Armenian and Georgian, the x-height is reduced a bit; it is still
  larger than it should be in a monoscript font, but in a multiscript font, reducing
  it even more would be problematic. \r\n\r\nThe Thai font is somewhat experimental
  \u2014 a 6x12 matrix is not really sufficient for Thai, and even the 9x18 and 11x22
  versions would benefit from some additional vertical space. Moreover, ttyp0 is a
  BDF font and the BDF format does not provide means for proper positioning of floating
  accents, so Thai vowel signs and tone marks are implemented by naive overprinting.
  The results are obviously not optimal. \r\n\r\n<strong>Dubious design decisions:</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Stroke
  contrast:</em>\r\nThere are some spots in the bold fonts where I deviated from the
  conventional distribution of thick and thin strokes. Examples include the right
  leg of capital U, where a 1px stroke would have been too thin for my taste, and
  the crossbar of capital \xD0, where a 1px stroke would not have been sufficiently
  visible. I\u2019ve also used thick strokes for the extenders of some lowercase Armenian
  letters, such as \u0563, \u0564, and \u057C, in order to compensate for the fact
  that there was not enough space to make these strokes sufficiently long. It should
  make these letters more easily recognizable, but I\u2019m not sure whether native
  speakers find this helpful or irritating.\r\n\r\n<em>Commas vs. quotes:</em>\r\nFor
  low-resolution bitmaps, I prefer a slanted comma to a curled one, in particular
  since the curled ones tend to be either too large or too close to periods. Unfortunately,
  slanted quotes don\u2019t work well in a multilingual font: With curly quotes, one
  uses high-66 high99 for English and low-99 high-66 for German, whereas using slanted
  quotes, one uses high-\\\\ high-// for English and low-// high-// for German. As
  high-66 (Unicode 201C) corresponds to high-\\\\ in English and to high-// in German,
  no slanted glyph will be satisfactory under all circumstances. As a result, I am
  now stuck with commas that are stylistically very different from quotes. That\u2019s
  not nice, but the other choices aren\u2019t nice either.\r\n\r\n<em>Poor man\u2019s
  kerning:</em>\r\nIn some font sizes and styles, letters with high arms and without
  low arms (e.g., F, \u0393) are moved to the right (compared to, say, capital E).
  This is intentional.\r\n\r\n<em>Glyph collisions:</em>\r\nThere are some cases where
  a glyph collides with the following one. Most of these cases seem to be harmless,
  either because only one or two pixels of a glyph touch the neighbouring one (\u201CTh\u201D
  in 6x12 bold and 8x16 bold), or because the letter combination is rare (\u201C\u0448\u0448\u201D
  in 7x14 regular). There is one exception, namely the sequence \u201Cmm\u201D in
  7x14 regular: the letter combination is frequent in some languages and the glyphs
  touch each other along the full length of the stem. Still I prefer this to a compressed
  or asymmetric \u201Cm\u201D. (Unfortunately, in Armenian, the frequency of wide
  letters (\u0561, \u056D, \u057A, \u057F,\u0583) is so large that using compressed
  glyphs is unavoidable.)\r\n\r\n<em>Turned letters:</em>\r\nSome of the turned letters,
  such as \u201C\u0250\u201D or \u201C\u0259\u201D, differ from the non-turned versions.
  If the \u201Ce\u201D of, say, 8x16 is turned, it would look very similar to an \u201Ca\u201D
  (and vice versa), so some disambiguation is necessary.\r\n\r\n<em>Diacritic marks:</em>\r\nIn
  certain font sizes and styles, the bitmap font designer has the choice between making
  the caron unnaturally small, making the breve unnaturally large, or displaying both
  in the same way. As there is usually little risk of confusion between the two (orthographies
  using both over the same letter are virtually non-existent), ttyp0 uses sometimes
  the same glyph for breve and caron. The same applies to cedilla and undercomma.\r\n\r\n<em>Underline:</em>\r\nNowadays
  the underline character is no longer used for underlining, but for compound identifiers
  in programming languages and web addresses. For these applications, an underline
  character on the base line work better than an underline character below the base
  line.\r\n\r\n<em>ASCII non-alphanumerics:</em>\r\nFor the non-alphanumeric ASCII
  characters, ttyp0 uses mostly the \u201Ctraditional Unix glyphs\u201D: Tilde is
  raised, asterisk is centered, less and greater signs have a relatively large angle
  (which works better when these characters are used as a replacement for angular
  brackets, such as in HTML.) The ASCII apostrophe is asymmetric (and the ASCII grave
  is its mirror image): People who still use these characters (rather than \u201Ctypographic
  quotes\u201D), use them for many different purposes, and while a slanted glyph looks
  bad in some of these contexts, an anorexic upright glyph looks bad all the time.
  (Alternative glyphs are available as an installation time option.)\r\n"

    \ Actually I'm not sure it's too late for something like this, since many electronic
    devices (think of appliances, like coffee makers) still use lo-res 1-bit displays.
    However the constraint of monospace (which, predictably does the most \"damage\")
    although I understand your original intent, might actually be worth abandoning.
    How much programming is done in non-Latin, or even non-English? Unless it's important
    to have non-Latin text strings in programming not cause misalignment.\r\n\r\nPretty
    much all your design compromises seem superbly pragmatic. And making the Armenian
    (and Georgian) x-height smaller is very refreshing, especially in this niche application.
    And I love seeing that classical \xAB\u0570\xBB in a bitmap font! :-)  Just some
    of your bold forms (in many of the scripts) might need tweaking.\r\n\r\nBravo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
