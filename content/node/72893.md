  suggestions for me . . .\r\n\r\nI'm trying to locate and purchase a Typositor or
  Typositor reel assembly for sale?\r\n\r\nI don't require a working Typositor per
  se but rather the reel to reel assembly to be able to review 2\" fimstrip fonts
  . . .\r\n\r\nKindly advise or suggest where I may obtain these . . .\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your thoughts and suggestions gang!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart"

  body: "Thanks for the inspiration Nick!\r\n\r\nMy brain wasn't able to muster the
    related nature of old film winders . . .\r\n\r\nYour links were exactly what I
    needed to get going . . . Thanks for that!\r\n\r\nFYI, while I can likely create
    my own cobbled together contraption from this, it seems impossible to find a 2\"
    specific format since the closest equivalent size is 51mm but this isn't an actual
    filmstrip size so I'll have to hack down a 75mm reel or hack up a 35mm one . .
    .\r\n\r\nFunny how the technology goes . . .\r\n\r\nAgain many thanks and if anybody
    spots an old typositor sitting on a curb, please post here!\r\n\r\nStuart"

    possible that a local TV station has some junk in its basement they wouldn't mind
    getting rid of..."
