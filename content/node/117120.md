  body: There are plenty of fonts that look similar to that. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/zapfino/linotypezapfino-three/|Linotype
    Zapfino Three]], for instance., which isn't quite the same. There is a possibility
    that the sample you have provided isn't a font at all and was painted on by hand.

    body: Thanks! I'm pretty sure it wasn't painted on, because this was an ameture
      graphic. That font is awesome, thanks!
