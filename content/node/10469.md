  <BR>Posted on Wednesday, April 13  <BR> <BR> <BR>Microworld claims that its new
  plugin for the Windows version of Photoshop can create clearer type output at small
  point sizes.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no doubt that generating clear type output at
  small point sizes from any image editing application can be a challenge. Microworld
  has come up with a new approach in the form of a Photoshop plugin that it believes
  provides &#34;ultra-clear&#34; font output. It also adds a few extra touches, such
  as the ability to employ a user-defined font directory and provides a character
  map to ease font and symbol selection, with support for multiple languages.  <BR>
  <BR>Sharptype is available as shareware on the Microworld site, with registration
  costing $29.95. The unregistered version provides a limited range of font sizes.  <BR>
