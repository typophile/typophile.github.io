  body: "I think the answer is \"no\". Generally folks here don't post unless they
    have something constructive to add, i.e. a positive ID, or clues as to what it
    might be.\r\n\r\nThere's no need to bump your post, especially as it's only a
    day old. Members often go back through the last couple of days' posts to see if
    they can solve any lingering mysteries. I know you want to know what your type
    is, but so does every other poster. Members do this out of a love of type, for
    fun. We're not getting paid. Most have jobs, other commitments.\r\n\r\nIf you
    haven't had a reply, you're not being ignored; folks have likely drawn a blank
    and moved on.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
