body: My client used it in a newsletter & I have to replicate it for one of their
  websites.  They told me it's "stencil".  It's not, and I don't know what it is.  Does
  anyone know what weird version of Stencil this might be, or if this is a completely
  different animal?  Thanks!  Jennifer[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font1_5643.jpg]
