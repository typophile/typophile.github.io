body: "So I was looking at my TV screen the other day and what my Playstation was
  showing there and noticed how really nice [[http://typophile.com/files/ps3-menu-font_4772.jpg|its
  menu font]] was. After a bit of tracking and [[http://typophile.com/node/64596|with
  help of akira1975]] the font happened to be [[http://www.fontworks.co.jp/typography/family/rodin|Rodin]]
  by the Japanese foundry, Fontworks.\r\n\r\nIt is really pricey, over $200 for a
  single weight. Plus shipping and handling as the CD is the only delivery method.
  Plus it quite understandably includes hieroglyphics, which I do not see using in
  any foreseeable future. \r\n\r\nAll this doesn't make its Roman letters any less
  nicer. So I had this rather dumb thought to try and create my version of Rodin.
  \r\n\r\nI fully realize how utterly unqualified I am for the task, and how monumental
  the task itself is, but (a) I am really curious to give it a try (b) one can't learn
  without trying (c) I am in no rush and have no other incentive except for the curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe
  question I have though is this. How \"OK\" is it to try and replicate an existing
  type ? Not pixel by pixel or curve by curve, of course, but more of having an ultimate
  goal of creating a similarly looking type. \r\n\r\nI am asking because on one hand
  there is Swiss 721/Pragmatica/etc siblings of Helvetica, and Rodin itself seems
  to be borrowing extensively from Akzidenz-Grotesk, but on the other hand there is
  [[http://typophile.com/node/56010|Great MyFonts Purge]] thread.\r\n\r\nMy apologies
  for the \"noob\" question, but I would really appreciate any insight where does
  the line go between copied/cloned and inspired/derived types.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPS.
  Typophile.com guys, are you reading the feedback emails ? I tried using it to ask
  about changing the account name several days ago, but never heard anything back."

    Helvetica had at least two other siblings. One was Swiss 721, but the names of
    others I forgot. Wikipedia had Pragmatica listed along with CG Triumvirate and
    Nimbus Sans, and I blindly copied the name from there. No offense implied."

  body: "Aesthetically, it seems like this question of cloning/inspiring is purely
    a function of similarity. For each face, somewhere between 0.1% and 99.9% similarity
    is a threshold where people will stop ascribing \"inspiration\" and start bemoaning
    \"cloning\".\r\n\r\nOf course, if you simply want your own personal version of
    it for your own use, does it really matter what others think?"

  body: "> So, I was correct: neither is the original Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI did not
    speak of \"the original Helvetica\". I spoke of \"the original\" as opposed to
    \"a clone\". For instance, if someone places a banknote on a color copier and
    make a color copy of the banknote, then, in my terminology, the banknote is \"the
    original\" and the result of the copying process is \"the copy\".\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    in my terminology, \"Nimbus Sans\" is a copy (= clone) of \"Helvetica\", and \"Nimbus
    Sans Novus\" is a copy (= clone) of \"Neue Helvetica\".\r\n\r\nIn my terminology,
    \"the original Helvetica\" would be the very first design made by Max Miedinger
    in ca. 1957, just like \"the original work\" is the first edition or editio princeps
    of a literary or other work."

    of a ... (original as noun/substantive)\r\n\r\nEnglish is not my mother-tongue,
    but to judge from English dictionary definitions, \"original\" as noun and as
    adjective are semantically different in English. For instance, Webster's Collegiate,
    eleventh editition, defines:\r\n\r\noriginal, adjective = \"being the first instance
    from which a copy is made\"\r\n\r\noriginal, noun = \"that from which a copy is
    made\" (there is no mention of first instance in this definition)\r\n\r\nSo, the
    noun does not necessarily denote the first instance. Therefore, if someone makes
    a copy from \"Neue Helvetica\", \"Neue Helvetica\" would be \"the original\" (noun),
    although \"Neue Helvetica\" is not the first instance of Helvetica and hence not
    \"the original (adjective) Helvetica\".\r\n"
