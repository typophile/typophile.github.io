		<div class="commentbody">Since most people still choose a serif for text composition, the closest thing to a &ldquo;Helvetica of text faces&rdquo; is Times Roman. Times is a good, useful face that, like Helvetica, is now so ubiquitous in our visual environment it&rsquo;s practically invisible, and that&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t make it your house text font.
How about [[http://www.linotype.com/112295/itcstone-clan.html?gclid=CKiM462_25gCFQG7GgodwX8tcw|ITC Stone]]? The serif is dignified but not boring, and is available with small caps, old style figures, etc. There&rsquo;s a handsome italic, and it comes in Semibold and Bold weights. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stoneserif_4382.JPG]
There&rsquo;s also a companion sans serif, which I like for text composition because it&rsquo;s not as rigidly geometric as many sans serifs. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stonesans_5704.JPG]
And if you want to get extra-friendly, there&rsquo;s Stone Informal, distinguished by blunted serifs, less contrast between thick and thin strokes, and a cursive-style lowercase <strong>a</strong> and <strong>g</strong>, even in the Roman.

<p>The contemporary &ldquo;Times&rdquo; is, as Celeste says, Minion. It is common enough for text settings that designers mutter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of Minion.&rdquo; There is a reason they&rsquo;re tired of it; it works so well for so many things.</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;ve been setting books for 30 years, and have never heard of Kievit or Milo. They may well be fine typefaces, but aren&rsquo;t desert island fonts yet.</p>

<p>That is because they didn&rsquo;t exist yet 30 years ago. ;)
That, and the fact you have never heard of them or used them, doesn&rsquo;t make them less good typefaces. Personally, I <em>have</em> used them both for long stretches of text, and they work beautifully.</p>
<p>In any case, they work better for text than Helvetica.</p>

<p>Think carefully about the forces you align yourself with professionally, and their inherent karma.
If you are looking forward to a comfortably numb career, Minion and Times will do just fine.
Once you get a few jobs in your portfolio set in such faces, your horizon will begin to shrink.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the responses guys! Okay so the best way to go forward from here:</p>
<p>I asked what Detail In Typography was set in because I thought it looked really great, but what do I know and Mr. Shinn says I&rsquo;ll get pigeon holed and I definitely do not want that to happen.</p>
<p>I have Adobe Minion Pro (probably came with CS3 or 4) so I can definitely afford that, ITC Stone looks pretty cool and I can buy the variations individually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to have to wait on FF Kievit or FF Milo, seems like a good thing to bill a client for..</p>
<p>So the question is: what&rsquo;s the best way to get my hands on the licenses to better text faces? buy em' now out of (mostly empty) pocket? or wait till I get a job where the client will need a good text face and get it that way?</p>
<p>Mr. Shinn: are there any text faces that you could suggest to possibly broaden my horizon?</p>

It is nicely clean and open, but to me its ascenders are a bit too short for books, at least in the setting in that book.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A note on ITC Stone &amp; Sumner Stone&rsquo;s fonts generally:</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to get ITC Stone, get it from the Stone Foundry. Be a bit thoughtful though. The sans is just a touch larger than the serif &ndash; or maybe its the other way. The informal doesn&rsquo;t usually blend too well if you&rsquo;re using both the sans &amp; serif. My wife designed a book using all three which worked. It had three voices, a narrative track, an expert track, and an advice to families track. Using all three successfully was uncommon enough that Sumner included it in his exhibit at the SF library.</p>
<p>ITC Stone works best at slightly larger sizes, say 11-point, and as Bill says, can be a bit spikey. It was designed when we still ran repro, shot negatives, and burned plates, so the contrast in the letterforms is fairly great.</p>
<p>For general text use, I like Cycles much more, again from the Stone foundry. Sumner recently lowered his prices; there are some tremendous values there. I also like Magma and SFPL. Stone print is also useful when you have to pack text into a narrow measure.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not to get into a pissing match with Nick, but how much you interject yourself into a design &ndash; esp. with type choice &ndash; depends on the text you are setting. If  there is an author, their ideas and audience are paramount. If <em>you</em> want to challenge a reader, write your own book.</p>
<p>If it is unattributed text as in a brochure, there is likely more room for innovation in type choice.</p>

<p>Absolutely, add Sala and Scala Sans to the list. Perhaps Seria as well.</p>
<p>The kicker is that most lists will be partial because there are so many great serif faces out there. I think the goal is to build up a core set of &ldquo;workhorse&rdquo; faces and then build around those.</p>
