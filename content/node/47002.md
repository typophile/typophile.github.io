body: "Hi all,\r\nI am wondering, what are some good bitmap text fonts for searchable
  web content? I would like to improve the readablility of the content in the sites
  my company designs while at the same time keeping the content searchable. I know
  that Emigre was one of the first foundries to create bitmap fonts for screen use
  but are there newer designs/foundries that you could reccomend?\r\nI like the text
  font that is used in the Typophile forums. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n"

    be used at larger point sizes, say (9-11pt)? I am also concerned about readability
    issues with older users. Right now we are turning off the anti aliasing in Photoshop
    for the html content on our sites.\r\n\r\n"
