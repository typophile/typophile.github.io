  SDC School.\r\n\r\nOur foundation is known as the SDC Blue Ribbon Foundation and
  in this logo, we are trying to represent things like happiness, trust, and friendship\r\n\r\nWe
  are just looking for some critique on how we can improve our logo.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SDC_6595.jpg]"

  body: "It sounds like a wonderful organization, and a very worthwhile cause.  Have
    you considered hiring a professional designer?  Many will give discounts for causes
    that are worth supporting, and in the end the cause will benefit greatly by having
    a well designed logo - the first point of identity for your organization.  I would
    strongly suggest looking into the option at the very least.\r\n\r\nAbout your
    design:\r\nIt definitely reads as SDe.  Also, I think you have too many things
    going on here in too many different styles.  Simplify.\r\n\r\nOn another note,
    I often steer people away from acronym logos because acronyms create barriers
    between those who know what they stand for and those who can't figure out what
    those seemingly random strings of letters mean.  \r\n\r\nHope that helps!"

  body: "Yichen,\r\nThis literalist take on 'happiness, trust, and friendship' is
    too complicated. You've also introduced a major legibility problem. I think a
    much better starting place would consist of picking up a pencil and drawing letters
    that are happy, friendly, and/or trustworthy."

  body: Too many styles... And I agree with Luma. You may even get a pro-bono logo
    for your organisation. Try local design university programmes/schools...
