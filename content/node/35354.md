  will work on finding a graphical example to help out more, but here's the site if
  it helps:\r\nhttp://www.hbo.com/conchords/\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "that's one of them. thanks marcox. the one im most interested in is in the
    end credits of the show on hbo. I don't know a way to post an example. I'm gonna
    have to find a video that shows it and export a frame i guess and hope that works.\r\n\r\nhopefully
    there are some typophile FOTC fans out there who will know what i'm talking about."

  body: I just watched the show before posting my ID. The closing credit didn't really
    register -- I'll have to pay closer attention next time.

  body: I don't have an answer to the question (distressed Gotham seems right) but
    I can confirm the closing credits feature the same type as the above image --
    lowercase for position, CAPS for name.

  body: I think Marc has got it then. Definitely started as [[Gotham]]. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_bokka/">FF
    Bokka</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/holland_fonts/mundenge_rock/">Mundenge
    Rock</a>, and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/blockhead_alphabet/">Blockhead</a>
    are similar.

    I don't have a link.. got it off of one of those freefonts.com sites--but I don't
    know if it was that one or not!\r\n\r\nI'll keep an eye out. Been searching for
    an 'official' fotc font myself!"
