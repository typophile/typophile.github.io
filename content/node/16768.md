body: "hi everyone,\r\n\r\ni have to do a design for a concert ticket \"dummy\", that
  regular concert tickets which are used as master/model/template at the ticket sales.
  as it's for my own company i have the chance to do something special, like a retro
  styled template (like those old bus tickets from the 60s/70s). anyone has a suggestion
  or collected some concert tickets he can images of here? the dummy don't has to
  include any pre-positioned fields or so as the text printed on it varies. the task
  is to design some nice master/template tickets which can be over-printed using that
  regular black colored line/matrix-printer type. any suggestions? thanks: lars"

  body: Googling with advanced image search is even better you can select to only
    get large images so you have better pics to get ideas from you can even go to
    sites that sell tickets run searches for upcoming concerts like tina turner tickets
    or something similar find recent ones to see what the layouts are.

    & shows where they were likely to use well-designed tickets. Concerts given by
    well-known performers, Las Vegas shows, Broadway tickets, etc.
