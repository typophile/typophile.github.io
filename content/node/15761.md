  body: "I grew up very near Jacksonville. It's a very small and quaint community,
    the winner must be the new local celebrity - perhaps they should start a winery/vineyard
    as the area is experiencing an economic boom and the rich soil and lovely climate
    has produced award winning grapes over the last few years (as my parents have
    recently experienced for themselves.) Jaskonville has close ties with the neighboring
    town, culturally rich Ashland, well-known for it's passionate theatrical community
    and acclaimed Shakespeare festival.\r\nHmm, I suddenly feel like a spokesperson."
