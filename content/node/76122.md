    problems in justified text can often be improved by telling InDesign to use more
    hyphens, but the hyphenation controls are a little hard to find.\r\n\r\n1. Select
    the paragraph(s) you wish to adjust\r\n2. Open the Paragraph palette (Window >
    Type and Tables > Paragraph)\r\n3. In the upper right corner of the Paragraph
    palette is a tiny little arrowhead. Click and hold the arrow and select Hyphenation
    in the popup menu. \r\n\r\n(An alternate way to reach the hyphenation controls
    is to assign a style sheet to the text. The style sheet options include hyphenation
    controls.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, once you've reach the hyphenation controls, you'll have
    various options which are mostly self-explanatory. Try different settings and
    see how they affect the appearance of your selected text.  Be sure that \"Preview\"
    is selected so you can see immediately how the text is affected.\r\n\r\nHere's
    what the controls looks like (these are default settings). And remember that your
    changes will only affect the selected paragraphs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hyphenation_6256.jpg]"

    the paragraph and then change the first three numbers in the settings to 5 2 2
    (instead of 3 10 1) and see if that helps create more hyphens.\r\n\r\nAlso keep
    in mind that it's difficult to get attractive justification when there are only
    a few words per line. Try to get more words per line by widening the column, or
    by making the type smaller, or by switching to a condensed font.\r\n\r\nAnd fix
    \"place,titles\" (space missing); InDesign thinks its one long word.\r\n\r\nMaking
    these changes should help, but remember that InDesign justifies text by adding
    extra space between words. So you're unlikely to get perfectly consistent spacing
    between words. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> What do you do then to fix it?\r\n\r\nI would avoid using justified type
    in that situation. \r\n\r\nBut if you had no choice, adjust hyphenation settings
    to get the best results, hyphenating manually if necessary. You might find it
    helpful to temporarily change the justification to flush left rag right so you
    can clearly compare the actual lengths of each line and adjust the hyphenation
    until each line is as close to being the same length as possible. After doing
    that, change it back to justified.\r\n\r\nYou could also adjust the tracking of
    each line to reduce the gaps between words, and make adjustments to the Justification
    control panel, but if you've got huge gaps between words to begin with then I
    don't think those things will give you really attractive lines. \r\n\r\nIf this
    problem is occurring only in a few spots in your document, another approach is
    to rewrite those sentences so they break better."

    it any better) or it just jumps and overlaps the words. There has to be a way
    to do it, if you look at books and magazines their text is always justified and
    it forms such perfects squares and magazines especially do not change their grid
    just to fix the justification problem.\r\n\r\nAdjusting the hyphenation setting-
    changing it from the settings I posted in the picture would either lengthen the
    gaps or would do nothing. I understand adding hyphenations manually could help
    but it wouldn't necessarily help in this situation. I could try to post or email
    a copy of the indesign file and see what ways people could come up with to fix
    it. \r\n\r\nI ended up not using justified text in my design because I couldn't
    get it to work but my professor wants me to and said I just have to sit there
    and fix the gaps. I found this site and thought I would try to find a good book
    or some advice on how to fix it, since experimenting on my own I was unable to
    do get the desired results.\r\n"

    solution to your problem is proper Hyphenation & Justification, as others have
    tried to point out \u2014 not kerning. (The general public is getting into a disturbing
    habit of using the term \u201Ckerning\u201D to address a multitude of things which
    it is not. This is becoming a pet peeve of mine.)\r\n\r\nWith a narrow column,
    you will have to employ hyphenation to have any hope of getting good justification.
    The numbers in your screenshot are way off base. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of books
    discussing the principles behind good hyphenation & justification. Some have been
    mentioned. Find one and educate yourself about the purpose of each of the settings
    in both the Hyphenation and Justification dialogs.\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty
    of previous discussion on Typophile, with examples.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t recommend
    using the actual numbers in Bojev\u2019s example above. You\u2019ll need much
    tighter minimum word spacing for that particular setting."
