  rum, burbon, beer, and the lc -b- from the earlier kisbefe. Any suggestions on how

  body: Well, since no one has anything to say I guess I've managed to create perfect
    letters. Here is a <a href="http://www.grodworks.com/temp/errligs_draft1.pdf"
    target="_blank">sample</sample> of the ligatures. Because the ligatures depend
    on the basic character forms it would be nice if the basic character forms really
    were perfected before I make too many more (I'm planning on somewhere between
    20 and 500).

  body: "Forgive me Noah, as I've not read all of your other threads about this face.
    I'm a novice type designer and still have a lot to learn, but I can offer a little
    bit of a few things that I feel when looking at your face.\r\n\r\n1) I haven't
    quite figured out the logic of your rounded corners vs. your squared off corners.
    I don't see any consistency in that design aspect.\r\n\r\n2) Watch the weight
    of your strokes and stems, for example your K needs more weight on the strokes
    because your stem looks much heavier. On your R the bowl needs to be heavier and
    the weight of your junction strokes need to be consistent with your D and B.\r\n
    \r\n3) Your X doesn't quite make sense to me, it seems you're going for a sans
    serif with a high stroke contrast... I think you can play it up more with this
    character. The rounded corners also don't quite work for me.\r\n\r\n4) The Q has
    too many features. I would simplify it.\r\n\r\n5) Your \"c\" has the perception
    of being too narrow in comparison to your b, d, and e. Your e and c look like
    they're from different planets.\r\n\r\n6) V and A need a closer relationship.\r\n\r\n7)
    None of your hooks (J, j, g, y) have a consistent style.\r\n\r\n8) Crossbar of
    \"t\" is too heavy.\r\n\r\nI hope that's not too harsh. All in all, I like the
    ideas, but if this face is to be used at all for body copy you have to limit the
    number of features. People should read words, not identify individual letters.
    While your letters are nice to look at, there doesn't seem to be a complete harmony
    between them yet. I think what you have posted is a definite improvement over
    before, and I have seen your other type designs posted here as well and I think
    you have a promising future ahead. I hope this helps, good luck. "

  body: Absolutely amazing. About 5 or 6 years ago, when I started messing around
    with Font Design, I created a typeface almost exactly to what you have created
    here. I have since ditched the font for a later revival. Absolutely amazing. I'll
    post a picture of it when I get home from work, my very old website wasn't archived
    on the 'way back' machine.

    is called 'whipple.' <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/3715\" target=\"_blank\">This</a>
    is the first round I posted almost three years ago. Then I revised <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/whipple2-5173.swf\"
    target=\"_blank\">whipple</a> a little bit more.\r\n\r\nWhile the letter forms
    aren't exact, the similarities are pretty amazing. My letters are much more square,
    while your letters are slightly more rounded. There are glaring issues in my character
    design & kerning efforts, however I was working on that font almost two years
    ago and still haven't finished.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that you copied my font
    by any means, but it's darn close."

  body: "I'm sorry to disapoint, however; not only is this the first time I've ever
    seen your font but I also fail to see any similarities between \"whipple\" and
    kisbefe2 beyond the fact that they are both sans serif. Whipple has irregular
    strokes and a handwritten feel (the loop in the \"d\" or the exit stroke on the
    \"t\" are two examples).\r\n\r\nFrankly, were I not convinced that your \"I'm
    not saying that you copied my font by any means\" is not an attempt at apophasis
    so much as a poor choice of words, I would be offended by the implication of your
    statement and amazed that you would attempt to make such a tenuous connection.
    The evolution of kisbefe2 can be traced through this forum from its beginnings
    as a one hour doodle <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/nsans1a-65284.pdf\"
    target=\"_blank\">shown here</a> (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/9241\" target=\"_blank\">thread

    target=\"_blank\">KisbefeSans</a> and later just Kisbefe. The proportions, stress,
    and style are very different."

    of your "g". If that doesn't work, try other parts of your characters to match
    a consistent flow. You're getting really close...
