  body: 'Well, according to a PDF I downloaded from their site, there are several
    GEO-fonts used: Geo, Geo-Bold, Geo-BoldItalic, GeoHeadline. But I haven''t found
    a reference for it. As a substitute I''d recommend Neo Tech, Neo Sans, Digital
    Sans or the Hans Reichel-fonts like barmeno/Sari or even Dax.'

  body: "Land Registry's corporate font, Geo, was designed by Dalton Maag circa 2003/4
    and in association with North who were responsible for our overall identity programme.
    The family consists of four weights(regular, italic, bold, bold italic) at text
    size and a single headline weight of a distinct angular design. Panjapop has posted
    a copy of our all-staff guide on Flickr.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/panjapop/2634190823/in/set-72157605959784544/\r\n\r\nA
    better synopsis might still be found on the DM website."
