body: OK.  Having some trouble with coming up with a lockup for this logo.  I think
  the 3rd one on the right works the best in both contexts, but I am not happy with
  stacking the type to the right. <BR> <BR>I like putting it underneath logotype,
  but then it gets lost on the 1st sketch, and on the 2nd sketch I am not sure what
  to have extend beyond the right of the logotype.   <BR> <BR>Probably what will work
  best is a combination of 1 and 3.  Stack the type on the right when small, position
  it all underneath when big. <BR> <BR>But I want see what you all have to say. <BR>
  <BR>CAN is a network of creative professionals engaged in multimedia politically-focussed
  projects.  A lot of their work will be for broadcast, some for print and web. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks for your help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48608.gif"

  body: Sorry Peter, but until I read your last paragraph I thought that was a cut
    off E A and D sort of down the middle. It doesn&#39;t read to me. If you don&#39;t
    include the full name it makes no sense at all. Its just my opinion

  body: One last thought CAN is often used in the term &#34;In the can&#34; meaning
    inactive, not a good name for a pro-active group.

    the logotype.'

  body: 'Hello Peter <BR> <BR>I love the concept that the same shape can create three
    letters through rotation, but i have to agree with Daniel that without the subtitle,
    CAN is difficult to be read. On the other hand i think CAN is positive &#40;though
    i am not familiar with the common american language&#41; because the verb &#34;can&#34;
    neans anything but impossibility. <BR> <BR>But as you said Peter you asked for
    the type...  <BR>I think the best thing is -as you said- to be flexible with it,
    not just underneath or right, but also column underneath, depending on where and
    how big your logo is. <BR> <BR>Also aesthetically i would recommend to use a much
    bigger type in lc and extra light in the same row with CAN &#40;maybe even in
    the same x-height&#41; or a column underneath, so it will gently brake your constructivistic
    boldness. <BR> <BR>A last comment: if you can still touch the logo i think it
    would be intersting to put a small square or dot or anything upper and right of
    N so to help the legibility and also with a bright color there you could express
    energy and activity -like coming out of CAN. Hope that i helped. <BR> <BR>christos'

    do&#39; which is perfect for this type of org, IMHO. <BR> <BR>I can read the &#39;CAN&#39;
    OK. The full name certainly helps as well. <BR> <BR>I actually prefer the second
    one. <BR> <BR>HAve you tried stacking the type underneath letting the words take
    the full width? That would allow you to increas the size of the ACTION word which
    might be a nice emphasis'

  body: 'Christos, thanks for the feedback.  one thing I like about the letterforms
    being simliar is that it hits home this idea of network, similar elements coming
    together to make something.  also makes for interesting humanoidal patters. <BR>
    <BR>the idea of pairing a light sans is a good one.  I am liking some of those
    executions.  stacking isn&#39;t working though.  maybe I am not doing it correctly.
    <BR> <BR>I am liking the frame idea though.  could make for a strong branding
    element if i left-align and use it like a wrapper of sorts. <BR> <BR>thoughts?  thanks
