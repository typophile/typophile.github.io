  body: Scott I tend to like the last one, all the type on one line. It allows the
    other elements of the logo to dominate. I don&#39;t like the middle one why add
    another graphic element &#40;rule&#41;. I hope you win out, but clients

  body: 'hi scott -- i the bottom one works best . . . although the alignment seems
    a bit off. I would either pull the line of text so it aligns with the left and
    right of the logo or center the text &#40;the bottom one here is what you have

  body: 'Sally: <BR> <BR>I tried the mathmatical/literal alignment in ealier development
    of the logo w/out the &#34;HAYES GREEN BEACH&#34;, but it didn&#39;t seem to work
    visually. I have tried to create an optical alignment, or rather, balance. Similar
    to how the bottom edge of the &#34;G&#34; crosses the baseline, the bowl of the
    &#34;B&#34; crosses the imagined vertical line. The left side is a little more
    complicated with the graphic. I considered the direction of the angle, the overall
    shape and the lighter color of the graphic in determining relative balance between
    it and the byline. I could be wrong, but that was my reasoning. I used the old
    squinting technique'

  body: 'scott:  i see what you are trying to do, but IMO it looks off when you center
    it with the top edge of the tree icon instead of the bottom. <BR> <BR>IMO you
    should either align it with the B and the edge of the tree trunk or center it
    with the edge of the B and the lower corner of the icon. <BR> <BR>Hopefully someone
    else will give you their intake as well. May be just a personal preference. .

  body: 'SO far - my favorite is the centered between lower left and b &#40;sally&#39;s
    #2&#41;, but it might be the lines that are making that such a strong alignment.
    Would a full justification work - it came up in sally&#39;s previous post and
    it didn&#39;t look bad - it would get rid of the doubt.  <BR> <BR>I have to say
    though that I worry about this should it be presented at a much smaller size -
    you run the risk of fill in in letters like the R, A, P, etc. once it gets on
    press - partly will depend on stock. If you will keep it this size &#40;on one
    line&#41; could you maybe use a more open version of the face? <BR> <BR>What will
    the uses of this version of the logo be? Or will this be the &#34;official&#34;
    logo? <BR> <BR>I really wasn&#39;t against #1 in your original post, while I understand
    that you want to keep emphasis on HGB, I think that in the uses when it is necessary
    to have that identifying tagline, it should be easily legible. The problem is
    when you add in Hayes Green Beach &#40;something that is merely clarifying&#41;
    you end up having to reduce the Memorial Hospital &#40;something which is important
    information&#41;. Which do you sacrifice for the other? I think the sacrifice
    of Memorial Hospital at smaller sizes may be a little too much. However - I do
    think the size in the 1st one could come down or be lighter to make it recede
    a little more. <BR> <BR>Having said that mouthful - I love all three of your original
    concepts - very clean, very corporate - nice - I really like #2 hope you can use
    that for someone else someday.'
