  for examples of 70's era corporate use of helvetica, like for annual reports and
  such. ideally i'd like to find three or four corporate reports, for instance, that
  all basically look alike... international style but beyond bland. or it could be
  particularly boring ads from that period, etc.\r\n\r\nif anyone has any ideas, or
  actually has examples, i'd be much obliged.\r\n\r\nback to the editing room,\r\n\r\n-gary"

  body: I recall ARCO using Helvetica heavily in their identity during that period,
    putting big Helvetica markers on everything, including their oil storage tanks.
    I don't know how much of this survives since the merger with BP-Mobil.

  body: "Just another thought here, from someone who's been in the signage business
    a long time.\r\n\r\nHelvetica is an easy typeface to reproduce by hand. In the
    days when that's how things were done it was therefore a favourite with sign painters
    and silkscreen shops, where copy was often either hand drawn at the drawing table
    or laid out with Letraset, projected onto a wall traced, straightened up and hand
    cut in Amberlith or vinyl.\r\n\r\n"

      led to. \r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\n-gary"

  body: Although their work features in Lars' book, the book itself is much more interesting
    than their work. My librarian offered me a (very battered) withdrawn copy just
    the other week, which I'd be happy to send to you. Wasn't there also an Emigre
    issue about Helvetica Again? Letraset's <a/href="http://www.baselinemagazine.com/">Baseline
    magazine</a> might also have something from those heady, helvy years.

    did some advertising for Manville back in the 80s. (That link isn't mine, I just
    posted it because I haven't any scans.)\r\nEverything was Helvetica, including
    their logo, which was just a wordmark, I didn't use the symbol, which was cool,
    very minimal.\r\nIt was B2B, so I suppose you could say it was boring, if you're
    not excited by thermal insulation and plastic sewer pipe. Working for an agency
    that specialized in industrial advertising, I used Helvetica quite a lot. So I
    guess that colours my reaction to the new ad campaign for the National Ballet
    of Canada's <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, which is set in Helvetica (and not even
    a light weight). I'm thinking widgets, not tutus."

    I've just been browsing the Letraset Catalogue 1988; their spread on the Letrasign
    system shows a lot of Helvetica actually making everything look the same, regardless
    of whether it's a Mediaeval exhibit, 'personalised' golf bag or supermarket aisle.
    I seem to remember that Helvetica also featured largely in Letraset's own corporate
    style."
