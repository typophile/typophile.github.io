  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I want to use a number of TTF Chinses fonts in Photoshop as graphic elements.  Unfortunately, Windows can install non-english fonts, but cannot recognize them.  I hear that you can go to the &quot;Regions&quot; area in Control Panel, and add Chinese functionality, but naturally, I don't want to set my WHOLE PC to display nothing but Chinese!  Can anyone assist me in enabling the Chinese fonts so that Photoshop can use them to make vector font shapes in images, while retaining my english core WIndows funcationality???  I don't want to start fiddling with the core display attributes of Windows without knowing what I'm doing, of course.  Thanks in advance!!!</div>

In a pinch, you could move some of the glyphs in the font onto the Windows Latin 1252 codepage/Unicode range&hellip; <BR> <BR>Nate</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can indeed install Chinese language support on any Windows XP machine: all you do is go to 'Control Panel / Regional and Language Options' and check 'Install files for East Asian languages' on the Languages tab and then click 'Details' to view and edit language and keyboard support. Note that this will not change your operating environment to Chinese: it will just add fonts and IME for the language you select. (Note that you will need to have your XP install CD handy.) In the 'Text Services and Input Languages' window that opens when you click 'Details', click 'Add&hellip;' and then select the language and 'Keyboard layout/IME' for the language you want. Note that you will have several different options for Chinese depending on locale (Hong Kong, Macau, PRC, etc.) and then you will have several different options for IME. There are lots of different ways to input Chinese text, used by different communities across Asia. <BR> <BR>East Asian IME's work from a standard keyboard, but are generally based on a phonetic input method, which means you need to be able to speak Chinese in order to be able to use them. You start typing, e.g. using Pinyin transliteration, and the IME presents you with possible hanza characters that correspond to the sounds that you type. You then select the character you want, and then proceed. As I say, you really need to know what you are doing, and be proficient in one of the phonetic systems for transcribing Chinese. <BR> <BR>I've tested Chinese IMEs in PhotoShop 7 on Windows XP, and they work remarkably well. <BR> <BR>If you can't type Chinese in this way, and only need to use a few characters, another solution is to select your hanza characters by Unicode value, enter them in Wordpad, and then copy and paste into Photoshop. If you know the Unicode value of the characters you want to use, you can type the hexadecimal value in Wordpad, e.g. 7C73, and then hit alt+x immediately after the code value; this will convert the code value into the corresponding Chinese character. You can then select the character and copy and paste into Photoshop. <BR> <BR>IMPORTANT NOTE: I believe these suggestions may only work in Photoshop 7. Possibly in 6, but definitely not in 5.</div>

I have installed several Chinese fonts (with chinese file names), I also figured out how to type Chiense through Windows' own input system. But, I can&rsquo;t see any of these fonts listed in the fonts dropdown menu in my Photoshop! I can see them all in Word and other applications. What gives??</div>
