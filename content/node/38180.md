  pinpoint an answer to what I am sure is a remarkably stupid question:\r\n\r\nif
  a font comes with both book and roman faces, what is the difference in use intended
  to be? Is book optimized for a particular size? It appears a bit heavier...\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking specifically at Didot Elder as an example."

  body: "Books weights usually (but not always) have less contrast than their roman
    counterparts. This makes them more readable for running text. \r\n\r\nThere are
    some old threads with lots of details about this. Try using Google with the site:typophile.com
    keyword to find them\u2014the Typophile search engine doesn\u2019t work very well."

  body: "Using 'roman' to refer to a specific font within a family, e.g. synonymous
    with regular, seems really dumb to me, since as an adjective it could be legitimately
    applied to any weight of upright type in the roman style (as distinct from blackletter,
    civilit\xE9, etc.). A 'book' font in this style is just as much roman as any other
    weight."

  body: 'I think some of the confusion in the naming of fonts within a family is because
    some of the terms refer to weight (e.g. light, regular, bold), whereas others
    I regard more as optical size descriptors (e.g. book, text). When I see a font
    described as book or text, I expect that it''s meant to be used at around 10-12
    points in body text. So you could have book (or text) light, book regular, book
    bold. John Hudson is right: "roman" is simply a style descriptor--i.e. bold roman,
    bold italic. If there is no style descriptor, it''s assumed to be roman.'
