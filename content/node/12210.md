body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Mrs Eaves</strong>\r\n\r\nMrs Eaves was
  designed by [[Zuzana Licko]]. The font is named for [[John Baskerville]]'s lover,
  is a mildly stylized [[Baskerville]] [[revival]] known for its profusion of colorful
  [[ligature]]s and \"petite caps\", a unique variation on the theme of [[small capitals|small
  caps]]. Mrs Eaves is a technical tour de force, formerly being accompanied by a
  program from [[LettError]] intended to help designers manage its unwieldy set of
  ligatures, and was recently converted  by [[John Butler]] into an overwhelmingly
  full-featured [[OpenType]] family. Mrs Eaves is beloved by graphic designers but
  some typographers and type designers question its fitness for use in body text,
  primarily because of concerns about how the design is spaced.\r\nTo gain a better
  understanding of the solutions and problems that are associated with Mrs Eaves,
  one should read <a href=\"http://emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=109\">Licko's rationale</a>
  for designing the font. There are also several threads on Typophile that discuss
  the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/687\">virtues and shortcomings</a> of Mrs
  Eaves, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14884\">what to pair</a> with this typeface,
  and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13084\">suitable alternatives</a>.\r\n\r\nMrs
  Eaves is available through [[Emigre|Emigre]] at http://www.emigre.com. "
