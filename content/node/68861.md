  find examples of typefaces from different categories.\r\n\r\nThe ones I'm stuck
  on are these:\r\n\r\n\u2022 humanist axis\r\n\u2022 vertical (rational axis)\r\n\u2022
  implied vertical axis\r\n\u2022 no axis\r\n\u2022 sloped roman\r\n\r\nIf someone
  could please post examples and/or links to definitions of these categories (I've
  searched in books and on the net to no avail), that would be terribly appreciated
  :-)\r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\nSteph"

    those fonts in which the italics haven't specific letter shapes (i.e. single-storey
    a), but are just a slanted version of the roman (upright) ones."

  body: "Here's a great thread about sloped romans, with lots of examples: http://typophile.com/node/29998\r\nBasically,
    as you might know the classic concept is that Italics have different structures,
    which are closer to handwriting/calligraphy, including also some specifically
    differing letter shapes as Riccardo pointed out. This is what a sloped roman avoids.
    It is instead built upon the same structure as its accompanying Roman face, but
    slanted &ndash; of course not just mechanically though, a good sloped roman (also
    \xABslanted roman\xBB) is also a lot of work to design too (for one thing, the
    curves have to be re-balanced). \r\nI would think that is the big difference to
    the \xABfaux italic\xBB, which is just that, faux, means that if you hit the \"I\"
    button in Word on a font that doesn't have an italic, you get an artificially
    slanted version of the Roman, which generally looks horrid. Different thing.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the axes, I'm assuming you're looking for the stress/contrast axis, which
    in humanist typefaces is usually slanted (\xABdiagonal stress\xBB), in modern
    fonts [more] vertical. Compare the \"o\" of maybe a Garamond and a Didot to see
    what I mean. There are millions :-) of correct examples for these ones, the important
    thing is to learn how to look at/see them.\r\nI assume \xABno axis\xBB would be
    used for a font with no weight contrast, like Futura or something, but I'm not
    sure."
