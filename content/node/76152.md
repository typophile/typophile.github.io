  that resembles an embellished engravers, similar to fonts used on currency, but
  more fanciful.  Like this, only much nicer.  This, I think, is rather blunt and
  vulgar. \r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/prt_game2_thumb_5539.jpg]\r\n\r\n

  no help at all. \r\n\r\nWhat are your favorite fonts (or EPS resources) for something
  like this? "
