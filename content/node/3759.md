  my hectic schedule I never seem to have enough time to myself to pursue other interests
  like creating type, drawing, or other design discplines...it is my aspiration to
  be skilled in all facets of design...is there any advice one can share in terms
  of pursuing ones interests or how one should go about being a &#34;rennaisance&#34;
  man?

    too short to try to be an expert at everything. If you focus on one thing, you&#39;ll
    have a better chance of succeeding IMHO. I&#39;m not saying having hobbies is
    bad &#40;I&#39;ve got plenty&#41;, but they should stay hobbies.

    is charge higher prices for your web design projects.. evening out supply and
    demand. This allows you to have more time for fewer clients and maybe a bit left
    over for yourself. This solution works really great... in theory. maybe someday
    i&#39;ll find out if it really works when i&#39;m in demand.

    It might seem paradoxical, but I think it makes sense when you consider how different
    the two tasks are. Type designers don&#39;t make visual compositions - we make
    little machines. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>True, but many type designers are very good <i>typographers</i>, which
    suggests that the big gap is between type and graphics. Give me a text, and I
    can design and typeset it so it will be a pleasure to look at and read, but don&#39;t
    tell me you want it to be graphically exciting, sell widgets to housewives, etc.

    me to work in different media fields. i design print but leave the pre-press and
    production matters to others. i design websites but leave the coding and programming
    to others. i design typefaces but leave the distribution to others. and eventhough
    i also work as art director in the advertising field i still have time for my
    family, vacations, the gym, a social life, plenty of sleep, my ps2 and visiting
    online forums. <BR> <BR>this only works because i have partners in my network
    that i can depend upon at all times, each an expert in his/her field. the output
    is therefore of high quality in combination with high efficiency, which as a result
    allows me/us to charge higher rates, but not as high as those of agencies that
    offer a similar quality. <BR> <BR>so, eventhough it&#39;s hard and takes a lot
    of time to find the right partners, i would say that networking is the way to
    go today. i&#39;ve been working like that for many years and it definately works
    for me. <BR> <BR>simon

    graphic design, i.e. design in which text is entirely subservient to visuals.

    I don&#39;t have a valid vacation for 3 years now and used the company vacations
    in August on very important works. <BR> <BR>So, this post came out on it&#39;s

    turn on my computer and work on my freelancer work &#40;mainly ID&#39;s &amp;

    to make a wrong decision than keep on trying everything at the same time and never

    This makes practical sense, and also explains how it is possible to be a first
    rate typographer and have neither interest in nor aptitute for the broader discipline
    of graphic design. <BR> <BR>This is not to say that such a typographer might not
    be capable of some kinds of extra-typographic design, but he will probably approach
    them in the same spirit as he designs and sets type. I&#39;m thinking here of
    Jan Tschichold&#39;s covers for Penguin, which frequently employed illustration
    and other non-textual, graphic elements but always in a typographic context: the

    girl before, I blame this on the fact that I literally want to know everything
    and try everything and I&#39;m extremely stubborn at this. <BR> <BR>If I were
    you, I&#39;d try to learn the very basics and widest aspects of each thing you
    want to know. These are less likely to change over time &#40;instead of keeping
    up to date with the latest fonts, learn how to kern well. This can apply to everything&#41;.
    I&#39;d ask people around for which books are best for learning certain things
    and also finding good resource sites with forums like this one where people can
    learn off each other.  <BR> <BR>Another advice would be to keep in good physical
    shape &#40;and mental shape should come with it at the same time&#41;. I used
    to think working out twice a week was 2 hours less in my schedule, in fact it&#39;s

  body: 'Hello Everyone. <BR>This thread is very timely for myself, for the juggling,
    flailing, mixing of many fields has been one of glorious disaster and horrible
    triumph for me.  <BR> <BR>Last Saturday, I had what I considered my most fruitful
    day of work ever: up by 6am, read a good portion of Chaplin&#39;s autobiography,
    set three pages of type for a book of poetry, read about Elizabethan drama, wrote
    5,000 words of my novel, finally structured the short film I&#39;m shooting on
    Friday &amp; Saturday and then read some letters of Lord Byron. I was in a strange
    exhausted sort of ecstasy following some time with Bach searching for the themes
    in his variations, content with the days work. <BR> <BR>But the next few days
    were pure hell, the deepest depression I&#39;ve ever had. In my more coherent
    moments, I have accused that terrifyingly perfect Saturday of ruining my mind,
    which already was unfocused for decades but not to such a complete degree of fruitfulness.  <BR>
    <BR>It seems that discipline and a time of reflection before and after the time
    of work is absolutely necessary. Probably keeping my body in shape is a good idea,
    too, though I haven&#39;t extended my discipline to that area of life. <BR> <BR>Personal
    routine: <BR>everyday I must do three of these four things, and must never skip
    the same thing three days in a row: 1. Memory Palace &#40;don&#39;t ask&#41; 2.
    read fiction 3. read non-fiction: aesthetics or philosophy or history 4. draw
    <BR> <BR>If I do not do these things, I do not allow myself to work on any of
    my projects. It&#39;s harsh, but it seems to have worked. Notable on Saturday
    was that I did not prepare myself and on Sunday and Monday I was unable to do
    the routine &#40;family, teaching, etc&#41;.  <BR> <BR>But I am young and certainly
    foolish. I registered for typophile before finding this thread and I used a quote
    from my own novel &#40;forgive me&#41; to attach to my profile. I don&#39;t know
    if it will appear on this post, but it had to do with Leonardo da Vinci and his
    own dissatisfaction with his life. I fully expect to have the same dissatisfaction,
    but I doubt it will be for nearly as a great a body of work. <BR> <BR>A body of
    work, a corpus, is exactly that. The final assessment of a person&#39;s life comes
    as they are finally making their house in order as death draw&#39;s near. I&#39;ve
    fought to keep notions of success out of my head, and failed all too often: perhaps
    I should listen to that clear-thinking rascal Schopenhauer, and simply live.  <BR>
    <BR>I feel blessed that type is a part of that living. <BR>~h'

    more&#41;, I would strongly suggest to read Le mythe de Sisyphe by Albert Camus
    &#40;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been translated in english and many other languages&#41;.
    It&#39;s about the absurd. If you don&#39;t kill yourself while reading it, you
    should be good to go for a while and not worry about stuff =&#41;

    <BR> <BR>Emilie, I&#39;m glad you mentioned Camus because by sheer accidental
    and wholly american association, I think of Gide. His Lafcadio is one who must
    be thought of and emulated when thinking of the Renaissance man &#40;doubtful
    term though it is&#41; and intending to keep suicide far from home. For to Lafcadio
    was given the gift of laughter &#40;forgive this sententious speech, laced with
    words like sententious&#41;, which Bataille embraced so strongly. Such joy is
    the only thing to give life to a person that tries to &#34;do everything,&#34;
    which we all know is an impossibility and truly something ridiculous. A man who
    writes and wishes to preserve his text in type, must &#40;or may&#41; learn the
    art of typography [this sentence seems absurd now that I reread it]. A storyteller,
    if he believes that medium is as important as the message &#40;a typographer&#39;s
    attitude if ever there was one&#41;, may try to learn as many different media
    as he feels are necessary to telling the story the best way possible &#40;be it
    book, film, poem, play etc&#41;. But the despair which follows, something I recently
    experienced, is more likely to be based in fear than utter disappointment. Recall
    that in my post above, I considered it to be a &#34;successful&#34; day. Blasted
    wondrous life of paradox. Thus, Lafcadio to your Sisyphus. &#40;Les Caves du Vatican
    is translated into English as Lafcadio&#39;s Adventures, by the way
