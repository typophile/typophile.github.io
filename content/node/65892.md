  font to a retailer and everything is OK - except the following message that I just
  received:\r\n\r\n\"When I install the font in Mac OS X (I used 10.4), the character
  preview in Font Book is completely blank.\"\r\n\r\nAs I work on PC I not really
  know what would be the problem. Export setting related? Other? \r\n\r\nCould someone
  please help me or suggest something to try? \r\n\r\nMaybe it is a simple problem,
  but I just know what would cause this.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."

    depends on the \"language\" of the font. So a korean typeface would show a korean
    preview even if it contains latin characters too.\r\nUnfortunately I don't know
    what trigger this behaviour."
