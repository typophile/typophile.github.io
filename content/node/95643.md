  directly below, all of \r\n\r\nwhich follows this disclosure shall be deemed to
  be hypothetical. Consequently, as soon as the sole \r\n\r\nquestion asked in said
  email is answered to my satisfaction, I will release all who may read these \r\n\r\nand
  the following words from their bond of Willing Suspension of Disbelief, at a time
  and in a \r\n\r\nmanner of my choosing. My word is my bond.\r\n\r\nHere begins the

  \ \u25BC\r\n\r\n NICHOLAS CURTIS\r\n\r\n    kipnick@msn.com\r\n\r\nTo cvasil@supremecourt.gov\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAs
  a party to a potential lawsuit involving actual monetary loss and irreparable damage
  to my \r\n\r\npersonal and professional reputation, I leave it to your discretion
  to advise me of my best course \r\n\r\nof action as outlined here\u2014\r\n\r\nhttp:/
  \ /www.supremecourt.gov  /ctrules/  tocounsel_07rulesrevisions  .aspx\r\n\r\nNote:
  two additional single spaces have been placed between otherwise contiguous elements
  in order \r\n\r\nintentionally to avoid algorithmic misinterpretation of the contents
  of this message.\r\n\r\nMy dilemma: I have a potential lawsuit form monetary damages,
  which makes me an interested party. \r\n\r\nThe potential plaintiff, curiously,
  controls the most extensive inventory of Supreme-Court-approved \r\n\r\ntypefaces.
  Therefore, there are no disinterested parties to this suit, and therefore the majority
  \r\n\r\nof the parties involved\u2014defendant, plaintiff, nor the Supreme Court
  itself\u2014have an enormous \r\n\r\ndisincentive to comply with the amicus curiae
  provisions of this ruling\u2014unless, of course, the \r\n\r\nmeaning of the term
  \"certain\" is certainly, indisputably and indubitably unambiguous when said \r\n\r\nbrief
  is filed.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which should be painfully obvious by now, should the
  highest court in the land become a \r\n\r\nparty to this hypothetical suit, who
  is duly authorized to disambiguate.\r\n\r\nYours in confusion,\r\n\r\nNicholas J.

  VA 22306\r\n703-765-1636\r\n\r\nCommunications through the most secure channels
  highly recommended.\r\n\r\nHere ends the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
  the truth of the email first referenced above.\r\n\r\nGiven by my hand, and entrusted
  to my soon-to-be-former colleagues and assigns, so that they may \r\n\r\nbear witness
  to the veracity of all of my forgoing words.\r\n\r\n[Signed] Nicholas J. Curtis\r\nCitizen
