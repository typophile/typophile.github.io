body: "Hi folks, this looks like something I thought I had seen before, but I have
  had no luck locating it. The letters seem rather crudely shaped, but they appear
  consistent enough to think it's a font. I searched Dafont, and \"1800s\" at MyFonts,
  as well as several of my type books. I suspect a revival, perhaps by an amateur.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  recognize it?  \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joannie_young_4756.gif]"

  body: "Thanks Lex. I see the resemblance, especially the 'a'. My own candidate for
    a starting point was Ray Larabie's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/goodfish/\">Goodfish</a>,
    with a substituted 'a', but if either of these were used, then strange things
    were done to the 'u' (maybe a flipped and tweaked 'n'?)\r\n\r\nIf I were trying
    to re-create this I think I'd use letters from both fonts, but I have to say the
    work looks very clumsy and amateurish. (Probably about what I'd be capable of
    ;-))\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
