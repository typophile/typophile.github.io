  body: James, great new icon! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>As for the free download, I fear you&#39;ll have
    to look for yourself, TM. <BR>As ITC Machine is a commercial font, any free download
    is a rip-off  <BR>and it is against Board policies to point to those. Sorry&#39;boutthat.

  body: Same to you, Yves! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> The new Yves no longer shouts his love of type but is
    a man of intriguing, sepia mystery.
