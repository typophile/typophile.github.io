  body: Consider the widespread use of the &#34;left single quote&#34; as an apostrophe,
    for the abbreviation at the begining of a word &#40;eg &#39;05, rock &#39;n&#39;
    roll&#41;. <BR> <BR>This mistake is actually a default of Quark and InDesign,
    a &#34;side-effect&#34; of their attempt to replace the &#34;improper&#34; hash-mark
    with a curly quote. The best intentions...
