    don't know this one, possibly hand-drawn too. reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dear-alison/bender-script|Bender

    body: "Yeah, the idea is to draw it by hand myself too, but based on a good font,
      so I got a direction where to go. The letter \"Z\" is sometimes a hard one to
      capitalize, and my logo (brand) starts with a \"Z\" :) \r\nThanks for the tips
      ! "
