  <BR> <BR>I discuss a new monoline blackletter I spotted in a design magazine &#40;I
  &#42;think&#42; it was one of the most recent Print annuals, but it could have been
  elsewhere&#41;. The details are in the other post, but I&#39;ll add that some of
  the capitals were particularly ornate, and overall the font seemed more complex
  than the PhrackSle I compare it to in the other posting. Anyone have any ideas?
