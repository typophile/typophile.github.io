    still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death is in them,
    to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.\" \r\nNot as
    catchy, i know.\r\n"

  body: "Putting ink on paper has been done in a number of ways, especially in the
    20th century. What is a \"good\" typeface depends on how that was done -- letterpress?
    offset? And within offset, repro-negative-plate, or direct to plate? And within
    a repro-negative-plate workflow, was the repro pulled from metal fonts, or photocomp
    fonts?\r\n\r\nRefining that further, in the photocomp days, type was proprietary.
    What might be a good font on a Linotype 202 might not be a good font on a Monotype
    VideoComp.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nThough if you're asking about *design* without regard
    to putting ink on paper, you might get different answers."
