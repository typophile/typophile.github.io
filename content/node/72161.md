  that erroneous keystrokes don't add extra characters? I find that I somehow manage
  to add 'h's all over the place when kerning.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEDIT: This would
  be different than just simply locking the object\u2014one would still be able to
  interact with the type with regard to spacing and placement but additional letters
  and numbers cannot be added."
