body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontID3.jpg]\r\n\r\ngreetings, i was wondering
  if anyone knew of a font similar to the look from this 1960s poster font; it's casual,
  handwriten-looking, with some flair and fun.\r\n\r\ni've been looking for hours
  on font ID sites, and haven't really found any font sets that match, but i remember
  seeing some a few months ago, any help, tips, advice, appreciated\r\n\r\nbig thanks\r\ndem"

    married this summer, and she's registering for a bunch of items in that color
    scheme. I think it's cool, even though in a few years it may look kind of dated
    (again.)\r\n\r\nBut hey, all my mom's wedding stuff is avocado green and harvest
    gold with Strawberries on it. You can so tell she got married in 1975. :)"
