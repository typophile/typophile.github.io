  far as I know there are no digitizations of this style (House Industries' Studio
  Sable is similar). I want to make a font out of it, and was wondering if anybody
  knows of any lettering specimen where I might find a full alphabet of this style,
  or similar, to get a feel for how the other letters should look, rather than just
  expanding the charset myself by guesswork. I'm in Thailand so any physical book
  is going to be hard to get hold of. Maybe there's a flickr or other online resource
  that I've not been able to find? It won't be a straight revival, so even low res
  images would be helpful. I just want to get a feel of how it should look, then make
  it from scratch.\r\nCheers,\r\nDave"

  body: "The problem with hand lettering and research is there may not be a complete
    specimen of lettering you wish to digitize. Often lettering styles were handed
    down from a \"master\" (for lack of a better term) to apprentices with no formal
    specimen. Sometimes styles were the personal invention of the sign-writer cobbled
    together from pieces they picked up. Others were the adaptation of print letters
    to hand lettered brushwork. Some styles of lettering were completely regional.
    Worse, sign-writers could vary the letters from one basic format to produce cursive
    scripts, casuals (or money strokes), italics, or  calligraphy on the fly. Each
    would have the same characteristics but with a different brush or treatment each
    would be a completely different font by modern standards. There are several books
    covering hand lettering available, Speed Ball, Atkinson, Becker, etc., but don't
    be surprised if you can't find this variation.  The end result will generally
    be a collection of specimens and samples. From this you will build your font.
    Another possibility is to find an old sign painter or calligrapher to make a specimen
    and hope that he or she can duplicate this lettering.\r\n\r\nEven if you find
    a complete specimen, there is no way to copy it verbatim. Such demonstration specimens
    were meant as  guides only. The artists were expected to adjust each character
    to fit the application. I've heard purest say that their font was a true representation
    of the font as presented in the specimen. This means that it is crap. Hand lettered
    specimens are not composed as iron clad rules but rather as guides. Stroke widths,
    x-heights, character width, etc. will look great as long as all you do is spell
    out the glyphs as originally rendered. Anything else will need correction. \r\n\r\nSo,
    good luck and good hunting. Please don't listen to me. There is probably a real
    expert around here somewhere who will completely refute everything I've written,
    and he or she is probably right. I only know from personal experience. I am still
    working on my script and I had a decent specimen.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: Yeah, I've looked through the Filmotype collection and Sudtipos Bluemlein
    collection. I don't think I'd be stepping on anyone's toes too much by digitizing
    this (as a font, not a perfect tracing of lettering!). I figured a near exact
    match in a lettering style guide would not exist; I was just after something close
    enough to help me deal with the typical problem letters like x, z, k and then
    maybe find something that could work as a matching upper case. I've gathered a
    collection of lettering styles (via Google image search) from 30s to 60s, and
    hopefully I'll have enough to do a kind of mash-up, but keep it a consistent looking
    face. I'm not into revivals, I just really like the feel of this sample. We'll
    see how it goes...

  body: Sounds like you are on the right path. If you run into any serious problems,
    there are at least a couple of sign builder forums that still have sign painters
    involved. They might be able to come up with a good specimen. There are some excellent
    hand letterers on this sight, but they haven't chimed in yet. You may need to
    revise your post title to get their attention.

    as a similar style. I think the sample I found has a more condensed and bolder
    feel, but these scans will be really useful in working out some basic letter shapes
    before seeing where the design goes. It was the g and y in the advert that got
    me liking it so much, so hopefully I can get a lot of the feel of those letters
    into the others. I think if I use these scans together with some samples I've
    already found for inspiration, I can make something new, which won't look like
    a Hipster Script rip-off.\r\n<blockquote>and Kwaktur too</blockquote>\r\nThanks!

    are a lot of different version of each revival. So you can choose, for example,
    the Caslon or the Baskerville that best fit your taste or your intended use, or
    the one that gives you best results under different printing methods, or the one
