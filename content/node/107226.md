  body: "P and R really clash with the design of E, M and I.\r\nOn the basis of this
    sample I would see it as a particularly awkward font that is neither fish nor
    fowl.\r\nThat's not to say that somebody did not make it as a font.\r\nUnless
    there are more letters with these conflicting styles, I suspect that this may
    be somebody's idea of an eye catching word.\r\nDon"
