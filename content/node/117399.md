  now I'm trying to turn a capital P into an R. I'm not sure if this is the kind of
  leg I should use or not, but so far it's the only one that has looked ok. Hoping
  for some advice / critique on this. Thanks so much!\r\n\r\nR:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-R1.gif\">\r\n\r\n<img

  body: I agree that it looks great, but it is too wide. The original is a condensed
    design and the new leg extends outward too much. Otherwise, good job!

  body: Thanks George, I appreciate the useful feedback. Spot on. I'd love for you
    to take a look at the finished design when it's done (I'm about 1/3 of the way
    through the rest of the letters now) and tell me if you still think the leg extends
    too far. I agree with you that normally it shouldn't, but as the leading character
    in the logo I wonder if it won't end up looking better over-extended as it is
    now. Can't wait to get the rest of the characters finished so we can see in context!

  body: "Your design of the leg has a lot of flair, No matter how you make it narrower
    it's going to loose some of this. Here is one possible starting point. This is
    clip & paste on a jpeg image. In vector the curves of the leg could be improved
    considerably.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P2Rtest_4311.jpg] \r\nThe bowls
    on _R_ are often do not descend as far as the bowls on _P_. An idea might be to
    shift the bottom of the bowl on _P_ upward before doing this type of leg for the
    _R_.\r\nDon"

    This one looks more Victorian.\r\nDon"
