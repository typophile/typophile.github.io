body: "I'm pretty sure the \"Kate Moss\" type is custom, but I'm interested knowing
  what typeface it's inspired/derived from. The second image (Edita) is from a newer
  issue, but I believe it's an older font. I'm curious to know which both typefaces
  are, but I'm also interested in suggestions of similar faces.\r\n\r\nThank you."
