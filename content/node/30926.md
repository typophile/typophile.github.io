    Yes it has some controls - but if you are really going to set type - please use
    Quark or InDesign.\r\n\r\n"

    aligned left. I want to know how to make the perfect justified text(a perpect
    box shaped text) with ILLUSTRATOR program.

    the best looking text or adjust the size of the text so it fits your width better.
    This is the only way to do it unless you want to do it by hand.\r\n\r\n"

    settings for justification. Make sure that letter spacing is all zero. Note that
    this will porbably give you strange spaces between the words."

  body: "In general, the quality of your text justification will be directly proportional
    to the length of your measure. With a short measure, any typesetting application,
    Adobe Illustrator included, will be forced to add large amounts of word or letter
    spacing to justify your text. Assuming that  this is not the issue at hand, here
    are a few of things you could try:\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>Advance Justification Options</dt>\r\n<dd>Thankfully,
    even Illustrator offers some advanced options for text justification. You could
    try adjusting the minimum, maximum and desired settings for word, letter and glyph
    spacing.</dd>\r\n<dt>Hyphenation</dt>\r\n<dd> When enabled, hyphenation should
    improve the quality of text justification. Illustrator offers advanced options
    here as well.</dd>\r\n<dt>Single-line vs. Every-line Composer</dt>\r\n<dd>When
    the Single-line Composer is enabled, Illustrator will adjust word spacing on a
    per line basis. Contrastingly, the Every-line Composer will reflow all lines of
    text in an attempt to normalize word spacing and therefore improve justification.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nAll
    of these advance settings can be found in the additional options dialog of Illustrator's
    <em>Type&raquo;Paragraph</em> window."

    equivalent to InDesign's. I'd argue that thanks to the paragraph composer, both
    Illustrator and InDesign have better justification than QuarkXPress. (You may
    choose to think that as an Adobe employee, of course I'd think that. But it's
    my honest opinion.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas,\r\n\r\nI do page layouts all day long in the States. I deal with
    one art director in Paris who wants everything done in Illustrator. I'm sorry,
    but when one is laying out a 40 page brochure -- and page 6 is being moved to
    page 13, and 21 is half left on 21 and the other half moved to page 30 and followed
    by page 30 is now 31 and toss 31... one who is aware of production and production
    time stays within a page layout program.\r\n\r\nif you are designing - or doing
    1 say, poster, book cover, etc. yes, by all means have fun in Illustrator...\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    as I wrote before use Quark or Indesign.\r\n\r\nAnd I honestly couldn't care less
    if you were an Adobe employee - glad you have employment. When something works
    - why fix it. I'm an original Beta and Gamma tester of Quark - and it is like
    second nature to me. I'm at the stage, I'm an old dog - and sorry I don't want
    to learn new tricks - I just want the job done right the first time."

      tend to turn it off and just do my breaks manually. It hate the way you sometimes
      get all the word space nicked out of a line when you have APC switched on. Seems
      better in the long run, maybe because I prefer to trust my eyes.\r\n\r\nBy the
      way, with reference in the movie you linked to, the right hand par wasn't really
      the best example to use, as the last three lines get progressively shorter.
      Maybe the word \u2018in\u2019 on the second line could have come up (if the
      measure would allow). \r\n\r\nIf not, wouldn't one (if one were a person responsible
      for setting copy for training videos) just re-write the dummy copy to fit nicely?\r\n\r\nAlso,
      the overhanging double quote shown next seems a nat's too far overhung, don't
      you think?\r\n\r\nChris"
