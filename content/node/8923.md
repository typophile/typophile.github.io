body: I had no idea the SF Weekly was at the Film Fest. Anyway, this week&#39;s Books
  and Arts supplement contains <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/issues/2005-01-26/culture/books.html">a
  rundown of the event and critical appraisals of the films</a>. I think the writer
  may have developed a little crush on Jared.
