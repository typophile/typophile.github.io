    Gothic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-gothic/ Burin Sans http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/burin-sans/
    Sweet Sans http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/sans/ or several other similar fonts
    \r\nMr. and Mrs. Robinson are small and fuzzy but the letters and the ampersand
    seem consistent with Sackers Gothic, Burin Sans, or Sweet Sans. Don't think it
    makes a lot of difference which of these three you use for the these parts of
    the fonts.\r\nDon"
