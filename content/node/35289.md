  body: Looks like someone got a hold of Irvin, the <em>New Yorker</em>'s typeface.
    Wiescher's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/wiescher/newyorkertype/">New
    Yorker Type</a> is one interpretation.

  body: "If you search on 'Irvin' at this site you will find a thread with a comparison
    of at least three digital versions as well as see a sample of the true Irvin,
    which was a metal type from the late 20's. (I would have found it, but I am using
    a browser that can barely open these pages, and it would take forever.)\r\n\r\n-
