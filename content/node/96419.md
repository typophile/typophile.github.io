  body: "I's a not a very expensive font actually. If you always seek a free version,
    how do you expect a professional font designer to make a living and offer us more
    well designed & beautiful fonts?\r\nAnyway, I don't know any free versions of
    this font."

    projects, you have to be a real cheapskate to insist on a freebie.\r\n\r\nBTW,
