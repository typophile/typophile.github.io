  about two years ago ( http://typophile.com/node/722 )\r\n\r\nI'm beginning a new
  font, base on the upper A of that old attempt.\r\n\r\nI guess the reason I couldn't
  finish that first one was because the form of the characters were too unusual, and
  togheter, they didn't match and were too uneven.\r\n\r\nOn my new shoot, I'm thinking
  about making more usual forms, and having the \"opened and fresh look\" only on
  some single characters...like A a g (for now)\r\n\r\nAnyway... this is my first
  roughs on the computer:\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nthks a lot!!"

  body: Interesting. Using the idea of gestalt to complete the form. The smaller you
    preview it the more complete the shapes become. Keep going.

    colleague on other forum.\r\n\r\nHere is a PDF to help you take a closer look...\r\n\r\nMiss
    Tiffany, thks, this gestald effect is indeed interesting: as the smaller we preview,
    more complete the shapes will be. On this PDF I have previewed various sizes to
    check this out easily. Thks for your comment again.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.focodesign.art.br/bytype/after_03.pdf\r\n\r\n\"see\"

  body: "For now, there is only one glyph who disturbing me. The g looks too me a
    double storey, did you try the one storey one? Other suggestion for the g is may
    be reduce the size of the bowl that seems to be to close of the o. Also the angle
    of the lower \xABstorey\xBB give an oblique aspect to the g.\r\n\r\nGood work,keep
    going.  "

  body: "Thanks Sim, I will try the single storey g. It may fit well on this font.\r\n\r\nSee,
    I've heard (and proved this in practice) that typedesign is 10% inspirarion (designing
    the concept) and 90% transpiration (the hard work on extending the concept over
    the entire font). Keeping this is mind, before I start designing the rest of the
    characters, I've made another version of n o a h, with shapes more fluid, really
    display like. You can compare this new version with the old one on this pdf (
    www.focodesign.art.br/bytype/After_03_04.pdf )\r\n\r\nLooking at a distance now,
    version 3 lowercases seem too rounded and \"correct\", like a text font lower
    characters. They don't seem to match the wildness of the cap A.\r\nVersion 4 have
    some straight angles and fits better with the cap A (my reference for inspiration).\r\n\r\nI'm
    stuck on this doubt...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I would reaaally appreciate everyones
    opinion...\r\n\r\nthks\r\nFabio"

  body: "Haag, your second attempt works well, but are you able to prepare a pdf file
    instead of gif file. I'm not sure if the ragged edge is a part of your typeface
    thats what the gif file give on screen. You could also insert a gif file in your
    post and add a pdf file in link.\r\n\r\nPersonnaly I prefere the version 4, the
    round curve of that forth version has a better look to me. Keep going and keep
    up in touch of your next develpment.\r\n\r\nBTW, is there a something new on the
    diplay typeface you talking about on your introduction?"

    body: "Hi Sim!\r\n\r\nAbout that 4th version you appreciated most... don't you
      think it is too similar as Dax, wich is beeing too used? Those lowercases have
      the same principles. And, since this my attempt is to project a display face,
      that needs to \"call attention to itself\" I guess it needs to differenciate
      as much as it can. I think the cut angles mixed wth some curve ones gives the
      characters a more particular feeling and contrast.\r\nBut I will for sure keep
      those characters for further development later.\r\n\r\nHere is a new PDF (I
      hope this one works... please tell if it doesn't) and also a GIF:\r\n\r\nwww.focodesign.art.br/bytype/After_06.pdf\r\nwww.focodesign.art.br/bytype/After_06.gif\r\n\r\n\"see\"
