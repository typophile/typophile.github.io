  new site looks great, by the way! and is so much faster!)\r\n\r\n1. Does the initial
  post/topic have to be so HUGE???\r\n\r\n2. Links seem to open automatically in the
  same window - is there a way to set the preference so that they automatically open
  a new browser window? Also in the html formatting guide I don't see a way to do
  this.\r\n\r\n3. Can the FAQ anchor to the top like the Fontshop note?\r\n\r\nIf
  this isn't the right place to post this I'm sorry but I don't know who to direct
  this to..."

  body: I just notified Jared that -- after I made edits to the FAQ -- it became un-sticky.
    The moderator/administrator privileges still have to be sorted out in version
    2, so basically I can't do anything yet. As bug-squishing is absolute priority
    right now, please be patient.
