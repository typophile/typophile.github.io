body: "A 3 day long weekend crash course in type design is coming to SF, CA - Crafting
  Type Jan 10-12. It will be held at FontShop in the North Beach area. The class is
  geared to total beginners but people who have had a bit of experience and want to
  work on specific aspects of their design process are encouraged to come as well.
  \r\n\r\nThe idea behind the course is to either \r\n- give you a running start in
  type design so you have resources and insights needed to keep going or\r\n- give
  a typographer or any user of type insights into using type that can only come from
  making some\r\n\r\nIt is hard work because it is all day (9-6) for 3 days but it
  is also hugely fun. Students are routinely amazed at how far they have come in 3
  days.\r\n\r\nFor more background have a look at here http://craftingtype.com/\r\nTo
  sign up : https://www.tug.org/craftingtype/register-2014-01-sf.html\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  has questions please ask!\r\n\r\nWe are very grateful to FontShop for hosting us!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
