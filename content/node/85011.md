  de Groot\u2019s experiment</a> of alternating typefaces in every other paragraph
  of a newspaper, I threw together letters from both Univers and Helvetica and did
  some scaling. I used the open source versions of the fonts by URW.\r\n\r\nThe <a

  applies.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, to me the result looks more like Univers than Helvetica,
  and on Windows the hinting helps a bit to unify the appearance. Because of the different
  stem widths and weird spacing, in print it has the feel of an irregular typewriter
  or rub-down lettering face.\r\n\r\nCheck it out for yourself: http://www.kutilek.de/download/helvers.zip\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvers_4570.png]"
