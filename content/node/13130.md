  but is drawn like a real typeface, not as 'gridded' as the dot-matrix.\r\n\r\nI
  found a very similar font in a old letraset catalogue, where it went by the name
  of 'Pinball', it seems that it never made it into a digitized font. \r\n\r\nIt got
  used in the visual identity of the Olafur Eliasson installation at the Tate Modern.

  body: "I feel like we've seen this before and decided it was custom for the Tate.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    the thread I was thinking about referred to the Tate's main identity, which was
    designed by Wolff Olins. Dunno about the dot font, but could also be a custom
    font. It's nice.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/8405"
