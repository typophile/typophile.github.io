body: 'I''m currently working on a project for an interactive kiosk that is intended
  to be in shopping malls, airports, etc. The project uses the Emigre Cholla Slab
  Bold font to display dynamic text in some of the fields. My client just sent me
  a super panicky email that we shouldn''t use the font due to Emigre charging a licensing
  fee for every computer kiosk it''s on and it would drastically blow up the price
  of the project and we should go with a freebee font like Georgia instead. I''ve
  been working with fonts for decades and have never heard of this and while there
  is licensing info on Emigre''s site, I wonder how serious this is and much it is
  enforced? While I''ve never done a kiosk before, I''ve done a bunch of Flash projects
  using embedded fonts to display dynamic text fields and I''ve never had the font
  police come out to get me.


  So has anyone had experience like this? And if we do have to switch fonts does anyone
  know of a font like Cholla I can use without these licensing issues? '

  body: "If Emigre says that's the licensing terms, then that's the licensing terms.
    However, I'd like to think they'd consider some sort of site/bulk licensing for
    a project like this. You might want to call them and ask.\r\n\r\nIf you're are
    willing to stay within the ballpark style-wise, there is a great free typeface
    called Kontrapunkt (named after the firm that designed it) though, of course,
    it isn't nearly as large of a family as Cholla is.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kontrapunkt.dk/news/ddprize_typeface_of_the_year_2004\r\n\r\n"

    is generally accepted even if it often goes beyond many font EULAs or the embedding
    permissions encoded within the fonts) and installing the font on a bunch of kiosks.
    Would you consider it acceptable to stick unlicensed OS\u2019s,  music, video
    and images on the kiosk? Why is installing unlicensed fonts okay?\r\n\r\nAs for
    Georgia, that would need to be licensed as well, unless each kiosk had a licensed
    copy of Windows or Mac OS."

  body: "I assume a kiosk would still use some sort of embedding - maybe. Depends
    what they're building it in.\r\n\r\nCheck Emigre's site. They have a licensing
    portion that deals with embedding fonts. At the moment, it's $150 extra to license
    up to 30 fonts for embedding in flash + the cost of the standard font license.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I can tell the rules and fees vary a lot! You may need to call the font
    company to talk them through what you want to do.\r\n\r\nI would think the Adobe
    font library would be a very good choice if you need to worry about cost and legal
    issues. I'm sure they're very sympathetic to embedding their fonts in their own
    products! As far as I can tell they don't require any special licensing - though
    I may be wrong. I just haven't seen anything on their site about it."
