body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI am designing a display typeface in Fontlab. It has substitute
  ligatures for pretty much every letter combination (like A_A, A_B, A_C...etc). I
  want to put them all as discretionary ligatures. The code at the moment looks like
  this:\r\n\r\nfeature dlig {\r\n\tsub A A by A_A;\t\r\n\tsub A B by A_B;\r\n \tsub
  A C by A_C;\t\t\r\n\tsub A D by A_D;\t\r\n\tsub A E by A_E;\t\r\n\tsub A F by A_F;\t\r\n\tsub
  A G by A_G;\t\r\n\tsub A H by A_H;\t\r\n\tsub A I by A_I;\t\r\n\tsub A J by A_J;\t\r\n\tsub
  A K by A_K;\t\r\n\tsub A L by A_L;\t\r\n\tsub A M by A_M;\t\r\n\tsub A N by A_N;\t\r\n\tsub
  A O by A_O;\t\r\n\tsub A P by A_P;\t\r\n\tsub A R by A_R;\t\r\n\tsub A S by A_S;\t\r\n\tsub
  A T E by A_T_I;\t\r\n\tsub A T I by A_T_E;\t\r\n\tsub A T by A_T;\t\r\n\tsub A U
  by A_U;\t\r\n\tsub A V by A_V;\t\r\n\tsub A W by A_W;\t\r\n\tsub A X by A_X;\t\r\n\tsub
  A Y by A_Y;\t\r\n\tsub A Z by A_Z;\r\n\r\n.......(and will eventually go all the
  way to Z_Z)....\t\r\n\r\n} dlig;\r\n\r\nI am afraid it may end up being huge and
  perhaps make the font slow, although it is a display font so most probably it won't
  be used for huge chunks of text. \r\n\r\nIs there any other way to do it? I am not
  good at scripting and I've searched around but I couldn't find if there is another
  way to use classes to do it.\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is the only way, so far as I can see.
