    get your attention as any, to mention that I have spoken with Dermot McGuinne
    regarding cutting a new Irish font in metal. I am anxiously waiting for him to
    send me some source on the alphabet so that I will have some guidance on the letterforms
    in designing the new face. I gather from Frank&#39;s note to you that you are
    interested in Irish type. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep you informed as things progress.

    is somewhat worrying. He certainly works out: he&#39;s a competetive swimmer.'
