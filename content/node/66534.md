body: "Awhile back, the Metrics window in FontLab 5.0.4 started working in a strange
  way. Whereas previously, the window displayed my kerning pairs regardless of the
  labeling mode for the font as a whole, I can now only see kerning pairs if the font
  is set to codepages labeling. It's not a big deal, but it seems odd that this behavior
  just popped up one day.\r\n\r\nAnother slight annoyance is the Glyph Window. A few
  weeks back, I opened up a TrueType font with a UPM of 2,048; now, everytime I open
  a file, the default 100% size is 2,048, even though the vast majority of my files
  have UPMs of 1,000. Which brings to mind a pet peeve: is there any reason why FontLab
  doesn't have a simple Magnifying Glass tool, so that one does not have to step-zoom
  in? A hand tool would be nice, too..."

    but if you mean view in a glyph window, FontLab remembers last view. SO if you
    zoom to 50% and then close that window, it will remember that view next time you
    open a window.\r\n\r\nSo there is no ghosts really what you are talking about,

    And FontLab is Casper's favorite hangout.\r\n\r\nNick, since the title of this
    thread is nicely broad, if I may:\r\nWhen I have a non-English keyboard selected
    in Windows (XP Home), FontLab (5.0.4) does not snap to the letters when I hit
    them. And for Armenian for example it always snaps to the \"\u056F\"! Any fix?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>Hand tool? Press space.</em>\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip, but it appears
    that it's Press and HOLD space. I suppose Mac users are used to clumsy two-handed
    shortcuts.\r\n\r\n<em>Option-scroll is a handy way to zoom in/out.</em>\r\n\r\nYes
    and no: you still have to step-zoom, and the zoom (at least MY zoom) doesn't center
    on the character, so adjustments need to be made to center the glyph. This hit-or-miss
    approach usually doesn't occur with most magnifying glass tools.\r\n\r\n<em>I'm
    not sure what you mean with default 100% size, but if you mean view in a glyph
    window, FontLab remembers last view. SO if you zoom to 50% and then close that
    window, it will remember that view next time you open a window.</em>\r\n\r\nTheoretically,
    perhaps, but not practically: as I said, MY glyph window is stuck at a 100% 2,048-unit
    UPM view regardless of magnification at last window close, and invariably returns
    to that view on zoom-out. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The two zooming methods I use most frequently (I'm using the Mac version):\r\n\r\n-
    Hit the \"Z\" key to zoom in or the \"X\" key to zoom out.\r\n\r\n- Press (and
    hold) the space bar then the command key to get the zoom-in magnifying glass tool;
    add the option key to get the zoom-out tool. This works almost exactly as in Adobe
    apps.\r\n\r\nOne difference in the way zoom works in FontLab compared to Adobe
    apps is that the zoom is always oriented around the location of the mouse cursor.
    I find this preferable, but it's disorienting sometimes when switching between
    FontLab and Adobe apps.\r\n\r\nI also assign command-1 to the 100% view, which
    I don't think is the default."

  body: "> MY glyph window is stuck\r\n\r\nAFAIK FontLab remembers the zoom setting
    that's set in the zoom dropdown (manual calls it the \xABzoom popup menu\xBB)
    in the glyph window. If that's set to 100% as the standard zoom, new glyph windows
    will open at 100% no matter how much you've previously zoomed in/out using other
    tools or keyboard shortcuts. \r\nI might be missing something.\r\n\r\nI'd also
    like to second Hrant's question and ask if FontLab is generally immune to Non-Latin
    keyboard input? It doesn't seem to work for the preview window either."

  body: "Mark,\r\n\r\nTranslating your instructions into PC keys (CTRL for CMD and
    ALT for OPT) works for me: thanks for the info. However, it's just slighgtly this
    side of ridiculous that it takes up to three fingers and two hands to accomplish
    what a single, simple tool icon would do. But, then again, the number of tools
    packed in under CTRL/CMD T is also a nuisance. Maybe I'm just spoiled after years
    of working with CorelDraw, with its SINGLE tool to add or delete nodes; make segments
    lines or curves; make nodes sharp, smooth or symmetrical; and align, scale or
    rotate nodes. Oh, yeah: and a curve smoothing slider that actually allows for
    real finessing.\r\n\r\nAnd, Altaira, sorry: my default view is STILL stuck in
    a 2,048-unit UPM view and always returns there when opening a new glyph window...bummer."

  body: It is possible to activate the magnifying glass tool in FontLab without all
    the multi-finger acrobatics -- it's hiding under the name "Custom" in the Zoom
    menu. So you can add it to a toolbar using the Tools > Customize dialog for quick
    access. Unfortunately, there's no icon for it (though you can draw your own in
    Windows), and it immediately deactivates after using it.

    very simple reasons:\r\n- The curves between points are not restricted to the
    font's grid, they're restricted to the rasterizer's grid; so you need to see what
    they might (and often will) end up looking like. This is also why anti-aliased
    rendering in a font editor is great.\r\n- It's hard to control the mouse to the
    pixel. (In fact even when you're making a pixelfont it's very useful to zoom way
    in.)\r\n\r\nTry making the curve that connects the top of the right stem to the
    extremum in an italic \"n\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
