    it\u2019s indeed Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed.\r\nYou should trust Jan, he
    knows his Akzident Grotesks ;-)\r\n"

  body: Yes, thank you riccard. "Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed" is font which I
    wanted. If you look at both fonts -> "Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed" and "Akzidenz
    Grotesk Extra Bold Condensed" (which recommended Jan) there is few differences
    for example in letter "E" etc. So "Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed" is font which
    I thought. Thank you again riccard. :-)
