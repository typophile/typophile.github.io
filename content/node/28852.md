  a hold of some short basic [[EULA]]. It\u2019s for a free font that I will give
  away for free on my own website.\r\n\r\nSo nothing fancy is needed. I only want
  to say the most basic stuff. Everything is allowed when it comes to using the font
  etc, but not further sales or distribution in any form.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    let's see if I can find it. I think it is somwhere within <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14264">this

  body: ">I wonder which is the best way to build an EULA from zero.\r\n\r\nI've been
    thinking about this. We have a tool here where you answer a series of questions
    and out pops a EULA. Unfortunately I have to go to the paralegals office to answer
    the questions (maybe they don't trust me or maybe it's a Washington State Bar
    rule?) also some of the questions don't relate well to fonts. \r\n\r\nBut given
    the work that's already been done to encode the EULA (by FontLab et al) it should
    be possible to answer a set of questions and have a EULA pop out - sounds like
    a great project for MyFonts, FontLab or someone else to tackle.\r\n\r\nOf course
    the lawyers will hate this, but realistically they should spend their time going
    after the bad guys and not writing EULAs. "

    if you want to mention modification - you say the font can't be renamed (which
    is good form a TM protection standpoint) but don't mention other forms of modification.
    Also no mention of embedding.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

    You need to also clarify modifications, again, even if you allow all forms of
    modifications. \r\n- If Si gave you the MS EULA to start with don't be afraid
    to use it. It is far easier to explain a clause to a user than to not have something
    in your EULA to protect you.\r\n- You didn't specify how many users could use
    the software.\r\n- Can the user(s) use it on more than one device?"

  body: "Thanks for all replies :)\r\n\r\nSince it is a free font that I threw together
    rather quickly I decided to give it for free as a marketing strategy. I practically
    want people to surf to my website, get to know that there is a new type studio
    \"out there\". To connect and make some contacts \u2013 and (as a reciever of
    the font said) \u2013 make the world a little happier place :)\r\n\r\nAll kinds
    of embedding is allowed if it means that the user can embedd the font in a PDF
    or Flash-file. Embedding is btw something that I feel should be allowed in every
    font we buy, I think it should be 100% legit to send a PDF with the embedded fonts
    in it, so everybody could see what the designer did (if that\u2018s what you mean).
    Otherwise it\u2019s pretty meaningless to buy a font (in a users perspective)
    :) But maybe I miss something here? Are there other ways of embedding fonts?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not really confident in what all this means, but modifications sounds in my ear
    that a user opens the font in Illustrator and maybe change a little of the curves
    to maybe do a logo. If that\u2019s what embedding means, it is very much allowed.
    This is also something I feel should be legit to do with every font. I also work
    as a graphic designer and more than often when doing a logo I change small things
    to make it more unique. As long as you dont change the font itself and distribute
    it.\r\nPractically i just wanted something that claims it\u2019s not freeware
    but licenced by Autodidakt.\r\n\r\nRegarding how many users could use the software;
    If the font is personal for the person who got it, isnt it obvious that the font
    is only for the user that gets it? Or do we have to be very clear in these matters?\r\nThe
    only thing I really want to prevent is that some \"scam-person\" or company makes
    a copy and distribute it further, or sell to make money. That is the only thing
    that I would get upset if someone does. Do you think that\u2019s clear enough
    in the EULA? \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not very used with the \"legal\" terminology, and
    I also feel that if these kind of EULAs are to complicated, people just dont read
    them. I read the Village Eula and from a user point of view it was really great,
    I felt more sympathy for the font makers with an EULA like Village had. It was
    human in a nice way :)\r\nI tried to make some kind of mix of that. Dont know
    if I succeded. Do you feel I should add something to the EULA?"

  body: "Goran,\r\n\r\nI should add that I'm not a lawyer and I can only make recommendations
    based on my own experience as user of EULAs.\r\n\r\nTo distribute your font as
    freeware is generous, and it could generate traffic to your site as well. But,
    a few more thoughts for you to consider:\r\n\r\n- You should create a section
    in your EULA for embedding and then define it. Something simple such as Embedding
    is allowed in portable document files (PDF) and shockwave files (SWF). \r\n\r\n-
    Modifications in EULAs mostly (always) means opening the font in a program such
    as FontLab, making changing and regenerating a new font. Adobe allows for modifications,
    but they do not allow for distribution of the files. It might be useful for you
    to read Adobe's EULA (it is long, be prepared to read it calmly).\r\n\r\n- You
    might consider a clause dis-allowing people sharing it for download anywhere.
    There are so many crappy free font sites out there your font will just get pulled
    along into the muck and you will also lose traffic to your site.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/antipiracy/ff_faq.html\">Adobe's

    I know, this is terrible. The part about the further distribution in my EULA \u2013
    don\u2019t you think this covers that specific problem as this is a kind of distribution?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help :) I\u2019ve added the embedding part to the EULA.\r\n"
