  body: I like this, but some of your letters look "boring" in comparison with the
    detailedness of some of the others. Add in the third dimension on them, and this'll
    be slick. I'm speaking specifically of L, M, T, V, X, Y, and Z.

  body: "Looks nice, and Dan is right, add more details to the flat characters. I
    think this is possible to do, you've done it with the G for example, by folding
    the stroke, and even with the W.\r\nY and T could be the same principle as with
    U.\r\netc."

  body: 'I''d say as other Typophile member. Look nice and inspiring to me. I saw
    you''ve redraw some letter in adding more detail. The bottom of the U and the
    join of the Y should be more like the C, the D or the bowl of the B, R. The I
    would be nice, to my point of view, if he looks like the stem of the R. You still
    have to work mor on the Z and the L. '
