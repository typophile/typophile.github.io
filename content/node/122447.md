  without the shadows in several projects but this was the initial idea. The idea
  stems from blackletter decorations I saw in an old bible. \r\n\r\nComments are very
  welcome! \r\n\r\nThanks Kai \r\n\r\nFull projectlink: https://www.behance.net/gallery/22219973/Shadow-Font\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would suggest rearranging the shadows on letters that would make another
    letter if a part fell away. With imperfect vision and/or increased contrast, "E"
    becomes "F." and "L" becomes "I." The tail of "R" isn't quite shaped like punctuation
    but still seems a bit like a lost object lurking under a "P" all the same. Even
    if confusion is unlikely in practice, the differentiation will add more visual
    interest.

  body: "If you are attempting to produce a digital font version, as opposed to an
    eps format which allows gradual shading, check the discussions of the problems
    in in making a digital font of Roger Excoffon's Calypso type using a dot size
    variation. For example http://typophile.com/node/102099\r\nDon"

    in the \"U\") are ungainly (possibly because they're too geometric).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
