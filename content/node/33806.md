  body: That's what I originally thought, but this version seems to be a little condensed

    DIN</a> might be close enough for you? It comes close on almost every letter.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "That's the closest so far - the lower s is a little off, but looks pretty
    good.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can get closer than this, I would appreciate it. If not,
    then thanks for all the help guys!"
