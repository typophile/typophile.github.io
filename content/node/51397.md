  graduate programs in Europe. Feel free to throw in suggestions of schools in other
  continents... the point is to think outside of the States. \r\n\r\nI'm especially
  interested in France, so any info on programs there will be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks

    of Reading. READING, UK\r\nhttp://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    are the ones I know, cause I studied in both. \r\n\r\nReading is more focused
    on typography. Lahti Polytechnic has a very good program, with very talented students.
    They do graphic design and illustration together, I am sure this one has to be
    in the top five!\r\n\r\nSorry, both are far from France....\r\n"

    of what is going on there outside of the typographic scene. The new typographic
    hotspot may be Amiens. You could check this out \u2013 the local government even
    has scholarships for foreign students:\r\n\r\nhttp://esad-amiens.fr/\r\n"

  body: Be aware that The Gerrit Rietveld Academie does not offer a graduate program,
    only up to bachelor. I got my bachelor at the graphic design department, and it
    comes highly recommended. Truly one of the best and distinct programs in the world.
    A master in the spirit of the Rietveld would be Werkplaats Typografie.
