  body: "\"targeted for resume companies\"\r\nI don't know what this means. If it
    means the resume will be scanned into various databases, then the name (Christine
    Hoang) must be readable, not oblong-dot fonts or letters connected together top
    and bottom. Just a simple readable font.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience? and
    what is the goal of this resume? Are you seeking comments on the design or typography
    or wording of the resume? What? "

  body: "Hi Tillman. \r\nMy friend asked me to design a resume for her. She wants
    to send this resume to a video game company in hopes of being offered a position.
    I'm not sure what position she's trying to get. \r\n\r\nShe wanted the resume
    to stand out amongst the crowd.\r\n\r\nI was mainly seeking comments on the typography.
    Any other kinds of comments would be appreciated as well.\r\nTHank you."

  body: "For me there's too much going on, makes it difficult to keep the eyes reading
    sequentially as my eyes are going all over the place. \r\n\r\nI'm not clear on
    the difference between 'professional experience' and 'professional development'...the
    way it's chunked doesn't tell me what to expect in those sections. Also the fact
    there are ten positions since 2009 makes me *very* nervous.\r\n\r\nI'd make it
    all one tense: you have the first two jobs in present tense then a mix throughout.\r\n\r\nHelvetica?
    I'd go for something easier to read; Helvetica isn't great in short lines without
    masses of leading.\r\n\r\nNeeds proofing. On p.2 'DISCOVERSD' and 'vanalysis'.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm a tech writer and really don't deal with resumes or video game companies.
    But here is my opinion.\r\n\r\nChange the font to something more up-to-date, even
    if it's just Calibri. Helvetica is too old-school, for a hip video company.\r\n\r\nI
    would not out-dent the top level heading (Professional Development, Education,
    Computer Skills) as this does make me want to look to the left hand column to
    see if it goes with anything there. Just do a straight left alignment. \r\n\r\nLike
    Bendy, I can't tell the difference between Professional Experience and Professional
    Development. But I may be out of the loop on this. If you need to, just put a
    note under the words Professional Development to define it.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    with the top of this resume is that nothing is lined up. The name Christine Hoang
    is just plopped in there. Nothing is lined up vertically with the top of Christine's
    head. Nothing is lined up horizontally with the right column. Nothing is lined
    up and this needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nNote that underneath Christine's picture
    the three lines have a line spacing problem. And the two contact numbers really
    have no connection to the term \"The Game Changer\", which actually should be
    with Christine's name.\r\n\r\nHere's what I would do. Using only the first column,
    above Christine's picture, right aligned. Do not use all caps. Use the same font
    although maybe the first two lines are a little bit bigger:\r\n\r\nChristine Hoang\r\nThe
    Game Changer\r\n\r\n619.xxx-xxxx\r\nname-at-gmail.com\r\n\r\nThis makes Christine's
    name smaller, but will look nicer, in my opinion. Be sure to leave a little white
    space below the email address and on the left side (it's right aligned) to make
    it stand out. There may be other solutions, but that's mine. Keep the things that
    go together, together.\r\n\r\nThen move \"Professional Experience to the top of
    the page and keep on trucking with the column straight left aligned.\r\n\r\nOther
    comments:\r\n\r\nLike Bendy, I noticed the present tense for the present jobs
    and past tense for past jobs. Is this standard in resumes? I don't know.\r\n\r\n\"send
    invites to become new members\" Do you want to say invites or invitations? \r\n\r\n\"for
    recruiter send-out\"  This sounds jargony to me. I would say \"for recruiters
    to send out\"\r\n\r\n\"up-sold\" This sounds jargony to me. I would say \"Sold
    additional gaming accessories and offered suggestions to customers\"\r\n\r\n\"Promote
    events online\" This needs some jargon: Facebook or blog or google ads. Put some
    tech specs in here.\r\n\r\n\"and directly with a grassroots approach\" Wow! sounds
    great, how about a few more words for details\r\n\r\n\"Responsible for managing
    social media networks\" Just go ahead and drop a few tech names here.\r\n\r\n\"Photographed
    events\" For?? Were they ever used anywhere?\r\n"

  body: "- Not sure why the contact info is hidden below the drawing\r\n\r\n- Maybe
    try to knock out the background of the drawing so it is fully white\r\n\r\n- Shouldn't
    a resume, especially of someone fairly young, be limited to a page?  This is typically
    done to keep it limited to the most important elements.  My opinion is that you
    have a lot of extra info that you are asking me to mentally edit, which is a burden
    to the reader.\r\n\r\n- Unless it is for an illustration position, I am not sure
    the drawing is a good thing to include.\r\n\r\n- I wouldn't indent the text for
    each entry.  The bold headings are enough to separate the sections, or you could
    add a bit of vertical space."

  body: "I feel that the highly stylized photo is too much. Even for a video game
    company. There could be some benefit if they are looking to hire for her looks
    but other than that, it doesn't say enthusiastic individual. \r\n\r\nThen again,
    it does look like she helps with promotions where her looks can be quite valuable
    for all those lovely pimply gamers... ;)\r\n\r\nIf there is time, I'd recommend
    jumping onto a few Forums of actual video games and see if you can get some feedback
    from the company themselves. The only one that I have experience with is League
    of Legends. The employee's are on the forums all the time, so give that a shot.\r\nIf
    you want to give a bit of character to this, maybe you can give her head and glasses
    some sort of cool treatment. Illustrate it in a fun manner or in a funky photo/filtered
    way. The entire body shot just isn't recommended in my opinion. But who knows?
    Maybe send it in, wait a few weeks, send in a little toned down one...?\r\n\r\nOther
    thoughts:\r\n\r\nInstead of blowing out her name, what about a statement? \"I
    PLAY GAMES, TOO!\" \u2014Christine Hoang. Or adding her PSN XBOX Live name. Companies
    in the video game industry want to see players applying."
