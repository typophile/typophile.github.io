  body: There are dozens of typefaces meant to solve some sort of printing or identity
    issue. Meta and Whitney are both great faces that addressed identity needs; Retina
    and Times New Roman address different aspects of printing on newsprint. Reading
    through the descriptions of fonts on the manufacturer web sites will turn up all
    kinds of stuff like this.

  body: "There was a series of typefaces designed by Mergenthaler Linotype, ca. 1926&#150;41,
    to address specific constraints and issues with newspaper printing -- paper issues,
    ink issues, press speed issues, dry stereotype matrix issues, etc. These were
    collectively called the \"Legibility Group.\" They were Ionic No. 5, Excelsior,
    Opticon, Paragon, and Corona.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: As long as self-promotion is allowed, I'll throw my <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>
    into the ring. It was designed explicitly for code listings in print, and it is
    being used for that (most recently in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/the-lift-book">liftbook</a>),
    but a lot more people seem to be using it for their onscreen terminal display
    anyway.

  body: "<em>... more detail would be nice...</em>\r\n\r\nIn that case, you could
    perhaps be more specific about what kind of problems, because it is the nature
    of design to solve problems.\r\n\r\nIn saying that all my faces solve problems,
    I should admit that mostly they are problems I've created, such as \"What would
    a slab serif  designed by Bodoni look like?\" Most type designs could be described
    like that, e.g. \"What would my version of a squarish sans serif look like?\"\r\n\r\nAs
    I understand it, Erik Spiekermann's take on this is that types developed for use
    in specific projects have an inherent virtue.\r\nSo those would concern problems
    a client has created, such as, \"What kind of face would work best in this particular
    corporate branding, for its particular media uses?\" \r\n\r\nDifferent from both
    these are types which address problems of reproduction in specific media (e.g.
    Verdana) or problems of legibility in specific media (e.g. Clearview), or problems
    of readability with specific categories of reader (e.g. Century Schoolbook)."

  body: 'I suppose it might be useful to note that the alternative to this would be
    to design somewhat randomly and let time and users sort out which faces are the
    fittest for whatever purposes fonts are used. This may well happen at the character
    or glyph level, even as languages evolve. However, for something as complex as
    a finished typeface I would think that most of what is regularly used for setting
    type was designed by someone for some specific purpose. '

  body: I am attempting to research whether typefaces are designed randomly, designed
    for a specific purpose, or are simply updated redesigns of older out of date typefaces.
    This is why I initially started this topic. So to answer Nick, I am researching
    this outside of Typophile as well. I simply want some opinions from type designers
    who are involved with this daily. Design doesn't always solve problems. Sometimes
    it creates them ;)

    The Century Magazine, designed by father, then son Bentons, as being an incredible
    fall back collection for me. They were developed to work well with the magazine,
    tall x-height (appears larger on page), designed to fit space well, and as a result
    using up less paper in printing. \r\n\r\nCentury Old Style (and derivatives) are
    my 'copyfitting' standby whenever space is limited and copy is rich! \r\n\r\nVery
    usable problem solver. "

  body: "Fant\xF4mas, \r\n\r\nI share your fascination with \"purpose-driven\" typefaces,
    designs like Bell Centennial, Georgia, Clearview etc. While Nick is right about
    all typefaces (and indeed all design work) solving some problem, I think you mean
    something a bit more specific, mainly dealing with physical/real-world constraints.
    I think his breakdown of these types of problems (reproduction in specific media,
    legibility in specific media etc) is a useful way to look at this stuff. \r\n\r\nFor
    a while I was working on a typeface meant for E-Ink screens, similar to how Georgia
    and Verdana were designed for monitors. Turns out there are E-Ink screens with
    good enough resolution that there wasn't really a need for the typeface, so I
    abandoned the project pretty early on. \r\n\r\nSomething I've done which addresses
    reproduction in specific media was a [[http://exfishgeekgraf.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/first-test/|stencil
    typeface for easy cutting by hand]]. Most common stencil faces were designed to
    be produced by machines, and are very hard to cut by hand with a hobby knife.
    Gerard Unger gets close to a solution with [[http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns13.html|Decoder]].
    Lots of folks in the street art community use computers for designing their stencils,
    thouhg most don't have access to laser cutters. I've recently resumed work on
    this project, which was started at a time when I knew very little about letterforms
    and type design, and the results are na\xEFve in many ways.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking,
    what's been said here about \"all of the above\" seems to make sense, that there
    are many reasons that typefaces get made. I've been doing thesis research on type
    revivals and there are many different motivations that go into reviving a face.
    Could be a client wants it, could be your own fascination with a historical form,
    could be for academic purposes...the list goes on.\r\n\r\n\u2014Noam"
