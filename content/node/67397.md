  body: "Hi Jason,\r\n\r\nI think this is custom. It might have started with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/n/helvetica_ultra_light/?&sample_text=Yay%2C%20I%20do&sample_size=96&update=0\">Helvetica
    Ultralight</a> (see the \u2018a\u2019). Here are a few <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/extra_light_slab_serifs/?&sample_text=Yay%2C%20I%20do&sample_size=96&update=0\">Extra
    Light Slab Serifs</a>.\r\nF"
