body: "I'm working with an architecture firm on a restoration project of an old B&O
  railroad shed. There is a series of numbers painted on brick to indicate the different
  tracks. As part of the restoration process, we want to repaint the numbers in a
  typeface as close to the original as possible. I'm aware that the typeface, being
  from the 1800's, might not be digitized, but I'm sure there is something that comes
  very close. \r\n\r\nI've attached photos of the numbers. Let me know if you would
  like a hi-res version of any of them. \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your help!"

  body: Paint over the photo numbers with black in PhotoShop - select the outline
    of number form with the magic wand tool - make selection into a path - make points
    and move to Illustrator - make full size template, stencil, etc. You now have
    a guide to restore rather than to replace the numbers. Or you could make a font
    from the outline points in Fontographer, FontLab etc.
