body: As part of my dissertation hand-in, I want to include a picture of some Mrs
  Eaves Italic Ligatures. fi, gi and gy. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t own the font so I&#39;m
  asking if it&#39;s possible for somebody to send me a high-res image of these to
  include in my document. I know maybe it&#39;s not allowed, but it&#39;s all non-profit
  educational purposes, and it would save me buying it for three ligatures. <BR> <BR>While
  looking for an image to include, i came across this, <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~maxb/erotype.html"
  target="_blank">The Erotics of Type</a> which is quite interesting.. and <a href="http://www.fontfabrik.com/Porno_Q.html"
  target="_blank">this</a> is very funny.

  body: Have you considered requesting this from Emigre directly? <BR> <BR>If it is
    for educational purposes, I&#39;m sure they would be willing to send you vector
    files of the glyphs you seek. &#40;At least I &#42;hope&#42; they would&#41; <BR>

  body: It&#39;s not illegal for somebody -who owns the font- to provide you with
    not only bitmaps but even EPS outlines - which however doesn&#39;t mean Emigre
    themselves will bend over backwards to provide such to you. <BR> <BR>BTW, MvB
    also has some font porn stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
