  correct path directions? <BR> <BR>More specifically, let&#39;s say I duplicate part
  of a glyph and flip it horizontally. I now want to place the two pieces together,
  but when they overlap, they cut one another out. In Fontographer, you&#39;d just
  select the whole &#34;negative&#34; area and reverse the paths to get it to work
  -- but doing that in Fontlab doesn&#39;t do anything at all. <BR> <BR>What am I
  doing wrong? <BR> <BR>TIA, <BR>Maury'

  body: 'there are three actions wich reverse contours somehow <BR> <BR>one is: tools
    -&#62; operations -&#62; reverse contours another is: tools -&#62; outline -&#62;
    reverse all contours wich both reverse ALL the contours in the glyph and just
    reverse your problem :| <BR> <BR>the this should be the one you need: don&#39;t
    select a contour in your glyph, just right-click on one of the nodes of the outline
    you want to revert and choose &#62;revert contour&#60; you see, the missing of
    the magic little s in the end does the job ;&#41;'

  body: Ute, Maury,  <BR> <BR>to correct path directions in one or more glyphs automatically,
    choose Tools / Transform / Contour / Reverse all [N], then choose &#34;Set counterclockwise
    &#40;Type 1&#41; direction&#34; if you&#39;re making a font with PostScript outlines
    &#40;Type 1, OT PS&#41; or &#34;Set clockwise &#40;TrueType&#41; direction&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>This operation will automatically correct path direction, not just reverse
    it. If the automatic correction has not produced the results you desire, you can
    manually reverse single contours by right-clicking &#40;or Cmd-clicking&#41; on
    a node and choosing using Reverse Contour.   <BR> <BR>In FontLab Studio 5, the
    operation to correct contour direction automatically will be more readily available.  <BR>
    <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam
