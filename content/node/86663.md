  Maybe the letterforms have been edited. This is from prior to 1980. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Etheridge-logo_5634.jpg]"

  body: "Prior to 1980, it could be foundry type, Linotype (or similar linecasting
    type), Varityper/Selectric Composer type or phototype, so an exact match may not
    be possible. Just saying\u2026"

  body: Yeah, the sample of Linotype's Bodoni Book in my copy of Rookledge's typefinder
    looks pretty close to that, especially with that slight upward slope at the top
    of the 't' stem.

    the smaller optical sizes of ITC Bodoni, but I haven't used them myself.

  body: Great, thanks for the information everyone. I thought some of the unique qualities
    may have been a result of the process, but wasn't really sure. It's enough to
    keep me from digging around for some obscure version/alternative to Bodoni.
