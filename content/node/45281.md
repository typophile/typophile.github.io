  be closer to the cap than the others, unless the drop cap constitutes a single letter
  word. Is there a way to do this in InDesign CS3? In the early nineties, in my student
  newspaper in Bergen, Norway, we used to do this in Quark 3.x by inserting two spaces
  between the drop cap and the next letter, and then kerning between the spaces. I\u2019ve
  tried this in InDesign, but I can\u2019t seem to make it work. Anyone?"

  body: "Apparently, InDesign tries to outsmart you when you insert two (or more)
    spaces directly after the cap. If you zoom in on the drop cap, with Hidden Characters
    on, you can see the spaces are discarded by the drop cap.\r\n\r\nHowever ... if
    you insert something <em>else</em> than a space, your old trick works just fine.
    Insert a Hair Space -- that's the smallest one -- and you can kern the first line
    as much to the left as you want.\r\n\r\nAlthough it does the trick, ID has a minimal
    amount of space between the 'cap and the text. It works much better if you set
    the amount of drop characters to \"2\", insert a small space (hairy, thin, or
    whatever looks best for the <em>second line only</em>), and right after that another
    hair space, where you can adjust the position of the <em>first line only</em>."

  body: "Brilliant, thanks! Hair turned out to be the right choice for the drop cap
    space following directly after the initial. For a three story A, I had to add
    another hair space (for a total of three) on the first line, kerning by the minimum
    value of \u20131000 between the 2nd and 3rd hair space and by \u2013600 between
    the last hair space and the text. It looks right to me, thanks again!"

    one more reason I put a zero-width space in my fonts. I believe it is U + 200B.
    This is also handy for kerning drop caps back in the margin, when you want optical
    alignment on the left edge of the characters."
