  body: "Like most professional logos, this is a bespoke design.\r\n\r\nFor the large
    D and F, WhatTheFont tries hard and comes up with \"Hera Big ExtraLight\" by Lucas
    Sharp - which is a pretty good match except for the serifs.  The logo's serifs
    are thin slabs, where Hera's have curved brackets.\r\n\r\nThe sans text could
    be any of many. WTF selects Garage Fonts' \"District Book\" which is sort of close.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    the posted image is heavily watermarked! The only way to get What The Font to
    do anything at all was to first do a screen capture.\r\n\r\n  - Herb"
