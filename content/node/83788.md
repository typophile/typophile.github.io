body: "Hi everyone... I have been having some trouble identifying the fonts on this
  retro Yankees ticket stub. Most of the black text is Alternate Gothic No. 2 (my
  best guess, correct me if I am wrong). However, I can't seem to find a good match
  for the red text (\"58\", \"AUG. 9\", and \"1955\"). I think \"TUESDAY\" is Alt
  Gothic No. 2 as well... but again I could be wrong. I would really appreciate some
  help figuring out what font is being used.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDarryl "

    alone to be sold in separate fonts under the category of "advertising Figures."
    the 58 may well be one of those...
