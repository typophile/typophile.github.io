body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI really need to invest in a color printer for proof work in
  my graphic design/illustration/type/logo design workflow. I'd like to be able to
  print out a half accurate proof for any client work to give to them. \r\n\r\nAbout
  5 years ago I had a $1000 Epson A3 Photo injet printer (can't remember the series
  number) but it was a real hassel to get it to print correctly and the ink very quickly
  dried and my overal experience was very frustrating and disappointing and stopped
  using the thing as a result.\r\n\r\nSo I was looking at an A4 color laser. I have
  a black toner Hp1200 laserjet for about 9 years and it has just been terrific. Just
  wondering if anyone can recommend me a good A4 color laser for my situation and
  any specifics I should be looking out for.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I could trust Epson
  again after that experience although I'm sure their other products are much better.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great"

    take pictures from the printed letter 'a' with the help of a microscope:\r\nhttp://www.druckerchannel.de/cache_bilder/std/und_beim_normaldruck_keine_veraenderung_im_treiber_ldafe0.jpg\r\n\r\nIt
    may sound theoretically, but there are big differences with regard to the precision
    and thickness, in which laser printers print letters. HP seems to print too thin,
    at least the monochrome printers.\r\n\r\nYou also should care about duplex precision
    and the document authenticity of the toner. For example it can happen, that the
    toner gets off, if you fold the paper, although it is resistant against finger
    nails and wetness.\r\n\r\nI have heard, that the toner, that Lexmark uses, is
    document authentic. Samsung is not. But Lexmark tends to print thicker than Samsung,
    at least, if you compare the monochrome printers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately they never
    tested a Xante printer.\r\n\r\nI would like to know more of those sources."

  body: "I bought a Xerox Phaser 6130 a year ago and the quality is very good. As
    I recall, it worked 'out of the box'. The setup switch, which I found to be fiddly,
    is similar to the multi-position switches on mobile phones and cameras, so if
    you're familiar with those, you'll have no problem. I've not had to replace one
    of the 4 cartridges, but I'm a light (home) user. \r\n\r\nAs to whether it's the
    'best' or not, I can't say, but it does reproduce text, drawn vector shapes and
    solid fills extremely well and photographs look pretty good. The problem is that
    one person's 'excellent', is another person's 'average'. I've used standard laser/copier
    paper and photographic. The output is very good on both, but it's noticeably  better
    on the photographic paper. I've had a couple of inkjets and in every respect the
    Xerox is much better. It was reasonably priced, too."

  body: Hi Ian, thanks for the input can the Phaser 6130 do edge to edge A4 (borderless)?
    and what is the thickest stock you have used in it?

  body: "As far as I know, there\u2019s always a border. You can specify no margin
    in Page Setup, but prints have a 3mm gap all round. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve printed
    on 120gsm Matt Picture paper. The manual lists various papers including Thick
    Card stock up to 220gsm, but it wouldn\u2019t accept 180gsm Photo Gloss Inkjet
    paper. The printer is very particular about paper types; you have to specify the
    correct paper type in the printer\u2019s menu. I\u2019ll investigate."
