body: "In the 1960s I was marking up copy as a type specifier in an advertising typography
  house in LA when they closed shop. One of the items I was able to take with me was
  a 1923 ATF specimen book that I'm now offering for sale on ebay:\r\n\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=271592263221&ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:US:1123\r\n\r\nIt
  has been well used and shows some signs of wear, but it is in excellent condition
  considering its age. \r\n\r\nThis is an invaluable reference volume for any serious
  digital age designer.\r\n\r\nI've placed quite a few images of various pages of
  the book on my ebay listing, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDC\r\n\r\n"

  body: I might be able to go up in the attic and find some type specimen books from
    the 60s & 70s from type houses I've worked at.  They would be the type used by
    in-house specifiers to mark up copy that ad agencies would submit for ad repro
    proofs. Most would include some handset, Ludlow, Linotype, and Monotype line samples.
    Is that what you had in mind?

  body: I'll see if I have some time next week to dig around upstairs. I also remember
    saving a few of a monthly newsletter type booklet put out by a Chicago advertising
    typographers association. They contained some interesting articles this group
    might find of interest.
