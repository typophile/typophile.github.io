  came fairly close but there are obvious differences like 'A' and 'P'. Also it looks
  fairly different in lower case.\r\nUnfortunately what I have is a very limited sample.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any idea?\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample.gif]\r\n\r\njayrom"

    are often used for navigation buttons. In other words, this may not be a 'normal'
    font that you could print, because bitmap fonts only look good at low screen resolutions.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Mike, I highly doubt this is a bitmap font as there is evident anti-aliasing
    which would not normally occur in the use of bitmap fonts.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\nI do not think it is a bitmap font. This is an
    actual image that was created by a designer who has since disappeared without
    bothering to let me know which font she used!\r\nI looked at FF DIN but it seems
    to me the 'H' and 'E' are fairly different, with the middle stem(?) being a lot
    lower in the font I posted.\r\nThis characteristic is what made me first believe
    that it was Neutraface.\r\n\r\njayrom"

    the pixel size. Quite often the horizontal stems \"jump\" up or down a pixel when
    anti-aliasing. I'm positive this is DIN."
