  body: This was done by hand for sure, look at the E&#39;s, they are all different.
    You could use <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=401440" target="_blank">Boxspring</a>
    for a similar look. <BR> <BR>I suggest you take out a scissor and some construction
    paper. Or, use Illustrator.

  body: There are so many fonts right now that try to look like they were done by
    hand it&#39;s not always so easy to tell. It&#39;s fun to do a handjob &#40;he
    he&#41; if it&#39;s a logo or just a few words but a real pain if you need a lot
    of text.

    look for the simplest solution, like you suggested, cut paper. How about drawing.
    The word I like to use is KISS: Keep it simple smartie'
