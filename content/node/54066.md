body: Hey typo addicts! I would just like to know what is the font printed in Sugababe's
  album "ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES." I think it's a pretty simple and common font (but
  I just love it so much), it's so retro or something. I hope someone could help me
  out! Thanks a million!    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Angelwithnofaces_5921.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Angelswithdirtyfaces_5137.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dontchafreaklikme_4211.jpg]

  body: "This fontyukle-site is verrrrrrrrry suspicous, it offers many commercial
    fonts for free, illegally as it seems. \r\n\r\nKenneth: Asking for a free font
    when it comes to commercial fonts is like asking for a free download for the latest
    music-album. Illegal. You don\u2019t do that, do you? Most of the people here
    are living by designing beautiful things, many of them by designing typefaces.
    It is like a slap in their face if the people come here and asking for free downloads
    for their hard work. Respect them please. "

    illegal.\r\n\r\nWith fonts, like music, there are great freebies to be had here
    and there, but most of it is work created by people earning a living by creating
    and selling the work. "
