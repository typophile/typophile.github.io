  one.\r\n\r\nhere's the description again:\r\nMAQ is a company that is going to start
  giving out certificates for nurses and other people in the medical field. The certificate
  is for treatment/handling of prescription drugs, dosage and things like that for
  patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nyes yes, trying a more modern approach this time. A bowl, which
  references to the Bowl of Hygeia, used by other medicine organizations.\r\n\r\nLeafs
  witch symbolizes growth.\r\n\r\nThe top one is the newest version.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback
  greatly appreciated.\r\npeter\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maq_logo_v7_comp_4235.jpg]"

  body: "Oh yeah, looking good, looking 'important'. For me it's definitely number
    one, the other ones look blobby because they don't have enough air through the
    devices and also the shapes, although meaningful, seem not to balance compositionally.
    Although I do like the stripes.\r\n\r\nI wonder though whether number one could
    go even simpler? The triangle of the bowl perhaps dominates too much (also makes
    t a bit top heavy) and takes away from the nice balance the leaves and the text
    have between light and dark. Perhaps it's worth exploring just the leaves or the
    bowl or something. Loving the colours,  *makes mental note to use oranges and
    purples together in the future*\r\nAgain, though, looking good."

  body: "01\r\nThe leafs look like flames in the top two ones. Number three looks
    like a leaf.\r\n\r\n02\r\nRemember to test the design in b/w also\r\n\r\n03\r\nI
    like the first design (the top one) best\r\n\r\n04\r\nBowl ... what bowl? Is the
    blue triangle a bowl? Then what is the brown shape on top of it? The inside of
    the bowl seen in perspective? Or some kind of stylized content?\r\nAnd what is
    the brown upside-down triangular shape between the leafs?\r\n... I would say that
    the bowl is more abstract than the leafs/flames if you get my drift ... I think
    they should have the same amount likeness/should be drawn in the same style\r\n\r\n05\r\nOverall:
    nice, clean, professional, trustworthy, nice colours\r\n\r\n06\r\nThis version
    is two-storey ... you may consider a one-storey version ... (symbol left and typography
    right) ... I mean, you may need both ..."

  body: "I like the stripes too, I've been trying to incorporeate them in to the first
    one but no good results yet.\r\n\r\nI've been testing this idea to have the leafs
    connected at the botton and have the bowl \"grow\" out of them, would be a nice
    suitable concept but I think I need to draw a diffretn bowl for that to work,
    keeping it one color and then I would get rid of the traingle top bit beeing to
    heavey. Have to work more on that version though.\r\n\r\nYeah I've noticed that
    the leaves aren't precived as leaves. Some other people have pointed that out
    also.\r\n\r\nYes the orange top is supposed to symbolize conten, so you would
    have a full bowl. The hole two triangel thing is supposed to show diversity by
    having the bowl split in two colors, same as two color leaves.\r\n\r\nI'm also
    have a version that is one storey because they are considering using an additional
    text with the name, something like \"Competent Drugcare\" or something like tahat
    but I can't post that version here since the real name is still secret.\r\n\r\nThe
    MAQ version of the logo will not be used with this text so that's why it's two
    storey. The MAQ version will probably be in use for a few months until they decide
    what the project is to become, a company or some kind of non-profit association.
    The final name depends on this aswell.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks will post updates in
    a couple of days.\r\npeter"

  body: "I like number 2 best as the leaves look most like leaves, as they do not
    rise as sharply.\r\nThe 'Q' I am not too fond of. I would use a Q with a bar that
    runs in a squiggle horizontally through the bowl of the 'Q'\r\n\r\nNice work."

  body: "I'd correct the \"spikes\" within the blue part and make them less pointed
    by putting the node apart into two nodes. It will also help with printing process.
    Or cut vinyl.\r\n\r\nThe outer curve seems symmetric but the top of the symbol
    doesn't suggest that.\r\n\r\nMaybe make the gap between both parts smaller?\r\n\r\nJust
    suggestions to try out. Otherwise I like it a lot."
