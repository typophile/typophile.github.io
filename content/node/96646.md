body: "So I'm starting on my first serious Hebrew companion to a font in the works.
  I'm far from professional or even good, I'd say. Either way, I found that resources
  about Hebrew text are very rare, and while I could fine plenty of resources about
  latin character design, I find myself doing mostly guesswork when it comes to Hebrew.\r\n\r\nSo
  I managed to figure out a lot of things by myself just from looking at how existing
  known fonts look: shin connects to the left side, samech is kind of like a lowercase
  sigma as opposed to final mem, and so forth. But still, I know virtually nothing
  besides.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that (naturally) Hebrew letters are constructed
  somewhat differently from latin characters. I have a hard time really finding which
  components I should match up. There are certain things between different latin characters
  which are kept roughly the same throughout most characters (serifs, stems, etc)
  but I don't really know which ones I should match, really.\r\n\r\nIf you have any
  useful tips, tricks, resources and such about this subject, I'd love to know.\r\n\r\nAlso
  a more specific question now. Should my final nun reach all the way down to the
  same descender as the latin characters in the font? If so, wouldn't that be far
  too long? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAdi"

  body: "I'm not an expert on Hebrew (I've only done highly imitative designs in that
    script) so hopefully you'll get some good replies from people with more specific
    experience, but from my long experience designing non-Latin type in general I
    will state one thing, and quite strongly: make sure you don't bend the Hebrew
    to the will of the Latin. Too many people who make non-Latin type value formal
    harmony between shapes so highly that they ignore what a script truly needs to
    function well. For example, serifs: don't do what Eric Gill did!\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lerfu/gill-hebrew/\r\n\r\nI
    once wrote an article about this topic titled \"Latinization: Prevent and Cure\"
    - maybe you can find a copy of Spatium magazine (issue #4) or the Greek journal
    Hyphen (#5) where it was featured.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Adi,\r\n\r\nI have written a little on how I designed companion Latin fonts
    for my Hebrew Font Shuneet see \"Matching Hebrew and Latin\" on 15 Oct 2010.  I
    would stress that in no way do the two fonts look alike!  They are companions
    - they go together and coexist comfortably when displayed or printed on the same
    page. On my website [[ http://hebrew-font-shuneet.com ]] you will see many examples
    of Hebrew and English side-by-side.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the Introduction on
    my web site you will see that I have spent about forty years at this activity.
    \ I began with calligraphy and did not imagine that would lead to font design.\r\n\r\nYour
    intention is to design a Hebrew font. I don't know what level of knowledge you
    have concerning the language ...but I can't imagine that a person who doesn't
    know some Hebrew could do this.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is this. Find an existing
    Hebrew font that you can add to your own font and import the characters. You will
    need to find a font with a suitable license. I did this for my Hebrew font by
    importing the Latin characters of Tuffy.  \r\n\r\nClearly Tuffy doesn't look like
    a Hebrew font in any way. I did not change my imported Tuffy to \"look Hebrew\"
    however I did change it to have some of the characteristics of the Hebrew Font
    Shuneet, for instance I modified it so that the stroke width was more constant,
    also I changed the stroke terminators to match, and so on...\r\n\r\nYou can copy
    the example texts from my web site, change the English to your font then look
    around for a free Hebrew font that will make a tolerable companion.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, Mike\r\n"

  body: "The Hebrew fonts that come with Ubuntu (a version of Unix) have a license
    that might give you what you want.  I believe this is available in Israel.\r\n\r\nSome
    licenses,  for instance the one I use for the Hebrew Font Shuneet are for \"free\"
    fonts where \"free\" is to be interpreted as in 'free speech' rather than 'free
    beer'(!)\r\n\r\nWhen you use font A as a source for another font B, the license
    of the new font B may not be more restrictive than the original license of A,
    which means that the license of font B must also be free (or even more free).\r\n\r\nMike"

    be, but even that level of success may not always be achieved. Thus, the Unicode
    font \"Caslon Roman\" resembles the kind of Roman letters often found with Chinese
    or Japanese DBCS fonts, and I think they are failures... a non-native may not
    know <em>what to look for</em> when attempting to imitate precedent."
