		<div class="commentbody">Smashing Pumpkins, I like the analogy. &#40;Ofcourse, it&#39;s even worse in the UK because it doesn&#39;t conjure an image of teenage Halloween vandalism but one of a genteel village fete gardening competition: &#34;Those pumpkins are smashing Mr. Williams...&#34;&#41;. Maybe someone should post an image of a pumpkin lantern with the aiwa mouth, just to fold everything together again. <BR> <BR>Seriously though... <BR> <BR>BJ. How can you assess whether the logo is poorly drawn if you don&#39;t know the intention behind the drawing? Are you implying that the designer didn&#39;t realise that the second &#34;a&#34; was heavier than the first one? The supposedly problematic features of the logo to my mind lend intrigue and, I&#39;ll say it again, vibrancy to the design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That&#39;s brilliant. The &#34;Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond&#34; thing is amazingly bad. Is this a well-known chain in the US? And where did they get their stupid name? Is there some kind of natural progression from bed to bath to beyond &#40;whatever that means&#41;? <BR> <BR>Yes you&#39;re right it&#39;s horrible. But do you know this one: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/20462.gif" alt="Cleanaway logo"> <BR> <BR>Again it&#39;s not the greatest logo in the world but neither is it as risible as your example. In other words the implementation is &#40;relatively&#41; poised and subtle. <BR> <BR>The new aiwa logo is at least another level removed in that it has moved into abstraction and is allowed to generate its own logic. Would we be justified in saying the logo becomes louder or more intense? The effect reminds me of Picasso&#39;s late drawings where you follow the line of a figure and suddenly a shoulder pops or a muscle flexes as you try to make sense of the whole. I don&#39;t want to flog a patch of ground where there was once a dead horse so I won&#39;t go on... <BR> <BR>Do I think the designer&#39;s intention matters here? Yes because it &#39;s easy to rush to judgements based on our preconceptions but it isn&#39;t at all desirable. A useful critique will always attempt to meet the object on open &#40;or deterritorialized&#41; ground. <BR> <BR>Do I love the new aiwa logo? No, but I think it&#39;s a lot more interesting than most people here are prepared to admit. If this forum is meant to present a new logo every now and again so that everyone can take the piss then fair enough. Let me know and I won&#39;t bother anyone with further posts.</div>

It would be young hip and I bet better. How do you know if something is good or bad? Try eating dry Turkey or burnt peas, no one has to tell you its bad.

		<div class="commentbody">Simon, the difference of opinion is refreshing. I&#39;m glad someone else sees it differently. I would hate for this place to become static itself, where everybody agrees out of fear or with the hopes of fitting in. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s easy for designers to get that &#34;not created here syndrome&#34; where nothing they didn&#39;t design themselves is cool. I&#39;m always trying to question myself that way; to look at something with fresh eyes. <BR> <BR>That said, bad design ought to be pointed out and learned from. The opposite of &#34;not created here syndrom&#34; is the &#34;emperor&#39;s new clothes syndrom,&#34; where the thing must be good since so-and-so did it or since it uses such-and-such technique.</div>
