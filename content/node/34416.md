  the \"ford typeface\" available for free on various font sites. Besides it's really
  badly drawn :(\r\n\r\nSo that being said does anyone know if this typeface exists
  or of a suitable substitute for this beautifully drawn script.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPhil\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ford_at_fifty_sm_6639.jpg]"

  body: You can tell this is hand drawn (not a typeface) by comparing the 'F's. <a

    is as close as you'll get with a font, but beware their DRM scheme.

      Guess i'm gonna have to keep trying to find something closer. This one's hard."
