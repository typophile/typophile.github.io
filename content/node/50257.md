  body: "It was handlettered back in the day, but at some point the Red Sox and Major
    League Baseball apparently commissioned a font from Dennis Ortiz-Lopez.\r\n\r\nhttp://ortiz-lopez.com/OLP06.html\r\n\r\nIt's
    listed in his \"Proprietary Fonts\" section. I'd say there's almost no chance
    it's available to someone not affiliated with the team or MLB."
