  fonts to suit my needs but haven't actually made a working font yet.\r\n\r\nI need
  a little advice just whether people like the unicase style, whether its been done
  before and which Q.\r\n\r\nI attend on making a heavier version and a compressed
  version, maybe the compressed version could be a lowercase option, we'll see.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    D and P arent working. Maybe you should try to make them with ascender and descender!?
    U and N are way too wide. The R and S arent nice. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteven"

  body: "D and P are indeed not really working, imo. The opening in the C is v\xE9ry
    small. The N and U are too wide I think. The J somehow seems to miss a horizontal
    (slab)serif on the left side. The S isn't working.\r\nThe numerals are weird,
    but somehow nice as well. Only the 6 and the 9 maybe not very legible."

  body: "I really like this -- you should definitely keep developing this. I agree
    with all that Steven and Jelmar said, except that I dont' dislike the r. \r\n\r\nSome
    suggestions of my own: There's something weird going on with the M's strokes --
    the left middle one seems to oddly taper in the center, which definitely ruins
    the monoline feel of the letter. I find the left Q too illegible, but maybe you
    could add a serif or two to the right Q to make it a bit more different in keeping
    with the rest of the font. I feel the X is too wide, while the Z isn't wide enough.
    The Y feels unbalanced -- try moving the top two strokes higher. I'd rethink the
    1, 9, 6, and 7. The 6 and 7 especially look too much like other letters (b and
    F). Finally, I'd shrink the top of the 2.\r\n\r\nAgain, I really like where you're
    going with this."

    the changes people have suggested and its looking a lot better. I'll just keeping
    working on it and maybe post it again once I'm happy with the changes.\r\n\r\nThanks
