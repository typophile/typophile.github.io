body: "Hi there. I'm new here, I'm from Brazil and, as the business card I attached
  says (in portuguese), I'm a psychologist. I just graduated and I decided to print
  my business cards in letterpress, but my budget is pretty tight, so I have to design
  them myself. Now I don't expect anybody to work for free, but since I have barely
  any experience at all with design I thought maybe you guys could take a look and
  tell me if I'm making any gross mistakes, maybe point me in the right direction.
  The same goes for the logo itself, the little couch, I designed it myself and it's
  my first attempt at something of the sort. Any help would be really appreciated.\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sofa3_5041.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you very much for the suggestions.\r\nI thought of printing it in portrait
    instead of landscape, but I think it looks sort of too modern. I'm young and my
    clients will mostly be younger people, so that's not my main concern, but I want
    the card to look relatively professional and the little armchair already looks
    a little too childish for my taste (but I can't manage to make it look any better),
    so I thought having the card in landscape orientation would get a more classic
    feel.\r\nHere's an attempt at a portrait version:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3vertical_6230.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    the same goes for the weight of my name, when I use a heavier type the card seems
    even more childish to me, and using a serif typeface seems a little off next to
    the armchair. What I tried here (on the portrait version and the one below) is
    to have the numbers in a lighter weight instead, maybe it could achieve the same
    result you're suggesting and reinforce the hierarchy. What do you think? And do
    you like the portrait version better considering what I said?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3lighter_4533.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
    other tips, anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nDaniel\r\n"

  body: "imho, it looks gorgeous, and I think you have avoided making the armchair
    looking even remotely \"childish\". My first impression at the chair was more
    \"mature and classy\" in fact (looks like a great chair for a good book and a
    glass of Scotch).\r\n\r\nThe only nitpicking I have right now is the contrast
    between the numbers and the email-adress. I think bold/regular is enough to contrast
    the lines, I think the inclusion of the sudden italic breaks the simple flow of
    the card. "

    get through with the armchair.\r\nI guess you're right about the italic. There
    was something telling me that at the back of my head but I was resisting it just
    because I like the variety, but it doesn't fit the card very well.\r\nSo here's
    where we're at, the card without the italic and with the numbers in semibold (instead
    of bold):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3lighterroman_5809.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
    still thinking of keeping the numbers in full bold, though, even more without
    the italic. I'm not sure. And my phone number might actually more important than
    my name. Although I guess everything will already look slightly heavier in letterpress.
    With the numbers in bold and without the italic it looks like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3roman_3903.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    dissuading me of the italic was already a great help. Thank you. And any other
    feedback would be great. I'll post a picture of the card when I make up my mind
    and get it printed. I'm thinking of using a sort of creamy, natural color card
    stock. We'll see."

    move your details a little further down and increase the leading between the entries.
    This would be more improving on the portrait format.\r\n\r\nI would also consider
    another typeface for those details since the bold is overwhelming the e-mail address.\r\n\r\nYou

    try to add some more space like you said.\r\nThanks again!\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Oh, and that six really looks terrible. But it's just the rendering when exporting
    to jpeg I guess. In the pdf it looks good."

  body: "I prefer the original version with the email address in italic. It helps
    break up that block, thus bounce your eye to the more important lines -- your
    name and occupation. Just another opinion... I'd agree the numbers are too bold.
    Is there a semi-bold? And if you lighten the numbers, maybe the email address
    should be not be italic...\r\n\r\nWatch how your eye moves, and where it winds
    up as you make changes.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, space will also have an effect. What
    happens if you stay with the original size & leading, but move the numbers/email
    block down just a point or so? I would try that, too.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've been
    at this 30+ years, and will still trim a test printout to final size before being
    assured I have all the spaces/sizes right. It is so easy to fool yourself.\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\nDon't normally comment on business cards, but I like this. Well done.\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\n\r\nEdit: Should have added that the internal space is most important,
    because they will mis-trim some of the cards. Yes, the \"margin\" space is important,
    just don't get it too critical, so the piece falls apart if it's mis-trimmed by
    a 1/16 inch or so."

    I'm very volatile. :)\r\n\r\nHere's the card with more space, more leading and
    the numbers in semi-bold. Also the armchair is smaller and I made the \"@\" smaller
    in my email address:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3lighterromantracking_4089.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd

    I don't know why, but when I convert the text to outlines (which the guy who will
    print it insists I do) everything looks even lighter, so the semi-bold looks even
    less bold."

  body: "Imho, I would have a go on a portrait card. Since you are young and you have
    young customers I would prefer a more modern approach e.g. The first line: \"Hi,
    I'm Dani\xEBl.\" It would give you a headstart on your introduction and 'forcing'
    the person who get's the card to introduce him/herself too. If not it might let
    the other person smile a bit. In any case, your first name will be remembered
    more easily. \r\n\r\nLike the logo very much, don't change it"

  body: "Yes, I'm still considering the portrait version, I don't know. It's just
    that since my clients and I are already young I don't want to put off the older
    ones. I thought of having something like that, \"Hi, I'm Daniel\", but in portuguese
    it doesn't sound as good. \"Oi, meu nome \xE9 Daniel\". I don't know, it seems
    silly in portuguese. What I thought of doing was to write \"Fale mais sobre isso\"
    on one of the sides of the card, which is something like \"Can you say more about
    that?\"\r\nBut then it would get too expensive to print on both sides of the paper,
    I'd need thicker stock, and I also want to have some space on the card to write
    notes and whatever. And then I couldn't manage to make it look good with all that
    on the same side of the card, it starts getting too crowded, and I want to keep
    it simple. But I'm still thinking about it. It would be great in a situation when,
    for instance, someone it sharing too much about their personal lives with a stranger
    or something like that, they could just hand them my card: \"Can you say more
    about that? Daniel Marques. Psychologist.\"\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/falemais_4815.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    I'm not sure. I like the simplicity of the landscape version. And this looks a
    little top-heavy too, I don't like the composition.\r\n\r\nI've been playing around
    with the landscape version, here's another option:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_6732.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    think the previous one is still my favorite, though. On the one hand I think my
    name in a bigger face would look nice in letterpress, and it has a more of a \"bam!\"
    effect. But on the other hand it sacrifices some of the simplicity too, and it
    looks a little more standard to me. The other version, without so much emphasis
    on my name, seems a little more challenging, in a good way.\r\n\r\nAh, I don't
    know, I don't know! What do you guys think?"

    but I didn't want to mess with it too much. Maybe I'll still set it a bit higher.

  body: The chair is actually quite a bit left of center... when I set it to the exact

    but I might have overdone it. I've been looking at it for too long and I can't
    even tell anymore what looks right and what doesn't, I thought nobody would notice
    it was a little to the left. Thanks for telling me you did! I'll send it back
    to the right a bit.

  body: "Couple quick points -- As you already observed, your business card is for
    business, and your business is not graphic design. The portrait layout stands
    a better chance of getting into a museum, not your goal. Do what's best for business.\r\n\r\nThe
    second is when you moved the bottom block, it was more like centimeters. Way too
    far. A point is 1/72 of an inch, about 0.3 millimeters. And yes, that can matter.\r\n\r\nYou
    don't want either too close to the edge of the card, as I said, trimming won't
    be that exact.\r\n\r\nIn passing -- I guess there is no semi-bold in the fonts
    you're using?"

    a designer piece could be actually a disadvantage for me. I think I'll do that
    and go with the landscape version.\r\nAbout the leading and space between the
    blocks, I know I added more than you said, I just thought it would look better
    like that since I made the chair smaller too. Here's a little less space:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3lighteritalictracking_5521.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
    for the numbers, except on my first post, where they were in bold, the others

    even with the numbers in semi-bold maybe the e-mail address would be better in

    now don't have the money to spare. When I get to that I'll post it here too.\r\n\r\nThank

    to design them all at the same time so you have a nice coordinated system, rather
    than designing them in a rush some evening when you suddenly need them. You can
    just print the letterhead and envelopes on your office printer until you can afford
    professional printing."

    I'll call it fetishism, in the sense of an emotion that is displaced to a physical

    paper goods and writing instruments and all that... I just love those things,
    not even for what they mean or represent, but just the things themselves (hence
    the term fetishism), the smell of the paper, the texture of the ink. You know
    when you buy a new book and the pages are kind of sticking to each other and you
    have to run your finger through the page's edge to separate them? That's almost
    like an orgasm to me. Haha.
