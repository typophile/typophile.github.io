body: "Hey there!\r\n\r\nQuick question. I've searched the web (and this forum) for
  hours now but I just can't find what I'm looking for. \r\nI need the basic formgroups
  blackletter type consists of (the more variations the better). \r\n\r\nNow that
  I think about it, is there a guide out there that breaks up blackletter forms to
  it's very basic elements, does anybody know of some kind of guide?\r\n\r\nI'd be
  happy if someone points at the right keyword to search for. my typographic english
  is basic/intermediate so I wouldn't be surprised if I missed something on google.\r\n\r\nByeBye\r\nD\xF6si\r\n\r\n

    genre, the script equivalent of <em>Gebrochene Schriften</em> \u2013 I suppose
    deliberately, as it never was significant in typography), there\u2019s also the

    Mon Amour</a> \u2013 basically a similar approach, with a finer differentiation
