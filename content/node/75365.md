    the Friday lectures. It\u2019s quite a trek, but I\u2019m combining it with a
    family visit (and vice versa) to justify the trip.\r\n\r\nAnd Si \u2014 I still
    owe you that pint! ;-)"

    opposite direction around that time...\r\n\r\nObviously Thomas Phinney will be
    there.\r\n\r\nWill any of the speakers have their presentations available in another
    form?\r\n\r\nI also lament not be able to see the screening of Making Faces \u2013
    Metal Type in the 21st Century... Alas, I will have to see a non-screening instead."

    early days of Adobe talk - apparently the first lecture he's given on the subject.
    \r\n\r\nMany thanks to Juliet and the team!"
