  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's something I've been thinking about and would love some input on. I'm sure this has been discussed at length before, and I know I'm still in a very early stage of learning, so I'll be equally glad about pointers to older threads, and/or literature.

Looking at <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.02.method.htm">Briem's page on spacing</a>, I noticed he employs the "glass of water" analogy to describe correct spacing ("the same volume of water that filled the counters should also fill the gaps between the letters"), which is also how I was taught letterspacing at design school. 
A different description, which —being more functionally-oriented than merely formalistically descriptive— intuitively seems to make more sense, is this one that I just came across in Peter Enneson's article in TYPO #13 (page 26): "Perceptual distances between letterforms must be great enough to minimize criterial cue confusions or masking. But not be so large that cross-letter binding or constructive conjunction is inhibited." 

So here's the question. Especially compared to definions such as Peter Enneson's quoted above, I'm suspecting the "glass of water" model is overly simplistic &ndash; mainly because of the issue of optical scaling, the need of which I'm not sure it can accommodate. My impression from a typesetting/typography perspective is that the need for a relative expansion of inter-letter space (OK, tracking) is much increased at smaller point sizes. Now I know that optimally, setting text at a smaller size means employing a dedicated optically-sized cut, which (inter alia) increases the relative width and visible counterspace of the lettershapes. But it seems that the <em>inter</em>-letter space needs to be adjusted more for smaller sizes than the <em>intra</em>-letter space usually is &ndash; as in, the adjustments made to intra- and inter-letter space seem not to be linear. 

If this is indeed so, then I'm wondering why. Does the effect of lateral interference increase at smaller sizes? Also, if intra- and inter-letter space do not in fact scale in a linear fashion, how can one talk about glasses of water without factoring in target point size?

Or am I mistaken (and most likely, visually misdirected from working too much with non-optically-sized digital fonts) and in proper optical sizing, the scaling of intra- and inter-letter space actually is parallel/linear, so that the concept of optical scaling does not in fact refute the "glass of water" model?</div>

they have the same area (‘volume of water’), do they 'look' equivalent? Even if you can calculate the volume of intra/interspaces, trying to equalize volumes (numerically) is a very crude approach, I suspect. 
I don’t know much about perception but I think you need to consider other factors, like the 'compactness' of a shape, the absolute dimensions, etc.

Certainly. I sure hope the adherents of the "glass of water" model wouldn't apply the principle mechanically/mathematically (that would be scary), but adjust the space optically &ndash; but still <em>based</em> on the "glass of water" idea. (FWIW, that's what they taught me at school.) 

Still, the metaphor is there and I wonder how much merit it has. How elastic can a glass be (esp regarding the point size question) before it stops being a glass? :->

As a PS, I just remembered a slightly different metaphor used by Jost Hochuli, who talks about the white as light shining into the lettershapes, which allows for slightly finer gradations (like he says light coming from above is stronger, which is why a sans serif "u" needs to be narrower than an "n") but still departs from the idea of equal "light" inside and around the letters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, Yes, generally, larger type needs less interletter spacing. Other things occur along with the visual mass concept (glass of water theory expanded to include perceptual bias). A big factor is proximity of nearest segment--meaning a serif on a cap V being near a Serif on a cap W.  When the two are quite close, the proximity factor begins to overcome part of the visual mass of space issue. It is often impossible to have a space as those between upright adjacent letters like H and N be truly equal to adjacent opposing diagonals like V and Y unless you vastly letterspace. Using the proximity effect minimizes the perceived difference though.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys. Sounds like the "glass of water" model, at the very least, isn't accounting for everything that needs to be considered.

<em>"Yes, generally, larger type needs less interletter spacing."</em>
Thanks for confirming this, Chris. 
I still wonder why, if anyone is up for explaining that. Maybe something to do with there being <em>absolute</em> limits to visibility of interletter space (especially related to the proximity parameter*)?

* Which I can see now is probably included in the concept of "perceptual distance" quoted above (I read "distance" as a linear concept rather than [only] volume-based).</div>

And maybe this stuff is just that &ndash; but I guess I'm wondering if there are any attempts to find out how this funny effect of perception* comes about.

* By the way, I always thought the Doppler effect <em>is</em> an actual effect on pitch of sound, in the way that sound waves emanating from a moving object in the direction of that movement (relative to the observer) are "squooshed", making for a different received frequency &ndash; not just the brain playing tricks?

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, the sound of a car engine at the source is a given pitch and does not change. Sound moving through an air mass with dense atmosphere can alter what hits your ear some distance away but does not truly change the source of the sound (the car engine). Granted, I am making a metaphoric comparison, not a scientific one--so far, none exists. The ratio of letterspace to glyph does not change in reality but it appears to. Since the eye is always the final arbiter, we have to appease then not a measuring device. There may come a day when science has a more measurable reason for the difference and can predict the proper distance of change but it is just easier to make your change visually. Take a font designed for text reading and another for display from the same family and scale them to the same size. You will see the difference but you may not find a ratio of change that suits all families of type.

Of course not <em>at the source</em>, but in this case, in the space between the source and the ear; I'd put that in the realm of physics, not perceptional psychology. Whereas with the issue of spaces between small lettershapes, I wouldn't expect some light rays to physically go astray on the way to the eye &ndash; but rather something strange to happen inside the eye, or the brain? But that's conjecture, and maybe also semantics rather than anything else.

<em>"Since the eye is always the final arbiter, we have to appease then not a measuring device."</em>
Oh that point is totally clear. And I wasn't looking for numbers (how much to adjust it by, or something). I'm just very curious to learn how perception works, maybe overly so. If you say science doesn't know yet, that's an answer.</div>

My sound analogy probably was less helpful than confusing :-)

We actually only anecdotally know that it works--even preferentially if you count legibility studies where "increased letter spacing" seems to be preferred by subjects of studies at reading text sizes. I don't remember the names of the studies any more and am sadly only left with what the perceived conclusion was.  We are all curious to find out more about how perception works. There have been numerous studies but the why and how to part still does not seem clear enough to help a type designer much more than trial amd error. Oh, well, sorry I could not be of much help.

Following, Briem’s page on spacing you always have the type you are employing to guide you. So, if you are composing type, and you want to see what tracking works, and how the glasses of water are equalized, set a line like iiiniii in the face you are spacing, or IIIHIII if caps, (the i's and l's have 'no water inside' and the n or H show you the how the average inside space relates). With tracking you can adjust this text sample so that the space between i's and the counter of the n are even, or as I and many others prefer, with slightly less space outside than in. Then, you can apply this tracking to broader text.

Nina, can you explain what you base this statement on? I'm just interested in understanding your frame of reference. I want to make sure I'm reading you right. You're saying that it seems that for smaller sizes the space inside letters is usually adjusted more than the space between letters. Did I get that right?

Are you thinking about a comparison of text to small text, or are you comparing display to text? (I think these are definitely two different paradigms, so I want to understand which you're talking about.)

And are you looking at/thinking about metal type (which was inherently optically scaled) or current "opticals" like what Adobe and others have done?

		<div class="commentbody">The glass of water thing in Briem is seriously misleading if you take it too seriously. Looking visually equal and actually being equal in area are two different things. I've tested it by measuring inter-letter areas between nn and oo on well-spaced type. They're not mathematically equal, even though they look nicely balanced. 

As well as visual equality of inter-letter space, making the outer space proportional to inner counter space, keeping adjacent parts from visually crowding, keeping a (not exact) regular rhythm of verticals and white, and even adjusting for weight of strokes--left vs right side of M--are all things to consider and weigh. And they are sometimes in conflict with one another. 

I certainly don't claim to know the ideal way to balance all these. Then again there may not be any ideal, but various compromises. 

Oh, and it does change with optical size. Further, the tightening of display vs text is probably best not simply tracking tighter. The oo and ll may work a little differently--at least that's Slimbach's view.      </div>

So there's an inverse relationship, but I don't imagine that it's a linear one.

I imagine a natural process having taken place where the typecasters explored this and came to the evident conclusion that there is a minimum amount of sidebearing needed to keep type in good shape (at least for a period long enough…).

Readers would of course become accustomed to this and notice discrepancies from this practice, making it kind of obligatory to continue, even after we left metal type behind.

Kent:
<em>"You’re saying that it seems that for smaller sizes the space inside letters is usually adjusted more than the space between letters. Did I get that right?"</em>
No &ndash; I meant it exactly the other way round! As in, the spacing needs to change more than the letterforms/counters. Sorry if I was being confusing. :-/

<em>"can you explain what you base this statement on?"</em>
OK, here comes the big disclaimer: Yes, I was thinking about text vs. small text. But to be honest, I wasn't strictly "looking" at anything &ndash; more drawing from what I'm used to seeing. I'll gladly go and see if I can find examples to illustrate this.

Though now I'm wondering if a lot of what I have been seeing is not actually the proper way of doing things, as I'm probably somewhat used to seeing text set at less than the intended point size, and tracked out (hell, they taught us that at school, too). But the interesting thing is, that still is more readable then than when it's not tracked out (and the counters vs. spacing ratio stays the same). And the opposite &ndash; a really wide font for small text that's spaced tight &ndash; is definitely not going to be easily readable. Which brings up the question if inter-letter spacing is by definition more of a deciding factor for readability than the space inside the letters.

***

William, thank you for this thoughtful post! FWIW, of course my interest in spacing has been triggered anew by thinking about spacing my font; so this list of criteria you posted seems most helpful in a practical way too.

Hey Ben, you might be on to something there – the concepts of clotting, and "acuteness" of the eye, sound pretty plausible to me, in the way that it might be an issue of resolution (both of the eye maybe, but more importantly paper and ink), so that the letters need to be separated from each other a bit more? (Which again would demonstrate the heightened importance of spacing over the intra-letter white for readability.)

Daniele: I'm about to hit the library and dig up that "light" quote.

…ah, so much to learn.  :-)
By the way, if somebody feels I shouldn't post and ask the experts about such things before doing my own research, I can see their point. My hunger for learning is sometimes more urgent than I can read everything I'd need/want to right now; and I love these sorts of threads &ndash; but please tell me if I'm being too demanding.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, the passage from my Typo #13 text you quote above is about design, more specifically, what I call role-architectures, or construction. “Perceptual distances between letterforms must be great enough to minimize criterial cue confusions or masking. But not be so large that cross-letter binding or constructive conjunction is inhibited.” Perceptual distance is a cognitive psychology term for how dissimilar or similar letters are. Hrant did some really nice work on this years ago.

Perceptual distances are calculated from letter confusion matrices, which are experimentally derived. For example an a and an e are more often confused than an a and an m, so the perceptual distance between a and m is greater than between a and e. Herman Bouma did some nice charting of perceptual distances that corresponds nicely with Hrant's chart of similars and modulars.

My comment on spacing follows the passage you quoted. I say: “If spacing between letterforms is not in synchronicity with the space inside enclosed forms—with the way the letterform set uses its cartesian space—there are computation costs at the visual cortex level, because the saliencies can’t compound effectively--the ‘saliency maps’ are thrown off. Configural cues become harder to assemble. Conjunctivities are weakened. The wholistic response bias compromised. So “space craft” facilitates effortless perceptual processing.

I see one factor relating to spacing, and three that relate to scaling for small sizes. For spacing, the blacks must be in step and the whites in synch in spatial frequency terms; for small sizes, perceptual discrimination affordance to the role-unit and evoked-form level must be intact, the ink-spread factor must be accommodated and the dependence of vision on the white must be kept in mind. 

Bear in mind that ‘in step’ and ‘in synch’ are not mathematically quantifiable. In step is not equidistant and in synch is not equivalent in area. I try to think in terms of rhythmic cohesion with the whites, and narrow but not exact phase alignment with the blacks. Fourier transforms, I believe, can gauge this. The method Berlow describes is a way toward achieving it.

Perceptual discrimination affordance is the visual cortex being able to make out what something, for example a letter-part, is. There are size, crowding, and acuity thresholds here. Making out what a letter-part is means resolving marks into shapes the visual cortex knows. I call this process of resolving ‘quantization.’ Quantization underlies categorical perception, the psychological term for ‘seeing as.’ Seeing a d as a d for instance.

In relation to the dependence of vision on the white, bear in mind that vision uses reflected light, and the black does not reflect, so if the white is overwhelmed by the black, the fundaments of readability — perceptual discrimination affordance, quantization, categorical perception and rapid automatic visual wordform resolution — all suffer.

Okay, I wanted to make sure you were talking about the text realm, because in this case I have some visual material that you may find pertinent and interesting. And I suspected that you were drawing your conclusions from relatively recent practice. Which is still somewhat removed from the standard practices from the metal era. 

I'll post a visual a little later when I get a moment to prep the scans.

Very interesting, Peter, this might be why bold works in display but is less readable in text. In larger sizes the white has enough 'presence' for the eye to do its job, but not so much at small.

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, thank you for stepping in and saving me from completely misreading the very passage I quoted! :-/ 
For the record, I thought your text was very well written, and quite understandable for a novice like me &ndash; I should have paid more attention. (I always find it hard, in a new field, to find out which terms are "cuewords" that have entire theories attached to them, and which ones can be understood more-or-less by the basic meaning of the words. Here [in "perceptual <em>distance</em>"] I assumed the latter, probably also seduced by the following paragraph, which is about spacing, like you said.)

I find your post extremely illuminating &ndash; thank you very much for explaining!
This is a healthy dose of food for thought, which will need some time (and re-reading) to sink in.

<em>"Perceptual distance is a cognitive psychology term for how dissimilar or similar letters are"</em>
Ah, I see! I've come across this concept (mostly, actually, in Hrant's work, like his paper in "Graphic Design & Reading" [now I sure hope I'm not mixing up things again]).

<em>"For spacing, the blacks must be in step and the whites in synch in spatial frequency terms"</em>
Ahha! So to think in terms of linear distance for the black, and area for the white &ndash; a little illumination in itself!

<em>"if the white is overwhelmed by the black, the fundaments of readability […] all suffer"</em>
… but would this hold true for intra- and inter-letter space/white equally, or is it more crucial for the latter?

Ben, there was a recent thread (I think it was titled "Opinions on Meridien for books") that involved a somewhat elaborate discussion on InDesign's optical spacing &ndash; now I'm trying to find it again…

What Peter said above about how to gauge the black and the white in terms of distance and area; and William's points about what needs to be considered in spacing; sure, that is more involved, but also a lot more tangible, and real, than imaginary glasses of imaginary fluid being filled into… counters. :-{

Most of what design students are taught is dauntingly limited. But in many cases it’s the best starting point we’ve got, and it’s up to the students to let their imaginations and judgement take them beyond the limits of pedagogy. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">As promised, here's Jost Hochuli's alternative to water, light. It's actually not half as exciting as I thought I remembered – I should have quoted it a few hours ago, considering how far this thread has taken us from when I first mentioned this!

This is from "Detail in Typography" (1989); my library only has the German edition, so here's my wobbly and definitely unquoteable translation:
[First he goes on talking about the importance of making everything evenly grey with no "holes"]… "Even though the spaces between the lettershapes are not [mathematically] equal, a well spaced word looks even; so this can not be about equal space in terms of areas of space. If we replace the term "space" by the term "light", everything becomes a lot easier, and we can do without unclear terminology…
The light &ndash; the lightness of the letters' environment, the ground &ndash; flows into the counters and the spaces between the lettres from above and below; the light that comes from above is more active than the light from below. This brings about the fact that the letter "n" in a sans serif needs to be a bit wider than the "u" in the same font if they are meant to appear to be the same width optically. In much the same way, the area between "I" and "A" needs to be less than that between "I" and "V" (assuming the same angles on the "A" and the "V"…). This phenomenon cannot be accounted for with the theory of equal areas of space, but very much so with the theory of equal light."

I should add this is a tiny book for students/novices. I haven't read anything "bigger" by him.</div>

For your consideration (and without any analysis or conclusions from me), here are examples of fitting sequences taken from the Advance Proofs for two different sizes of Dwiggins's Falcon, scaled to equivalence. The upper sample is 10 point; the one beneath is 6 point.


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Falcon10_lcspacing_5162.png]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Falcon06_lcspacing_5675.png]

&nbsp;
An Advance Proof was a standardized final proof that was made by Mergenthaler Linotype for each font of new type before the matrices were passed for stock and released to the trade. One portion of the proof was devoted to checking the fitting intervals and base alignments and consisted of each character in the alphabet alternating between a "square" and a "round" letter (i.e., H & O for capitals and m & o for lowercase).

So, this offers an excellent opportunity for us to peer into the kinds of adjustment that were being applied in terms of spacing and proportions, at least in the Linotype approach (ca. 1950s). Griffith & co. prided themselves on carefully adjusted individual drawings for each character of each size, not mere geometric or photographic "blowing up" or "blowing down."

BTW, Griffith is quoted as expressing that he felt the Falcon series represented "an almost perfect proportional curve to the eye." (See Walter Tracy's <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>, page 53 for further discussion of this.)

However, in theory I believe that the perceptual process of reading is multiplex, and that they eye is aware of not only the area of positive and negative space, but the weight of strokes and, as Hrant notes, proximity, or the distance between elements. There is also the issue of scalar versus absolute relationships, the quality of sharpness and the shape of curves. And there are of course visual dimensions of design that we are not aware of and cannot express.

Kent: Wow, thank you &ndash; this is great! I will need to (and gladly will) look at it in detail, and figure out what it can tell me with regard to the questions I had/have. 
I won't be able to keep up the current pace of this thread with that, though.

Hrant: that thread looks like it could actually be more interesting than I first thought it would be. :->

Nick, I just realized that spacing at my school was also practiced with sans serif caps with classical "Roman" proportions (though we drew those ourselves first) at huge sizes &ndash; which is a pretty different animal (I'd expect) than spacing a text font, so maybe some simplification should be allowed for… apart from the fact that most of my classmates already were annoyed by type. :-/ 

<em>"The reader’s eye sees all these different raw visual qualities, and the brain synthesizes meaning."</em>
Beautifully said. I find this exact process to be infinitely enticing (and especially so when it includes actually designing what the reader sees) precisely because it's so complex, not really understood yet, and because it's so close on the border between research/science and design; a tectonic fault between two worlds that is calling for bridges to be built, from both sides.

The V does not have an enclosed counter to battle with. Also, the V joins at bottom along with the W which it is more often visually compared.

It's also apparent that the stem width on the A is done in an interesting way. The lower half of the right leg is clearly wider than the V. But the stem width within the counter, discounting the notch, is the same as the V, or close to it.

This discussion seems a bit too complex for me. Can I ask something?

1. Can we assume that in perception there are scale thresholds where something different appears (‘cognitively’)?  I mean, when you reach some dimension (for example the 10/9 points)
2. Even the definition of area between letters seems undefined, that area is usually unbounded (up and down). How can we assume, for research reason, where the top and bottom boundaries of that area are? or can we simply say that we look only at the 'x-height ribbon' (I think I read this definition in Burnhill Type Space)

1.

I don't think you can pin a scalar effect to an absolute size, unless you make sure that everybody reads every document at exactly the same distance.

So type has to work in different ways for different people, at the same size; or in the same way for different people at different sizes.

Then there is the question of resolution.

So, type in a small brochure, printed high res, will be small and held close.
Type on screen will be coarse and viewed from relatively afar.

Furthermore, it's a mistake to assume that everybody reads in the same way.
The old style faces have a lot of redundancy built into their design; that was practical, as they were shaken up and knocked about during printing, so had to function with bits missing, misaligned, and distorted. However, what is redundant for one person may be significant for another, and vice versa. 

Sans serif faces have little redundancy, so, I would say, are read in more impersonal manner.

2.

Although the idea of "evening out inter-character white space" is a workable and useful principle, perhaps the idea of "gravity" would also work. 

In other words, something to do with the relationship between mass and distance.
So, the gravitational attraction between two close capital "I"s, like bar magnets, is great, and will cause a warp in the fabric of text density, whereas two "V"s, separated by a similar closest-point distance, will have the bulk of their mass further apart, thinning the density.

So it's not the balancing of white space that's important, but the coarseness of the texture of matter, which should not be too uneven, with too much "ink" in the same proximity.

		<div class="commentbody">David Kindersley took the view that even optical spacing, which he sought to automate by determining the optical centre of each letter and then spacing these at equal distance, should override visual proximity such that it is better for letters to overlap than to break the evenness of the spacing.

I've spent enough time working with a variety of writing systems to know that this isn't a sound universal solution and, indeed, even for the Latin script it is one that works with some type styles and not with others.

‘Perfect spacing’ is not only design- and scale-specific, I would argue that it is also word-specific. Indeed, this seems the unavoidable implication of Peter's cross-letter binding and constructive conjunction theory: as soon as you have more than two letters in sequence, the relationship between every sequence of three letters, and hence between all the letters in the word, becomes important. Nick demonstrated this a while ago in context of setting all-cap headings, showing how an approach to spacing that worked well with one word worked much less well with another word.

The good news, for font developers, is that spacing doesn't need to be perfect in order to be readable, and the pair-spacing model that is the basis for most fonts is adequate. This is good news because the alternative is mind-bogglingly complex. I have some experience of contextual spacing for Arabic and Thai, and I can't recommend it as a fun way to spend a week.</div>

Although I don't think one can consider too much looseness to be as bad as touching, I firmly believe that touching shouldn't be shunned outright; quite often allowing things to touch makes the overall much better. So it's basically another factor to balance.

And even better news, for everybody, is that perfection doesn't even exist.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that touching shouldn't be shunned outright: it depends very much on what is touching what, which in turn will depend on the nature of the individual design. If I recall correctly, Kindersley's illustrations of overlapping letters used a heavy sans serif, which worked because the internal white space was minimal and the letters were bold enough to retain their individual identities despite the overlapping sides. As soon as serifs and other terminal details are in play, collisions become potentially messier. As a general rule, allowing two horizontal serifs to overlap is fine, e.g. in the sequence vy, but when terminals of different weights and angles collide the results can be distracting, presumably because they produce a non-constructive conjunction, reducing the cue value of the involved shapes and, indeed, the cue value of the space. This is where contextual spacing alternates come in handy:

		<div class="commentbody">John, I'm not sure I agree, mostly because I don't think "distracting" means what most of us think it means in the text realm; and a collision that's <em>too</em> smooth can spell trouble. A good example is in fact "vy", which can start looking too much like a "w" if the descenders are short. As you say however it depends a lot on the given design.

That said, of course in good type design collisions <em>are</em> managed (like where the ball of the "f" is designed to swallow up the tittle of the "i" in case ligation is disabled) instead of just letting things fall where they may.

--

In the "gurney" example I actually think the top one might be superior! The collisions aren't really horrible, and in the "rn" the greater [apparent] width of the left "induced counter" might make it less like an "m" overall at text sizes.

Thanks for this.

Kent, I will still get back to the images you posted. They are tentatively beginning to suggest answers to my questions. But I need a bit of time.

If you guys don't mind, here's a somewhat tangential (but still spacing-related) question: We were discussing how to proceed in spacing caps in our type class today, and the general advice was that (at least for German) caps are much more likely to be used in mixed-case than all-caps settings (plus all-caps can apparently be spaced differently with some OT feature); so one should actually space the caps "too tight", i.e. space them vis-à-vis the lowercase (which can still mean working on spacing the caps separately, but using the spacing "values" from the lowercase as a guiding model). Any opinions?</div>

Perhaps we have a resolution perception problem here: on my screen, looking at the smaller sized words in the image, the rn sequence in the top word comes very close to looking like m, because the ear of the r loses its cue value by merging with the instroke of the n. In the lower word, using the contextual alternates, the clear separation of the rn sequence, even at this size, retains the cue value of the ear of the r.</div>

Yes, definitely. Default spacing should always be for the most common situation, which is mixed case text. All-caps settings need extra attention, either at the font level (see below) or the application level.

Chris: <em>The capital spacing feature in opentype is still flawed because it treats each space the same. Caps need much more attention.</em>

This is also how tracking works within apps, though: adding a fixed amount to the advance width of each letter. The more fixed space that is added, whether at the font or application level, the greater the distortion of the relative spacing of different shapes.

But note that what you are describing is only how most fonts implement the [cpsp] feature. The feature itself isn't flawed; indeed, it is dumb and applies whatever lookups the developer puts in the font. One could implement the [cpsp] feature as a thorough re-spacing of caps, carefully adjusting the sidebearings of individual uppercase glyphs to provide new default spacing. However, then the issue becomes kerning interaction, because the [cpsp] feature may or may not be turned on in an application, and hence one has no way to know whether kerning between caps should be relative to the default sidebearings or to the [cpsp]-adjusted sidebearings.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, John, you're saying instead of having one class with all the caps in it for CPSP, you could specify each letter individually, and specify how the sidebearings change for each one for all of the caps individually? I don't follow you on why the app could be confused. 

Nina, I don't know what is best, but one way is to space H to work with the lower case o and i, and then to space all caps relative to the H. Then if kerning is off, initial caps with lowercase should be not catastrophic. But then you kern initial caps with all the lower case as needed. And then for all caps you use the CPSP to track everything out when all caps is on. That isn't ideal, but it's pretty good.

Then again, it seems practically impossible to get all caps ideal, as it seems to depend on more than two letters as to how they should be kerned. Also the ideal kerning would vary with optical size. So still the user has to work on all cap titles if they are to look really great. 

So a decent compromise is really OK in my book. Because the ideal seems as a practical matter impossible to get, at least with current technology. I think I heard that Lucas de Groot does use some triple letters as a basis for kerning--I'm not sure how that works. But I'm sure John knows :)

I quite agree. The feature is what it is, a tracking feature with a single given quantity. I should have said instead that I feal the feature does not do what I want it to do.  I have abandoned using it and instead set sidebearings for caps to work best with lowercase (except for diagonals and letters like T and L where kerning to lowercase is always required). I then set positive class kerning for cap class to cap class to get a more respectable all cap spacing. This takes away the need for the user to turn on ALL CAPS even if the text is keyed in all caps--an easy oversight. Even if the userdecides he/she want still more space, they can track some but the problem will be minimized. There is not really that much added kerning doing it this way, typically 4 classes.

Yes, that would work, and would avoid the situation of uneven [cpsp] and [kern] support.

Bill: <em>I don’t follow you on why the app could be confused.</em>

I didn't say the app would be confused. What I mean is that if you use a GPOS feature to adjust the spacing of the caps for all-caps settings, then presumably your inter-cap kerning GPOS adjustments should be made relative to that adjusted spacing. But this means that you will only get correctly kerned call-caps <em>if the </em>[<em>cpsp</em>]<em> feature is applied.</em> In case you haven't noticed: this feature is only applied in InDesign when one explicitly selects the all-caps text setting, not when one simply types text in all uppercase characters, and in many other applications the [cpsp] feature is not supported at all.

Nina's suggestion gets around this uneven feature support issue, but it requires the developer to include two sets of uppercase letters, with distinct kerning for each.

Nina, Remember this is ALL the caps including those with diacritics and all the kerning pairs that go with them. 
As John said to Bill above, the ALL CAPS formatting feature must be selected (from the "Character" dropdown menu in InD) for this to work and it is not always supported by other apps or applied by the user.

Possible for sure, but once done, why not make caps just for caps? i.e. the appearance of all caps can improve somewhere from marginally to a whole lot, by having not just special spacing, but special forms.

We've done this as custom fonts, mostly for display. 
With the general population nearly incapable of handling small caps, we keep all-caps in hiding. 
The three best reasons to make them that I know of:
1. a disparity between upper and lowercase weight or spacing.
2. an angle issue in isolated u.c. italics, like A, M or V.
3 a design with more classical U.C. proportions is desired, and the l.c. has a large x-ht. 
Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the feedback. Seems to make sense to favor this in display settings &ndash; I can't really think of many all-caps settings in text, hmm…

Oh thanks, I've been meaning to find out what that is for a while :-)</div>
