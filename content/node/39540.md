  body: "I actually think Florian was right the first time. If you look at the Bold
    weight of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kuenstler-script/\">Kuenstler
    Script</a>, you will see the same 'r' as your sample. It is different in the other
    weights. The G & D match the Medium weight. If the original of your sample was
    done with a digital font, then I'd say the Medium weight was only used for the
    initials. The reason I say this is that the 's' is also different (and more like
    yours) in the Bold version. Kuenstler matches the looped ascenders and the initials
    better than any other font I saw.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that your sample is pre-digital?
    Sometimes the metal versions are not exactly the same as the way the digital ones
    are done.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's the font I'd use, possibly with some stroke adjustments
    to get the weight to look the same.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
