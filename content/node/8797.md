  body: Snell Roundhand, I think. Either the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/snell-roundhand-script/snell-roundhand-black-script/testdrive.html?s=Driving+Miss&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Black</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/snell-roundhand-script/snell-roundhand-bold-script/testdrive.html?s=Driving+Miss&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Bold</a> weight. It&#39;s hard to tell for sure at the low resolution
    of the sample.

  body: Er, I just noticed you didn&#39;t perform your mandatory avatar swap  <BR>yet,
    Ryan. You&#39;re three weeks late, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to fine  <BR>you.
