body: "Last year I purchased the font family \"Whitney\" from famed \"Hoefler & Frere-Jones\".\r\nI
  received a beautiful type family and was excited to get to work with it.\r\nWhen
  creating a Paragraph Style using Indesign (CS2 and CS3) it neglects to recognise
  any of the Italics.\r\nI contacted the tech department and they said  its a know
  issue and suggested I use \"Find Font\". \r\nFor the amount of money spent you would
  think that this would\r\nbe a working function.\r\nHas anyone else had this problem?
  if so do you have any remedies?"

    own Verlag, Gotham, Hoefler and Didot. They work just fine for me. Can't really
    say I know about Whitney specifically.\r\n\r\nDoes it just not show up, or does
    it work in the text palate at least? How I usually create Paragraph styles is
    to manually configure a text block with the attributes I want, then with it highlighted,
    create a new paragraph style. That new paragraph style should be automatically
    created with all the attributes that are highlighted. The only other things I
    can think of is if you have a character style overriding it or the Paragraph style
    is based on another Paragraph style. Probably not though, if the H&FJ tech department
    admits it's an issue.\r\n\r\nHope this helps?"

  body: "I can make the same thing happen here, and create similar problems with big
    families from other foundries, too. I think that this problem is caused by mixing
    fonts with specific names for each of their weights, e.g. condensed italic or
    book italic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the fonts themselves, it\u2019s just
    a byproduct of complex typesetting."

  body: "Hi Koop,\r\n\r\nI believe my colleagues Jonathan and Ksenya here at H&FJ
    have been in contact with you, but I'd like to follow up with a bit of background
    about the problem you're experiencing.\r\n\r\nWhen you switch between font families
    in an Adobe application, the application does its best to match up font weights
    and styles from one font family to another. Maybe Eric Menninga on the InDesign
    team can give a little more information about this, but I believe InDesign uses
    a hard-coded internal list of style names to know which styles to match up.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance (and I believe this is the problem you're experiencing), if you set a
    paragraph with Times Regular and Times Italic and then switch the entire paragraph
    to the Whitney family, Adobe's internal style name list is able to deduce that
    \"Regular\" is the same weight as \"Book\" and properly switches to Whitney Book,
    but it doesn't make the connection that \"Italic\" should transpose to \"Book
    Italic\".\r\n\r\nThe Italics in Whitney are style linked with the Romans -- you
    can still select some text and type command-shift-i and the font will switch to
    the proper italic -- it's only when blindly switching an entire paragraph of styled
    text from one font family to another that this problem would come up. This isn't
    isolated to just Whitney, we can confirm that the same problem occurs with fonts
    from other vendors that use \"Book\" and \"Book Italic\" as style names including
    fonts from Adobe. You'll find that the same thing happens with Meta Book Italic
    and Adobe Futura Book Italic, among others.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that this is still
    causing you trouble, but I hope this explanation helps shed a little more light
    on the subject. Maybe Eric, Miguel or Thomas from Adobe might chime in a bit on
    this and give a little bit of a different perspective.\r\n\r\nAndy"

  body: I think to use the word "suck" is altogether too harsh. Yes it sucks that
    there is a problem in naming that <strong>many</strong> large families experience,
    but it is not fair to call out Jonathan and his foundry in this way. Can you please
    re-title the thread to something more along the lines of "Having trouble getting
    italics to work in InDesign"?

    and beyond.\r\n\r\nI understand the problem now, i have had that happen before,
    it's kinda like how Starbucks has Talls instead of smalls. It doesn't seem like
    it would be that hard for adobe to group OBLIQUE, SLANTED  and ITALIC as the same
    characteristic, or cross-reference the weights BOOK or ROMAN with REGULAR. However,
    if the foundary decided to be jerks and call the style/weight something absurd
    like \"french toast,\" then yeah, that would be dumb."

  body: "wow! thanks' for all your amazing feedback especially andyclymer, you definitely
    went above and beyond on this matter on your explanation. I now understand what
    is going on, I was just very frustrated and thats why the word \"suck\" was in
    the title. I meant for \"suck\" to be describing my frustration and not the foundry
    at all, they have been amazing with their support. I did change the title of the
    post by removing the word suck as it is a bit harsh. I appreciate you submitting
    this report to Adobe Andy, you are a great person. I am in complete awe that Adobe
    has not made this simple correction? it would make many life's simpler, that is
    why they created paragraph and character styles, right.\r\nAgain, thank's for
    the amazing feedback."

    not so simple. Naming conventions vary wildly, and if Adobe changes the way it\u2019s
    handled to work with one set of names something else will break. Indesign can\u2019t
    be perfect because it doesn\u2019t exist in a perfect world."
