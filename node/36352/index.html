  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I asked this question to [[James Grieshaber]], [[Kent Lew]], and [[Stephen Coles]] with various results, but if there were ONE typeface on the face of the earth that you&rsquo;d rather never see again, what would it be, and why?</p>
<p>(If you list P<em>pyr</em>s, C<em>mic S</em>ns, or any other typeface that could be found on 2002 Free Fonts, you&rsquo;re not trying hard enough.)</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s mine:</p>
<p><strong>ITC [[Souvenir]]</strong> (Particularly the bastard mono.)</p>
<p>This typeface is so ugly, yet it&rsquo;s everywhere. The roundness doesn&rsquo;t come across as round, it comes across as soft. And in that not-good soft way. Although designed by Morris Fuller Benton in the 10s, it&rsquo;s too 70s, in the bad feathered hair and brown tinted eyeglasses way. I would rather live in a world where Souvenir does not exist.</p>
<p>Your turn.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been very guilty of using Benguiat and Curlz in a professional application. Although I can say I wanted to use Benguiat for an Art Nouveau poster so it was sort of the correct application, I guess the same can be said about Harrington. There was no excuse for using Curlz though.</p>

<p>I guess you are saying you&rsquo;d like to ban all poorly made fonts with this odd blanket statement? Or is it the free part that bothers you?</p>
<p>They are certainly better than many of the alternatives. That they are often recommended here says a lot. Some freeware sites are often understandably deleted by the moderators because they have commercial fonts.</p>
<p>If you look, you can also find some fun nuggets there.</p>

<p>That is understandable if you are &ldquo;in the biz&rdquo;. For those of us not charging their purchases off to a customer, Dafont kinda rocks.</p>
<p>And they are pretty good about protecting you guys.</p>
<p>As an aside, the whole knock-off argument seems pretty well shot down by companies like Adobe and Microsoft, I am am following the common reasoning in another thread (something about &ldquo;Bloody rip-offs&rdquo;)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like fashion. I don&rsquo;t blame bell bottoms for the sixties. And I don&rsquo;t blame Souvenir for the seventies. But somebody wearing bell bottoms in 2007, or using Souvenir in 2007, had better be going to a retro party!</p>
<p>Admittedly some fonts have a quality that makes them appropriate over a large spectrum of projects. And some fonts are so well crafted that a person has got to be inept to set them badly. But most fonts suffer because of lazy or indifferent type specification.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Once upon a time, about 8 years ago I had the pleasure of hearing a lecture given by Gerard Unger on the mid-century (last) typefaces from France. Before this lecture I hated Mistral (and many fonts from the late, great Excoffon). This hate was tied to a having to do DTP (as it was then called) with so few fonts available to me in the late 80s and early 90s. Silly and childish.  Gerard&rsquo;s rich and detailed stories of driving through the French country side and visiting towns with traces of the old signage and even stories from his own youth mesmerized me.</p>
<p>As it happened I was going to France for the first time only a short while later. I never thought I&rsquo;d visit France, Paris seemed but a dream. I was in a frenzy of anticipation. He had opened my eyes to why the designs were originally created and I wanted to see them for myself.</p>
<p>Now one of my favorite time periods in the history of the poster is Mid-century France. (Well, in fact, I have a huge bias now toward anything French.)</p>
<p>The lesson to be learned: Before you go hating a typeface learn the history and the context.</p>
<p>There are no bad typefaces, only poorly used typefaces.</p>

<p>Like all design, typefaces is a creative byproduct of <cite>time</cite>, coming into fashion and out into oblivion and, often, return with a vengeance. Helvetica was all the rage, so was Avant Garde and it&rsquo;s over abused alternates, guilty here, Souvenir not quite but who knows in 2030. <cite>Exist</cite> is a strong word to use (taken seriously), you might have asked which typeface one wished weren&rsquo;t so ubiquitous <cite>today</cite>? Oops, guess we all know that one, Helvetica, oops maybe Arial.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>But there are some fonts for which there is simply no excuse. Even tho I agree that threads like this are a waste of time, I&rsquo;ve obviously read this one.</p>
<p>A restaurant in my neighborhood is using Mistral (which I hate) letterspaced to within an inch of its life. I have to shield my eyes every time I pass the sign.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make you all suffer with me&hellip; here&rsquo;s my recreation of the sign (couldn&rsquo;t fit in the &rsquo;t'). I think the actual sign is even more tracked out than my sample. Looks like little poops all spread out in a row.

<p>Recently I saw a headline in Souvenir caps and had to remark sadly that it was well-drawn. Compared to a lot of the homemade stuff on myfonts, etc. now, Souvenir is actually well-crafted. Isn&rsquo;t that sad?</p>
<p>JLT: Thanks so much, PAL, for harping on my marginal involvement with Curlz. Let&rsquo;s get the record straight: When I was still working in print production, just out of school, Steve Matteson would give me small custom type jobs for Monotype. One of them was finishing the character set of Curlz. I probably actually drew 11 of the alphabetic characters and filled out the punctuation. In other words, Steve Matteson is the designer of Curlz. I was a production monkey who finished it, much like my role with Woodtype 3. Not the originator, the slavey.</p>
<p>One way for type designers to get experience is to finish the work others start. Matching someone else&rsquo;s style is good exercise. In fact, that&rsquo;s how new designs come about like Leslie Cabarga&rsquo;s new Casey, and Mark&rsquo;s new Kinescope. They start with example art and fill out the missing pieces. Great skill to have. In the case of Curlz, I never thought it would haunt me all my damn days. What did I do, God? Why am I being punished?&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get you Josh, when you least expect it.  &gt;:(</p>

<p>That is actually something another designer and I have been talking about for a while. Is there <em>ever</em> an appropriate use for Papyrus? Especially now, since it has been used and overused and misused and used some more? I honestly cannot think of any situation where I would feel comfortable (and sane) using that typeface.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recall specifics right now &ndash; but aren&rsquo;t the horizontal/vertical stroke widths all wrong? To make a pen achieve those letterforms, the nib would have to be pivoting and expanding and contracting capriciously all the time. The type seems to have been designed by someone who wanted to make something look calligraphic, without even the faint grasp of calligraphic mechanics that I&rsquo;ve attained (and believe me, that&rsquo;s faint). Likewise, people use it instead of a better-designed script. Ugh.</p>
<p>No fondness for Rotis, tired of Times Roman and the faces proscribed at the outset, but Black Chancery actually makes me feel queasy to look at it.</p>
<p>As an aside, one of my least favorite faces in general is Antique Olive &ndash; which a publisher chose to set the titling for a recent book of mine. That would just be bad kluck, but one of the points of the book involves the relevance of page design to communication and meaning. . . .</p>

I can&rsquo;t hate on anything done by FastSigns, but I see pro designers using these weights of Gill Sans all the time, trying to make it look all serious when these weights seem really cartoony to me.</p>
<p>Typefaces like Mistral, Hobo, and University Roman have a different context for me, since I&rsquo;m too young to remember the overuse in their prime. I assume my equivalent would be Bank Gothic, RotisSans, and Matrix, which the condo industry still seems to think works for identities.</p>
<p>Myriad is a face which I think is great in and of itself, but due to the unfortunate fact that it&rsquo;s the default in Illustrator, I&rsquo;ve begun to associate it with really cheap and shoddy work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So! It&rsquo;s all your fault! ;-)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see the differences between Celtic and University Roman. Celtic is much closer in flavor to the Speedball style (&ldquo;Stunt Roman&rdquo;). I remember seeing it years ago in the Formatt (cut-out lettering) catalog. I figured it to be a copy of University Roman, until I noticed the differences. I like the &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; S in the original, but nobody ever seems to include it in any font based on it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>SuperUltraFabulous, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;Cultz,&rdquo; but rather Curlz, by our dear friend Carl Crossgrove.</p>
<p>edited 08.23.07: I see you&rsquo;ve altered the spelling of the type in order to correct it, but it&rsquo;s still not right. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;Culrz,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Curlz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relatedly - a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of the current Typophile that I HATEHATEHATE:</p>
<p>Originally, SUF&rsquo;s post preceded mine, and ostensibly mine was a response to his. But because he later edited his post, it was pushed down below mine. This kind of thing really screws up the chronology of a discussion. I can see adding an &ldquo;edited xx.xx.xx xx:xx&rdquo; notation, but changing the original date and time of the post when edits are often very small? That&rsquo;s not helpful.</p>
<p>&ndash;later&ndash;</p>
<p>Zara: good idea - I&rsquo;ll start after this one.</p>
<p>Carl: I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink. But you&rsquo;ve done such a good job that it more than makes up for Curlz - whether you built 11 glyphs or the whole thing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Linda Cunningham: Benguiat</p>
<p>DanGayle: Yeah, the Mono Souvenir-like thing is horrendously bad, but I hate even the regular face. It’s just so weak and flaccid.</p>
<p>Don McCahill: Hey, I liked Souvenir when it came out in the 70s. It dated kind of quickly, though.</em></p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s really bash Souvenir. First off, it was around since the beginning of the last century. When Fisher Price came to be, they commissioned Morton Sol (or was that Solomon) for a look. He took the old drawings he had (from 1913 and 1928) are redrew them calling them Solomon&rsquo;s (or Sol&rsquo;s) Souvenir. And that becameFisher-Price&rsquo;s logo. (And yes, he was paid well for his efforts.)</p>
<p>Next, it was redrawn by Ed Benguiat and licensed for sale by ITC. Linda, you might hate Benguiat because of Souvenir. One night in the backroom of Photolettering, Ed Benguiat with Herb Lubalin had a conversation about Souvenir. The drawings were pulled out, and given to Vladimir Remington along with suggestions (I guess we call this art direction) on how to redraw the face into a new face, which when finished Ed Benguiat named it after himself.</p>
<p>Both Souvenir and Benguiat had a major role in Science Fiction paperback books. 1970s for Souvenir, and 1980s for Benguiat. Our trouble with it - they were so overused, that most of us in the industry wanted to puke.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>James R. Harris</strong> is no longer with us, but if he were, he&rsquo;d be telling you right now the worse face EVER - was ITC Eras. He would ask you outright - &ldquo;What is this? It&rsquo;s not roman, it&rsquo;s not italic. It just leans there &ndash; quick someone offer it a crutch to help it stand up already.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>The font I could have lived with without ever seeing or using &ndash; that&rsquo;s very hard to say. Yes, there are many I dislike, and so many more that are poorly used. People selecting typefaces that just don&rsquo;t marry the artwork anymore. As a former typographer, I was taught not to single out typefaces &ndash; that somewhere there is a perfect place to use - yes, even that one.</p>
<p>What I can&rsquo;t stand though is poor typesetting. I cringe when I see Fette Fraktur used as all caps - or for that matter, and script used in all caps - and worse - letterspaced out&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you for my sanity moment.</p>

<p>And yes, I like Mistral &ndash; I used a sheet of it as press-on type to design my first letterhead back in the early 80&rsquo;s when I lived in NYC.</p>
<p>But as Patty mentioned, if it&rsquo;s poorly letterspaced, it&rsquo;ll make you nauseous &ndash; wish I had my camera with me while running errands &ndash; I spotted some great bad signage.  Another Benguiat for my collection, a sign for <em>SPECIAL PIZZA</em> in Algerian, and an art supply store that used Mistral, Hobo, and Squire.  They had repeated the word in Mistral on the building but had letterspaced it at around 400%! argh&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also becoming rapidly intolerant of Tempus Sans: the Comic Sans of the 21st century&hellip;.</p>

<p>First, I like Friz - I just wish it came in more weights than just Regular and Bold - I&rsquo;d have loved to own a Demibold/Semibold&hellip;</p>
<p>Second - It was James. R. Harris, &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; to his friends (along with some other names) so for him - I&rsquo;d romanize ITC Eras&hellip; backslant it - I think it was 8 or 9 degrees. I actually used it for MPMS' corporate logo&hellip; years and years ago.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dennis,</p>
<p>A few years ago, I redid their menus. The graphic artist they had put the whole menu in 10 pt. Tempus - did all the typesetting in Photoshop - it&rsquo;s a restaurant, with normal menu changes (items dropping out, new ones added and prices going up - and sometimes, even down&hellip;) it was a mess. To top it off, their average crowd are bluehairs and the lighting is, well there isn&rsquo;t any, it is a very dark setting.</p>
<p>I removed the graphics from behind and just left a beige background (they had postage stamp-type decorations under the Tempus). They wanted to see a Tempus Bold (I know, it doesn&rsquo;t exist - but can be stroked&hellip;) and I finally redid the menu in ITC Giovanni for easy readability - increasing the point size and still having room.</p>
<p>When I got the business card in - I knew we&rsquo;d be back in Tempus &ndash; hey, at least it&rsquo;s not Comic Sans.</p>
<p>So, thank you for listening &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll probably reset it in Giovanni&hellip;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that is frowned upon, but since it is all I&rsquo;ve ever known, I have no point of reference. My main gripe is PS won&rsquo;t allow you to put punctuation outside the justification, which I&rsquo;m told is the way to go. I usually indent all the other lines.</p>
<p>I guess what you are saying is it wasn&rsquo;t professionally done by a real professional. Kind of like me doing it. But at least I wouldn&rsquo;t choose any of the aforementioned fonts. Although I did use Comic Sans at <strong>[[http://www.dopeyhead.com|dopeyhead.com]]</strong> but that was sort of a no-brainer.

<p>A lot of the obvious candidates have already been nominated, but here goes&hellip;</p>
<p>&ndash;Klang  At the printing company I work for, we used to have a client who loved using this font, especially kerned/letterspaced to a ridiculous degree, and it always made me cringe.</p>
<p>&ndash;The Peignot Family  Yes, I know it&rsquo;s a classic, and the titles to &ldquo;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&rdquo; just wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without it, but like University Roman, it&rsquo;s been overused and MISUSED to a degree that just makes me want to shriek.</p>
<p>&ndash;Lubalin Graph  Sorry if I offend anyone by taking Lubalin&rsquo;s name in vain, but as someone born in 1970, all I can associate this font with is bad memories of elementary school, because it was ubiquitous.  And just because you can add slab serifs to Avant Garde, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you should&hellip;  ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to defer this question to someone with more extensive knowledge/experience of web-only/computer-screen-only typesetting.  I know that &ldquo;screen only&rdquo; stuff is a lot more forgiving, because computer screens only have a maximum display of 100 dpi, as far as I know.</p>
<p>I work for a commercial printing company, so my reference point is from that perspective, dealing with things that are printed on a printing press after being run to film on an imagesetter and then burned onto a metal plate&hellip;</p>

<p>JohnH is talking about text that is going to be sent to a RIP for offset printing, i.e., vector graphics. Keeping the text vector based, which it is natively, allows the Raster Image Processor to print it at the maximum native resolution of the image setter, which is super high in most cases. Thus, the file stays small and manageable until the end and becomes gigantic only at the very end of the line, at maximum resolution, when it needs to be.</p>
<p>For screen rendering, however, you can just use Photoshop since the final output is intended to be a raster, or pixel, image. Photoshop CAN handle pixels very well, since that&rsquo;s what it is intended for.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the subject for another thread.</p>

<p>John,</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t because it is a pixel-base that I too, ALWAYS tell folks (stronger than &ldquo;advise&rdquo; and uh hum, not as polite) to use a page layout program. Yes, you can save your type in a layer - but when the revises come - and whole lines get moved around - nothing beats word processing&hellip; With Photoshop you might as well take your time to reset your type because it&rsquo;s faster than cut/paste/repaste/recut/move this/ move that&hellip;.</p>

<p>Looks like we are back to personal selections. I am reminded of a person named Emil who was looking at the head of a deer on a wall. He asked me what I thought of it - I thought it was horrible. He asked me about putting it on a scale of 1 to 10 &ndash; 10 the best. I gave him a 1.

<p>Yes its much nicer in letterpress indeed!
A fumdamental probelm of Times (though it works quite well in text one has to admit)
is that it looks so sharp edged and stiff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Simon!</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you know that&rsquo;s my name done in Times on the letterpress??  :-D</p>
<p>I agree that it looks much better done that way, more &ldquo;real&rdquo; somehow, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>The print shop that I work for, still has a Heidelberg letter press which almost never gets used for print work anymore; mostly it&rsquo;s pressed into service for numbering or crash-imprinting pre-printed NCR forms.  But it&rsquo;s always nice to see people using it for letterpress work, especially if the stock being used is a really thick one.  But these days, most people don&rsquo;t want to spring for the additional money and time of having an actual die made&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I generally avoid posts about &ldquo;worst,&rdquo; &ldquo;hate&rdquo; or &ldquo;nuke it&rdquo; since I&rsquo;ve seen some brilliant pieces using what some think are terrible faces.</p>
<p>But I do have to say I have great distaste for designs that <em>emulate</em> other writing systems. For some reason it bothers me as much as ethnic jokes.</p>
