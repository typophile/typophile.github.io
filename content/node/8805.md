  body: Gareth, have you seen it in person? I&#39;d be curious if it is worth buying
    only the $50.00 version. Does it read well, or does one feel like they are in
    a book-form of a David Carson dream? Do you think that version is still something
    worth collecting?  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.wdny.com/Pages/vas.html" target="_blank">http://www.wdny.com/Pages/vas.html</a>

  body: VAS, regardless of what your end opinion of the book is, is worth $50. It&#39;s
    not a book that you&#39;re supposed to read page by page. It&#39;s more like a
    meandering. It&#39;s pretty cool, but I&#39;m sure a lot of people get ticked
    off by the fact that is anything but typical. If I had one word to describe it
    I&#39;d use &#42;insane&#42;. <BR> <BR>Tomasula doesn&#39;t follow a genre, he
    does &#34;writing as a contemporary/conceptual art form.&#34; <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~andnow/">
    Check out his &amp;NOW Writing Festival</a> from last year. I won&#39;t take credit
    for that stylin&#39; logo. <BR> <BR>This is an interesting post because Tomasula
    works at <a href="http://www.nd.edu/"> Notre Dame</a>, where I went to school,
    and I did a project for him when I was a student. Currently, my former professor
    and I are working on the next Tomasula book, entitled The Book of Portraiture.
    We just started &#40;reading&#41; so I don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s going
    to look like. It does start with the origin of handwriting, so I think I&#39;ll
    be asking some questions here in the next couple months. I don&#39;t imagine it
    being of the magnitude of VAS, as it&#39;s a different publisher and the budget
    is &#42;quite&#42; different...

  body: So, from a narrative point of view, how&#39;s the book? The description is...vague.
    Or, rather, what&#39;s the content of the book? It looks fascinating and I&#39;m
    up always up for experimental stuff, but I don&#39;t like digging through concept
    to find nothing underneath.

  body: '&#34;I haven&#39;t read the whole thing,&#34; said Dan with a hint of embarrassment.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have $50 and only possessed it for a day or two, so, I don&#39;t
    know how its literature holds up. I can&#39;t say I dig the &amp;NOW stuff 100%
    and the idea of &#34;doing something just to do it&#34; &#40;kills me&#41;, but
    Tomasula&#39;s reputation is pretty solid. And I don&#39;t think Farrell would
    wrap art/design like that around a pile of crap. Also, if you like when characters&#39;
    names are the names of shapes then you&#39;re sitting pretty. <BR> <BR>Additionally,
    <a href="http://designobserver.com/"> Design Observer .com</a> lists it as a &#34;book
    they recommend.&#34; I imagine that&#39;s where Tiffany got her link? <BR> <BR>Also
    of note is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226807401/qid=1106622895/sr=8-7/ref=pd_ka_2/104-4692125-8770327?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">
    Amazon has the book in soft-cover</a> now. I haven&#39;t seen that version, but
    the hard-cover is quite impressive. <BR> <BR>Other links: <BR><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/">

  body: 'Tiffany Wardle : I purchased the paperback version due to difficulties ordering
    the cloth cover. But I am thinking of purchasing the cloth cover so I can treat
    this copy with contempt and error, and I am a poor student. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I fell in love with the idea of a novel being constructed visually from a typographers
    translation and relationship with the author.  <BR> <BR>I do think it reads well.
    But I may be more tolerant towards the design than others. But even if someone
    did not enjoy the read, I think it worth populating any collection.  <BR> <BR>Chris
