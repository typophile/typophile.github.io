  body: Akkurat, recently released by Lineto, is not an exact match but has some of
    the flavor of this sample, too. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lineto.com" target="_blank">http://www.lineto.com</a>

  body: Yes, FF Bau certainely comes closest with the wide caps and angled t-ascender,
    but still it has different ear of g and some proportions. <BR> <BR>I would like
    to see the original samples of Schelter &amp; Giesecke grotesk.
