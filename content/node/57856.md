  far - i plan to add numerals and some more glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? How
  does it work?"

  body: "Interesting! I quite like this :)\r\nI think E and F need to be more divergent.
    And V and U. And I find L confusing. \r\nI think AGOQSX need a little overshoot.
    And I'd think about making the Z have corners on the outside, rather than curves.\r\nKeep
    going :)"

  body: The space-filling attempts of F and L are not working out. And at the same
    time you've got that skinny T whose negative space stands out far too much. I
    suggest you explore the potential of massive horizontal strokes; the appropriate
    area for these glyphs is currently represented by the P.

    so perfect and no complete character set for now - just to show the progress.\r\n\r\nWhat

  body: "Groovy.\r\n\r\nYou may want to eliminate one of the slots in N to dispel
    its H-ness.\r\n\r\nI also think that an all-solid version of the whole face with
    no slots would work with the shapes you have now (Though you might want the old
    H for that)."
