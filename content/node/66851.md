  any little bit of progress (in the same way as open source projects do, since my
  background is PHP programming).\r\n\r\nIs a nice bold condensed script with plenty
  of ligatures and final forms alternates.\r\nFor me is a learning experience, so
  <strong>any feedback is highly appreciated</strong>.\r\n\r\nYou can download it
  for free from the lobster font mini-site.\r\nhttp://www.impallari.com/lobster/\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\nPablo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen1-beta12-570.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    glyph (diagraph) \u2014 not a ligature. Maybe some frenchmen can chime in on that
    one. Also the \u0152 might be to heavy where the shapes meet.\r\n\r\nOther things
    I noticed:\r\n\u2022 Bumpy ring in \u201C\xE5\u201D.\r\n\u2022 Bumpy a shape in
    \u201C@\u201D.\r\n\u2022 I\u2019d consider drawing \xA9 in style with the typeface.
    If you keep it as is, you need to fix the top node in the c part.\r\n\u2022 The
    \u201Cn\u201D and it\u2019s derivates have some problems with the northwestern
    part of the curve. The same bumpyness seems to repeat in a lot of the connecting
    tails.\r\n\u2022 I spotted some collisions: \u201Cft\u201D, \u201Cnx\u201D, \u201Cfj\u201D,

    from other \u201Cu\u201D shapes.\r\n\u2022 quite a few of the alternates and ligatures
    set much tighter than the rest of the text.\r\n\u2022 \u201Cr\u201D often leaves
    a huge gap after itself.\r\n\u2022 a lof of the punctuation differs in weight

    there, isn\u2019t it?) If an application has problems with that, it is the fault
