  marking/branding - a solid sans and a complimentary, solid serif. Say you need to
  design them something with more pizazz, like a big fancy poster.\r\n\r\nWhat guidelines,
  other than \"not a sans and not a serif and nothing too similar to the typefaces
  already picked,\" might one follow?\r\n\r\n<em>p.s.: it's Century Schoolbook</em>"
