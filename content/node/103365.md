  forum but haven't found satisfying answers to this:\r\n\r\nCan I modify/alter an
  existing font with a font software and use it in a commercial or non-commercial
  published work, for example a book or magazine. Probably the answer is usually NO,
  but what if I would mention the original font in the book/magazine and that I have
  re-cut it for this particular use? Or do I always need to ask a permission?\r\n\r\nHere's
  an example I noticed:\r\nThe sculptor Henry Moore's 'Late Large Forms' book published
  by Rizzoli uses an altered version of Spiekerman's Meta font (please correct me
  if I remember wrong) both in its headers and body text. As you can see from the
  cover image of the book, some of the letters are strongly altered, such as the upright
  corners of the letters e and g.\r\n\r\nI think the book is beautifully designed
  in every respect, but it does not tell anything about the font nor the designer.
  If anyone knows, I would like to know more, like does this kind of font use need
  a permission from the original font designer or the foundry. Obviously in Rizzoli's
  case the copyright issues and permissions are fine."

  body: This is not Meta but Gill Sans! Also, the letters are not altered. This is
    a special cut by Monotype, probably Series 362.

    I'm still interested, hypothetically, would altering the font in this kind (book)
    of use be okay/legal/no-go?"

  body: Most EULAs don't allow modifications, some do. FontFont does not, unless you
    ask for special permission.  You really have to read the EULA for each font (and,
    or ask the foundry).

  body: "Meta? Definitely not. Gill Sans? I am not so shure. Gill Sans Series 362
    is Gill Sans light. I think that this typeface here is Uhertype Grotesk by Jan
    Tschichold. Revived and expanded by Thierry Puyfoulhoux as  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/tschichold/|Tschichold]]
    It is very similar to Gill indeed, but when you look at \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019
    it becomes obvious that this is not Gill. The g without the bar does not seem
    to be included in the Tschichold typeface as currently available from Linotype
    or MyFonts, but Tchichold designed such a g for the first version of Uhertype
    Grotesk. You will find it in the book Active Literature: Jan Tschichold and New
    Typography by Christopher Burke. So the g on this book cover is either available
    in a customized version of the Tschichold typeface by Thierry Puyfoulhoux or this
    here is a revival of Uhertype Grotesk by another designer which included the g
    without bar in the font."

  body: "1) Modify freely. To me no-mod clauses are rarely socially justifiable (and
    I personally class social justice above profit).\r\n2) Make dead sure the modified
    version doesn't leak out. Obviously in a large operation this is 99% inescapable,
    so don't risk it. Large companies gotta pay up for formal permission.\r\n3) If
    it <em>does</em> leak, don't try to weasel out of the consequences.\r\n\r\nOldschool
    risk/accountability.\r\n\r\nBTW, has there ever been a case where a font house
    has confronted somebody based simply on seeing a modified version of one of their
    fonts used? (I mean as opposed to distributed, like happened with UPS/Meta.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    discover such an event and then hassle people about it.
