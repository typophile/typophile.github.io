OVERVIEW
This is an intro class to making fonts in Fontlab Studio 5 for Macintosh, in practice and in context.
Whether you want to make a ton of fonts or you just want to get more intimate with the ones that exist, you'll find we cover a lot of interesting topics like these:
* Altering existing fonts in Fontlab
* Drawing letterforms in Fontlab
* Importing letterforms from raster and vector drawings
* Automating accented characters in Fontlab
* Building Kerning pairs into a font
* Avoiding common font snafus
* Pixel Fonts
* A quick survey of the history of type design tech
* Font files and management
* The state of the industry, inc. licensing and sales
* Specimens and critique
You will come away with a font of your own design and some basic skills in FontLab Studio 5 and ScanFont.
