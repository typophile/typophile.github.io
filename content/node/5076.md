body: I&#39;ve recently been approached by a small-time scrapbooking entrepreneur
  who wants to make a set of rubber stamps out of a couple fonts of mine, and possibly
  stickers, and stencils, and who knows what else. Although on the one hand such exposure
  could be great, on the other it could get out of control. I know Stuart Sandler
  and Richard Kegler, among others, have talked in these forums about some of these
  issues, but I wondered if others might have opinions about licensing digital fonts
  for non-digital adaptation/reproduction or use as &#34;principal art.&#34;  <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m struggling to come up with license terms that protect my interests without
  simultaneously scaring away potential users of the fonts. P22 has developed an excellent
  Fair Use clause in their EULA which might serve as a model for smaller foundries
  to emulate, which draws a distinction between personal, professional, and commercial
  uses. Is it kosher to borrow clauses from other people&#39;s EULAs? Although I wouldn&#39;t
  crib P22&#39;s license agreement in its entirety, it does contain concepts I&#39;d
  like to work into my own EULA. My &#34;foundry&#34; is both very small and very
  young, and exposure might be good for its own sake. I want the fonts to be out there
  in the world, getting used, you know? On the other hand, exposure in the scrapbook
  market is probably a dead end, commercially. There are font foundries of every size,
  and the license terms that make sense for one company might or might not make sense
  for another. Then again, perhaps a foundry is just as big as its ambitions and its
  professionalism. <BR> <BR>A royalty-based commercial license makes the most sense,
  but I think it would be difficult to apply when both the user and the fontmaker
  are relatively small operations. At the moment I&#39;m leaning toward a one-year
  &#34;experimental&#34; license for a flat fee. When the year expires both parties
  can review how it worked out and renegotiate for a royalty-based commercial license
  or terminate their relationship. Any thoughts, fellow fontmongers?

  body: 'Scrapbooking isn&#39;t necessarliy the dead end we might think. There is
    a fortune to be made &#40;by some&#41; in that field. It&#39;s exploding and going
    upscale now. I was at the National Stationery Show  last month and some large
    vendors show an astonishing range of type: digital, physical, and even dry-transfer
    &#40;it&#39;s back!&#41; <BR> <BR>I attended a trend session in which the presenter
    actually said &#34;Typefaces are a trend&#34; People collect them and like them.
    Non-designers, even scrapbookers. <BR> <BR>While I&#39;m skeptical of how much
    some scrapbooking firms respect the licenses for fonts, I have licensed one font
    in this field and am satisifed it was a fair deal.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also been
    approached by rubber stamp co.s and have never been offered a fair price. One
    even wanted to pay $15 extra to have the right to produce stamps. Sorry, no thanks!

  body: Unfortunately, some &#40;many?&#41; of the companies making these products
    do not obtain appropriate licensing for the fonts they use. Some don&#39;t even
    bother to buy a single license for the font in the first place, but use fonts
    they snagged from friends or off the net. Some rename the fonts and then resell
    them as their own designs. These practices are nothing new, it&#39;s just happening
    in a new market. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen several P22 fonts, the ever-popular and
    ripped of Cezanne in particular; of course, Stuart&#39;s popular fontdiner.com
    font is everywhere, and most recently, entire sticker alphabets made from Nick
    Shinn&#39;s FF Fontesque. <BR> <BR>I think there is some potential here for type
    designers, but only if these companies start respecting the rights of other creatives
    as much as they demand respect for their own.

  body: 'I&#39;m such a stamping entrepreneur as described above, and might have even
    contacted some of you in the early days of our enterprise &#40;we&#39;re about
    2 months old&#41;.  I just came across this forum, and wanted to let you know
    that this is something that we struggle with too.  One of the things that we decided
    at the outset of our business, was not to produce a stamp without an explicit
    agreement in place from the font designer, and financial arrangements executed.  We
    hope that this will set us apart in both our customer&#39;s eyes, and in the eyes
    of the font community as a company dedicated to fairness. <BR> <BR>The trade off
    for us becomes whether the font license makes producing the stamps from it prohibitive.  In
    our initial run, we only were able to work with font designers that made sense
    financially as well as from a design perspective.  We have designers charge us
    as low as $15 for fonts, and designers who proposed licensing in the $3000&#43;
    range.  Obviously, for a startup enterprise whose viability had not yet been proven,
    the high end ones were fairly easy to walk away from.  If in the youth of our
    company, I offended any of you in our dealings, I am sincerely sorry. <BR> <BR>Now
    to the reason I&#39;m here: <BR>I&#39;m trying as well to come up with a defined
    offer to font designers that is fair to both parties.  Our volumes are still small,
    so royalties are hard to do, but a structured arrangement based on quantities
    would be fine.   <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?'
