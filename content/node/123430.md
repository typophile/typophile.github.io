body: Can someone please upload to their dropbox or something?  This isn't a paid
  version, it comes with all Apple products, s0 its not piracy.  Do not upload other
  versions, paid or otherwise.  I need this file for the operating system to function
  correctly.  Thank you.

    installation disks that came with your Mac and you can do a custom install to
    reinstall it.\r\n"

  body: "Not the os-itself, it\u2019s some Apple utilities and apps that ship with
    the machine and/or OS X. Dictionary is just one giving me grief.  Similarly botched
    are a handful of third-party apps I got from the App Store.\r\n\r\nI'm not a programmer,
    but with some research and the little I do know of web-coding has given me a couple
    insights into my font problem.  Of the apps affected, there are two basic categories:
    those whose fonts CSS controls, and those whose equivilant technology, css or
    otherwise remains obfuscated in the compiled code of the app itself.\r\n\r\nThere
    are two workarounds one can achieve with these stylesheets to solve the glitch.
    The first involves editing css file, swapping garamond.ttc and baskerville.ttc
    (which is gone as well) for the font of your choosing.  Make sure to back-ups
    both before and after files.  Good news: you get to further customise your apps.
    Bad news: running Software Update (Tiger thru Mavericks) or App Store updates
    (Yosemite) will overwrite said css file.  The other work around is to merely consult
    the stylesheet, to see what you need to rename your  with a stylesheet, to verify
    the file path to these system font suitcases.  These are generic, non-commercial
    versions of these fonts.  Before deleted, it appeared in Font Book as simply \u201CGaramond.\u201D
    \ The next step is to obtain another free version of the font from one of the
    million free font sites out there, open the font file in your favourite editor
    and change the font name info to \u201CGaramond\u201D like it was.  Export as
    truetype (.ttf). Repeat with the italic, bold, and bold italic versions. Finally,
    compile these as a truetype font suitcase, add the extension .ttc onto the end
    of the file name, and move into the directory specified in the CSS file.\r\n\r\nI
    haven\u2019t tested it cause, while a sound theory, it doesn\u2019t solve the
    core issue, like the majority of apps that don\u2019t have a stylesheet ofr reference.
    \ Even if you are like me and own several commercial versions of fonts like Garamond,
    it won\u2019t substitute Garamond Premier Pro (for example)\u2014or any other\u2014when
    it is looking for something altogether different: another version in another directory,
    with another filename and type with metadata that won\u2019t match.\r\n\r\nIf
    I weren\u2019t on dial-up in Vermont I would download the installer from the app
    store.  An installation disk wouldn\u2019t help as I don\u2019t have a drive in
    my Macbook.  So PLEASE somebody, upload the TTC files to dropbox or something!\r\n"

    have a CD drive come with the OS on a thumb drive.\r\n\r\nIf the font is free
    you could also get it at an Apple Store, there are many in Vermont, just take
    in a thumb drive.  Or from a friend who uses a Mac.\r\n\r\nPeople in this forum
    are unlikely to upload a font."

    the OS was included on a thumb drive, at least it used to be, but the page below
    seems to indicate that recovery is now via the internet.\r\n\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4718\r\n\r\nInstalling
    an entire OS via dialup would be very difficult, but a custom install of one font
    included with the system should be doable.\r\n\r\nOr a licensed retailer may be
    willing to give it to you. Or if you use Apple's backup software, Time Machine,
    or other backup software, you may have a copy of it already.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Well like I said its either baskerville and/or garam0nd (or both in a css
    file) which I know cause I've encountered this before.  Open Fonk Book and disable
    both those faces justy for a minute if you don't believe me, then reopen Dictionary.  All
    the text will be in some hideous extrabold all-italic generic looking serif.

    my own purposes\u2014how to group fonts into suitcases: postscript, dfont, and
    especially ttc.  I looked all over GitHub, finding descriptions of different methods
    which I was not able to emulate.  But that's an issue for another thread...\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: Disabling Garamond has no impact at all on Dictionary.app on my clean Yosemite
    install.  And that makes sense because this font does not even appear in Font
    Book unless you go get it in the Application Support folder and install it, or
    if you have it from another app like Office.   As far as Apple is concerned, only
    iWork might need this font.

    expensive but maybe more prudent to get a local Apple repair shop to make a Yosemite
    boot for you.
