  logo, and current branding, uses [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/|Kievit]]
  and am struggling to find a decent, strong complimentary serif face.\r\n\r\nKievit's
  quite a distinctive face [I also inherited a design with Rotis Semi-Sans and struggled
  with that as well] and the serif is a problem.\r\n\r\nUnless I'm being all \"proper\"
  designer again...do I even *need* to compliment Kievit in the body text with a serif?
  Usability and readability says yes [I have a fair bit of technical info to include]
  and it also needs to be web friendly.\r\n\r\nGeorgia with some wide-ish linespacing
  seems to work at times, but at others...\r\n\r\nBasically I'm having an inspiration
  crisis here - any help appreciated. :D\r\n\r\nn"

  body: Kievit works fine for text, at least in print. I use it for longer stretches
    of text all the time. You'll have to test how it performs on screen, but I have
    a feeling it shouln't be a problem. Serif typefaces render pretty crappy on screen
    anyway, so you might as well try Kievit.
