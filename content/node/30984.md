  body: I doubt that that is a typeface -- it seems more likely to be hand-lettered,
    so to reproduce it, your best bet is to trace it with Illustrator or FontLab.
    I'd be happy to see someone prove me wrong, though.

    try looking for fonts inspired by Arab script, such as Sholomo at\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm.
    It's not quite the same but it's something to work with"
