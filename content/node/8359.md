  <BR> <BR>Despite the horrible image, can anyone tell me the name of this venetian?
  Yes, it&#39;s for a wedding invitation. The curved leg of the R is very characteristic.

  body: Tiff- <BR> <BR>Stand back about 15 feet from your monitor and it looks much
    better. Maybe then you&#39;ll be able to ID it. I assure you that the E does have
    all of the normal serifs. I&#39;m thinking it could be a Garamond I don&#39;t
    presently have on my computer.

    has a pecular R leg, as does stempel schneidler but this doesn&#39;t look like
    either one.

  body: Ok, I&#39;m pretty certain it&#39;s centaur. Sorry about the bad images, even
    expert typophiles can&#39;t be expected to work miracles.

  body: I agree that it&#39;s probably Centaur. The curved serif on the upper right
    corner of the &#34;S&#34; gives it away. <BR> <BR>Seriously, the metrics seem
    to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/centaur/mt/testdrive.html?s=%26++E+R+I+C++A+N+D+R+E+W++S+O+R+E+N+S+O+N&amp;p=16">match
    </a> well. If the original doesn&#39;t happen to be Centaur, then it&#39;s a fine
    alternative.
