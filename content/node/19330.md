  body: I checked Optima, way too much stroke modulation. This sucker is as rigid
    as a ruler.

  body: "Yeah. Ambient is very close. Thanks Dav.\r\n\r\nAnyone has another suggestion
    ? The company told me they just took an existing typeface for their logo. But
    like Lex said, it must have been stretched..."

    target=\"_blank\">Peignot Light</a>. The N and S match up exactly when stretched.
    The H and A are slightly modified.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. Suggest to your client
    that they go with a better logo."
