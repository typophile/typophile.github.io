body: So I&#39;ve constructed a font and the interior kerning and what not is fine.
  However, something weird is going on. At the end of characters the cursor is a full
  em-space away from the words and the weird space grows as you type longer words.
  <BR> <BR>As soon as you type a letter though the letter appears properly kerned....
  I&#39;ve included an image to show you what&#39;s going on. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/51475.gif"

  body: Since the gap between the words and the cursor grows the more you type, this
    suggests a discrepancy between screen metrics and actual metrics. There are a
    number of reasons why this might be the case, some of them font bugs and some
    of them application bugs. To eliminate the latter, can you please let me know
    what operating system you are used, in what application&#40;s&#41; the problem
    occurs, and what format the font it?

  body: Definetly. <BR> <BR>I made the font in Fontographer 4.1 on Windows 2000 Professional.
    <BR> <BR>The errors show up on my computer and my bosses computer &#40;also Windows
    2000 Pro&#41; and in Illustrator, Photoshop, and even Word. The gap grows only
    in Illustrator and Photoshop, not in Word. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help.
