    Buivenga's fonts are beautiful, and I'm really looking forward to <a href=\"http://exljbris.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/calluna-calluna-sans/\">Calluna</a>.\r\n\r\nAnother
    typeface I absolutely love is <a href=\"http://www.raissaki.gr/pages/work.html\">Elpis</a>,
    available through the <a href=\"http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces20th.html\">Greek
    Font Society</a>. I think Elpis is a beautiful typeface, and I love it especially
    because it includes Greek characters (something I wish was more standard).\r\n\r\nThe
    Droid family of fonts, used in Google's Android, is also pretty nice (it's available
    in different places, if you google for it)."

    it extensively for some posters last year (which I did and I don't regret the
    purchase).\r\n\r\nI might use something like Cambria as my main serif since I
    have it... I'd like to avoid spending a lot of money since I've already spent
    quite a lot on fonts.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks I will check out LaTeX, I've been meaning
    to look into that, its been recommended to me in the past.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My personal experience is that if you use anything other than Times New Roman
    or Palatino, university professors will give you a lower mark and make comments
    about your style choices. They are suspicious that the different aesthetic of
    other fonts is the student trying to cover up a lack of quality research. And
    since they none of them actually have enough time to read your paper from beginning
    to end, they have <em> no choice</em> but to assume that there is something wrong
    with your paper. I'm dead serious about this.\r\n\r\nIf you <em>really</em> want
    an alternative font that your professors won't get suspicious about, try using
    Monotype Baskerville. That's about as far as you should go."

  body: "I should probably clarify what I meant in my last post. What I meant is that
    if you try using a font that professors actually notice, then you risk losing
    marks. I have been told this by more than one professor. For example, when I've
    used my Marquet font then nobody notices, so its okay. But if I use my Garamont,
    then teachers get suspicious because its too \"fancy\" looking (long extenders
    are a no-no for profs). \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you're looking for text face
    for non-academic use, then you are free to choose\u2014and here you will want
    to get the best quality you can afford."

    I'm talking about (a) getting written comments on papers from profs who don't
    know this, and (b) differences on the marks of papers of similar quality with
    different fonts. Anyway, I don't mean to derail the conversation, here. I was
    just trying to give some advice based on my experience. I've also received similar
    comments when using one of the new cleartype fonts; I think it was Constantia.
    When a prof says \"use 12pt Times or equivalent\" they mean use a standard windows
    text font. This might well be different in a design program, or at other universities.\r\n\r\nI
    should also mention that one professor thought it was really cool that I was using
    a font of my own making. In this case there was no effect on the mark."

    in font. But if they do, the result is usually negative whether or not its mine
    and they know it. That's what pleases me of using Marquet. I get the pleasure
    of asserting my personality on the work but I don't get dinged for it!\r\n\r\nWhen
    it comes to \"appropriateness\" for academic papers, though\u2014as was originally
    asked\u2014TNR can't be beat. It's what professors expect to see. Plus it's got
    every glyph you'll ever need,looks decent on screen, and prints well on any crappy

    has sharper serifs in general. TNR has vertical serifs on the S, TR's are angled.
    TNR has a K in which the arm and the leg join the stem in a V, while TR's K leg
    sprouts off the arm. Ascender serifs are at a flatter angle in TR, and cut off
    vertically instead of at an angle as they are in TNR. The \"t\" has a bunch of
