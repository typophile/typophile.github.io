  your games. That font is called Garamond ITC Bold Condensed BT.\r\n\r\nYou downloaded
  the font file from Font Zone, renamed the font file to Garamond ITC Bold Condensed
  BT.ttf, opened the font using FontCreator, opened Tools menu, Glyph transformed,
  clicked the open button, double-clicked Eastern Europe, clicked OK, adjusted the
  accents for \u0104, \u0126 and \u0134, removed the dot from j without dot, then
  tried using FontCreator 5.6 Demo version instead. You selected Format menu, selected
  Post, corrected the postscript name to dslash, changed to dmacron, clicked the Dcroat,
  changed to Dslash, changed to Dmacron, then it's also funny!\r\n\r\nThis is your
  font & you use the Insert Characters feature to transform to Vietnamese:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vietnamese1_5175.png]\r\n\r\nYou
  got many new characters but the only selected characters are in Vietnamese.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vietnamese2_4091.png]\r\n\r\nYou
  clicked 6 glyphs, clicked Complete Composites, and lowercase now completes only!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vietnamese3_5068.png]\r\n\r\nYou
  completed u+1EA4, u+1EA6 and u+1EB4 with Add Composite Glyph Member window for uppercase
  and it looked like this!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vietnamese4_3700.png]\r\n\r\nE
  with tilde, Y with grave and Y with dot below works.\r\n\r\nHere is the picture
  with Esperanto characters (\u0108\u0109\u011C\u011D\u0124\u0125\u0134\u0135\u015C\u015D\u016C\u016D):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/esperanto_6435.png]"
