    started asking for personalised help.\r\nI guess it's time to start charging a
    fee ;^)\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Robert Ng it's about time for you to start creating your
    type ID request posts with a proper title. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16349\">You've
    been advised before</a> >:^(\r\n\r\nAnyway, change the name of your file, and
    upload it again. <em>Suggestion:</em> Append the string 'contohabc' to the file's
    name, and you'll never have this problem again."

    my eMail adress out, because I am sure that SpamBots will love this and I am getting
    way too much mails, already. No need for even more Viagra, fake Rolex'es or nude
    Neighbours. :) Thanks. )</em>\r\n\r\nAnd, Dont wonder, Mr formlos said so. :)\r\n\r\n<em>(
    I am sorry, this sure seems to have gotten out of hand, and I dont really know
    why I have been named as the personal Typophile consultant, in here. :)</em>\r\n\r\nSorry,

    :^D\r\n\r\nSeriously now, I'd like to make something clear.\r\n\r\nRobert, please
    don't contact individual IDers for specific requests -- I'm moderator for something.
    Also, <em>never</em> post an e-mail address again in a thread. You must have heard
    of spambots before, haven't you? And lastly, please please <em>please</em> give
    your threads decent titles. I mean it."
