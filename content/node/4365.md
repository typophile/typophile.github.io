  body: '&#62; <BR> <BR>If you are a novice, than you should manually kern, so you
    can begin to understand the subtlety of spacing. Using automatic features will
    teach you nothing. The more time you spend determining the proper side-bearings
    of your glyphs, the less kerning you will need.'

  body: Do you for instance use automatic kerning &#40;and metrics as well&#41;? Any
    professional type designers &#40;my reason for asking you;&#41; using some kind
    of automatic functions inside FL/FG at all? <BR> <BR>a little of topic but what...

  body: I never use auto kern nor auto metrics. Spacing a font usually takes as much
    time, sometimes more, as drawing one.

  body: 'Although auto-kerning could be useful for doing a quick sloppy job, I agree
    with James: it will reduce your own understanding; and it will produce inferior
    results. I&#39;ve never used it. The only auto stuff I use is things like weight
    change and slanting, but even for those a lot of tweaking is required. <BR> <BR>hhp
