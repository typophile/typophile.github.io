body: "About three years ago I purchased a license for Stella for both Mac and PC.
  Both versions are Postscript Type 1. I'm now on Vista using CS3 and my Stella Type
  1 is showing its age -- the font families don't display correctly within InDesign
  or Illustrator, and sometimes they just don't work at all.\r\n\r\nI fired up TypeTool
  and tried a few test conversions to OT and they work great for the most part. Somehow
  I even managed to get the families to group together. What bugs me is that the fi
  and fl ligatures will not work at all. I know this is nit-picky and Stella doesn't
  even need the ligatures, but what gives?\r\n\r\nIf I load up, let's say, Stella
  Lining (type 1), the ligatures work. If I convert that same font to OT, I lose the
  ligatures.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

    maybe that will work. I would try the original fonts in ATM first if you haven't
    tried it already.

    I'll download the demo and give it a try...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

    But I don't think you can do that with TypeTool.\r\n\r\n<cite>Note: The ability

  body: Hi, Miguel. I'm actually just referring to the standard fi and fl ligatures
    (which still may require what you're suggesting). InDesign, and I think Illustrator,
    can activate these ligatures that are available on all TrueType, Type 1, and OT
    Standard fonts. I was wondering if it was some sort of encoding issue. I'm obviously
    out of my element here -- I've dabbled in font design with TypeTool.

    what's going on if it's not too complicated.

  body: "Assuming that the EULA that came with the typeface in question allows the
    user to convert it into other font formats, and that after the conversion the
    ligatures are present in the \u2019glyf\u2018 table or CFF glyph list but don't
    show up in an app, and having never used TypeTool in my life, my very wild guess
    would be that the ligatures for whatever reason don't get a Unicode code point
    or else an improper one assigned and are therefore incorrectly mapped.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    you could download the free Light version of <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/demo.html\">DTL
    OTMaster</a> and drag the fonts into the app for looking into their guts.\r\n"

  body: "Hi, Mr. Blokland. The EULA for Stella actually does not allow for modification,
    if I'm reading it correctly, but I would certainly contact Mr. Feliciano for permission
    if I decide to use this. Right now I'm just seeing if it's possible.\r\n\r\nI
    think I've discovered that Miguel is correct. Avenir Std reveals \"Standard Ligatures
    (liga)\" within InDesign's glyph palette. And while my OT version of Stella shows
    the fi and fl ligatures within the glyph palette, InDesign cannot \"turn them
    on\" automatically. However, I can generate both TrueType and Type 1 versions
    of Stella in which the ligatures do work. OpenType Standard fonts must still require
    the 'liga' feature.\r\n\r\nAll of the fonts I've checked have the fi lig living
    in the FB01 slot and the fl lig living in the FB02 slot -- including my tests
    with Stella."

  body: "Another revelation -- at least for myself: it seems as though this is also
    a Mac/PC issue. I'll use Philomela OT standard from PsyOps as an example. As far
    as I know, the 'liga' feature is not present in this font.\r\n\r\nOn my Vista
    PC, InDesign CS3 will not display either the fi or fl ligatures unless manually
    selected from the glyph palette. However, on my Mac, InDesign CS2 is capable of
    showing the fi and fl ligatures simply by checking \"ligatures\" from the character
    palette.\r\n\r\nHuh."

  body: 'As far as I remember, InDesign automatically substitutes ligatures fi and
    fl when using Type 1 fonts. I guess the substitution is based on a glyph name.
    On the contrary, InDesign doesn''t substitute ligatures in OpenType fonts unless
    OTF files contain OT features. Therefore I think your fonts are correct, the problem
    is how InDesign deals with two same fonts in two different formats. '

  body: "Addison Hall\r\n\r\nIf you have Stella for both Mac and PC, and if you don\u2019t
    switch between the platforms, why don\u2019t you stay with Type 1? Filip blazek
    is right with the substitutions of fl and fi (contained in Type 1 fonts) in Indesign.
    You only have to correct the Type 1 fonts, which is easier than converting them
    to OpenType. If the names are the only problem of the Type 1 version, try <strong><a
    href=\"http://fontworker.freeservers.com/\">that</a></strong>. It\u2019s freeware."

    able to fix the families and the ligatures still work. Hopefully, Mr. Feliciano
    will release a full-featured opentype version with the lighter and bolder weights
    I've heard about...\r\n\r\nThis was, however, a good technical exercise for me.
    I appreciate everyone's help and advice.\r\n\r\n-Addison"
