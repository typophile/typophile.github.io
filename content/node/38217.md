  rest of the letter? '

  body: You will hear many things on this topic if it gets going but let me start
    with the idea that a distinctive shape is helpful in reading the serif on some
    lc i & j forms may help enhance distinction. Another thing it may be doing is
    helping to ensure that even with rougher treatment in spacing that some needed
    negative space is maintained. The bar may also draw your eye to or in some way
    highlight the dot - the real marker of difference for i & j. But as far as I know
    there is no science on this. Just observation & supposition.

  body: If type designers start adding serifs to sans serif fonts to make them more
    legible, or for whatever reason, at what point do you say this is not really a
    sans serif font anymore? It's cheating! Sans serif means "no serifs"! Of course
    there's nothing wrong with the practice---there are many typefaces that combine
    elements of serif and sans serif design to good effect. Interesting that I've
    never heard of a serif font where serif's were removed to enhance legibility.

    of those 'serifs'*  is typewriter fonts where they clearly do serve a purpose.
    I can easily imagine a situation where somebody want to make a new sans & is interested
    in the techy feel of the mono and 'hey presto!' the semi serif is born. Also,
    the fact that these 'serifs' clearly help in a mono may have led the designer
    to extrapolate that they helped in their design too. And depending on the design
    - they might have.\r\n\r\nThe interesting question it seems to me is who started

  body: "Thanks again Nick. It doesn't exactly look like the Ascent of Man(s), (place
    pun here) ;)\r\nEben is on the correct path, I think: the monospace, brought the
    machine readable, which brought the techy feel. The \"el\" (and i, imho), notice,
    is two things, the rounded base on the left, and the serif on the right. Meta,
    e.g. barely shows the latter as opposed to OCR-B, but both have a rounded stroke
    ending on the left? So, some of this, I think also comes from what we're used
    to from...<em>italic</em>. I also note, that Orator, with it's monospaced some
    serif and practically no descent must'a been a reading chore I'm glad I never
    had. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "<em>He may have kicked it off in Officina Sans</em>\r\n\r\nI most certainly
    did not, but I may have re-started the trend. ITC Officina is very much my version
    of Letter Gothic, which has the serif-i. The monospaced faces had to make the
    narrow letters wide and the wider ones narrow. So f, t and r had to be extended,
    i and j got a top serif and the l sometimes both top serif and bottom curl to
    the right. Same goes for cap I. \r\n\r\nWith proportional type you still get the
    benefit of more white space around narrow letters, which supposedly makes serif
    faces more pleasant (if not easier) to read. In other words: putting serifs on
    i, j, l or r makes a sans face less sans. The fact that this also avoids common
    confusion between l, i, I and 1 is really only important for forms, lists, directional
    signs and other information where one has to pick out single letters rather than
    read word shapes."

    It does not solve anything, but may cause uneven spacing. Why does an i j l or
    r need more leftside space than an h or m or n or u? If a sans is spaced too tight,
    all letters need more space. In my desire to know how it feels to design an l-with-a-tail,
    I tried and considered it a pain: Either you add only little space to the right
    -- then you need positive kerning to make sure it does not bump into following
    letters &amp; punctuation marks. Or you avoid these collisions by increasing the
    l's right space, which results in holes in the text image, with some letter combinations
    -- then you need negative kerning to compensate for this. No extra trouble without
    the tail.\r\n[Read as a remark about design technique, aesthetics or personal
    preferences being irrelevant here.]"

    as well,** and faces where the design is modular too maybe. What do you think?\r\n\r\n*
