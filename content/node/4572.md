    the Berthold foundry &#40;St.-Petersburg, 1901&#41;? Anyone familiar with Latinskaya?

    A typeface that claims to be based on it &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/quant-antiqua/quant-antiqua/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Quant Antiqua, from Paratype</a>&#41; is available, but that may
    be all you can find these days. It has a few resemblances, but many more differences.
    For example, the a, i, e and y in your sample are quite different in Quant Antiqua.
    The M is similar, but that is the only u.c. letter in your sample.
