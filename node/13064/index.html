		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here a couple of quick impressions. I like it in general and it looks like a fun face to use - there are some things that I would consider tweaking</p>
<p>the &lsquo;a&rsquo; is so open that it starts to be hard to read. What about a straight line instead like the &lsquo;e&rsquo;. The e is pretty sweet. P R &amp; Z too.</p>
<p>Why is it spaced so tightly? I think these forms would do better with a bit more air between them.</p>
<p>In general I think I&rsquo;d like the see just a little less roman feeling in this. I think it&rsquo;s there to give the face some teeth or sharpness The R with tail especially gives me that feeling. And the 7. I think they work well - although the R&rsquo;s longer tail seems a little weak to me. Maybe give it a bit more weight.</p>
<p>But some letters seem like they would be better off  a little softer or more whimsical. The W M H &amp; T feel that way to me. The B is an example of a better hybrid I think.</p>
<p>I could find more to say but that is what initially jumped out at me,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The new &lsquo;a&rsquo; seems much improved to me. Overall things seem pretty dang sweet! Looking at the PDF this is what I am still wondering about:</p>
<p>a: maybe a slight additional reduction of the height of the bottom counter shape. Not key. It&rsquo;s nice as is too. You could raise the top arm a little as an over-shoot&hellip; Altrenate?
b: there isn&rsquo;t one but it looks like there could be. - no biggie I suppose but it looks like it might be easy to have! I guess it could put pressure on the idea that there should be every other letter in LC though&hellip;
J; What about an altrenate j or even two? You could have a longer one to start but also looking at the K the top arm looks like something you could use to build an exciting altrenate bottom of a J. Sort of like the two Rs. See what I mean?
P: What about an Open P altrenate like the R?
S: What about an Altrenate? There are several letters in your font that have a fullness - the B, R, and a are examples - that I think might be brought into an Altrenate S. This comment applies to the Y too.</p>
<p>The connection of the 6&rsquo;s counter seems like it is too straight. 9 too - what about making these open like the R.</p>
<p>I think that Ampersand needs some work!</p>
<p>Okay enouugh pummeling!</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>a: If I shorten the counter of the a, would that reduce or exacerbate the old-d appearance? Would eliminating the bend - making it more like 6 and 9 - help? Or open? I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m kind of attached to the a as it is, and the character of the whole face kind of hinges on it.</p>
<p>b: Ascenders are not in the cards for this face, but I may try creating a complete normal duocase version of the face sometime.</p>
<p>J, P: Good ideas.</p>
<p>S: I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean by an alternate here. If the existing S lacks that quality, it should be changed. Raise the center?</p>
<p>6, 9: I&rsquo;ll consider open, but might it work to curve inward more, rounding the counters?</p>
<p>A note on alternates: I don&rsquo;t have the budget for Opentype capability. I have room for one alternate each where the capitals go.</p>

<p>a I don&rsquo;t want to say you have to change the &lsquo;a&rsquo;. It is really good. I just have some ideas about what I might do to get a last bit of perfection into it. I could be wrong about each idea. I just haven&rsquo;t seen them &amp; they did occur to me. You have to do what you think is best. It couldn&rsquo;t hurt to try these things ( i think&hellip;) - and I think subtle changes at most is what I have in mind. For an overshoot especially. Is there an overshoot already compared to the N?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>b - fair enough!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>J and P - cool.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>S yeah. I think that would make it match the other letters' spirit better. You could also try it the other way I suppose. That aspect of the font is almost Art Nouveau. I guess it has things in common with illuminated letters too. Still there was alot of play in Art Nouveau that you could use to inspire altrenates!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6 and 9 Yeah inward curve would work work too. I do like your open shape since it gives you a chance to show offthe nice blade shape you have in some of the other characters. Either or both. Since it is a display face I think alternates would be way cool. And you have a basis for both versions being quite strrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>altrenates - I was thinking about this too and my sugestion is that you build two fonts where some (but not all) charcters are altrenates and then bundle them. CuruleanA &amp; CeruleanB or some such. This would give you up to 2 numerals &amp; up to 4 letters. I can imagine having 4 Rs for instance. That would be really cool. The R you have plus a long foot &amp; maybe a stubby foot and maybe a lc r?</p>

<p>Anyway, these are just suggestions&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><A HREF="http://cerulean.st/ceruleansample.pdf">Updated.</A> I think this subtle change fixes the a. All a-related glyphs have been revised to match. J,P,6,9 done. Experimentation showed that there are good reasons to keep the balanced proportions of the S as they are; the top half just gets ugly.</p>
<p>Limiting choices has as much importance to the utility of a font as giving choices. For instance, I tried adding n, and it poisoned the style of the whole face, so I removed it to prevent the possibility of someone using it. The end user is often not a typographer, and it&rsquo;s not always bad to make choices for them. Typodermic&rsquo;s <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/soap/regular/">Soap</A>, for comparison, has n but no N, because that&rsquo;s what works best for Soap. The only alternate, t, is tucked elsewhere in the character map so people don&rsquo;t use it by accident.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. A final question, assuming nobody else has opinions: Can you tell me what you don&rsquo;t like about the ampersand? I can tell it falls short of ideal somehow, but I can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This looks great! I really like the new P &amp; J. I noticed this time was that now that all the other letters seem tight &amp; right  - the bottom of the U might be moved down just a smidge - more like the e &amp; the c which overshoot the baseline nicely. I don&rsquo;t know that it needs to go as far as those do - and I also know that it would mean (maybe) altering the R with the long arm so &hellip;</p>
<p>Also - all the letters have a ton of spirit - but the cap Y seems just a little less exciting. You got so much feeling in the others but it seems like a little more in the Y would be good now. It worked really well in the P! The P looks great.</p>
<p>The Cap M &amp; N have very similar widths. I wonder if the N wouldn&rsquo;t be better a little more narrow. It calls attention to itself because it is really roman in flavor &amp; doesn&rsquo;t have the curves you have in the other letters. On the otheer hand an orthodox N is less wide than an M anyway. Look at Hoesfler&rsquo;s Ziggurat for instance.</p>
<p>Looking at the sample of text at 50% I noticed that the leg on the Cap L seems a little long for even color in text. Maybe it could be shorter. Do you see what I mean? Not a lot but just a little. Take a look at some other faces - Copperplate is more like what you have but I would never set a sentence in copperplate. Emigre&rsquo;s Vendetta shows the effect I have in mind.</p>
<p>Lastly I think since it seems like you are feeling like you are done with the letterforms it&rsquo;s time to look at spacing &amp; kerning. The word cerulean looks pretty good. The N seems a bit close to the a..but in general it seems good. The word sky looks a bit open to me though. Actually all the letters to the right of the A seem too close. Look at the spacing between the A&amp;G vs O&amp;N in dragon. See the uneveness? The Word &lsquo;Nouveau&rsquo; looks quite good apart from the A&amp;U.</p>
<p>About the lc N idea. You should do what you think best. I can imagine a LC n working really well - your P &amp; e give mme confidence it is possible. Also look at these maybe</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typography.net/type/shires.htm">http://www.typography.net/type/shires.htm</a></p>
<p>But obviously - it&rsquo;s up to you!</p>
<p>About the ampersand: I think your P has panache. It has flair. The current ampersand just kind of sits there. It doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s ready to go ride a dragon like the rest of the face. It could be the coolest glyph of all! You could have 4 of them! I suggest that you design &amp; redisign them based on a host of additional kinds of shapes. What for instance about and ampersand that looks like an &lsquo;et&rsquo;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The last one is the most convincing to me. But it&rsquo;s serif on the t in the et feels tacked on in this context. Is it a reversed serif from the other T?</p>
<p>I imagine that there is more to try out. Each of the examples you posted looks like it is based on existing forms - maybe too much so. I wonder if you sketched out some new shapes with a pencil if you could get something even better.</p>
<p>What if the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; was taller and or deeper ( descending)  than the other glyphs? It&rsquo;s going to get used in titles like &lsquo;goblins &amp; trolls&rsquo; or &lsquo;meat &amp; cheese&rsquo; ( I am guessing ) so why not let it draw attention to itself with some extra height or depth ?</p>
<p>Check this out too</p>
<p><a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/topics/theampersand.html">http://store.adobe.com/type/topics/theampersand.html</a></p>
<p>I would go through &amp; look for the form you like best out of the many many that exist ( two in the font  would be way cool! ) and then start sketching.</p>
<p>There is huge potential for interest &amp; character in the ampersand.</p>
<p>Since this is a titling/display face it might be an important feature for sales puposes.</p>
