body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on my PhD-thesis in which I try to look at
  the changes in editorial design between 1985 and 1995 from the perspective of media-theory.
  Among other magazines I want to include Ray Gun in my analysis. A more or less complete
  run of early Ray Gun-Issues is however somewhat hard to come by. As far as I know,
  no European archive has one \u2013 Southampton being the exception, but someone
  tore up many of the issues.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to my question: Does one of you
  own a somewhat complete run of Ray Gun from 1992 to 1995 and would be willing to
  let me flip through it? That would help me tremendously with my research. \r\n\r\nThanks"
