    Bolt]]</strong> by  Ronne Bonder, Tom Carnase (1970) from Linotype - maybe a bit
    expanded. I think there were also versions from Image Club Graphics and Bitsteam
    in the past, but they are not available anymore.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"
