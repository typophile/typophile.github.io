body: "Hi again, \r\n\r\nI'm on a (rather quick) quest for a quirky/organic humanist
  sans serif in a heavy weight. The word I'm setting is \"Coffey,\" so bonus points
  for a nice <em>ff</em> ligature. \r\n\r\nOn my list:\r\n[[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/corbel-family.aspx|Corbel]]\r\n[[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/store/search.aspx?q=candara|Candara]]\r\n[[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/mayberry-pro-extrabold.aspx|Mayberry]]\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Bree|Bree]]\r\n[[http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html|Hypatia
  Sans (if I can figure out where to buy it)]]\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/|Lapidaria
  Sans]]\r\n[[http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026|Whitney]]\r\n[[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=433477|Beorcana]]\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_advert/|FF
  Advert]]\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_sans_ot/|FF
  Scala]]\r\n\r\nOf all these, Candara is closest to what I'm looking for, but doesn't
  have a heavy enough weight. Beorcana would be the other, but it might be too \"quirky\"
  for this particular job.\r\n\r\nHelp! :)"

    Bloemsma should fit the bill, although as far as I can tell neither has an ff
    ligature."

    Legato, Productus, Candara, Beorcana."
