  typeface at all?\r\n\r\nIt's from Muller-Brockmann's A History of Viual Communication
  book (page 167 for those who have it).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your answers."

  body: "You're welcome, josh5a.\r\nDigitized under another name? That is indeed the
    64 dollar question. But I doubt it. This font is not splashy or particularly elegant.
    Rather it is a workhorse design -- admittedly with with some interesting features
    -- in a market flooded with sans variations.\r\nSufficient raw material for a
    font maker is available in the 1902 G & H catalog at pages 348 and 349. It is
    online in the form of a huge djvu or tiff file at  <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/ProbenVonSchriften
    \">Archive.org</a>.\r\nNeverless, if anyone HAS seen a digital version a link
    would be good.\r\nDon\r\n"
