  complete with ink blobs and broken characters? The font \"Cracked\" that comes on
  newer Macs has the look, but overdoes it. I'm looking for a serif font that is uniformly
  vertical. To best create the bad printing effect, we would ideally have a clean
  version to randomly switch out some letters. \r\nAny ideas?"
