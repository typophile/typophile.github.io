<p>About how much would it cost to have designed and printed a newsletter like the following:</p>
<p><cite>&ndash; 11&quot; x 17&quot;
&ndash; 8-page tabloid-style (stapled)
&ndash; 4-color screenprinted (I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s color laser)
&ndash; combining text and photo on a 3-column grid
&ndash; on medium-weight uncoated (I think) stock
&ndash; 250 copies</cite></p>
<p>And (for those who got this far) what kind of discount comes with the scale of the run for something like this? (Forgive my clumsiness with any terminology.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Maybe I was being too indirect. Since I feel like I&rsquo;m pretty safe here&ndash;none of the people involved are likely to be reading on this site&ndash;here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing:</p>
<p>I sit on a committee that is reviewing the status of one of my school&rsquo;s instructional divisions, and will probably ultimately be informing the search for a new director of said division. The current director is&ndash;to put it mildly&ndash;a bit reticent with information about among other things how much money the division is spending, but he is clearly spending it somewhat freely.</p>
<p>Among the targets of this spending is a newsletter he distributed to faculty and staff which I&rsquo;ve got to believe is pretty pricey (the details as best I can describe them are in my initial post). I would like to know how much this thing cost, but I don&rsquo;t think asking the director outright will get us anywhere, since we&rsquo;re not his supervisors. To hunt the budget information down would be pretty time-consuming and would raise hackles. (Not that I&rsquo;m against doing that, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s something in Sun Tzu&rsquo;s <em>Art of War</em> about not showing your opponent where your army is going.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, and I thought that rather than bug local printers during their work hours for quotes on how much this newsletter would have cost, I would toss the question to Typophiles who are on their own time and who might toss out some estimates. Even a ballpark figure could tell us whether this is a big deal and worth looking into (even just for the information&rsquo;s sake) or not.</p>
<p>I have to think the letter was designed out of house, since there&rsquo;s no one in the division as far as I know who could do it themselves, which is why I asked about design separate from printing. But if the design element is too slippery, even just rough estimates of printing costs would be helpful.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re not printers. When we want estimates, we go to printers.</p>
<p>I agree that you&rsquo;re not going to get any break on price with only 250 copies. Maybe 25,000, but not 250. And are you sure it was screen printed? That sounds odd.</p>
<p>Of course, if this is for staff, I would have suggested an email newsletter/blog over spending money on printed matter. ;o)</p>

<p>Thus Nick&rsquo;s information was very helpful; that&rsquo;s exactly what I mean by &ldquo;ballpark.&rdquo; And your question is a good one. I doubt the thing was printed offset, but I honestly am not sure how I would tell just from looking.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Maurice,</p>
<p>As several people have already said, to produce 250 copies, the quantity mitigates for digital printing. As a very general rule of thumb, somewhere between 500 and 1,000 copies, you should get a similar cost between digital and litho (which is the alternative, screen printing being another matter entirely).</p>
<p>It is also the case that design and origination costs would be much the same as for producing 250,000 copies.</p>
<p>Maurice, don&rsquo;t hang your hat on this one. You don&rsquo;t know enough about it and we can&rsquo;t give any definitive answers. By all means get a phone quote from a local digital printer for an eight page newsletter this big - don&rsquo;t worry about stock etc., as it won&rsquo;t make a lot of difference on this quantity - get them to quote the best they have.</p>
<p>The design cost will largely be decided on who blinks first. If this is to be a pilot, design cost could be amortised. I expect that the designer (in a situation like this) is also producing the setting and artwork, the cost of which depend on loads of factors (photography, licenses etc), and client&rsquo;s revisions could exceed the original price in any case.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done a newsletter in years, never enjoyed the experience or been that good at it, but I would do it for $10,000 (50% up front, the rest now) for a bang-up job and my undivided attention. There are lots of good people who would do a great job, and then I could let you have a price for doing what they&rsquo;ve done - but anybody can quote someone else&rsquo;s work, in retrospect and without actually having to produce it.</p>
<p>By all means question making the communication in this way, or at all - question the tactic - but there are good reasons for using printed words and pictures - just look at all the magazines about the internet.</p>
<p>Lastly, could I please be considered for the post of director of this division - I&rsquo;m great at instruction and I could probably figure out what the job entailed within a few weeks.</p>

<p>For my part, I agree with Darrel that newsletters should go out by email, so in that sense I still think this was a waste of money. But looking the thing over, it seems like it might have just as much to do with development as with information. (&ldquo;Development,&rdquo; by the way, for those not entangled in higher ed or foundations, is a euphemistic term of art for &ldquo;fundraising.&quot;)</p>

<p>You are noting that all those low figures were mentioning printing only. One design quote of $10,000 was mentioned. (I&rsquo;ll do it cheaper.)</p>
<p>My point is that the design element of this kind of job is the biggest part of the price, and where you need to concentrate. It is going to cost from $1000 (which I expect would be the price from a student or raw beginner in the field) to well over the $10,000 quoted.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want you to think that this is a $500 project because the printing costs are in that area.</p>

What you ahve to take into account is this: The intial design of such is going to be much more costly for the first issue. The following issue will be less since it is more production, and less design.</p>
<p>I would estimate something more like $1,500 USD for the digital printing of this. (I&rsquo;m think HP Indigo or DI press&ndash;it really depens on the quality. If you want cheap (looking) just go color laser). Bleed will play a large roll in this too.
