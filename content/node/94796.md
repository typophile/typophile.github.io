  a Caslon or Baskerville revival. \r\n\r\nHere's the main constraint: since we have
  to do all our typesetting in MS Word (don't ask--it can't be helped), we need something
  with immaculate kerning. Anything less, and our editors will end up spending hours
  fixing crashes. Right now we're using an old PS version of ITC New Baskerville.
  \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    journal?\r\n\r\nHow economical of space do you need the font to be?\r\n\r\nWhat
    other technical typesetting requirements do you have?\r\n\r\nBTW do you mean kerning
    or spacing? Because -at least in Word 2007- kerning is off by default.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    both "classics."

  body: "Well since you ask, [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|here's
    one.]] It was used without kerning for several years in Boston Magazine, so I
    think the spacing is solid. And if I remember rightly there are something like
    13,000 kerns over the four styles, plus all the classes. You can turn on ligatures
    and kerning and choose number styles in recent versions of Word. Also Font Bureau
    will deliver TrueType versions if you want...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  body: "@hrant Sorry--I've been out of the game a while. I meant default metrics
    rather than kerning. Overall visual style of the journal is fairly conservative,
    and the biggest requirements are true SCs and superscripts. Economy isn't a huge
    deal, but Word doesn't offer great control over H&J settings, so I guess that
    would cut in favor of something narrower. \r\n\r\nWe're leaning toward Caslon
    and Baskerville mostly out of a (probably misplaced) historical allusion. The
    school I'm at was founded by Ben Franklin, so a Baskerville or something colonial-era
    would be kind of neat. The journal itself was founded in the 1860s, but I'd rather
    stay away from higher-contrast modern types. I figured Baskerville might be a
    good compromise where that's concerned.  \r\n\r\n@joshua In what way are Baskerville
    and Caslon opposites?\r\n\r\n@William Right now Williams Caslon is at the top
    of our shortlist for Caslons. Thanks for the suggestion!"

    would actually be quite justified, since Franklin happened to be a big fan of
    it! And, as nice as Williams Caslon is, Franklin actually specifically preferred
    Baskerville over Caslon... See the text immediately following the second illustration

    other the other hand nobody could blame you for not being so historically literal;
    you could easily wade into conservative-but-not-Baskerville-or-Caslon territory,
    with something like FF Quadraat for example. It looks very old, but equally young
    at heart. Plus it has a very large number of components that cover a bewildering
    range of applications.\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/designers/fred-smeijers\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the demands of your publication and planned layout relates. Baskerville is lighter
    and wider. I think it works better in wide columns than narrow ones... '

    of Caslon, thats why the Baskerville1757 that I just referred to above in that
    link has a similar small letter a to Caslon more so than most of the current "modern
    baskervilles" out there, but different....Baskerville wanted to "improve" Caslon.

    based on Dutch baroque models, and Baskerville's, based on the English roman style
    developed at the end of the 17th Century and beginning of the 18th by the writing
    masters John Seddon, John Ayres and George Shelley, follow completely different
    construction patterns and mimic the dynamics of different writing tools (broad
    nib and split nib, respectively)."

    too authentic... In any case it's certainly much more authentic than the ITC version
    with its inflated x-height.\r\n\r\n* Avoid the free one, which is surely either
    a clone or just plain lousy.\r\n\r\nBTW, the \"a\" is indeed an interesting \"singularity\"
    in Baskerville. I find it ugly, and I assume that's why so many revivals try to
    change it, but to me if it doesn't express some of that original ugliness, it's
    not a Baskerville.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    e difference for now. There are indeed some typefaces with the name Baskerville
