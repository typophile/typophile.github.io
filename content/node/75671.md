  by <a href=\"http://www.designspongeonline.com\">Design*Sponge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.veer.com\">Veer</a>.
  Readers have the opportunity to design their own line of typefaces for a $500 or
  $150 credit to Veer. Submissions won't actually be turned into working fonts, but
  it's a fun contest nonetheless.\r\n\r\nMore details <a href=\"http://www.designspongeonline.com/2010/10/design-your-own-alphabet-contest-500-prize.html\">here</a>."
