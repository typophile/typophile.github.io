  body: "<strong>Akira</strong> is right, just checked the Parachute site, indeed
    they are. Great thanks for the help!\r\n\r\nStill, judging by the bad karma of
    Panos in the [[http://www.typophile.com/node/39777|<strong>Parachute thread</strong>]],
    cannot help wondering what design has been the 'inspiration' this time. Even though
    the case is solved, my curiousity stays. \r\n\r\nAt least for the serif there
    are many similarities to Anselm, but haven't got a chance to compare the outlines.
    Borrowing there is (as was in Muse, discussed [[http://www.typophile.com/node/43240|here]]),
    but... not exactly sure about the source."
