  for their medical and psychological conditions. For example, if you have an aneurysm,
  the website will recommend you either surgery or statins, and explain to you which
  is the best treatment for you, based on your history and preferences.\r\n\r\nI chose
  Frutiger as the base typeface for this site because I feel it no-nonsense but without
  being stiff and unfeeling. People coming to the site are trying to find their way,
  and need vital information at a personal level. Also, I like the look of Frutiger.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is - is there is suitable serif pairing for Frutiger in this context? It
  will be used for titles, but also some body copy, like captions and blockquotes
  and like. \r\n\r\nI was leaning towards Apollo or maybe Minion, because they look
  great with Frutiger, but I'm not sure if either of those two serve as a good fit
  for the subject matter of the site.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    with many normally go-to print faces (like Minion) not cutting it. In contrast,
    check out something that renders very well onscreen:\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\n(Disclaimer:

    Now we have Frutiger Serif (2008). They are quite similar, with Frutiger Serif
    being a slightly \u201Ctoned down\u201D Meridien. A make-work project in my opinion.
    I\u2019d kick it old-school and go with Meridien. Better for your street cred."

    can only claim Arial and Times New Roman as their Typography knowledge.
