body: "I'm looking for a production technique that uses traditional offset printing
  with inks that can change color with varying temperatures. Specifically, I'd like
  to find an ink or process that can be applied invisibly and will appear when heat
  is applied. Such as a warm breath or touch of a hand.\r\n\r\nI've talk to a couple
  of local printers and they haven't been able to find anything that meets specifically
  what I'm looking for. There are inks that will go down opaque and have a color and
  disappear when heat is applied, but that's the opposite of what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of such a process or where to begin my search?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJenkin"

    be to talk to Brady-Palmer, Inc. They are a book jacket & cover printer near New
    York City. They do amazing things.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bradypalmer.com/\r\n\r\nAlso
    talk to a major ink manufacturer. Find out what their inks can do and then ask
    them to recommend printers who use those inks. Ask your regular printer who their
    best ink supplier is.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to find out if this work needs
    a special stock.\r\n\r\nKeep us posted here.\r\n\r\npowers"

    They were black, but after adding heat (your thumb) they would reveal the Transformer's
    party affiliation. Pretty cool. \r\n\r\nCan I ask what you're designing that would
    require such a unique technique, or is it hush-hush information?"

    by a printer in The Netherlands called [[http://www.ando.eu/|Ando]], in Den Haag
    (The Hague). So you could either try contacting Underware, or send an email to
    the printer.\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote, I've also seen something like it on coffee
    packaging here in the Netherlands, not too long ago. Somekind of promotional thing
    where there were blank stickers on the packaging, which you had to stick on the
    outside of your hot coffee cup and a text would appear. "

    is stored at the proper temperature, part of the label turns a certain color (blue,
    I think it was). Don't recall the winery.\r\n\r\nHey, Will (or Carl or Chris Slye)
    -- I think this might have been that Tempranilla we had at that tapas place in
    Buffalo; does this ring a bell with you?\r\n\r\n-- K."

    I hauled back from Buffalo and I came across the piece with the notation about
    that wine. I think I can get my hands on it again, and I think it was the Tempranillo.
    & I have since seen one other wine label with this feature.\r\n\r\npowers"

    label go from white to blue at serving temperature.

  body: Well, you might look into whether they go from white-to-blue with cold, or
    blue-to-white with heat. Could be either.
