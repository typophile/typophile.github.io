body: "I am having a really hard time nailing down a font.  I know almost nothing
  about fonts so I'm lost like last year's easter egg.  Anyhow, I'm into train modeling
  and consider myself a stickler for the details.  I have a reprint of a 1913 Southern
  Railway Standards book about trackside signs.  I have chosen to reproduce some of
  these signs for my railroad and I have everything but the font.  After asking for
  help in railroad forums I have decided to try here.  Some of the letters match certain
  fonts but then the rest don't match and vice versa.  Sorry for the bad quality photos
  I'm sure they aren't the best for this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated and
  thank you in advance.\r\n\r\n-Mike\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0774_6576.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0776_6485.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0777_4586.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0778_6588.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0780_4087.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0781_6568.JPG]"

  body: "It's unlikely that you'll find a font to match exactly. What you're seeing
    here are not fonts, but lettering templates to be used by sign makers. Fonts were
    not used to make signs back then the way they are today. \r\n\r\nWhy not simply
    scan these into your computer instead of using a font?"

  body: I could probably do that.  The reason I was hoping to get a font was so that
    I could get an unmounted rubber stamp made.  These signs were cast out of iron
    and the letters were raised.  The font would help me define the height for scale
    reasons and the rubber stamp would make the letters raised.  The original sign
    is being made out of wood with the rubber stamp letters so I can make a silicone
    rubber mold and cast several signs in polyester resin.  If that makes sense.

    few similar ones. Full Block is probably closest but also try Burbank or Pullman
    Train.'

  body: Still seems like a scan would work. Note that there some inconsistencies (see
    the R). Scans would capture that more authentically than a font.

  body: Thanks for the suggestions!  There was a font on Letterhead that matched the
    closest that I have found so far.  I also think that a scan might also work.  I
    looked into the scan a little more after your post.  I think that I will try both
    on one sign to see which one I like best and go from there.
