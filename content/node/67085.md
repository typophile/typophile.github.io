  within monospace typefaces; especially more heavily grid-based ones.\r\n\r\nWhich
  typeface succeeds in putting two characters in the space of one, while maintaining
  the same look, feel, spacing & darkness?"

    imply the double of darkness into one single slot."

  body: "One solution I have found is to reduce the weight of the stroke in the composite
    characters, so visually it has the same darkness as 'normal' characters.\r\n\r\nThis

  body: Yes, that could be a solution. Seems to work in text sizes (not so sure, though).
    But in bigger sizes it just looks too light.

    grid.\r\nIn another execution, such as a serifed, contrasted-stroke italic, it
    would be a different problem, and more of a problem:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amoeba2_3521.png]"

    own design</a>, that has an open feeling (and where the <em>M</em> doesn't have
    three verticals), in which the combined characters seem to feel out of place."
