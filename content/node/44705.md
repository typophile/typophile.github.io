  replicate the typeface used on the back on australian (melbourne) train tickets
  - its probably just a standard font used for receipts and such but i couldnt find
  any info on it so thought it probably easy to make my version of it, \r\n\r\nAnyway
  i would love your comments, it obviously needs work its still very new but i quite
  like it. \"daily fare\" is in extended version, everything else in normal and I
  am going to make a thin version aswell\r\n\r\nThanks for comments - sorry for poor
  quality\r\n"
