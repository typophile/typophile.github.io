body: "Hi,\r\nI'm a newbie creating my first font and trying to learn as much as possible
  at the same time.\r\n\r\nI've created all my glyphs, kerned etc and generated a
  Truetype Font.\r\nI'm just in the early days of testing and tweaking.\r\nI'm not
  too precious about the font as it's the learning that matters.\r\nHave run the font
  through FontValidator and I am getting an Error message E6039 (in red) , see below,\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<em>Message:
  E6039\r\nRasterization Test: Point out of range\r\n\r\nEither the zero-based point
  value exceeds the larger of the maxp table values of maxPoints - 1 and maxCompositePoints
  - 1, or the zero-based point value exceeds value for the number of points in outline
  - 1, including phantom points.</em>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFontvalidator,
  via a link, then directs me to Microsoft were I now need to download the set of
  4 Truetype Word Instructions documents.Done.\r\nI have started to read these(without
  understanding all I'm reading!)and I was wondering if someone could explain my Error
  message more easily in layman's terms, and if this message seriously effects my
  font. The font so far works fine in Word, illustrator and Indesign.Is there an easy
  fix I'd understand?\r\n\r\nIt gets a bit overwhelming when I try to learn and fix
  up a problem, only to find I need to study and understand another whole branch of
  typography just to get ahead.\r\n(I'm probably only whining like a newbie, so please
  forgive me.)\r\n\r\nAny...and I mean any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance guys.\r\n\r\nDrj"

  body: "Hi, this appears to be a problem with the way the TrueType file was generated;
    either incorrectly calculating the maxp table, or incorrectly recording values
    in the glyf table. \r\n\r\nThese are things that should be done automatically
    by your font creation program. Could you give us some more info about what programs
    you used to draw the glyphs and create the font?\r\n\r\nJason C"
