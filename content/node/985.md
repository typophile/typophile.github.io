body: Here&#39;s my &#40;as yet unprinted&#41; business card -- the curvy typeface
  is one of my own devising &#40;Pinnacle&#41; and the text face is Arial. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  very content with the general layout, logos, etc. However, I&#39;m not so sure about
  the placement of  the phone number and other info like that. <BR> <BR>I was also
  thinking maybe of switching from Arial to Frutiger. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1448.jpg"

    Also, the title Supreme Overlord doesn&#39;t fit in with the food/famished/glutton
    theme. <BR> <BR>Maybe let us in on the origin of famished/glutton. And what does
    the word mean to a potential client? <BR> <BR>depending on that answer, you could
    come up with slogans...A steady diet of great design...getting it done before
    dinnertime... <BR> <BR>Or you could leave it as is and tell us to stick a fork
    in it. <BR> <BR>Just an opinion. <BR> <BR>I need some food. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '
