  for the elderly and vision impaired? I've searched on the web, and the studies done
  and the advice given by support organisations seem to have fairly general conclusions
  that lean towards sans serif type over serif  and minimum point sizes to work with
  (12-14pt), maximising contrast, using uncoated stocks to avoid reflection among
  others.\r\n\r\nIt seems that people with a background in design or type are not
  involved in the studies or in specifying fonts for use. They always suggest Arial
  or Helvetica, which whilst they are freely available, tend to make work feel generic.
  I am considering Robert Slimbach's Cronos, which has some character and a generous
  x-height, but would like to hear other suggestions. I also wonder if the serifs
  are not such a problem, but the contrast between strokes with some serif faces that
  cause problems in legibility (Bodoni would be an exreme example). For instance would
  not Caecilia be a good  typeface for this audience, even thought it has serifs?\r\n\r\nWould
  anyone like to share their direct experience of working on projects for elderly/vision
  impaired audiences, and the typefaces they've selected or would suggest. Can anyone
  point me to good resources on this topic?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nStuart\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nChoose a legible serif face, use it at higher point sizes, apply generous
    leading, and set the text rag-right. Ensure that line length is fairly short.
    I'm sure that 45-55 characters per line will do. \r\n\r\nPerhaps Robert Bringhurst's
    book on typographic style offers advice as well."

    the ClearviewADA was the best thing he had ever read. But that is just one person's

  body: "While there are serious age-related vision problems such as macular degeneration,
    the  main difficulty for reading as you get older is the reduced flexibility of
    the cornea.\r\n\r\nThis results in the eye muscles around the cornea being unable
    to compress it enough to focus for near objects, such as text. One becomes long-sighted.\r\n\r\nGlasses
    can remedy this, and return the reader to perfect vision, but the situation is
    progressive, so that over the years one's glasses creep down one's nose to maintain
    the same degree of acuity. \r\n\r\nNot everyone gets their specs upgraded often
    enough, and many people end up making do, reading text which is not quite in focus.
    Many prefer to make do rather than constantly upgrade, which is a hassle and an
    expense.\r\n\r\nWhen text is not quite in focus, that which causes difficulty
    is:\r\n- too small\r\n- too fine\r\n- too much contrast\r\n\r\nTypography is multivariant
    design, so it's possible to improve legibility by selectively adjusting these
    parameters. Officials and accessibility advocates are apt to overdo things, mandating
    massive clunky sans type, but that's a bit like shouting at everyone just to benefit
    a few hard-of-hearing. \r\n\r\nSerifs are not an issue. If you go to the \"large
    print\" section of a bookstore or library you will find everything set in serif
    fonts. The wisdom of the market.\r\n\r\nI don't know how old you are Stuart, but
    assuming you're young, why not go to an optician and ask him/her to make you a
    pair of glasses which simulate your vision when you're 60? "

  body: "I'm critical of the research into <a href=\"http://screenfont.ca/fonts/today/Tiresias/\"
    title=\"Debunking the research on Tiresias Screenfont\">Tiresias Screenfont</a>,
    which is not applicable to the large-print use being discussed here. I also agree
    that you just can't trust the typeface suggestions of blind/low-vision organizations.
    They simply don't know what they're talking about. It's even fworse for LD groups
    \u2013 they actually recommend Comic Sans!\r\n\r\nI also don't know of any really
    credible research... at all. Nonetheless, I don't see how you could possibly go
    wrong with Century Schoolbook for fiction. I further hypothesize that, as with
    screenfonts, size trumps a lot of factors, and nice big type (at least 14pt) in
    nearly any typeface that any of us here would agree is not \"eccentric\" will
    be readable.  You  couldn't use Hobo or Balloon Extra Bold, but you could surely
    use  Seria Sans or Quadraat or Balance, particularly for heds.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJoe

  body: "Thanks for the great discussion.\r\n\r\nNick - Your background info is illuminating
    and I love the idea of the glasses (walk a mile in another man's shoes - read
    a chapter with his glasses?) I'm in my 30s and despite the time spent staring
    at montiors, the eyesight's holding on. I'll have a talk to an optometrist about
    the glasses.\r\nI also agree with your comments on typography, and selectively
    adjusting parameters. I wonder whether the large print sections of the market
    are dictated by the wisdom of the market or perhaps by convention as well. It
    fits with Hrants comment on boumas helping recognition but as terminaldesign mentioned
    earlier, most research points to sans serif although I'm not sure on the length
    of the texts used in the tests.\r\n\r\nThe research also points to type size being
    more important than typeface selection (within reason as Joe Clark points out).
    The italics of Century Schoolbook would rule it out for me, as I feel they are
    too script-like for this sort of work. \r\n\r\nIf a serif face, perhaps something
    like ITC Mendoza has merit, with an eveness of stroke weight, and a less cursive
    italic. FF Legato could be a good choice for a sans.\r\n\r\nA little more background
    - I'm looking at typefaces for use in a government department dealing with ageing
    and disability that produces a wide variety of printed material, some specifically
    for a 60+ audience for example. I'm therefore doing some research so I can make
    informed choices that I can justify. \r\n\r\nStuart"

    type size being more important than typeface selection\r\n\r\nWith the important
    caveat that people prefer point sizes slightly too large for optimal reading...
    For the elderly with vision problems, it's a tough call, because you have to balance
    their greater experience with leveraging the parafovea (where a smaller size helps)
    versus the faltering acuity of the whole of the retina (where larger is better).\r\n\r\nLegato
    might very well be the BEST choice for a sans. On the other hand, the more curvy
    a font the more blur (or alternatively aliasing) you get during lo-fi rendering,
    like onscreen.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    useful strategy.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're becoming progressively long-sighted, holding
    the book at arms length in order to focus on the text, that makes it smaller as
    well."
