body: I'm looking for a modern, clean typeface with personality and an interesting
  S for a logotype. I've been toying with the idea of using archer, but it seems a
  little too boring for a wordmark. The wordmark needs to be able to stand alone and
  be somewhat interesting. Any recommendations?

    and make an interesting S for it for a logotype. :-)\r\n\r\nArcher is a highly
    polished face... and that's why it's too staid for a wordmark. But a custom S
    might just do the trick. Although because of the EULA in this case you couldn't
    legally or ethically make an actual modified-Archer font - it would just have
    to be an outline of an \"S\" that you sub in.\r\n\r\nIs there a budget for a custom
    \"S\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    always found DIN Mittelschrift\u2019s S quite interesting and distinctive \u2013
    compare this to the above suggested Morphica and Mostra and you\u2019ll know what
    I mean."

  body: "Well every typeface has <em>some</em> \xABpersonality\xBB \u2013 it would
    be interesting to know what kind of personality you're looking for. Should that
    \"S\" be fluid? Sweet? Cute? Perky? Aggressive? Dynamic? Stoic? Lazy? Mechanical?
    etc. You get the idea.\r\n\r\nKnowing this would make it easier to suggest typefaces,
    but I'd also second what Hrant said \u2013 especially if you're depending that
    much on one letter, a more exclusive approach would be to not make your logo rely
    on a pre-made \"S\" (and spend a long time looking for the right one), but rather
    make one yourself that is exactly the way you need it, or have it made."
