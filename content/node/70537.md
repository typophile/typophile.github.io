  feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm putting together a website for a client and they like the look
  of a font I've found.  The only trouble is it's a bit of a whispy font and doesn't
  have much weight to it, nor does it have a built in \"bold\" variant.  Is there
  a simple way of creating a faux-bold font similar to what the \"faux bold\" feature
  in photoshop would accomplish?\r\n\r\nWhat tools would I need?  Is this something
  that can be done simply and cheaply?  The font has very open terms of use.  Are
  there any legal issues I should be aware of in altering this font in this (slightest)
  way?\r\n\r\nFont in question attached below."

  body: Hey, Antonio.  Thanks for the tip.  Photoshop's "faux bold" option described
    in that how-to is exactly what I'm trying to do... only I'm trying to then export
    the font as a usable TTF font... any advice on that front?

    you need to hire a type designer to do the work. There\u2019s much more to do
    than just adding a light stroke to everything."

  body: "Just to second James, if you do an mechanical bold on the connected script,
    your intersections will get really clotted and nasty, among other problems. Whether
    there are rights problems depends on whether the EULA for the font allows modification.
    \r\n\r\nThese days there are lot of great connected scripts, so looking for another
    might be wise."
