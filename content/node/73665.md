  body: Thanks for the suggestions. Rundfunk doesn't match exactly, but has the same
    general look. Mona Lisa Solid is also pretty close, although the lower-case "i"
    and "y" look different to me. But both fonts are certainly pretty close. Thanks.

  body: "I think the 'i' is the only different letter from ITC Mona Lisa Solid, because
    it has a round 'dot'. Looks like there might be a dot-less 'i' and 'dot' combination
    in the glyph set that would match the sample, though I'm not clear how one would
    do that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
