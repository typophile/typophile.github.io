  body: The only time a drop shadow is OK with me is when it&#39;s behind a cut-out
    photo object isolated on top of a plain white background. But with type--no, never,
    please. I&#39;m often getting into mini-confrontations with the art director at
    my work because he likes drop shadows &#40;he thinks they add &#34;depth,&#34;
    but I prefer flat things to stay flat&#41;. I consider shadow effects an unsatisfactory
    last-resort solution for when you need to set type on top of a busy photo background.  <BR>
    <BR>&#40;Psst, don&#39;t tell anyone, but I usually tone down the effects in Photoshop
    &#42;after&#42; the A.D. has approved the design, and if he ever notices afterwards--so
    far he hasn&#39;t--my plan is to blame it on our laser printer or the photo house.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I usually dislike gradients and gratuitous textures also. I guess it&#39;s
    all a matter of taste.

  body: In some cases on the web, GUI drop shadows can be brilliant - in print it
    usually smacks of photoshop and looks novice. I think it can be done well, but
    usually it&#39;s just used as a contrived way to contrast the type against its
    background.  <BR> <BR>I think it depends more on the person laying out the type
    than the effect.

  body: '&#62;an added value without a real function <BR> <BR>Mikael, I don&#39;t
    think this argument really holds up to the examples I just linked to, as well
    as those that BJ has just done. For example, the <a href="http://www.typedesign.com/logos/crom.html"
    target="_blank">Cromos</a> logo of Jim Parkinson is very well drawn &#40;a modified
    Futura&#41;, and then the red with white outline and black shadow give it a loudness
    and drama that it wouldn&#39;t otherwise have. Of course your personal taste might
    be something more classic and restrained, but I think it is hard to argue that
    a restrained style should be everywhere for everything.  <BR> <BR>I think you
    do have a point that tarting up a poorly drawn logo with effects is like the proverbial
    &#39;putting lipstick on a pig&#39;, but hey, lipstick on Marilyn Monroe looked
    pretty great. And it does on the well drawn &#39;Cromos&#39; logo too.  <BR> <BR>On
    Louise Fili, part of her distinctive genius is integrating illustration and lettering
    so perfectly as to create something unforgettable. And the drop shadows, when
    she chooses them, are part of her repertoire.  <BR> <BR>So I agree with you that
    shadows can be, and maybe are often misused. But I think it would be a big mistake
    not to include this technique as part of a graphic designer&#39;s repertoire.'

    and gradients look bad and shouldn&#39;t be considered. But, like writing instructors
    insisting on using proper grammar until you&#39;re good enough to break the rules,
    I think this thread contains a lot of great examples where shadowing and grades
    do enhance a piece because the designer knows how to do it well. <BR> <BR>In general,
    I think it&#39;s probably better that one does not use drop-shadows because they
    are difficult to pull off tastefully. Fili, Simonson, and Parkinson are all masters
    who <i>can</i> pull it off.

    could come in handy. Displayed in the corner of the screen was the time and tempurature
    in white with a black shadow. If it was only white, it would be nearly invisible,
    and only black would have been the same. That&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve seen
    the effect put to good use. <BR> <BR>Berkson&#39;s examples don&#39;t count because
    most of them aren&#39;t really &#34;drop shadows&#34; as we know them now. Contours
    seems like a good description. I&#39;d explain myself better but it&#39;s difficult
    to type while holding a sleeping baby.

  body: 'I think the basic rule with shadow effects has to do with intent and purpose.
    Putting a shadow on a letter or word takes it out the context of normal text and
    turns it into a picture of text. The text becomes a simulation of a physical object
    and is placed in the realm of illustration. To the naive designer or non-designer,
    it is an impressive effect. It&#39;s like it&#39;s suddenly become a real object
    instead of simple flat shapes. <BR> <BR>I mostly use shadow effects to evoke period
    styles or to illustrate three-dimensional letterforms such as constructed signs.
    Of course, in the styles I&#39;m evoking the shadow effects may have originally
    been used for the same reason that naive designers use them: It&#39;s flashy.
    But, when <i>I</i> use shadow effects, it&#39;s part of the arsenal of tools I
    use to evoke bygone eras. I have to admit, it looks flashy to me too, but I find
    it difficult to disassociate it from the look of vintage type and lettering. <BR>
    <BR>The soft Photoshop-type shadow is a bit different from this because the effect
    is more photographic, a sort of faux 3-d effect, but the phenomenon of taking
    text out of context and making it pictoral still applies. I would only use it
    in an illustrative context. <BR> <BR>There is also the practical use of shadows
    often seen on TV an in movies for text that has to appear over changing or moving
    images as an aid to readability &#40;as in the example Isaac gave above&#41;.
    This is completely different from the illustrative use, although it is sometimes
    a factor in that too. <BR> <BR>The thing to remember is that a shadow is not a
    substitute for a concept. Without a concept, it&#39;s just a pointless, flashy
    effect.'

    in Photoshop, etc.&#41; easy ways out that can look amateurish in the wrong hands.
    But saying that one should never use them -- that&#39;s a bit dogmatic, isn&#39;t
    it? <BR> <BR>I, for one, am not afraid of shadow effects. I use them as part of
    my own arsenal of tools, but I use them not necessarily for nostalgic looks but
    for what suits the design problem at the moment. Often the problem is readability,
    and shadow can be a useful solution. The trick, like most tricks, is to make it
    so that you hardly notice the effect.

    if you go to their &#39;typographic&#39; section you will see a comparison of
    different ways of putting type over graphics for the computer screen. They claim
    that it is most clear if you blur just around the area of the type, rather than
    use a shadow.  <BR> <BR>Check it out and let us know what you think.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BNews.jpg]\r\nThis was for a masthead,
    The Birmingham News (Alabama).\r\nThe dropshadow and the white edge help the name
    stand out as different from the busyness of the rest of the<a href=\"http://www.newseum.org/media/dfp/pdf28/AL_BN.pdf\">front
    page</a> (pdf) typography. Being blackletter wasn't enough! The extra treatment
    also says \"we're important, this is us, this is the permanent part\", turning
    it into a lettered nameplate, rather than a piece of typesetting.\r\n"

  body: "Sometimes dropshadow or glow is a good way to get the text to stand out on
    a varied contrast background. If it detracts from the text, then it is poorly
    used. If it adds readability, then it is OK, and if it can be done unnoticeably,
    all the better.\r\n\r\nIt seems the more I work with laying out text, the less
    special effects appeal to me when done just for the sake of effects. \r\n\r\nHere
    is an example of a stroke added to \"fontplay challenge\" to help it stand out
    in a way that to me is cleaner than a drop shadow:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontplay.com/images2/pricealphabrokesfwillam.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
    dropshadow might be overdone?:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontplay.com/images2/maximilianantiqua.jpg\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    in general, I find when I go back and view things I did a long time ago I am sickened
    by some of the special effects I used. So in my mind caution is advised. No effects
    (when possible) seem to stand the test of time better.\r\n\r\n(disclaimer: this
    advice comes from someone who doesn't really know what he is talking about but
    likes to contribute anyway)\r\n: )\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just found (on this page <a href=\"http://www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/features/type_tips/\">Computer
    Arts - Type tips</a>) these two tips by Mark:\r\n\r\n<strong>16 Make an old-school
    outline effect</strong>\r\nSet some text in Illustrator 9 and select it using
    the arrow cursor. Set both the fill and outline to None. In the Appearance palette,
    add a new fill. This also adds an empty stroke. Set these to any colours you like.
    In the Stroke palette, make the stroke thicker and set its corner attribute to
    Rounded. In the Appearance palette, drag the stroke to below the fill, putting
    the stroke under the fill in the stacking order. In the Appearance palette, add
    a new, thicker stroke. Make sure it appears below the first stroke. By varying
    the thickness and colours of the two strokes, many different outline effects are
    possible. You can add more strokes for more effects.\r\n\r\n<strong>17 Make a
    custom shadow effect</strong>\r\nThis trick requires Illustrator 10. Start from
    the double-stroke we created in Tip 16 and select the lower stroke in the Appearance
    palette. Choose Effect> Distort & Transform>Transform. In the dialog box that
    appears, set Move to Horizontal: 0.5 pt and Vertical: -0.5 pt. Also set Copies
    to greater than 0: the higher the number, the deeper the drop-shadow. The amount
    of offset (and therefore number of copies) depends on your target output resolution.
    For on-screen use, 0.5pt works well. Smaller offsets and higher numbers of copies
    are needed for higher resolution. Also, using a rounded corner on strokes helps."

    shadows and gradients used to only half-way bother me as a design "flair"--- until
    I had to start fixing them for print. Sigh.

  body: Ah yes.. Adobe drop-shadows are bad for print. Especially since some RIPs
    have difficulties with transparency. I have seen dropshadows with large squares
    around them, because of bad transparency flattening. Always check your documents
    with Flattener Preview.
