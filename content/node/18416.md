  body: 'You are right. The designers (Noordzij and de Groot) both studied at the
    Royal Academy of The Hague (The Netherlands) and started designing the typefaces
    at the same time. The question is: are they inspired by each others work or did
    one copy it from the other...'

  body: "Some 10-12 years ago, the German PAGE magazine published a series of articles
    devoted to that topic. Peter Matthias Noordzij apparently felt that TheSerif is
    an unethical clone of his PMN Caecilia and accused Luc(as) de Groot of plagiarism.
    De Groot defended himself claiming that both typefaces came were inspired by the
    teachings of their professor (and Peter Matthias' father) Gerrit Noordzij but
    that they were conceived and created independently. \r\n\r\nA."

    but when you use them, you'll find that they are more different than they are
    alike. Each have very different character. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Personally, I've always thought this story to be a load of crocker sh!t.
    This whole polemic started with that article by Max Caflish in 1997. Although
    initially Peter Matthias didn't appear to have any qualms about TheSerif, he kinda
    got swept along by this whole ruckus which blew completely out of proportion.\r\n\r\nWhen
    in doubt, trust the Type Identification Board people. And I can guarantee you
    that we never have the slightest trouble distinguishing the one from the other.
    Are they similar? Yup, as is to be expected from two students of the same influential
    teacher investigating similar avenues. Is one a clone of the other? Nope."
