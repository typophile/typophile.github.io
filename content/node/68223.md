body: "I'm working on a logo for a artist that does commissioned paintings. Her style
  is loose, colorful, and playful. She works as a pediatric nurse so many of her commissions
  have been \"childrens paintings\" of colorful turtles and the like, but she doesn't
  want her branding to limit her to that niche. Her company name is westwerk arts.
  These are the fist iterations of the logo. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-7_3653.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-4_6682.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-6_4980.png]"

  body: PS interested in getting some feedback on the name. This is what the client
    gave me but is not married to it. Is it clear between the name and the mark what
    the product/service is?

    also very close to the mark \u2014 add more space between.\r\n\r\nWhat is 'westwerks'?
    Is that her name? If not, I'd question why she's not using her name."

  body: "I see your point on the type. The through was this; she does a lot of children's
    art because of her day job as a pediatric nurse, but doesn't want to get pigeonholed
    into working in just that genera. She wanted her logo to reflect the looseness
    of her style while maintaining a refined image. This is to be able to appeal to
    corporate commissions as well as her current client base. I customized the type
    here to add more stylized elements as opposed to using standard sans characters.
    That was the intent. Knowing that do you think that was accomplished?\r\n\r\nHer
    last name is westphal. My suggestion to here was to use the name westwerks without
    the art at the end, but to include a tagline as apart of the over all ID. Something
    more explicitly describing her services"

  body: Does she sign her pieces? Would this logo be on every mural she paints? If
    not she should reconsider using anything other than her actual name. If I were
    to commission a painting I'd look for an artist not a company.

  body: "From typographers point of view: 't' and 'w' are too far apart, and 'r' and
    'k' also. To my eye 'r' is way too wide. Also, same thing with the last 'r' and
    't'.\r\n\r\nI can not see any serious artist signing any work with silk screen
    signature."

  body: "I agree with Jennifer. The name is the most important aspect to any artist.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in regards to catering to a more diverse client pool, it does not necessarily
    mean that a rigid and angular typeface should be used. The mark definitely implies
    that 'westwerks art'has something to with paintings, but it does not portray her
    as an artist. Some might interpret that as a logo for an art gallery. And also
    there is no sense of playfulness or looseness (as is her painting style) being
    conveyed by the logo at the moment, mainly because of the mark being accompanied
    by the rigid typeface.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\nGood Luck with your further
    explorations"

    and I think something else is better to build an enterprise around. The long term
    goal for her is to build this brand into online and brick and mortar marketplaces
    for distributing and retailing her art. So I''m branding more than just the artist. '

    for in the first draft. It's just that wasn't the best choice of a font. I would
    think nice clean, uppercase sans serif. Maybe it has just a bit of character or
    playfulness (just a tad). Using a script might be to formal for a loose painter.
    I think you can probably say professional without saying too formal. "
