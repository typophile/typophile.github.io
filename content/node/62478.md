  body: "Use a sans serif font in a document. Save or export as PDF. Make sure you
    don't embed the font in the PDF. Uninstall the font you used. When you open the
    PDF in Adobe Reader, you should see the Adobe Sans instead of the font you used.
    The weight and proportions will depend on what font you used. Adobe Reader will
    try to match it as much as it can using Adobe Sans. To match the sample you posted
    above, you will need to know what font it was originally set in. \r\n\r\nI don't
    think there is any way to select Adobe Sans directly. It wasn't designed to work
    that way."

  body: "The Adobe substitute fonts have been around since the early nineties when
    the PDF format was introduced.\r\n\r\nAs to what font it was supposed to be set
    in, my guess, based on the overall \"feel\" would be Univers. Hard to say for
    sure. If you have other printed pieces from the same manufacturer, they might
    show the correct font."

  body: Mark, if you go to file/properties/fonts will the PDF tell you what what the
    name of the intended font, which is being substituted for?

  body: This reminds me of a puzzle by Scott Kim in <em>Publish!</em> magazine in
    the early nineties based on this PDF font substitution behavior. They showed sample
    texts in which the original font had been substituted with the generic Adobe fonts
    and challenged the reader to identify the intended font. Some were easier than
    others.
