  body: "That script looks hand-drawn, but the letterforms, especially that 's' reminds
    me of a number of [[http://www.signdna.com/v2/index.php|SignDNA]] fonts, particularly
    [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptSmall5/NewCityDNA.gif|New City DNA]],
    by Bob Behounek. I'm not claiming this sample of yours is his work, but it's possible.
