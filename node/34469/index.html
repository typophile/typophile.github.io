<p>I saw the SF premier of Helvetica last night and I had to run out during the Q&amp;A to catch the last Bart train, but the question I wanted to ask Gary was, at what point in the making of <em>[[Helvetica]]</em> (the film) did he realize this was not a film about a typeface, but about a commentary about the design and cultural landscape we live in (and that we are products of)? His film is really, really much more than I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be much more academic and historic. It was so much more than that. Helvetica is so much more than a typeface, it&rsquo;s a cultural landmark and Gary Hustwit&rsquo;s film put it into great context.<br><br></p>
<p>It was so great to see footage of [[Massimo Vignelli]] extolling Helvetica and the AmericanAirlines mark (that he designed, in Helvetica) put back to back with the Helvetica detractors.<br><br></p>
<p>The other question I would ask is: What is your Helvetica story?<br><br></p>
<p>In design school I had this fear of Helvetica, everybody did. And then I discovered it accidentally when I fell in love with a [[Bitstream]] face called [[Swiss]] (I was a sophomore; it was an easy mistake.) It was great and I spent a whole semester using it. Then in my career it was easy to ignore Helvetica until BMW&rsquo;s brand guidelines dictated it and again I saw it&rsquo;s merits.<br><br></p>
<p>If I were a design instructor, this film would be required material. Kudos again to Gary.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good question.
My case will not be typical, since I never had a formal introduction
to Helvomi&hellip; uh, Helvee&hellip; uh, Helvetica. In fact it&rsquo;s interesting
that I had any reaction to it at all, since the first time I consciously
thought about its [de]merits I really had a weak grasp of typography.
But over time my feelings haven&rsquo;t changed in essence: starting out
with an intuitive unease about it, I&rsquo;ve now elaborated my opinions
with a more studious grasp of what&rsquo;s wrong with it.</p>
<p>BTW, I was also very pleasantly surprised by the movie.
Gary has done an amazing job conveying a balanced but
nonetheless passionate story.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m sure Gary could answer for himself, but from what I got out of his Q&amp;A here in Buffalo, he meant for this film to be a survey of the last 50 years of graphic design, and Helvetica happened to be the vehicle to tell this story. quite ingenious, i think: more interesting than a film only about a single typeface.</p>
