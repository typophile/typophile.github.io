<p>The OP seems to assume common typefaces are in fact by &ldquo;western&rdquo; designers &ndash; why?  For all I know, Matthew Carter could be Australian, and you can&rsquo;t get much further east without ending up at the west again. Also, I wouldn&rsquo;t care if he <em>is</em>. (Just picked a random name, by the way.)</p>
<p>Possibly related to: the discussion a while ago on &ldquo;why are Latin fonts predominant in the type industry&rdquo; (or something alike). I cannot recall if that thread reached a conclusion or a consensus of some kind. Personally, I think a similar point could be made on a Chinese forum discussing their predominantly Chinese fonts, and by Chinese as well :-)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible the answer for the OP (sorry, Saara: that&rsquo;s Forum Speak for &ldquo;Original Poster&rdquo;) is the same as was mentioned in that thread: Money, Technology, Opportunity. But if that <em>is</em> the reason, it kind of <em>acknowledges</em> the statement &ldquo;common typefaces are in the large majority made by &ldquo;western&rdquo; designers&rdquo; to hold valid, and (a) I&rsquo;m not convinced of that (but I&rsquo;m not interested in the cultural background of the designers of my fonts so I never looked into that), and (b) I still wouldn&rsquo;t care if the designer of one of my favourite fonts turned out not to be the WASP I assumed him. Or, gasp, even turned out to be a <em>woman</em> (to take yet another turn).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I could be completely off base here, but I get the impression that Europe has a longer and deeper history of typefaces in general due to having a longer and deeper history of using movable type.  I gather movable type took off in Europe more readily than in other cultures because Europeans had simpler writing systems.  For instance, ISTR reading that movable type was invented in China some time before Gutenberg but just didn&rsquo;t see any significant adoption because it simply wasn&rsquo;t practical for a language with many thousands of common-use characters.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, then European (and by extension Latin) text largely set the trends in printing and type design, and once the digital age came along (and computer character sets became standardized) the support of Latin text became embedded.  The earliest generations of computers were Anglo-American and only supported ASCII (Latin).  As new computer character sets were developed they were implemented as extensions of ASCII for compatibility purposes, and so virtually all character set standards mandate full Latin support, regardless of what other languages are covered.  That logically extends to the computer fonts designed for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many references on myfonts and other sites to designers with Russian-sounding, Japanese-sounding, Middle-eastern-sounding, and other non-Anglocentric names.  Even their fonts tend to include Latin, and that&rsquo;s what we see in the previews (usually).  I suppose if they didn&rsquo;t, the fonts wouldn&rsquo;t be disseminated much outside their own countries/cultures.</p>
<p>Living for five years in Japan, I can&rsquo;t say I ever noticed a particularly wide variety of fonts being used, for either English/Roman text or for pure Japanese.  (Virtually every sample of English I ever saw written used either MS Mincho/MS Gothic or Helvetica; the vast majority of Japanese text outside calligraphy or custom logos always seemed to be either Heisei-Gothic/Heisei-Mincho, MS Gothic/MS Mincho or something resembling the M+ fonts.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Another reason could be that the entire technology <em>an sich</em> is deeply culturally biased towards the Western world. The ASCII table, for example, has been the bane of everything European for literally decades on end (the &ldquo;AS&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;<em> American</em> Standard). After much deliberating, and various more or less succesfull hacks (e.g. the dreaded &ldquo;code pages&rdquo;), the &lsquo;world wide&rsquo; embrace of Unicode put an end to accent related troubles. Or to a lot. Not all of them.
However, in that the Western culture also ruled supreme! Arabic characters, for example, have been coaxed into &lsquo;different&rsquo; code points for their four different forms. If you think writing a case insensitive search routine is a bother for Latin text, you can quadruple the efforts needed for Arabic.</p>
<p>Another example of technology following culture could be the keyboard. Much as &ldquo;we&rdquo; are used to a Shift key to toggle between capitals and lowercase &ndash; to the point where we can mentally extend the concept to toggling between the number &ldquo;3&rdquo; and the character &ldquo;#&rdquo; <em>even though these are unrelated</em> &ndash;, if the keyboard concept was of Arabic origin, one could expect it to have <em>four</em> &lsquo;shift&rsquo; keys to alternate between initial (somewhat equivalent to &ldquo;our&rdquo; capitals), medial, final, and isolated form. (Two shift keys with a binary function may also work.)
But that&rsquo;s still imaginable for &ldquo;us&rdquo; Anglo-Europeans. What if the concept of machine input was inherited from Chinese sources? I&rsquo;m not talking about the clunky 30,000 key typewriter (which is just Western tech projected onto Chinese target audience). In China, an age old habit in discussing ideograms is to &lsquo;write&rsquo; them in the palm of your hand. Extrapolating that to a mechanical method may have led to the <em>touchpad</em> as the primary input source for a computer!</p>
<p>Coming to a point here: if the reason Western font designers are dominant, and there may be &ldquo;not that many&rdquo; non-Western font designers, it is because the entire technology, from storage to display, is based  on Western concepts of data storage, text input, rendering, and font design itself.</p>
<p>This whole story only covers one of my three points, Technology. I&rsquo;m sure a similar argument (long winded, apologies) can be made for the other two: Money and Opportunity.</p>

Absolutely. I learned to read Greek and Cyrillic scripts in practice (although I usually only have a vague idea what the text actually says), and appreciating the letter forms taught me a lot about font design.
I'm teetering on the edge of a similar breakthrough for Arabic (where other people only see random scribblings, I can discern the various letter forms) and I'm hoping to get some extended exposure to it so I can make the jump to actually be able to read it.</div>

<p>BTW Arabic would need only two shift keys (giving the necessary four possible combinations)* but only if you could place any one of the four forms anywhere, which you can&rsquo;t; so Arabs are lucky that -assuming the necessary software environment- an algorithm can choose for them&hellip; and in fact they don&rsquo;t need <em>any</em> shift key! Although personally I happen to be a fan of reforming Arabic to support capitalization. In case that sounds jingoistic: you should see what I want to do to Latin.  :-)</p>

<li>This being something I actually implemented in the late 80s for Broadcast Titler on the Amiga**; and you had to hit the left arrow key after each keystroke. :-)  Those fonts of mine were actually also used to set Arabic and Farsi ads in some ethnic &ldquo;yellow pages&rdquo; directories.

<p>Typing, by the way, on my iPad. Actually the &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo; implementation on this device is dreadful. I make far more errors than usual, and they are way harder to correct (to a point where I hesitate to do a quick spell-and-grammar check).

<p>Race, technology and culture isn’t the whole story—size and circumstance have something to do with it.
Not every European country is as well populated with type designers as the relatively small Netherlands.
And in Canada, with its centuries of European settlers, Carl Dair’s ﬁrst indigenous type design was not made until 1967.</p>

<p>I have grown quite interested in looking at the internal consistency of Japanese fonts, with respect to how they combine the Latin and Japanese glyph sets.  It&rsquo;s rare to find the Japanese font which uses Latin characters that aren&rsquo;t painfully generic.  <a href="http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/design/index-en.html">M+</a>, which is IMO one of the more attractive Japanese text fonts, uses a Latin set that looks extremely similar to Frutiger and Myriad.  (And that&rsquo;s one of the better examples - at least those are fairly nice Latin glyphs, if not very original.)  Of course, it goes both ways - Monotype&rsquo;s pan-Unicode WorldType fonts from the 1990s, for example, use extremely generic Japanese characters (although to be fair, their Latin is pretty unimaginative too).  One of the things I want to experiment with is in designing fonts with an internally consistent character style between Latin and Japanese (which still &ldquo;fits&rdquo; both writing systems).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s notable BTW that some designers are much more restrictive than even I am: they feel that matching the color is the <em>only</em> thing that should be done.

<p>Exactly! But do note that most fonts do have them the same. Why? Because humans like to line things up, and when they&rsquo;re observing letterforms consciously = display typography, it&rsquo;s admittedly nice; but not for immersive reading; and sometimes not for cultural integrity either.</p>

<p>Yes, but how do you do this?  I assume you have no formula or set of specifications to follow?  I assume you just work on it until you feel you have achieved a sufficient family resemblance to make the differing scripts work together without being jolted out of conscious reading.
I think when we write down an exact recipe for consistency, that we are at that moment doomed to failure.  Because different scripts came to be in different ways, there is no Rubrics' Cube solution.  Type designer Humans just have to do the work so that other Humans can simply read it without having to consult a cypher.</p>

<p>This is what I don&rsquo;t believe in, because the functionality of a [text] face doesn&rsquo;t come from formal attributes, especially when you factor in differences in how cultures see forms; such formal consistency ignores tradition (which harms functionality). For example, a &ldquo;literal&rdquo; Cyrillic Trajan cannot mean the same thing for Russians as Trajan does for Westerners.</p>
<p>To me -in a text face- the correct way to approach it is &ldquo;multi-laterally&rdquo;: start form the scripts individually and see where they can meet; and very often they simply can&rsquo;t get close enough to satisfy the important requirements (which for one thing doesn&rsquo;t include the conscious appreciation of alignment) so you snap away (for example by not forcing the &ldquo;x-height&quot;s to align).</p>

<p>By “consistency of overall text colour”, I mean between the two scripts, so that they both appear to be the same weight of font. This is a reasonable expectation for typographers to have, tasked as they often are with balancing the import of blocks of different-script text, side by side on the same page. You don’t want your Greek to look like Regular and your Latin to look like Semibold.</p>
<p>Similarly, with “scale of detail”, you don’t want your Roman to look like a body face and your Greek to look like an agate.</p>
<p>Weight and optical size are formal attributes of a typeface, and they have to be consistent between scripts, or else the settings of at least one of the scripts will require so much tweaking by the typographer that the font becomes dysfunctional for multi-script layouts.</p>

<p>As for trying to match apparent size (which I&rsquo;ve never heard of as &ldquo;scale of detail&rdquo;) as I said I agree that it&rsquo;s very important (mostly because you don&rsquo;t want people feeling inferior). That said it&rsquo;s possible to counter-balance that with color (i.e. make one script smaller but darker than the other) especially if you simply can&rsquo;t make the apparent sizes close enough - think of combining Latin and Arabic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Want to come back to the ideas of this thread later, once I&rsquo;ve properly formulated the problem that&rsquo;s been troubling some of us all year in Reading, basically that the same formal characteristics of a design may be either very very conventional or completely alien in a different script. What some call the &lsquo;atmospheric values&rsquo; of a typeface depends entirely on socio/cultural associations; where formal characteristics may connote a very different era or mood in a different script. For example the broad nib convention in Latin doesn&rsquo;t work well in Thai, where expansion serves the letterforms more historically accurately, as well as more aesthetically. Sorry, I appear to be speaking in fragments.</div>

<p>Anyway, what I&rsquo;m trying to get at is the way that one needs to understand the traditions of a culture in order to avoid unwittingly imposing models or formal characteristics that have different associations. What this boils down to (at least for me) is that in multi-script typefaces, one may need to look beyond a single stroke model as the unifying element, and instead tie things together with atmospheric values, by which I mean the associations and preferences of the target readership, something which is very difficult for a complete outsider to grasp. One thing that I consciously kept in mind when creating Lumen Thai was to draw &lsquo;Thai&rsquo; curves, which meant sometimes going against the shapes that came naturally out of my hand. Also it meant discarding the Latin stroke model and matching things in other ways: in terms of colour (though I&rsquo;ve since realised Thai does need to be lighter because of the amount of superscript and subscript activity and lack of wordspaces), and by aiming for a humanist feel, though in the Thai the swelling stroke of a flexible nib is as conventional as the broad-nib in Latin, so the implementation of that humanist feel is executed differently.</p>
