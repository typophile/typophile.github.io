  feel, both in layout and typography, somewhere like 20s or 30s but without the arts
  and crafts movement or art deco tropes.\r\n\r\nFor the sans-serif font, I was debating
  between Gill Sans, Verlag, or Erbar, and I went with Erbar because licensing for
  Verlag is difficult for web, and Gill Sans is perhaps too common. (That being said,
  Joanna goes very, very well with Gill Sans)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cdn.myfonts.net/s/aw/720x360/154/0/79076.png\"
  />\r\n\r\nThere's not much I can find on Erbar, because anything on Erbar is just
  a reference to Futura.\r\n\r\nWhat's a good serif font pairing for Erbar that still
  has a Modernist feel to it and is legible for long copies of body text? I was thinking
  \"Candida,\" simply because it was also developed by Erbar, but I'm not too sure."
