  at once on Mac (Mountain Lion)?\r\n\r\nThe current 5.1.3 version I'm using has less
  bugs and is nice and stable, but many of the RoboFab Macros seem to be broken, so
  I'd like to additionally install 5.1.2. and use when needed for certain Macro tasks.\r\n\r\nIs
  it just a matter of installing in a new location, or will it still overwrite some
  of the source and preference files regardless? Or can it be installed to an external
  drive and launched from there?"

  body: "I think that the easiest way to do this is to compress the current installed
    version in your Applications folder and then install the other version before
    expanding (unzipping) the existing one. I think this should allow you to run both
    at once. It looks like this is the recommendation made in the guidelines posted
    by Adam Twardoch here:\r\n\r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=8561.0"

  body: "We <strong>believe</strong> that FontLab Studio 5.1.3 Public Preview build
    4692 is better than any previous version of FontLab Studio 5.x for Mac, but we
    cannot yet <strong>confirm and guarantee</strong> it. This is why the build has
    the \"beta status\". The officially released, confirmed to be stable at the point
    of its release, is version 5.1.2 build 4447. \r\n\r\nBetween build 4447 and 4692,
    we released a number of intermediate builds in which, unfortunately, as it turned
    out, some things got fixed yet others got broken. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we believe
    that we have fixed <strong>all</strong> the things that got broken after build
    4447 \u2014 and that\u2019s build 4692. It includes all the \"good fixes\" after
    4447, as well as all the \"fixes of the things that got broken\". \r\n\r\n(In
    addition, I can say that we have taken some organizational steps that we believe
    will prevent such things from happening again.) \r\n\r\nSo far, the feedback on
    build 4692 has been very good. We at FontLab would really like to thank all the
    people who have submitted their problem reports and participated in the discussions
    on our forum over the course of the last 15 months. \r\n\r\nWe've come a long
    way since build 4204, our developers fixed over 500 problems, and \u2014 again
    \u2014 we believe that build 4692 already is the most stable FontLab Studio ever
    to exist on Mac OS X. \r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "> whatever happened to DTL Kernmaster 2012\r\n\r\nAll I can say is that I
    sympathize with our colleagues at DTL and URW++. We at FontLab know that developing
    complex software applications is hard work, and we've learned it the hard way
    \u2014 especially recently. Despite the fact that we've had the largest team of
    developers and internal QA testers ever \u2014 it took us more than two years
    of full-speed work to move from FontLab Studio 5.0.4 to the current public preview
    build of 5.1.3. \r\n\r\nSo I keep my fingers crossed for the new version of DTL
    KernMaster! \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
