  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been wondering about how a font rental system could work nowadays.
Here&rsquo;s how i see things. i&rsquo;m curious to have your feeback.</p>
<p>1/INSTALL
You install the free font software, let&rsquo;s say something like fontexplorer or font agent pro.</p>
<p>2/REGISTER
You create an account to access the online library.</p>
<p>3/CHOOSE FONTS
You choose your rental options.
Which foundries do you want to have access to.
Which packages.
How many months (weeks?) do you want to subscribe.
Of course according to the packages chosen and so on,
the price would change.</p>
<p>4/ ALL SET
I&rsquo;m ready to go with quite a few fonts for a start.
Besides i&rsquo;m legal.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-this-work">How would this work?</h2>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re connected to the internet you can use the fonts on your system, as if they were locally installed.
Once you&rsquo;re offline, the fonts are considered deactivated and you cannot use them anymore.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-that-system">What are the advantages of that system?</h2>
<h2 id="1-promote-typography--less-piracy">1/ Promote typography / Less piracy</h2>
<p>a/
This solves the problem of paying something before being sure you can use it.
Thus encouraging new typographic experiment and variety.</p>
<p>b/
Young designers will have equal chances with bigger companies with bigger budgets and bigger fonts libraries.</p>
<p>c/
You can still buy the full set if you want to work offline and use them on a regular basis
(in the end it remains the most convenient option).</p>
<p>d/
Some people have never paid and will never pay for their fonts,
but i guess that a starting fee of 15$ (or 12€) with access to a decent library would make people think twice.</p>
<p>e/
Fair sharing of the font for the people involved in the workflow.</p>
<p>For example :
I&rsquo;m working on a website.
We make an introduction video with the font.
The site is partly in flash and we use the font in it.
We&rsquo;ll send flyers and documents using the font too.</p>
<p>So who has to pay for it?
I guess it&rsquo;s unfair to make the flasher pay (but it&rsquo;s illegal not to pay for the font in most cases as far as i know)
Same for the video guy. Well for the print we can still make PDF, but in some cases the print guys does the last minute text corrections&hellip;
so it can happen that this guy needs the font as well.</p>
<p>Some kind of approval system with a time limit could ease everyone&rsquo;s task.</p>
<p>Like that :
i&rsquo;ve got the rental agreement for a font package.
With that i have a code that i can give up to five people so they can access the font to work with.
Once the job is done, you clear them of your list and they cannot access the fonts anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m done, i guess you got the picture.
In an ideal world, this application would only take a few month to become real.
Everything that we need is already here. What do you think?
Anybody interested in making this happen?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’ve spent a great deal of time thinking about systems like this, and they aren’t workable.</p>
<p>First, how does one handle sending the font to the printer? You can’t just convert everything to outlines. But if the user can just send a font to the printer, the user can just keep the font and use it over and over. Sending a PDF doesn’t work for everything.</p>
<p>Second, this is a DRM-based system. It has to be, otherwise nobody even needs to use torrent sites to get complete foundry collections, they just need to get the crack for the rental system. But end-users hate DRM systems, and a system this heavyhanded will irritate the hell out of people.</p>
<p>And what you’re suggesting is DRM that works with all software across platforms. To make the DRM system work across apps software and/or the OS will need to play along. Adobe, small software developers, and open-source developers don’t want font DRM. Microsoft loves DRM, but will inevitably screw it up or try to turn it into a monetized standard. The DRM issue is a disaster all around.</p>
<p>The best option along these lines is an honor-system that allows users to buy single-use licenses. That’s not going to happen because font designers have already learned that about half the graphic designers in the USA are font pirates, and the number is much higher in developing nations. So designers have no reason to assume that the users are really trustworthy.</p>

<p>No, fonts are stored on the internet.
You can still buy them though.
Yes it&rsquo;s really interesting for young designers, there are a lot of them coming on the market every year and they are more prone to have &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; fonts from their university.</p>
<h2 id="james-">James :</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t send the font to the printer.
You give him a code that allows him to access &ldquo;the specific fonts&rdquo; on your account for a limited amount of time.
(that amount of fonts &ldquo;shared&rdquo; can be capped).</p>
<p>Concerning the crack for the system, well you would need to access a distant server and hack it. As tough as going to any foundry website and steal their fonts&hellip;</p>
<p>There are NO DRM, it&rsquo;s an application, like fontexplorer or fontagent.
Instead of activating fonts on your local disk, imagine you have a disk on the internet and you can remotly activate your fonts, but you CAN&rsquo;T DOWNLOAD them (unless you pay the full price). Same as listening to colleagues library with itunes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s REALLY SIMPLE in the way it works.</p>

<p>No, I just need to rent the fonts that I want and extract them from memory while the local client app is running. Now I get to use them over and over for the price of a rental.</p>
<p><cite>you can remotly activate your fonts, but you CAN’T DOWNLOAD them (unless you pay the full price).</cite></p>
<p>The fonts have to be downloaded to RAM to use them locally. And if the application prevents me from saving them, it has a DRM system. To keep me from extracting them from memory to my hard disk, it will need to encrypt them in memory and only make them accessible to applications with a plugin that can decrypt them.</p>

<p>And that’s what makes it so simple to abuse.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>just briefly looking over the outline of it here&rsquo;s what I think:</p>
<p>For you to be able to use the fonts at all, at any point, they ahve to first be downloaded to the computer.  Even if they are stored offline they are still streamed to your computer as you need them (which would also require constant internet connection or you don&rsquo;t have access to the fonts you are renting for a limited time).  Now that these fonts exist in your RAM or on your hard drive somewhere, there would have to be some way of preventing the user from accessing this cache and extracting the font files.  Sure you could store them encrypted, or you would convert them to some proprietary format, but in the end if you can take a font file and transform it into this, somebody can take it and transform it back into a font.</p>
<p>You would need to do this on a system that is so limited that the end-user has literally no access to anything beyond their surface level applications, and as limited and powerless as Windows is, even it isn&rsquo;t that limited.  For what you are proposing to work, you&rsquo;d need an awful lot more than a Font rental service.</p>

<h2 id="for-printers-">For printers :</h2>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated. So far there&rsquo;s no perfect solution.
I guess it&rsquo;s still better than sending the font as is to the printer.</p>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s assume you have datas encrypted in the memory and that it&rsquo;s called DRM in the present case. Why would it be a problem for foundries to have a Digital Right Management System for font rental?</p>
<h2 id="innovati-">Innovati :</h2>
<p>I did not say it would be easy &ldquo;in the making&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s just the process that is simple.
Now the very reason why i&rsquo;m posting this here is to see how it could be done.
Are you 100% positive about the fact that even with protected datas in the memory you could easily hack the font?</p>
<p>Besides you can make mandatory updates in case some security keys would be broken or something like that.</p>
<p>i know my skills in term of computer engineering are quite limited (not to say close to 0), i&rsquo;m just asking questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All right. Let&rsquo;s take into consideration such kind of system.</p>
<p>First, support of major OS&rsquo;es. In Windows XP it can be somehow done, but it requires a decryption mechanism for using them locally. Encryption adds one more API level of abstraction, which leads us to&hellip; well, a whole new heap of versions of any graphics software. Because if decryption is done on OS level, it is obvously bypassable. And if it has to be done in specific applications, they need to be rewritten to take this level of abstraction into account.</p>
<p>Note that for Vista such scenario (like injecting plugins for such encrypted fonts) is next to impossible, at least without Microsoft incorporating this technique in WPF. Otherwise, the user will be haunted by UAC messages everytime he tries to use such fonts. Or the users need to deactivate UAC (not always possible), or use graphics software with Administrator privileges. Too many problems to sort out, with too few real advantages to justify the effort.</p>
<p>About Mac I have serious doubts this can be done without OS integration, which even if Apple agrees to add, leads us to a serious problem: what should the users with outdated OSes do? Upgrade or get lost? I am by no means a Mac OS X programmer, but still have doubts such changes in OS architecture are justified.</p>
<p>And last but not least, Linux (for the sake of GIMP and Scribus users). OS integration is possible, but reversable (open source, anyone?). Same goes for app-specific modules; if the app is opensource, it is reversable, and if it is not, users are forced to use specific proprietary software, which somehow defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>To put the long story short: such DRM systems are hard to implement system-wide, and most users simply refuse to use them, avoiding the manufacturer altogether. The most obvious example is Chuck Davis&rsquo;s Letterhead DRM implementation, which forced most users not to use his typefaces. If not extremely shortsighted, I do not expect any foundry to pay big bucks to develop a rental system, which brings less income than the present sales system, and drives the users away.</p>
<p>Just my 2¢.</p>

<p>It might sounds complicated to you, alright, no problem.
You could also share your point of view to its full extent, we might learn something valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked a couple of developpers as well, they told me the same things James Puckett did with even further details (and in a nicer way ;)).

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, here&rsquo;s an idea (just to explore more &lsquo;what-ifs&rsquo; type of things&hellip;)</p>
<p>IMHO, I can see a designer wanting to rent typefaces more for one-off title/logo development more-so than typesetting a novel. If I&rsquo;m doing the latter, I probably want to own a fully licensed full family of the face I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>But once in a while you get the &lsquo;I need a quick banner ad for my site that advertises a valentine&rsquo;s day sale&rsquo; and you think about how it&rsquo;d be great to use that one particular script face with the hearts for dots over the I&rsquo;s but given the budget is $25 and it needs to be done in 15 minutes, perhaps not so ideal&hellip;</p>
<p>And, uh, I guess I realized I&rsquo;m now thinking the same thing as the above-mentioned &lsquo;online typesetter&rsquo;. It&rsquo;d be slick to either pay a monthly fee or a per-use token fee to be able to log in, type up to x characters or so, and have it spit out an eps for you.</p>
<p>Could someone pay enough to get an eps of each and ever character of the entire library and then import them all back into a font app to regenerate a pirated version? Sure&hellip;but they can find the font easy enough without going through those hoops.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Well i would say this “to have a second better idea, you need a first idea at least to move on to the second.”</em></p>
<p>Okay, sounds promising.</p>
<p><em>So first i wanted to know if it could at least be done before trying to think about it further.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think font rental can be practical, or a practical business proposition, and is not even worth contemplating.</p>
<p><em>It might sounds complicated to you, alright, no problem.
You could also share your point of view to its full extent, we might learn something valuable.</em></p>
<p>Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t spare the time it would take to explain it all. I&rsquo;m busy making fonts. And there&rsquo;s a plentiful supply of typophilers here who do seem to have more time to spare than me and can explain the problems font rental entails. So. . . I leave you with them.</p>
<p><em>At the same time in such a small somebody else certainly had a similar idea before me. If it hasn’t be done yet that might be for a reason.</em></p>
<p>Yep, I understand what you&rsquo;re saying, but I don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re telling me. I&rsquo;m just too busy for this and I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t help you with it, but I wish you all the best regardless.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s another approach that I&rsquo;ve thought about from time to time and wondered if it might work:</p>
<p>This is based on the idea of the way that the old type houses used to work in the days before computers were everywhere. In those day, if you needed some display type for magazine titles, book headings, advertisements, etc., you would send a type house a list of the text you needed with specs for the font and font size; the type house would set the desired text and proof it; and then deliver the proofs to you to cut apart and paste onto the final artwork for your project. (If you needed to adjust the letterspacing/kerning of the type, you cut the individual letters apart and letterspaced them yourself.)</p>
<p>The updated version of this would work something like this: An online typesetting company is set up &ndash; let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;NewTypeHouse&rdquo;. They buy a LOT of display fonts (not cheap, but doable for a business). I e-mail NewTypeHouse with the display text I need along with the specs for it. They copy and paste the text into their in-house typesetting program, and then convert it into outlines and save it as an Illustrator file. Then they e-mail me the file and charge my account. I open the file in Illustrator, adjust it further, if needed, to meet my needs, and then insert the outlines into my project.</p>
<p>I claim no expertise in the legal side of these things, but my understanding is that once NewTypeHouse converts the type to outlines, it ceases to exist as type, and the company would be no longer bound by the typeface license. Likewise, my understanding is that one could not use the outline art received from NewTypeHouse to reconstitute the typeface (except perhaps by cutting and pasting individual letters into FontLab, which would be so much work that I doubt that it would be considered worth the effort by the type buyer.) But perhaps I am wrong about this. I would be interested in others’ thoughts about this approach.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Please keep in mind that all fonts (except custom work) infact already ARE in a kind of rental way. They would be so much more expensive if they were not. So in practic we already have this kind of rental-system for fonts.</p>
<p>And, sorry for saying this, but fonts are really cheap if you compare with other similar things such as photos, copywriting hours, graphic design hours, printing etc. Especially when they also often have some kind of &ldquo;main character&rdquo; role in the whole production.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Renting fonts? sounds great however I cannot see this ever happening.  How about saving up the dough and buying a few good font&rsquo;s.  You don&rsquo;t need to have every font you can think of , just a few after all in the real world one only uses a selected few.</div>
