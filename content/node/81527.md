  body: "Basic disposition is fine, font choice works okay (Univers?) except I'd avoid
    using the ultracondensed type at the smaller size, it's a touch distracting and
    hard to read.\r\n\r\nLeading is awfully uneven, especially in the middle section,
    which creates a rather disrupted rhytm. Same thing when it comes to horizontal
    alignment - especially the top set of words seem aligned neither to the left or
    to the right properly. Trust your eye!\r\n\r\nWhy a single extended line of the
    type at the beginning of \"is graduating from\"? Makes it look like an emergency
    solution, glaringly.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a sometime headline writer, I think you're
    way off when it comes to word emphasis in the middle section. The keywords are
    \"Graduating\" and \"Bachelor's Degree\" (those are the words a hypothetical newscaster
    reading this out would emphasise), whereas the varying size makes \"California
    State\" and \"in kineseology\" seem like the most important words instead. Try
    reading it out loud, especially emphasising the type that's bigger, and you'll
    see how silly it sounds."

  body: "This is quite nice.\r\n\r\nKinesiology is misspelt. I'm not sure about the
    squooshed text on the first and last lines of that section. Maybe you can letterspace
    instead. Linespacing in that block needs to be evened out. Is there a way to move
    the text so the join on the beckground is not behind the last letter of each line?"

    font, i feel looks better than the 2nd image. but it is true that its difficult
    to read. But i like how it created a dark solid shape. the 2nd image, the info
    section looks very light.\r\nhmm..."

  body: "Personally I'd align the name the same way as the block below it, either
    by resizing the type or adding letterspace, so the right side is all aligned.\r\n\r\nThere's
    something funny with the alignment and leading of the bottom section. And wouldn't
    a date be helpful?"

    seat and center line perfectly horizontal and vertical. This is only necessary
    if you are as obsessive-compulsive as I am!\r\n\r\nhttp://help.adobe.com/en_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSF65FB40F-00F5-445a-BD9A-38B3737A9A19a.html\r\n\r\nspecifically
    the Straighten tool, and possibly Horizontal and Vertical Perspective, and Remove
    Distortion.\r\n\r\nAfter using those tools you will have to crop the image a bit
    to remove the transparent areas created at the edges of the picture.\r\n\r\nAnd
    congratulations!"

  body: "I agree with Mugford, the photo alignment (slight rotation) bugs me. \r\n\r\nNothing
    wrong with a photo being at an angle sometimes, but if it's only a tiny bit off
    then it can look like a mistake. Either make it straight or else at a definite
    angle so it looks deliberate."

  body: "Count me in as well. Image is just enough off that it looks as an error than
    a feature. Correct it in either way.\r\n\r\nThe last font treatment seems fine
    except that it's still not fine on the left. I suspect it should be lined up (visually
    of course). Hence /1/ sticks out. Other lines will look aligned when /1/ is aligned
    with them as well.\r\n\r\nHave you taken the photo? Wouldn't it be nice if she
    had a plate on her lap with and holding a fork in her arm putting it under some
    angle to give it a bit more dynamic feel? Or just eating off the fork...\r\n\r\nAnd
    of course congrats to Aileen. :)"

    a bit of space. The name block is begging to be fully justified and the wider
    ''I'' may make Aileen wide enough to align with the other two names. '
