  swoosh face; half of me thinks the C is from a different face to the rest so I've
  been delving into fonts I have with ornaments and swooshes, got sidetracked by Poetica
  [again], and have ended up here via the usual online ID tools.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6140.gif]\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\n\r\ns"

    The OpenType version comes in one font with the swash ''C'' built in (scroll down).'

  body: I'm sure he's quite happily living off Verdana's royalties unless he signed
    his soul away to Microsoft without any further help from me required.

  body: Not sure what Verdana and Georgia bring him, but most likely he earns the
    bulk of his income from custom designs, not retail sales.
