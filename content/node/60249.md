  between the Louvre and Sacre Coeur we stumbled on to the <strong>[[http://www.galerieslafayette.com|Galeries
  Lafayette]]</strong>, a giant unbelievably luxurious french department store. I
  was shocked to see the place was just dripping with the font Ashby that I designed
  several years ago. It was used on just about every sign and banner and display in
  the place.\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://www.woodardworks.com/type02b.html|Ashby]]</strong>
  is the second font I ever created. When I couldn't get anybody to distribute it,
  I let it go free. With no EULA or anything -- like a big dummy.\r\n\r\nEven though
  I'm the designer, I had never really seen it in use so much. It does look pretty
  good for the most part. But I see now it has a lot of silly errors. When I was working
  on it, I was obsessing on making the whole thing completely evenly weighted and
  I really could have used better judgement that I didn't possess at the time. Even
  the accents are the same stroke weight as the glyphs and that looks pretty funky
  especially when set in French.\r\n\r\nThe Galeries seem to be a serious business
  so I am surprised to see them using a free font off the web so heavily. But If they
  are going to use it like that, I would love to work out a pro version of Ashby for
  them that looks a little more professional. And maybe not quite so free.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas on how to get hold of their art department? And somebody who hopefully speaks
  english??"
