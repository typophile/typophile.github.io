body: "Hello, I am in the middle of designing my first font and have a little stumbling
  block in terms of the metrics measurements.\r\n\r\nI have managed to insert the
  'correct' values for most glyphs but I am unsure of what to do with accents such
  as circumflex, tilde, breve, cedilla, caron etc. I created these with their corresponding
  letterfoms initially and so Fontlab autofilled these spaces hence leaving the metrics
  values rather large. I am unsure of whether to leave them large as is the case with
  other fonts I have studied or manually assign some values to them? Hope I make sense?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help offered..."

  body: I center the marks on an en (500 units), as do many other designers. But I
    also see them centered on common widths that vary from font to font, and in some
    cases, with variable widths. So maybe some of the more experienced designers can
    explain a little more.

  body: "Far as I'm concerned, you're on the wrong track. You need to know the difference
    between SPACING MODIFIERS and COMBINING DIACRITICALS. These are different characters
    in Unicode, even if they are the same glyph. OpenType presupposes Unicode.\r\n\r\nJust
    remember that as far as Unicode was concerned, having a codepoint for any accented
    character was an unfortunate circumstance, done for legacy purposes only. Some
    people are beginning to prepare texts as Unicode intended, even when a legacy
    character is available in most fonts -- such as aacute.\r\n\r\nSo your first job
    is to not muck up the proper spacing of the characters. Your second job is to
    make up whatever precomposed accented characters you want, without buggering up
    that proper spacing."

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am not sure I follow. I have attached a photo of my typeface
    to show you what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe character on the left (including an accent)
    has been spaced correctly. ie. the side bearing measurements are correct. The
    accent on the right (on its own) is the one in question. How do I work out the
    side bearing values to give all single accents? (Like cedilla, ogonek, circumflex,
    breve etc.)?"

  body: "A combining diacritical \r\n\r\nhttp://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf \r\n\r\nshould
    have zero width. You can locate that accent anywhere (with a plus or minus sidebearing
    value), but the character needs to have zero width. \r\n\r\nSpacing modifier characters
    \r\n\r\nhttp://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U02B0.pdf\r\n\r\nshould have their natural
    width, so they appear right when used in a word -- an example, not from the list
    of \"accents,\" is the \"raised comma,\" as is sometimes used for a romanized
    hamza, which is properly U+02BD, not an \"apostrophe,\" U+2019. The two different
    characters will likely need a slightly different width, and different kerning.\r\n\r\nSame
    with different uses of \"accent\" characters, such as the \"acute.\" As I said,
    you will find the same glyph in several places, but they are different characters,
    and need to be spaced for that character's proper use.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe you are
    asking about \"what's the best width so I don't have to do as much work?\" But
    how much work you have to do to get the accent right on precomposed characters
    is your problem (i.e., the type designer's problem). Not a proper excuse for mucking
    up the character's widths.\r\n\r\n"

  body: For my typeface, I centered the combining diacritics based on the metrics
    for the /o/ or the /O/ depending on whether they were for caps or lower case.
    For the rest of the diacritics, I used the same size as I did for the tabular
    figures.
