  to your email when someone replies to a thread you've posted.\r\nOr is it possible
  to subscribe to a thread you've made a comment on, and a notification to your email
  ?\r\n\r\nI've never known a forum that doesn't have that option."

    it was old-fashioned; it was legally dangerous in terms of libel lawsuits.\r\n\r\nThere
    is that RSS thing though. Or try this way: http://typophile.com/tracker/45717\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    often forget that I've posted something, and in this electronic age, there is
    nothing worse than waiting for an answer, or a reply, rather than getting on with
    work, and being told exactly when \"Somebody has responded\"."

  body: "@djnippa, I hear you on waiting for an answer. I thought I was also missing
    the obvious, but never found the right options in my profile or settings to activate
    notifications. Notifications would be considered the easiest way to be updated
    on a thread. At least, and it would still be an archaic structure, having a \"subscribe
    to this thread\" option to be notified in a dashboard of sorts upon login. \r\n\r\nEver
    since the [NEW] Font ID forum started, they don't appear in \"My Posts\" either.
    The last one showing is from a year and half ago. At any rate, I hope there'll
    eventually be a way to receive notifications at some point. "
