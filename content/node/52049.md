  I came with one doubt that I want to ask:\r\nDo you know any good text/article about
  the distance between accents above the letter?\r\nMy point is this: I have differents
  accents in my typeface for languages that I don't know and would love to have some
  knowledge on that and some feedback from native speakers...\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAnt\xF3nio

    In your face, vary the separation between letter and accent, and also try compressing
    the height of the taller capital accents. '
