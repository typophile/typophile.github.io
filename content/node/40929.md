body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nHow do I choose (or calculate) the font size i use
  in a publication, and all the bigger and smaller sizes that will be used in it?
  and how to calculate the baseline grid (70% of font size space between the lines
  is that right?)\r\n\r\ni understand the page size, how many columns and all elements
  connect to each other in this calculation, how do i start? are there any equations
  available on the internet that i could use?\r\n\r\nthis is in the process of redesigning
  a magazine, which already have the page size and the font type (but even font will
  be changed later) or should the font be changed first and then start calculating
  the sizes?\r\n\r\nthanks alot,\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey b, I'm from the school that chooses the text font and size first. This
    is usually between 8.5 and 11 or so points, depending on how the typeface relates
    to the em (not a big deal), the overall density of the text face you choose, and
    the age and/or reading abilities of the perceived audience and your column width.
    The last three are the bigger issues. There are a lot of other ways, but usually
    a mag in redesign know what the logo and the text look like as they fill in between.
    \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    doesn't really work that way. This is design, not engineering, and as a result
    the answer to most questions is a qualitative \"what looks good\" rather than
    something quantitative."

  body: "Printing out a series of samples placed in columns works well. I would also
    do some research looking at different magazines and find ones that have a size
    that you like. Bring a ruler measure in mm for a more exact measurement or a pica
    ruler and then convert to points. you can download a demo application called the
    Art Directors Toolkit it is an amazing time saver, it also does grid calculations
    and more. check it out here: http://www.code-line.com/software/artdirectorstoolkit.html\r\nI
    would not go any smaller than 7.5pt sans serif face or 8pt serif, it is all about
    legibility and aesthetics in the end."
