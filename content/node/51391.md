body: "My desire to alphabetize and color-code everything extends into my font organization.
  The problem is, I don't know what to do with those font sets I purchase that have
  several fonts (e.g. Font Diner's \"Casino Buffet\", House Industries \"House-a-Rama\").
  I also have many of my fonts in three places: in an A-Z folder, in a folder organized
  by foundry, and organized by client. When I'm working on a particular client's job
  I want to drag all their fonts into my manager of choice (FontExplorer X), but it
  activates all TT and PS fonts (not one or the other) and it becomes quite a jumbled
  mess.\r\n\r\nClearly, this isn't working for me!\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if any of
  you have found a way to organize your fonts on your hard drive that keeps things
  nice and tidy. Or please feel free to advise me if you think I'm wasting my time
  with such pursuits. I'm pretty old school; this has been my thought process since
  1991. I'm willing to let it go if there's a more modern way of doing this.\r\n\r\nTIA-\r\nK."

  body: "I've been dealing with the issue lately also. Here are a couple thoughts.
    \r\n\r\nI keep only one copy of the fonts organized by foundry\u2014that way,
    I don't end up with conflicts or accidentally deleting my only copy because I
    thought I had a duplicate somewhere else. (plus it helps me remember who designed
    what). In FontExplorer each font can have comments assigned to it. In the comments
    I'll use adjectives that describe the history, the style, the mood, etc. or add
    one pertaining to a client. I then create smart sets that use those key words.
    So if I'm looking for a bold, feminine, sans serif. I can quickly create a set
    that gets me where I need without endlessly sorting through folders and lists."

    FontXplorer X(Each individual foundry is a collection in my FontXplorer X). I
    tend to use the Foundry websites a lot to browse through the faces and decide
    which to use/buy. This has been working very well for me as I am somewhat OCD
    when it comes to keeping my machine/workspace organized. '

  body: "I'd love to expand on Jeremiah's idea a little.\r\n\r\nI imagine you have
    a nice music collection, and you may have thousands of songs, from hundreds of
    albums, from dozens of bands, but there's a clear and easy way to organize them.\r\n\r\nInstead
    of trying to sort your music by style or tempo or key signature, sort them by
    who makes them, much like iTunes does.\r\n\r\nThink of your fonts as songs, your
    font families as albums and the foundry as the artist.  I think it's a really
    simple idea and I find it works well!\r\n\r\nJust as in iTunes, instead of letting
    single entries clutter it up, I have a catch-all generic artist that I put all
    of the loose ends in.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're on a mac and don't already have professional
    font-management software, there's a free tool (sorry mac-only at the moment, windows
    port is in the works) offered by Linotype called <a hre=\"http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX\">FontExplorer
    X</a>.  It has an interface similar to iTunes and I've found it very useful.\r\n\r\nAnother
    cool feature of this, is that it allows you to enable or disable selections of
    fonts, so you could easily create a 'playlist' of all the fonts used for specific
    projects and also manage them that way too!"

    Unlike most of the typophiles here I don't organize by foundry (except rare exceptions
    like Emigre and House Industries) because that's not how I think of fonts. I don't
    sit down and say... hmm for this project I'd like to use something by Matthew
    Carter. So I have sets based more on the attributes than who designed or sold
    the font. My sets are \r\nantique/distressed\r\ncalligraphic/uncial\r\ncheck these
    out (new fonts I want to use)\r\ncondensed\r\ndeco\r\ndingbats\r\ndisplay/ornate\r\nemigre\r\nexpert

  body: I keep my fonts organized by foundry in alphabetic order. Someday I'd like
    to add tags using descriptions, as Patty has done, and use smart folders too.
    But for not foundry helps me out the most because in my head it also separates
    them by EULA and quality. :^)

  body: "Sharon - I used to make sets for each project but FontExplorer (when it's
    working properly which mine is not right now) activates the fonts for you. I still
    sometimes make a set right at the beginning when I'm still testing out the fonts.\r\n\r\nOrganizing
    by Foundry would be useless for me. It's so not the way I approach design. The
    old Font Reserve had foundry info as part of the interface, I'm surprised FontExplorer
    doesn't do that. It doesn't seem to let you add or customize it either."

    common thing that corrupts fonts is when a program crashes while the font is activated.\r\n\r\nBy
    having two libraries I never activate the master font (and I don't like FontExplorer
