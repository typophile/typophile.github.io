  site (I didn't create it, I just maintain it). Now on my new computer, I'm editing
  and getting the \"font not available\" message--but I have no idea what either of
  these fonts is. I do know that the title font (\"Sampling\") has an Alien effect
  on it. Anyone know what either font is, or both?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nStevie[img:sites/default/files/old-images/home2_6036.jpg]"
