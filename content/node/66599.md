  and came across these two lovely typefaces. I thought they were great. I'd like
  to buy them/download them if possible for my own uses and I was hoping someone out
  there could help me identify them. Much thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

    Allgemeine Zeitung\xAB (FAZ). You might browse Dieter Steffmann\u2019s [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm|collection]]
    for a start. For the headlines within the paper, FAZ employed a special version
    of Fette Gotisch called \xBBFAZ Fraktur\xAB made by [[http://www.urwpp.de/deutsch/home.html|URW]],
    which unfortunately is not used anymore since about two years. "

    the Aftenposten font could be?

    custom designed. \r\nI browsed through various blackletter specimen, but couldn\u2019t
    find anything similar. The round e is pretty special, and so is the A."
