  body: Can't find a perfect match. To me, it's either a freebie or a custom job based
    on freebie (/n width unbalanced and /g tail connection really awkward) but I my
    be wrong. For what it's worth, if I have to recreate it, I'd probably start with
    [[http://www.dafont.com/caviar-dreams.font|Caviar Dreams]], doubling /v to create
    /w and grabbing regular /e from [[http://www.dafont.com/champagne-limousines.font|Champagne
    & Limousines]].
