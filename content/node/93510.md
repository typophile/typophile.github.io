body: "Hello experts on the field\r\n\r\nI created a font that has 2 variations of
  the capital letters and 3 variations of the lower cases. It is a serif font traced
  from a popular children's book from the end of the 19th century so it was done by
  hand. I consulted the 2006 post by steff_en and got some answers. \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/17887#comment-511377\r\n\r\nI
  set my classes and followed twardoch instructions and I got no errors, I generated
  the font but it does not do what I intended. That is: everytime I type a particular
  letter for the second or third time I want them different. As I mentioned, I made
  3 versions of every small cap letters and 2 versions of the capital letters.\LEx:
  in the word \"tomorrow\", I would like the three \"o\"s and the two \"r\"s to be
  diferent in the same word.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_4059.jpg]"

    seems the simplest to me, for I can barely program. \r\n\r\nfeature salt {\r\nlookup

    QUESTION IS THIS:\r\nShould I rename my classes to set_1, set_2 and set_3 to make
    this coding work??? You can see the image that contains my classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes the swash is a feature on its own. I will give it a shot and let you know.
    THANX!

  body: "Hmm. Assuming the swashes is a feature on its own, your code would look like
    this:\r\n\r\nfeature salt {\r\nlookup rotate {\r\nsub @class1 @class1' by @alt1;\r\nsub
    @alt1 @class1' by @alt2;\r\nsub @alt2 @class1' by @class1;\r\n} rotate;\r\nlookup

    the example above, each class has four elements. I can now call the classes in

    the @lc class, remember) will be subsituted for the glyph occupying the same \u201Cslot\u201D
    in the @smcp class. In this case /d.smcp/. If the @smcp class only has three letters
    there\u2019s no way for the OT engine to know what to do.\r\n"

  body: "The bottom of the Classes panel shows the total number of glyphs in the selected
    class (110 in your screenshot). In order to substitute a class by another class,
    each class must contain the same number of glyphs, sorted in the same order relative
    to the other. If <code>@class1</code> contains 110 glyphs <code>[A B C ...]</code>,
    then <code>@alt1</code> must contain 110 alternates <code>[A.alt1 B.alt1 C.alt1
    ...]</code>, and <code>@alt2</code> as well <code>[A.alt2 B.alt2 C.alt2 ...]</code>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I
    created a font that has 2 variations of the capital letters and 3 variations of
    the lower cases.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis could be the source of the problem.
    If <code>@alt2</code> contains only lowercase alternates, it can't be substituted
    for a class that also contains capitals. A solution would be to separate up the
    upper- and lowercase glyphs into different sets of classes (with related classes
    containing the same number of glyphs), and \"rotate\" each set independently.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    see [[http://typophile.com/node/19625#comment-269297|Miguel Sousa's explanation]]
    of the code, including why certain parts may be unnecessary. Even after separating
    by case, the whole thing should work with only one rule for the uppercase and
    two for the lowercase.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsub @uppercase @uppercase' by @uppercase_alt1;\r\nsub
