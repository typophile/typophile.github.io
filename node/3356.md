  body: When I posted the digital version of the font it kept having server errors.
    It did not tell me it was posting; only that there was an internal server error.
    That explains all the posts with &#34;error.&#34; Sorry about that.

  body: On the forum it must look like people are eating this typeface up. However,
    it&#39;s only a mistake, turned into a sad self-promoting debacle.

  body: Here is a final digital version of the typeface. I made it monospaced for
    a modular application. Let me know what you think.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27752.jpg"

  body: It evoques me a tech and doom world trainyard. Comments the parentesis are
    too short and the stem of the &#34;I&#34; is very weak, move the thin parts to
    the arms. <BR> <BR>Oh, and by the way, congratulations for your new typophile
    error post record.

  body: Thanks Tiffany. It was quite the ride.  <BR> <BR>Hector, thanks for your comments.
    The &#34;I&#34; has been causing me lots of poblems. The problem with putting
    a heavier stem is that the letter looks a lot heavier and darker than the rest.
    I do agree with you though. It&#39;s a letter I&#39;m going to keep working on.

  body: After a careful look in the fine detail of this font, one can only imagine
    how much time and research went into understanding train yards. This is truly
    a great font. May the train community embrace it and hold it close to their hearts.  <BR>
