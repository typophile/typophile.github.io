  typography magazines, books, TDC annuals, graphic design books of all kinds including
  vintage and first editions. \r\nAlso two full sets of the original OCTAVO magazines.\r\nWould
  appreciate suggestions on the best way to do this. \r\nI know this is not the place!\r\nBut
  hope to see the books to go to a designer or organization that will appreciate them.\r\nThanks
  for any info.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nMara Kurtz\r\n"
