body: "Hello,\r\nI'm currently working on a revamp of a Chicago-based art advisor's
  logo, and what is to be kept is this 4-letter stack of letters which are set in
  Avenir Medium.  I don't recall off-hand any instances of a serif font working well
  as a secondary typeface to a dominant medium-weight sans (the only ones I could
  imagine to recall appear in my mind to be very German) so am looking for some ideas.
  \ Any ideas are appreciated as I'm stuck in a mind-loop wanting to just use Avenir.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDC"

  body: Thanks for the suggestion.  I should also add that I'm aiming to have a more
    feminine feel to this, and it seems that if I go in a direction of using a serif
    it might need to be light or subtle.
