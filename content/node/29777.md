  am back to you with quite an easy question for the ones, who do this. Just look
  over your shoulder: what books do you recommend for those, working on the concept,
  both visual and business, of a magazine?\r\n\r\nTo this moment I have purchased:\r\n\"How
  Now to Start a Magazine\" by B.Ann Bell (already read)\r\n\"Starting and Running
  a Successful Newsletter or Magazine\" by Cheryl Woodard (now reading)\r\n\"Merz
  to Emigre and beyond\" by Steven Heller\r\n\r\nFrom me summer reading I will most
  probably re-read \"The Education of an Art Director\" by Steven Heller. \"Exercises
  in Style\" by Raymond Queneau will probably also be purchased on the nearest occasion.\r\n\r\nBut
  I guess, there are more, which are worth investing in. Or are there?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexey"

    \"Publication Design Workbook,\" both published by Rockport. Timothy Samara wrote
    \"Publication Desing Workbook\" and you seem to be a fan of his work (\"Making
    and Breaking the Grid\" was by him), so maybe that's a good fit.\r\n\r\nYes, I
    browsed your Web site. Very nice. I hope to look around more thoroughly when I'm
    not at work..."

  body: "thanks, hrant. already looking at it.\r\n\r\nsevety7, thanks for the warm
    words. :)\r\nhowever, timothy samara is not my favourite author. that book on
    grids hasn't featured the best layout - my eyes get moist when I try to read that
    light gray text on glossy stock. But I'll still take a look at that book you've
    mentioned; hopefully his style got easier on reader. Thanks!"

    would be that... the type used for the main text is too light and hard to read!
    - which kind of contradicts the subject?\"\r\n\r\n:("

    and content make it worth the purchase IMHO."
