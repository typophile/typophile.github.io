		<div class="commentbody">They were very much set in their ways. The funny thing was that they subscribed to both Print and CA, but they did so because that's what design companies do, not because they were interested in reading the magazines. I knew that place was the wrong fit for me, but I stayed a year because I wanted to give them a fair try. <BR> <BR>Another suggestion I'd have is to do things to keep design fun, even if the stuff you're working on isn't fun.

I worked a weekend of training in spring, but by summer  my dad had helped me get a job at Ampex in the technical publications department. He was an engineer there (ah, nepotism). They did ask me back for a second summer however, so I think I did OK. The unofficial red-shirt-day custom that I mentioned in my first post was started by one of the writers there.</div>
