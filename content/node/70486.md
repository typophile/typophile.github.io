body: "Hello to everyone, i'm a graphic spanish designer. \r\n\r\nRecently I knew
  the judgement of my personal trial with Renault, a famous french car brand, who
  did an spanish and south-american advertising campaign with some caracters with
  a typeface that it was entirely developed by me.\r\n\r\nNow the process is that
  my lawyer, specialist in intelectual property, and me are creating the apellation
  text to try change the judgement (other judge).\r\n\r\nThe judgement says that I
  am the author and Renault have stolen my type but,the judge continued saying there
  is no any personality of me in my design, so I'm not be able to defend my creation
  because is not original. My typeface is inspired by tracks of a car game (ex. Scalextric
  or Superslot) but simplifying some of the details of those track modules. Is the
  first inspired with those tracks in Spain anb was published like that.\r\n\r\nThe
  judge had two writings from the most important association of designers in spain
  where they give the whitnes about my work, as well as the director of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nThat
  typeface was designed and developed for an urban design contest in Barcelona, I
  won the first typeface prize and there it was an exhibition where my typeface was
  one of the things shown. In the displays said perfectly that I was the designer
  and developer of that alphabet/typography, so with this example would be enough
  to consider that I have some rights with it. I wonder how Renault (and its advertising
  agency) accesed directly to my own type file, because the shown in the ad campaign
  had the same details, tracking and kerning.\r\n\r\nNow we would need to receive
  some tricky reasons to defend it in front of this giant firm. I do not how to proceed,
  I would need some help an especialist, specially if you know similar issues where
  the judge finally gave the veredict to the designer part.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\nLuis

    don't understand the statement of the judge that there is not any personality
    of you in your design. Isn't this debatable? I mean, your work wasn't a literal
    translation (a typeface is something totally different than racetracks); theirs
    was. If you can't claim this was your work, then no designer can ever copyright
    anything, because every designer has its inspiration.\r\n\r\nSorry this is just

    was. I have removed the protection in three seconds with the tool \"PDF Password

    seem to be embedded as font, but I think, it would be relatively easy to extract
    the letters.\r\n\r\n"

    before to be writed in that judgement, with an example, the warhol painting of
    the cambells soup.\r\n\r\nHe said something like in that masterpiece you can see
    many personal examples of Warhol paintings (and it is true). Now I will need to
    try to get more and better examples of designs or creations where it's clear that
    the inspiration was other design thing or made them by other creator. Do you have
    better examples?\r\n\r\nI will not reply to the stealing technics about breaking
    a PDF password, it's true that the font is not embeded and the example caracters
    are not the same. It's clear they did\xB4t get the paths from this example. I
    think they got them from a beta file that I sent to the display printers of the
    exibition. But in that case, in the typefile has the text telling that the type
    was copyrighted with an email address. It's clear someone distributed it without
    permission. Doesn\xB4t matter. The guilty is Renault (and its ad agency, but that
    don\xB4t interest me much, the final name was Renault and it's responsible of
    the trouble).\r\n "

  body: "Luis,\r\n\r\nI work directly with judges in Brazilian Judiciary. Unhappily,
    judges have a permanent difficult to understand these less usual issues. And IP
    questions are not usual.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to some lawyers. Even IP specialists
    tend to write in a very 'legal' way and this does not helps the judge to understand
    an issue outside his usual world. If you can, do a final verification in your
    lawyer appeal before he submits it to the second trial. Maybe you can help to
    achieve a more comprehensive text.\r\n\r\nIn many times the case got a deeper
    analysis in second trial and the misundertood decision from first trial is reverted.
    Key to this is to make them understand what is a font design and why a font is
    protected even considering the basic character shapes are known for centuries.\r\n\r\nAnother
    place to search is WIPO/OMPI site. They provide lots of materials about IP and
    most of their orientations apply primarly to Europe.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
