body: "This is how it works:\r\n<ul><li>A portion of a glyph is published in the Type
  ID Pop Quiz.</li>\r\n<li>Try to identify the glyph and the typeface. To win, you
  need to name at least:\r\n<ol><li>typeface</i>\r\n<li>weight</i>\r\n<li>character/glyph</li></ol></li>\r\n<li>Show
  off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it,
  when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your
  fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The winner produces a new challenge -- a portion
  of a glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including
  a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The person who posts a challenge can't
  win the next game.</ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and
  avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is a little too difficult, maybe
  try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31362\">Entry Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a>
  or <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31363\">Intermediary Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a>
  first.\r\n\r\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>With respectful thanks
