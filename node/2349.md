body: Happy Holidays Typophiles. <BR> <BR>Here is the project that has gobbled all
  my spare time of late. First, let me say, <i>this is not a revival</i>. If you are
  looking for a proper revival, Bruce Rogers and Robert Slimbach have done nicely.
  This is me fiddling with Jenson. To be sure it has some venetian overtones, but
  is unapologeticly streamlined, most notably in the joins and serifs. I had a bit
  of fun with the f ligatures. They reference Jenson directly in a way I had not seen
  before, but still &#40;i hope&#41; subtle enough so modern readers don&#39;t hiccup.
  Italics are anybody&#39;s guess. Here, I just started drawing &#40;my first true
  italics&#41;. Some of these will surely need revision. They are not overly narrow
  &#40;a trait I find annoying&#41;. The color between the uppers, lowers, small cap
  and italics is very close. Another Jenson diversion is the short cap height. Numerals
  are straight ahead &#40;more variations to follow&#41; <BR> <BR>Curious to hear
  your reactions. Currently the font is outlines only. I will begin creating the font
  and get you a text setting shortly. <BR> <BR>Cheers! <BR>Randy <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22065.gif"

  body: 'The R did give some trouble. Jenson&#39;s R is rediculous. Sooooooooo wide!
    Nice by itself, or as an alternate ending, but it makes for a huge hole. R came
    first, then the P actually. Do you think the open waist accentuates the issue?
    I debated about this characteristic, and decided to leave it in all the caps &#40;A,B.P,R&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Drawing in Illustrator has advantages. The largest being the ability
    to have uppers, lowers, smallcaps, and italics all in the same document for comparison.
    FontLab and Fontographer both feel like I&#39;m working too isolated. It&#39;s
    not so easy to drop some italics in between the regulars to check color etc. If
    course, it adds the step of having to check over the contours after importing.
    <BR> <BR>Zero: Yeah, now that I look, even ciphers have slight optical compensation.
    <BR> <BR>y: A stonger tail would be better, i agree. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to
    mull over the other suggestions <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy  <BR> <BR>Forgot to
    add: About the dark color. We will have to wait and see how it looks in a text
    setting. I did make it a bit darker on purpose. I think a light version somewhere
    between a &#42;normal&#42; roman and light could also be nice, the that is a daydream
    right now. '

    The &#34;g&#34; in Mendoza looks <i>really</i> small - I think yours just needs

  body: The new R is an improvement, but the bottom left serif looks a bit too heavy.
    <BR> <BR>I used to find R a difficult letter until I read a comment by Gerard
    Unger in his article about Capitolium in <i>Typography Papers</i> &#40;issue 3,
    I think&#41;. He said he tried to make the R look like an orator standing with
    one foot forward. For some reason, this really made sense to me and I&#39;ve found
    R much easier to draw ever since.

  body: Maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m using the wrong terminology. What will probably
    end up happening is there will be a text version &#40;steming from &#42;book&#42;&#41;,
    and a display version &#40;a modified &#42;roman&#42;&#41;. As it stands now,
    it didnt&#39; make sense to call the roman display because i&#39;d need to thin
    out the serifs and generally make it more delicate. I was motivated to do the
    text/book version because when I was printing text samples at smaller sizes 6-11
    pt some of the defining details were fading. The top serifs for example, it wasn&#39;t
    clear that they weren&#39;t the triangular bracketed veriety found in most venetian
    oldstyles, so i deepened the cut. Certain joins needed to be reworked so I added
    trapping, and in some cases &#40;the r, n, m etc&#41; altered the stem &#40;made
    it vertical&#41; as well to open things up. <BR> <BR>The resulting text is crispier.
    And more characteristic of what I wanted. I think the confusion will go away when
    I call them text and display. &#40;And when the display version is a proper display
    version :-&#41; Hope that helped. <BR> <BR>Randy
