body: "There seems to be no font for the Macintosh that can display properly Hebrew
  with cantillation marks, a situation I find annoying since my MacBook Pro with OS
  X 10.5 can't even  display in a useful way some Wiki pages I  consulted recently.
  I thus took the time to build such a font, using python and the python fontforge
  module, starting from the glyphs of Yoram Gnat's Keter YG font.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  first looked for a good corpus of glyph combinations to produce as ligatures, i.e.
  a repertoire of consonants with their accompanying vowels and marks. The Mechon
  Mamre site allows downloading such a Bible [[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0.htm]]
  in a  click and I took those html files as my corpus, giving me a little more than
  6250 combinations that I wanted to precompose using python with the fontforge python
  module.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am no font designer, at all. I thus had to start from an
  existing font that allows modifications, and since the Mechon Mamre files are based
  on the [[http://www.aleppocodex.org/|Aleppo Codex]], of which there is a very nice
  edition I could get from my university library, the [[http://www.jerusalem-crown.co.il/website_en/index.asp|Jerusalem
  Crown]], with a  font made by Zvi Narkiss,  I chose a font with the same inspiration,
  namely Yoram Gnat's Keter YG font (available from [[http://culmus.sourceforge.net/taamim/index.html|Taamey
  Culmus]]). \r\n\r\nWanting to keep the job as simple as possible, I found no other
  way than to discard completely the \"Hebrew logic\" (the Hancock-Hudson layout)
  used in Yoram Gnat's font, that looked much too complicated for me to handle. I
  then  moved a few dots out of the way to avoid as much as possible clashes with
  other diacritics; I used a scheme with only 6 marks, namely 'bottom center',  'bottom
  right',  'top left',  'top center', 'top right' and 'high above'. The idea was simply
  to reconstruct with a fontforge script each of the combinations occurring in the
  Crown using the marks and attachments somewhat as they are normally used dynamically
  in an opentype font;  knowing of no tools to do that, I wrote the code for it, but
  did just the minimum necessary. Another python script generates the mif file and
  it is ftxenhancer that produced the final font.\r\n\r\nHere it is,  Keter YG for
  Macintosh ([[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/macketer.zip|zip file,
  164K]] and here is how [[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c2679.htm]] renders with
  FireFox on my Powerbook.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psalm_4135.png]\r\nSince
  the Mechon Mamre site encodes 'holamhaser for vav' as 'zwj holam', the font also
  accepts that combination though  it is made to use U+05BA; the font is nothing but
  ccmp tables and precomposed combinations.\r\n\r\nIf there is any \"big mistake\"
  please tell me fast. \r\n\r\nMichel"

  body: "The font now handles the furtive patah in all the cases where it occurs in
    the Mechon Mamre site http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0.htm.\r\n\r\nI now need
    to add a word of caution. If you read the .css file associated to the link above,
    you get \r\n<code>\r\nbody {font-family:\"Ezra SIL SR\",\"Ezra SIL\",\"Keter YG\",
    \ ...\r\n</code>\r\nmeaning that if the Ezra fonts are installed, they will be
    used by your browser (and that works well on Windows), else the next is Keter
    YG. The font I made was intended to install on my mac so that \"Keter YG\" would
    be used, and would render correctly in Safari the pages corresponding to the link
    above.\r\n\r\nThe word of caution is that the font is not general purpose.  It
    assumes that the vowel points and marks are typed exactly in the same order as
    they are on the Mechon Mamre site, else, it will not display correctly your text."

  body: "I finally added the code to reorder the diacritics. Assuming the dagesh,
    shindot and sindot follow immediately the consonant, there are at most three diacritics
    to reorder in the files I considered. Two rearrangement tables applied in a row
    do the job: the first selects the diacritic to go first, the second the diacritic
    to go second (that is a selection sort). To sort four, three rearrangement tables
    would be used etc. Being able to rearrange things that way was an advantage of
    the AAT fonts.\r\n\r\nNow, I am afraid this is a farewell. Indeed here is what
    ftxenhancer returns me on OS X 10.7\r\n<code>\r\nLaunch of \"ftxenhancer\" failed:
    the PowerPC architecture is no longer supported.\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe Apple font
    tools no longer work on OS X 10.7. Goodbye.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"

  body: Dear Michel, So for the Error message when running "ftxenhancer" on OS X 10.7,
    does it mean The Apple font tools no longer available in the world? What can we
    use instead of Apple Font Tools?
