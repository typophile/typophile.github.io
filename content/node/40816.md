    ambient light in the room.\r\n\r\nBTW, the reason that 21\" works for me is that
    it's just beyond the threshold of being able to see the vertical lines of the
    screen."

    in January last year I have to contend with a light moire pattern made up of patches
    of light and shade, and linear distortion. Due to those problems the spectacles
    are no longer effective at close range and I often move closer to the screen to
    \"see around\" the distortion, in effect looking at things at magnified resolution.\r\n\r\nElf

  body: About 25". The screen is on a separate part of the desk, which is lower than
    the part the keyboard is on, the bottom of the screen starting ab. 3" from the
    tabletop. The result is that I look slightly down to it, which is good for the
    neck.

  body: "One of the best things I ever did was to get a set of glasses just for working
    on the computer. At around age 50 I got bifocals, and immediately I began to have
    discomfort when working at a computer.\r\n\r\nOne day I was talking with an airlines
    ticket agent [before we made our reservations via computers] and she said \"hold
    on, honey, I'm just back from lunch and I gotta get my computer glasses on.\"
    I right away forgot about the tix and asked her about this. She said her eye doc
    had prescribed single-vision lenses for looking at the monitor at work.\r\n\r\nI
    went to my eye doc next day and got just that. Right away the discomfort across
    my shoulders went away. The main problem with this is that I cannot see much beyond
    my arm's length. If I forget to take them off when I leave my office, I often
    walk past other staff members and have no idea who they are unless I see and hear
    them frequently and know their general shapes and sounds. That's a problem in
    a building with a couple hundred employees.\r\n\r\nAt the office, looking at a
    19\" monitor [I forget what make it is], I wear the glasses against my head. Right
    now, at home working ob a 17\" Macintosh laptop, I have to shove them down my
    nose to see better.\r\n\r\nIf bifocals bother you when looking at a monitor, get
    single-vision lenses just for looking at the monitor.\r\n\r\npowers"

    are far better than bi- or trifocal lenses. This way I devote all my lens space
    to the project on the monitor. & since I'm setting books, that means I must also
    have constant reference to a ms or a set of proofs lying right in front of me.
    So all is in the same plane when I look.\r\n\r\nWhen I want to look out the window
