  similar weathered edges, especially for day spas lol, and I am wondering what are
  some better fonts with this look? \r\n\r\nSome other examples might be maybe Operina
  Romano, Allegheny, Old Claude, MVB Celestia Antiqua..."

  body: "@paul: oh i really like MVB Greymantle thanks!\r\n@sii: Do you reccomend
    one set of filters over the others so that i don't have to buy 3?\r\n@guerella:
    ahh tempus is nice but it is a bit too light for me i think.\r\n@stephen: Thanks
    some great fonts there. btw is there a name for these types of textured fonts?
    (just so i don't have to refer to papyrus lol)"
