  body: "And now your youthful indiscretion is forever noted in a Typophile thread.
    What a way to interact with type designers, some who do this professionally, and
    actually make a living by creating and selling these fonts! You needed a font
    enough to stiff another human being from making a living from their creative work?\r\n\r\nOkay
    I'll lay off for now but please think through your actions - they have consequences
    and not just for you."

    seriously, don't compromise your integrity.  You aspire to join the creative ranks
    of whoever designed the font you stole.  Are you planning to have your work distributed
    free of charge?  I don't think that would sit well with potential employers, nor
    would the liability associated with an employee who \"magically finds\" the resources
    she needs.  (Potential employers can find this thread via Google?  YES!)"
