    question: I have this font and would be willing to give it to Ilse (type2type)
    in a much better format. But I don't know if that's kosher. It seems preferable
    to her downloading a crappy knockoff, and if  Image Club doesn't distribute it
    anymore, why not? What say the powers that be?\r\n\r\nOK, I did a little homework
    and learned that Fonts.com acquired and distributes Image Club fonts. However
    Carolus Roman is not for sale on their site. If the Dafont version is all that's
    available that would be unfortunate."

  body: "Pattyfab,\r\nAs far as it being kosher. \"Kosherness\" takes two things into
    consideration.\r\n1. Copying software (this would include fonts) is a hotly debated
    topic amongst contemporary Rabbis. Since there are now copyright laws in the Torah
    (Bible) we look for a precedence in the law. According to the original law there
    would be nothing wrong with copying anything. Nobody owns ideas. The Jewish People's
    open-source platform and creativity produced some of the greatest stories and
    wisdom of the world. What could be not kosher is if you where copying and distributing
    intellectual property not for free but for sale, and therefore stealing the authors
    ability to make money. \r\n2.  When the jews found themselves exiled and living
    in rome they asked themselves \"do we have the moral obligation to follow roman
    laws?\" the answer was \"When in Rome... do as the romans do\" which is the source
    for that famous quote (from the jewish talmud.) therefore even if it is \"kosher\"
    it may not be kosher if the law of the land says it is illegal. That being said,
    the law must be a law which is of the land, meaning the people accept and follow
    it as law. For example stopping a full three seconds at the stop sign has never
    been accepted or followed as the law of the land. Therefore it is not binding.\r\n\r\nAs
    you can imagine, there are a lot of questions on this subject and I don't think
    the western world or the rabbis have settled the debate on the ethical implications
    of copying intellectual property. Questions like what is ownership? what is property?
    what is intellectual? what is a copy? Do people think it is unethical? the people
    that do not copy why do they not do it ? ethics? getting caught? who loses money?
    \r\n\r\nBy the way I think this is a lot of fun. And I keep Kosher."

    - I'm Jewish too but don't keep Kosher. I am well aware of the laws surrounding
    pirated fonts and software. I acquired my copy legally. THis font is now only
    available in a bad freebie copy. Ilse is willing to purchase a copy, legally,
    but can't. So it seems like an ethical grey area. Maybe I should ask that guy
    \"The Ethicist\" in the NY Times what he thinks. He usually replies to my emails."

    so he probably could tell you the status of these fonts. \r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/copyright1.html\">this
    interesting article</a> it is clear that according to current Orthodox Jewish
    religious law copyright should be respected. (I am not Orthodox.) In fact, soon
    after the invention of printing, a kind of copyright protection for printers of
    editions of traditional works was developed. Original works are another matter,
    and the article makes clear that the copyright of these is also respected, and
    not only on the grounds of  \"Dina De'Malchuta Dina\"--the law of the governing
    authorities is the law--but also ethical grounds.\r\n\r\nBy the way Psachyah,
    according to my 'Bartlet's Quotations' the 'When in Rome' quote comes from Robert
    Burton (1577-1640). I don't think it's in the Talmud. And even \"Dina De'Malchuta
    Dina\" has its limits, according to the above article.    "

    before going to the expert. It seemed to me that you where implying that because
    the font was no longer available for sale it might not be unethical to give it
    away for free. I assume the rationale behind this is that there is no loss of
    money to any party. If that is the case then there is nothing inherently unethical
    about copying. The unethical part of copying is removing somebody\u2019s potential
    to earn money through its sale. Was this your line of thought?"

  body: "Psachya, I know there is no unified body to decide what is Jewish law--the
    Sanhedrin hasn't met for quite a while!--so what is accepted often takes a generation
    at least for a clear majority view to arise. \r\n\r\nI thought this was a review
    article representing the current state of the debate, but I may well be wrong,
    as you say. Do you have other links--in English? \r\n\r\nThe basic thing is that
    in the traditional context, there was no concept of intellectual innovation as
    something that needed protection and promotion for the sake of the general welfare
    of the society. But the idea that the general welfare should be promoted is central
    in Jewish law, so frankly I would think that in a modern context it's a no-brainer
    to support copyrights and patents. Since this is an area where in general the
    rabbis have no power, I wouldn't suppose it has been focused on that much. \r\n\r\nThe
    exception is the issue of when photocopying of articles for education becomes
    unethical. Here there are arguments on both sides, as the article mentions. However,
    I think that where US courts came down is clearly right. If you wholesale photocopy
    articles for classes, you are depriving authors of deserved income--and doing
    that is against principles of Jewish law, as the article notes.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the background on 'When in Rome'. I had the feeling that it might have an
    earlier source than Burton, a Christian one--as Rome was their center--but I didn't
    see anything."

    October 2004 (Tishrei 5765), a group of rabbis claiming to represent varied communities
    in Israel undertook a ceremony in Tiberias, where the original Sanhedrin was disbanded,
    which they claim re-establishes the body. The nascent Sanhedrin was established
    by Rabbi Dov Levanoni, who received ordination from Rabbi Moshe Halberstam, a
    leader of the Eda Haredis' Beis Din Zedek religious court. Rabbi Levanoni ordained
    Rabbi Tzvi Idan as temporary Nasi, but he soon stepped aside in favour of well-known
    Jewish author Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sanhedrin and its importance

  body: "I still don't think that even if they ruled in favor of adopting copyright
    law into Halachahic Jewish Law that we could say that the current Orthodox law
    is such. This is because all Jewish law after the loss of a unified governing
    body -  which we had even until after the Babylonian talmud era - Is is left to
    the discretion of the rabbis in each community. Only something which they would
    all agree upon and except without exception, could be considered binding to all
    jews. But there are a lot of things which all rabbis agree upon and those meeting
    points would of-course define what is kosher or not, for those out side of that
    particular rabbi's community. \r\n\r\nI just do not think that we have excepted
    copyright law into the Halachic framework. When a law is excepted as halachah
    it has a lot more at stake then a parking meter violation. Jewish Law has as much
    to do with ones relationship to his creator as it does with encroaching on another
    citizen's right to make money, and in-fact they are one in the same. If Copyright
    law is part of jewish law, then by violating it I am severing my self from my
    creator and life-source. I am in a sense violating my very self, and the core
    of my being by copying someone's fonts. I began to feel that way, and although
    as a teenager I had amassed a load of pirated stuff I began the painful process
    of removing everything that I had which was \"free and easy\". But although I
    don't want to copy somebody's work, I do this not because of a religious or moral
    or ethical obligation but as courtesy to the one who made this program. I am affording
    him the rights he wishes to have. But do I think that a musician has some sort
    of existential right over a series of cords, or a typographer over the angle of
    an octothorp, no. "

  body: "Psachya, you are getting here into complicated questions about Jewish law
    and ethics, which I doubt that many here are interested in. \r\n\r\nJust briefly
    my point of view. As a practical matter, I think Jewish law as such has radically
    shrunk down to ritual matters, and for the orthodox community family law. So I
    think the application of Jewish values to issues such as copyright is more a matter
    of ethical guidelines than law. These are, however extremely important because,
    as you say, this involves being a spiritually whole person. \r\n\r\nI do think
    that we have to acknowledge that there is something new under the sun, and that
    includes the scientific, technical and artistic innovation that characterize the
    modern world. Ethically, intellectual property rights are absolute key to this
    world. The US founding fathers recognized this as the first law passed was the
    patent act. They were thinking about the future and how to ensure a good one.
    Maimonides said that all the ethical mitzvot are to insure the 'yishuv ha-olam',
    the settlement of the world. As the world changes, so the impact of ethical values
    changes. Copyright and patents and trademarks has to do with preserving the ability
    of the creator of a product to profit from it. Viewed this way, if the creation
    of copyright is justified in the modern world to enhance and protect creators
    of intellectual products, then copying something with out paying the owner is
    just theft. \r\n\r\nThe issue is really the justification of copyrights and patents.
    Once you accept that--and I think the case for it is overwhelming--then copying
    copyright material is definitely not kosher, by my reading of Jewish ethics. "

    .Than in Pattyfab's dilema it seems to me the only thing holding her back from
    letting the person have a font which for arguements sake is not for sale would
    be a  narrow minded \"orthodox\" view, staunchly insisting on the law for its
