    been thinking about myself: it reduces its minimum vertical space from 5 to 4
    units. <BR> <BR>Some suggestions: <BR>1. Try giving the UC &#34;J&#34; an upward
    curl on the left. <BR>2. Make the UC &#34;Q&#34; more of a &#34;Q&#34;. <BR>3.
    Make the &#34;heads&#34; of the numerals 4 and 9 bigger. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love
    to see this font succeed! <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR> <BR>Here are some that take your same route: <BR> <BR>Ditto on the numerals.

  body: ' I agree with Hrant and Stephen, especially on the uc &#34;Q&#34;. In the
    word &#34;Quka,&#34; the &#34;Q&#34; reads more like a &#34;C&#34;. I suspect
    this would happen in other settings as well. <BR> <BR>Also, your tilde &#40;~&#41;
    over the &#34;N&#34; and &#34;n&#34; could easily be confused with a macron &#40;&macr;&#41;.
    While context would help distinguish the two, and the macron would probably be
    rarer in use, I still think the tilde needs the swooping curl to distinguish it.
    <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I like the forms you&#39;ve developed. The &#34;@&#34; is
    great. Also, the distiguishing touches you worked into several of the similar-looking
    characters &#40;such as &#34;B&#34;, &#34;P&#34;, &#34;K&#34;, &#34;R&#34; and
    &#34;X&#34;; also &#34;k&#34; and &#34;x&#34;&#41; seem to be working effectively.
    <BR> <BR>Also, as with Hrant, I like the lc &#34;a&#34; a lot. <BR> <BR>I, too,
    would like to see this one succeed. I can already think of some uses for it. <IMG

    luck! <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' Thank you everyone for your comments. It&#39;s been really helpful and nice
    to see that other people like Quka. It gives me encouragment to work even harder
    on this face! <BR> <BR>Hrant: I note down your suggestions. I will give them a
    try. I was already doubting the UC Q. I have to do something with it. <BR> <BR>Stephen:
    Thank you for the links. It is always helpful to study other similar faces and
    see how the designer has solved the problems. <BR> <BR>David: Yes, i know, the
    tilde is not actually a tilde. But i couldn&#39;t find a good way to do it. I
    wouldn&#39;t really like to do a traditional curved tilde, but maybe i will have
    to. <BR> <BR>I am going to catch a flight to England today, and I will be &#34;offline&#34;
    in lovely Oxford until 2nd January. So Merry Christmas and enjoy yourselves! '
