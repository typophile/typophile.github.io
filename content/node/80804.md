  for the text: \r\nLAUREN HARRIS\r\nGARETH POWELL\r\nNOT THE ROLLING STONES\r\nDJ
  SCRUBS\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invite_5444.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's got
  a pretty distinctive 'J' and 'R' but the usual methods don't get close. The distressing
  looks custom or maybe a result of the stock used. \r\n\r\nA thousand thank-you's
  in advance for any help. Great board.\r\n\r\nDG"
