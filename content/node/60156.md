  body: "Dude, start over. Wipe the slate completely clean and try something entirely
    different. Alaskan pretty much covered all the details, so I won\u2019t restate.\r\n\r\nThink
    about the types of things this company makes and try to envision what kind of
    logo would belong on those things. For instance, if they make lawnmowers, think
    about what kind of logo you might see on a lawnmower, then do something better!
    \r\n\r\nSome questions to ask yourself that might help you to better define what
    your logo should implicitly communicate:\r\n\r\nIf the lawnmower company was a
    person, what kind of conversation would you expect to have with him (assuming
    lawnmower is male)? What kind of language (tone) would he use when he speaks?
    What kind of clothes would he wear? What kind of music would he listen to? What
    kind of car would he drive? \r\n\r\nAvoid making random design choices. Treat
    each design choice as part of the solution to your problem. If your problem is
    that you ran out of milk, you wouldn\u2019t spray your fridge with a fire extinguisher.\r\n\r\nHope
    some of this gets through. Good luck."

    visually, however you see fit, the values and personality of the brand. Your ideas
    thus far communicate <strong>nothing</strong> at all. It honestly looks like you
    put a bunch of letters and shapes in a hat and chose at random.  "

    far communicate nothing at all. It honestly looks like you put a bunch of letters
    and shapes in a hat and chose at random.\r\n\r\nThe client won't design, the client
    only decides...\r\n\r\nAbout the company:\r\n- OF COURSE they produce more than
    only lawnmowers... but everything they build has got wheels...\r\n- All the leading
    people in company are engineers/technicians...\r\n- It's a family enterprise with
    NO identification still yet...\r\n\r\nUnder that new aspects my logo of course
    communicates!\r\n\r\nAbout the \"E\":\r\nI've seen thousands of logos where a
    symbol was designed in a 'cramped' (artifical) way.\r\nDesigners (mostly rookies)
    did awful things in putting letters together for creating communication.\r\n\r\nHERE
    it seems to be a 'present of heaven' ;) where the both \"E\" are positioned.\r\nFurthermore
    the \"E\" and one of theyr self-developed parts (E-Splint) fit together in a perfect
    way... \r\nAnd if I won't use that facts everybody can insult me 'blind'!!!\r\n\r\nru

    assuming you mean that geographically \u2013, and I don't think your logos work.
    I might not have been as utterly dismissive of all of the variations as others
    have been, but I think you've really lost anyone who was still willing to give
    you constructive feedback when it became obvious that you do not accept anyone's
    suggestions. \r\n\r\nYou admit to not being a designer, you post your work up
    for critique (nota bene without giving any sort of substantial information about
    the project, the client, the brand). A great moment to be humble, and listen for
    a moment, and learn.\r\nBut instead of being willing to listen, and learn, and
    become more sensitive to the game that is design (or the place that is Typophile,
    for that matter), you just got loud and defensive, and now seem to try to teach
    everybody here that YES, your design WORKS!!!\r\nThen you start insulting regulars
    on their own blogs.\r\n\r\nRandom movie quote of the day: \"What we've got here
    is failure to communicate.\"\r\n\r\nI hope you begin to realize that you won't
    get much constructive help here, which is one of the best things this place has
    to offer, and which this place does best. Your loss.\r\n\r\nOver and out."

    you understand MY problem in this forum?\r\nI've got the feeling they don't criticise
