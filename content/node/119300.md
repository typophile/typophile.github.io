  body: If that still isn't light enough, you can always add a white stroke and set

  body: I'm using flexi, which is a sign making program...but I can adapt in that
    too. I looked through all my fonts and did not catch the match on Bank Gothic...wish
    I'd found this site last week!

  body: I didn't recognize it at first either--the sample is pretty low res. Good
    luck with your sign.
