  \r\n\r\n>City of Miami Beach is sponsoring a research project to test the legibility
  of the Futura typeface for use on directional signs. \r\n\r\n>This testing procedure
  is required by the Florida Department of Transportation to document that the Futura
  typeface, proposed for use by the City of Miami Beach, has equal or better legibility
  than the standard highway typefaces.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\nJust checked and no
  it's not April 1 yet ;-) Although it could be worse... http://www.abc.net.au/tropic/stories/s967707.htm

    Perhaps US Intelligence is sophisticated enough to find some. But will the Brits
    concur?"

  body: Futura would be considered an art deco typeface, no? If so it's quite appropriate
    for Miami architecture. I just finished comps for a presentation that will be
    held in Miami introducing new RCA artists and we went with an art deco theme and
    used Futura for the artists' names.

    is design logic in choosing Futura, given the role played by its classic art deco
    buildings in establishing Miami's architectural identity. Although there are comparable
    American faces which would be more authentic.\r\n\r\nWhile drivers look at signage
    briefly, signs are also a part of the urban environment that exists for everybody.
    This environment should not be reduced to a utilitarian lowest common denominator
    under the tyranny of the automobile.\r\n\r\nConcerning accident prevention: In
    the interests of road safety and climate change, it would be a good idea to make
    city centres pedestrian precincts, ban the manufacture of SUVs and limit all cars
    to 35 hp per seat. \r\n\r\nWith insurance companies leading the way, GPS chips
    in automobiles will soon be used to monitor the movement of various kinds of vehicle
    within municipalities, and progressive taxation may also be applied. "
