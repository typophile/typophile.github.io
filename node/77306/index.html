  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is a logo plate on a piece of equipment made by Blackhawk. Founded in 1910 as American Grinder and Manufacturing Company, changed its name to Blackhawk in 1925, bought Hydraulic Tool Company in 1927 and soon after began production of hydraulic tools for auto body and frame repair work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on restoring an art deco-ish styled steel case for a small Porto-Power set. The really bad looking one is what&rsquo;s on the case. I&rsquo;ve re-created the Porto-Power lettering and the indian head from scratch.</p>
<p>What I need are fonts as close as possible to the black lettering. I can add the tails or whatever on the tops of the A&rsquo;s by hand.</p>

<p>Poking around the web some more I found RockoELF <a href="http://www.fontspace.com/casady-and-greene/rockoflf">http://www.fontspace.com/casady-and-greene/rockoflf</a> I can stretch it sideways a bit to match the slightly squat shape on the logo.</p>
<p>I think I should be able to find a font with the different stroke weights of the small Blackhawk text. I&rsquo;ve seen many fonts like that, usually with &lsquo;deco&rsquo; in the name.</p>
<p>The large Blackhawk text is what there seems to be nothing like. It has the weight and stroke widths and bulbous serifs of fonts like Cooper Black, <em>but</em> they&rsquo;re also concave serifs. It&rsquo;s like Cooper on a diet, practically anorexic. ;) If I end up having to construct it by hand I may just create a whole font based on it, at least the basic letters and digits.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I gave up on trying to find anything close to the big Blackhawk lettering and knocked it together from scratch in a nonstop session.</p>
<p>I have only been able to find three examples of this style of the logo, and they&rsquo;re all slightly different, especially the large Blackhawk letters.</p>
<p>One of them has big differences in the Indian head and its large Blackhawk lettering doesn&rsquo;t appear to have the concave serifs, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell due to the small image size, and overall it&rsquo;s much lighter, with the A feathers thinner and straighter.</p>
<p>The other example has almost the same Indian head as this one but the big Blackhawk lettering is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling it good enough for restoring the tool case. :)</p>
<p>Should anyone want to muck about with this, just ask and I&rsquo;ll e-mail you the PSD files. While doing the big Blackhawk letters I also made an I and a V while making the H and W. The original letters were inconsistent a whole bunch with the serifs so I made one then copied and scaled it as needed. Since all the BLACK part was obscured except the tip of the lower leg of the K, I had to wing it on the B, L and C. They&rsquo;re based on those letters from the &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; style but using the building blocks I made doing the HAWK part. KHAWK is placed exactly as in the original, I used a square shape as a one shot measuring stick to space the B from the left edge of the hexagon then nudged the LAC around until they looked good enough to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not absolutely perfect, but the hand drawn original wasn&rsquo;t perfect. I did adjust the centering of the small text and the hexagon was somewhat irregular, with the sides vertical the top and bottom points weren&rsquo;t right on center.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have a whole font of these characters, just because of those funky bulbous/concave serifs that&rsquo;re unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a font. I might get around to doing a TTF if I ever get un-busy enough from my classic car plastic parts reproduction business. I have done a TrueType font a few years ago, based on the KING COBRA 5.0 letters used on the 1978 Mustang King Cobra, even did lowercase.</p>
<p>A font based on the Porto-Power letters would also be nifty, but inventing 25 more stylized caps that have the same look and feel as those P&rsquo;s? Ack! I&rsquo;ll leave that up to people who do things like create an entire font based on four letters, like the Nash script font used by the Nash Car Club for their magazine.</p>
