  maximum legibility. K-Type has tried to capture the strength and clarity of Comic
  Sans without the comic book associations. Features like the non-symmetrical b and

  from the [[http://www.k-type.com/fontlexia.html|K-Type Independent Type Foundry]].\r\n\r\nI'm
  not gonna laugh, because it is for a noble purpose. I'm not gonna laugh, because

  body: "That is remarkably lofty language considering! I am fairly sure that even
    Vincent Connare himself would not hold Comic Sans as the apogee of 'strength and
    clarity'. Although I also think people have made a bit too much sport out of the
    font. In any event, thanks for the chuckle.\r\n\r\nThis font isn't all that bad
    - even though I don't think they quite arrived where they were aiming. \r\n\r\nBut
    it is interesting to see an urge towards the sense of the middle, the plain, normal,
    or as they less precisely put it  a place 'without Comic associations' playing
    out in this way. I don't know if I think they are asking for something short but
    tall ( a no-place) - or if the idea of a clear strong and subtly school house
    flavored sans is actually a niche needing filling. I am leaning towards the latter.
    In some ways the territory of Gotham Rounded isn't that far away."
