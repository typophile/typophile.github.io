body: Hello, I'm currently working on a job for a mall client and I need to replace
  a couple letters, but they no longer have the font used for the channel letters.
  I need the same font so I can remake the same letters I need to replace. It needs
  to be same font or the mall won't approve the sign. So I'd appreciate it if you
  guys were able help me identify this font. Thanks! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_06622_6590.jpg]
