    |G|? \r\nor maybe the released font is a bit different.. I don't know"

  body: "Quoted from the same page in my previous post\r\n<blockquote>In early 2011
    we decided to re-visit this bespoke typeface and extend it into a single weight
    release. We present Transcript Bold, a slightly condensed grotesque.</blockquote>\r\nSo,
    I guess this is part of their re-visit (adding a spur to /G and probably some
    more)."
