body: "I've been trying to put together a memorable, simple, and relevant logo for
  a laboratory I'm setting up. I was here <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/36926\">a
  while ago</a>, where <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/36926#comment-227633\">a
  particularly helpful comment</a> prompted me to abandon the line of thought there.\r\n\r\nI'm
  back now with a new name and a new concept.  Mostly this is just an exercise in
  developing a logo because it's fun. My lab won't be the only <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=nonlinear+dynamics+laboratory\">Nonlinear
  Dynamics Laboratory</a>, so I figure that if nothing else, I can have the best branding.
  In particular, I'm trying to make a logo that can stand on its own without the long
  name.\r\n\r\nHere's the first idea I have, which is to add a recognizable nonlinearity
  to a logotype of the initials.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_4691.png]\r\n\r\n(Note
  to the curious: all of the gimmicks are relevant to the research that might go on
  in the lab, though some are more recognizable than others. The mockups are based
  on 1) a <a href=\"http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/~moisy/Disques/spipos.gif\">spiral vortex
  on a rotating disk</a>, 2) a signal showing <a href=\"http://www.flometrics.com/products/fluids_lab/reynolds_experiment.html\">laminar-turbulent
  transition</a>, and 3) \"distributed roughness elements\" (too esoteric to link)
  or <a href=\"http://www.uni-saarland.de/fak7/wagner/uploads/pics/Vortices.JPG\">Taylor
  vortices</a>. I could also do something like the <a href=\"http://www.onera.fr/photos-en/tunnel/images/255551-von-karman.jpg\">von
  Karman vortex street</a> or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif\">Rayleigh-Taylor
  instability</a> because they're pretty and famous, but I'm less likely to do research
  into them and they're harder to get into illustrator.)\r\n\r\nThe white-on-black
  version is promising, but I can't think of a way to complete the left side of the
  N.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_inverse_5071.png]\r\n\r\nAnother
  possibility is the vortex without the NDL. I like this for its simplicity, but I'm
  concerned that the vortex isn't distinctive enough on its own.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_ifree_4590.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  comments or ideas?"

  body: Hey Michael, I really like the look and feel of the logo and type treatment.
    I have to say that the L might be a little ambiguous on your letter shape. I also
    wanna point out that the third one could be misconstrued as something less scientific
    happening. Both the von Karmen and the instability that you didn't do should be
    easily traceable with the pen tool, plus you might have some more creative control.
    Also maybe reworking the second one could produce something a little more appealing,
    maybe try moving those strands out so that they meet on the border of the D counter(bowl?)?

  body: "Thanks for the comment. Here are a couple quick ones with the traced vortex
    street and an idea for bounding the left side of the N in the white-on-black version.
    I'm sure that the placement of the street can be improved.\r\n\r\nI agree with
    the problem with the L part of the logotype, but I'm not sure what to do about
    it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_3967.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_wob_square_vks_6714.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    basic NDL concept seems familiar, but I can't figure out whose logo it reminds
    me of. Does anybody know?"

    it as NLDL, and not NDL, you may get a few other interesting possibilities. I
    just scribbled a couple of ideas in case you'd like to think along those lines:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lnldl1_5464.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nldl_6053.jpg]"

  body: "The second scribble is interesting, but I think it too easy to read the L
    first. (I'm aware that there's precedent in Texas A&M's magical ATM logo.) I'll
    play around with some similar concepts and see if I can make something work.\r\n\r\nI
    see the snail now. It's a good thing to consider with the current initialtype.\r\n\r\nA
    friend of mine suggested this option:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonliner_itex_6661.png]\r\n\r\nI
    like the use of dot on the i, but I can't decide where to put the Texas A&M."

    icon, imagery does not seem right at this moment in time. The colour doesnt feel
    right either. Hmm...I was thinking light blue, test tubes, coloured chemicals
    etc. What kind of laboratory is this, may I ask? What things do you deal with?
    What about adopting hazadous symbols seen on chemical bottles within the typography? '

    with a label that says it's FDA-approved and the flow-visualization flakes are
    safe for use generally in the area surrounding the eye (because they're normally
    used in eye shadow). The imagery is pretty close to what I'm doing, which is more
    math than mad science.\r\n\r\nI will have some sweet lasers though..."

    with a waterfall-looking thing over the initials.  It was cool, and conveyed \"nonlinear\"
    and \"dynamic\" in the colloquial sense of the words in addition to the scientific.
    \ \r\n\r\nAnd I agree that the \"L\" is hidden - I didn't even know it was supposed
    to be there until I read the comments!"

  body: I recommend ditching the NDL idea.  Initials are static, defined and by their
    very nature and essence, linear.  Consider some shapes involved with chaos and
    nonlinear systems.  Any way that you could use fractals as an inspiration?  Unless
    I betray a complete and utter ignorance of the topic at hand...

  body: I don't like to point this out, but the pattern element just detracts from
    the type and information. It doesn't feel harmonious. It doesn't feel right. It's
    where the eye is led to straight away. I wish there was more going for it. Have
    you had any chance to develop further? It seems too chaotic to me. It's the pattern.
    It disturbs me. I don't like to say it but i've had to. What about a pattern in
    the 'O' of the name of the company. There could be a whole new world involved
    with the 'O'. The world where all these things happen. Hmm...am I going crazy?
