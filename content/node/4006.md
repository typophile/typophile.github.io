    make head nor tales from what you just wrote. What&#39;re you getting at, Hrant?

  body: I must confess I&#39;m not particularly a fan of Slimbach&#39;s, and I don&#39;t
    know what he&#39;s been up to these past few years. Last thing I know of is his
    exquisite interpretation of <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1715.jhtml?id=type-010"
    TARGET="_blank"> Jenson</A> from 1996. <BR> <BR>I just checked Adobe&#39;s site.
    So he did <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1709.jhtml?id=type-010"
    TARGET="_blank"> Warnock</A> and that <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/today-sans/"
    TARGET="_blank"> Today Sans</A> <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1733.jhtml?id=type-010"
    TARGET="_blank"> rip-off</A>, some scripts... What else have I been missing out?
    Most of his work is a bit too slick for my taste though. That&#39;s always been
    my main problem with Zapf too. <BR> <BR>Remember Picasso, who even in his early
    realistic paintings added a jarring element because &#34;perfection is boring&#34;.

  body: ' Warnock is actually not bad, although it still has some of that trademark
    sterility deep down. As for Zapf, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s as &#34;slick&#34;.
    Perfection: the nice thing about it is that it doesn&#39;t exist. Problems become
    manifest when you try too hard to reach it. <BR> <BR>hhp '
