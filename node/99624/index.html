That's a problem. I know it's not easy to be so upstanding, but -knowing that it hurts the people who make those fonts that help you make money- at least don't be so cavalier about it. Not <em>here</em>.

BTW, I have four kids, so that's not good advice.

Maybe you don't realize this (although ignorance isn't really a robust defense) but: already having pirated fonts doesn't make it OK; people aren't supposed to send you (commercial) fonts, not even people who are paying you.

Especially since I make fonts myself I don't appreciate the cavalier attitude you seem to be representing. BTW, FWIW after you mentioned MyFonts I decided to give you the benefit of the doubt and reveal the names, Mike just beat me to one of them. But that doesn't mean I'm totally OK with where you stand (even if you don't fully realize where you stand).

<blockquote>Did anyone in charge here at Typophile appoint you as the enforcer of this creed?</blockquote>

No de facto or de jure authority whatsoever. All I have is my voice.

And I'm not crazy enough to suggest that any font ID should lead to a sale. But commercial font <em>usage</em> should.

And let me ask: Are you OK with people taking advantage of Typophile and type designers? Don't you see how often that's been happening, here of all places? And most of all: What do <em>you</em> want Typophile to be? Maybe I think whatever that is stinks? If so, should I try to shut you up? I've never done that to anybody here, in 12+ years.

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Hrant</strong>, while I’m completely with you on attempting to keep piracy and outline theft to a minimum your initial position here <em>was</em> totally uncalled for. With straight commercial fonts the best we can do is link to a legitimate source and hope that it (or an equivalent) is where the font is subsequently sourced.

We can’t start from an a priori position that those posting ID queries are going to get the fonts by some illegitimate means; if after the ID is made there’s some direct hint that they are then yeah, we should try to educate them that that is theft.

<strong>Angelz25</strong>, while I understand your frustration here it doesn’t give you the moral high ground and somehow make it OK to sling insults! And in case it got lost in the shuffle: in most cases <em>it is not okay to accept fonts from a client, because they do not have the right to give them to you</em>. It is irrelevant that this is common practice or that you’ve done it before.</div>

Identifying fonts? Partially. Doing your homework for you? No.</div>

They don't identify the fonts they use.
(As stated previously. Can't you READ?)
Which is why I asked here.
I did NOT have them on my computer.
WHICH IS WHY I ASKED HERE.
I wasn't asking ANYBODY to "do my homework". I tried numerous different avenues of identifying the fonts myself with no success.
WHICH IS WHY I ASKED HERE.
