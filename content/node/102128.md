  condo owner's manual in English and French which includes some measurements in inches.
  Client says the fractions must be typeset as in B.\r\n\r\nI'm almost dead certain
  you never set fractions with a hyphen in English text, unless there's a convention
  about doing this in the building trades that I don't know about. I would always
  set a number and fraction together as in A.\r\n\r\nI'm not as dead certain about
  French. This is in Quebec, not France (where of course this would be metric and
  so much simpler).\r\n\r\n(I am also reminded those should be double primes, not
  close quotes. But they're not the issue.)\r\n\r\nI've looked long and hard for French
  typesetting norms but this specific circumstance isn't covered by anything I've
  found."

  body: Somebody's confused. Possibly because fractions written as words use a hyphen
    as in two-thirds. In years of reading mathematical texts I have never seen the
    hybrid (read bastardized) form that your client favors. - Herb

    from a plotter program but that does not in any way qualify as typography. For
    an Owner's Manual, Style A is the only correct way to do it.\r\n\r\nYou could
    refer your client to the Chicago Manual of Style as a confirmation. You may be
    able to find it at your local library."

    be displayed using regular sized (typewriter, for example) figures, such as 1-3/4.
    In English, not when fractions ure used.\r\n\r\nBut Canada's a strange country.
    Once stayed in a hotel in Toronto where the instructions on how to use the coffee
    maker were entirely pictures. No words. So, of course, and I suppose by law, the
    pictures were there twice -- once for English, once for French..."

  body: Inanest case, you could tell your client that putting hyphens where subtraction
    is not intended and using double quotes instead of double primes to signify inches
    Does Not Conform To Law. That it happens to be Strunk's Law...

  body: "As Charles said, hyphens are used sometimes with fractions that are made
    using regular-sized numbers. Probably started back in the typewriter days, and
    is still seen today sometimes when type is set amateurishly or in things like
    emails.\r\n\r\nI see it a lot on the web, and the Yahoo Style Guide even tells
    how to do it: \"...if coding the fraction is impractical, use numerals for the
    whole number, followed by a hyphen and the fractional part written as x/y (as
    in 1-1/2 or 2-3/8).\"\r\n\r\n> Client says the fractions must be typeset as in
    B.\r\n\r\nHe's seen it done that way and assumes it's correct. Show him examples
    of correct fractions in books, magazines, etc."

  body: "I tend to agree that the customer is always right. But I would desperately
    try to avoid the confusion caused by a hyphen also looking like a minus sign.\r\n\r\nSo
    instead of 6-1/2, I would try 6_1/2, 6&1/2, or, as suggested, 6+1/2.\r\n\r\nOne
    can't do 6,1/2 since in most European languages the comma, rather than the period,
    serves as the decimal point, thus being even more confusing than a hyphen. (Note,
    too, that in typeset material, the minus sign tends to look more like an em dash
    than a hyphen, so this may not be as bad as it seems from typed material where
    - is the minus sign for programming languages.)"

    for this use of a dash, I believe it is standard on architectural drawings. I

    hyphen-minus character in <em>both</em> senses: -1/2\" is exactly 4 inches away
    from 3-1/2\".\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, things would be much easier if the meanings
    of the plus and minus signs were swapped.\r\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_rods#Rod_numerals
    (you might have to scroll down a bit)\r\nAlas, it is far too late to change things
    from the way they now stand.\r\n\r\nAs for \"the customer is always right\": I
