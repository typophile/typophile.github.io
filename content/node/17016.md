  body: You could achieve siilar results using almost any thin sans serif. There is
    no font that does what your sample does - it's obviously done by hand.

  body: "Believe it or not, this really is a font, a very obscure Letraset font from
    1974 called Penny Farthing. This may be the first time I've seen it used outside
    a Letraset catalog. It was dropped after a few years and I don't know of any digital
    version. Here is a scan from the brochure in which it was introduced:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/penny-farthing.jpg]"

  body: I thought it was pretty dumb when I first saw it way back when. A solution
    looking for a problem. I still think so. Avant Garde it ain't.

    Not the same font, but it uses the same stacked letter approach."

  body: It's pretty amazing how much of an Eastern feel the type gets just stacking
    some of the letters as in 'Seoul Stacking'

    Stacking\r\n\r\nNow that's a goddam cool idea - pardon my Korean. And if it were
    anybody else but me you might be shocked to hear this, but: this might actually
    be an avenue of increasing readability.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
