  find the first version on Typophile in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/52253\">this</a>
  node. This wordmark represents my initials which I am hoping the viewer can interpret
  clearly right away (they are posted in the O.P. of the above node if you cannot).\r\n\r\nNew
  version:\r\n\r\nhttp://i51.tinypic.com/2m4u2zc.jpg\r\n\r\nI love how it looks right
  now, but I will also take into account any (constructive) feedback.\r\n\r\n~ corey"

  body: Hi, I think it's too wide;it doesn't remind me of CV,more like DOV.

  body: I too think it reads DAV rather unambiguously. Nice curves and the choice
    of color nonetheless.

  body: I'm afraid it's 'DAV' for me as well. Perhaps there could be a larger break
    where the top of the 'C' comes down to form the crossbar of the 'A'?

    also think that the corners needs some work - they seem slightly chubby. "
