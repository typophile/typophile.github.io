  body: I believe this may be a [[squooshed]] <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_garamond_std_book/?sample_text=COFFEE%20COMPANY">ITC
    Garamond</a>. The designed <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_garamond_std_book_condensed/?sample_text=COFFEE%20COMPANY">Condensed</a>
    version would be better. Though <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/entry.html?id=205">some
    would argue</a> that <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Garamond">any
    Garamond</a> is better than ITC's.
