body: I was recently told by someone that when designing a glyph a bezier point shouldn&#39;t
  represent a full corner. rather there should be two bezier points defining a curve.
  i opened an emigre font that i own, and found this to be the case. could someone
  explain this reasoning to me, i heard it deals with rasterization.

  body: Look for a book this Summer by Leslie Cabarga that explores the best techniques
    for glyph drawing and orthagonal points.  Better yet, ask him yourself at Typecon!
    <BR> <BR>Bring your glyph into FOG and add points to extema. You&#39;ll see that
    points are added to the furthest areas that define the shape of the glyph. <BR>
    <BR>The key is to create all your glyphs using these points almost exclusively.

    serious fidelity issues if you output to TT from cubic &#40;PS-style&#41; data,

  body: 'Ok, I just have to chime in about this. I don&#39;t know what the appeal
    of Moye&#39;s book is. I bought it way back when I was starting with Fontographer,
    and I hated the book so much that I took it back to Tower and asked for my money
    back. <BR> <BR>Tutorials on how to make auto-bolded Helvetica Oblique small caps?
    What the hell? I don&#39;t know, it just didn&#39;t seem up to snuff. And the
    book is set in like 24pt Goudy Handtooled or something. <BR> <BR>Last year I found
    a copy for $18, and sold it on Amazon for $150. I should have kept it around to
    squeeze another $1000 out of it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I have always wanted a good technical reference
    on this stuff, but out of necessity I have played around so much that it&#39;s
    no longer quite the holy grail I once thought it would be. I thought about writing
    my own, but I just know it would be like, &#34;Well, then you kinda do this, and
    then this, and then you just gotta feel it out from there.&#34; <BR> <BR>Now,
    to Tim&#39;s original inquiry. If you&#39;re talking about extrema points, Hrant&#39;s
    right, they make things easier to work with, and they&#39;re desirable on the
    technical side &#40;hinting/rasterization&#41;. However, they&#39;re not always
    needed for the little details, as David Lemon explains in this PDF about hinting:
    <a href="http://www.pyrus.com/downloads/hinting.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.pyrus.com/downloads/hinting.pdf</a>
    <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re talking about each curve having two BCPs: the reason this
    is needed is because pulling out one BCP automatically implies that there is a
    BCP on the other end of that curve segment. But if the other one is not pulled
    out, it&#39;s considered to be located directly on top of the anchor point, which
    is a PostScript no-no, or something. <BR> <BR>FontLab does a particularly good
    job of encouraging the designer to construct curves properly, by the way that
    it displays BCPs and anchor points. <BR> <BR>Alan'

    so he has a good grasp of the technical requirements for clean outlines, nodes

    trying to refer to mutual copyright protection treaties. If not Venezuela, maybe
    Cuba - anyway, there&#39;s a number of choices. Which would I recommend? Lebanon.
    Although Lebanon is signatory to copyright treaties, you really have nothing to
    worry about, plus Beirut is the rockingest place to visit &#40;and live, depending&#41;.
