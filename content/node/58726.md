body: "Creating a new font in FontLab.... I've set up Mask and Background layers (based
  on an old font) in all glyph cells of the new font. Although many of the cells of
  my new font do not currently contain outline glyphs (for example the \"onehalf\"
  fraction). I would like to use the Mask and Background layers as positioning guides
  while drawing new outline glyphs.\r\n\r\nBut each time I use the Glyphs > Create
  Glyphs command ( for example - to quickly get my digits and slash into my \"onehalf\"
  fraction cell)  I loose my Mask and Background layers. They are now deleted from
  my \"onehalf\" fraction cell, but this is precisely where I need them as a positioning
  guide.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite tedious to add the Mask and Background layers back
  in each time. Better to generate  them all at once in the beginning.\r\n\r\nIs there
  anyway to prevent FontLab from deleting the Mask and Background when using the Create
  Glyphs command?\r\n\r\nGracias."

  body: "I'm not sure about background layers, never use them, but you could use the
    font-to-mask tool. Just keep your reference font open and it copies either selected
    glyphs or the entire font onto the mask layer. Here's the icon for it.  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_3739.gif]"
