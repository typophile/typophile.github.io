  sometimes mis-identified as Univers Condensed, but the lower case \u201Cg\u201D
  is totally different, as is the upper case \u201CS\u201D. It's also commonly mistaken
  for SF Movie Poster.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1941

  body: This is probably a photocompositor font that has not been digitized. Your
    best bet is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/titling_gothic_compressed/">Tilting
    Gothic</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/red_rooster/block_gothic_extra_condensed/">Block
    Gothic</a>.

  body: Photocompositor??!?!?  Nuts.  I had the same issue when looking for Alpha
    Midnight.  I hope this isn't the case again.  Thanks for your response.

  body: "Yep, anything produced before 1990 is likely either hand drawn or pre-digital
    typography.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/venus_light_condensed_ot_std_urw/\">Venus
    Light Condensed</a> is even closer than my other suggestions."
