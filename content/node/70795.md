body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand how TrueType works but I have some difficult
  time with how glyph selection works. I mean, a user types in a sequence of Unicode
  characters, i.e. Unicode code-points. TrueType cmap specifies various formats of
  mapping between code-points and actual glyphs data stored in .ttf (.otf). But sometimes
  there in font are ligatures, stylistic variants and what not - how are those selected?
  I assume Unicode does not define a code-point for 3rd swash of capital F.\r\n\r\nRelated
  question, when I look at a font through MS ttfdump, there is different number of
  entries in cmap than the count of all the glyphs.\r\n\r\nPlease, could someone explain
  to me how this works?"

  body: "The translation from text string to displayed string is not <em>entirely</em>
    a Unicode procedure.\r\n\r\nHigh-level text APIs (such as Uniscribe) can interrogate
    the font for its features. This may return, for example, a list of glyphs forming
    ligature combinations. The high level API then creates a list of glyphs (Unicode
    or not) and displays them by itself.\r\n\r\n<cite>Related question, when I look
    at a font through MS ttfdump, there is different number of entries in cmap than
    the count of all the glyphs.</cite>\r\n\r\nPart of it is because the cmap may
    define glyphs more than once -- Carriage Return, Space, Non-breaking space all
    may map to the same glyph. Same with hyphen, non-breaking hyphen, and discretionary
    hyphen. So this accounts for <em>less</em> glyphs than cmap points.\r\nIf the
    font contains Opentype features, the font file may have additional glyphs that
    cannot be mapped (just about anything, from Small Caps to composite characters
    to ligatures and alternates).\r\n\r\nIt's also quite possible a font has glyphs
    that are not \"meant\" for regular use -- I think Cambria Math may be an example,
    as its extra glyphs cannot be accessed through the usual OTF features, and you
    need specialized software (which?) or manually insert the glyphs you want (meaning,
    you need a Glyph Selection panel such as in InDesign)."

  body: If I understood correctly, it might not be possible to access all the glyphs
    of a font via cmap, right? What should I do then, if I want to write "x^2" (x
    squared, "2" is superscript)? In other words, how does InDesign's Glyph Selection
    panel work? I assume it is possible to list all the glyphs of a font (i.e. output
    the content of glyf or CFF?), but how would such text look like (say, in memory)?
    Is it possible to e-mail "x^2" so that it displays correctly (if the font is available)?

  body: "Tuom, \r\n\r\nwhat you're talking about is OpenType Layout. \r\n\r\nI recommend
    reading http://www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/intro.mspx as a
    starter. \r\n\r\nWith OpenType Layout, the representation in memory must be formatted/styled
    text, not plain text. It's up to the software vendor to choose the appropriate
    representation. Unfortunately, RTF (a quite common cross-vendor format for styled
    text) does not have standard means to store OpenType Layout formatting, although
    Apple made some custom extensions to RTF that work within Mac OS X (so you can
    copy-paste between Pages or Keynote or TextEdit and retain OpenType Layout formatting).
    \r\n\r\nHTML, being another cross-vendor format for styled text, also currently
    has no standard means to retain this information, but CSS3 has is planning to
    include properties that allow authors to turn specific OpenType Layout features
    on or off on a portion of text. There's an editor's draft available at \r\nhttp://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/\r\n\r\nIn
    that case, your x^2 example would look like <code>x&lt;span style=\"character-transform:superscript\"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's
    XML dialect XAML used in Windows Presentation Foundation also has extensive formatting
    clauses for OpenType Layout features. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"
