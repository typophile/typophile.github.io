body: "People ask about corner rounding scripts from time to time here at Typophile.
  I have heard about several people writing these scripts, but I couldn't find any
  that were publicly available, so I wrote one for some projects I was working on
  last year. I dusted it off recently, cleaned it up a little and thought I'd put
  it out there. It's pretty simple \u2013\_only 90 lines of python - but it can be
  easily hacked to support a variety of projects. For example, I modified it to curve
  the same point across several masters.\r\n\r\nIt seems like corner rounding is a
  common enough operation in type design that it is a good candidate for a new tool
  in FontLab.\r\n\r\n[[http://betatype.com/node/38]]"
