    been working on one on-and-off for the past year using my mother's maiden name
    for a tattoo, maybe someday I'll grow the balls to post it on here."

  body: "Well, this is the ultimate proof that less is indeed more...\r\nLike sch2525
    said it's so legible it doesn't even look like am ambigram at a first glance.
    Thumbs up for whoever made it!\r\nIt reminds me of another simple ambigram that's
