  body: "John, no actually. I was going to post to say that anybody in a position
    to celebrate the 4th of July* is one of the luckiest people on this planet. But
    I thought certain people would accuse me of being a politician. I had a great
    4th, and I hope everybody else did!  The USA has greatness - it's in the top tier
    among the world's nations. Now let's realize it, instead of going backwards.\r\n\r\n*
    As I have been for almost 20 years. I even celebrated it in 2000 while in Armenia.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
