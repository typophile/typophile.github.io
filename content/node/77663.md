body: "Hi all, I have a client who uses FF DIN for correspondence et al, and they're
  now considering introducing it on their web site too. So now I'm looking for some
  (1) examples (2) opinions on FF DIN Web for (not-too-tiny) body text. \r\n\r\nI'm
  suspecting it should work relatively well with its minimal/geometric design, and
  I've so far found one example \u2013 http://messagefirst.com/ \u2013 where it does
  look like it holds up quite well (also, the FontFonter.com). I've also seen the
  rendering examples/screenshots on the FontFont Flickr stream. Mostly what I'm looking
  for is some more nice examples, and educated opinion. Thanks.\r\n\r\nPS. I remember
  seeing a very handy overview, I think it was here on Typophile, about which combinations
  of OS/browser result in which rendering scenarios; but I can't find it again. Help?"
