  <BR> <BR>After you have answered this question go to your nearest pub and pour yourself
  a beer from the pump whilst the barmaid isn&#39;t looking.

  body: Lots more similars listed <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14336.html">here</a>.
    However, knowing the pixelsurgeon folks, it&#39;s probably a custom geometric
    linear one-off.

  body: Cheers geezers. I was aware of these fonts already and it was also my suspicion
    that it would be a custon font. However, I still hold out hope that I can get
    that particular font from somewhere. I think you should all pour yourselves a
    beer anyway. And together we&#39;ll crack it.

    is.

    here on this forum <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I would imagine that they wouldn&#39;t be too
    happy about someone using the same font as them. They seem quite interested in
    building their own brand.
