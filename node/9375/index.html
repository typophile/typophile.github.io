<div class=commentbody>It's a bit ridiculous to talk about 'fonts' when you are looking at some sort of metal castings. The point is that not EVERYTHING is from a computer font. There was lettering for hundreds of years without digital fonts, and obviously every form of lettering has not been digitized. So much lettering was done by hand, and will never be re-created. <br> <br>Chris, it would be nice if you would give us a break, and post one image at a time per thread, and try to consider whether asking about a 'font' for manufactured lettering is a reasonable request. <br> <br>Can I ask what your reason is for these shotgun style ID requests?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Whatever happened to looking through books of typeface samples, hour after hour? You'd learn a lot more about type and lettering that way. <br>Asking a forum on the web is faster, true, but the time you save is the difference between real knowledge and trivia.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have been looking through typeface sample books and have identified around 30 typefaces using this method. The reason for the use of the forum is that there is a greater wealth of knowledge than a few books can provide. <br> <br>People bring their own experiences, influences etc in the identification of a specific typeface which then leads me back to typeface specimen books. I am not loosing out on using a forum I am infact learning more.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Chris, sorry about the tenseness of some replies. We've <br>experienced an exponential growth since 2003, and since <br>the MyFonts forums closed down a couple of months ago <br>traffic increased even more. Add to this the Board software <br>which behaves erratically and which ate two year's worth of <br>archives we used to rely on as reference material plus recent <br>postings with multiple IDs per thread... it tends to get a bit much. <br> <br>Also, your identification request might annoyed some of us <br>as obviously it's quite unrealistic to expect them to be matched <br>with typefaces. Lettering on metal pipes, stone engraving, <br>traffic signs and so on all use custom made character sets <br>that are specifically produced for the medium they're intended <br>for. The medium and technical restrictions determine the shapes, <br>so it's very hard to come up with equivalents in type. <br> <br>I'm not saying this to justify some of the above (over)reactions; <br>I only want to put them into context.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This being said, regarding your samples: <br> <br>1. is very hard to match due to the heavy corrosion of the <br>charactershapes; in fact any Grotesque might do, so Ryan's <br>Univers Condensed is just as good a suggestion as Helvetica <br>Condensed or Trade Gothic Bold. <br> <br>2. is obviously "hand drawn" as the R shape is quite clumsy. <br>In order to approximate these characters any of Romesh's <br>proposals will do: Bliss, Gill Sans or Underground. <br> <br>3. looks very much like Romesh's suggestion Trajan indeed. <br> <br>I don't agree about 4. tho, which to me looks more like Berthold's <br><a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=BQ90030010P1" target=_blank> Akzidenz-Grotesk Bold</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK people, I've sent private e-mails to both Chris and Mike as the <br>situation threatened got out of hand. Let's get one thing straight. <br>You already might've noticed that I'm taking a more pro-active <br>stance in policing this Board. This means I <i>will not</i> tolerate childish <br>nor rude behaviour, but also that I expect everyone to be courteous, <br>even when dealing with what some of us might perceive as <br>unrealistic ID requests. Nobody <i>forces</i> anyone to contribute, so <br>if you feel the conversation is about to turn sour, I'd rather you <br>simply abstain from posting, unless it's really waranted. <br> <br>In this particular instance I feel Mike and maybe Christopher as <br>well overreacted a bit, as nothing in the original post seemed <br>abusive to me. I can understand their reaction, but I don't agree. <br> <br>As for Chris, you're getting a second chance, don't expect to get <br>a third. <br> <br>Case closed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves - There are a few issues that seem to come up repeatedly - ie multiple IDs in one request, requests without samples linked or attached, requests for freebies, attachments in the wrong format, and (this one really bugs me) threads titled "Please help!" or "Can you ID this font?" instead of referring to the content. I'm sure there are other issues I'm forgetting. My point is, is there a way in the site header to try to make these points in a slightly more emphatic way - or at least to direct newbies to the FAQ before they go ahead and post?</div>

Also, I can confer with Joe'n'Jared to see what's <br>possible with the new Board software. <br> <br>Yaknow, stuff like mild electrical shocks when inputting a generic <br>topic title, mass porn spamming if the attachments aren't the right <br>file type and the likes...
