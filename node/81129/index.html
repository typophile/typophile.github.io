I don't really know if this experiment has identity enough to be considered a typeface in its own right. There's a companion italic in the works too, but I want to wait with that.

That contrast weirdness with the 'a' (and several other glyphs) is deliberate. Perhaps it's overdone ... I'll look into that. 

This is indeed supposed to be a text font, 8 points its intended size. The typeface, if developed, will have additional optical sizes of 10, 12, 18 and 60 points. 

I haven't printed it yet, and I'm ashamed to admit that I don't have access to a decent printer. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Glad you're doing this, and glad you're sharing it here. I love looking carefully at your designs - I think they're all top notch and this is no exception.

Some observations to take or leave:

I would consider dropping the /A/ crossbar a little.
I think the leg of /K/ and /R/ and the tail of /Q/ might be too dark. Maybe in addition /K/'s leg could use more of the straight vs curve tension that the other two have.

/W/'s middle vertex comes too high to my eye.

I'd like to see more variations for /e/. It's not the contrast weirdness that bugs me, but it just looks too soft. Is it worth trying a spur (or maybe just the hint of projection like the beard of /G/, which I love)? 

I'm not sold on /y/'s tail terminal. Would a flag terminal like /f/ has work there?

Diacritics look big--particularly tall, especially circumflex and caron.

I like the monoline zero, but think it could be a hint darker.

That four is seriously weird. Not necessarily a bad thing!

Tittles' rightward placement may be overdone a touch.

Favorite bits: /E/ is great; /b/c/m/ are all terrific; I like the "upside down" /s/; /2/ is very tightly wound but wonderfully drawn.

Looking forward to text sizes and settings. I'm eager to see whether that cusp on the right side of /U/ can work without being an eye-catcher.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you very much, Craig. It's great to be back. As usual, I think you've found the most important flaws in my design. That tall crossbar in 'A' is just a weird hangup I have (caused by the 'A' crossbar of Zapf's [[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/PALATINO01.GIF|original Palatino]].  Will be lowered. I'll make some 'e' variations. I really like its wide open mouth, but I agree the eye lacks character. That 'y' tail is a remnant from an earlier incarnation, where 'f', 'r' and even 'y' had similar terminals. The 'y' must go too, I agree. Are the 'r' and 'f' terminals slightly too light, by the way? 

It's well past midnight here, so redrawing will have to wait till tomorrow. Thanks again for invaluable feedback.

		<div class="commentbody">This reminds me of two things: my own Paphos*, which I started over a decade ago but soon stopped since I realized I wasn't ready to do it right (I'm still not ready); and Bremer Antiqua**, which is of course a much higher compliment. I like this a lot, and it doesn't have to try any harder to be a "typeface in its own right".

* You can see the "j" at the far right here: http://themicrofoundry.com/s_latin.html

** http://www.typophile.com/node/66461

That said, you do have a decision to make: how conventional or not you want this to be. You could end up with a solid, charming, somewhat old-fashioned design; or you could end up with something that will make people (including you) <em>think</em> a little bit (even though it might still <em>seem</em> old-fashioned). The strangeness in the "a" is probably the best example of what might or might not need to be happening.

This -very personal- decision has to come before any specific glyph critiques can really be worthwhile I think.

> 8 points its intended size

Although the ample width might point towards such a smallish size, the vertical proportions are more significant, and there (especially in the longish descenders) I'm seeing 10-11 point.

		<div class="commentbody">What a pleasure waking up to such praise! Thank you, thank you, Hrant and Ben. This really is the greatest encouragement. 

Hrant, this typeface originally had a 'j' very similar to yours, like this: 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_3_3605.png]

I abandoned that idea because it made the very usual (in the Nordic languages and in Albanian) digraph 'gj' close to impossible. 

I've never even heard of Bremer Antiqua, thanks for that link. I'm looking forward to studying that now.

I want this to be an original typeface rather than a conventional one. And I agree that my 'a' is the ideologically most important glyph. I'll start redrawing things as soon as possible, that will be in seven hours or so. 

Ben, I'm really looking forward to your critique. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well well! I can see you've had a lot of fun drawing this! I like the way you've balanced the variables: smooth/cuspy, sharp/soft, lively/restrained. It's very artful, almost every glyph has some unexpected delight! I especially love the Pagan-cross shapes of F and the 4, which is just incredible.

I'm having to go into the realm of vague suggestions since this is already so polished, so be wary of taking my comments too seriously.

A seems somehow a bit plain. I like the spur on the apex of your AE, wonder whether that would work on the A. Also the foot serifs feel a little flat/shallow.

B is perhaps heavy on the left, meaning add a fraction more weight to the arches. Compare with D.

Tail of C looks unresolved. And the tail of J may be an area to play with.

Q: This puzzles me. The overall shape fits well with the rest of the alphabet, but I'm curious whether there is a better solution for the tail. Crossing the bowl?

T arm-serifs look lighter than on E; I'd expect them to be heavier.

On U, I'd be tempted to try bringing the weight down the left slope more.

W: I think the apex needs a slightly wider top, but that would lift some of the weight there upwards, which would not look so great, so also lowering it a fraction might be the solution. In fact that right hand downstroke could do with a couple of units extra weight I think.

Lowercase

a, f, m, q, r, t and u are super. I'd personally agree that the flags of f and r could take more weight, but Craig's also right, see how it looks in text.

c is wide. Just an observation, I don't know what to think of it :)

Counter of d looks somehow oblong compared to the more oval ones in p and q.

e: yes. I'm a real fan of the inky eye, but I'd want an alternate for larger sizes, somewhere closer to the e part of /ae/ and /oe/. (I think these two may be too wide, and the vertical side to the counter of /a/ in the /ae/ bugs me. But I'd happily defer to your familiarity with these glyphs.)

g: I'm not accustomed to the narrow tail, and to my eye the terminal seems a bit far to the right, but I'd want to see how it works in text before recommending any change. 

h may be a bit wide, or not.

I'm curious about the placement of the tittles. 

I don't know how, but the w seems very much to bear your signature, it reminds me of your previous typefaces, which are actually rather different. I like the way you draw w.

Loving the shape of thorn! Diacritics may be slightly too large (but only slightly, I like the weight of them). Placement of acute and grave may be too central.

Comma may be out of character?

Section sign may be falling left. It's an absolute beast to draw.

I absolutely love the numerals, but some of them feel too sharp/crisp/stripped/modern. Like comparing the 567 with the glyphs in the line above, they sort of seem like a different tone. This is probably connected with what Hrant said about the strangeness. Is the contract too vertical on 5 and 6? I fear the 4 may be too wide, but don't change the shape please! Also I wondered whether you could curve the diagonal of the 7 into a swashy terminal like the 2 and 3. 3 and 5 may need more open lower bowls.

Well I hope this hasn't put you off by seeming like there's too much to do...it's been instructive to look so carefully at what works and doesn't work for me. Thanks for sharing! :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for yet another invaluable piece of criticism, Ben. Not offputting at all, rather the opposite. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rev1_5815.png]

Here's my very first partial revision. I've only concentrated on some of the most important lower case letters. More to follow.

'e' is now more related to 'a'. Have I've done the opposite of what you both suggested? Feel free to slaughter it. 

's' is a litter wider, slightly more "upside down" and slightly rotated and fattened, inspired by Bremer Antiqua. 

'd' was faulty, thanks for spotting that, Ben.

'g' is somewhat tweaked. I didn't quite understand your advice, Ben. Is this any better? 

'f' and 'r' slightly altered.  

'c' a tiny bit narrower now.

Except for the 'e' (and perhaps the 's'), these are all rather minor tweaks. Maybe I should follow Hrant's advice and think a lot more on this typeface before I continue drawing. Any way, all your input will be taken into account. Thanks again.</div>

I guess what I meant about g was that the bottom half of the tail wasn't quite long enough...I think it makes the whole shape look a little falling to the left, but that could also be because the top of the tail slopes quite a lot. The latest one feels more comfortable to me, but best seek others' opinions on this.

Thanks for liking the '4', Kevin. I think it'll be to the numerals what my 'a' is to the lower case. But some polishing is necessary, yes.

I just think any ideological decision is personal so it has to come from you; all I can do is try to help reveal the issue. Until you settle on the spirit of the design any specific glyph critiques risk becoming moot.

That last "e" fits with the rest. The troublemaker -in the best possible sense- is the "a". You might actually leave it that way - for a text font it's not going to jump out; it might even become a conversation piece (like the [in]famous "g" in Meta). Or you could tame it, get over it*, and polish the font away. The hardest thing -again, in the best possible sense- would be to let the "a" trigger a full re-evaluation of the font - perhaps even hibernating the design again...

* It's a maxim of sorts that -for a text face-
one must discard the most beautiful glyph.

I've however made the 's' more stable by moving its upper part five units to the right (back to where it was, but the new structure is kept). I guess one could say that the 'i' (and the 'l') is less balanced now, but the structure itself is now almost completely different too. What about the Bremer Antiqua if my glyphs are falling? Perhaps I've made a big mistake by doing this. When I've worked my way through the lower case, I'll upload a pdf with text settings. I think that will answer that question.

Lowercase s looks slightly too light now. You're right it is amazing how much difference a few units can make...quite a puzzle really!

I'm afraid I don't quite understand your suggestion, which glyph(s) are you talking about? 

Yes, I've noticed the light 's'. I think that glyph (and its sibling, the 'g') needs to be too a little light in this typeface, but perhaps I've overdone it. What would your approach to fattening it slightly be? Vertical or horizontal weight gain? 

No straight lines. That's a premise and a promise. </div>

New 'v', fatter 's', slightly tweaked 'i'. I'm still not sure if I understood your 'v' suggestion, Ben. 

About light 's's: Never really thought about it, but I think it has to do with overall colour. Complicated, curvy letters (a, s, g) may look blacker compared to simpler glyphs from a distance than they do up close. Don't know if this is really true, or just a hangup of mine. </div>

Glyphs are not vases - they don't risk falling down! This is especially true in a text face. Furthermore, imbalance can just as well mean dynamism, which to me seems part of the spirit of this design. A cobra isn't a cobra without that huge head. And a cobra is awesome. So I would be very wary of taming something like the original "s".

BTW, as you suspect, the "s", binocular "g", and any glyph that's dense <em>needs</em> to look too light when viewed large for it to work well at text sizes.

> No straight lines.

Assuming you haven't already, you might like to study the thoughts and work of Evert Bloemsma, who used to say "A straight line is a dead line" (although IIRC he got that from one of his former teachers).

I myself believe that balancing straight and curved is what's optimal. For one thing, death is a part of life too.

FWIW I don't see any "falling" that would be problematic.

The cap /R/ looks low-waisted, because the leg emerging so close to the stem makes the lower counter much smaller than the upper. 

Right (thick) leg of /A/: I would trim back the serif on the left (interior) side.

I printed the text setting on my mediocre HP laser and saw these weight issues, for what it's worth (I don't know if the problem resides in the design or in my printer resolution (or hinting?)):

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, your thoughts on glyph balance and weight distribution makes me happy. I'm a lot less experienced than you, but it seems we have drawn somewhat similar conclusions. Thank you for your cobra metaphor, I'll remember that. (I learned vector drawing from designing traditional Norwegian boats (descendents of Viking æra vessels, still built (in unbroken tradition) in the Western and Northern parts of Norway); their seemingly idiosyncratic hull shapes ("cod in the front, mackerel in the back") makes sense first when on water. I think a text face works much in the same way.) 

Yes, I've studied Bloemsma, and even sketched a couple of faces based on his principles, more or less. Here are some glyphs from one of them: 

 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_7_6484.png]

I now realise that this is the true beginning of the typeface this thread is about.

My decision to use only curves in this typeface is one I made only because restrictions fuel my inspiration. Also, this is my last typeface made for purely self-educational reasons. Next time, it's serious. No such rigid rules then. (A critic once said that Richard Wagner's music is much better than it sounds. I feel the same way about Evert Bloemsma.)

Craig, thanks for printing. I've adressed the issues you brought up. No more drawing today, but I'll start refining the upper case tomorrow. </div>

Interesting.
And I can think of two other type designer you might study: Starling Burgess and
Miles Newlyn. I know of the latter's interest in boats through his Flickr stream: http://www.flickr.com/photos/69998588@N00/5582002742

Well, if this is non-commercial then definitely
worry about ideology much more than salability.

Upper and lower case revised, pdf attached. Absolutely no kerning. Spacing still basic. Any thoughts on the letter fit? 

I've tried using the turning-contrast idea on several new glyphs, most notably 'v' and its siblings. (Is this what you meant, Ben?)

Hrant, all my typefaces are non-commercial, type drawing is just a hobby. (Though the most time-consuming I've ever had.) That <em>may</em> change, but so far, I haven't even once thought about salability.

The "g" is nearly ideal to me. I would make the ear rise though.

It would be nice to have a more forceful "j". Is "gj" that serious a problem?

The "m" could be narrower.

The "u" is wide. Probably because it's the same width as the "n"; it has to be slightly narrower to <em>appear</em> the same width.

The "x" is probably too dark.

The "E" is too wide I think.

The face-punched-in "G" needs work...

The leg of the "K" is too weak.

I would make the bowl of the "P" much larger.

That "Q" is way too timid; this font needs one with a <em>kick</em>.

The "R" is exquisite.

I would give the "S" a smaller head.

The "U" is luscious. Don't let people convince you to change it.

As in the lc the "X" is probably too dark.


BTW, looking at your body text I got this vibe that I hadn't felt in a long time. This design reminds me of Quadraat - not because of any formal attributes, but in the way it seems to say "I've been doing this for a long time - you can trust me."

Concerning the point size:
Looking at your setting, and comparing the vertical proportions and the width to some reference designs, I think it's best suited for 10pt, and can work at 11pt. (That's assuming your lc letters span nearly the entire EM.)

A appears slightly light, perhaps. One place you could add weight would be the crossbar, but this might not be the look you want. I tried this in my so far very underwhelming <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/5554664424/in/set-72157626167101796">Dutch Antiqua</a>'s A.

The tail of C still bothers me; I'm expecting a little more definition, maybe not as far as mirroring the top serif but something. Hm, not sure.

The stem of D seems light next to the large counter. 

I wonder whether an Emerson style Q would work here. (Top left image in <a href="http://typophile.com/node/76254#comment-439596">this post</a>)

Agree with Hrant about the lc u being a touch wide; however for me the G works beautifully.

I wonder whether z could have a spur or two on the serifs or even on its angles.

Looking forward to seeing numerals and punctuation. I'm still thinking comma and quotes are too modern looking, but I'm a stickler for commas! :)</div>

Bloemsma's ideal is nice, but the reality in digital fonts is that you're always having to cope with a grid. Lines that are long, flat, but not quite straight tend to rasterize with bumps and jogs that look like mistakes. 

It's fine to avoid straight lines as part of your design concept, but if a line wants to be straight — make it straight. Don't knock it three units off plumb just on principle.</div>

Slightly narrower (and weight-compensated) 'm' and 'u'. 'x' is lighter, and significantly tweaked. 'k' is slightly weight-tweaked. And I've made a working "æ", the old was just a leftover from several iterations ago. 

<cite>Is "gj" that serious a problem?</cite>

Oh yes. 806 words in Bokmål, 2967 in Nynorsk. Grammatically correct sentences with /gj/ in every word can easily be constructed. Very, very common in Icelandic, Faroese and Albanian too. 

<cite>[...] but in the way it seems to say "I've been doing this for a long time - you can trust me."</cite>

That is some compliment. Thank you! (I wish I felt the same way.)

<cite>I wonder whether z could have a spur or two on the serifs or even on its angles.</cite>

Possibly, I have doubts about both zeds, actually. Something to look into tomorrow. Along with numerals (the top terminals on 2 and 3 must go, mustn't they?) and punctuation.

I think your italic sketch is ok in itself, although I'm not sure how well it pairs with the roman. Maybe it's the axis of the contrast; slightly diagonal in the roman, but pretty much vertical in that italic sketch.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for commenting, Jelmar.

I've thought the same thing about the upper case myself. But isn't it always like that? I think this typeface needs some kind of serenity in its upper case, as so much is going on elsewhere. And it isn't that conventional, is it? I'd say U, J, G, R (and to a lesser extent the new Q, which no-one has commented on, by the way) are all somewhat progressive for a traditional text face. I tried injecting more of that contrast-trickery into the upper case alphabet, and found it lost character rather than gained. I think almost all upper case alphabets are less fun than their children. Unlike them, the adult letters have a unifying design and inner logic that needs to be there. 

I'll have another look on the 'g'. I'm very satisfied with it waist down, but the upper part may need something. 

Here's an ampersand, basic punctuation and three different question marks. Please help me decide with one deserves further development. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_9_5347.png]

Another thought: Not once while drawing have I been using historical models for my letters, or even looked much at other typefaces. All my previous attempts have been quite east to classify. But which category would you put this typeface in? </div>

New ampersand. I've tweaked it for countless hours, and have gone totally blind. Can this structure work? Is it wrong to adjust the arm to x-height? Is it too dark?

Revised question mark. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_10_6374.png]

I've been worrying a little about the colour difference between l.c & u.c. too. I'll keep that in mind. 

Hrant, The problem with the old 'j' is that no other glyph has kept its traits. Originally, f, g, r, y, j had that beak. Do you really think it could work all alone? Er ... perhaps it could be made to resemble 'g' and 's'. </div>

The question mark is a bit too smooth - it needs some of that funky modulation.

You may be right about the old "j". What about a Centaur-style one?

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you very much! That ampersand was a nightmare, but one I learnt a lot from. One structural problem with the ampersand is that it has to balance between upper and lower case, as it belongs to neither (or both). I tried to do that by combining the upper case cusp and diagonal with the lower case flag serif and v/k/x-arm. 

I'm quite satisfied with that my new ampersand has a rather conventional outline, yet still is structurally not so orthodox. One can clearly see a rather undistorted 'et', without the glyph being too cursive nor too "literal".

Your honest and very qualified critique is invaluable! I cannot imagine how I can ever draw type this good without Typophile. 

I think Centaur's j terminal looks like melting, brittle metal. That's cool, but not for my typeface. But I'll try to come up with a more distinct shape (though I quite like it as it is, I realise it might be a bit passive.)  

I think I need to do something else than drawing tomorrow. Stay tuned for updates in a couple of days.

That is one insane g, Sevag! Thank you. 

I've thought about making such an upwards-pointing spur on mine, by the way, but just can't get it right. Should I keep trying? By the way, what are good examples of typefaces with an open 'g'? I'm not counting Baskerville, it's aperture is purely ornamental.

Frode, nice of you to compile such a list! Personally I only find Ingeborg's to be good enough (although the one in Tarbeev's Bodoni is OK). Sindre's is better than any of those... although maybe I feel that way because it's structurally similar to the one in my own Patria:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/patria_lcg_4233.gif]

And Sindre, in fact the only thing I'd change in yours (which I mentioned before) would be to give it a rising ear.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you, Frode! I've been browsing your typeface list, and I have to agree with Hrant. Those g's aren't really similar to ours, they are all (even Ingeborg's) embellishments on the same old structure. Most of them treat the opening like the gap in a renaissance 'P', the stroke is continued, althoug there's no ink there. Our 'g' descenders are much more independent, and they have a terminus. 

Ingeborg (that I haven't at all heard about) is irritatingly similar to my unfinished Mondegreen, by the way). While it's a good typeface, I think it suffers from slighly sloppy curves and lack of attention to micro-detail. Enigma is good, too. 

It looks like the typeface from your list that has the most comparable g's to ours is ITC Italia. But the rest of it looks like a parody of William Morris' parody of Nicolaus Jenson.  

Hrant, your right (again), I've now come to think that an upwards-pointing ear is inevitable. </div>

That 'j' (slightly modified now) is a scythe, the question mark a sickle, and 'e' reminds me of some kind of blade my father, the luthier, uses for scraping the inside of a carved-top string instrument.)

Another thing I'd like to ask you: What adjective(s) would you use to decribe this typeface? I really should be thinking of a name soon ... </div>

I'm almost humbled by the adjectives you chose to describe my typeface, Craig. I can only say thank you. Those words certainly renew my inspiration.  
 
Trevor, Nordland is a bit too generic, I'm afraid. It's the name of the second largest county, and in Norwegian the name doesn't imply anything marine without -båt attached to it. Besides, my ancestral farm Bremnes is in Troms, which is the neighbouring county. My ancestors would rotate in their graves. "Ballast" would possibly be more suitable for a heavy sans serif, but still of utmost importance in those boats we're talking about. The [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Seilende_nordlandsb%C3%A5ter.JPG|large ones]] have up to two tons of round stones in them. It would be a nice double entendre, though. I'll consider it, really.</div>

(Though perhaps not to the same extent some of its connotations, at least not to the early Greek satyrs, as they were ugly, old, sex-crazed men with horse tails. In late Antiquity, they became much nicer and better looking, though.) Actually, I wanted to give an earlier old style attempt the similar sounding (but unrelated) name Saturn, but found out that was taken by some Eurostile copy. Also, my old nom de plume as a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causerie|causerie writer]] (and my earlier user name here on Typophile) was Satyagraha. Though yet again unrelated, I chose it for its sound and my associations to it (and literal meaning) rather than its political meaning. (Though I am indeed a fan of Gandhi's methods (and of Sanskrit, possibly the most beautiful of all the recorded Indo-European languages, especially in its earliest stage)).

Redrawn numerals. I've tried to continue the turning contrast in as many of them as possible.

		<div class="commentbody">I like most of them. The "3" is fine - maybe slightly plain. The "4" rules. The "6" and "9" are definitely a bit plain, and the "8" is way too regular and clean.

The zero: although I'm aware of the need to pull it away from the lc "oh", I've never grasped the benefit of the extreme monoline form. Flipping the contrast is one of the two tricks I'd recommend (especially when you consider that many numerals have flipped contrast anyway). The other is making only the left or right curve thick.

BTW, it looks like the "1" is heavy and the "5" is light.

That last update was a little uninspired and lazy. This is much better, though perhaps a little ovedone? Unsure about 69. 

About the zero: I really like the one thick side-zero (and have used it before), but I don't think it suits this typeface, it looks just too 1800. So here's a reversed and slightly rotated-zero.

That's kind of the point, no? For me this is a book face, where due to their scarcity, numerals can afford to have a lot of character. I would, however, suggest something with the lining 4 to make it more «capsy». (A foot serif for example.)

I'd say the lining 1 needs bigger feet, and the lining 2 to make the left side of the baseline join lower. I also think the lining figs need a bit of height normalisation. To me the 8 appears small.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, I'm overwhelmed by the number of comments after my last update. Thank you very much, everyone. 

About the '4': Yes, it is extreme. But keep in mind that this font is intended for 10 points. This typeface will have true optical sizes (not just text and display, but korpus (10 pt), cicero (12), mittel (14), tekst (20), kanon (36). I'd really like to use those traditional names, by the way, but that's something to decide much later), and the larger the size, the more refined and less boxy everything will be (and the curves shallower). I doubt the curve of '4' will scream excess! at 10 points. But yes, I know what to do, and that is thorough testing. For practical reasons, I must do all testing on paper later in the process. 

It seems my '4' (and to some extent the 'g') is a love it or loathe it-glyph. That tells me I'm doing things right.

Another thing: I begun drawing this typeface as a self-educational, strictly non-commercial one (I'm just a hobbyist), and won't think much about saleability during the drawing process. That may change, though. 

No time for updates today, but stay tuned.</div>

Or maybe it just needs more complex friends.
In Armenian for example we have half a dozen
characters of that complexity so none of them
feel lonely.  :-)

> Every open bowl g I've ever seen has caused a hiccup for me

Maybe because you're too type-aware? We know
that type designers can't really read anymore.  ;-)

Anyway I certainly agree that virtually all
open "g"s are poorly designed - because it's
a rare form it's harder to pull it off; the
closed form being established is easier
to get away with making it poorly.

BTW:
- The hiccup I believe can happen with the
closed form is especially when "g" is doubled:
the peculiar pattern repeated can be jarring.
- Have you read anything set in Patria?

ON THE OTHER HAND... :-)  I've always thought there <em>might</em> be a way to makes things really click between the two cases, specifically by leveraging uncial forms... Where's Victor Hammer when you need him!

		<div class="commentbody">Differentiating the cases has become a very conscious decision in the making of this design, I've actually exaggerated the differences, the serif treatment are different, the upper case has none of the lower case contrast weirdness. 

About my open g: It stays that way. I've come to think that the s and g, the two loners of the lower case, should resemble one another. That solves a lot of problems, and looks pretty. Harder to read? Not if you're used to it, no way. I think reading Fraktur is frustratingly time-consuming (and my mind often refuses to accept that the "k" is not a "t"), but I'm one hundred per cent certain no-one thought so 150 years ago.

Love the descenders of /p/q/.

That thickening at the joins works wonderfully at the bottom of /V/W/! /v/ is fantastic.

I wonder if top terminal of /s/ could be a touch less soft (maybe look to /f/ for a model).

I don't like the /h/m/n/.

/K/'s arm seems a little weak - is it stretching too far over, or does it need a little more black?

The /Z/, which seems to switch contrast strategy midgame, is no less daring than the /X/. Give us some words with those glyphs to judge.

Question mark seems too soft. At-sign may be too generic--could some contrast or quirkiness be introduced into its loop?

/A/ crossbar seems too high to me still.</div>
