  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Just wondering if anyone else here has any kind of typographic tattoos here. My first tattoo just finished healing, it&rsquo;s an ambigram of my last name &lsquo;bailey&rsquo; made to look like it&rsquo;s embossed into my back (kind of hard to see in this photo). Mind you I did this shot on a self timer so I was trying to point to it and get in position at the same time&hellip;I had been thinking about getting a tattoo for a long time but decided that I would only get one if I designed it and if it meant something to me.</p>
<p>This design became significant to me because of a) I designed it myself b) John Langdon told me it was one of the best ambigrams he&rsquo;s seen out of any he&rsquo;s ever been sent. To be complimented to this degree by the creator/inventor of such art form it humbled me to a great extent c) most importantly it&rsquo;s to commemorate my grandfather and father who do amazing carpentry wood work, when they finish a piece they brand their names into their work (initials and date usually). When I showed this to my grandfather (the ambigram) he was ecstatic and so what I did was get him a self inking stamp of it for his birthday. He has since marked all of his cherished books and such with the stamp and it was the happiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen him in the 20 years I&rsquo;ve been alive. I&rsquo;d like to remember that moment. I&rsquo;ve essentially branded myself with one of my most cherished designs.</p>

<p>I have some japanese and some hebrew tattoos. I did all of my own research to make sure the translations were correct.</p>
<p>You can find some great typographic tattoos on BMEzine.com.

<p>I know a guy who has a big &ldquo;calligraphic&rdquo; tatoo troughout his chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It looked nice and he was so proud of it that I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to tell him that the French in it was wrong :/</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, yeah I was talking to the artist while I got mine and he told me a story of spelling something wrong on a Hell&rsquo;s Angel biker once&hellip;but he had drawn up the tat for him and said &lsquo;Is this ok?&rsquo; and the guy ok&rsquo;ed the design but then later realized it was wrong. It was even the city he was from (the biker) oi&hellip;needless to say the tat artist was scared for his life, but the Hell&rsquo;s Angel realized that it was his fault and my artist got out alive haha. He&rsquo;s actually the guy giving the tattoo in the beginning of the show Oz on HBO if you&rsquo;ve ever seen that. My friend grew up with him so I&rsquo;ve been hanging out in his shop since I&rsquo;ve been in Manhattan.</div>
