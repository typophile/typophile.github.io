    working on. Too early to ID. Looks like he's working in Fontographer 3.something.
    RoboFog? And he's got one of those Emigre mouse pads.

    The problem is that the current font, Miller Banner, is so lame.\r\n\r\nJust kidding.
    \r\n\r\nThere were typos, now corrected. Sorry about that.   "

  body: 'Kent, that''s not correct. The "genius" award is a journalist''s shorthand,
    not used by the MacArthur foundation, [[http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.959481/k.2EF5/Fellows_FAQ.htm|as
    they explain here.]] (Scroll about 1/3 the way down.) So it''s either "genius"
    in quotes, indicating that it''s not the official name, or just the MacArthur
    Fellowship. '

    but also because Matthew Carter is such a great ambassador of type design. Always
    modest, gracious, well spoken, and knows what he''s talking about on a deep level.
    I remember when I first encountered him at TypeCon, I was surprised and delighted
    to discover that he is first of all a fan of great type, like the rest of us Typophiles.  '

    wonderful to see Matthew getting this honor. I was thinking that he was the first
    type designer to be awarded a MacArthur, but a perusal of the list reminded me
    that the first was Charles Bigelow (although he's described there as \"graphic
    designer\"). \r\n\r\nJohn\r\n"

    the Lance Armstrong of the type world. I might come to regret that silly comment.
    Carter looked incredulous at the time. Just another crazy fan he probably thought.
