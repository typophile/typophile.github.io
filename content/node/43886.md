  body: "I'm definitely thinking about it. It's mainly a question if we (my musical
    companion and I) find the time. I'll post it here, if we get something done. \r\n\r\nBy
    the way, our \"normal\" music can be heard at www.myspace.com/esperspace if someone's
    interested. Not much typography there though\u2026 ;-)"
