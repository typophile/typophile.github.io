body: I was reading something and it said when converting a typeface to bold from
  roman. You add the weight to the inside of the letter. Why is this? Why wouldn't
  you add it to the inside and out to keep from filling your counters?

  body: "Adding to the outside of the letter throws up problems because of maintaining
    consistent vertical dimensions (x-height, Cap height, ascender height etc) between
    weight variants in the same point size. For example you wouldn't want a bold word
    emphasised in a line of roman to jump in x-height. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, weight
    can be added to the outside of the letter but mainly in a horizontal direction
    e.g. stem thickness, which is why bold type (generally) sets a longer line than
    the roman.\r\n\r\nThat's the simplistic answer, I'm sure someone can expand on
    this in a more eloquent fashion."

  body: "There is no definitive answer in creating bold weights. When I do it, I add
    weight to both inside and out but it is not that simple.  The bolder the weight
    becomes, the more vital the shape of the counter becomes. Counters in bold weights
    are surrounded by enough black area that they become more prominent as shape,
    \ The figure-ground relationship is a delicate balance and of profound importance
    in type design. Simply adding weight is easy. Making the form and counterforms
    balance and serve each other, is the hard part.\r\nLetterspacing and glyph-to-glyph
    fit are also of prime concern. The negative shapes between letters must work with
    the counters and the forms. It is like juggling, you have to keep several balls
    in the air while you catch one of them then throw another.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Mostly because that way you can get bolder faster. And since darker fonts
    need (in fact require) less interletter space, less internal space is better too.
    Another reason is to avoid making the bold too wide.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have encountered
    one quantification of how much wider a bold should be compared to the roman: ~8%.
    This from that old Letraset font editing program - what was it called? I can't
    believe how shaky my memory has been getting lately...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
