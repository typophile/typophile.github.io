body: Experimenting with a wide thin sans. I'd like to take it to a few more weights
  and add more glyphs and language support, but would like the get the basic letters
  and numbers in their sweet spot before tackling anything deeper. Feedback is appreciated.

  body: Hi there, really like the shapes, i have my doubts in the Q in the terms of
    legibility, and the 4 and 9 seems to me a little narrow. I would try to to make
    the J wider. Gonna make lowercase??

  body: "Hi Satori, thanks for the tips. I had tried a different Q earlier, but it
    had worse legibility. I'll play around with it to see if I can help it, but I
    do like the unorthodox shape. I'll rework the 4 and 9, and now that I'm really
    studying it after a few days, I think the midline of the 5 is too high as well.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as lowercase is concerned, I was planning on repeating the capitals across
    the lowercase, perhaps as small caps. For some reason, I can't see attractive
    and wide lowercase forms, and the intent for the uppercase was mainly titling.
    I'll continue to evaluate and post updates here.\r\n\r\nConrad"

  body: "Instead of changing the Q, I would rather have a take on the J. When we tend
    to accept that I does not need to be widened to fit in an extended typeface, wy
    should J suffer from that? The horizontal stroke is already too much for a proper
    J. Maybe you could try to extend the J below the baseline with a curvature similar
    to the tail of the Q. As a consequence you might then also consider to give the
    diagonal strokes of K (down right only) and R. Which could be taken further of
    course. When this does not fit your original concept (too much curvature?) you
    might also consider to create two different designs :\u2013)"

  body: "I like it, generally! A few random observations:\r\n\r\nB suffers from the
    [[http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm|\"bone effect\"]]
    and needs to be optically compensated. Also the join of the two bowls appears
    too dark. (D could also use some similar correction, even if it's not as obvious
    there.)\r\n\r\nO needs more overhang.\r\n\r\nX looks slightly top-heavy.\r\n\r\nC
    has some strange curves going on, especially the top one. Also, it seems out of
    style with the easy geometricism of a lot of the other characters, and its terminals
    are different from G/S. (If that's intentional, what's the rationale?)\r\n\r\nS
    probably needs to be gone over curve-wise as well, doesn't feel entirely smooth
    and leans back slightly. \r\n\r\nDoes I have a thicker stem than the other characters?
    If so, why?\r\n\r\nWhy is the stem off-centre in the exclamation mark?"

  body: "Albert & Johan,\r\n\r\nThanks for the tips and links (very handy). I've been
    tweaking this face non stop since I posted it here first. Below is the current
    standing. I won't post the current state of the lowercase, as it will need a significant
    overhaul on a number of glyphs as I apply your comments to the uppercase. I feel
    that the current version of the C is much more inline with the overall feel of
    the face, and I will be changing the B (I expect the P and R are also suffering
    the bone effect) and re\xEBvaluating the J, K and R.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/round2-typo_6390.png]\r\n\r\nSatori,
    the numbers are for you. I've revamped the 8 & 5, and the 4 & 9 are both more
    fitting with the rest of the widths."

  body: "Quite pretty overall! The {g} strikes me as crooked, though. Maybe keep the
    descender more vertical at the beginning, and prune back the end a bit. The {s}
    and {2} are a bit flabby, maybe remove the plateau in the spines. The {S} doesn't
    have that problem, but the upper and lower bend are very different from each other
    \u2014 try giving it a more continuous curve. The {t} looks comically unbalanced
    to me. It'd keep its ascender and backward spur to a bare minimum, and give it
    a more grounded foot.\r\n\r\nLove the numbers and the {Q}!"

  body: This is definitely getting better. I wonder if those gaps particularly in
    the bowled lowercase letters should be bigger. They look a little tentative. The
    break from straight to curved in BDPR is too abrupt yet (maybe fixed in the lighter
    weight 2 posts back but not in the thicker just above?)
