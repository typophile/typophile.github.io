    marked in the Gien logo and the Serif of the G has a little barb on it.  sorry
    J.  \r\n\r\nAny other ideas?  Also for the second one? \r\n\r\nthx"

  body: "The little spur on the chin of the G reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/janson-text/|Janson]].
    I picked Janson Text, because the 'e' shape seemed closer. Obviously, the G has
    been made much bigger, so that the i could be linked to it as they did.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks Mike - that looks a bit closer. Bit it's still not quite perfect.
    Maybe it's cutomised... Take a look at the upper serif on the n - much more stumpy
    than that of Janson. \r\n\r\nmuch obliged for your help..."

  body: "I think I see that the serif on the n is not much like Janson, although I
    think the G is pretty close. Another G like this with perhaps a better n is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-galliard/|ITC
    Galliard]], although this G is not as close. Neither font has a flat top serif
    on the i, but perhaps we should consider that some customization took place.\r\n\r\nI
    think there are a few G's with the chin spur, beyond the two i have picked so
    far, but I am not thinking of them yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The lowercase letters of Galliard are indeed much closer - and I agree with
    you about the customization of the i. That elusive G is still there though. Thanks
    for all your thoughts.
