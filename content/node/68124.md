  body: I am pretty sure that it's Carnegie-Plain Regular, I noticed the double story
    "a" turns into a single story when italic, really interesting.

  body: Definitely <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/goudy+old+style/fonts/">Goudy
    Old Style</a>. (Alyissa, I've never heard of this Carnegie font, but if you look
    at almost all serif typefaces, you will see that characteristic.)

  body: "Carnegie by Swfte International (a free font.)\r\n\r\nSeems to be a copy
    of Goudy Old Style. Carnegie does not come with any expert sets. \r\n\r\nSo it's
    Goudy after all. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help, Alyissa and Mark.  :)"
