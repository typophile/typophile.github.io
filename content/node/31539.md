  atending look pretty stupendous. Typophile luminary Carl Crossgrove will be there

  times that might be relevant are: \r\n\r\n[ 1pm-2pm ] A program dscussing Calligraphy
  with Georgiana Greenwood, Thomas Ingmire, and Arne Wolf titled: 'State of the Art,

    Hamburg Koran of 1694, but I had to promise not to circulate them.
