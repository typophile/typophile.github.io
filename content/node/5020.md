body: Would anybody know these fonts? I looked up many fonts but could not get the
  exact match. Friz Quadrata was the closest I got for &#34;Chicken&#34;.... Or only
  &#34;C&#34; is in a different font?.... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37223.jpg"

  body: The one on the right looks like a heavy version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/albertus/mt/testdrive.html?s=Chicken&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Albertus</a>, but I could only find lighter weights on the web.
    The one on the left looks seriously distorted. Hard to say what it is.

    Medium</a> is close for the &#34;Chicken.&#34; Could &#34;Chic&#34; be a squashed
    Times?

  body: I think it is Albertus Extra Bold. It comes with the Hewlett Packard LaserJet
    font set. I can&#39;t find more info on the net, sorry. <BR> <BR>The &#34;Chic&#34;
    part is a distorted &#40;ugly&#41; face.
