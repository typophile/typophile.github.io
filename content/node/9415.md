body: Hallo,  <BR>a customer asked to typeset his book of poems, which contains also
  some introductory text &#40;several pages&#41;. What couple do you suggest?  <BR>I
  know he likes bold sanserif text for the titles.  <BR>The poems are long hendecasyllabic
  verses, Dantean tercet style, so no &#39;text in a sea of white&#39; effect. <BR>
  <BR>thank you very much <BR>m.
