body: "I'm working on an annual report for school and have been using Sabon Next and
  Courier so far. I like the feel of Courier but it's set width is pretty wide. I
  was wondering if there was a typeface with a similar feel that doesn't set as wide.
  It doesn't have to be a monoface.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm curious if you guys have any suggestions
  for a third typeface (a sans-serif) that may complement the two."

  body: "Being somewhat wide it's characteristic of monospaced typefaces.\r\nThe most
    known proportional typeface with a typewriter look is American Typewriter, which
    comes with a condensed style as well (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/cond/).\r\nBut
    there are plenty that share a similar look:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/typewriter/"

  body: "I like the unchanging line widths of Courier (gives it a very technical quality).
    Unfortunately American Typewriter does not share that same quality.\r\n\r\nHere
    is what I have thus far. Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_6570.jpg]"

  body: Andale Mono is my favorite monospaced font. It's not so much a complement
    to what you're already using, but it could be used in place of Courier. It's one
    of the MS core web fonts so you should have it. It's a sans-serif, and a bit narrower
    than Courier, so it has more of a coding than typewritery feel to it, and I don't
    see it used all that often compared to other such system fonts.
