  that many of these early gothics didn't have a lowercase counterpart, however, looking
  at the [[http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/rrk/specimen.php?type=Gothic&sub=Lineal&specname[]=Gothic%20Light%20Face&specname[]=Gothic%20Special&specname[]=Gothic%20Extended&specname[]=Gothic&specname[]=Gothic&specname[]=Gothic%20Condensed%20Outlined&specname[]=Gothic%20Round&specname[]=Ancient%20Gothic&specname[]=No%20133&specname[]=Octagon&top=lineal&folder=B_3_3A&text=RRK_B_3_3A_02.rtf&img=B_3_3A_Spec_02.jpg&count=2&countmax=9|Gothic
  Special]] it seems I could derive an understanding of how the lowercase might've
  been intended for the Light Face. My intention isn't strictly about revival \u2013
  maybe a re-interpretation? \r\n\r\nWhat other sources I could look at to understand
  how a lowercase could be constructed for this kind of gothic? (19th Century American
  gothic?.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated!"

  body: Take a look at type specimen books of that era. There are plenty of them on
    Google Books and Archive.org. <a href="http://www.garloo.com/atf_reference_books.htm">The
    1912 ATF specimen book is a good start</a> and if you have time try books from
    Barhart Brothers and Spindler and The Inland Type Foundry. BB&S has some of the
    richer books due to them flagrantly ripping off everyone else (flagrantly even
    for that era!).

  body: Great thanks for these, I'm getting an idea of how they might be... however
    I think I'd rather move away from that direction!
