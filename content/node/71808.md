  body: "Also, im doing my kerning in InDesign, but after I need to bring the finished
    type into illustrator so I can do an effect with the paths.\r\n\r\nMy question
    is, what is the best way to bring this text into Illustrator without illustrator
    slightly changing the kerning?\r\n\r\nIm going to covert to outlines in illustrator
    so should i just do all my kerning in illustrator and forget about InDesign?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    be consistent.\r\n\r\n\"HYNES\" needs work. The left corner of the \"Y\" has space
    (which looks good) and the space on the right is touching. The \"E\" needs to
    be a little bit further from the \"S\" and the same distance from the \"N\" as
    in \"JOANNE.\"\r\n\r\nWhy aren't you just doing this in Illustrator in the first
    place?"

    in the first place, which I did with this version.\r\n\r\nHow do you think it
    looks now?\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kern3_4384.jpg]"

    subjective, but I'd say that the Y should be closer to the H and N (maybe even
    touching) to minimize those large spaces with the goal being to make them all
    have similar visual weight.\r\n"

  body: "Ok so I know you got all the feedback, which is great! So I was just wondering
    why, you wouldn't first work the font and changes in illustrator and then take
    it into InDesign?\r\n\r\nthat's how I would do it, InDesign after all is only
    a layout programme...\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents! "
