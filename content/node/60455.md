  you guys give good advice and the standard of work here is generally high.\r\n\r\nI
  have been working on a rebrand for swfoulkesarchitects.com who have decided to recognise
  the names of both directors.\r\n\r\nOne guy is working overseas for the firm and
  one is handling business in the UK so by recognising his name they seek to clear
  up any ambiguity surrounding who's in charge etc.\r\n\r\nsee attached and let me
  have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJ"

    Is it John Doe-Photographer, or John Doe Photography. Personal preference is to
    opt for the later. \r\n\r\nYou state the word architecture in your thread title,
    why not use that? Also, are there other people working for them? It sounds like
    possibly they do, so they may not be the sole architects in terms of creating
    absolutely everything. \r\n\r\nMaybe don't state what those guys do, specifically
    (architects), but what THEY, as a company do (architecture).\r\n\r\nAlso, from
    a linguistic point of view, I find it more harmonizing to the ear. FolkeS Pickering

  body: "Everyone\u2019s advice thus far has been spot on. A reflection can be useful
    in certain situations, but generally should not be used as a \u201Cweight-bearing\u201D
    design element. For instance, a reflection might be appropriate in advertising,
    to make it look like a product is resting on a surface, but in this case the reflection
    should go unnoticed. The eye should just assume that the product is on a shiny
    surface. I feel a bit like a broken record, but to develop a strong logo, start
    with shapes/type, and positive/negative space. If you can make it work like that,
    then you know you have a strong logo. Adding color will then only enhance an already
    strong logo, not polish a turd. I like the suggestion of Franklin Gothic. Even
    Helvetica or Gill Sans or Frutiger would be better than Arial, although I think
    Franklin Gothic would be the best fit.\r\n\r\nFlaccid Penis \u201CR\u201D ...
