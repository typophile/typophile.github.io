  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello!

Been [re-]designing this logo for awhile. The firm is [removed by moderator]...and their focus is helping small businesses succeed, freelancers included. They are currently expanding, and developing an online presence....hence the need for a stronger logo. They offer:

-Consulting services
-Organizational psychology resources
-Analysis
-Efficiency standards
-Accounting
-Marketing
-Business management advice: growth, profitability, maximum efficiency

Everything targets small to medium-sized business owners. Their name is similar to the word 'innovation' for the fact that most of their ideas are copyrighted and unique. Very effective business management information, trade secrets. They're innovative, with the intent of using that innovation for the betterment of their clients. They like making things better.

I tried as hard as I could to come up with a logomark; no luck. I'm suffering from creative blocks. If anyone has ideas as to what a symbol could be, or might best represent from the above info, that would be lovely, and very appreciated.

So here's what I have: two different directions. I'd still love a logomark, but....type-only seems to be my best bet. Thoughts??

Please let me know what you think. Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">It needs more "innovation." What you have right now is just word(s) with little emotional attachment to the idea of innovation. What if you turn the last "i" upside down into an exclamation point? Be aware that such approaches have been done before so make sure to do a bit of homework and think about what would be the best way of creating a feeling of "innovation" without being cliché. And if nothing seems to be working, take a break, and later come back and brainstorm, throwing all your ideas (even the crazy and impractical ones) down on to a piece of paper. Then identify the top 2-3 ideas and start refining those into practical concepts.

Good luck.</div>

-Transformation
-Positive change
-Metamorphosis
-Inspire
-Hopeful

These are all qualities related to the work of [removed by moderator]. They help clients succeed.

So, my concept of what they do has changed a bit. Came up with this:

The butterfly is a bit too lifeless and the position seems out of synch and unbalanced with the letters. In fact the font is a bit lifeless as well. Must it be all caps?

Good job on capturing the qualities you want to represent in the logo! Think about how type could transform (or go from negative to positive) - try out some more of those qualities and think how you could depict them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I much prefer the previous version at 11.Jul.2009 10.44am. To me, it nicely illustrated the concept of going against the stream which is completely lost in the last sketch. As penn said, the mark should be a lot smaller in relation to the type. Maybe, the single fish could even work as the dot on the i in innovien. 

The type treatment still needs exploring, but I like the abstract fish shape - interesting.

Looking forward to see where this is going.

Innovien is a logo centered around new thoughts, helping clients succeed, consulting, et cetera. Does a ladder mean 'success' to you in any way? 

Perhaps the colors could be adjusted....darnit. :) I really liked this one. I'll see what inspires me from that example you linked to and get back to you [and everyone else] with any possible adjustments.
