  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I was looking at my TV screen the other day and what my Playstation was showing there and noticed how really nice [[http://typophile.com/files/ps3-menu-font_4772.jpg|its menu font]] was. After a bit of tracking and [[http://typophile.com/node/64596|with help of akira1975]] the font happened to be [[http://www.fontworks.co.jp/typography/family/rodin|Rodin]] by the Japanese foundry, Fontworks.

It is really pricey, over $200 for a single weight. Plus shipping and handling as the CD is the only delivery method. Plus it quite understandably includes hieroglyphics, which I do not see using in any foreseeable future. 

All this doesn't make its Roman letters any less nicer. So I had this rather dumb thought to try and create my version of Rodin. 

I fully realize how utterly unqualified I am for the task, and how monumental the task itself is, but (a) I am really curious to give it a try (b) one can't learn without trying (c) I am in no rush and have no other incentive except for the curiosity.

The question I have though is this. How "OK" is it to try and replicate an existing type ? Not pixel by pixel or curve by curve, of course, but more of having an ultimate goal of creating a similarly looking type. 

I am asking because on one hand there is Swiss 721/Pragmatica/etc siblings of Helvetica, and Rodin itself seems to be borrowing extensively from Akzidenz-Grotesk, but on the other hand there is [[http://typophile.com/node/56010|Great MyFonts Purge]] thread.

My apologies for the "noob" question, but I would really appreciate any insight where does the line go between copied/cloned and inspired/derived types.

Maxim, my bad. I knew that Helvetica had at least two other siblings. One was Swiss 721, but the names of others I forgot. Wikipedia had Pragmatica listed along with CG Triumvirate and Nimbus Sans, and I blindly copied the name from there. No offense implied.</div>

As you already have figured out, it depends on who you ask. And people will never come to a good mutual understanding on this since there is money and personal interest involved.

If you ask me, there are VERY many clones/knock offs out there in the market.</div>

Copy it right off the screen as a graphic, use that graphic as a template, and draw your own outlines based on that graphic. 

You are bound to make some kind of changes, one way or another...

1. What-is-it.jpg was drawn from FontBook, year 2006, page 139

www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/What-is-it-from-page-139.jpg

and is Neue Helvetica, 66 Medium Oblique (see page 139, right column)

2. What-is-it-2.jpg was drawn from the same FontBook, page 225

www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/What-is-it-2-from-page-225.jpg

and is Pragmatica Basic, Medium Oblique (see page 225, right column)

(Note: I will remove these temporary files in a few days.
Who visits Typophile later, will have to buy the FontBook.)

I did not speak of "the original Helvetica". I spoke of "the original" as opposed to "a clone". For instance, if someone places a banknote on a color copier and make a color copy of the banknote, then, in my terminology, the banknote is "the original" and the result of the copying process is "the copy".

For instance, in my terminology, "Nimbus Sans" is a copy (= clone) of "Helvetica", and "Nimbus Sans Novus" is a copy (= clone) of "Neue Helvetica".

In my terminology, "the original Helvetica" would be the very first design made by Max Miedinger in ca. 1957, just like "the original work" is the first edition or editio princeps of a literary or other work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>...  “the original Helvetica” would be the very first design made by Max Miedinger... just like “the original work” is the first edition or editio princeps of a literary or other work.

The original work of a first edition comes from a single manuscript made into a number of copies usually intended to be identical. 

The "original" of a metal type face intended for text and display, is not "one thing" to begin with so, it could not or cannot be copied to one clone.

		<div class="commentbody">> The original work of ... (original as adjective)
> The “original” of a ... (original as noun/substantive)

English is not my mother-tongue, but to judge from English dictionary definitions, "original" as noun and as adjective are semantically different in English. For instance, Webster's Collegiate, eleventh editition, defines:

original, adjective = "being the first instance from which a copy is made"

original, noun = "that from which a copy is made" (there is no mention of first instance in this definition)

So, the noun does not necessarily denote the first instance. Therefore, if someone makes a copy from "Neue Helvetica", "Neue Helvetica" would be "the original" (noun), although "Neue Helvetica" is not the first instance of Helvetica and hence not "the original (adjective) Helvetica".
