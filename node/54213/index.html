As a concession to convention, and bearing in mind that potential customers might not be as sensitive or artistic as you are, perhaps a bit less white space ... If you had a nice logo, almost like a chop stamp on a Chinese watercolour in the top corner, it would not detract from your wonderful designs or compete with them. Then some distinction between your details and the menu list of your work would be good. Perhaps even highlighting the relevant description from the list, by means of colour or tabbing would make the navigation easier.

Also, the usual threats at the bottom about copyright, copying, stealing your or your clients posessions would be good ;-)</div>

The links on the left weren't too clear as links to individual projects. I'd design a simple stark homepage from which to direct the viewer to thumbnails to see larger work or put the thumbnails on the homepage. Perhaps take advantage of the simplicity of lightbox technology to highlight the work.

This struck me as soon as I opened the window...would another font instead of Courier help? I dunno, maybe it's the look and feel, but Courier gives me the creeps and really feels like a student's website, IMHO. It's an odd contrast, given that your work is pretty polished.</div>

Not sure why courier gets a bad rap. It would take a lifetime to figure out the tangential effect fonts have on everyone. Which is why I go with the majority vote if there is one. Anyway, thanks! </div>

Re controlling fonts over Javascript: You're probably referring to the <em>@font-face</em> embedding technology? The problem with that is, as far as I know, it only works on a handful of browsers yet. So it's still good advice to stick with the usual suspects in terms of fonts. 
You know you can specify an array of fonts in CSS? So you could always specify Lucida Grande, plus some other sans to fall back on in case Lucida isn't installed.
Maybe also look into the new MS Clearview fonts (Calibri, Consolas, Constantia, Cambria, etc.) as options, they're quite nice for screen reading.

Btw, that nav.png doesn't seem to work. :-(</div>

I don't have a font specified as a back up for Lucida Grande so it may come up as Times on windows machines. I'm curious to see how it opens on your computers tho.

Here's a comment for work "under the hood" though; add at least a few META keywords and a META description. The keywords will just reinforce a little of your brand to the web machinery. And the description will give you more control over the presentation of search query results and make them look a little better. Here's a screen shot of your description for a search result without a META description in your code:

Congrats on the improvements you're making on your website.

One odd thing remains for me as I view it in IE7: some of the items have a drop-out white box behind them, while others do not. I suspect this is not intentional, but perhaps there is some rational that I don't perceive. (BTW, if you change it to make the items display uniformly, I strongly prefer showing the items without a box around them.)

I also have a suggestion for you: implement a tag for each of your menu entries so that when the cursor is over an item, a tag pops-up with a repeat of the information you currently show below the item after you actually click on the link. This will allow the viewer to decide if the item is one that interests him or her.

Would you mind showing me what the white box looks like on your computer by means of a screenshot? That is a nice idea about the tags, very considerate toward the user, but I find they get in the way a lot. 

and mk2, I am shy! ha. I will figure some copy out though. Should help warm it up a little. </div>

Here's another oddity, when I first open your site, the text is usually (but not always) displayed with a serifed face (see below), but once I click on any item in the list, the text changes to a sans-serif face as shown above.

		<div class="commentbody">HI SALISAE!
nearly shouldn't repeat it, but you're presenting some really nice work.
(gotta mention that i just created that account to answer on your request here!)

well, i agree with nearly any comment until here.
i'm really into reduced and plain sites for portfolio purposes.
i just think that your navigation wording should be re-thought.
to me tags like ”corespondance“, do not mean anything. and i guess for your potential customer neither. why not use the tagline in your project description as addition to the navi? like ”correspondance, book“ so i would know what i can expect?

i also think you could use some kind of thumbnail-overview site as home instead of showing your first work, so we can see what your capable to do at first sight!

>> i love love love the art works layout!!

AtoZ, I cleaned up the code and there shouldn't be issues on PCs anymore. </div>

I like PYROglyphix's suggestion of a thumbnail overview.

PYROglyphix idea is a good one, I agree. Shouldn't take too much to implement either. I'll keep you guys updated. Thanks so much :) </div>
