    aren't the descenders equal in length?"

  body: "Nice design. The tall numerals are a neat idea.\r\n\r\nI like the g, but
    I'm always the one who likes a distinctive g when nobody else does.\r\n\r\nThe
    s looks upside-down. I'd extend the lower left end some.\r\n\r\nThe way the N
    dips below the baseline works fine in the full capital but is too exaggerated
    in small caps.\r\n\r\nThe question mark doesn't really seem to fit the face."

    here is next version with mostly all of them incorporated. I was saving this g
    for cursive version .o)"

  body: Have you tried the new 'g' with the same top-right part as the 'q'? I mean
    with the little pointy-thingy. ;)

  body: Not yet, but I will certainly do, as soon as I'll get back to this typeface.
    .o) It seems like wise idea...

  body: Well. All the time, I'm surprised that nobody commented width of capitals.
    Are not they too narrow? I am starting to feel it like this, after couple days...

  body: Well, there are very few comments to begin with. The crit-boards are rather
    quiet lately.

  body: V X Y are too narrow, and some like C D H could stand to be widened slightly,
    but no, I don't think the capitals in general are too narrow.

  body: "Thanks for your precious opinions, I will surely incorporate that. Although
    I'm working with typefaces over 15 years, it's still quite hard for me to come
    with constructive critique. \r\n\r\nThe floating descenders were rather an artist's
    wish than a typographer's choice. Clearly a mistake as well as the VXYCDH width...,
    however the biggest issue in sans serif for me is always S, paragraph, question
    mark, cedilla and & (Et) sign together with numbers. Arabic numbers in roman alphabet
    seem like from a different planet .o]"
