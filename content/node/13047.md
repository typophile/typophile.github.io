  body: something like this is easy enough to digitize as a logo in Illustrator...
    unless they wanted a full font for identity purposes. If they want it badly enough
    for that, there are several designers who will do custom work.

    signage, check out the book \"Entrez: Signs of France\" (S Rothfeld & A Aciman,
    Artisan, New York, 2001). In fact many of the examples happen to be for charcuterie
    shops!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Strange indeed. But lovely in its own way. It reminds of 'Choc' (by Roger
    Excoffon?) in it's top-heaviness on the curved characters but it's also stencil-like
    on the 'A'... I also think it may never have been digitised.\r\n\r\n \r\nLike
    Hrants ref to a good book on old commercial signage, I would recommend Arnold
    Schwartzman's 'Designage' (pub. Chronicle Books, San Francisco 1998) for further
    reading."

  body: Hrant - that book was exactly what I needed for inspiration. I have decided
    to digitize the font and create the other characters that I will need. Thank you
    all.
