  body: Boy, if you merged a lot of T-26 fonts together, this is what would come out.
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/komunique/">T-26&#39;s Komunique</a>
    isn&#39;t it, but the logo may be a modified version of it.

  body: Pritchard is more Brody/80s style, whereas this  <BR>sample has early 90s
    written all over it.  <BR>Especially the &#39;S&#39; with its angled flat top
    and  <BR>bottom strokes and those typical &#39;M&#39; and &#39;E&#39;/&#39;C&#39;  <BR>shapes.
    An important trait of this face is that  <BR>all the characters are basically
    rectangles, and  <BR>almost all of the action happens within those  <BR>squarish
    shapes. <BR> <BR>I think Chesh was onto something. Somehow it  <BR>reminds me
    of early T-26 stuff too.

    Last time I saw that font was when working on BYU campus and SLCM. The only font

  body: It also wouldn&#39;t have surprised me if Margo Chase had done the logo, but
    the team isn&#39;t listed on her site, which means either she didn&#39;t do it,
    or she&#39;s ashamed of it, or she gets hired so much she&#39;s forgotten everyone
    she&#39;s worked for. <BR> <BR>Regardless of what typeface it&#39;s based on,
    I think it&#39;s a pretty cool logo, and not just because I live 75 miles from
    Sacramento. Actually, I have no affinity for basketball. If it&#39;s not hockey,
    who cares?

  body: You are too kind, particularly given that I didn&#39;t actually find the typeface
    in question, or even the designer. However, it is nice to know that I can still
    read minds once in a while. Musta been the pigtails.

  body: 'Cheshire - That sounds amazingly familiar. The programmer in our office is
    a LA Kings fan. He can&#39;t stand basketball, or any other sport for that matter.
    Except maybe foosball. <BR> <BR>Does Margo Chase do a lot of sports logos, or
    does she just do a lot of logos in general? I&#39;m sticking with my interpretation
    - that it is a combination of letters from at least the two fonts mentioned above:
    pritchard and narrowband &#40;and maybe another one for the R&#39;s, but I think
    that is just a modified R from narrowband.&#41;'

  body: 'I don&#39;t know that she&#39;s done any sports logos. She&#39;s done quite
    a bit of design for music, television, and film. She has, or at least used to
    have, a very recognizable goth style &#40;as opposed to how typophiles regard
    the term &#34;gothic&#34;&#41;. The notable clients I remember off the top of
    my head were Cher, the early-90s &#34;Dracula,&#34; and the television &#34;Buffy
    the Vampire Slayer.&#34; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an example from her website that
    shows the kind of work I associate with her &#40;at least early-90s&#41; style:
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10826.gif" alt="Margo
    Chase"> <BR> <BR>You can see here exactly why I thought it might have been her.
    Keep in mind, though, that she&#39;s had a number of staffers over the years.
    Early in my career, I worked side by side for a day sketching logos with someone
    who had worked in her studio, and his work was extremely similar to hers &#40;he
    favored extremely goth-looking monograms, as she did&#41;. So it&#39;s altogether
    likely that whoever designed the logo may have once worked for her, as I don&#39;t
    think she did it, or I&#39;d think she&#39;d have put it on her site.'

  body: I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve differentiated between the two words goth and gothic.
    I&#39;ve been bouncing the word gothic around in my mind lately and have never
    been able to reconcile &#39;gothic&#39; fonts with what my idea of gothic should
    be. I always want to say gothic when I&#39;m thinking of fonts that look goth-ish&#40;?&#41;.
    Why is that? <BR> <BR>And I can see why you went straight to her after seeing
    this logo - very similar indeed.
