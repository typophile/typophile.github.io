  have been trying to get a confirmed name on this font. I am somewhat certain a whole
  font exists for it because there are many similar logos from the same era, and because
  this was a digitally designed logo.\r\n\r\nHELP.\r\nYes, I am aware that it is super
  cheesy."

    other companies also?\r\n\r\nLooking at the link you provided tends to make me
    think that it is hand-lettering rather than a font."
