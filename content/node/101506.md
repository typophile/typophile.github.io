  body: "It's quite possible that Disney 'borrowed' from several styles to make something
    that is 'new'. I have heard from designers before who worked for them adapting
    other fonts to be Disney -unique versions.\r\n\r\nIt's a somewhat generic Art
    Deco look that I suspect is a composite of several designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    attitude indeed was -and probably still is- quite cavalier. Which is why I didn't
    last there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    anyone printing or using THEIR work.

  body: What Mike said. It could have started with an art deco style like those Jodie
    mentioned, then tweaked to match the Arts and Crafts theme of the hotel. The shape
    of the 'S' is similar to the [[http://myfonts.us/CR0Sol|Rennie Mackintosh]] type
    seen on other hotel signage. FWIW, the logo is usually in all caps, the faux small
    caps seems to be an alternate version.
