  body: "The more quirky fonts were probably hand drawn, as John suggests, but there
    are quite a few fonts out there that are quite similar.  Here are a few suggestions
    from House Industries that I use (www.houseind.com)\r\n\r\nCoop Condensed / Ed
    Interlock / Las Vegas Jackpot / Shag Exotica or Lounge\r\n\r\nYou might also try
    Font Diner (www.fontdiner.com) or Ray Larabie's fonts (www.typodermic.com)\r\n\r\nJH"
