  Has anyone seen this typeface in print before? It looks like it might be really
  dark, but I can't tell on screen.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I have the Font Bureau specimen, it looks great. I think Rolling Stone was/is
    using it. This is one that has been on my list for a while...

  body: "<em>Rolling Stone</em> has mostly used Elmhurst for headlines and display.
    I think it still shows up occasionally since the simplifying of the typography
    and the reformat last year. But I can't think of any instances of use in text.\r\n\r\nHave
    you downloaded the PDF specimen from Font Bureau's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Elmhurst|Elmhurst]]
    page and printed it out for yourself? Granted, that will not be the same as book
    production printing; but at least you can compare directly with whatever else
    you've been trying.\r\n\r\nMaybe Chris Slye will stop by this thread and chime
    in. He may know of some book examples and be able to steer you toward specific
    titles.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi there. Sorry I missed this thread the first time around.\r\n\r\nI made
    Elmhurst a long time ago as a text face. I didn't necessarily succeed, but I gave
    it a whirl. :) Funnily enough, <em>Rolling Stone</em> is the only place I've ever
    seen it in print, and they made very good use of it solely as a display face the
    entire time, for many years. Amazing.\r\n\r\nIf anyone ever spots it used for
    text, I'd like to hear about it. Font Bureau does manage to sell a few copies
    here and there, so I suppose it must be getting used somewhere!"

  body: "I think it's doing all the right things to be a text face. The fact that
    it's dark is congruent with its large x-height - you just have to set it a bit
    small (like 9 point). And it seems loose enough for smaller sizes too. Also, its
    descenders are nicely short, as are its caps. The fact that its most famous usage
    is for display says more about the user than the font.\r\n\r\nBTW, that \"a\"
    is one of my favorite forms. Blumenthal did something similar in his Emerson -
    although much of the credit for that should go to his German punchcutter Louis
    Hoell, who had cut a tellingly similar \"a\" decades prior in Bremer Antiqua.\r\n\r\nLastly:
    A comparable font would be Iowan Oldstyle, although its descenders are a bit too
    long and it might not be dark enough to match its ample x-height. On the other
    hand, I've always liked Iowan's caps - quite majestic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Erin, I just re-read your original post: I had missed the fact that you're
    choosing a font for a <em>novel</em>. Unless your novel can be set at a smallish
    point size you might like to find a font with a smaller x-height - I think Elmhurst
    will be less-than-deal at sizes typical of books. Tellingly, FontBureau's description
    of it recommends it for newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
