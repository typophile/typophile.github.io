  wordmark. The U-V-E is really bugging me and I've been looking at it for too long
  now. Hoping that a quick glance from fresh eyes might help. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.

  body: "I'm no big city typographer but I'd align the lettering to a grid, even keeping
    the spacing the same but reduce each letter slightly.\r\n\r\nVisually, the 'V's
    look like they hang slightly below the baseline which creates a slight wave to
    the lettering, when you hit 'uve' it throws it off symmetrically. It might be
    a case of staring at it too long."

    the \"V\" is a hair too dark.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Here's a slight update with the 'VE' + 'UVE' tightened a touch and the left
    upright of the 'V' slightly lighter. \r\n\r\nThe 'V's are flush to the baseline,
    although they do appear to be hanging below. \r\n\r\nAny more thoughts appreciated.

  body: V-E appears to be a fraction tighter. I'd loosen that and then I'd tighten
    VENEU by half of the first step.
