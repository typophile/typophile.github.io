  body: Good call on the B, was previously less wide... thanks, regarding the K, is
    it both lower & upper that you think do not work? and why exactly? Also - tittles?
    what do you mean?

  body: "Hi Richard, welcome to Typophile :)\r\n\r\nThis looks promising but I'd need
    a pdf to see up close.\r\nFirst impressions, this looks rather nice. \r\n\r\nUppercase:\r\nI'd
    agree the B looks wide, also the PR and S; narrow ones include OQTX and possibly
    W.\r\nCrossbar of G could be much more confident. J could be a bit wide, N perhaps
    a bit narrow.\r\n\r\nLowercase\r\nk needs some attention as Craig said. \r\nCurve
    on f and t could be wider.\r\nDifficult to scroll to the lowercase on this page.\r\n\r\nOther\r\n8
    looks narrow, 5 looks top-heavy, flag of 1 should be much more definite. Exclamation
    mark looks light. Octothorp is an unusual floating design? Asciicircumflex is
    way too high. Ampersand reads like a 3. Braces are out of character. "

  body: "\"tittles\" are the dots on top of /i/, /j/.\r\nI mean the lowercase /k/,
    which just looks too unconventional with the arm launching from so low on the
    stem. (By the way, I would think a font with this \"mechanical\" style might look
    good with a /k/ that connects with a horizontal line. Something like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bp_type_foundry/adam_bp_family_ot/|this]].)"

  body: "Looks good, but I'm not sure if it's 'different' enough. I agree with eliason
    about the i j and k. Here's what I see:\r\nK is top heavy\r\nB is top heavy and
    too wide\r\nG should be simpler\r\nJ is too wide\r\ns is top heavy\r\nm n u h
    are too wide\r\nx is too small\r\nZ is top heavy\r\nI think you need to redefine
    the width of a lot of the caps. With my expletus, I had the same problem. For
    me, Frutiger worked really well to help me do that.\r\nIMO the common mistake
    with geometrical typefaces like this is that they are too much based on geometry,
    ignoring the optical illusions. For example, the middle horizontal stroke in the
    B is exactly in the middle, but it looks like it's underneath the middle, which
    doesn't add to that geometrical feeling. Look carefully at all glyphs with a blank
    mind, forget about the numbers, trust your eye and change accordingly.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps. I'm not a professional so feel free to disagree.\r\n"

    have all this feedback, and will only lead to making this a better face in the
    end. Oh and glad you dig the shane type recut, it was for a jewelry franchise
    in the US... i cleaned up their existing design from the 1950''s... '

    all that I can see, plus some other details.\r\n\r\nThe /at/, /exclamation/, /parentheses/,
    /curly brackets/,slash on the /$/, /percent/, and the /i/j/ dots all look too
    light to me. Also, /at/,/parentheses/, and /curly brackets/ look like they belong
    to a different font.\r\n\r\nAfter you can consider all the recommendations and
    post some new samples, I'm sure we can give a few more tips, although all that's
    left is final tweaks regardless."

  body: Thanks Brian, regarding the { } and @, agreed, they do feel disconnected,
    I get that, but I don't want it to feel too mechanical, this adds some warmth/human
    hand and whimsy into the mix.

  body: I think you should increase the overshoots slightly, especially on the top
    of round numbers (2, 6, 8 and 9).  I know a lot of people don't like overshoots
    on squarish fonts, but to me your rounder letters look too short.  It makes D
    hard to decide what to do with though!.  Curve on bottom of g should be squarer
    like the curves in the rest of the font.  I'd also consider a tail on lower case
    l.

  body: "To my eye, the lowercase seems narrower than the caps, overall.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in the boldface, you need a bit more optical compensation (narrowing) at the joins
    of curves to straights. It's ~ right in the regular weight, but you could do a
    little more in the bold.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
