body: "Just found this site that claims to be the Wikipedia of typography. You can
  look up fonts, learn about typography, get involved in forums, Add your own fonts
  and knowledge. Looks like it\u2019s pretty early days and there are plenty of holes
  in the content but you can get an idea of what it is going to be about.\r\n\r\nhttp://typedia.com\r\n\r\nAll
  seems to be stuff that Typophile does in some way other.  To me it seems a little
  ill-conceived what does everyone else think? The search tools are not as good as
  something like myfonts.com, the forum will need to work hard to beat Typophile and
  the type info doesn\u2019t seem that great to me.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone else
  think?"

  body: all the best to them. Hope it won't get to be another sewer full of mis-information
    and branding schemes like Wikipedia became.

    know what a Wiki actually is? (hint: You can fix any mis-information you find)"

  body: There are some really smart and talented guys like Jason Santa Maria behind
    http://typedia.com. It is a pretty new project, I am sure that this will become
    a good resource.

  body: I think everyone would like it to be successful, but it has been around since
    2006 (according to the (c) notice) - when you need to know something about a particular
    subject, where do you go first? For me its usually Wikipedia - for fonts its usually
    MyFonts.

  body: Thanks Kent, that's from 2009. I wonder if the 2006 is a typo, or if it had
    a very long beta.

  body: "I believe Typedia is/was a pet project of designer Jason Santa Maria. A labor
    of love that percolated for a few years before it finally went live.\r\nI'm guessing,
    but he probably had the domain name and the concept for those years, hence, 2006-2010.
    (I'll ask along the way.)\r\n\r\nTypedia has yet to find its niche - but as type
    and typography and awareness of both on the web grows, I think it will ultimately
    find one."

  body: I wonder if closer alignment with the foundries via cross-linking might result
    in more traffic, more content, and more mind-share?
