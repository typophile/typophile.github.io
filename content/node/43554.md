    use of our custom type services. Recently completed projects include 'Mylius Sans
    Headline Extra Bold' for British Airways.</em>We've also recently helped the people
    at Dyson develop a custom font from their logo<em> and we've reworked much of
    the London Underground typeface family, 'New Johnston TFL', making it more suited
    to modern computer environments.</em>\r\n"
