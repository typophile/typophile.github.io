body: I was very excited to see that this week's New York Times Magazine has a big
  article about the development of Don Meeker's and James Montalbano's ClearviewHWY
  typeface, available <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/magazine/12fonts-t.html?_r=1&ref=magazine&oref=slogin>here</a>.
  (For now, I don't think you have to be a NYTimes subscriber to read it, but that
  may change in the next few days.) It describes the problems with FHWA Highway and
  how Clearview offers improved legibility from a large distance. It also has a brief
  section of typographic terminology and sans-serifs. I thought it was pretty interesting
  and typographically-sensitive, although a good deal of the stuff on Clearview can
  be gleaned from its <a href=http://www.clearviewhwy.com/>website</a>. There's also
  a <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/08/12/magazine/20070812_CLEARVIEW_index.html>highway
  sign slideshow</a> with some images not in the article.

    Clearview actually reduces the distance to your destination by half."

  body: Whoops. Should have taken my own advice and searched first. I now know better
    than to underestimate the timeliness of the Typophile community.
