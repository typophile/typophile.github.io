  an existing typeface to import in your own one. I know it must need adjustments
  and it isn't something good but just wondering.\r\n\r\nwill appreciate any comment
  on this,\r\nthanks!"

  body: The trick would be to find a typeface exactly like yours. Clear sailing after
    that.

    sort of\u2026manual! Perhaps one could even be written about a specific piece
    of software, and given away for free at the web site of the company that makes
    the software!"

  body: Would be really nice something like that - can be tricky but maybe with some
    adjustments could be good! Also for learning how to kern.

    in your font, Edit - Paste Special\r\n\r\nYou can paste the side bearings or kerning,
    I think there are a few other options as well."

  body: Yay! It works! Also I figure out that you can save classes and/or Features
    and import into your own - but I don't think this is good!

  body: 'Another option: export an AFM file (from the Preview/Metrics Window), then
    import it in the other font. This has always worked very reliably for me, even
    in MM fonts. It also gives you further options.'

  body: 'Sounds to me like a pretty lazy and ethically bankrupt plan, extracting and
    using metrics and kerning from someone else''s font. You should learn how to do
    this stuff the correct way. '

    proposes! I'm not making any money with my fonts!

  body: There's tons to learn from it. First of all you get an impression of the general
    approach, and you also get to see how they solved tricky characters. The tough
    spots in your own typeface will become more evident as well.
