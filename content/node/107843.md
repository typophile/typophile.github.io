  body: "I'm now positive, thanks to a [[http://www.presseportal.de/bild/58622-logo-pressemitteilung-scholz-friends-group-gmbh.jpg|better
    sample]], that's surely Legacy Sans. The ampersand is definitely something else
    (Legacy one [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/legacy-sans/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/539149/7|here]]).
    Looks like they played with a /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/legacy-sans/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/539149/85|t]]
    and a mirrored /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/legacy-sans/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/539149/20|3]]...\r\n"
