  know what this one is?  \r\nMy best guess was Zurich Extra-Extra Light, which I

  body: The letters and numbers sure look like Folio Light, but that's also too heavy.  All
    you'd need to do is align the crossbar of the 4 with the baseline of the other
    letters....

    - font-purchasing is becoming more and more like baseball card collecting, except
    that trying to get lucky on a single pack of Linotypes would still cost, like,
    a grand.  "
