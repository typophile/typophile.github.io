body: "Hello. This is my first post here, pardon for my bad english.\r\n\r\nI am working
  on a logotype for \"the darth vader heritage foundation\" (student project).\r\nThe
  brief talks about vader as a \"tragic hero\". This is most important guideline to
  build the logotype.\r\n\r\nI have built 2 versions of the word \"anakin\" (both
  were once garamond regular) - one for the more \"formal\" side of the institution
  and the other for the dark process vader had gone through to become the dark lord
  and become my tragic hero.\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments."
