  night &#34;Digikana&#34; event at TypeCon San Francisco. And while we&#39;ve been
  doing our best to amass a pile of tunes that will please the discerning typographer,
  we&#39;re left with a question: <BR> <BR>What are the must-have tunes to please
  a Typecon crowd? <BR> <BR>Mind you, I&#39;m not fishing for &#34;what&#39;s your
  favorite song?&#34; here - I&#39;m looking for specific songs that mention type,
  alphabet, fonts, letters, etc etc.  Spoken word or musical. <BR> <BR>Any links to
  downloadable MP3s of typographers speaking &#40;or something similar&#41; would
  also be welcome here.  <BR> <BR>thanks- <BR>jb'

  body: 'Something Spanish &#40;and I mean Spain&#41;: &#34;Carta de Amor&#34; by
    Los Manolos &#40;on their &#34;Pasion Condal&#34;&#41;. <BR>It&#39;s a reading
    of a love letter where they speak out the punctuation too. It&#39;s sort of a
    loungy track &#40;they specialize in Spanish-Sinatra-style, actually&#41;, but
    pretty cool, I think. I can bring the CD with me if you like. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
