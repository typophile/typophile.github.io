  something that I made years ago and released for free. It's based on another more
  grid-oriented font I made earlier called Rutager.\r\nAnyway, it's riddled with flaws,
  yet it still has a certain charm to it that I feel like revising it in to something
  usable, possibly marketable. What do you think?\r\n\r\nFont files are available

  body: It's color is interesting but my gut is that a new sketch would be a better
    place to start even if you were going to channel this feeling again. From my experience
    ( limited indeed ) and what I have been told it's often faster & better to make
    a face well straight off than to fix 10,000 errors. Look at all the weight problems
    for instance. This is putting it a bit too simply perhaps. And it also depends
    on where you think you were then & where you feel you are now. There is also the
    question of purpose. What purpose whould you be designing towards with this?
