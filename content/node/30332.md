  circa 1990.\r\n\r\ni've attached a sample of the some of the characters from a scan
  of a poor quality print of a screenshot - that's all i have available.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amigafont_6208.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nnote
  baseline serif on the \u201C1\u201D and the curvature of the vertical spine of the
  \u201CE\u201D and \u201CF\u201D characters.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nroland\r\n"

    and search using \u201Cmatrix\u201D.\r\n\r\nSomeone else may have more knowledge
    of typefaces used by Commodore back in the day."

  body: Since there are so many dot matrix fonts, you might want to find an Amiga
    forum somewhere on the net, some Amiga-fan will probably know the name of the
    font, if it was widely used.

    a dot matrix font as suggested"

  body: "True, however when I searched for 'Amiga system fonts', I came up with a
    lot of sites containing bitmap fonts for the Amiga system(s). Maybe theres one
    available that looks similar.\r\n\r\nBut you're probably right, sii, that this
    is more likely a dot matrix one."

  body: Sorry that's not even close - the C is open in that font, it's closed in the
    scan above,a nde E and F are completely different.
