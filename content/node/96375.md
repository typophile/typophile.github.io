  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari|here]], neither [[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sanskrit_Grammar/Chapter_I|here]].\r\n\r\nI
  also noticed that the diacritics U+0945(\u0945 - Devanagari Vowel Sign Candra E)
  can be used after consonants, like \u0915,\u0916,\u0924,\u0925,\u092A,\u092B as
  follows : \u0915\u0945,\u0916\u0945,\u0924\u0945,\u0925\u0945,\u092A\u0945,\u092B\u0945,
  but those links do not make any reference to this sign.\r\n\r\n Would appreciate
  some help on this. Thanks."

  body: "Not all languages that use a script use all the characters in that script.
    Some orthographies recognise more vowel sounds than others, so it isn't uncommon
    for a script to pick up additional symbols as it is adopted by speakers of additional
    languages. Also, sometimes a script will provide for writing of foreign loan words
    that include sounds not native to the languages that use the script. However,
    as you have found, more easily available information about the script in English
    will tend to favour either the original language of the script or only majority
    languages, and will tend to favour native use of the script. So, for example,
    \u0911 represents a sound that is not native to Sanskrit or Hindi, but that may
    occur in English loanwords (I believe the same may be true of \u090D), but this
    information may not be provided in sources discussing native use of the script.\r\n\r\nI've
    seen them both referred to as 'non-standard letters of the Devanagari script',
    which is a bit unclear: I think what it means is that they are non-standard in
    any native orthography of the script, i.e. they are not included in the repertoire
    of letters in the alphabet. Think of them as being akin to something like \xEF
    in English: it is not included in the alphabet and is not a standard inclusion
    in English orthography, but may be used in the writing of e.g. 'na\xEFve'."
