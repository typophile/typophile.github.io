  \"The finding suggests that New World people developed writing some 400 years before
  their contemporaries in the Western hemisphere\" doesn't seem to add up.\r\n\r\nMy

    like other mesoamerican writing.\r\n\r\nI think it probably says \"Hunahpu: shut
    the gate when you get home.\""

    Is he gonna blame the Mayans for all the world's wars next?"

    to Mayan. I just can't see much pictorial resemblance from the images....\r\n\r\nOh
    wait, I missed your first link. That one does show glyphs that are very similar
    to Mayan."
