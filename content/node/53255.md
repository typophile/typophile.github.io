  body: A colon is a 'stop', just like a comma, a full-stop or a question mark and
    should sit on the baseline accordingly. Ask your client if she would suggest centering
    a semicolon in the same way.

    But since she's paying, she can have it any way she wants -- even sideways. Anything
    to differentiate yourself from the competition.\r\n\r\nIf she gets fussy (just
    using a baseline shift to \"center\" likely will make the \"top dot\" too high),
    you get to make up a new colon & further differentiate your ability & services."

    that includes a colon, I baseline shift the colon to raise it. For extended upper+lower

    begun to include a \"caps colon\" in the character set? One that centers on the
    cap height and does not need to be raised?\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: The illustration of a colon in Bringhurst shows it clearly on the baseline.
    Of course, if the client won't accept using the colon as the type designer put
    it in the font, I doubt that Bringhurst will sway them.

  body: "Well, at some level, it all a matter of convention. Why does any letter --
    or punctuation -- look as it does? You can go back to scribal writing and find
    periods that are centered. If you look at the 42-line Guttenberg Bible (1455),
    the colon is on the baseline (except there was no \"baseline\" with metal type.)\r\n\r\nPressing
    on, the Cicero : <cite>Letters,</cite> printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz, Rome,
    1470, have a more-or-less \"centered\" colon. However, the <cite>Letters</cite>
    printed by de Spira, Venice, 1469, show a \"baseline\" colon. Of course, both
    of these printers were German, but moved to different cities in what is now Italy.
    \r\n\r\nNoinus : Peripatetica, Jensen, Venice, 1476, seems to use a baseline colon.
    \r\n\r\nFroissart : Chroinques, de Tournes (Lyons, 1559) uses the \"centered\"
    colon.\r\n\r\nBy in Large, the vast majority of printers used a \"baseline\" colon.
    But if you want to find a few instances of the \"centered\" colon, you can.\r\n\r\nSo
    your client is passing strange, but not completely wrong, unless she is using
    a type where the type designer decreed a baseline colon. The answer is simple:
    change typefaces.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    abundantly clear from what they say that some commentators on this topic have
    either never worked in a media agency or not worked in a position within a creative
    agency that takes its business seriously.\r\n\r\nIf the client represented a multi
    million dollar account they would have already signed the work contract and agreed
    in advance to pay in full all amounts charged to their account incurred as a result
    of demands made by them. It says so in the work contract, and their account manager
    signed it. If the job itself is worth millions the extra $1000 I'd be charging
    for a custom colon should easily be within their budget.\r\n\r\nIf the client
    is smallfry they need me more than I need them, so they can walk. It's probably
