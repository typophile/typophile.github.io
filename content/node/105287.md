body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nIn september i'm starting as a first year student in graphic
  design at the KABK, The Hague. I've been taking these two months of vacation to
  prepare and read as much as possible on Graphic design but more in particular about
  typography witch is where my interests really are.\r\n\r\nI do have a few question
  concerning about making a ready for print .pdf file and was hoping i could get some
  explaining, here i go:\r\n\r\n- for example i have just finished a 10 page booklet
  (as exercise to better understand Indesign) I would like to print this booklet but
  not quite sure on how to deal with the colors i'm using...i have placed some text
  in a Pantone color, is this ok or should i convert all pantone colors to either
  RGB or CMYK for print.\r\n- How can i check in Indesign if i'm either using RGB
  or CMYK color and for example if there is a color swatch in RGB how do i convert
  this color to CMYK?\r\n\r\nType related question:\r\n\r\n- I have been making some
  type specimens with a typeface i bought a few weeks ago, its kind of the classic
  type specimen compared to this  (Link)\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/miller/\r\nI
  have some trouble with getting the leading just right, i use different type sizes
  for each text line and every line is set in either italic, caps...etc. Is there
  like some kind of trick or useful tip/ calculation on how to make the leading just
  sit right when using different sizes. \r\n\r\nHope i'm not asking for to much here
  and that someone finds the time to help out a bit.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPatrick"

    print, you should either make everything CMYK swatches (conventional four-color
    printing uses only Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK inks), or \u2014 if you're
    using only a couple of colors, you can use Pantone swatches, which represent flat
    spot colors that will be mixed specifically for the job. For instance, if your
    whole brochure is only in black and red, you could use a Pantone red, which would
    then mean your printer only needs two passes to print it instead of four.\r\n\r\n\"How
    can i check in Indesign if i'm either using RGB or CMYK color and for example
    if there is a color swatch in RGB how do i convert this color to CMYK?\"\r\n\r\nDouble-click
    on the swatch in the swatches panel. A dialog window pops up with a menu for what
    mode the swatch is. Switching it to a different mode will automatically give you
    the closest equivalent.\r\n\r\n\"Is there like some kind of trick or useful tip/
    calculation on how to make the leading just sit right when using different sizes.\"\r\n\r\nNo.
    Trust your eye. InDesign uses a default leading of 120% of the type size (you
    can change this default), but this isn't necessarily the best for every font at
    every size."

    the pantone swatch to CMYK, i tryed but not quite there yet, i must be forgetting
    something\r\nI double click on the pantone swatch (Pantone 1788C, color type is
    set to spot) and the color mode is set to LAB (L=54, A=74, B=47). For some reason
    i cant change the LAB mode to CMYK, could you please tell me how to do it. Tryed
    looking it up but can't really find a straight answer (or maybe i'm reading over
    it).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just tried this.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Color Mode\" menu, you should be able to
    change it from Pantone to CMYK. Then you can change \"Color Type\" from Spot to
    Process.\r\n\r\nNot sure how you ended up in Lab mode. I've never used this mode
    and I'm not sure what you would use it for. But you should still be able to switch
    it to CMYK from this menu.\r\n\r\nEdit \u2014 James beat me to it. His instructions
    should work fine for you."

  body: ">  should i convert all pantone colors to \r\n> either RGB or CMYK for print.\r\n\r\nAs
    Joshua said, if there are just a few colors, you'll get best results with spot
    colors. If the job just has 2 colors, for example, the printer uses 2 printing
    plates, each printing in 1 color.\r\n\r\nFor jobs with numerous colors, it is
    usually too expensive to use a separate printing plate for each color, so instead
    the printer uses 4-color process. Colors are converted to screen tints of 4 colors
    (CMYK -- cyan, magenta, yellow and black) and the job is printed using 4 printing
    plates. Look at color photos in a magazine through a magnifying glass and you'll
    see how CMYK simulates different colors.\r\n\r\nIf you set up your file wrong
    (like using spot colors instead of CMYK), a good-quality print shop should catch
    the error and fix it, but a shop that specializes in doing things quick and cheap
    might not notice. It's always safer to make the file correct before you release
    it.\r\n\r\nTo change a color, change LAB to CMYK, then change SPOT to PROCESS.
    If you're having trouble changing a color, it's possible that the color belongs
    to a graphic you've imported. In that case, open the graphic using the appropriate
    program (Photoshop, Illustrator, or whatever) and change it to CMYK. Then save
    it and update the link.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_6543.jpg]"

  body: I think there's also a way to change all the colors at once using Ink Manager
    (found in the flyout menu on the Swatches palette), which would be useful if you
    had a huge list of colors to changes.

    idea how i ended up in LAB, i must have deed something wrong i guess, only i don't
    know what...:-D\r\n\r\nI appreciate all the help and time you guys took to help
    me out! Hope to return the favor in the future.\r\n\r\nHave a good one,\r\nPatrick"
