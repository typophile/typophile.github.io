  emptyhanded. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help! <BR> <BR>&#60;img&#62; <BR> <BR>&#40;<a

  body: Yves, thanks for your reply. <BR>It comes amazingly close. <BR> <BR>the &#40;italic&#41;
    weight in the sample is much heavier than those available. I suppose it could
    be a custom skew. <BR> <BR>bedankt!

  body: Aw man, what a beauty! Barry Deck is top of my list. <BR>He&#39;s treading
    that fine line between type design and  <BR>graphic design with his type designs.
    I want an  <BR>open-minded client <i>NOW</i>, so I can purchase a license  <BR>for
    that beautiful face. &#40;Now that would be a lousy  <BR>pick-up line if y&#39;ask
    me <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> &#41; <BR> <BR>Graag gedaan. <BR> <BR>P.S. Always scroll down the list
    <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif" border=0>. Actually,
    that&#39;s  <BR>something that would happen to me too.
