  occurs when I want to print a document from indesign. \r\nAny document containing
  text or vector graphics will be printed as bitmap and therefore any printout through
  indesign or illustrator is wothless. However if I export the document as a pdf and
  print throught pictureviewer the output is fine. Strange indeed. Adobe reader also
  printed out in nice quality but it took forever. \r\nI am wondering if this could
  be a ram issue or if it could be related to the fact that cs2 currently is not prepared
  for the Intel macs.\r\n\r\nMy setup is iMac Intel 512 mb ram. \r\nThe printer is
  a Brother HL-2070N laserprinter.\r\n\r\nHow to solve this...\r\n\r\nMKSG"

    printer descriptions/drivers for your printer?

  body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to answer.\r\n\r\ndberlow>> \r\nThe
    problem is that Indesign and illustrator doesn't print my documents right. The
    fact that Pictureviewer is able to print it right is ok because it means that
    I can print but it also adds to makee everything more confusing.\r\n\r\nI have
    all the correct drivers installed. Been throught that process a couple of times
    just to make sure. \r\n\r\nI got some more ram yesterday, so now it's 1.5 GB which
    surely speeds the things up but does nothing about the printing... I kind of figured
    it would have to be something else anyway. \r\n\r\nIn Indesign I have the choice
    of saving as an Adobe postscript file through the print dialogue and I can select
    the correct ppd but I cannot choose a ppd when printing.\r\n\r\nIn illustrator
    theres a checked box in 'print as bitmap' under the advanced tab in the print
    dialogue. It's grey and cannot be unchecked.\r\n\r\nThis is very frustrating.\r\n\r\nHope
    to find a solution soon before I go mad\r\n"

  body: "It sounds like it's the driver not handling postscript. PDFs printing correctly
    would indicate it's the driver. \r\n\r\nPictureViewer is a Classic application.
    If you're running OS9 then your driver isn't loaded... it's in Tiger's system
    folder... are you positive you've loaded the OSX driver? I don't know why you
    would have Classic running at all, or why you would transfer your CS app output
    to print into Classic... ?  Go to System Preferences and keep Classic turned off.\r\n\r\nIf
    you've already confirmed by the Printer Setup Utility that the driver is configured,
    here are a few threads from the Apple support forum on your printer. You may find
    some good info here. \r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=1882798&#1882798\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=2498739&#2498739\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=1950081&#1950081\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=2440569&#2440569"

  body: "Hi all, thanks again for all your help.\r\nSadly so far nothing has solved
    the problem.\r\nIt does not matter what kind of document I try to print everything
    comes outas bitmap. Pixelated. I can change the printer resolution to print in
    1200 dpi and then the pixels become a bit smaller but still bitmap.\r\n\r\nI don't
    think it is a os9 classic thing. It does not run on intels as far as I am informed.

  body: "This won't help with your problem, but just a general observation here about
    Brother, and in general to beware/be careful with their Mac print drivers. I'm
    on the Mac and have had a Brother printer or two, and as far as I can discern,
    they seem to be one of those companies who deal with the Windows market first
    and foremost, with their Mac drivers tacked on as an afterthought to pick up some
    extra change. Their stuff can be terribly buggy.\r\n\r\nI currently have a Brother
    P-touch labelmaker which can be used either manually (typing directly on its keyboard)
    or driven directly from the computer. Even having had it for a couple of years
    now, through two versions of the Mac OS, and with a few different revs to the
    labelmaker's print driver by Brother, they cannot seem to get the Mac OSX drivers
    sufficiently debugged. Only recourse for me is to use the OS9/Classic drivers
    for the labelmaker and print via the Classic application for it they also supply.
    Which is quite crude-looking in that it displays fonts as jagged bitmaps, but
    at least the line endings are displayed correctly, and it prints fine.\r\n\r\nThe
    first couple of OSX drivers for the Brother unit worked, barely, with seriously
    crippled functionality. Recently, after trying to install the latest one they
    came out with--the third one I have tried--and trying to install it two different
    times with the same results), I had to give up and go back to the Classic version
    yet again. It had somehow hosed something in my system so badly (couldn't load
    fonts, couldn't print from any app, many apps would quit on launch) that after
    an hour or so of unsuccessfuI troubleshooting, I decided to stop wasting my time
    and simply restore the entire hard drive from a cloned backup (I back up every
    night) to get my system functioning properly again.\r\n"
