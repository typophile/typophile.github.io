body: I've been working on a logo for Large development group called Innovation Park
  and they have already chosen a simple type treatment with Neutra Light for the name
  Innovation Park. But now this is going to be the subhead to everything that's actually
  going to be built at the site. (new info to me) Luxury Hotels @ Innovation Park..
  Corporate Offices @ Innovatin Park.. What's a good font that can work we'll with
  Neutra Display Light but steal the show.. Please help!  here's a sample of what
  im working with.. please ignore kerning since this is still in early stages of development.

  body: "Why not another weight of Neutraface? It would be difficult to match another
    Art Deco geometric face so you could look at a script, for example\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/coquette/\r\n\r\nWhy
    steal the show?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me your current concepts, especially the upper
    and lower case version, will need to be kept above a certain size for the mark
    to remain printable, I would be tempted to use colour or alignment to make the
    logo.\r\n\r\nTim"

    the same face and didn''t have enough distinction. I''ll play around with some
    nice scripts. Thanks for the suggestion! '

  body: "I think you have to pick a script or other style of typeface with far more
    sympathy to Neutraface, you should also consider when positioning the heads that
    it should work with any copy. Obviously I don't know the full case but with the
    colourways and scale you seem to be dwarfing the parent logo, I would have thought
    the new copy is actually subservient to the logo or at least shouldn't have the
    emphasis you have placed on them.\r\nTim"

    hard time finding something that works well. \r\n\r\nnot sure how the text is
    subservient with the emphasis you've placed on it? \r\n\r\nI want Retail shops
    At - to be the main logo. I'll play around with scale of the two parts and see
    what I can come up with. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Well I thought Coquette was sympathetic\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/artemisia-nf/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/monte-carlo-script-nf/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/londonderry-air-nf/\r\n\r\nMy
    instinct is still that Neutraface is the way to go, the top left sample with the
    bold all caps version of the logo seems an obvious but attractive approach. Alternatively
    if the Innovation Park logo is already familiar to the viewer perhaps you could
    use the o device alone, e.g. CORPORATE OFFICES at O.\r\nTim"

  body: I would have to agree that coquette looks very nice with Neutraface, (thanks
    for the visual example) I'll go purchase it and play around with some options.
    Thanks alot everybody!  timid, thanks for some other options as well.

  body: I would use the bold caps version of your Innovation park logo with something
    classy over the top of it.. Like Trajan for example. Maybe a little smaller and
    tracked out quite a bit..And maybe something drk gray instead of black..

  body: "Tiffany, that banner for Coquette that appeared on Typographica is what made
    me buy Coquette a few years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do agree that all Neutraface
    is probably the way to go. I just can't see the suits approving \"Corporate Office\"
    set in Coquette--it's too girly.\r\n\r\nI do think that Innovation Park shouldn't
    be in U&lc. It creates awkward spaces when stacked underneath another line of
    type and a horizontal rule. I would go with the top text in U&lc and Innovation
    Park set in all caps or perhaps small caps.\r\n\r\nDon't rule out using the Condensed
    weights of Neutraface, if you purchased them.\r\n\r\nOne last thing, I remember
    working on a project using Neutraface and asking about a companion serif. Somehow
    word got around and I received an email from Christian Schwartz (who designed
    Neutraface for those napping during class) and he recommended Sabon (but not Sabon
    Next)or Whitman. I ended up choosing Whitman, but admittedly, it was for text
    use with Neutraface serving as the display, not a logo project."
