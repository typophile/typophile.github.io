  body: "If that's the logo, the font looks like <a href=\"http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFArrow_2c5a.html\">Arrow</a>,
    in the book or light weight. Possibly the middle serif on the E has been removed.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "First of all, thanks Florian for the image.\r\nIt is the one.\r\nAnd thanks,
    Mike!\r\nSeems to be a worthwhile trace, yet, on the link you gave I found only
    the ultrabold version.\r\nTried to search for it on fontshop without success and
    stopped after a while in Google for thousands of symbol types came out for the
    arrow. I am too stupid for good searching.\r\nIn any case I think something was
    done with a standard font, yet, changed a bit.\r\n\r\nThanks so far\r\nStefan"
