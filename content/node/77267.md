  a particular typeface built into one .otf file. In the same manner that stylistic
  sets are used to have alternative characters for certain glyphs could this be used
  to house an entire family?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSM"

  body: "Technically it is possible to include weights and italics inside the regular
    font as stylistic sets. But if the software that uses the font doesn\u2019t recognize
    OT features, you\u2019ll have a normal typeface with no access to anything else.
    \r\n\r\nIf you use the font in a software that does recognize OT features, then
    your weights and italics could be lost if at some point you decide to switch to
    any other font."

  body: "My reasoning was that one single font file would be more efficient than 6+.
    My fonts folder on my machine is a labyrinth of files and folder and I wondered
    if anybody had done this.\r\n\r\nI was also curious to see if anybody had done
    anything slightly unorthodox using opentype features. \r\n\r\nThanks for the response."

    be a better solution for that.

  body: "There can be use for such a thing. An educational publisher in the Netherlands
    has a special writing system. In the example you can see different kind of 'i-j'
    ligatures, The so called IJ of ij in Dutch. Depending on the position, ij.begin,
    ij.alt1-3 or ij.end is used. In this way al characters can be connected.\r\nIn
    this writing method, there is also an example showing how a character should be
    written. These characters (and the 2 thin ones) could have been placed into another
    font, but that font wouldn't have the joining character. That might cause some
    confusion.\r\nWith this font the designer doesn't have to switch between typefaces.
    If they want to show a single character, the normal version is selected (ij).
    By choosing the appropriate stylistic set, they can have the version with the
    arrows (ij.arr) or the thin version (ij,thin or ij.thin.arr). The font also contains
    special symbols in other stylistic sets. \r\nThe feedback from the people using
    the font was that this system worked much easier and with hardly any mistakes,
    when compared to all the different fonts they used in the past.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zwij_6574.jpg]"

  body: "<em>Just for the record:</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe ij-variants shown here are
    part of <em>Pennenstreken</em>, a writing method for primary schools. More than
    fifteen years ago &ndash;when we still did work for third parties&ndash; this
    system was digitized at the Dutch Type Library for the publisher Zwijsen. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pennenstreken_1_small_6506.jpg]\r\nUntil
    that time the instruction books, cards and games for <em>Pennenstreken</em> were
    handwritten and during digitizing I found out that there were many inconsistencies
    in the method that were circumvented by the calligrapher, who did this work for
    a long time then (I am not sure if she was pleased with the stuff going digital).
    So, I had to define a range of medial variants to make any combination of letters
    possible. The number of variants furthermore increased by the isolated, initial
    and final versions and the thinner versions for larger point sizes and the ones
    that contained info about the writing direction, instruction/practicing shapes,
    and so on.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pennenstreken_4_small_5406.jpg]\r\nThe
    letters that formed the basis in the initial instruction books were enlarged and
    we manually digitized these in the IKARUS format. Further enhancements and refinements
    were applied in the Bezier format. As one can imagine, we ended up with an enormous
    amount of glyphs, which had to be placed in single byte PS Type1 fonts. I made
    a system for this and used for instance style linking for switching between the
    different variants. Of course, this resulted in a comprehensive manual that I
    wrote for the people working in Quark XPress on the instruction books and other
    stuff. The whole project asked for a perfect administration and organization,
    but it was complex still for the designers to apply the correct glyph variants.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pennenstreken_2_small_6731.jpg]\r\nWhen
    the Dutch Type Library stopped working for third parties at the end of the 1990\u2019s
    (from that time on we only focus on the DTL typefaces and software), I transferred
    the copyright on the digital <em>Pennestreken</em> types to the publisher. As
    far as I know the first OpenType fonts were developed at a later stage internally
    at Zwijsen using FontLab Studio.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pennenstreken_3_small_6737.jpg]\r\nLet
    me underline here that I was not responsible in any way for the method itself.
    I tried to discuss the ideas and principles behind the system, but these methods
    are developed in an obviously closed environment of all kinds of educational experts.
    Anyway, as I wrote, this project was done a long time ago.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB\r\n"
