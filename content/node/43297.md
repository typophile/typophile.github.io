  body: A classmate of mine is working on his final project, and he's been using this
    typeface via cut and paste from an old newspaper. He'd like to find the typeface
    to speed up his work. I looked around a bit, checked out the solotype fonts on
    myfonts, but I found nothing. I have a feeling that this used to be a fairly common
    typeface, at some point.

    will try to find it. Ah... cut and paste, remember it well. You kids have it so
    easy.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontfinder.ws/22892/Ravenscroft.html\r\n"
