body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nI just finished my very first font and I'd love to hear you
  thoughts.\r\nIt's called Cliquot; It's a \"fat\" slab serif meant for magazine text
  in Spanish and is inspired by Caecilia and Chaparral. It was the final project in
  my Type Design Class and I'm quite proud of it.\r\n\r\nHere's the complete character
  set:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Especimen-02_6317.png]\r\nAnd attached
  is a PDF specimen featuring a fragment of Julio Cortazar's \"Rayuela\"\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nRo."

  body: "I think the basis is very nice and I particularly like your numbers. It has
    great potential but I can't help but feel there are still a lot of weight consistency
    issues.\r\n\r\nI had a look at your specimen and in the main body text I actually
    don't notice these weight issues anymore, so I suppose this only counts when used
    as a display typeface.\r\n\r\n- My main issue is that most rounded forms in the
    capitals seem to be a bit too fat. 'C' and 'G' for example look too heavy on the
    left while 'D' looks too heavy on the right. The rounded forms in 'B' however
    are too light and I think 'B' could be a little bit wider (though I like its elegant
    design so I definitely wouldn't make it as wide as is common in a typeface like
    this).\r\n\r\n- The letters h/n/m/u are a bit too wide and this is obvious even
    in the body text.\r\n\r\n- Why are the downward serifs in letters like C/E/F/G
    etc. more robust than the horizontal serifs? I would make them slightly lighter.\r\n\r\n-
    The \"tail\" of the 'Q' is a bit too heavy and so is the spine of 'S'. The stem
    of 'T' seems a bit too light.\r\n\r\n- The lowercase 'x' also seems a bit more
    heavy than the 'y' for example.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
