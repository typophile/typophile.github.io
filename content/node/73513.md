  body: a bit difficult to see from my screen, it's quite big and i can't get the
    whole picture. the color of the background sets off a vintage vibe and is nice
    if that is your aim.

    see the entire thing at a smaller size.\r\n\r\n\"have fun and\" needs to be bigger.\r\nis
    this a \"gay spirit\" poster? or what do those rainbows mean?"

  body: "I also get the gay theme to the poster with the rainbow, if it is so then
    keep it.\r\n\r\nI would agree that if you are keeping the rainbows then either
    full width (might come off worse) or think about having them smaller and centered
    under the first two words.\r\n\r\nOne last thing that could just be me, the counterless
    type on the bottom gives me the impression of something else that might clash
    if you are working a gay theme, also more space around your work and at the begining
    and end of your counterless words if you are to keep them.\r\n\r\nGreat vintage
    feel to it as already stated.\r\n\r\nMat."
