  have sent multiple messages asking simple account-related questions in the past
  few months and never heard anything back. Also made a donation some time ago and
  too never heard anything back, except for a PayPal receipt. Tried contacting through
  the form on the typophile shop site, nada. \r\n\r\nIs there no one on the other
  end or am I missing something obvious ?"

    to a wall kind of situation that puzzles me. \r\n\r\nIt's one thing to not know
    the answer to the question and just plainly say so, and the other not to bother
    answering at all. And all I was asking if it were possible to change a username
    for the account, and how to go about using the donation badge image."

  body: In other threads, I've seen moderators let on that they can change usernames,
    so contacting one of [[http://typophile.com/moderators|them]] might get quicker
    results for that issue.

    derive a lot of benefit from this place; but hopefully\r\nventing isn't one of

    which supposedly meant I was going to receive a T-shirt. Never got that shirt.
    And never an answer to my questions regarding that either.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert
