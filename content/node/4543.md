body: Hi <BR> <BR>Being a total noob, please bare with me :-&#41; <BR>I have a problem
  with the font called Akbar. Its &#34;height&#34; is too high when used on a Microsoft
  SmartPhone. I&#39;m using High-Logic Font Creator Program and am looking for the
  Typographic term for the font &#34;height&#34; or how it is defined in a TTF. <BR>
  <BR>What can I do? <BR> <BR>Help, please <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'Default linespacing of TT fonts in MS apps is based on a combination of two
    values in the OS/2 table: <BR>   WinAscent <BR>   WinDescent <BR> <BR>Simplistically,
    if you reduce these values, the linespacing will be tighter. <BR> <BR>Ideally,
    there is also a relationship between these two values and the combination of the
    other vertical metrics values in the OS/2 table <BR> <BR>   typoAscender <BR>   typoDescender
    <BR>   typoLineGap <BR> <BR>which should, expressed as positive integers, equal
    the sum of the WinAscent and WinDescent values. However, for your purposes you
    can probably get away with just adjusting the WinAscent and WinDescent. Rather
    than adjusting them by equal amounts, you should take a look at the relationship
    of the actual ascender and descender heights of the <i>d</i> and <i>p</i> glyphs
    to these values, and determine which of the values needs most adjustment. <BR>
    <BR>This thread probably belongs in the &#39;Build&#39; category.'

  body: Wow thanks a lot! <BR>I will give it a go. I actually also had suspected it
    had something to do with those values, but there were so incredibly many different
    ones that I didn&#39;t know heads from tales. <BR> <BR>And yes, I guess this belongs
    in &#39;Build&#39;. Sorry for that, as said I&#39;m a newcomer. :-&#41;
