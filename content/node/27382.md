  out there.\r\n\r\nI doodled 6 geometric patterns almost by accident. They can't
  be original and are probably all in a dingbat, crochet pattern book or cave painting
  somewhere. But anyway, because there are 6 of them and because they look a bit oriental
  i thought about associating 1 of the 6 elements in chinese philosophy to each of
  them, which are (in no particular order)...\r\n\r\n<strong> earth  -  air  -  fire
  \ -  water  -  metal  -  wood </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter spending way too long pondering
  it I've still not totally made my mind up. Patterns within patterns, associations
  and abstractions etc...\r\n\r\nI'm curious to see if there will be any kind of consensus
  of opinion, or if you will all tell me to sod off and join an occult or theology
  forum.\r\n\r\nIf you are gonna bother posting your matches just don't look at other
  peoples answers first if you can help it.\r\n\r\nBTW each pattern is numbered, just
  in case you hadn't noticed.\r\n\r\nI find them very appealing for some reason and
  thought about making them available as 6 small canvases (6\"x6\" obviously) maybe
  screen printed. (hence the photoshop mockup) Anyones thoughts on the matter are
  most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GeometricElements_5255.jpg]"

    to Right: \r\n\r\n1. Earth: Reminds me of a cross which reminds me of religion
    which reminds me of home which reminds me of my mom which reminds me of mother
    earth.\r\n2. Wood: rings of a tree\r\n3. Air, the cross flows freely through the
    window\r\n4. Metal: i see facets of a diamond\r\n5. Fire: the way it flows outward\r\n6.
    Water: ripples in the water.\r\n"

  body: "Geometric Elements - The Result\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you Tom, James, Tiffany
    and Simon for posting your choices.\r\n\r\nAfter you guys posted i persuaded 5
    of my friends to give their opinions, plus me makes 10.\r\n\r\nI had hoped for
    a greater response, so the larger the sample group the clearer the consensus would
    be. Anyway, the results were...\r\n\r\n1: earth 3 / air 1 / fire 1 / water 0 /
    metal 5 / wood 0 (majority = metal)\r\n2: earth 5 / air 0 / fire 1 / water 1 /
    metal 0 / wood 3 (majority = earth)\r\n3: earth 1 / air 2 / fire 2 / water 1 /
    metal 1 / wood 3 (majority = wood)\r\n4: earth 1 / air 3 / fire 3 / water 0 /
    metal 1 / wood 2 (majority = air/fire)\r\n5: earth 0 / air 4 / fire 3 / water
    2 / metal 0 / wood 1 (majority = air)\r\n6: earth 0 / air 0 / fire 0 / water 6
    / metal 3 / wood 1 (majority = water)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to see, even
    with such a small sample group, how opinions still frequently corresponded on
    something (apparently) so abstract.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my choice...\r\n\r\n1:
    metal\r\n2: earth\r\n3: fire\r\n4: wood\r\n5: air\r\n6: water\r\n\r\n...which
    i don't think i'm being too fascistic in sticking with, as it only breaks from
    the democratic consensus by switching 2 of the elements which were fairly closely
    drawn anyway :)\r\n\r\nAnd thank you James for the link to the \"Magician's Companion\".
    I don't think i can resist getting a copy now. I would like to know what symbol
    and element associations the master, Bill Whitcomb, would make.\r\n\r\nLook out
    for the symbols on a t-shirt in your neighbourhood sometime soon ;)\r\n"

  body: "Glad you made it back to the thread. Bill is crazy in a very very good way,
    as you will notice from his book, which is largely a compendium of archaic glyph
    systems. \r\n\r\nGood to see your take. I was highly influenced by the construction
    of the I Ching symbols and their portrayal of permeability and motion. "
