  body: My guess is handlettered. The repeating characters (i, r) don't match up.

  body: You just presented three more letters that don't match up to the already unmatching
    letters in the first image, Griffin - further supporting the theory that this
    was done by hand.

    What's the magazine?

    Giorgio and the o in Dior appear to be the same.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Ahh... attention to detail Patty - I wasn't wearing my glasses. \r\n\r\nI
    still think it's an OT font though. All the characters are individual (apart from
    the rm in Armani). If one was writing like that there'd surely be some joining
    characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
