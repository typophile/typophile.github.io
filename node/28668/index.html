  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have been adding [[Greek]] letters to a text typeface I am developing called Gorani. Now, I was highly impressed with the Greek in Adobe Garamond Premier Pro, and decided to emulate the steep implied pen angle in its Greek lowercase. As you can see in this sample, the ductus in Adobe Garamond Premier Pro is such that the horizontal lines are thicker than the verticals.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamond-Premier-Pro-Greek_6673.gif]

None of the other non-monolinear Greek typefaces I have seen has this feature, as far as I recall, so I figured I would do something original. Here is my attempt so far for the Greek in Gorani (no bold or italic yet, obviously):

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gorani-Serif-Greek_6208.gif]

Now, after I drew the Greek lowercase letters for Gorani, I took another look at the AGPP samples online and noticed that I didn't use the same pen angle after all. In case it's hard to see in the samples, this is what I mean:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGPP-Gorani-Comparison_4096.gif]

My question is this: is the angle I have right now for Gorani a wrong angle for use in a serious text face? Before, when I thought I was using AGPP's pen angle, I thought it at least had a reputable precedent, but now I am asking myself whether I should redraw the whole alphabet. My intention for Gorani is for it to be a readable, no-frills serif face for setting long continuous text at 8-10pt; I am not a native reader of Greek, so I don't have a precise idea of what is permissible in this case.

And since I am asking, just how unusual is AGPP to modern Greek readers--not at all, a little, or a lot? Are there other examples of unusual pen angles in Greek typefaces? Also, are there sample images of the sort of calligraphy that Garamond's Greek is based on? The typeface exudes calligraphic heritage, but I'm just not familiar with any calligraphy that would have inspired it. Most Greek manuscripts I remember seem to use pretty monolinear letters.</div>

Have a look at the greek fonts designed by students in Reading university as well.

I wouldn't say that AGPP strikes me as unusual. I could say "oldfashioned". And that might made it hard to use in several contexts.

		<div class="commentbody">George, thanks for the links. I actually knew about the Greek Font Society's typefaces, and though I was unclear, I was including the multiple pen angles of GFS Didot as part of the repertoire that I considered usual in Greek typefaces.

Thank you especially for pointing me to the output from Reading University--it is a veritable goldmine. I knew about Maiola and Gentium, but I am certainly impressed with the gems I am seeing for the first time. I'm still looking through all the presentations, but Patrick Giasson's <a href="http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~lts98gl/MATD/PGiasson_Median.pdf">Median</a> does the kind of thing I was going for--a low-contrast Greek with large "kappa height" and the sort of ductus used in Garamond Premier Pro (Thanks, Thomas). It even has a shorter descender for the eta, a design feature originally part of my design that I discarded for fear of being too unconventional. I just might bring that back.

I wish they had a larger sample of Omonia CF; it looks solid, but it's hard to judge at the size they have it at. I also wish I had saved some samples of Greek in print from the time my family lived in Athens. I didn't know back then I would become so interested in designing typefaces.

So can anyone answer my original question about how appropriate the stress angle I used in the Gorani sample above would be for a text typeface? Are there any actual precedents for it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Wolfgang. I'll try to check out those books, but this is where I bemoan the fact that I am no longer able to access the huge university library system from my student days. I am actually in the middle of my military service and not due out until 2008 (so I'll miss the conference, too). It's a mixed blessing, as I have loads of free time to try my hand on typeface design, but I have to really get out of my way to find the kind of print resources that would help. That's why I love the Typophile forums so much.</div>

A serious text face does not center around pen angles.
