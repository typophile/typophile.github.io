  in a font, i.e. pointing hands. As someone whose skills and work do not usually
  involve figurative illustration, I found this quite a challenge, although I'm now
  quite happy with the slightly gaunt and ascetic result (now I look at it, I realise
  that somewhere in the back of my mind was an Eric Gill wood engraving of a pair
  of hands joined in prayer).\r\n\r\nThe exercise started me pondering a few questions:\r\n\r\nWhat
  is the earliest exemplar of the typographic fist/index in use?\r\n\r\nWhat are some
  designs by my contemporary colleagues that include this character?\r\n\r\nAnd what
  are some favourite fists/indexes?\r\n\r\nHere is my effort, for the new custom types
  for the academic publisher Brill:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brillfist_6643.png]"

    to the world's pointing hands with this pointing hand graphic (there's a fill
    version too) I did for an Indigo Book store last Xmas...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handpointing_6625.jpg]\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe
    pointing hands were mounted on a steel pillars at about four feet up from the
    ground and the blue 'stars' were mounted ten feet up from it on the same pillars. "

  body: "There are some examples of drawn fists (including one on a Gutenberg page)
    [[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/invention/marginalia/|here]].
    \r\n\r\nLooks like the information from William Sherman's [[http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_002.html|posting]]
    linked in one of those earlier Typophile threads appears in Sherman's [[http://books.google.com/books?id=B9dGU0iYaAAC|book]],
    too. \r\n\r\nMany of the Dadaists loved manicules. One of my favorite uses appears
    in Tristan Tzara's [[http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm|\"manifesto
    on feeble love and bitter love\"]] from 1920. Marcel Duchamp put one in his last
    major painting, [[http://artgallery.yale.edu/pages/collection/popups/pc_modern/details19.html|Tu
    M']] (or rather hired a commercial artist to add it).  \r\n\r\nJohn, I agree that
    that hotdog of a finger could be scaled back a bit."

  body: My way past retirement age print teacher (who was a printer, not a typographer)
    insisted that the fists were called 'bangers'. But whenever I use that word, designers
    say I'm wrong. Anyone else ever hear them called that?

  body: Traditionally, typesetters/printers called exclamation points "bangs" (for
    obvious reasons), which is where "interrobang" comes from (interrogative + exclamatory).
