  body: "It is a problem that the font is expensive for you, due to exchange rates/economic
    climate etc., but this is really the wrong place to ask \"Where can i down load
    it from the net for nothing\", as most people (I assume) on this forum are against
    the illegal distribution of 'pay' fonts.  As Formlos says, your best option is
    to go for a legitimately free font that comes close.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nJH"
