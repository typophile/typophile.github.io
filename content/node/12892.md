body: I'm looking to recreate the look of an old late 1800's/early 1900's circus poster.
  Could anyone recommend some good freeware circus/playbill fonts that would be appropriate,
  or maybe even some cheap commercial fonts?

    are being part of SoftMaker's complete 15,000+-fonts typeface library, and are
    both western slab-serifed typefaces.   Both of which are appearing on "MegaFont
    XXL 3.0" and "infiniType 4" (two premium-quality typeface collections from SoftMaker,
    which were being released on May 27, 2014).

      flare (lots of swashes, etc.). And this project is something I'm doing as a
      favor for someone, so I'm really looking for some freeware fonts. But I've looked
      through DaFont and a few other places, so I might've about exhausted all there
      is.

      section at DaFont and found a lot of fonts I had overlooked. Guess I consider
      Retro to be 50's and 60's-ish fonts and din't think to check there for what
      I was looking for.\r\n\r\nThe project I'm working on is actually a t-shirt design
      for my church's Vacation Bible School this summer. The theme for this year is
      \"Under God's Big Top,\" so I'm trying to mimic the look of an old circus poster
      for the t-shirt design. It's still a work in progress, but here's what I've
      come up with so far; feel free to offer any advice or suggestions:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flatface.net/~johnmiles/vbsdesignpreview.jpg"

        Thanks for the suggestion btw, bec11679, but I guess I'm really going for
        more of a clean look rather than that dirty style, which might not come out
        as well on a shirt."

    Of course, it all depends on what style you are going for--this font is distressed.
