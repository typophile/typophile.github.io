    have\u2014Leitura is awesome, and I've been admiring it for a while. I had no
    idea that the weights were that cheap; I was thinking it would cost more than
    only ~$29 per weight. And I'm quite fond of STF's work\u2014my copy of iWork came
    with some versions of Stone Sans, and I've seen Stone Sans/Serif around, and I've
    always liked them. :3 \r\n\r\nI'm amazed that Sabon *Pro* is only $135 for the
    whole lot, too; I thought it'd cost more. I've used Sabon Std when I interned
    at a place with an Adobe Font Folio licence, but it wasn't Pro! I may go with
    Leitura, from what I see, but I'm not 100% sure yet. Thanks everyone for the suggestions!"

    also see what you mean about usability, though, although I'm not a big fan of
    Galliard (sorry; I respect the work put into it, but it's not a personal favourite)

  body: "@jmontalbano Thanks for pointing that out. I thought that $140 was an incredible
    deal for 8 fonts, and far less than what I've seen large families going for. (I've
    seen, say, four-font families going for that price, but eight?) Whitman is really
    nice, but I don't know if I'm currently up to paying $70/style at the moment--it's
    just a bit too expensive for me at the moment, but maybe in future! That's really
    misleading of FontShop to claim that they're full-featured OpenType fonts when
    they're not, and OpenType is kind of important to me. Not that I need, say, expert
    figures or more fractions than normal (right now, anyway), but I do like using
    old-style figures in running text, as well as small caps for headings. \r\n\r\nRe
    the fonts people have linked here--Freight Text is really nice! A *little* bit
    more expensive than what I'm looking for (that goes for FontShop's stuff in general,
    TBH), but really lovely, at the same time. I've always liked the colouring of
    Freight when I've seen it. Milo's really too expensive for me--lovely, but a bit
    too steep on my budget. Again, maybe in future! :3 I really like Rongel, as well.
    It's probably around $50 more than what I'd like to spend, but I still rather
    like it. \r\n\r\nRight now, the best deals look like the stuff Adobe have (although
    my favourites already came with the Adobe software), Sumner Stone's text fonts
    (probably the best deals of the lot, although I'm not certain whether he includes
    OT features in his families that aren't being distributed by Adobe/ITC) and some
    of DSType's text fonts. People made good points about Leitura's style (not the
    best idea for papers), although I really liked Mafra! I definitely don't need
    massive superfamilies, either--regular, bold, italic and bold-italic tend to work
    fine. I really like what everyone's suggested, though, and am going to give it
    some thought for when I finally decide what to get. :) Style-wise, I prefer old-styles/garaldes,
    although I can also see the merit in picking transitionals.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    none of my current teachers really care if I don't use Times, but I know there
    are some teachers out there who claim that Times is 'MLA style'...when the MLA
    handbook actually doesn't specify a particular typeface. :P  "

  body: "<cite> > I'm not sure if this was Lew's decision or FontShop's, but I'm sure
    most users would prefer to have fewer, more feature-rich fonts.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    conversation has moved on, but I thought I\u2019d clarify just for the record.\r\n\r\nYes,
    Whitman is not the best choice for those on a tight budget. I agree, the way FontShop
    presents the package is potentially misleading.\r\n\r\nNote: it\u2019s not so
    much that the fonts were \u201Cbroken out,\u201D as that they\u2019ve never been
    combined together.\r\n\r\nThe \u201C8 fonts for $140\u201D is a byproduct of these
    fonts being almost ten years old. At the time they were released, getting a choice
    of either OsF or LF as default with the U&lc and getting both versions of the
    fonts for a single license fee was a big deal. Now, not so much.\r\n\r\nThe OpenType
    fonts of Whitman are pretty much just straight conversions of the PostScript fonts.
    In that respect, they\u2019re akin to the Adobe Std paradigm.\r\n\r\nJust because
    a font is OT format doesn\u2019t mean it will have every bell and whistle. I don\u2019t
    think that either FontShop or Font Bureau claims that these fonts are \u201Cfull-featured.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
    will mention, however, that an undocumented aspect of the current Whitman OT fonts
    is the fact that each variation has both figure sets, both accessible via OT features,
    but just different defaults. So, if you generally want OsF in text, you can select
    the OsF font; but then if you need an instance of LF, you can just apply the OT
    feature, instead of changing to the LF font. And vice versa.\r\n\r\nBut no, small
    caps have not been integrated yet. And so are counted as separately priced fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not excusing the fact that the fonts are out of date. Just explaining."

    choosing Galliard as a workhorse -- while I am quite fond of text set in Galliard
    Roman, I find that the italic can be quite distracting when used in body text.
    I do in fact <em> like </em> the italic, I just feel that it draws too much attention

    I DID notice that *small caps* are being sold separately, which is making me reconsider
    getting Farnham as opposed to something that has a larger set of OpenType variants
    for a similar price. Lyon Text is looking better to me right now. \r\n\r\n@Trevor
    Baum - Corda is really nice! I think it looks a bit more appropriate for display,
    though, than what I'd be using it for. \r\n\r\n@ everyone - as I said to Kent
    Lew above, I'm considering Lyon Text as my final choice. It's only $10 more than
    what Farnham would cost if I get the regular, italic, bold and bold-italic weights
    (or variants thereof; I know I want to just start off with four weights), and
    it includes small caps, old-style figures and tabular figures inside the same
    files, which is a much better deal for me than getting them separately. (Not that
    the other choices aren't worth it; they're fantastic--this just looks like the
    best option for me at the moment.) What I really like about Lyon is its colouring,
    at least onscreen. "
