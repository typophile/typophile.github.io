  and this forum is quickly becoming my favorite \"go-to\" sites of the day.\r\n\r\nJust
  curious if anyone has any good go-to books for a designer to learn more \"theory\"
  on branding design.\r\n\r\nEvery once in awhile someone will want a new logo and
  I'd like to have more education on how to approach the project. \r\n\r\nThanks for
  your suggestions.\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: "Have a look at \r\n'Marks of Excellence'  by  Per Mollerup\r\nIt's a good
    collection of what's out there.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of books by corporate design
    (as it used to be called before it got rid of any social responsibility and re-emerged
    as 'branding') and branding gurus and companies like Wally Olins and Chermayeff
    & Geismar (and so many more) about what they are doing, but this is rather self-propmotion.\r\n\r\nI
    think Paul Rand's books are still quite important for corporate design. \r\nHow
    he built up his presentation for the IBM logo is still impressive."
