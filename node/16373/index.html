<div class=commentbody>If those letters are part of the building, it is almost certainly not a font but a product of the sign-making trade as it existed then. It was a parallel but separate industry to type founding, just as handlettering was. There was certainly some cross-polinization going on, but it was not like nowadays when you can go down to FastSigns and have them make a sign with any old font.</div>

It is hard for today's younger designers to realize what a different world it was back then. Most things were done by hand. As Mark says, there was a "Sign Making" trade which was not the same as the "Hand Lettering Artist" or the "Typesetting trade". It was quicker and cheaper to get someone from the proper trade to just do it by hand from scratch than to try and port one set of letters from craft A to either B or C.
Our world of the quick scan-font ID-online purchase-Postscript output-CadCam is quite incredible when compared to how things were done pre tech. People actually wrote hand written letters to eachother then too.

<div class=commentbody><em>It is hard for today’s younger designers to realize what a different world it was back then. </em>
Back in the seventies, I used to frequently see hand-painted signs where they were trying to match Helvetica. I guess the handwriting was on the wall, so to speak.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There are plenty of other sources related to all kinds of trades that use letterforms. I do from time to time visit these sites just to keep on top of current technology and aesthetics.
As a jump point for the sign industry, I frequently start at <a href=http://www.sign101.com/ target=new>SignIndustry.com</a>.
There are also sites dedicated to the bronze and stonecut monument trade, vinyl sign cutting, restoration signage, and architectural-environmental signage.
A funny thing though... I feel a typographer is qualified to design architectural signage, but I wouldn't trust an architect to design a book. :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for thinking I'm a "young" designer...I guess. Unless by "young" you mean "ignorant."
I figured it was probably a one-off, but I was hoping that someone who perhaps had some familiarity with historical sign-making or engraving might be able to tell me "Oh, yeah, it's based on this or that."
While we're on the subject, was there a suite of off-the-rack letterforms that signmakers/engravers would use as templates or stencils back then? Did foundries make any such thing?
For example, if I walked into a monument shop would the salesperson have me look through a sample book of some kind, and was there a national supplier of sample books?

<div class=commentbody>Most signs done today use compurter scanners, plotters, engravers, etc. and many of these systems use PC front ends allowing the user to load at least TrueType fonts. Other system are proprietary but do offer font kits.
One of the largest manufacturers of sign making equipment is Gerber Scientific. You can see their <a href=http://www.gspinc.com/products/fonts/index.html target=new>font offering here</a>.
During the mid-to-late eighties, I worked with Agfa in private labelling two of the Gerber Scientific vinyl plotters, which means I did type specimen books for specific sign making equipment and sample signs for boats, vans, storefronts, etc.</div>

Not foundries, but there were books and manuals on how to make the letters. There were general principles, but each author tended to have his own style. There were often references to popular type styles, maybe showing how to do lettering that resembled "Caslon" or "Futura" or whatever. There were also trade schools and apprenticeships, so the knowledge and techniques were passed on from generation to generation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sign people made their own sample book by hand to show their styles. "Book" may be too strong of a term. They were just as likely to hang samples around their shop so customers could browse. To quote the PGA ads--"Some of those guys were good!"
