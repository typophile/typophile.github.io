  body: NICK JOIE's is a heavier weight of <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=copperplate&PREFS_SET%5Bipp%5D=96'
    target='_blank'>Copperplate</a>. There are several to choose from. My choice would
    be <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/copperplate-gothic/' target='_blank'>Copperplate
    Gothic Std 33 BC</a>. Shadows added manually.

  body: Concur with Mike on Copperplate. The ampersand is something different though

  body: Perhaps someone will find the ampersand in a font, but I have to wonder if
    it's not a custom creation - both because of its appearance and the way it synchs
    up so nicely with the J.
