body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m am stuck in the following peculiar situation:\r\n\r\nI
  have a MM typeface, composed from two masters (weight \u2013 wt0 and wt1). After
  careful kerning  (started four times from scratch) I ended with 6000 kern pairs,
  which include Latin, Cyrillic, small caps for both, different numeral sets, fractions
  and etc. \u2013 it\u2019s a big typeface. When building the kern feature and then
  compiling the font everything works just fine. But, if I split the typeface to the
  desired instances, for fine tuning and polishing, it seems that after updating the
  kern feature, every font does not compile (excluding the equivalent of wt0) - ending
  with \u201C[FATAL] GPOS feature 'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable\u201D.
  The peculiar thing is that, if I split the typeface only to the two masters wt0
  and wt1, wt0 compiles ok with 6000 pairs. On the other hand wt1 does return \u201CGPOS
  overflow..\u201D every time, until I reduce the pairs to approximately 4420, which
  is -1600 pairs short. \r\n\r\nAny ideas what could cause this kind of behavior?
  \ Thank you in advance!\r\n\r\nnote: I am using Fontlab 5.04 win. My class kerning
  is revolving around the idea to have class for every glyph (not shape type) that
  is part of composite + Cyrillic : A\u2019 Atilte Adireseis\u2026..cyrillic A\u2026etc.
  \ Classes are composed from mixed script characters, so I could only kern for differences.\r\n"

  body: I've gotten this message, trying to generate fonts with far fewer kerning
    pairs. Maybe FontLab ought to pay more attention to fixing structural flaws, rather
    than adding a lot of new and unasked-for functions and features, which will probably
    involve a steep learning curve. IMHO.

  body: "You shouldn\u2019n mix different scripts in one kerning class, it may cause
    an increasing of unnecessary kerning pairs when changing class kerning into plain
    kerning (because some applications don\u2019t support class kerning). Also I remember
    Miguel Saosa wrote that when you have a large character set (more than 2000 glyphs)
    and different scripts you have to optimise kern feature, for example your classes
    for different scripts shouldn\u2019t mix in the class panel: first all latin classes
    should go and after them all cyrillic ones or first cyrillic and then latin, but
    don\u2019t mix them. I think this may be the reason for your kern feature overflow.
    I had kern feature overflow too, and after rearranging of classes my feature compiled.
    Also check if there any glyphs that belong to more then one class with one side.
    Hope it helps. "

  body: "This error generally occurs because the contents of the kern feature lookups
    overflow the size limit of the GPOS subtable. The way to fix it is to break up
    the kern feature into a number of smaller subtables. This can be done manually
    in the feature code, but for best results I recommend licensing Karsten Luecke's
    excellent <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm\">KLTF Make Kern
    Feature</a> script, which analyses your kerning data and generates the most efficient
    kern feature code with appropriate subtable breaks.\r\n\r\nSee also http://www.kltf.de/downloads/KLTF-MakeKernFeature.pdf"

    not sure what you mean. It circumvents the kern subtable overflow limit, which
    is what it is designed to do. I've used it -- via the VOLT export option -- on
    some very large fonts with the class+exception equivalent of >100,000 flat kern
    pairs."

    we had so many extremely large fonts to work with?</em>\r\n\r\nIt's not particular
    to the kern feature subtable, it just happens that this feature is the most common
    to exceed the subtable limit. The limit is part of the basic architecture of TrueType,
    in which there is a 64k size restriction on table size. The extension mechanism
    in the OpenType Layout tables enables this to be overcome, but each subtable within
    the mechanism is still limited to 64k.\r\n\r\nRecently, I hit the GPOS subtable
    limit with a mark positioning feature, and presently I have no tool to perform
    the kind of subtable break that Karsten does for the kern feature. I had to manually
    optimise my mark feature contents to fit within a single subtable."

  body: "\"The limit is part of the basic architecture of TrueType...\"\r\n\r\nAll
    good, but it's immediately a limit on the sfnt that causes the overflow, so it's
    in the architecture of all the wrappers wrap.\r\n\r\nThe less immediate issue
    is that the gpos provides control over glyph placement for sophisticated text
    layout and the rendering of each script and language system that a font supports,
    while the kerning table contains the values that control the inter-character spacing
    for the glyphs in a font."

    feature subtable (the thing that goes boom and prompts threads like this one).\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I'm concerned the 'kern' table is a legacy data format; it's been a decade
    since I've been asked to ship a font containing one, and even then it was only
    a subset of the kerning provided in the GPOS table, and only included for backwards
    compatibility. In most of the fonts I make, the kern table simply can't do what

    working with glyph sets in which class kerning is essential to handle the number
