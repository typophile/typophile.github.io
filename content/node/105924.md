body: "Hi. I have an interest in studying type in an academic setting.\r\nThe two
  schools i have in mind for applying are, KABK and Cooper.  Anyone know if one school
  is better than the other, or pros and cons. Also, i'm from San Diego and there are
  no jobs for this type of thing. What are the most common jobs for this skill-set
  (type design). Are there jobs where you just go in and start designing type? Or
  are most jobs going to be logotype work? \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n-Etah Chen."
