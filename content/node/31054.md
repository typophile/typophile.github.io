    difference as I can see right now is the uppercase U on the Nike-font. And it
    is a little bit wider.\r\n\r\n/Mart"

  body: "Polofreaks, this isn't a file \"sharing\" site. For the most part, people
    who contribute to Typophile are creators, users and admirers of type, and believe
    that type designers deserve to get paid for their work.\r\n\r\nDo the right thing
    and shell out $20 for a legal copy of Conduit, DIN, or one of the other faces
    with a similar feel.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=DIN"
