  body: Is it kinda Optima that has been given an outline which is the same colour
    as the background and then hacked a bit (e.g. B, R)? I guess I'm asking, is it
    a real font?

  body: "There was an old film type called Stark (shown in the Phil's Photo book)
    that was very similar to this. The B was open like this, an alternate r was similar,
    but with a tail that went below the baseline. the only real disconnect is that
    Stark's M was straight-sided, and the E was more high-waisted.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    on their fashion editorials.\r\nSo, it's probably custom...\r\nThe closest is
    Young Finesse dy Doyald Young but not really..."
