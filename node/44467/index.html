  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This week has proved a typographic adventure. After designing the <a href=http://typophile.com/node/44259>Yale typeface article</a>, I had the opportunity to work on the <em><a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/>Yale Daily News</a></em>' arts and living section, “scene.” My colleague, Greta Carlson, and I designed the cover, which is traditionally highly-themed, after <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_Amman>Jost Amman</a>’s “Der Bierbreuwer” in <em>Das Ständebuch</em>. Below I’ve attached the cover and jump page for the article <a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24529>(about student beer brewing at Yale)</a>, along with a close-up of the cover. 

The type used is <a href=http://kltf.de/kltf_litteratra.htm>Litteratra Basic</a> for the headlines, subheads, and page 1 text; <a href=http://p22.com/lanston/goudytext.html>LTC Goudy Text Lombardic Caps</a> for the initials; and a slightly bigger size of our standard text type, <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/MillerDaily>Miller Daily Grade 3</a>, for the jump's text. 

As with the Yale typeface article thread, criticism is welcome, though naught can be altered now. Two problems I see are that the first initial “S” should have been nudged up a tad, and the justification is a bit wonky (owing to my turning off hyphenation because of the problems test readers had with Litteratra’s hyphen).

		<div class="commentbody">Nice spread of matching illustration and text. I like the colors used. The designer of Litteratra, Karsten Luecke will be pleased with this use of his beautiful font. He is a member of Typophile where he is known as k.l.

In the Middle Ages I was art editor of my university newspaper and have fond memories of clunky Linotype machines casting hot lead lines of letterpress that are then set into a matrix, inked and a paper proof made. If one of us hardworking students finds a mistake that line is tossed back into the machine, melted and cast again. The illustrations were made by another process whereby an acid bath eats away portions of a photographically-exposed zinc plate leaving the lines or screen dots that will be printed. No hissing sounds or acrid smell of hot lead as we now move mouse on mousepad, is there!? Great!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the responses. Thomas, you know I didn't even consider whether the Lombardic Caps were sympathetic; my logic was pretty much "a fraktur book needs illuminated versals." But now that you mention it, they are maybe a bit too finely drawn for the page. If only I had bought Litteratra Complete I could have used the titling alternates ...

Vladimir, I was aware that Karsten Luecke is a fellow typophile. I may e-mail  him about this, too. And I have actually done a bit of work with actual metal type, but it was already cast, not Linotype; the amount of time involved just to print a paragraph makes me quite thankful for InDesign, though the manual method did have its advantages.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you're referring to just using Litteratra as a basic drop cap, I did try that, but the weight increase was so much that they dominated the whole page (it is a modern <em>black</em>letter, after all ;-) ). I was referring to the titling alternates present in the OpenType Litteratra Complete; I just bought the basic version, so I couldn't access what appear to be these lighter, more refined forms that might have been ideal.</div>

I agree, Reed, computers make it incredibly easy to see and create good design. What in the old days could be only achieved through cumbersome effort that took days and weeks is now done in minutes and hours by typing and slight wrist motions. The challenge now is to find one's way to what makes the best use of the rich embarrasment of choices available to almost anyone. You seem to be fully aware of the need of restraint and precision and to keep a critical eye on the work.  I guess nowadays there is the same difference between good and bad design as there ever was,  but now there is so much of both!  Sorry I am not expressing this very well...keep up the good work.</div>
