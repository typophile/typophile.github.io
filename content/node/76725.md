  everybody first.\r\nNow, back to my question: I use Minion Pro with XeLaTex in order
  to get Serbian localized glyphs which otherwise neither OpenOffice Writer nor Microsoft
  Word would provide me with. But I get a tight kerning when the letters u+0423 CYRILLIC
  CAPITAL LETTER U and u+0431 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER BE meet each other. Please notice
  that the tight kerning only happens with the localized Serbian glyph, while the
  standard (Russian) one doesn't show any kerning problem.\r\nI attached a .pdf with
  the relevant example. Could you please suggest me a way to solve this annoying flaw
  in an otherwise wonderful font?\r\nThank you everybody."

    supports language-specific OpenType glyph selection.  For more info see:\r\n\r\nhttp://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/11/firefox-4-font-feature-support/\r\n\r\nI
    included a Serbian example to demonstrate this."

  body: "Thank you for answering me, jdagett. I'm experiencing a problem of kerning,
    not of rendering. Rendering & kerning work wonderfully with, say, Constantia.
    Furthermore, the sample text you provided me with didn't include the relevant
    combination of characters (u+0423 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER U and u+0431 CYRILLIC
    SMALL LETTER BE).\r\nAnyhow, I'm glad to learn that at last we'll get a browser
    compliant with OpenType. At the Serbian Wikipedia we have long awaited for a solution
    that would make it possible to display the correct Serbian glyphs without resorting
    to non-standard proprietary fonts. Still, unfortunately support for Serbian glyphs
    is lacking in the world of free fonts, and MinionPro, one of the best candidates
    for usage in the Serbian Wikipedia, deceives us with such a gross flaw!!!"

  body: "Hi Alessandro. Welcome to Typophile. I did open Minion Pro (both versions
    2.68 and 2.30) in FontLab and the kerning setting seems to be correct. Although
    there is a negative kerning, it is adequate to the glyph pair and far from the
    collision we see in your PDF:\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_11272010_172936_5724.gif]\r\n.\r\nI
    also did a test within InDesign and it seems to run ok:\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_11272010_174125_6638.gif]\r\nSorry
    not to test in XeLaTex, but I don't know it.\r\n.\r\nSo I believe you may be using
    an older version of Minion Pro with a small bug in kerning table or there is some
    setting in XeLaTex which is causing this."

  body: 'Wow Freiberger!!! Your kerning is correct!!! My version is the one included
    with AcrobatReader: 2.068 and dates 2004. Maybe yours, 2.34 and 2.68 are later,
    commercial versions? I hope not because at the Serbian Wikipedia, now that Firefox
    4 will support OpenType, were interested in adopting MinionPro as standard font
    in order to correctly render Serbian glyphs but such kerning flaws do cast a shadow
    on an otherwise excellent font.'

  body: "I was not aware Acrobat Reader ever provided Minion Pro. The 2.30 version
    was included in Fontfolio 11 (2007) and the 2.68 version came with Adobe CS5 (2010).
    Although it's commercially available, it will also be installed with any trial
    of Creative Suite 5. I found my old version 1.1 file, from 2000, and it does not
    includes uni0431.ital (version 2.68 has 443 more glyphs than version 1.1).\r\n\r\nIf
    you plan to use it at web, the new technologies to embed fonts would allow your
    users to see the updated version \u2013 so the problem will not occur. If you
    need it for print, you can edit the font and fix the kerning (Adobe EULA permits
    it) or simply get an updated file."

  body: "Version 2000 was the first version I tried and it its implementation of OpenType
    was particularly buggy and fickle. It did contain the Serbian glyphs but not in
    the expected position, therefore XeLaTex triggers didn't work so the glyphs at
    issue had to be accessed manually... a mess. Version 2004 ships with Acrobat Reader
    9 and is way better but apparently still has kerning flaws. Does it constitute
    an offense if I ask you to mail me the 2010 version? Obviously only if the font
    can be freely distributed.\r\nIt is difficult for me to install a Windows program
    like CS5 because I actually use Ubuntu 10.10 and Wine (the compatibility layer)
    is a disaster as far as Creativity & Office programs are concerned.\r\nAnyway,
    thank you for having rescued me: now I know I just need an updated font."

    included in the package. You may use them just during the trial period.

  body: OK, I got it, the problem lies in Latex, not in the 2004 version of Minion
    Pro. I tried with Pango View in Ubuntu 10.10 and 2004 version of Minion, I processed
    the given input (u+0423 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER U and u+0431 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER
    BE) and I got a correct kerning, no flaws, everything is all right! So, Latex
    is to blame here.
