body: "I have a licensed, PS-flavored, OpenType font family that is showing up in
  menus and in Linotype Font Explorer as 6 separate families, one family for each
  variant ( roman, italic, bold, bold italic, &c. ) . The files underwent no modification
  or processing after purchase. This is most undesirable. \r\n\r\nI've tried using
  TransType Pro to combine the fonts into one family, but to no avail. I changed the
  family name and the Opentype name to match, but when I converted, it ended up exactly
  the same as before. Perhaps there's some setting I'm overlooking? Is there a common
  way to do this? \r\n"
