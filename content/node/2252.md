body: I know the answer to this must be simple but i cant find what it is.  <BR>All
  i want to do is set my InDesign so when create a new document the units and increments
  are in mm rather that points.  <BR>I know I can change this when i create the document
  through prefenences but i want the units always to be in mm when i go to create
  a document, it leads to a lot of time trying to set a proper grid, columns and gutters.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR>david.

  body: You need to set the preferences when no documents are open. If a document
    is open, the new preferences will be applied only to that document. If you set
    preferences without any documents open, the new preferences will be applied to
    any new documents.

    <BR> <BR>Are you sure?  I could swear the units stay the same for any document
    once you set them regardless of whether one is open or not? <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    have to try it out one day.'

  body: Document preferences are saved with a document. So existing documents will
    retain the preferences they had, regardless of whether you change the global preferences
    when no documents are open. The global preferences affect <i>new</i> documents.

  body: David one of the things I like about Adobe products is you can control&#40;key&#41;
    click on the rulers and a dialog box comes down and gives you options to change
    ruler settings on the fly.
