  body: "Just a suggestion on how to get more responses.\r\nPhotos of building inscriptions
    accompanied by city or country and an idea of the date of construction are more
    likely to jog memory of font designers & the fonts they designed. \r\nIn this
    case the language and style makes me suspect Germany or Austria between 1900 &
    1930. \r\nI do recall some fonts with the these general letterforms. But nothing
    specific comes to mind. \r\nSome digging at:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/austria-index.html\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/germany-index.html\r\nmight
    be fruitful.\r\nDon"
