    already. For some reason unknown this thread, for example, appears in my \"Recent

    Sans Family?</a>.\r\n\r\nAs with all older threads -- dug up deliberately by some
    Johnny-come-lately, risen from the ashes because of a misdirected Google search,
    or brought back to life by a mischievous spammer -- I cannot help wondering if
    this guy ever found his personal Holy Grail o'Fonts, or just went ahead and became
    an accountant, woodworker, or Adobe Helpdesk operator, got married, fathered two
    children, and never thought back on his whimsical post on a Typophile's hangout.
    (Probably not the part about marrying as that thread is just 2 years old.)"

  body: "Happy birthday Typophile!\r\n\r\nThree life-changing Typophile experiences\u2014so
    far. Here's the first one. \r\n\r\nIn discussing Caslon back in 2003 with Kent
    Lew, John Hudson, Gerald Giampa (alas no longer with us), and Hrant, [[http://typophile.com/node/436#comment-2774|John
    Hudson pointed out that Adobe Caslon]] is \"Sadly, Adobe Caslon is the only version
    that is suited to a wide range of typographic application, but it doesn't look
    like Caslon, so what's the point?\"\r\n\r\nBeing already a \"typomaniac,\" but
    not a designer, I remembered reading Einstein's Autobiography in the Schilpp volumes,
    and remembered with fondness its letter press Linotype Caslon Old Face. And I
    thought \"Wait a minute, I know what Caslon looks like. I think I could do that
    right.\"\r\n\r\nEventually I bought FontLab, and started drawing type. And among
    many other activities in my life, I kept drawing, and kept drawing, and kept drawing.
    \r\n\r\nFast forward to today. My <em>Williams Caslon Text</em> (Font Bureau)
    is one of the fonts chosen to be in the 10-year retrospective exhibition of graphic
    design at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City, [[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/now-in-production|Now
    in Production]], starting May 26 in New York City. It looks like there will be
    a 'type night' when several type designers will be talking, including me, but
    a date is not yet set. "
