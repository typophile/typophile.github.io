  florin sign from the afrolatin ccharacter 0192. To proof this issue we\u2019d like
  to present some sample images of the florin\u2019s usage in print. Does anyone have
  something at hand?"

  body: "This is indeed a problematic unification, bit disunification can be even
    more problematic, as we discovered with the Romanian diacritics. In which direction
    would you disunify? What would be the identity of the existing codepoint? -- bearing
    in mind that it is part of ISO Latin 1 as the florin, and widely implemented as
    such in fonts, but has normative case folding to the uppercase F-hook?\r\n\r\nI
    believe a significant identity shift is already beginning to take place vis \xE0
    vis this character. As more font support extended Latin character sets including
    support for African languages, the obvious implementation of this character is
    as f-hook, rather than as the florin symbol. We've already started changing the
    implementation in fonts for MS as we extend the character set to support African
    language. And of course the demise of the Dutch currency in favour of the euro
    makes this change easier."

  body: "Though the Dutch florin has been obsolesced by the euro, aren't there other
    countries that use a currency called \"florin\", whether or not the same symbol
    is used? Something in my mind says there is at least one, but I can't pull it
    out.\r\n\r\nIf not, the remaining future use of the florin symbol will be largely
    limited to texts on Dutch financial history and other period pieces, e.g.: a romantic
    comedy set in a Rotterdam grocery store in 1987, which a careful editor can easily
    fake with an italic <em>f</em> with hook from future disambiguated fonts."
