  latin letters (a, b, c, etc.) are optimized to be written by hand, they take up
  a lot of unnecessary space. Your eyes have to move at a frantic pace from left to
  right to read. The letters in Dotsies words smoosh together, so words look like
  shapes! Get more screen space! Save paper. Have a more comfortable reading experience</em>

  body: Wow. I've seen dozens of weird attempts at writing reform, but this is easily
    the most confusing. How on earth do they even begin to expect this to improve
    reading speed? :o

  body: "I know this is an old post but I like to respond. Dotsies is far too complex
    to remember. I think it would be a real challenge to teach this to young children.
    Also, can you imagine checking a dotsies text for grammar?\r\n\r\nIn the sample
    on the dotsies page going from text to dotsies, I have a lot of problems reading
    beyond the 4th line. Who said being more economical with space helps readability
    anyway?\r\n\r\n\"It's easier than you think. There are only 26 letters. Numbers
    and punctuation aren't altered. You've probably learned more than 26 things in
    a single hour-long class or lecture.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think the issue is the amount
    of letters or even our memory capacity necessarily, but rather the fact that it's
    very hard to distinguish letters from each other. This is a lot of fun for people
    with dyslexia I can imagine.\r\n\r\nRussell, your typeface looks half Asian. I
    like it. It's hard to read but it looks cool. Is this font available by any chance?"

  body: "Very cool. Can anyone tell me what the third line in the orange picture on
    MyFonts is supposed to say though? Almost intuitively I read abracadabra (and
    the word 'magical' in the next line seems to confirm this) but what I actually
    read is acrbcadarbnd. Is this a mistake?\r\n\r\nAlso, in the description an apostrophe
    was missed in \"Its\" [normally calm]."

    that picture, but it's different. That picture says acbrcadabra (with black letters)
    while the one on MyFonts says acbrcadabrnd (with white letters).\r\n\r\nIs someone
    having difficulty typing abracadabra? Considering the nature of this typeface
    the typos really add to the confusion."

  body: I think many wouldn't even have noticed the mistake. As I said, I almost intuitively
    read 'abracadabra', or deduced it from the range and positions of letters I saw.
    Still, Russell might consider fixing the mistakes as it would look more professional
    and avoid confusion about what the typeface does.
