body: "So, as a sort of oddity I'm adding fists/manicules to my latest typeface and
  I figured arrows would be handy as well. Now, I have them mapped with the appropriate
  unicodes as far as possible. To make them more accessible I figured I would create
  a stylistic set so you can type >> to make an arrow. However, when I add the code
  and I click on compile OpenType program it tells me it has to abort because of errors.\r\n\r\nI
  must be doing something wrong. How do you usually map these kind of symbols to OT
  functions, or don't you?\r\n\r\nfeature ss07 { # Stylistic Set 7\r\n # DEFAULT\r\n\t\tsub

    understand what that might mean. I have a stylistic set where I replace I J with
    an IJ digraph and it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nBy the way, should I be using the
    backslash in the features or was that just to denote the glyphs to be replaced?"

  body: It has been working for me without the backslash, but I guess I better start
    using it. Although, what kind of keywords might it conflict with?

  body: "It seems unnecessarily cautious to use backslashes routinely. Especially
    given that there are no standard glyph names that are also OpenType feature keywords.
    \ \r\n\r\nIt is handy in the unlikely case that you need to name a glyph something
    like \"sub\" or \"lookup\", but if you do happen to use a keyword as a glyph name,
    the compiler will complain, letting you know to use a backslash (or a different
    name). \r\n\r\nBut, no need to do it all the time preemptively, unless you want
    to. "

  body: Agreed with cerulean, stylistic sets are not supposed to contain ligatures.
    Also agreed that if you were going to do this as a ligation, 'dlig' would be appropriate.

  body: By the way, how do you handle the fact that some software just have no way
    to access the OT features in a certain way? There are some differences between
    the Typography panels from Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. In some cases
    you need stylistic sets while in other cases you can't access them. That's why
    I created a few extra stylistic sets so some of the rather standard OT functions
    can still be accessed in all software.

  body: "It's a classic catch-22. The app makers (e.g., Adobe) need to support this
    stuff better, but they don't because they say users aren't asking for it. Users
    aren't asking for it because, since the apps don't support it, they don't know
    it exists. Given this situation, workarounds are understandable, but we would
    all be better off if the basic problem were resolved. \r\n\r\nThere's a petition
    effort going on right now to (hopefully) address this. You might be interested:\r\n\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/2014/10/25/why-a-better-opentype-user-interface-matters/"

  body: "Oh I'm definitely interested.\r\n\r\nI agree with your statement, but I also
    wonder despite whether we're interested in it or not, why the typography panels
    need to be different anyway. InDesign's typography panel has just about everything.
    I think they more or less know users want more options, because in Photoshop CC
    there's finally access to OT functions, though the glyphs window is still not
    included. I just see no practical reason for making these panels different in
    all three programs. I guess they have been developed independently, but since
    a few years now they ought to be the same, based on InDesign's typography panel."
