  \"borrowing\" from his brand's look. So in that spirit, I built this quick flash
  app to make your own Obama-style graphics!\r\n\r\nLink: http://rocdove.com/blog/obama-graphic-generator/109\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  thought typophiles might get a kick out of it. If you come up with something clever,
  post it! I'd love to see what other people come up with.\r\n\r\n-Brendan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/changethistext_3737.jpg]\r\n(my

    on the main blog url, but not on the permalink. So if you tried it before and
    it didn't work, it should work now."

  body: "Ok, it's killed. I guess it was fun while it lasted, at least for me ;-)\r\n\r\nYeah,
    I couldn't get flash to bring in the kerning information (didn't spend too much
    time on this thought, so there might be a way).\r\n\r\nTrue, the gotham/gradients
    look was around before the campaign, but I feel like it's really taken off since
    Obama adopted it. Sort of like how Apple didn't invent putting a reflection under
    everything, but it took off after they started doing it. That's how it seems to
    me anyway.\r\n\r\n"

    or better yet asking H&FJ for permission. I didn't intend to spoil the fun :-(

    on the forum than get someone more serious on my case.

    PDF exhibit a paranoia that is unbecoming of digital citizenship. \r\n\r\nI'm
    saying this without having read the H&FJ EULA. Asking permission is probably your
    best bet."

  body: I re-read Sii's original comment and then I had to go read the actual EULA.
    It clearly describes an exception to the no embedding portion of the agreement.
    It allows you to use it for basic Flash (SWF) files, not the dynamic use that
    your generator requires. (Kudos to H&FJ for having a helpful FAQ to accompany
    their EULA.)
