  logo. I'm making a printable certificate for a test that provides P.A.C.E. certification,
  and this is the resolution of the logo they provided. I'm trying to recreate the
  stamp using vectors, but I've hit a wall with the font.\r\n\r\nHere it is in context
  of the full stamp.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.labce.com/license.aspx\r\n\r\nThe 'A' is pretty
  unique with the slight curved slopes, so I thought it wouldn't be so hard to find,
  but I've come up with nothing so far.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."
