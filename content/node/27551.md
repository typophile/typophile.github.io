  three W\xB4s. Those characters will never space nicely and they don\xB4t give any
  information anyway. So therefore I thought of a new sign, a new character, to replace
  `WWW\xB4. And it looks like this\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/world

    in modern communication which could be replaced bij somekind of \"ligature\".
    What about 'fax', 'tel' or perhaps even labels on forms and businesscards 'name',
    'Adress', 'Country'. What happens in other languages? Are there any Japanese or
    Arabic solutions to this?"

  body: "Thanks for the thread. Very interesting. But everybody's writing nice options
    without much real visual proposals. The large W with the two small w's beside
    is nice, but not a serious option in my view, because it takes up too much space.
    A W combined with a 3 is a thought, but remember that people should always have
    the option to use three w's instead of the new sign.\r\n\r\nOne of the comments
    had me thinking. Wouldn't it be a nice idea to use a very simple globe as a sign
    for the world (!) wide web?\r\n\r\nCheers"

    finding a replacement i've just started dropping this useless bit of info from
    all stationary etc that i designed. If you set contact info, it is just so obvious
    isn't it? ie. if it says typophile.com , what else then a web address could it
    be?\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\nPS> Although your www ligature is visually quite pleasing

    that we can simply drop the www and go with the straight \".com\" name and not
    miss a beat. But in those cases where \"www\" is required I think your ligature
    will work beautifully. This should be implemented into font character sets. Heck,
    it's not only functional and clear, but it also looks very stylish. "

    is indeed present. But still it has a function. It is indicating that a web adress
    is following. Just like the at-sign is always a part of an email adress and immediately
    recognisable. Therefore a single character might even be stronger than three characters.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    still interested in the sans version? (I chose Frutiger for this purpose.)\r\n"

    publishing guidelines for how people can make this glyph in any font they are

    I agree, though technically speaking, this isn't necessarily true.\r\n\r\nAn email
    address must have an @ sign. \r\n\r\nA URL doesn't have to have the www at all,
    and, these days, most competant sysadmins know enough not to require the www to
    get to one's web site.\r\n\r\nAs such, I'd agree that the solution to the problem
    is to just drop the www altogether. I think the presence of a .com/org/net/etc
    is enough to clearly indicate a URL these days."

    are right. URL can indeed exist without the 'www'. But as far as I know most top
    level URLs, the ones mentioned on ads, do start with 'www'.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the
    sign might still help in saving space and also help in making it look a little
    better.\r\n\r\nTo find out if the sign would still work on a sans font, I did
    a Frutiger version. It might look like this, though I'm not complete satisfied,
    because the inner w's do not have the same nice proportions as in the serif version.

    of the time. It's just an old habit. And if the old habit is 'ugly' then the solution,
    IMHO, is to drop it. And I do see a lot more folks dropping the www. in their
    marketing. Off the top of my head, my 4 year old walks around the house singing
    'pbs kids dot org' each morning. \r\n\r\nNot that this isn't an interesting challenge.
    It is, and is fun, but I'm not sure how practical it actually is in real world
    use. Is it more useful to have an odd looking glyph that might take a second look
    to fully understand or to just drop it altogether?\r\n\r\n"
