body: "Hello typophiles. First sorry about my bad english. Recently I bought on an
  eBay auction, the book  Concionum Opus Tripartitum. It was printed in Cologne by
  Johannes Kinchius in 1646 . The typefaces used in this book intrigues me. I can
  found 3 different styles. Roman, italic an a fraktur. The roman and italics used
  in text looks like a Garamond (or like) cut. I'm right?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/rafaelneder/sets/72157613836514820|For

  body: I can't say for sure, but I think Kinchius either cut his own fonts or had
    somebody cut them for him. Somebody here would likely know for sure. Most of the
    roman fonts in use at that time look something like Garamonds, but there were
    a number of different ones. The largest sizes on that title page, however, don't
    look like any Garamond I've ever seen, so I am quite sure they are by someone
    else. The text font could very well be a Garamond.
