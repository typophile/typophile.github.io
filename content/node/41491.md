  body: "Hey Stefan, \r\n\r\nThanks for that! Thats interesting that someone in New
    Zealand is using it.\r\n\r\nI guess the reason it doesn't appeal to me is the
    spurs of the lowercase 'm' and 'n', and tail's of the 'a' and 'd'.\r\n\r\nThats
    just a personal thing \u2013 I don't really like Enigma either. I go for more...
    hmmm classic faces with not so much flare to them (Arnhem, Meta Serif) real work-horses.
    But of course most of the time it depends on the typographer rather than whether
    or not the type is good or bad.\r\n\r\nThanks though! :)\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "Duncan,\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply. Delicato is somehow a bit of an experiment.
    I wanted to see how personal I could make a typeface intended for body copy in
    books etc and still keep it \"classic\". It works in smaller sizes of course.
    I've done some other more \"traditional\" text faces like Tarocco and Anziano
    which might look more attractive for your taste?\r\n\r\nBtw did you see Delicato
    used in a local magazine or what. I would be happy to know the name of the magazine
    in order to be able to check out the result.\r\n\r\nCheers"
