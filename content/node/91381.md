  I will be using as my main example for experiment on the thread about <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/91109\">Multiple
  \"cuts\" of one typeface</a>. The initial idea for this came from some vague Xavier
  Dupr\xE9 inspiration, although that's not very evident here,  and sketching. In
  fact, I'd like to get a somewhat organic and \"drawn\" feeling.\r\n\r\nI vaguely
  had in my head something of \"classic\" printing types also, likes ones in books
  I own printed 1970 and earlier. Like Baskerville, Kis, Dante, Caledonia, Sabon,
  Fournier, Electra, and Times. Although the digital versions of these just don't
  look like they do in old books; they are much lighter and crisper. Alpine likely
  does not very much resemble any of those, as I haven't looked at them much during
  my process. (Except to read my old books!)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/Alpine-20120323-small.png\"

    href=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/Alpine-20120401.png\">Larger image</a>\r\n\r\nHere's
    another update. I've tried to fix most of the things you guys have mentioned.
    I'm also experimenting with wedge baseline serifs for the 'd' and 'u', is it working?
    I hope I'm not being to radical with some of the uppercase. I'm going to have
    to work on the 'R' for sure.\r\n\r\nI decided to remove most inside serifs in
    an attempt to improve <em>notan</em> aspects. I was originally thinking removing
    the bottom left serifs would improve it. It <em>does</em> make an interesting
    interlocking pattern, but it doesn't help the word image at all, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/bouma.jpg\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/notan-counters.png\"
    />\r\n\r\nOf course, it really looks unusual. I think it would probably trip me
    up in running text. Also, the counters don't really <em>look</em> like anything.
    In a way it's visually messy. I had thought about this, and as I said, I decided
    that I should remove the inside facing serifs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/notan-counters2.png\"
    />\r\n\r\nI realized it would be excellent for two reasons: 1) this helps reinforce
    the relation ship between letters, which is what <em>word image</em> is all about.
    2) the counter form actually <em>looks</em> like a simplified 'n'. Other similar
    letters will do the same. So except in the case where the serif is needed for
    color or helps make it \"work\" better, I'll be removing inner serifs. The serifs
    also seem to create a fairly even, rhythmic line, except where the counters are
    opened up. I think this also helps recognition of letterforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had
    been thinking of this before the thread came up, about emphasizing the most important
    parts in the recognition of glyphs. http://typophile.com/node/91645 The research
    of Frederic Gosselin is fascinating, although I think it's fairly obvious to most
    of us here. For one thing, from the outset I made a large hood on the 'f'. I'm
    thinking I may try reworking the 'a' based on that research as well.\r\n\r\n<b>On
    the Hebrew:</b> Trying and get a handle on the relative proportions for everything
    as early as possible. If able, I want to make the Hebrew and Latin share any vertical
    metrics they can, however not much works there. Maybe I can relate the flag of
    the <em>lamed</em> to the Latin accents. This current Hebrew might be too playful
    to really work in text, as well, but I'm working on it. I'll be doing print tests
    as soon as I get enough glyphs finished for it to really mean something. Text
    at medium-to-small sizes is what I'm going for.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/Alpine-20120401-f.jpg\"
    />\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Not sure if a /v/ like that works...</blockquote>\r\nI'm
    not either! Actually, that's the first time I've ever made one like that. Sometimes
    you just get peculiar ideas about how letters can be built when you've spent too
    much time playing with them. Thanks for the input btw Jasper.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>/a/
    needs work.</blockquote>\r\nWhat exactly do you think the problem is? :)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    thanks to Martin Silvertant who gave me some much needed input on <a href=\"http://fav.me/d4uigkw\">dA</a>."

  body: Not sure if the 'z' fits the othjer letters but I love the design. It's a
    bit awkward but I like that; its quirkiness reminds me of Gill Sans. The symmetrical
    baseline serifs in h/m/n is pushing it too far in my opinion though and the contrast
    in these letters is higher than in other letters.

  body: "Brian, thanks for inviting me to comment on this design.\r\n\r\nI think you're
    doing a number of things right. I like the\r\nnarrowness, the vertical proportions,
    the color and most\r\nof all your lack of fear in terms of not clinging to a tired\r\nblack-marking
    method - you're thinking of what this\r\nneeds to be doing, as opposed to where
    it's supposed to\r\nbe coming from.\r\n\r\nIt is however probably a bit too tight.\r\n\r\nI
    love seeing the black pushed around to allow the white\r\nto sing in unison. As
    you're seeing it's tricky though. But\r\ndon't worry too much about breaking any
    of the clich\xE9\r\nrules - especially in immesive reading they become really\r\npointless.
    Also don't be afraid of being a little Po-Mo; it's\r\nentirely human to be unsure,
    and type is for humans.\r\n\r\nBTW, that large \"n\" in your most recent post
    make me\r\nthink you should look at FF Avance. Keep in my though\r\nthat Evert
    was a Modernist.\r\n\r\nFor the Hebrew, I can only offer tentative observations,\r\nbut
    it does seem to me that it can't fully inherit the Latin's\r\nnarrowness. Your
    vertical proportions seem to make good\r\nsense though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    The PDF has some pangrams as well as actual text setting. No numerals yet. The
    name has also now been changed to <em>Hemlock</em>. I like that name better, more
    about that is at the end of the first post.\r\n\r\n<strong>Some notes:</strong>\r\nz:
    it is a bit quirky. I haven't printed my test pages yet so I don't really know
    how well it will work.\r\nn,m,h: Martin had said on dA that it looks a bit like
    a man standing with his legs far apart and feet to the sides. I've found that
    I think the size of the gap is distracting, so I've condensed these letters a
    bit.\r\ncaps: I'm having a bit of trouble with the proportions right now, so bear
    with me.\r\n\r\nI don't want to make this too old-fashioned, but make a contemporary
    design with the warmth of old metal book faces. So bear that in mind. Hopefully
    the spacing is better than before, although I'm not at a point where I can start
    kerning yet.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hemlock-20120413_6021.png]\r\n\r\nOne
    last thing: I need to set Hemlock aside so I can focus on Neuton. So I may be
    neglecting this thread for a while."
