body: "I have broken my own record for useless type. I am working on a project that
  requires a long legalese statement that \"has to be there\".\r\n\r\nThe last piece
  I did was at 2 points - to make it \"readable\" I allowed for auto leading. Bringhurst
  would be proud.\r\n\r\nMy previous record was 2.7 points or something like that.
  \r\n\r\nIt is an implication, not a statement - and I sort of like that. If only
  all the other useless \"information\" could be set in such a glorious setting.\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nMy
  mind is subject to change without notice. I am usually the last to know."

  body: While you sneer at something as inconsequential as people's rights and obligations,
    you should hear what the legal world generally thinks of the importance of the
    type in which such trivialities are presented!

    type designers go to sneer?
