  post ever. I admire and respect you guys already and the work that you do. I know
  I have a lot to learn, and that's why I'm here.</em>\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried
  to find something and realized that Google is completely useless when you have <strong>no
  idea</strong> what the thing is called, and not the slightest inkling of where to
  begin?\r\n\r\nWell, I got lucky and stumbled upon one example today: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/word-logos\"
  target=\"new52\">Brothers Word Logos</a>. But I hate to think this might be the
  only example out there. I'm looking for fonts that contain prefab ornamental <em>AND</em>'s
  and <em>THE</em>'s, even if the typeface is perhaps a bit kitchy. \r\n\r\nI read
  that some excellent fonts for making your own <em>The</em>'s include OPTI Sport
  Script, MVB Mascot, Metroscript, Machiarge, Fenway Park, Univers, and Trade Gothic
  (Links on <a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/uses/15/the-chop-shop\" target=\"new53\">this
  page</a>) but I'm a sucker for the embellishments, sometimes even just simple lines
  above and below, that are characteristic of these ornaments, and if I try to make
  them myself and tailor them to the style, my results vary.\r\n\r\nSo my question
  is, <strong>Do you know of any other fonts out there with prefab THE & AND ornaments,
  like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/word-logos\" target=\"new52\">Brothers
  Word Logos</a>, and can you help a brother out?</strong> Also, what are your favorite
  type ornament fonts? (I'm indebted to <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/old-foundry-prints-tfb.font?fpp=100\"
  target=\"new54\">Old Foundry Prints TFB</a>) Thanks so much for your time!\r\n\r\n<em>A
  bit of background for the curious: What I'm obsessed with is letterpress, real (imitation)
  wood type, the Nashville style, and concert posters. If I had my own letterpress
  machine and a warehouse full of wooden typesets I would never come out. But as it
  is, I'm resigned to strive for ballpark accuracy in a digital format for the concert
  posters I produce. I shy away from \"distressed\" and \"grunge\" fonts because I'd
  rather add character myself, and I'm a recovering Egyptian/Circus/Western font addict.</em>"
