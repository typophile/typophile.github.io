<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm doing what in some ways may be my first "real" typographic job - the layout of a 194-page book. I could use some suggestions for typefaces. <br> <br>Subject: herbal remedies and "high-tech" aromatherapy techniques <br> <br>My client wants a "modern and high-tech" look, which I will achieve partly through layout and secondary fonts. <br> <br>Text fonts I'm currently considering include: Scala, Raleigh, Stone, Minion, Apollo <br> <br>I would consider others, but price may be an issue if a given font is expensive for my client. <br> <br>Any recommendations or analyses of these fonts' strengths is appreciated. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Scala is OK, although overused. <br>Don't use Raleigh or Stone. Please. <br>Minion is boring (except if you're gonna milk its MM axes). <br>Apollo is an interesting departure, but too stodgy here. <br> <br>To me "modern and high-tech" implies a certain honest, rigid feel, so I would go with a wedge serif design, like FF Zine, Foundry Form Serif or FF Olson. If your text will be smallish, consider Swift as well. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Think I figured it out.

<div class=commentbody>I admire Meridien, but I think it's too old-school for this job - its serifs are wedge, but too sharp - plus I think it's too lyrical to be modern. <br> <br>As for the nice combo Stephen mentions (sans Trajan, though), the secret third component -for any heavy text- is Kepler. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to point out that this sort of thing is a little like going on-line and saying "I have a fever, my throat is sore, and I have small rashes on my skin. What would you guys recommend that I take for it?" Beware any diagnosis over the internet. <br> <br>Obviously, there's a lot more to choosing a book face than just what looks interesting. And without a lot more details about the book brief ('modern and high-tech' are very vague terms and could mean a lot of different things to different people, including your client, these suggestions are only stabs in the dark. <br> <br>Nevertheless, let me offer my two cents' worth: <br> <br>Scala has turned out to be a decent face in books. It's spareness gives a character that many would characterize as contemporary. As Hrant points out, the downside is that it is a bit heavily exposed right now -- but that's not really a primary consideration in book text. I have found it tricky to pair a good display with it because of it's idiosyncracies. And although I've considered it for a couple jobs before, I've yet to actually decide to use it. <br> <br>Stone and Minion are both solid workhorses. I've used both with success. (I just finished a book with Stone). But I suspect neither is unique enough to give the character that your client seems to be requesting. <br> <br>Apollo is a good text face, although I find setting it requires a little more care in handling. Utopia and Kepler both set well right out of the box. Although all three are more unique, uncommon choices, I don't think any of these are going to give the character you want. I think they're all a little too soft and classical in feeling for what you're describing. Apollo feels very oldstyle and usually gives a delicate text. Utopia yields a fairly dark setting and seems a bit too squarish for what I think you might be after -- it seems better suited to manuals and textbooks than trade books. Kepler is a nice readable Didone, being a more jovial take on the class, but I don't think it is sharp enough to convey "modern, high-tech" (whatever that actually means). <br> <br>I haven't worked with Avance or the other FF faces mentioned, so I can't speak from direct experience. I think Avance might make a nice text, but it does seem a little congenial for your title. I don't think I could advise either Olsen or Zine as book faces. Olsen is very monotone and the x-height seems too large for extended text; I'm sure it's a fine 'jobbing' face. Zine looks interesting, but I only see a Display cut, which is too narrow for book text in my opinion. (I hope Sch</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wise words from Mr. Lew. <br> <br>Just don't use ITC Stone <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> I agree with Hrant, there's something really fishy with those pulpy terminals. I designed a book last year and ITC Stone was forced upon me by the corporate style manual. And to top it all off, I had to use Helvetica for headlines! Me, using ITC Stone <i>AND</i> Helvetica on the same job! Argh... (The book was a success though. Oh, the irony of it all.)</div>
