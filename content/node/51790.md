    it takes so long to load the page with all the great potential Typophile logos.

  body: "Jupiterboy-\r\nWhy do you think avoiding red is such a bad idea?\r\n\r\nI
    would suggest keeping the red in--or a shade of red--as a secondary or tertiary
    color in the overall brand.\r\n\r\nIn times of recession, as we are now, red tends
    to take on new meaning in the eye of an average American consumer, and as such,
    red would not be a good choice for a primary color.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of a re-brand
    and presenting the consumer with the idea that circuit city isn't completely new
    (after all, they're still 'circuit city'), keeping red in some way would be advisable.
    It would certainly help in positioning the brand with longevity in mind- which
    is something recession-scared consumers highly value."
