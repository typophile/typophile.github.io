  out of the design loop for awhile (having a baby and being a mum!) means I'm rusty
  on most things. (Though its coming back, the old 'its like riding a bike analogy!)
  I was wondering whether any of you have mini projects that you do to keep your creative
  juices flowing and whether you cared to share what you did? \r\n\r\nI keep a journal
  of creative thought, so if something inspires me I document it, I tend to write
  a fair amount and then typeset that but I was just interested in something a bit
  quicker and would help me find my footing again! \r\n\r\n\r\nRed."

    and fine art, but for design type mini projects I'll do logos for myself or redesign
    my website (maybe one reason it is a permanent work in progress)... Stuff like
    that. Since coming here though, it's typefaces... So, be careful :o) \r\n\r\nR"

    I know how addictive type gets! I've not had a chance to get around to sorting
    out my website. It's on that list of other things to do which gets bigger by the
    day.\r\n\r\nRed.\r\n "

    have a baby now!:\r\n\r\n - get the baby's blog set up\r\n - design some posters
    for the baby's room\r\n - design some wooden toys for the baby (letter blocks!)\r\n
    - the kid needs a logo, right?\r\n - start getting some baby onesies with type
    designs on it printed at an online shop\r\n - Type sculpture mobile\r\n - type
    stencils for the baby room\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nTbh, my main point of this post was to see if people did their own projects
    outside of their work time and how they got their creative juices flowing? At
    the time of my first post I had just applied to do my MA and had spent a fair
    bit 'lurking' here. \r\n\r\nRed."
