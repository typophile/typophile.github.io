  body: Script fonts are the hardest I should think, especially when so many are available
    for free. Perhaps you could post an screen capture?

    horizontal distortion in the original video (it seems it was squished by about
    40-45%).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/catch_release_3580.png]"

  body: I cannot seem to find a match, BUT ITC Studio script is close, as is Laramie
    Pro. Strangely enough it looks very very familiar..but I cannot place it.

  body: "I'm pretty sure it was done as a font. But I suppose it could have been done
    as a completely custom job for the film titles.\r\n\r\nThere certainly are lots
    of typefaces in this general space (some of the other closer ones being Wendy
    from LetterPerfect, Professor from Three Islands Press, Shimmer from Blue Vinyl,
    Freestyle Script), I'm just not finding a really close match. I tried Identifont,
    tried MyFonts \"more fonts like this\" feature on Studio Script and looked at
    660 other fonts... nada. Sigh.\r\n\r\nSo I'm just hoping somebody will recognize
    the darn thing.  :/\r\n\r\nT"
