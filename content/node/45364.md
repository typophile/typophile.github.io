  briefly-by saying that I'm Paul Lloyd, and that some of you may have come across
  my past efforts on the Typoasis site.  \r\n\r\nWhen I look back at them some are
  better than others but we all learn over time.  Anyway, I'm trying to get a bit
  more serious about things these days, and I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts
  on my latest project, a modern serif face called 'Fleete'.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleete_6410.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FLEETE2_4821.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll

  body: "These images seem strangely soft. Why is that? \r\n\r\nYour examples of use
    are book oriented. I am not sure this is the best application for your font as
    it has been designed so far. It seems more like a display face. If you are in
    earnest about it being a book face that would color my comments quite a bit. So
    I would like to ask you about this distinction first."

    image you can have better comments, and if you want comments on the curves you
    can upload vector graphics.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Quirinus_5948.gif]"

  body: "Eben,\r\n\r\nThe softness comes from my having printed hard copy specimens,
    and then scanned them-I thought this would give a result more representative of
    the face in use.  On reflction a silly idea, I shall post some better images shortly.
    \ I'll also see about some vector graphics too. \r\n\r\n "

    make an interesting point with Quirinus- not a face I was familiar with-Fleet
    is very similar in broad outline and 'spirit' yet somehow it differs in almost
    all details.  "

  body: "I am finding the bulb at the right bottom of the e distracts me. I would
    reduce it. The upper right of the e seems too light. The gap produced by the very
    long arm of the r is also distracting. The c seems to closed. I think the tail
    of the y might benefit from having a more substantial and definitive finnish such
    as a bulb end. The same advice for the g.  The dot on the i is too light. The
    s is a nice design but for a different font. I don't think it works here. The
    ends of the z are too light and disappear. I would look at a deeper join for your
    n and m. Why are the strokes of the n,m,u having on the first vertical stroke
    be heavy and lighter afterwards? The u should not be a rotated n. \r\n\r\nOverall
    look at the characters and notice that some are far heavier than the others. Look
    at how other fonts are not like this and how they achieve and even emphasis from
    letter to letter. Example w vs, x \r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful."

  body: It reminds me a bit of some of my early work on Ruatger/Rutaban. Some very
    significant differences too, of course. Is this based on modular construction?

  body: "Cuttlefish- I wouldn't say it was modular in a formal sense, but it is true
    that I've tried to keep similar curves across the different characters where they
    were appliable-maybe tried a bit too hard in a fee cases, as Eben picked up. :)\r\n\r\nI
    just had a look at our Rutager and Rutabon- I can see the similarity you refer
    to, though aspects of them in turn remin d me of an old creation of mine \"Cleaver's
    Juvenia\", which was derived from the face in a 19th century soap advertisment."

  body: "Hello, I like the general feel to it, also I did like your book-like specimen
    in the beginning (though it's definitely not a face for a whole novel, for one
    or two pages, even in bread it could be nice). It definitely has a 19th century
    feel to it.\r\n\r\nI disliked the m,n,u, as it was noted by Eben already. I disliked
    the original g, missing the upper part of the right stem. It looks like an old
    \"con-\" or \"-us\" abbreviature instead of a g. I preferred the original g to
    the one with the bulb ending the stroke.\r\n\r\nI really like the \"t\"! I always
    wished to design a high-t, but most of the time failed to get it to harmonise
    with the other letters, due to the top serif issue. Nice!"

    your spacing next. It is the thing that needs the most help. In type letters need
    to be designed with a mind to how they space and combine. See how the work quick
    bunches up? "

    the visual flow of the word.\r\n\r\neasy rermebdy though, I like the overall feel
    of it, I'd love to see a PDF sample of it all!"
