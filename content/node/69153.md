  >BROWNSTONE SANS PDF SPECIMEN</a></strong>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brownstone-Specimen-typhop_3948.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
  few days ago we were very happy to announce the release of <strong><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000598\">Brownstone
  Sans</a></strong> typeface. \r\n\r\nNow we are happy to introduce the <strong><a
  href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/downloads/Brownstone-Specimen.pdf\" >Brownstone PDF
  Specimen</a></strong>. Usually we like to invite young illustrators, photographers,
  typographers to collaborate on some material to preview the new designs. (e.g. <a
  href=\"http://www.veer.com/download/pdf/businesspenmanship_specimen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business
  Penmanship PDF</a>)\r\n\r\nThe Brownstone Sans is a very special specimen for us
  because it was written and photographed by Jon Parker, a good and personal friend
  who actually lives on Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\"
