  articles that you shot or other imagery and promise since they \u2018don\u2019t
  have a budget\u2019 that they will \u2018definitely\u2019 give proper credit to
  the photographer?\r\n\r\nOut of the dozen or so magazines in the last 2 years I\u2019ve
  had photographs published, the ones that don\u2019t pay often tell me that they
  will give credit, and so far only 20% have done so when the magazine is printed.\r\n\r\nAre
  they all just a bunch of merchant bankers? \r\n\r\nmagazine 'Helix' from Australia
  and the UK 'Design Week'. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merchantbankers_3721.jpg]"

  body: "both magaines said they will put my credit, I even talked to the guy in person
    who wrote the article for Design Week and said they were great and will put a
    credit in there but again no. This happens alot. They say the will but don't.
    \r\n\r\np.s..Chris, I think Viviana is my best model. She was my girlfriend in
    NYC about 1983, shots mostly were taken in 1987 and she actually lives in London
    too now and I hope to do another shoot soon. "
