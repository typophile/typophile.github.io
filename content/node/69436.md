body: I've decided to vote for the Liberal Democrats in the forthcoming British election.
  I think what finally swayed me was Brian Eno's music on their election broadcast
  - made it so epic and meaningful. Who would you vote for?

  body: You're going to vote for a party based on the music they use in their election
    broadcast? Ain't democracy grand! I guess we should be thankful that Nick Griffin
    probably isn't into Brian Eno.

  body: that's the thing. Brian Eno would never support the BNP. At least I hope he
    wouldn't, 'cos then I'd have to start looking at their policies. Forced emigration
    anyone? ;)

    them? Or simply that they''ve obtained permission to use his material? (I haven''t
    seen/heard the broadcast: if he specifically wrote for it, then OK)'

  body: That's what I wondered when I saw the broadcast. I thought it would be unlikely
    that he'd give them permission if he wasn't a supporter. So I looked it up, and
    found out he is. In fact, he's the party's youth representative. BTW the music
    is the classic 'Ending (An Ascent)' from his Apollo album.

    case serif lettering, which looks like a bit of a retreat from their modern, friendly,
    over-moisturised current image."

    German FDP in the European parliament. And the German FDP is a market-extremist
    party, the most dangerous party in Germany. The FDP wants to extend the duration
    of German nuclear power plants. I wonder, if they share the word <em>liberal</em>
    in their names only. And if not, I wonder, why they are in the same fraction as
    the German FDP."

  body: "My first post was a somewhat tongue-in-cheek comment about how easily we
    can be swayed: e.g. by a powerful piece of music or a celebrity endorsement. I
    think, since an election campaign is essentially advertising, it has quite a lot
    of relevance. Plus, I did post it in the 'anything goes' section.\r\n\r\n@Arno;
    I guess 'liberal' can be used to refer to a lot of things. Please explain what
    fraction the two parties share - is this in the EU parliament?"

    Eno Track 'Ending (An Ascent)'. I believe this track was used for the film '28
    Day Later' When the UK was ravaged by an infection. By no means am I saying the
    Lib Dem's are an infection, you could do a lot worse. Lib Dem are second, ahead
    of a void to the tories.
