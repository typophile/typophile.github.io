  body: "Super! I have to say LJUBLJANA never looked so good :-)\r\n\r\nCan't tell
    ou much about the greek or cyrillic, but I can say that the trasitions from straight
    into curve are generally not smooth enough. See your U. It starts to high, and
    needs more \"shoulder\" in the curve. Just dropping the points without moving
    the handles might work. This is a global problem.\r\n\r\nAlso global, it looks
    like you drew this as a single line is Illustrator and added a stroke. That's
    fine for a starting point, but causes problems: 1. The horizontals should be a
    little thinner everywhere. 2. tight curves are had to control like the apex of
    the A. 3. The joins have a tendency to get too dark. This is less of a problem
    at light weights, and gets worse as you get darker.\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: "Based on the fact that I live in a country with its capitol named Ljubljana
    I must say that this looks very nice. It looks like Ljubljana (the city) in the
    60's. To make it more nowadays it should be a bit stronger and less hight variable.
    Probably.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is the T because to me it gets confused with
    an F.\r\n\r\nI also don't find e, c and s as part of the same family. Especially
    s looks like it has more \"envy\" or even \"hatred\" in it and I don't think that
    goes well with other characters and especially not with Ljubljana itself.\r\n\r\nCyrillic
    is quite ok, but I think you need to work on the Greek typeface a bit more, because
    characters don't match the style of Roman and Cyrillic."

  body: "Wow, thanks for all the comments.\r\n\r\n@randy: I don't quite see what you
    mean about the U and other curves, but I'll play with the \"shoulders\" and try
    to see it. The font began as a single stroke in FontForge, so it should be easy
    to try a slight width variation.  I'm definitely not going darker, though, so
    no worries there.\r\n\r\n@cerulean & @litera: I guess I need to fix the T. :(
    My next step is to expand this into upper and lower case versions, so that shouldn't
    be a problem.\r\n\r\n@litera: That's about the biggest compliment you could give
    me on this font -- I began to see it in my head as I walked from the train station
    to a hostel in Ljubljana, with the city all around me. I began the sketches that
    night. \r\n\r\nMaybe the middle of the S is too diagonal... would it be better
    if it were flatter?  Or would the e, c, and s look more like part of the family
    if the serif was smaller?\r\n\r\nI'll post another sample once I've got something
    new to show.\r\n\r\n-matt\r\n\r\n "

  body: "The problem with your \"s\" is that it's not symmetrically open. the bottom
    is open and welcoming, the top is closed and \"to itself\". Serif definitely adds
    a lot to that.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if you would make those \"serifs\" smaller
    it would distinguish those forms from the rest and eventually you'd have to discard
    them.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying that design goes well with Ljubljana I meant the
    word \"Ljubljana\" goes well with the city. Other words and letters in them don't
    fall in the same group. I suggest you start making changes on the letters based
    on those that are in the word Ljubljana. Because those are looking pretty ok to
    me."
