  body: If you are doing PS outlines, you hit CTRL + F7 for the hinting mode, and
    it will show you the numbers (hierarchy) of the paths by first nodes. I forget
    if you can change their order or not.

  body: "Thanks JP! I know that I can rearranged the order by copying/deleting/pasting
    strategically, but before I hadn\u2019t known how to see what the numbers were.
    This will save time when I\u2019m getting ready to interpolate."

  body: "Yeah, I know there is that longwinded method of changing the outline order,
    but I had this vague memory that there was a way to select an outline and simply
    move it up or down in the hierarchy. But when I checked around in the menus it
    doesn't look like there is a way. Certainly seems like there should, though.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    happy interpolating!"

    show up. But I can't remember how. :)\r\nCheers!"

  body: James1 and James2, thanks for the tip about "set startpoints" mode. I couldn't
    remember where it was, but sure enough, what you say is true.
