  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I recently presented a client with some initial concepts which were quite well received.  However, we quickly got into the disucssion about &lsquo;appropriateness&rsquo; regarding a particular typeface.  It&rsquo;s an ultra-simple grid-based font.</p>
<p>We agreed that it would probably be more appropriate if the edges of the elements were not sharp&hellip;instead they should all be rounded.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m in a position to build a font that is clearly based upon something else, yet I&rsquo;m making some small global changes.  I don&rsquo;t even own the face in question so there is no basis for me to copy their actual work&hellip;but I  wonder if there is some etiquette regarding these kinds of things?</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>
<p>Thanks&hellip;</p>

<li>The client licenses the original foundries type properly, i.e. for the number of machines and locations as specified by the eula. 2. you customize it as the client wishes. 3. the client replaces the customized font into the same licensing &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; as the original font. 4. You don&rsquo;t license the font to anyone else unless they have the same deal as the first client, and it&rsquo;s not exclusive to that client, or you totally recreate the font from scratch, remaking all the contours, all spacing and tables as if it was new.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You say “small changes”, what does that mean? To me, the first thing is to look at the EULA.  If you don’t own the font, ask the foundry about it. If you are just doing a few words and not an actual font and the result will not be taken as the original you are probably OK. If you are making an entire font for sale competing with the original, it should be clearly enough different to not be taken as a rip off.  If it must look just like the original with a few minor changes, ask the designer to do it for you or give you permission to do it your self.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don’t even own the face in question so there is no basis for me to copy their actual work…but I wonder if there is some etiquette regarding these kinds of things?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I was trying to talk about the etiquette of showing others where the inspiration came from.  The designer in question talks about where his inspiration originated (other fonts).  Perhaps it&rsquo;s a completely stupid question&hellip;</p>
<p>So, is there some etiquette that typographers (I&rsquo;m a designer of 10 years but not a traditional typographer) use in these instances?  Are there some generic rules?</p>
<p>The new font that I will likely be creating is unique enough&hellip;will not be for sale (unless somebody wants to handle that for me - too busy)&hellip;and is only based up the inspiration of another face.</p>
<p>Perhaps Arial should have referred to Helvetica or Grotesque, but it didn&rsquo;t.  Some fonts do try to show the influence.  I&rsquo;m in new waters here&hellip;</p>

<p>if you use a grid you&rsquo;ve seen used by somebody else, but you have to rebuild it entirely from scratch (in indesign, quark or whatever), its your work, not his. would you pay this other designer because your grid derived from his? no.</p>

<p>&quot; the etiquette of showing others where the inspiration came from&quot;
I&rsquo;m lost. Etiquette, really has nothing to do with it. I think the word you&rsquo;re looking for is honesty, forthrightedness, or &ldquo;being upfront,&rdquo; about saying Y-type is based on X-type.</p>
