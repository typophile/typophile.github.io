  the main text on a page? The default spacing just seems so uneven and tight to me,
  especially the way that the f's, r's and t's bump into their neighbors.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

  body: OK, now for a serious answer/opinion. It sounds like you're spacing it out
    a bit just to help legibility. I don't see why this would be a problem. Is this
    being used as body copy?

      InDesign's optical kerning would be better."

    not only the problem characters but all of them apart).\r\n\r\nIt sounds as if
    it would make more sense to edit the kern pairs or choose a different face or
    font.\r\n\r\n\r\n--Kathleen"

  body: If it's only a few paragraphs I'd just manually kern it rather than dealing
    with kerning tables, altho those are quite useful and you might want to do it
    that way in order to have them for later uses.

    second that, unless you've got some big bold letters to do. Then you're gonna
    just have to kern the bastards. Gill Sans, at least every copy I've ever used
    has really bad letterspacing. But alas, it is a humanist face...hard to set perfect
    metrics for it. "

  body: I've been a fan of InDesign's optical kerning since inception.  Eric Gill
    didn't design it to be a giant headline face, and the electronic version doesn't
    want to do it either.  Please don't make a face do something it wasn't designed
    to do....

    look at some letterprinted samples from the Fifties (we're talking lead here!)
    and you'll instantly notice that's a lot better. Gill Sans (digital) really needs
    a lot of letterspacing (the Light, Regular, Book and their Italics surely) to
    get that suave look it had in the old days\u2026"

  body: "Walter Tracy writes that Gill sans was originally widely spaced--too widely
    in his view. It looks like from this discussion the original spacing had some
    merit in it. The attempts to get a good tighter spacing seem to have been not
    so good, according to those here who have used it. \r\n\r\nSo your instincts to
    track it wider has some historical justification."

  body: "Reviving this old thread... and transmogrifying it into my own question:\r\n\r\nDoes
    Gill Sans also typically have tight-to-none spacing after a period? I recently
    saw a document produced entirely in Gill Sans and after every period, especially
    those followed by an A, I wanted to insert a space. It seemed elsewehere the word
    spacing was more or less normal. All text was ragged right. \r\n\r\nI'm curious
    if this is a quirk with Gill Sans? I don't have the digital document to examine,
    and I will not get any formatting info from the person who created the document,
    so there's no way for me to know if it's been tracked or if the spaces have simply
    been left out. \r\n\r\nI was hoping perhaps someone here might know if this is
    a usual and known oddness with the typeface.\r\n\r\nKristina"
