body: i have a client who would like something similar to this old, monogramed linen
  napkin. are there fonts out there such as these? and if so, where? or should i hire
  a calligrapher or someone else? i don't think i'm capable of creating something
  like these. (although maybe if it's simple, with some intruction i could learn.)

  body: "Michael Clark could do it:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/user/6065\r\n\r\nI
    could too, but as I have a full-time job you might try him. Are you wanting the
    actual dotted version as well or just an inline version?"

  body: 'yes, my client would like both versions. i think he essentially wants me
    to have this copied, except using the initials of his company: ''PE''. i have
    contacted a local (bay area) calligrapher....but am not sure yet if she''s able
    to do it.'
