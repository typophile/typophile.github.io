    does seem to work the best. aaux isn''t as bad as i thought it would be, but it
    is too big and i think needs a little more letterspace. '

    way- is that the TBS font. Amazing how a font can look so much like VAG (which
    I hate) and look so cutting edge. Mmmmm."

  body: Could you provide some background on the marketing about the company. Who
    is the audience? What does the company want to accomplish.

  body: I have updated the logo on the first post with newly purchased Bryant font.
    I put an alternative using dots between the words.

  body: Very nice logo indeed. timd's point is well taken; nevertheless I prefer the
    first effort (the one with the pseudo dot notation) because it separates the three
    parts of the name, making the name as a whole easier to assimilate/understand/remember.
    After all, sad though it may be, most non-designers don't spend a lot of time
    gazing at a mark. Read quickly, even with the color alternation, the company name
    is a bit of a blur. So I would say that the dots serve to make the mark "stickier"
    for most people while also being a bit of a nod to any networking geeks who happen
    to be passing by.

  body: Very nice mark/icon. The type, to me, is just sitting there. It seems like
    it needs a little extra something, without competing with the mark. What that
    is, I'm not sure.

    website to appear if they type "computer.pro.rescue" into their web browsers.
