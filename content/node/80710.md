  by associating \r\nsome words with it and typing them in different styles of Bodoni.\r\n\r\nA
  draft of what the first poster will look like. Containing all the words.\r\nThen
  I'll dedicate one poster to each word visualizing the word in a real environment.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think about it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Postertypophile_4088.jpg]"

  body: "I think the words look cool. My two cents: I reckon the braces are too big
    and the extrusion of the Bodoni is too deep. Also, maybe try a shallower 3D perspective
    so the Bodoni is less distorted...\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: I think you'd better not use the extrude effect, as it looks rather cheap
    IMHO. I also don't think it fits the spirit of Bodoni. I like the heart though.
    The braces could do without the gradient. I would try to make it simpler yet more
    graceful. The words themselves and the treatment is nice, but perhaps the overall
    arrangement and the colour needs more work.

  body: "Reading more closely, I have to say I find some words not fitting with Bodoni
    (Robust, Hardworking). I think the new arrangement is blander than the one before,
    as it all becomes very boxy and symmetrical. If this is a print poster I would
    probably ditch the gradient, as it looks nice on screen but often cheap on paper
    (especially shiny paper).\r\n\r\nI would definately try some different colours,
    and ditch the green... Concentrate on the arrangement in black and white first,
    then see which colour would fit. Personally I would go for a more classical colour
    scheme (white, red, black, perhaps some silvery grey), more fitting with the work
    of Gianbattista Bodoni, but try to find a way to give it a contempory touch, for
    instance by working on a nice type arrangement."

    red, black). If you can, get to a Taschen store and look at their gorgeous reproduction
    of Bodoni's [[http://www.amazon.com/Bodoni-Typography-Dr-Stephan-Fussel/dp/3836505533/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1301675678&sr=8-1|Typographic

    or \"Timeless.\""

    it will be in print. Will try to look for the manual. Though I have managed to
    get my hands on a prehistoric edition of Manuale tipografico del cavaliere. :)\r\n "

    more than Robust, Versatile and Hardworking.
