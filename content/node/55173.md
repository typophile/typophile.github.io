    #714409, which is equivalent to Avery #5660/8660. They''re clear and laser-compatible.
    I''ve never tried them on an inkjet, but the package says they''re inkjet compatible.
    These are 1" x 2-5/8" address labels, but they probably come in other sizes too.'

    Just be SURE you only use stickers designed for laser printing in a laser, and
    stickers designed for inkjet printing in an inkjet.\r\n\r\nUsing the wrong stickers
    in a laser printer could result in the stickers melting inside your printer, potentially
    destroying the printer or causing a costly repair bill. Using the wrong stickers
    in an inkjet probably won't hurt anything, but the ink might wipe off or smear,
    leaving you with some expensive but useless stickers.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT "
