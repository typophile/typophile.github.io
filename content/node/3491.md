body: Hi Guys, <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for any help/advice given. <BR> <BR>I am
  designing a Photo Album for the Past President of CPA Australia &#40;the largest
  business organisation in the southern hemisphere with well over 100,000 members&#41;.
  It is to commemorate his year as president and include photos of his journeys and
  attendances at conferences in Australia and Asia. <BR> <BR>He loves sailing and
  my concept is to use Maps of Australia and Asia to made to look a little antique.
  <BR> <BR>Any idea of fonts that might suit this purpose &#40;or any ideas for where
  I might find examples of cool old maps?&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks again!

    like you might see on old maps. It has three optical sizes, too.

  body: Daniel, <BR> <BR>Up yer scuppers with the &#34;fake antique&#34; offense,
    avoid anchors at all cost. Done to death.  <BR> <BR>Since this is a &#34;one off&#34;
    it is well suited for letterpress. A &#34;one off &#34; on a Vandercook can give
    you superior results without inhaling reams of paper. <BR> <BR>I recommend fine
    hand made paper, or a pedigree watercolor stock. Good laundry is always important.
    Something acid free. Remember
