    to install the sprinkler valves sticking up friggin' <em>two feet</em> off the
    ground, lawyers had something to do with that too... There's a very good reason
    why bashing lawyers doesn't go out of fashion. On the other hand, although (most)
    lawyers are in effect ambulance-chasers, the problem goes much deeper than a single
    career choice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: If you are referring to curve direction, if they were all the same direction
    the counters wouldn't work.  They would be there but they would be solid like
    the rest of the letter and thus, invisible.

    by Postscript and TrueType; here is something relevant from the fontforge documentation
    http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/editexample2.html#non-zero\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nBoth
    PostScript and TrueType require that the outer boundary of a glyph be drawn in
    a certain direction (they happen to be opposite from each other, which is a mild
    annoyance)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI was not aware of that difference."

  body: "@Ryan - re: How FontLab displays nested contours -\r\n\r\nThat's a function
    of how the rendering agent interprets the curves.  Same is true of any other font
    print or display.  All you have are a lot of bits in a file - to get them to look
    like something, there's a program that interprets what the bits mean. Different
    programs can interpret differently and give different results. And they do.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Ryan, does the same happen when the outside and inside counters <em>both</em>
    run in the opposite direction? And when they run in the <em>same</em> direction?
    I.e., is FontLab aware you are \"drawing\" a TrueType font or a Type 1 font, the
    moment you draw a closed object?\r\n\r\nIf the clockwise/counterclockwise rule
    is enforced, then a single counterclockwise object logically would show nothing
    in one font type and something in the other (I can't be bothered to look up \u2013
    literally \u2013 which one does what ;)). Does it really work that way?"

  body: TdJ - Fontlab doesn't know whether you're going to generate a TT or T1 font;
    it will set the contour directions as you instruct it, and will render the glyphs
    properly regardless. So if you draw a circle, it will appear solid regardless
    of its direction. If you draw two circles and drag so they overlap  (like a Venn
    diagram) the overlap will be black if the two circles are in the same direction
    and white if they're opposite. Doesn't matter if they're defined as PS or TT direction
    (Fontlab's terminology).

    auto PS/TT path direction tools if you have made a glyph in which a bounded white
    space is intersected by a line and you have not yet merged the paths. So, for
    example, if you have made a Cyrillic \u04E8 and the bar is not yet merged with
    the O shape the auto path direction tools will tend to get confused and you end
    up with this sort of thing:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BarredOops_6393.jpg]\r\n______\r\n\r\nAs
    to why the PS and TT formats use opposite path direction rules, I reckon when
    Apple developed TT they simply set out to do as many things differently from Adobe
    as possible. Hence quadratic rather than cubic beziers, and hence the different
    path directions. I don't know if actual lawyers were involved, or if Sampo and
    his colleagues simply decided to play it safe."
