  I'm an IT guy with a recent growing interest in good typography so please excuse
  my newbie questions.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n\r\n- Is there a reliable tool (on Windows) to
  check the number of kerning pairs in fonts? I installed 'Font properties extension
  2.30' from Microsoft but for lots of .otf fonts it says 'no kerning pairs' available
  and when I look in the fonts with Typograf 4.8f I see xxx numbers of kerning pair!
  For some fonts, the MS tool and Typograf have different kerning pairs numbers...
  Who's right on this?\r\n\r\n-  Is there a way to check for fonts 'originality'?
  The other day, I had a question from a new employee replacing one of our designer.
  She had a problem working in InDesign with a particular font (don't remember which
  one) saying that the default kerning was not what she expected (she said she knows
  that font really well...). I have checked the .otf file and it seems original to
  me but she said that maybe the previous designer made modifications on it or converted
  it from a PS font. How can I verify this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nF"

    may help me verify the originality of the fonts..."

  body: "1. If the font contains class kerning, you probably need an application like
    FontLab, if you want to see, how many kerning pairs the font includes. But the
    number of kerning pairs does not say anything about the quality of the spacing,
    because the pairs may be wrong or they correct wrong plain metrics or they are
    simply (almost) never used (kerning between small capitals and regular small letters
    for example).\r\n\r\n2. For me the use of unlicensed fonts is okay, if you don\u2019t
    earn money with them in any way, neither with selling them nor with using them
    in a project, for which you get money. If you license a font, you will get the
    original and there is no need to check a font for authenticity. It is a bit boldfaced
    to ask your question on Typophile. I mean, what you want to have, is support for
    piracy from the developers of fonts."

  body: "Arno, the second question wasn't anything to do with \u2018use of unlicensed
    fonts\u2019, it was about checking whether a font has been modified. Plenty of
    licenses permit modifying fonts so long as the derivative versions are not distributed.\r\n\r\nThere's
    no easy way to check whether a font has been modified without having the original
    against which to do a diff.\r\n____\r\n\r\nRe. the kerning question: there are
    two kinds of kerning that a font may have: kern table pair kerning, and GPOS table
    kerning (which may involve classes or, indeed, even funky things like contextual
    kerning, or kerning implemented as single glyph adjustments instead of pairs).
    When you examine a font using the MS Font Properties Extension, the 'Features'
    tab will indicate how many \u2018standard kern pairs\u2019 a font contains; this
    is the number of kern pairs in the kern table. If a font is not reported as having
    any standard kern pairs, this does not mean that it has no kerning: it may have
    GPOS kerning (check the OpenType Layout feature tree in the same tab).\r\n\r\nFont
    editing or examining tools do different things when looking at fonts with GPOS
    kerning. Some will parse the GPOS kern feature and report the information back
    in terms of pairs, but there are various ways in which this can be misleading.
    For instance, a tool may or may not expand class kerning, and since GPOS kerning,
    like all OTL features, may be script and language specific what data is actually
    being looked at?\r\n\r\nAs noted in the Calibri kerning thread, tools also do
    different things when looking at kern table kerning. The MS font properties extension
    and DTL OTMaster will give you accurate pair counts (as will Ascender's FontChef
    tool). Other tools, including TTX, may not, depending on the size of the table.\r\n\r\nNote,
    however, that the number of pairs in the kern table and even a list of those pairs
    won't necessarily reflect the actual kerning that you're going to get in different
    applications. Some applications can't handle very large numbers of kern pairs,
    and some have weird bugs based on things like 8-bit codepage contents (e.g. MS
    Word kerning only monotonic Greek diacritics, not polytonic)."

  body: "\r\nThanks for your answer Arno but I think you misunderstood my questions,
    maybe my poor english...\r\n\r\n1. I know that the number of kerning pairs does
    not say anything about the quality of the spacing. It's a really subjective matter
    for what I know. I'm just looking for some nice tools because I'm a geek and I
    was surprised to see different numbers with the two applications mentionned. The
    problem seems indeed related to class kerning so thanks for that. i will read
    some papers about that and will investigate.\r\n\r\n2. I suppose my question was
    poorly asked but let me say that I DO NOT support fonts/software piracy. On the
    contrary, my job as IT specialist is to make sure that we only work with licensed
    software (and that can be a pain for intranet applications...)!\r\nIn fact, I
    wanted to know if it was possible that the font may have been modified by the
    previous designer, maybe with a program like Fontlab or whatever, and if it was
    possible to check that in the font properties. I'm not used to that kind of technical
    details coming from a database and network engineer background. I guess I'll re-install
    everything from scratch on her computer and will see what happens.\r\n\r\nThanks
    anyway,\r\nF"

    the fonts? Then you have access to the originals? Somehow I don\u2019t get it.
    Checking, whether anything was changed in a font, is much more complicated than
    reinstalling the original. If you want to ensure, that everything is licensed
    on a computer, (formatting the harddisk and) reinstalling everything (that is
    licensed) is much easier than checking everything. In case of fonts there is not
    much to install. Naturally, if you use a font manager with a data base, it might
    be more complicated, but I would prefer to organize the fonts by myself as designer.
    And the same is true for the other software. I would like to have a fresh computer
    with regard to the installed software. (I even would not like it, if anybody else
    than me installs anything on the computer.)"

    not what he's trying to do, Arno. He never mentioned licensing in his questions
    and his explanation make quite clear what he is actually trying to check: whether
    the kerning in a particular font has been modified or is as provided by the foundry."

  body: "Arno,\r\n\r\nIn my company, we manage about 12000 workstations so we have
    some automated process to install most of the software (not the fonts and some
    specialized apps like CAD/Publishing) but I won't get into details. I have more
    than 15 years of IT experience so I know a little about computers and whenever
    I get the chance to learn new technical stuff I'm happy. I never had this kind
    of problems before (we only have a few people working with CAD and Publishing
    software) so it was a good opportunity to ask the question here and get enlightened
    but of course the easier for me is to send one of our technician re-install everything.
    We keep track of all software installed on a user computer so everything will
    be fine next week, and yes, we have access to all originals but fonts CD's are
    stored on a remote site and are not accessible trough the network so I could'nt
    make a checksum to compare with the original... So if I was able to check rapidly
    the originality of the font, I would not have to send a technician get the CD
    to the remote site, re-install, and bring the CD back. Sometimes simple things
    may be really complicated in a big organization!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nF"

  body: "Fontology,\r\n\r\nA first thing to check to see if a font has been modified
    or not, is to check its version number against an original. On Mac OSX, this is
    as simple as Get Info -- for Windows, you need Microsoft's own Font Properties
    extension.\r\n\r\nIf the version number is different, that is almost certainly
    the reason. If the version number is the same but the modification date/time and
    file size is different, the font <em>might</em> have been edited -- most foundries
    are careful to maintain accurate version numbering, precisely for this reason."

    and unmodified, then check to see whether InDesign\u2019s Optical Metrics feature
    has been applied.\r\n\r\nThis feature very subtly, but very definitely, mucks
    up the spacing of a font \u2014 ignoring and overriding the font\u2019s metrics
    and kerning.\r\n\r\nI just had a conversation with a colleague about a circumstance
    where the first proofs of a magazine redesign using a custom typeface design,

    atrocious, and my friend thought he was going crazy and began to question everything
    he thought he knew about spacing and H&Js. \r\n\r\nIt turns out someone had ignorantly
    applied Optical Metrics. Upon turning this off and reproofing, everyone agreed

  body: "@Theunis\r\n\r\nThat was my first idea but I'm not sure if it's really accurate.
    Also, in the case mentionned above, I didn't have the original to compare.\r\n\r\nOn
    windows, if you double-click on a font, calibri.ttf by example, it opens a simple
    preview of that font and it gives you different info like 'File Size', 'Typeface
    Name' and 'Version' (oh, and it also activates it by the way!). I have tested
    some random fonts and compared the results with the info given by the MS Font
    Properties Extension 2.30. Some fonts (not too sure but I think it was a Calibri
    font installed with the PowerPoint2007 preview software on Windows XP) had a different
    version number in the two apps, like Version 5.00 on the preview app and 1.0x
    on the other, aargh!\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if I would trust the version number.
    What if someone opens the font with an editor, modify some kerning pairs and saves
    it? I guess it does not change the version number unless you specify it but I
    have no experience with those tools.\r\n\r\n@Kent\r\n\r\nExcellent tip! I have
    only little experience with InDesign so i forgot about that feature (never tried
    it). I'll check that monday morning before asking to re-install everything."

    Indesign and the myfonts font preview with regard to the kerning of the pair.
    Myfonts (on the <strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/oldsite\">the old site</a></strong>
    is a check box, that activates the kerning) displays the kerning at least partly.\r\n\r\nAnd
    you can post the name of the font style and the kerning value here. Indesign displays
    the value. There is probably someone here, that has access to the font.\r\n\r\nThe
