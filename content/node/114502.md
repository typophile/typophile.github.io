    may also be lettering. But I did spot a font with similar flare like projections
    from L and T. This is LHF Conclave by Chuck Davis http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-conclave/\r\nFor
    various fonts in the Victorian ornamented genre there are several foundries with
    some interesting designs.\r\nDecade Type Foundry http://decadetypefoundry.bigcartel.com/\r\nFont
    Mesa http://www.myfonts.com/search/font+mesa/fonts/\r\nHiH http://www.myfonts.com/search/hih/fonts/\r\nGreater
    Albion http://www.myfonts.com/search/Greater+albion/fonts/\r\nSolotype http://www.myfonts.com/search/solotype/fonts/\r\nIntellecta
    http://www.myfonts.com/search/intellecta/fonts/\r\nLHF Letterhead http://www.letterheadfonts.com/\r\nMyfonts
    has several tags that are worth exploring, including \"Wild West\", western, circus,
    country, rodeo, and 1800s.\r\nIn addition you could check the Western Theme at
    Dafont http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=106&text=GUNSMOKEBUYSELLTRADE&fpp=100
    Most of these are amateur efforts or free fonts by reputable authors. But be careful
    on use, because some are rips of the work of others.\r\n\r\nDon"
