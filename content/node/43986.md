  body: "The ST should connect at the top. \r\n\r\nLose the double-wide bowl of the
    last R and the extra curve at the far right connecting the YEAR and ROOSTER. Decrease
    the angle  of the yellow enough so that you can see a little white inside the
    A and R at the end -- the 3-dimensional nature is getting lost over there.  \r\n\r\nOther
    than that, it's very cool.  Very 1970s disco, good choice of colors and good letterforms."
