  and ranting about a specific designer and foundry is not what I'm up to...]\r\n\r\nNow
  I know that badly spaced/kerned font aren't hard to come by. What makes this case
  special, though: the foundry, in its press release that's reproduced by retailers,
  emphasizes the \u203Alove\u2039 that the designer put into spacing and kerning.
  At first sight it seems some of that love simply missed a few kerning pairs. But
  even the most fundamental pairs (<code>Te</code> etc.) don't seem to be kerned either.\r\n\r\nLooking
  at the font file itself, it turns out that the font doesn't contain any kerning
  information *at all* (nor does it contain any other OpenType features, but unlike
  the kerning, I wasn't promised anything along that lines anyway).\r\n\r\nWas I too
  naive thinking that the terminology of such blurbs wouldn't be flexible enough to
  include the absence of any any kerning even when it advertises the font as particularly
  well kerned? Should I consider it a bug, contact the retailer (or foundry?), \xBBI
  think the kerning information got lost along the way... could you provide me with
  new files that include it?\xAB As for a refund? etc. What do you think?\r\n\r\nany
  ideas appreciated!\r\n-- Nils"

    licensed a font the other day, a recently released family of 10 weights * 2 styles
    * text + display version. I was a bit suspicious of the whole thing, as there
    didn't seem to be a PDF specimen available anywhere. But the introductory offer
    was a nice one, and the font seemed perfect for my purposes.\r\n\r\nWhat I got
    was a font that, as expected, does have its qualities in some respects, but is
    kerned/spaced so horribly that it's pretty much useless for the application it
    was designed for -- it's meant to be a \u203Alegible\u2039 sans for body text.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, in a string like <code>Hertz/Watt</code>, the lower end of the slash
    overlaps with the <code>z</code>, and its upper end overlaps with the <code>W.</code>
    In a word like <code>pad</code>, the <code>a</code> is considerably closer to
    the <code>p</code> than it is to the <code>d</code> ...etc. All these things a
    clearly visible at regular reading sizes."

      Yes, I do know some of the best fonts come with no kerning at all because they're
      <em>spaced</em> so well. This is not the case here. What I think is the case
      is either (a) a font that would need kerning info, and was produced with it,
      but, due to some accident, doesn't come with it -- or (b) a considerable discrepancy
      between what the foundry vs. myself consider a \xBBlovingly spaced and kerned\xAB
      font."

      had accidentally used optical kerning instead, the results would look better
      (yes, it's that bad). As I mentioned, there is no OT <code>kern</code> feature
      (or kerning table) in the font at all, so, in this particular font, an optically
      kerned <code>Te</code> is an improvement over the default.\r\n\r\nTried ID and
      LuaLaTeX for typesetting (same problems); otfinfo and Fontlab for looking at
      the files themselves.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6pSGPzY.png\"/>"

  body: it's solved now. I contacted the foundry=designer last night, and got a very
    nice reply within a few hours. They were aware of the problem, and had already
    provided MyFonts with replacement files, but apparently MyFonts hasn't updated
    the files on their server yet. One e-mail later, the foundry provided me with
    the replacement files directly. Great customer service; I'm impressed.
