  effort to use a modified version in a Corporate ID.  \r\n\r\nSo far, I've been looking
  at kerning pairs, quote marks, parentheses, ampersand, etc etc in FontLab, and I
  would love to have proper numerals but I don't quite presume to be able to draw
  up my own at this point\u2014especially given that they will see heavy use in text
  applications. \r\n\r\nBut I wouldn't mind playing with the size and placement of
  existing numerals, which I have enough time and confidence to attempt.\r\n\r\nThought
  Typophiles might find this interesting - - any suggestions? "

    my client to as well, but it is my understanding that as long as they own the
    license to Helvetica, they can use our mod. I am not selling them a font, nor
    am I representing it as my work, I am rendering the service of modifying its functions
    AS Helvetica, which is tantamount to adjusting kerning, baseline-shifting, letterspacing
    and using it along with other fonts, in the case of switched ampersand, numerals
    and other characters. This would be  what we are getting payed to do as relates
    to that font. "

    numerals has me convinced that their starting point is the same as my own proof-of-concept
    : i.e. they've shifted most numerals up or down, used the <em>lc</em> \u2018o'
    as the zero, shortened the 1 and winged a 2.. \r\n\r\nI will have to take a look
    at its behavior, because the snags I ran into upon investigating my own 'faked'
    versions is that there is no end of trouble arising from the 1,2, 3 & 7 in terms
    of their tone in a body of text and 'visual' x-height\u2014especially apparent
    at smaller sizes. I see their 2 is dramatically different. It's either that they
    compressed the 2 or that they know something I don't. I'll take a look - thanks;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaOldStyle_5319.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW
    : I wouldn't want to discourage other suggestions. The idea that there will be
    numerals that ARE Helvetica is not necessarily the end-goal here... Otherwise,
    I'd be fighting that battle and not be asking typophile.. It would be valid just
    to arrive at a selection of numerals that function in the same way as an italic,
    or a different language, might inside latin text..\r\n\r\nThanks again Riccard0\r\n"

    if you want to pursue this direction, I would definately not take the lower case
    \"o\" as zero. Rather I would use a perfect circle to make it clearly distinctive.
    BTW, for another example of gothic with oldstyle figures look at ITC Franklin
    Gothic book condensed. \r\n\r\nBut why not go for another alternative. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bell/|Bell]]
    uses numerals that are \xB175% the height of the caps, therefore making them stick
    out a lot less. It is a rather easy modification to make, and I think it works

    I hear you... To assuage some of the skepticism a bit further ( and save some
    face, lol ) let me explain that the thinking behind this has been to co-opt the,
    yes, commercial, \u2018inclusive' qualities Helvetica can imbue, yet arrive at
    a singular and unmistakable application of it. There is an element of fun and
    irreverence intended, which is central to the brand being developed : a fashion
    house\u2019s lower-cost product line. \r\n\r\nAs I said, the Helvetica mandate
    comes straight from the client, but not out of a place of ignorance : the very
    idea is taking generic, base elements which may not be \u2018ideally suited for
    the job' and elevating them through decisions made in their use and juxtapositions.
    A certain level of garishness will ensue if all goes to plan, which will hopefully
    be part of the charm. That said, we also need good function and so I find great
    value in a lot of the information here - - the French scheme and Bell scale are

    in a monoline font your options are limited. This is actually another reason to
    go with hybrids*, instead of OS nums that fit within the x-height.\r\n\r\n* Like

    after the first moment of surprise. By using that quite unusual scheme of numerals
    you're introducing a second level of typographic sophistication, if you will,
