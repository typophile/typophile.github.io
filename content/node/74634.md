  be like when hyphenating a word in bold, italics &c.? Should it be bold/\u2026 too?
  (I assume it's a single word in bold/\u2026 within an entire paragraph in a regular
  face.)\r\n\r\nIf there is no standard, what would you say the common practice is?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :)"

  body: Well, as for standards go, automatic hyphenation will use the glyph from the
    weight/style in which the word is set.

  body: "Right, I guess I haven't worded myself clearly enough, sorry.\r\n\r\nI'll
    put it another way: do you think that it's OK that automatic hyphenation (in TeX)
    uses the same weight/style for hyphen as the hyphenated word is, even if the entire
    paragraph is set in a different weight/style?\r\n\r\nIf you think it should rather
    use the weight/style of the paragraph, do you perhaps have any idea how to change
    it?"

    the hyphen in a bold or italic word were in roman style.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Actually, I realized the issue even exists when I saw three hyphenated lines
    in a row and the middle hyphen was very visibly thicker than the surrounding ones.\r\nI
    guess it was an issue with the particular font, then, not with the mechanism?\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the answers!"
