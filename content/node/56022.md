  Venezky is one of the many graphic designers who leave me awe inspired...I cannot
  <strong>WAIT</strong> for his lecture!!!\r\nI chose this particular piece for its
  distinctive collage look. This piece is in celebration of his solo exhibition in
  San Francisco. Martin cut out and placed every piece of this poster by hand. Just
  brilliant! What a refreshing look at collaging!"

  body: This is really quite an amazing collage. I was wondering though.. can an equal
    amount of mileage be achieved if we were to use any colour other than yellow here?
    If so which colour? (It's a genuine question; not a rhetorical comment!!!)

  body: Well, I can't speak for Martin, but I do believe that the monochromatic [yellow,
    blk, wht] did make it a tad easier on him. I don't know if another color would/should
    be added...what did you have in mind?
