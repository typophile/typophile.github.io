  body: "I suspect this is a sort of ornate \"Ransom Note\"-style job, with each letter
    coming from a different fancy antique typeface. I tried looking for some of the
    initial fonts, but was having no luck matching other letters from \"PARIS\". I
    think I've seen some of these before, but I don't have my books here, and I am
    not finding the right collections online.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
