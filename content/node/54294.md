  with typefaces and wondered if anyone can help me figure out what this fat font
  is (or perhaps something similar to it).  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fat_font_3597.jpg]

    fonts. This one(because I''ve tried to replicate this too), by my guess is it''s
    Futura at the core coupled with 20pt outline(if I remember correctly). '

  body: 'Wow.  You''re right. If I give Futura a huge stroke, I get something similar.
    In my further exploration of fat faces, do you have any recommendations? I''ve
    been playing around with Fulton but am looking for something a little different.
    Any thoughts would be much appreciated. '

    to take a geometric slab serif (Rockwell, Memphis, Lubalin Graph) and stroke the
    heck out of it.

  body: LOL..it's true! Poke around Non-Format's website to see what else they do.
    If you really want this..I can send you my (crappy) Illustrator file. I think
    I made all the letters..but gave up after that. It's also really hard to set nicely.
