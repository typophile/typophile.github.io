body: Does anyone know what font is used for the amazon.com logo.  I've read that
  it is Officina Sans Bold & Roman, but the top of the lowercase "a" curves and slopes
  a little more than Officina Sans, same for lowercase "c."  Also, the stems for lowercase
  m and n are curved a little in Officina Sans while they are squared off in the Amazon.com
  logo.  Any ideas?

    as you allude, with Helvetica Condensed closest to the ".com".
