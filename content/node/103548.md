  Norwich, England.\r\n\r\nI printed with a wood letter typeface, called 'Sans Bold
  \"34\". I've created a logo out of this font, and now want to use it for the rest
  of the identity. Is anyone familiar with this typeface, and could you recommend
  a computerised version?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHarry Hepburn[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wood-Letter-for-forum_6089.png]"

    than your specimen.\r\nHere's one based on 1898 woodtype where BMARE more or less
    match your image letterforms but at a lighter weight: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/cheap-pine/\">Cheap

    know, some people are recreating actual woodtype. Here's one that is close <a

    (hand traced from the prints). \r\n\r\nPersonally, if you want to stick with the
    aesthetic, I'd see if you can get the full alphabet re-printed and use the actual
    bitmap scans if you can. "

  body: "I agree with aluminum that to get an exact match it would be best to work
    direct from your own images rather than trying to find a font that precisely matches
    \"Sans Bold 34.\"  Each wood type foundry used its own numbering system, so a
    similar font from another foundry might be sold as Gothic 55 or Grotesk 101. Also
    some foundries used different names/numbers for different font sizes.\r\nIf I
    recall correctly, wood type foundries did not have the equivalent of the electrotyping
    process used by metal type foundries to precisely copy the typefaces of competitors.
    So exact copies of wood type would have been labor intensive and would cut into
    profits.\r\nThe only way you might be assured of an exact match is if the digital
    font designer  cites your foundry. I note that your source is at a museum in the
    UK, so I presume that this is a British foundry.\r\nHowever, you might be in luck.
    The Mecanorma font <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/british-inserat/\">British
    Inserat</a> is based on a British source and looks close for the letters BMAREK
    shown in your sample. Note that R lacks the the kick at the end of the leg.\r\nGood
    luck with your project.\r\nDon"
