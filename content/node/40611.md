  body: That *may* be a freeware, rip-off of a commercial font. I don't have time
    to check, but looks a lot like Compacta.

    was an old metal type ages ago.\r\n\r\nEdit: I don't think that Haettenschweiler
    was bundled with Windows, per se. It <em>was</em> bundled with <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=30&FNAME=Haettenschweiler&FVER=2.30\"
    target=\"_blank\">lots of MS products</a>, though."
