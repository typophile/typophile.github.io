  and are unsure of the correct form of certain letters. For example these: \r\nafii10089,
  uni04BA and uni04BB. (See attached screenshot).\r\nAre these characters basic form
  'just' a lower version of the small-h, or should they be more round in shape? \r\nThanks
  for your kind assistance in this issue!"
