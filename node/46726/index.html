  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,
I&rsquo;m typesetting my first book, and after a month of looking through books, found one set in a typeface that looked fantastic, and it was id&rsquo;d as Bookman in the id forum. I believe it is Bookman oldstyle.</p>
<p>The book is a collecton of short horror stories, trade paperback. I&rsquo;ve searched through suggestions for book fonts, but bookman old style is not on any of those list. Is there any drawbacks to using this font, or any reason it shouldn&rsquo;t be used? I&rsquo;ve only seen it used in the one book. I really seem to be attracted to thicker, chunkier fonts for long passages of text. Any other suggestions if this isnt a good one to use?</p>
<p>I printed out a few pages, 10pt seemed too small and 11pt too big. 10.5 looked just right. Is it okay to use half sizes?</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d like a typeface suggestion for the story title pages that would compliment well. Probably somewhat condensed as some of the titles are long. I was thinking Bodoni condensed, but seems I&rsquo;m always using that.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions!</p>

<p>Well, my two-cents-worth would be:</p>
<p>(a) If 10.5pt looks right, go with it. Nothing wrong with half sizes.
(b) Not sure that a Bodoni is gonna go well for the title pages: I&rsquo;d have thought a low-contrast sans-serif, something with shortish ascenders/descenders will match Bookman OS better&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the pros will have something more specific to suggest. :-D</p>

<p>So, any specific suggestions for the titles? I&rsquo;ve looked through several short story collections, but nothing has really struck me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little lost, since this is rather new to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I say if half point looks good, then go for it. The problem with clunky fonts on large amounts of text is it becomes a little hard to read after a while, it&rsquo;s almost like a workout. If you give enough space in between the lines maybe it will work better. Try checking out Baskerville.It&rsquo;s still sort of thick but a well known good reader font.</p>
<p>As for titles&hellip;I&rsquo;m partial to trade gothic or franklin gothic. They both have condensed versions and contrast well to the serif text fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Bodoni would work with Bookman at all. I must confess to finding Bookman a little dated but what&rsquo;s old always becomes new again. It is fine to use half sizes, I do it all the time.</p>
<p>For your headers, why not something more fun given it&rsquo;s a horror book? House Industries Monster fonts is one way to go, or something spiky and gothic. If you don&rsquo;t want to go campy with it, I agree that a sans serif is a better idea than trying to find another serif that works with Bookman.</p>
