  me this what the name of this font is?\r\n\r\nI tried every website, like [Whatthefont]
  and others.\r\n\r\nif anybody else needs any other reference, I found out that the
  [rage usa] website uses this for their title logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n-YWK"

  body: "you can find it as <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/3ip/treefrog/|Treefrog]]</strong>
    by  Brian Willson (Three Islands Press, 1994)\r\nbut I think is actually digitized
    by Dan X. Solo as <strong>Threadneedle</strong> which is very similar but not
    an exact match.\r\n\r\nIt is also available under at least 4 other different names
    by well known font forgery companies, which I'd rather not mention.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"
