body: "Am doing a quick university project where I was looking at opposites, from
  collected responses about impressions. With these responses I am looking to create
  a set of posters stating for example -\r\n\r\nI, Joe Bloggs am\r\n[Opposite 1] -
  Font 1\r\nbut also am\r\n[Opposite 2] - Font 2\r\naccording to survey #22 and #34.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  will be using a simple type for most of the poster, but want to find some type that
  best represents the opposite words. The opposites that I have are -\r\n\r\nGeek
  / Chav\r\n\r\nIntrovert / Extrovert\r\n\r\nSkinny / Fat\r\n\r\nShort / Tall\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas for fonts thats I could use for all these opposites. Be good to have fonts
  that are completely opposite, but still look together. But am open to all suggestions!\r\n\r\nWill
  post up the finished pieces as soon as they are done :) \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and Ultra Black weights, and Ultra Compressed and Extra Wide styles.\r\nOne that
    comes to mind, still unreleased is Dezcom's Dez Squeeze.\r\nOr Storm's Moyenage:

    was the goal of the assignment, not to have you come to a forum and ask us for
    suggestions.\r\n\r\nDoing it yourself, you will learn something."

  body: "Systematically answering this when one asks a question is not going to give
    any credibility to this forum. \"I know it but I won't tell you because you have
    to work yourself\"... Great. In my mind, part of an assignment is to ask for help
    to professionals, as well.\r\n\r\nSo, right off the top of my head:\r\n\r\nGeek
    / Chav : i don't know one exactly, but for the 'geek' you should play with the
    numbers & letters like \"G33K\". / any graffiti type from Dafont.\r\n\r\nIntrovert
    / Extrovert : Mrs Eaves / Latino Samba\r\n\r\nSkinny / Fat : Knockout 26 / Knockout
    94\r\n\r\nShort / Tall : Wide Latin / Univers 39\r\n\r\n... just some basic ideas,
    there is surely some much better alternatives.\r\n"

    you have mentioned. Its not an actual assignment that we are being marked on,
    is just a bit of fun - so thats why I thought it would be ok to ask for a bit
    of help from people who know a hell of a lot more about type than me! \r\n\r\nKeep
    the replies coming please :)"
