  body: "From the FAQ:\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_15\">What
    about scripts that resemble casual handwriting?</a></strong>\r\nOoh, that\u2019s
    a tough one. You see, these are very easy and quite cheap to make, so there are
    a gazillion different handwritten fonts out there. So unless it\u2019s one of
    the better known handwritten fonts, the chances that we identify yours are quite
    slim. On the other hand, if you look around you\u2019ll most probably find an
    alternative that matches really closely."

  body: "Yves, you beat me to it. I did search the hand printed fonts in the Script
    Guide, and I went through the Handwritten category at Dafont, but this exact lettering
    was not in either place. There are a load of free handwritten fonts at [[http://www.fontgarden.com/archive.php|Font
    Garden]]. You could possibly find this one there, but as the FAQ suggests, you
    will probably find many similar alternatives with much less effort.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Ok, thanks a lots for your answer.\r\nI find some alternative very close
    in some web site, but each time there are some differents that make me impossible
    to mix the 2 scripts.\r\nThanks again for your answer."

  body: "I think if you slant the font [[http://www.fontgarden.com/gallery/a.html|FG
    Amyie]] you may find it is close enough to use with the above lettering. Otherwise,
    why not replace it all, instead of just adding to the existing words?\r\n\r\n-

  body: In fact we already have a existing paper with his script (done by a company),
    and we want to add an other paper (with map...). We'd like to have the same script,
    but the company doesn't want to tell us the name of the script...

  body: "This is the kind of font anyone can make, so maybe they made it themselves.
    There are some sites that will make a font for about $10 if you print out each
    letter in a template.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
