  body: I actually did buy it, but the website apparently uses an online reader, so
    downloading the PDF isn't an option. I agree, it's a very schizofrenic typeface,
    but I really need it for a school assignment. Anyone else have any suggestions?
    I'm desperate.

  body: After looking through your suggestions again, I think Hurme may be close enough
    to pass. Thank you!

  body: "Can't find a match. It's close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]]
    with main differences on /G and /M. Also, could be my eyes but a bit confused
    by the kerning on 'CHROMEO' which looks kind of weird/amateurish/absent (which
    could be the earmark of a freebie). Letter width looks also unconsistent, /H and
    /M looking weird among the others... A way to answer could be to [[http://pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?titleid=2086&title=Be+Street|buy
    last issue]] and inspect PDF type properties...\r\nSome alternatives: [[http://www.europatype.com/articledetail/17|Europa]],
