body: "Greetings!\r\nI've long appreciated the simplicity of the typeface for the
  Gilbert Paper logo. Before they are completely gobbled up by Neenah, I'd love to
  try to figure out what it's set in [or based on]. I've tried uploading it to 'What
  the Font' on the MyFonts site, as I usually find it helpful when in pursuit of a
  particular face, but the results aren't even close. Any thoughts?\r\nThanks in advance,
  Typophiles.\r\n-Anne\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ltg_5851.gif]"
