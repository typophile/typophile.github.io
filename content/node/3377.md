body: I&#39;m currently working on a student project where I&#39;m supposed to do
  a movie poster. Now I&#39;m struggeling with the hard work in finding two different
  fonts. The first one, and the most significant, is the font often used to present
  the director aso. in the &#34;footer&#34; of the poster &#40;see army of darkness&#41;.
  The second one is a font similar to the one used for the movie Casablanca &#40;see
  Casablanca&#41;. <BR> <BR>Look at the two images attached. <BR> <BR>I have found
  one font simmilar to &#34;casablanca&#34; but , unfortunatelly for me, it cost some
  money. My student budget doesn&#39;t have any space for this kind of investments

  body: Does anyone of you know ANY condensed font that is free of no charge? A quick
    search in google and evreka gives only commercial hits.

    fonts!

  body: You can also try looking through <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/fonts/d2.html"
    target="_blank">Ray Larabie&#39;s site</a>. If you can&#39;t find enough variety
    there to make your posters, then you aren&#39;t showing much creativity. At least
    this site will not have re-named copies of commercial fonts, even if some are
    inspired by certain ones.
