  am using a win xp platform.\r\n\r\nI find it quite frustrating that some font preview
  programs only look into one folder, and not multiple levels of folders.\r\n\r\nI
  find this very time consuming, and eats into project times, when trying to find
  the 'right' font.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest anything?\r\n\r\nWould have searched
  the forums, but couldnt find a search facility.\r\n\r\nThanks"
