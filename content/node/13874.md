    cooperation here: I suggest you refine your Google search, and keep plugging away.
    Even free stuff costs something, if only a little effort.'

    the ultimate list) of commercial and non-comercial font suppliers for chinese
    fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/china.html\r\n\r\n(he has lists like
    that for other languages as well.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nJH, London"
