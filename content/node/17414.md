body: Hi guys, newbie around... i am  working on this rest room signage for an eco-touristic
  hotel at Mexico. A lot of foreigners come and stay here, so i dont know how to approach
  the work in order to function for a multicultural public. I started with these characters
  i made for the kids summer camp instead of using the neutral look, i think this
  can be good but i want to listen good critique... thanks for helping.

    may be confused, because male frogs are generally smaller and more angular than
    female frogs (eco tourists know stuff like that). Some might even think the cute
    frog with the lashes and flower denoted the john for drag queens.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much Nick. In fact there is a broad public here not only ecotourists,
    also locals, lots of kids and regular non eco tourists which may find the flower
    cute, like hawaii welcome style. Although, what\xB4s wrong with sterotypes anyway
    in this case?, i think stereotyping may be efective sometimes to put generic things
    in its very own place, in this case its not generic but gender. Anyway, does anybody
    knows something like a restroom signage collection? \r\n"

    book</a> has, amongst many other pictograms, quite a few toilet signs.\r\nI think
    that any multi-language signage should, if practicable, avoid type or clearly
    define the languages, possibly by different fonts or members of a type family.
    I think that many would find your illustrations confusing or at least hindering,
    it might be an obvious/cliche solution but the silhouette style of man and woman
    is internationally known, when somebody is looking for a toilet the silhouette
    symbol(s) are what they would expect/hope to see, there is still room for applying
    a style. Does the other signage in the hotel include the frog motif or do these
    work on their own, in which case how does it relate to that signage?\r\nTim"
