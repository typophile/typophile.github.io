  for me [ Dr Duckling | Design care ] when I started as a freelancer.\r\nI happen
  to really like it and want it to be a part of my visual identity again.\r\nSo I
  thought I should make some improvements on it since I think that the old version
  really needed a \"ravalement de fa\xE7ade\"...\r\nSo the logo on top is the old
  one the new version is the one below.\r\nCan you guys tell me what you think?\r\nThanks."

    :\r\n- visually evoke the 3 Ds in \"Dr Duckling | Design...\"\r\n- visually evoke
    the C of \"...Care\"\r\n- the C also shapes a moon \"croissant\", which I find
    very symbolic for women, which I am...\r\n- using a bird's eye because a duckling
    is a bird (still)\r\n- using an eye to evoke (\xE6sthetic) vision as it seems
    to be appropriate and reflects a designer's maybe most important quality\r\n-
    the whole symbol is definitely inspired my native americans ones (as you may have
    noticed already), and this particular one was meant to protect (care...) and also
    to suggest an anticipative vision (watch, obsverse, be aware, anticipate) which
    is also very much part of a designer's job to me.\r\n\r\nOk I really don't think
    what I said is clear here, one more time sorry for my poor english...\r\n"

    not sure that matters. I''m a bit bothered tho by the white shape (neg space)
    inside the inner D to the left of the circle, or eye. I''m not sure why you rounded
    the corners or angled it outward towards the circle. It doesn''t seem to fit in
    with the other shapes. I also think the thickness of the middle or white D should
    be even as it is in the outer D. '

    it. I prefer the bottom version.\r\nthe first thing that struck me was that the
    logo kind of vanishes into nothing on the right hand side. I got used to that
    after a while though. \r\n\r\nWhat i would arrange would be the outer shape of
    the eye. I would do away with the 3 'D's and focus on making the shape of the
    eye more flowing and organic on the left hand side. "

    I like the round corners at the top opposing the square corners at the bottom,
    but I think you need to work on the curves. The counter thickens through the curve.\r\n\r\nb)
    The two inner counters share a sameness in the bottom version, which I like. I
    like the croissant better. The eye is harder to read. Maybe the first of the inner
    counters should be shorter, vertically, to give the pupil more prominence(?)"

  body: The female version adds a certain amount of whimsy to the logo, which isn't
    bad. But I lean towards masculine version because it reminds me of West Coast
    native art. However, why a French graphic designer would want a logo that evokes
    North American native art confuses me. (Unless you also illustrate in that style???)
    So maybe the whimsical female version is better. I don't know. I'm afraid I'm
    not being very helpful.

    I must point out that it is not Inuit. It is Kwakiutl. The Kwakiutl are one of
    the tribes that live along the west coast of Canada. They are master woodcarvers,
    best known for their totem poles, cedar longhouses and ceremonial masks. But their
    artwork also encompasses stone sculpture, jewellery, painting and printmaking.
    Your kingfisher is a truly wonderful example of the graphic Kwakiutl style. Black
    and red are the traditional colours. Sometimes a dark green or blue is added.
    How long have you had the print?\r\n\r\nCheers, Ken\r\n\r\n"

    There are a number of websites out there that track West Coast prints.  I'd google
    \"Kwakiutl Kingfisher\" and see what sort of hits you get.  I bought what was

    piece is titled \"Kwaguilth Cannibal Bird\" (in the lower left corner), and is

    is Coast Salish, not Kwakiutl or Haida. The museum tells me he illustrates in
    the Kwakwaka'wakw style. Whatever that is. Anyway, I think Jimmy is the artist
    of your Kingfisher.\r\n\r\nVirginie: Sorry, I think I've been hijacking this thread.
    How is your logo coming along. Have you decided on the female or male version?
