body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : x-height</strong>\r\n\r\nSuccinctly
  put, the x-height is the height of the [[Lowercase|lowercase]] x in a given alphabet.\r\n\r\nIn
  the past x-height was stated by some as a proportion of the [[Cap Height|cap height]].
  In digital fonts, the x-height is specified in the font as a proportion of the [[Em|Em]],
  typically with 1000 or 2048 units to the Em. Additionally, many typographers state
  the x-height as a proportion of the total vertical span of the lowercase, often
  limited to simply the ascender height. This practice is based on the realization
  that lowercase letters constitute approximately 95% of text.\r\n\r\nMany regard
  the relative x-height of a given typeface as a factor in readability, believing
  that a larger x-height better accentuates the distinguishing characteristics of
  the lowercase letters simply because the main body of the letters are larger. For
  this reason it is a commonly held notion that smaller x-heights are better reserved
  for [[display type]] where an enlarged size compensates for diminished readability.
  On the other hand, because reading is quite heavily dependent on the overall shape
  of the word, especially the top \"edge\", if x-height is very big the contrast between
  ascenders and the body of letters tends to be reduced, making text harder to read
  for longer periods. (Just as lines set in all capitals are generally regarded as
  difficult for extended reading.) Larger x-heights may also require more leading
  at a given point size for good readability. \r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
