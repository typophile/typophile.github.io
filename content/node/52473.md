  body: That's an old pre-digital font called Herold Condensed. Unfortunately I can't
    find a digital match for it. But it's in my Expertype typositor book from back
    in the day.

  body: THe sample book I have only lists the name of the font, in the font, no complete
    alphabets. And since there is no 'g' in the name.

  body: Thanks guys for your input, these "pre-digital" fonts confuse me. I don't
    know much about the history of printing but this book was published in 1975. Would
    it have been printed with a letterpress? Why is it that all they nice fonts are
    "pre-digital".. Just my luck. While I'm ranting does anybody now how poster designers
    "The Small Stakes" "Aesthetic Apparatus" and the like use such old fashioned typefaces?

  body: "Between metal and digital there was film. Typesetters used a cumbersome machine,
    and there was either \"text\" or \"display\" (or typositor) type. The latter was
    for  headlines only and set as strips, usually charged by the word. Herold Condensed
    was a display font. Text fonts were run as galleys. Designers didn't set their
    own type, we ordered it from type shops. It was all very expensive and there was
    little room for error, you really had to know what you were doing before you ordered
    the type. As a result you learned to think differently, to sketch, to do character
    counts and cast-offs.\r\n\r\nWhy are all the nice fonts pre-digital? I dunno,
    there are some pretty nice digital fonts too."

  body: Thank you so much, you are indeed a clever person. Do you know if the film
    sheets had a  name? You have definitely cleared things up for me, so thanks again.

  body: "Yes, it's the Compressed version of Herold Reclameschrift, by Heinz Hoffmann,
    released by Berthold in early 1900s. Born as a metal typeface, I'm not sure whether
    a photocomposition version exists, while it seems to exist for the Condensed version,
    from the catalog found by Patty.\r\n\r\nIt's one of my favorite typefaces, but
    unfortunately it seems the only available digital versions which exist (Berthold,
    Berlin Type Foundry and Paratype) are also of the Condensed and Bold Condensed
    weights only, and they are missing the one-storey [g].\r\n\r\nEDIT: Andreas Seidel
    produced a digital version which seems pretty good, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/astype/heraut-as/|Heraut
    AS]]. Again, it's Bold Condensed olny (no Compressed, which is the one you seek)
    but it seems includes almost all glyph variations and the beautiful politypes.
    A PDF is [[http://new.myfonts.com/clickthru.php?7700|here]]."
