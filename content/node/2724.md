  body: They are both bad.  <BR> <BR>With missing screen fonts, you cannot use the
    font at all. <BR> <BR>With missing PostScript fonts you cannot print or display
    the font on-screen except in whatever bitmap sizes are available &#40;usually
    only a few&#41;. The font will also look very distorted and chunky except at those
    sizes. This will be especially noticeable at large sizes. You may not be able
    to use the font at all with some programs. You will also not see any anti-aliasing
    on-screen.
