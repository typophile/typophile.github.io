  body: "I'm not sure New Deal has anything to do with the mafia, per se. It's more
    about 1930s America (of which the mafia was a part). So there are lots of ways
    you could go with this. \r\n\r\nBut if you're interested in something similar,
    have a look at <a href=\"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/14740\">WPA
    Gothic</a> and let me know if you want to use it commercially."
