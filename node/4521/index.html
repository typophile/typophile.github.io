I personally think anonymous posting should be allowed (for reasons that Jared articulated), but clearly anonymous *attacks* (or worse yet, anonymous defamation campaigns) can cause severe damage to Typophile itself. From my experience, certain people have no qualms about trying to bring down an entire channel of discussion/communication if it happens not to be going their way; sabotage is justified for them simply because it serves their self-righteous (and very selfish) ideals. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logistically, there are no obvious/trivial solutions, but I'm not worried that the Typophile boys will do what's needed, when it's needed - which might [justifiably] include nipping this problem in the bud. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

I'm willing (and possibly unlike you *able*) to learn, and I've found that going out on a limb is a great strategy in this respect (because too often people who have valuable information will only reveal it in some form of self-defense), as long as you can take the occasional slip (which I can). The problem is that some people here are not interested in learning, just yelling. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we must focus on 20/600, I can safely say: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was much less wrong than *you* still are now! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I think I would tend to side with someone like Erik Spiekermann <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I learned a lot from Spiekermann's post. And actually much of what he wrote (not the little snippets you wasted your time compiling, like some hapless lawyer, but the *good* stuff which is *always* between in lines) gave me more confidence that 600 was way off (again, remember: using my definition). I side with nobody, except what makes *sense*; no single person is omniscient, and certainly not 100% objective. If you could be just over 50% objective, you might get my point.

		<div class="commentbody">not to toot my own horn, but i've made a living purely on type design for the past three years - no freelance. the secret is to cut out the middleman and be your own foundry - i make 87% off each sale rather than 20-40% that other foundrys offer. i admit i'm in a niche market, but i net around $300 a day.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all of the comments I read here are interesting, some amusing, some not so. Erik Spiekermann's comments were obviously the most informed. Just my 2 cents, I think it about as likely to make a decent living these days from type design as it is from graphic design in general. The true &quot;democritization&quot; of design has happened, i.e., everyone with a computer is a designer. This subject has been touched upon by some in other venues. There can't be more than a very small number, 600 ? someone said, perhaps Erik, worldwide who make a living designing type fonts. But, I still do this stuff when I can and enjoy it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jordan</div>
