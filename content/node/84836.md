body: "Here's my latest font in the making.  It is inspired by a font ID request here
  on Typophile which went unsolved.  Inspired in that I've taken the basic feel of
  that font and some of its characteristics (mostly the crescent shaped half ball
  terminals - I'm sure there must be a proper name for these) and 'transplanted' them
  onto a Plantin-based text font I was already working on.  Please note the only thing
  I've taken from Plantin are the basic proportions and metrics (and for the time
  being, kerning, which I will no doubt scrap and start from scratch as the need arises).
  \ The outlines are all my own.  What do you think?  Specifically, what are people's
  thoughts on 'borrowing' metrics from other fonts.  Surely this doesn't constitute
  any copyright infringement.  I definitely remember reading an interview with a type
  designer recently (I forget her name) where she said she usually starts a new design
  from an existing one.\r\n\r\nAnyway, any criticism is greatly appreciated.  The
  aim is to make a readable text font (for print more than for screen) with a bit
  of character.  I'm undecided on the Nike-esque swooshes, and I think the serifs
  being thicker than some of the thins maybe looks a little odd, but sometimes odd
  is good?!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Newfontuntitled_3459.jpg]\r\n\r\nPS.

  body: Just to be clear on this, I haven't opened Plantin and changed a few points.  I've
    made a new font from scratch for which proportions were influenced by Plantin
    and kerning has been imported from Plantin (for the time being - I will definitely
    change it because it doesn't fit my design as well as 'homemade' kerning would).  So
    I'm not trying to 'get away with' creating a new font quickly by modifying an
    existing one.  I will freely admit that spacing is not my strong point and to
    this end, I have looked at how other fonts space glyphs as a starting point.  There's
    obviously a lot more tweaking to be done on this one.  In the end, I dare say
    it will bear little resemblance to Plantin.  What do you think?  Is it looking
    derivative?  That is 100% not my intention.  I give credit to designers who make
    revivals but that's not my thing.  I think back to art lessons in school, where
    we would paint copies of old masters' works.  The teachers weren't trying to create
    a bunch of forgers, but to make us identify their techniques and learn from them.  That
    is what I'm trying to do here, but if appropriating similar spacing from pre-existing
    fonts is frowned upon, I'll simply keep the outlines and space them myself, for
    better or for worse.  I hate spacing so much I might even consider iKern.  Has
    anybody used this service?  What did you think?

    from a printout. They don't look quite delicate enough, and perhaps they could
    be more inclined. I like the direction of this, Plantin is really one of my favourites,
    and I really admire Kris Sowersby's Tiempos, which reimagines Plantin very crisply.

    that way!\r\nAs I said, there's no kerning for now so it should give a clearer

    out the terminals a bit more and let the counters breathe.\r\n\r\n1 might benefit
    from a wider head.\r\n\r\n6 looks a little squashed.\r\n\r\n/R/ is causing spacing

    curly serifs on E and F but I think the new ones are better because they give
    the crossbar more room.  I've decided on the above compromise - basically took
    out one anchor point and the serifs are now half way between before and after.
    \ Much happier with the T - it's starting to look more like a T and less like
    a palm tree!\r\n<cite>BTW remember to take my suggestions with plenty of salt

    \ But seriously - I'm not going to go through it changing everything people suggest.
    \ Mostly it's a case in the critique section of people pointing things out which
    I'd notice myself if I was critiquing someone else's font, but when you stare
    at the same thing for too long you get blind to it.\r\nThe connected italics idea
    was just a thought really because my first stabs at drawing the italic look pretty
    rubbish.  Trying to find a way of getting the 'foxiness' of the upright into it,
    but I've had a go at connected italics and this is definitely not the way to go
    with it."
