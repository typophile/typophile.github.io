  the star treatment.  Give it up for [[http://typetrust.com/font/cooterdeuce|Cooter
  Deuce]].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the original [[http://typetrust.com/font/cooter|Cooter]]
  offers a grab-bag of solid and counterpunched letterforms, [[http://typetrust.com/font/cooterdeuce|Cooter
  Deuce]] has been split in two. The Regular style is endowed with a full set of counterpunched
  forms while the Plugged has its bowls and most of its counters filled or reduced
  for a heavier impression.\r\n\r\nCompared to its predecessor, [[http://typetrust.com/font/cooterdeuce|Cooter
  Deuce]] has been drawn with more consistently square proportions, and a handful
  of glyphs have been entirely redesigned. Taking advantage of the Opentype format,
  it has even been fleshed out with a bevy of alternate glyphs, dingbats, and nifty
  decorative ligatures.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/specimen_pdfs/TypeTrust-CooterDeuce.pdf|Here's
  a Cooter Deuce PDF.]]\r\n\r\nIf you've purchased the original [[http://typetrust.com/font/cooter|Cooter]]
  at [[http://typetrust.com|TypeTrust.com]], there's a free upgrade available for
  download via the Order History pages of your TypeTrust Account.  Some linework and
  kern pairs have been adjusted.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CooterDeuce01_4412.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CooterDeuce02_6267.png]"
