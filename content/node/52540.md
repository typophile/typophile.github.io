  news release==============\r\n\r\nA fresh new decorative display face bubbling with
  life & spontaneity, Jabberwub belongs to a rare genus of creature fonts that type
  forgot\u2014casual animated. A fun & bouncy eye-catcher dancing a whacky line between
  discord & rhyme, Jabberwub packs tons of fun into a state-of-the-art OpenType font
  loaded with 270 extra glyphs, including stylistic alternates, discretionary ligatures,
  word ligatures and capitalized ligatures, allowing creative typographers to achieve
  a custom hand-lettered look without all the mess & spilt glue of a manual paste-up
  job.\r\n\r\nJabberwub is ideal for whatever zany stuff springs to mind. It takes
  an outline with no problem-o, and you can squish & squoosh it as the occasion takes
  your fancy. Optimal results are achieved by hand setting each individual glyph.
  Available in OpenType only.\r\n\r\nJabberwub can be viewed and test driven now at
  Myfonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jabberwub/\r\n\r\n==============end

    Fanta to some eyes. But you should know I have redefined what an \"o-n\" ligature
    looks like. I'm waiting for Coca-Cola's branding communications peeple to tell
    me I've violated their Fanta trademark. They will have a very hard time trying
    to prosecute me for violation of the Fanta trademark.\r\n\r\nClue: it's done with
    permission, and aesthetic license.\r\n\r\n@Muzzer: <em>I thought you said this

    like \"a-n\"!\r\nBut don't worry, I suspect that people are aware script is a
    more personal expression than type, done with aesthetic licence, and employ \"reading
    licence\", turning up the readerability knob a notch and enjoying the mayhem.
    Or maybe script plays up the game-like, puzzle-solving dimension of reading."

  body: "I ain't worryin'. And yes I think you're ryte as usual, script lettering
    is a personal expressiveness type of thing. In effect I'm scaling the edge of
    readerability / readability while firing a shot into the trademark maelstrom to
    see what happens there.\r\n\r\nI always do research before deciding on a retail
    font's name, to find out how widespread prior use (if any exists) of the name
    has been in the public domain. A google search of \"fonta\" turns up soome fascinating
    prior uses of it as a trademark, none of them registered. So the Coke peeple,
    if they ever bother hassling me about this) will have to admit widespread prior
    use of the letter string \"fonta\" by numerous companies and private individuals,
    whose use of \"fonta\" as a business name / brand has not diluted Coke's registered
    Fanta trademark. If Coke go for similar wordmark conflict, well, we'll see about
    that. Their claim would have to include an argument for dilution of the Fanta
    wordmark, and that could take a long time to hammer out out-of-court. Meantime
    I get a free ride with my Fonta mark acting as the pivot for the Jabberwub branding
    communications scheme.\r\n\r\nFor readers interested in prior use of \"Fonta\",
