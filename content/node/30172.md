  and am looking for an appropriate typeface. I'm looking for something clean, sans
  serif, and perhaps humanist. Really looking for something that would fit with a
  sort of new age vitality mentality without being trendy. Feel free to plug your
  own work, I'm looking for some suggestions to table to the client.\r\n\r\nJ."

    from Porchez is lovely too.\r\n\r\nJigsaw"

  body: "There are so many new and nice San Serif faces out there - and that does
    seem like a nice path for you to be on for this project.\r\n\r\nI love Today Sans
    - but only in the lighter weights. The other suggestions are nice as well.\r\n\r\nA
    newer font that was brought to my attention from a French designer is Kievit.
    (He is making me use it in a project he is working on - and it's growing on me...
    replacing Frutiger and Formata for that matter)\r\n\r\nIf not for this project
    - it may still be worth a look-sie to keep in mind when you are looking for a
    san serif that is well drawn and you are tired of the others...\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/\r\n\r\n"
