body: This summer Dan Morris is going to teach letterpress printing at the Cooper
  Union. The classes start next week. Dan is a very cool guy and he has helped bringing
  our printshop up to speed. I think that this class could be great for the type obsessed
  here in the New York area. I am certainly going to try to get into this class and
  thought I should advertise it here. Read more on <a href="http://www.typedu.org/dynamic/blog/letterpress_course_cooper_union">TypEdu</a>.
