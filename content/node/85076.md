  body: ">For example Neo Sans in headline with other sans-serif in bodytext.\r\n\r\nThat's
    a very broad description. Can you tell us what the text is about, what mood and
    tone you're trying to achieve, how the text will be set, and whether it's a book,
    newspaper, website, leaflet or poster.\r\n\r\nAlso perhaps if you suggest other
    typefaces you're considering you'll get the discussion going a bit."

  body: Your question is sort of like asking "what should I serve with chicken?"  Without
    knowing if it is KFC, Bombay Chicken Curry or Lemon Pepper Cappellini with Chicken
    Cutlets Brasciole one can't give a meaningful suggestion.  That is why you are
    getting no responses.  Hope that helps.
