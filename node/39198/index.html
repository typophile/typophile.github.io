  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all.

I'm making a vector logotype for my self. Please take a look.

http://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/b23d9de286.jpg

I'm inspired by "moroccan mosaic green", the roman laurel wreath and the arab union flag. I used live trace on a photoshop image, so it's really ugly when zooming in. And I'm not good at all using the pen in illustrator. 

Is it possible that you could help me with the vector graphic? I will send you the .AI and a symbolic sum of money if you decide to help me.

What do you think about the font and the tracking/kerning?

Thanks in advance for any help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you are a designer, it would be really better to learn the Illustrator instead of asking someone for the help. That will help you for the long run. Just try it yourself and you will find comfort in few days. And if you are not a designer, its better to hire someone.

I found "Guedira" too tight and big compared to that symbol.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How will that wreath look when it is reduced to fit on a business card logo? Still recognizable as such? A company I worked for (not a design place) used a circuit board pattern as roots of a tree. 

It looked great when the tree was 18 inches tall, as it probably was in the original presentation, but it looked like a blob on the business cards, envelopes, and letterhead. Even on the web pages, which is a sin for a tech company.

My point: Be careful about using complex elements in your design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Honestly, I think it's a bit tight. And the wreath is...disconnected? Yea, it's doesn't match up with it at all. It seems like you just threw it on for the hell of it. 
Increase the tracking just a small bit on Guedira...actually...try just increasing the kerning between the G and u.
I think that may make it just a bit easier to read.

Have you tried a more stylized wreath? That wreath is too generic...and I'm not totally sure, but I think I saw a similar wreath in a business card gallery book I have...
I'm not too sure what to do about the wreath though...it just feels too thrown on to me...
Ah...could be just me, anyone else think so?

		<div class="commentbody">OK Fernando, get ready because I'm known for not being extremely nice when criticizing.

My personal opinion is that this logo is very poor. The juxtaposition of two similar G's side by side is making my eyes bleed. I read gguedira. The typeface is way too tightly spaced, it's the kind of type you shouldn't play too much with. Also, if it is, as I think I understand, a logo for a graphic designer, it is really pretentious, with the wrath imagery and the Garamond and everything... Especially now that I can realize how good you are with vector, I think that to show off with such a logo is like shooting yourself in the foot. 

My advice, if you are even remotely interested in it: either go extreme in the traditional / baroque / napoleonian imagery, in order to express a safety distance / second degree (center the symbol above the name, compose in heavy fraktur, etc), or go safe and humble and give up the wrath and serif, think modern and simple.

I hope i didnt discourage you,
