body: In a monospaced font all the characters must have the same width or the same
  sidebearings?

  body: 'What''s the same is I believe called the ''advance width''--the width of
    the black part plus the side bearings. '

  body: Sidebearings would definitely differ. For instance an O will have smaller
    sidebearings than an H.

  body: "Think of how things look when you type on a typewriter-- you know, those
    noisy things with levers or a ball that slams the page each time you hit a key--
    I probably haven't used one in 10 years, but I remember them! :-)\r\n\r\nEvery
    glyph in a true monospaced font will live in a space of the same width, and this
    space can be thought of as the equivalent of a cell in a grid in which every column
    is the same width. It doesn't matter how wide or narrow the black is, or what
    the dimensions of the sidebearings are, at least by themselves. The key is that
    every glyph's little \"cell\" is the same width (and, for all practical purposes,
    the same height, too)."
