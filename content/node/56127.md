    like. How does the OU combination look like? '

  body: Well, that looks perfectly good. I guess you have to change the Q, or make
    a QU-ligature that takes advantage of the optical effect, and pronounces it. Nice
    letters, by the way! Are you going to post this in the critique section?

    easy ;)\r\n\r\nSince the Q pushes the U up, one solution might be making a QU
    ligature with an optical correct U."

  body: "Overshoot depends on three variables, width, shape and weight of the baseline
    and cap ht. features, and is character not character group specific. So, if the
    U is considerably narrower than the O in a thin face, but has the same overshoot,
    it looks like this one. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
