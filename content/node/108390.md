  yet on Fontforge and I am struggling to find a way to scale down my caps without
  changing their weights. It would avoid me to scale down then manually increase weight
  for each letter, which would make me go crazy for sure haha.\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  help, I would appreciate!"

  body: "There is the feature Element>Styles>Change Weight that can be used to restore
    the weight of your small caps after you scale them down, but I don't find it quite
    satisfactory. \r\n\r\nLooks like there's another issue to put in the queue."

    are synthesized (if H is selected, the smallcap that is generated is named h.sc). '

    body: "I thought I'd seen it before. Yes! The Add Small Capitals feature only
      appears in the Element>Style submenu in the Font window (where you see all the
      letters in the font in little boxes), not in the Glyph window (where you edit
      outlines) where I'd been looking for it.\r\n\r\nYou may still have to tweak
      the generated glyphs since these automated processes are rarely perfect, but
      it should be much less trouble than what you were doing before."

  body: If, on the other hand, your capitals in general are too tall, there is also
    the Element>Style>Change x-height feature that you can use to make your lowercase
    letters taller without changing their weight, which would get you a similar net
    effect.

  body: "Are you going to have more than one weight for this typeface anyway, say
    a regular and a bold?\r\n\r\nIf so, generally, the \"best\" way to do this sort
    of thing is to start by designing your typeface with a weight axis. From there
    you can generate things like small caps, correct the weight automatically, and
    have it be pretty nearly perfect right off. You can do the small caps in the bold
    master by extrapolation."

    URW++ will be released probably later this year. One of its nifty functions is
