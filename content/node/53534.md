  body: It's definitely not ITC Century. Take a close look at the g and the t and
    a. It's more like [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90026.html|Berthold
    Walbaum Standard]] than anything else. Storm's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/walbaum-text/|Walbaum]]
    will give you a more realistic letterpress color, however.
