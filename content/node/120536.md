  Schwartz' breathtaking Giorgio Sans. (I'm aware there's also a serif but that isn't
  going to work for anything other than decorative text.) \r\n\r\nIt's for a company
  that, ironically, does branding itself. They are a nice kind of snobby, if you know
  what I mean, somewhere between high-brow and witty. That's why I'm looking for something
  classic (Antiqua), not too low on the x, with nice contrasts but also quite legible
  on screen. I was thinking along the lines of Weidemann's Corporate A, but I don't
  want them look like a Mercedes knock-off, especially since they are based in Germany.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your suggestions. This is my first venture into the hallowed halls
  of typophile, so please be nice. \r\n\r\nBen"

  body: "Wow, that was quick! Cheers riccardo. I did consider \u203Asubtly squared\u2039,
    as in Guardian Text or Parachute's Centro Slab. But even as, technically, those
    go rather well will Giorgio Sans, I found them to lack the \u203Aje-ne-sais-quoi\u2039
    factor I'm after, the one that comes with the more classic form language of the
    Caslons and Bodonis, especially when printed. (I hope I am making sense here.)"

    body: 'It definitely ticks most of the aforementioned boxes: stylish, classic,
      rich in contrast, high x. My only reservation would be legibility in small sizes
      and on screen: The Walbaums I worked with (Linotype''s and Storm''s 120) didn''t
      do too well in those departments. Can you recommend a specific edition?'

    body: "Indeed! Humbled as I was by your reply, Mr Shinn, you shouldn't have hidden
      your own light under the bushel. I'll take your Walburn anytime over Felice
      (even though the latter does have all the frivolity of the native Giorgio but
      without its uselessness in text). As for Kepler, Les, I'd be the biggest fan
      if it wasn't for the italics that, personally, I consider somewhat clumsy. \r\nMy
      shortlist right now would be Walburn, Felice, Didot HFJ (6pt/11pt) and maybe
      a neat digital Walbaum that I have yet to discover. "

  body: "You said that you have used Storm\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typeface-walbaum-120-pro.html\">Walbaum
    120</a>. I presume that you know that this is the display cut of the family (it
    takes its name from the approximate point size it is best used at; cf. <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/services/get_pdf.php?family_id=107\">this
    PDF</a>). You might not know that there is also <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typeface-walbaum-10-pro.html\">Walbaum
    10</a> for text (at around 10 point) and even <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typeface-walbaum-10-xl-pro.html\">Walbaum
    10 XL</a> with increased x-height. I can recommend both. Have a look at them!"
