  i have no memories of seeing it properly done.  Now, at work, i have to do it for
  an interface, what rules should i observe?  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Basically, never ever stack it. Most likely you won't be using a fixed-width
    typeface, so the letters won't align at all, and readability will go right down
    the tubes. Set the text just as you would, then rotate it 90\xB0\u2026 Which direction
    you choose to rotate it is more up to you, but generally, it looks better if the
    baseline is facing the edge of your interface."

    would cause the least problems.\r\n\r\n"

    odd, but I guess someone had his heart set on that vertical sign.\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel"
