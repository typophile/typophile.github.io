    the font is Mueller, Richard W/Titania Regular and the /A is not as in KARAMAZOV...\r\n\r\n2.
    I can't find your /A regardless..."

  body: "More than you ever wanted to know on the font used in _The_\r\n\r\nI have
    not confirmed which of the various names for digital versions of this old font
    is match the name under which the original font was released.\r\n\r\nThere are
    interesting details in the font info for each of the fonts. I summarize them after
    each font name. First the copyright holder. Then the version info. finally other
    comments.\r\n\r\nAthenia.ttf\r\nThomas E. Harvey 1993 [seems identical to Athenian
    Normal but has strange date: \"Version 1.00 April 23, 1927, initial release]\"\r\n\r\nAthenian

    Eastern Europe, Turkish, Baltic, vietnamese. Includes \"gk\" logo. I wonder who
    \"gk\" is?\r\n\r\nEFN Melody.ttf\r\nEuroFONT 2002 [2.4] 375 glyphs. Same codepages
    as Mellotron but \"gk\" logo gone.\r\n\r\nKarissa.ttf\r\nBright Ideas, no date

    i.e. Dieter Steffmann 2001 [\"1.2\"] Glyphs seem to match Karissa's--except for
    ps->tt conversion variation. Minor difference in number of glyphs 245 v. 248.\r\n\r\nTitania.ttf\r\nTypographer
    Mediengestaltung, i.e. Dieter Steffmann 2001 [\"1.3; 2001\"]\r\n\r\nTitania MF.ttf\r\nRick

    dates suggests Thomas E. Harvey & Rick Mueller were the first to [independently?]
    digitize the font in 1993.\r\n\r\nThe name Titania is used for a font shown on
    page 44 of the Solo Catalog that looks like these fonts. According to the \"Solocat\"
    A \"Solofont digital version included in Dover/Solofont Art Nouveau book + CD
    pack.\" Info for the solo Titania font: Dan X. Solo. 1998 [Macromedia Fontographer
    4.1.5 9/4/98]. The glyph data in Steffman's 2001 Titania match the Solo Titania.\r\n\r\nMight
    as well call it Titania.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"

    where that A came from... \r\nbut great to know Titania, and Radiant Condensed
    does seem a very close fit. "
