body: "Helloo everyone! I was browsing Hello Hikimori's portfolio when i came across
  this typeface i know i've seen before. I always thought it was custom, but i've
  seen it used as red vinyl on a white wall somewhere. I'm currently searching for
  said photo, but i was hoping to see if anyone here had any idea what this font is!\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/202w3z2y430Q2A161S1D\r\nI
  know the font projected onto the large type is Lace by HKI, but what is the name
  of the font that it is projected on. Anyone have an idea?\r\n"
