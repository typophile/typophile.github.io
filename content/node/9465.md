body: I&#39;m designing cards for a friend for free so I don&#39;t want to spend too
  much time on them. This is what I came up with. He wanted to use his sky blue Mark
  VI pimpmobile as the central feature -- Big Blue is the car&#39;s name. The cards
  are 2 color, full bleed, and &#40;obviously&#41; die cut. Any thoughts either from
  a design or production standpoint? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66224.jpg"

  body: John it would be nice to use the same typeface as the name of the car for
    the title. What is Big Blue Pictures? Film production studio, photographer, movie
    producer?

  body: Thanks for taking a peek, Dan. <BR> <BR>BBP is a one man film production studio.
    <BR> <BR>Do you mean use a typeface similar to what&#39;s on the car? That might
    be cool. I&#39;ll have to think about that.

  body: Whatever typeface you use, I&#39;d let it loose from the box. Give it some
    forced perspective and let it be as big and pimpin&#39; as the car photo. <BR>
    <BR>A lot of the elements feel like they&#39;re floating around right now. To
    give things more weight and grounding, perhaps try making the the card sit flat
    &#40;no matter how it&#39;s shaped&#41; and keep the type and images grounded
    to those angles. That car needs to feel heavy and grounded, rather than floaty
    and light. <BR> <BR>&#40;Does that make sense?&#41;
