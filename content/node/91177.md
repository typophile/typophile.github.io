body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm looking for a font that would resemble the fonts used for the
  numbers on old radios or car dashboards, 40's-60's. They style I'm looking for is
  Condensed.\r\nHere's an example:\r\n[[http://www.google.com/imgres?q=vintage+radio&um=1&hl=en&client=safari&sa=N&rls=en&authuser=0&biw=1280&bih=664&tbm=isch&tbnid=Eq__uTkPZhmzAM:&imgrefurl=http://www.jscott1.com/id5.html&docid=YcgZJwiBYqsTxM&imgurl=http://www.jscott1.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/VintageRadio.jpg&w=512&h=333&ei=M9BlT_C8Keml0QXrlomnCA&zoom=1|Vintage

  body: Most likely this is custom lettering. I think somebody here mentioned that
    this ultra-condensed style is called 'gaspipe', but that is about the extent of
    my knowledge.

    I'm looking for suggestions for fonts of this style \"gaspipe\". Any suggestions?"
