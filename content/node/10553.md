  body: Beautiful cover. <BR> <BR>Well dang. I can&#39;t read what they wrote about
    Typographica <BR>and our blog friends because that section isn&#39;t translated  <BR>to
    English. Any help for a dullard unilingual? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70731.gif"

  body: 'When I corresponded with Fontlab recently, they said the Mac version wasn&#39;t
    going to be available until this fall. As in, more than a few months away. This
    is kind of a bummer for me, because I don&#39;t want to buy the product and then
    have to pay to upgrade it a few months later. Oh well! <BR> <BR>More to the point:
    new TYPO! I&#39;m excited! Especially about the Preissig article. Storm has recently
    issued their typefaces as OpenType fonts &#40;including the Czech type library
    and their versions of Preissig Antikva and Preissig 1918&#41;, for those who didn&#39;t
    know.'
