body: I'm a student and I have to base a multi executional design based on a single
  typeface. The idea is to design a font package with a with cd and booklet displaying
  the uses for this particular font. The problem is I have no information on the font
  I can find. If anyone knows any history on Opti Sans Serif Shaded and Opti Sans
  Serif Condensed One or any information on what opti fonts are period.
