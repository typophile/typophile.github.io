    like to think of ourselves as secretive, very secretive, in fact the name of the
    studio is one no one, not even long-standing clients remember or can spell. Anywho,
    point is we&#39;re not into navel-gazing, and took our site down after we noticed
    a familiar IP # snooping around the portfolio and  informative strategy pages
    we had with messaging matrix tables, ect. days before a major proposal was due
    in town. We already knew they were bidding and found it suspicious. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    one should ask how often do you check out your peers as well.'

  body: Trying to impress your peers isn&#39;t always such a bad idea, since design
    firms tend to hire each quite frequently when they have excess work and tight
    deadlines. <BR> <BR>In many cases, I&#39;d rather do well-paid work for another
    design firm that understands the project and the medium, than for a clueless client
    who refuses to communicate well or let me educate him. <BR> <BR>In my experience
    at least, not much work comes from regular clients who see the designer&#39;s
    website.  In most cases, one gets jobs through footwork and personal connections.  A
    lot of successful design firms don&#39;t even have websites up. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    talking about regular graphic design of course, and not type design. <BR> <BR>Paul

    all flexing muscles on websites how relevant is that to medium...I&#39;d say not
    much. <BR> <BR>forums and experiments sure - but a commercial site is almost redundant

    and useful, not having a site at all is becoming more than a competitive disadvantage,
    it&#39;s a liability; some people &#40;ahem&#41; live and die by the web, make
    their appointments to the vet based on what comes up in a google search, and even
    if it means impressing peers in the process my humble opinion is it&#39;s lazy
    not to have something up, even if it&#39;s just a page with your details: &#41; '

  body: yes I agree with Keith. <BR> <BR>my point before being that an online representation
    of design work &#40;unless its web design&#41; seems like fluff to the entire
    basis and background of the internet. Sure yes, some people are bound to it. I
    was one of them during my telecommuting stint...but I don&#39;t need a site for
    that. <BR> <BR>I donno, I&#39;m starting to hate the net more and more because
    people are proliferating it with junk. I don&#39;t think a design portfolio belongs
    on the net , its a matter of relevance &#40;yes I&#39;m a hypocrite and have one,
    its very old, never seen and coming down&#41;...but unless your offering those
    pictures in part with Case studies/forums or experiments, there&#39;s hardly a
    point. A liability....umm I&#39;m sure it depends what business your in and where.
    <BR> <BR>I guess my analogy here is that a commercial site seems like what a commercial
    is to television, and they just keep playing more and more and interrupt the show
    more frequently. Its cheap. <BR>

  body: Good points, Tanya. <BR> <BR>Funny thing is, when I became a designer, I was
    mostly interested in Web and Flash design.  But the more I&#39;ve learnt over
    the years, the more I&#39;ve come to prefer print design &#40;and more recently,
    type design&#41;. <BR> <BR>The signal-to-noise ratio is way too low out there.  Typographi.ca
    is like a haven. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'hey now, i like your site, tanya: &#41;  <BR> <BR>when i read the question
    &#34;do designers design their websites ...to impress their peers?&#34; i assumed
    design could mean both web and print design, web design in particular obviously
    being valuable to demonstrate on the web; my opinion &#40;which goes hand in hand
    with some other opinions about popup windows&#41; comes from having gotten a convincable
    amount of contracts/jobs/random interviews based on a humble web/print design
    portfolio website which i only pay 5$ CAD a month for, which doesn&#39;t popup
    or bother anybody but which does provide samples and contact info; better and
    better web content is of course always ideal; having said that i also prefer print
    design: &#41;'

  body: Some interesting points. Yes, the web has moved  <BR>beyond the brochure-ware
    of 1997 era sites. <BR> <BR>But why would you question a design portfolio on the  <BR>web?
    I&#39;ve landed many job interviews from my personal  <BR>site. It doesn&#39;t
    replace a physical portfolio, but it&#39;s been  <BR>invaluable. No, nobody goes
    to my site on their own  <BR>and says, &#39;we want to interview you.&#39; It&#39;s
    me sending an  <BR>email cover letter and finishing it with a URL. In the end,  <BR>it&#39;s
    a fairly easy way to &#39;prequalify.&#39; <BR> <BR>Further, why would you question
    a designers motives  <BR>for wanting to create a great site -- even if the  <BR>underlying
    motive is to one-up his/her peers? It&#39;s not  <BR>about showing off. It&#39;s
    about getting noticed; the same  <BR>reasons we have design contests. Of course,
    in the  <BR>end, it&#39;s about communicating who you are, which  <BR>comes across,
    not only through the work you show, <BR>but the way you show it.  <BR>

  body: hey micheal I just read the listserv and saw that. Those kinds of initiatives
    speak to the underlying altruism &#40;?&#41; in which I expect design to be an
    issue.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s that weird line where in the end the issues of design
    lay in the hands of those who aren&#39;t consiously promoting design, ever. Its
    that intuition past through the heart by the palpatating left ventrical...or something
    or other.
