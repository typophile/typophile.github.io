  it, as\r\nit was used by a graphic designer to design my logo who has gone\r\nMIA
  but I love the font and want to use it.\r\nAnyone who can help me will get lots
  of good karma, many thanks\r\nand a chocolate bar of your choice.\r\nI'm not kidding.
  I'll mail you some chocolate if you can help me!"
