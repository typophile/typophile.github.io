body: "In the recently released released version of my [[http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html|Old
  Standard]] font family I attempted to implement some support for enclosing combining
  marks, in particular U+20DD. I needed this for Old Cyrillic, where such marks are
  used to denote large numbers. The implementation looks basically us follows:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>An
  anchor point is used to attach the mark to the base character. Currently I don't
  handle those situations there the base character is too large to fit properly into
  the enclosing mark.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>A contextual positioning lookup is applied to
  increase the base glyph's offset and advance width, so that the mark doesn't overlap
  the surrounding characters.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I see that with
  most rendering engines my font doesn't work as expected:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Uniscribe
  just ignores enclosing combining marks and doesn't apply any lookups to them;</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Most
  other engines (InDesign, ICU) seem to share the same common problem: when the base
  glyph is shifted to right, its anchor points are moved not by the XPlacement value
  specified for the base glyph (as I would expect), but rather by XAdvance. Thus the
  mark is shifted much further to right than it should be;</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In InDesign
  things get even more complicated if there are additional combining marks attached
  to other anchor points of the same base glyph.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPango seems
  to be the only rendering engine which processes my font exactly as expected.\r\n\r\nNow
  the questions:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>To which feature should I attach my contextual
  GPOS lookups? Currently I mark them as required, but required GPOS lookups seem
  to be completely ignored by some engines (ICU, Mellel). Another option is to attach
  them to the 'kern' feature (as the specification seems to allow contextual kerning),
  but GPOS kerning is currently ignored by Uniscribe.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Is the behavior
  I have described caused by some bugs in rendering engines, or I am doing something
  wrong?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Should I post my questions also to the OpenType mailing list?</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n"
