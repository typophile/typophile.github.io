  I'm willing to know what do you think is the best way to present the fonts. I'm
  in doubt in using ohamburgfonstiv, lorem ipsum or ABCD abcd. \r\n\r\nWhat are your
  opinions/suggestions about it?"

  body: Willingness to know is the first step on the road to wisdom, O Grasshopper;
    however, I don't think there's any one-size-fits-all approach. Proper presentation
    of Ed Interlock and Benguiat Gothic would, I think, require entirely different
    approaches...
