  Gothic\r\nBenguiat Gothic\r\nBauhaus\r\n\r\nIt's for a project that serves as a
  cautionary tale for new designers against using these faces for text, or setting
  them at all. Please be frank, and hold nothing back. I need some good juicy bits
  for my project. \r\n\r\nSo go on, how bad are they really?"

    eyes will ultimately be the judge, not suggestions or juicy bits."

    So, it''s just an issue of using them appropriately. '
