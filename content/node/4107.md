  body: One thing I&#39;d bet is that the &#39;A&#39; is a modified N. Unfortunately,
    I don&#39;t recognize the basic font, although I like the graceful styling.

  body: I think this is a custom designed logo, but it&#39;s possible  <BR>they were
    inspired by something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot/demi/testdrive.html?s=Senna&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Peignot</a>. <BR>Two other typefaces that have a similarly structured
    &#34;S&#34;  <BR>are Emigre&#39;s <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PDogB.html"
    target="_blank"> Dogma</a> and MvB&#39;s <a href="http://mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/magnesium/pk_magnesium.htm"
    target="_blank"> Magnesium</a>.

  body: I think you were right the first time with Peignot. The lower case provides
    the &#39;ennn&#39; and the upper case provides the S, which is scaled down to
    match the size, and then thickened with some stroke addition. Here is what I got
    using Peignot light. I think Medium would have worked better, but it was all I
    had. I did some stretching, and flattening, and blocked out the right stem of
    the last n, and stretched out the apex by using a black triangle. Voila! &#40;almost&#41;
