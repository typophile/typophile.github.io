  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been working on a rounded style of Houschka for a while now. It's now OpenType as I have included some new features. Some people were put off the original Houschka because of the rounded shape of the A, W and w, (although a lot of others liked it for that very reason). So I have included contextual alternates of these characters in the new rounded version, as well as small caps (also with alternate A and W), lining and non-lining and tabular figures, and discretionary ligatures ct, sp and st.

Any other discretionary ligature suggestions?

Thanks,

Nick Gooke, G-Type</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking good!
But the x-height of u,v,w,x & y seems lower than the other characters. Don't know if this is intentional or just my eyes going bad ;-)
Also, the ox might need some extra kerning, it's a little too tight now in my opinion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like this a lot. I wasn't familiar with Houschka in its original incarnation, but i prefer it rounded, and in the light weight and would more likely use the NON rounded shape A and W's.

I'm seeing some glitches (white knockouts?) in Adobe Reader as certain zoom levels...

left stem of the m
left stem of the n (less so than the m)
AE combo overlap
g where the bowl enters the stem
G where the curve enters the stem

I guess you're probably aware of this if it's work in progress, but just though i'd better mention it.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for mentioning this, and I did know about it - it's the only may to blend certain characters between the two weight extremes, and will be rectified for the finished typefaces. You're right – this is a work in progress.

I actually prefer the round style to the original Houschka, plus I have improved the shapes in some characters.

The good thing about OpenType is that you can choose between the different styles of A and W's.

		<div class="commentbody">This would make a great addition to the surprisingly hit and miss category of rounded fonts. 

the p, q, b have the same corner treatment where the strokes moves from straight to curve, yet the d is a right angle, I rather enjoy the treatment of the p, q, b. you might even make the angle begin early in the vertical stroke. 

also, the rounds in the lowercase seem a bit inconsistent, the o, c, e seem to be based on a perfect circle while the g, p, d, b, q, have more robust curves. I feel perfect circles tend to have points on the upper and outermost extremes.

I dig it!</div>

Aaron, I have done another rounded family; Chevin. It has been adopted as the corporate type for Royal Mail in the UK.

The type 'WE ARE...etc' is set in it.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it's been a while, but here is a 6 page pdf showing the various weights of the finished family.

Houschka Rounded is pretty comprehensive with over 830 characters. It covers East and Central European, Turkish and Cyrillic. It has a standard character set, contextual and stylistic alternates, lining and old-style numbers, both proportional and tabular, small caps, and 3 extra stylistic sets (as shown on the pdf). The top example is the standard set (with small caps).
Set 1 is modernish, set 2 is Art Decoish and set 3 has unicase characters.

Please see new: HRtest2.pdf

The Thin style may be the thinnest rounded (terminals) font ever! Magnify the pdf and have a look.
