body: "I am looking for a new typeface to use for an existing line of quote t-shirts...and
  I am having a hard time. It is simply a quote printed at approx. 60pt. type...two
  or three lines of text...on various colored t-shirts...usually a front print. The
  existing font that has been used is Book Antiqua bold. These shirts are sold in
  a family of nostalgic general stores. Here are some basic guidelines for what I
  am looking for: \r\n\r\nNot too modern...or too clich\xE9 in terms of old-fashioned
  typefaces.\r\n\r\nSomething that wouldn't be completely inappropriate in an old
  general store.\r\n\r\nNeutral enough to appeal to men, women, and children of all
  ages. \r\n\r\nEasily distinguishable from previous typeface.\r\n\r\nEasy to read
  from a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Thanks."
