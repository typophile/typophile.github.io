  body: "There's things about these letters that don't look right together. That 'b'
    looks like an upside-down 'q' more than any 'b' I know, and the 'k' is strongly
    similar to mutilated Galliard. Speaking of mutilated, look at the 'T'.\r\n\r\nIt's
    like a font -Frankenstein's monster, maybe like a student's joke font project.
    The letters don't even seem to have a common baseline, or are my eyes just bleary
    this late in the day?\r\n\r\nJan, do you have samples of any more letters? Can
    you tell us the age or origin of the source for this sample?\r\n\r\n\r\n - Mike

    throught his fonts, but without success. Actually it could be somewhere from these
    lands, because I\xB4m from Slovakia, althought the titles are in german (or Austrian?).\r\nI
    know the font is similar to Serapion http://www.stormtype.com/serap.html , or
    Jannon http://www.stormtype.com/jannon.html or Tyfa http://www.stormtype.com/tyfa.html
    , but the letter \"a\" is different in all three cases.\r\n\r\nMaybe theese original
    samples will help.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/toskanabrot.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/backersonne.jpg]"

    type specimens. This is like a wall we keep running into. My only resource is
    the Jaspert book, and it's just not very current.\r\n\r\nThanks Jan for the added
    samples. That makes this more credible as a font, for sure, but I think we may
    be exposing our weakness in Eastern European type. Maybe Franta would be helpful
    to ask, as Dennis suggested.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
