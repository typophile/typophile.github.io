  architecture is based on the designs of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright\">Frank
  Lloyd Wright.</a> I'm looking for a typeface that can appropriately harmonize or
  allude to his work and organic architecture in general.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse,
  this design is to highlight the wedding and reception services that the hotel (and
  adjacent mansion) facilitate. So a straight up typeface emblematic of Wright's work
  may or may not fit the bill. That said,\r\n\r\nI'm curious of:\r\n\u2022 if anything
  comes to mind immediately, and\r\n\u2022 if you can think of a script typeface that
  still embodies Wright.\r\n\r\nThat last one is a tall order but maybe there's hope.\r\n\r\nThanks
  all!"

  body: James, the first Google link that comes up is to MyFonts, where you can see
    that P22 and Monotype both publish David Siegel's Eaglefeather, a script typeface
    based on Wright's lettering. Isn't that exactly what you were looking for, and
    surely not a "tall order"?

  body: "Bert \u2014 To be fair, we can\u2019t be sure whether the type for <em>The
    House Beautiful</em> was spec\u2019ed by FLW or by his partner in this venture,
    William Herman Winslow, who owned the private press. FLW designed the page schemes
    and ornamentation, obviously. But he may not have been directly involved in the
    composition of the text. And the all-caps was not out of keeping with the small,
    private, vanity press style of the day (ca. 1896\u20137).\r\n\r\nNick \u2014 I
    don\u2019t know that we [I did some of the research on this for DB, including
    those photos] ever positively nailed the type. Without any lowercase, it\u2019s
    a little tricky. But my conclusion was either Custer from Western Type Foundry
    (out of Chicago, near to where this was printed) or Cushing No. 2 from ATF (which
    also had a Chicago office). \r\n\r\nMacGrew states that Custer was a copy of Cushing
    No. 2 (not to be confused with Cushing Oldstyle or Cushing Antique). Both were
    precursors to some of the later Bookman series."

    unpacked my BB&amp;S (successor to Western Type Foundry) specimen books yet, so

    \"typographic\" is not necessarily the thing. \r\n\r\nIf you want it too look
    like Wright's lettering on architectural drawings, then I suppose all caps of
    Eagle Feather will work. \r\n\r\nIf you want hand writing, then the eccentric
    and period Midway may work in giving it a unique flavor. \r\n\r\nThe low contrast
    all caps may be authentic, but they don't say \"Frank Lloyd Wright\" to me.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I don't think Wright's decoration and writing were his strong suit in any case.
    In general it's his awesome interior spaces. For decoration, I much prefer his
