  tombstone for my diploma.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have tips on how to implement\r\nconextually
  glyph substitution for long s?\r\n\r\nId like to have it done automatically but
  there are\r\njust too many exceptions to the rules and im quite\r\nnew to opentype
  programming, so maybe i'd just\r\nstick with including it as a special character
  which\r\ncan be accessed via glyph pallette?\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?\r\n\r\nthanks
  a lot, this forum has already been extremely useful! \r\nhannes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    an old thread on a similar topic</a>.

  body: "Should be a pretty simple OT feature:\r\nMake \"tall s\" the s in your font.
    (Mapped to lowercase s.)\r\nCreate a new glyph using the \"regular s\" and call
    it \"s.alt\".\r\nCreate a class with space, all punctuation, and \"s\".\r\nWhenever
    \"s\" is followed by your class, use \"s.alt\"."

  body: "As explained by Adam (and as we found in our own research), it isn't that
    simple. The correct usage of the long s varies by location and time. Chester's
    code example would work well enough for latter-day English usage of the long s,
    though.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Chester's advice is good. \r\nOr do it the other way round --\r\n\r\nGlyph
    names: \"s\" remains the round/end s and \"longs\" is the long s.\r\nDefine a
    class containing all lowercase (ligatures included), say @LC_for_longs. \r\n\r\nMake
    a \"hist\" feature with a contextual substitution:\r\nsub s' @LC_for_longs by
    longs;\r\n\r\nThis means: Long s replaces normal s only if another lowercase follows.
    Not so if any other letter (uppercase, punctuation & spaces included) follows.
    Same result as with Chester's sample, but it's easier to collect lowercase than
    all possible exceptions (like quotation marks &c).\r\nMoreover, you can also use
    the font without long s. E.g. if the app doesn't support any features.\r\n\r\nWorks
    well for English which has very simple long s rules: always except at the end
    of a word.\r\nFor German, you create a paragraph style with this feature switched
    on, and create a character style with this feature switched off. Then go through
    your text manually to apply the character style to normal s's that should be round/end
    s ...\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: Indeed, my feature is very simple, and is meant to be used for English. Karsten
    is your man for OpenType coding; he takes a great deal of care in making his types
    so that they can be beautifully set in many languages and idioms. Hi Litteratra
    typeface is bursting with alternates, ligatures, contextual alternates and contextual
    positioning options. (He uses Stylistic Sets very well.)

  body: InDesign doesn't support the hist feature by any type of automatic substitution.
    See page 14 of Adobe's <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf">OT
    User's Guide</a> for a list of currently supported features.

  body: "You could do contextual alternates, but that is ON by default, so you have
    to want the feature to be ON unless you specifically turn it OFF. What you should
    do (in any event) is duplicate that hist feature and have the second version as
    \"ss01\": you'll be able to turn the feature ON using InDesign, which supports
    Stylistic Sets. If you also want to use the feature in Illustrator, you might
    consider making it a \"titl\": Titling Alternates.\r\n\r\nIt's annoying that Adobe
    released a generation of products together as Creative Suite 2, but that they
    all have different type handling. I hope that they get their act together in the
    next version and all play nice and adopt the InDesign model.\r\n\r\nFYI, I have
    posted screengrabs of CS2's OpenType \"interfaces\" here:\r\nhttp://vllg.com/files/cs2/"

    said, mirroring unsupported features (ornm is\r\nanother one) in an ssXX helps.\r\n\r\nIf
    it shall work in old ID (non-CS) 2 or other apps too, \r\nyou need to use one
    of the standard features indeed.\r\nID CS2 is the only application so far which
    supports ssXX\r\nfeatures.\r\nWhich one, depends -- \r\nmaybe not liga as you
    type might have ligatures,\r\nmaybe not dlig as your type might have abbreviations,\r\n&c\r\n--
    titling is really a good choice!\r\n\r\nKarsten"
