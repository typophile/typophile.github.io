Anyway, actually I do run a foundry that's not on MyFonts. But that's mostly because I do custom commissions almost exclusively, and little retail work.

Keep in mind that there are some of us who only sell through distributors. This is a business decision that each font maker must make, whether to take on the responsibility of dealing with customers and payments directly or not. I did this for a while, and I liked the direct contact with customers most of the time, but the extra percentage of income from the direct sale of a license was not worth being on-call 25/7 for support issues, which most often were from novice users with installation or download difficulties. I am a one-person operation. I'm happy to pay my distributors for taking this burden from me and leaving me to do what I do best (presumably).

Sorry for going somewhat off-topic, but there seems to be an assumption that distributors are a bad deal for font makers, and that they should be avoided if possible. If MyFonts' "large library and great interface" makes it easy for you to find the fonts you want, don't be a jerk. If font makers don't want you to buy their fonts on MyFonts for some reason, they shouldn't be on MyFonts.</div>

In some cases it's a bad deal, but it's crazy to think it's generally a bad deal, simply because there are many successful type designers who use -and keep using- distributors! Not that I consider myself "successful", but I've been quite happy with Linotype since 1998 and delighted with FontFont since December.

That all depends on whether you consider the amount of work it took to get MyFonts to where they are today. Sell one font on your own at 100% royalty rate, versus, say, ten at 50% (conservative estimate of differing exposure levels!) and it becomes clear that MyFonts is the better option. If you're coming at it from a point of "I spent ages making this font and they just take their cut for doing not very much" then go out on your own. I prefer the "MyFonts get me way more exposure than I could dream of getting on my own and they only charge a small (relative to other distributors) cut for it" way of thinking. Each to their own though, I suppose.</div>

But that's because you're selling less, not because the industry's biggest competitors are taking advantage of your weaker position and helping themselves to a larger chunk of your already tight income. 80% is fair, but 50% isn't. And if one designer is getting a better rate than others, I can see why they wouldn't have complaints.

But for the record, I'm not a type designer. I just think Monotype is using its market dominance and ownership of the channels of commerce to take advantage of its smaller rivals.</div>

The simplest way to earn more money -- a much more cost-effective use of time than developing another font for sale at MyFonts -- would be to organize with other foundries and demand a higher base rate for all designers or else MyFonts will find themselves lacking products to take half the profits of.

		<div class="commentbody">Type designers constitute a very limited pool of talent, and their expert work is very time-consuming. They are therefore difficult to quickly replace, so a strike could be highly effective. Losing distinctive, well-known bestsellers like Museo and Storefront Pro would be especially problematic. People looking for those fonts will just Google them and start buying elsewhere.

Of MyFonts' 50 bestselling fonts, 11 come from itself (Monotype, aka Berthold, Bitstream and Linotype -- and several others that aren't in the top 50), while of the rest, the majority share comes from just 7 sources: Jos Buivenga (exljbris), Hannes von Döhren (HVD), Hubert Jocham, Emily Lime, Ryan Martinson (Yellow Design Studio), Parachute and URW++. I'd imagine Mark Simonson, owner of #1 bestseller Proxima Nova; and Font Bureau, with two entries on the top 50 and a large library; could also wield some influence.

There's also grounds for a DOJ antitrust suit against Monotype, as they are the Walmart (MyFonts), Target (fonts.com), Proctor and Gamble (Monotype), Johnson & Johnson (Linotype) and Unilever (ITC) of their industry, setting the terms by which every smaller manufacturer must sell their wares if they want to be in the world's largest stores.</div>

That's how business works. If you're Monotype, I bet you'll do the same they're doing or they did. It pushes you forward, to become bigger and bigger.

Or look from this side: if you open your grocery shop in your one-way street where you live and sell your fruits only there, will you be satisfied with the traffic of customers same as me, while I sell my fruits in the biggest and well known hypermarkets.

Same relation... why do we need banks then? They are just basically traders, who do export-import for you and take their %.

I'm assuming that's from the current list. If you could aggregate such data over time* then that would actually be quite a useful contribution on your part.

Maybe that's what Jackson is doing.
