    of the regular weight in Mike's guide which I thought resembled the sample artificially
    emboldened, now I see your sample I can see I was on the wrong track. I didn't
    want to download any of the illegal versions floating about to see for myself.\r\nTim\r\n\r\n{edit

  body: Thanks for the help guys. So far Eclat seems like the best alternative for
    my needs, although I'm still kind of hesitant to make the purchase. I went ahead
    and contacted Large, so I'm going to just wait for now. Anymore suggestions are
    welcome!
