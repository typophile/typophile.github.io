  am trying to use some of the glyphs in Zapfino, in particular one of the alternative
  capital D's and some of the decorative dingbats.\r\n\r\nHow do I enter high-bit
  characters into Freehand or even Word?"

    Mac Word have a character palette like the Windows version? If it does, you can
    get at the glyph that way.\r\n\r\nYou can do this is InDesign as well. Or in Illustrator
    CS.\r\n\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Well, that version of Zapfino is an AAT font. Other than Apple products,
    I'm not aware of any that support AAT features!!!\r\n\r\nMacromedia products do
    not support OpenType features, and older versions of MS products don't either.
    If they don't even have OpenType support, I doubt that they'd have AAT\u2026\r\n\r\nZapfino
    can be bought as <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/61924/zapfinoextra-family.html\">four
    single fonts</a> (Zapfino Extra One through Four), but that probably isn't the
    solution you are looking for. I don't know what other solutions you have, unless
    you use Adobe software (or other OpenType support products). Newer Adobe products
    would do this no problem.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
