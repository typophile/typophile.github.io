body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m desperately looking for any high quality examples
  (actually, any examples at all) of Romane, a font developed at Scriptorium de Toulouse
  in 1994 by one S\xE9verine Hameau.\r\n\r\nSo far I\u2019ve seen it mentioned in
  passing a half dozen times and there are a couple of pictures \u2013 one on [[http://www.typofonderie.com/gazette/articles/scriptoriumdetoulouse|Typofonderie]],
  and one on a French [[http://www.culturesfrance.com/adpf-publi/folio/lettres/08.html|cultural
  directory]].\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that it was never committed to metal or digital
  type due to an accident, I can\u2019t help but believe there must be more prints
  of it about \u2013 it won honorary mention for text font in Linotype\u2019s 1st
  International Design Contest, it can't have completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nSo all
  in all I'm after any information at all, and would ideally like some URIs to high-res
  images. I'm completely besotted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBarney"
