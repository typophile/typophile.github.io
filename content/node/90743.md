body: "Hey there!\r\n\r\nI've been trying to find info on the Web regarding the correct
  amount of space (kerning) between uppercase letters (as in a full word set in uppercase).
  I remember my tutor at University saying that 25 in InDesign or 40 units in Quark
  was about right.\r\n\r\nI'm not even sure there is a 'right' amount of space, or
  if it depends on how much text there is (no kerning if it's just one word, plenty
  if it's a full sentence, etc.). Or if it depends on the typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nAntonio"

    is applied between pairs of letters.\r\n\r\nNitpicking aside, I second what Luma
