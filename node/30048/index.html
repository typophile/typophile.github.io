  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&rsquo;ve just gotten a prospectus for this book from Oak Knoll (who are distributors of the book). The authors' own press (Libanus Press) is the imprint. It appears to be a phenomenally complete manual on book typography. 448 pages, 1000 illustrations of concepts and principles, thorough coverage of all topics related to book design including image/text layout, type selection, variables in type specification, and much more. I admit I am very intrigued by this brochure. Has anyone seen the book firsthand?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I picked up a copy directly from the publisher about 9 months ago and must admit it&rsquo;s a bit of an indulgence; there was something about the girth of the thing and the high production values that appealed to my vanity. The book really is nicely put together, and what it does it does very well; that is, it is ultimately pragmatic in its approach.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is that if one has studied one&rsquo;s Bringhurst, with additional readings from, say, Dowdings' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finer Points&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Tschichold&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Art of the Book,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with, say, a few dashes of Felici&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Complete Manual of Typography,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and every self-respecting book typographer should be reading these texts) then, really, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Book Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> won&rsquo;t be as full of useful info as it might be to someone coming in blank.</p>
<p>That said, the book has dedicated chapters on topics not touched by any of the above-mentioned books: basic halftone &amp; 4-colour pre-press, technical details on setting up &amp; designing soft-bound covers &amp; dust jackets, etc. (see below for the TOC). The book also focuses more on the fine details of HOW to accomplish certain typographic principles. Thus, where Bringhurst is perhaps heavier on the theory side, this text is very focused on the practical application; not exactly an application-specific manual, but a fairly clear book typographer&rsquo;s handbook.</p>
<p>One small bug for North American readers is that the (format) dimensions tend to be in metric, rather than imperial (and this coming from a Canadian!); typographic dimensions are, for the most part, in points and picas, but dimensions relating to book/page/sheet size are all metric and/or European (that is, A2, A3, A4 rather than tabloid, legal, letter, etc.).</p>
<p>As I started, the book really is an indulgence, as much (I&rsquo;m guessing) for the authors in producing the book as it is to own. It&rsquo;s lush, beautiful and well built, and it looks good on the shelf. However, when I&rsquo;m looking to confirm a principle, it&rsquo;s still Bringhurst that I reach for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Carl. I saw the same prospectus;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;wonder what they have to say about drop caps in the forthcoming Oak Knoll title Book Typography: A Designer’s Manual? My head of department just forwarded me the info on it. Judging by the contents listing, Mitchell and Wightman give the topic about four pages.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>but I still haven&rsquo;t seen the book itself&hellip; you could say that their prospectus is doing exactly what it it&rsquo;s intended to do; whip up a storm of pre-sales anticipation!</p>
<p>The book itself is at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=92771">http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=92771</a></p>
<p>although I no longer see the downloadable .pdf prospectus there.</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s comment about it being more useful to a complete beginner is probably right on the money. Me, I have no problem with metric page dimensions, so it&rsquo;s good to know that much in advance. I guess I would want to see how it compares against Jost Hochuli &amp; Robin Kinross&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designing books: practice and theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or even Ari Rafaeli&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Book Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also at Oak Knoll.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From the TOC, it looks like what Mitchell and Wightman bring to the table is an integration into the discussion of book design of the nuts and bolts of bookmaking, like getting files and images ready for press, different kinds of bindings and covers, the economics of printing and how that affects book design, etc. (parts 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember seeing those things discussed in Felici, Bringhurst, Hochuli, or Tschichold, and a look at Hendel and Dowding&rsquo;s TOCs tells me they don&rsquo;t address those things in any systematic way, either. Am I missing something? Speaking as an autodidact in the world of book design, this seems like a superb book to have on the shelf.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK Linda, yours for a pint or three whenever!</p>
<p>Maurice makes a good point about the relevance and orderliness of what&rsquo;s integral to the book; although I&rsquo;m delighted to see the (often overlooked) content of Part 16, it occurs to me that one could easily spend more than five pages talking about paper &amp; press in this context in the preceeding Part 15.</p>
<p>Jason, (not a qualitative question I grant you) how many words are they putting on the average page here?</p>
<p>Seriously folks, shipping is shipping; to blame the publisher for how expensive it is to get the goods to your door is to confuse the issue. What&rsquo;s to stop any of you ordering from Oak Knoll? Or did you want it discounted from amazon.com to begin with? If I placed an order tomorrow, I would do so knowing the air freight from the UK to NZ would be prohibitive. I hope this wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with my ability to evaluate the worth of the book itself.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I think I&rsquo;ve stressed above, the book is very well produced: the content is comprehensive, the writing clear and practical, the pages well illustrated &amp; nicely composed, the book finely designed &amp; beautifully printed. Perhaps it&rsquo;s notable that I ordered my copy only after seeing a copy first-hand, perhaps not. I certainly don&rsquo;t think this is simply a matter of being lazy or cheap. It&rsquo;s just that as folks invested &amp; in love with typography &amp; book design I assume that many of us have read extensively on the topic, have gathered a handsome collection of books on the topic along side a stack of others hoarded from the library. The result of this, at least on my part, is a certain disappointment when I shell out a good sum of money for the latest publication only to find that there isn&rsquo;t much in it I wasn&rsquo;t already familiar with. This isn&rsquo;t a complaint about the book, or any book, but about the fact that inevitably books on any given topic become repetitive and, at least to some extent, redundant.</p>
<p>There is also the position which places a certain emphasis on &ldquo;buying locally.&rdquo; This is a somewhat pointless argument in the age of Amazon, and in fact the opposite argument is likely more appropriate: that buying directly from Libanus (as I did) is the only way to get the money to the individual publisher. However, if the information found in a book produced in England can also be found in a book produced in Vancouver&hellip;</p>
