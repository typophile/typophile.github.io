body: I'm researching early twentieth century sans serif faces used to make gravestone
  inscriptions such as in the attached images. Two of the three look nearly identical.
  I'm not looking for a digital incarnation, though if there is a faithful interpretation
  I'd be interested to know about it. The name of a matching specimen or a specimen
  itself would be very helpful.
