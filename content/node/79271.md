body: "Hello, this is my first time crowdsourcing the Typophile community for help
  with ID'ing a font, so I hope you can help me. \r\n\r\nThe type I'm looking for
  was used on a lot of instrument panels in the 1950's and 1960's, (please see photo
  for reference). It has a very antiseptic, technical quality to it, similar to OCR
  B (although I know that's not the one.) \r\n\r\nIf you can hunt this one down or
  other typefaces that have the same feel, I would be most appreciative. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MilgramMachine_4327.jpg]"

  body: Fascinating request - I was just about to ask the same thing! I was in a hospital
    emergency room last night (don't worry, nothing that serious) and I saw the exact
    same etched typeface, with the distinctive /G/ and the clean style. Doubt it's
    been digitized or even existed outside whatever signmaking machine produced these,
    but learning their history would be very interesting.

    nice. Thanks a bunch!
