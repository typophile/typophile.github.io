    some scrutiny, I was disappointed that the Element chart in 43.008 didn&#39;t
    organize the fonts properly. Unless there&#39;s some logic there that I&#39;m
    missing? <BR> <BR>I enjoy the simplicity of 43.019 although I can&#39;t quite
    put my finger on it. <BR> <BR>43.021 seems too phallic for me, personally.  <BR>
    <BR>Why is it that Americans tend to submit shirts with imagery across the chest,
    and typophiles from abroad consistently submit tees with printing along the bottom,
    sides, arms, etc? '

  body: ' Tanya brings up a good point in terms of feasability. 43.001 is astonishing,
    sure -- in fact, easily my favorite so far -- but will cost something like three
    times as much to produce as _ten_ colors printed on a blank  tee shirt. A t-shirt
    with a bleed is called  a &#34;cut &amp; sew&#34; and is printed on separate  material
    and then assembled. Tricky, careful, expensive. Normal tee shirt printing takes  into
    account the cheapness, multiple sizes, and random variation of t-shirt blanks,
    so involves something of a &#34;margin.&#34; <BR> <BR>Which isn&#39;t to say these
    designs with bleeds shouldn&#39;t be considered, but that their production expense
    should be taken into account, and that we should expect Jared and Joe to pass
    that expense on to we, the potential buyers. '
