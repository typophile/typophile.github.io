  informations about foundry, first year of production and artist:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=41\r\n\r\nNow
  we started production of lead lines with a Ludlow and we got 1,2 tons of matrizes.
  I have the scanned character sets and I have a text sample of each font we own.
  But no idea about first year of production and artist.\r\n\r\nShall I show all Ludlow
  fonts we got in a directory of above listet font collection? Would it make sense?
  Or is it easy enough for someone who's interested, to buy a Ludlow specimen?\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eusebius_Open_1_6436.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eusebius_Open_2_6490.jpg]"

    of the 20th Century. \r\n\r\nThis one is Eusebius Open, by Robert Hunter Middleton,
    1929, based on Eusebius, by Middleton's teacher Ernst Detterer, 1923. Eusebius
    is Ludlow's version of Jenson. Lovely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Georg, I'd sure like to see samples of these typefaces. There must be some
    I would like to add as images for my Serif Guide. Will you plan to make samples
    to show on your web site? That would be a fantastic resource, because even though
    McGrew's book may have a list, the images in the book are not printed on high
    quality paper.\r\n\r\nBy the way, we once ID'd Helga (I think that was the typeface
    name), but I never got an image of it that I could use in the Guide. Perhaps you
    could e-mail me about that one?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
