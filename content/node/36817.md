  The students found the exercise challenging \r\nwhich I was happy about since that
  meant they were thinking \r\nabout what they were doing.\r\n\r\nThe exercise was
  based on typographic systems, \r\nexploring composition of space and possibilities
  \r\nof expression (value, rhythm \u2026)\r\nThey had 5 black lines that they used
  to make \r\na composition in a square base on priciples of symmetry, \r\nasymmetry,
  intermittence, interruption.\r\n\r\nMost of the student came up with some good solutions.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any experience in the teaching field. \r\nMaybe you can give me some
  tips about giving the students as much knowledge and experience as possible in a
  3hr class.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\np.S this is an intro to typo class\r\n"

  body: "I taught a level 2 typography class last semester, which was challenging
    but also very rewarding.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the students learned best when
    lectures were kept to a minimum and activity was at a maximum. I kept them busy
    as much as possible so their minds were focused and not bored to death by me explaining
    the differences between a bowl and a counter. I created hand-outs that briefly
    explained things they needed to know, and then let them do their thing. I encouraged
    them to talk and socialize, since design is a social medium.\r\n\r\nAt the end
    of the class, some really began to appreciate typography, and others were just
    happy to make it through to the end. \r\n\r\n+\r\nRyan Ford"

  body: I just finished my design degree, and the memorable and useful projects I
    did in typography classes were about how to utilize hierarchy in design. Which
    is sooooo important. Also I likes the expressive type projects where we got to
    design posters of song lyrics done only in type, and write words in ketchup and
    stuff like that.
