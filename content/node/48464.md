  \ \"Across the Univers\" is a companion design to our first offering \"Helvetica
  Neue Descending a T-shirt\" [[http://typographyshop.com/helvetica_t-shirt.html]]\r\n\r\nClassic
  typeface meets classic tune in our latest offering. A stylistic companion to our
  first offering, Helvetica Neue Descending a t-shirt.  Adrian Frutiger's 1954 masterpiece
  is illustrated in descending weights in two colors.  On sale at the special pre-order
  price of just $19.99 until August 31st.\r\n\r\nMany of our first customers told
  me that they found us on Typophile.  Thanks so much for your support.  The design
  blogosphere embraced the shirt with amazing speed.  It was a blast watching the
  viral spread. I've met some famous designers through it all and the editors of a
  couple of top design magazines are wearing our first shirt.  We're going to have
  some well known designers and industry blogs offering product soon on the site as
  well.  We'll keep you posted as that develops.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acrosstheunivers446_4279.jpg]"
