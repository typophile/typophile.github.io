  for a few weeks. This is for the students study association of the Faculty of Creative
  and Performing Arts. The first logo was horible, so I offerd to change it. Here
  you can see what the current logo is.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kunstenenwetenschappen.nl/index.php3?m=32&c=33&garb=0.1448401879036696&session=\r\n\r\nSomething
  is wrong with the eye and I don't know what. I tried to but the pupil in the middle,
  but that didn't work.\r\n\r\nI have also made a .pdf so you can look how I think
  the logo can work as a letterhead.\r\n\r\nAny help or critique is appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks"

    strokes above and below the eye. I think the heavy strokes are overwhelming the
    eye.

  body: "Although my last <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16248\">post</a> to
    this sort of thread seems to have killed it, I'm going to give this a shot. I
    often say to my students that design should answer questions, not raise them.
    Yet this design leaves me with all kinds of questions. First off, what is the
    actual logo getting at? I mean this very simply; I don't know what you're getting
    at. I know a bit about Dionysus, a bit about Apollo, but I have no idea what the
    vector shapes are trying to tell me. What's the pupil about? Why the left pointing
    triangle? Why a combined shape that resembles a rotated star of David? Why such
    a harsh contrast between the stoke thicknesses? Why centred over the ampersand?
    Question, question, question...\r\n\r\nAlso, Lithos is too easy for the font.
    It's the Copperplate Gothic or Trajan of Greek; both great fonts, but used to
    death for quite a while now.\r\n\r\nAgain, I might be out of the loop, but I just
    don't know what this logo is getting at, and therefore it seems a bit weak."

  body: "Thank you both for the criticism and suggestions.\r\n\r\nMaybe shouldn't
    have used the difference in weight of the strokes.\r\n\r\nI took the greek capital
    letter \u03B1 and \u03B4. I looked for the for a couple of weeks and one of my
    idea's was that when they where combined they look a little like an eye. The \u03B1
    looked more like an eye than the \u03B4. It symbolized looking (for me) at the
    arts.\r\n\r\nThe name of the association was chosen because of the term in art
    history.\r\n\r\nI hoped to avoid a star of david, because it was turned and the
    strokes where of different weights (to draw attention to the \u03B1 and \u03B4).\r\n\r\nI
    chose for Lithos because of the greek connection it has and because it is a playful
    typeface, but can still be used on official documents (the Faculty and the entire
    university use 'minion') and I have a license for it.\r\n\r\nMost of the people
    (I could only test it on 2 , recognized the \u03B1 and \u03B4, but one was a board-member
    and one was the head of communications. So they might have been bias and the first
    person I told about the design of the logo and a few days later he saw it (he
    has a good memory).\r\n\r\nI shall try playing with the weight at first and the
    contemplate if the meaning is clear enough.\r\n\r\nThanks you both for your reaction
    and I will post changes soon.\r\n\r\nI like logo 2. I slimed it down, but i think
    it is still clear wich letters are ment.\r\n\r\nlogo 3 and 4 I have tried to change
    the shape a little to prevent the davidsstar connection."

    and D being the same shape but rotated 90\xB0 and the 'logo' above at 45\xB0"

  body: "<em>Apollo popularly (e.g., in literary criticism) represents harmony, order,
    and reason - characteristics contrasted by those of Dionysus, god of wine, who
    popularly represents emotion and chaos. The contrast between the roles of these
    gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian. However, Greeks
    thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and
    when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea he would leave the Delphi Oracle to
    Dionysus.</em> from Wikipedia\r\nI would suggest that Alpha is always going to
    be confused with A, which would then result in Delta being seen as a triangle.
    I recommend that you either pursue your eye using the lowercase forms, or take
    a different approach, the quote from wikipedia gives a direction you could take
    of contrasting yet complementary areas.\r\nTim"

    the eye. I had a meeting yesterday and the people of the board where rather cryptic
    about what they really thought. But your ideas are quite helpful.\r\n_______\r\n\r\nThanks
    to everyone who has helped me. The definite logo is as is posted above."
