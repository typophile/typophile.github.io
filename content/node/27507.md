body: "I once had a font which I used for the following 'logo' for a magazine called
  LUKSUS. \r\n\r\nI think it was called Chemical and I'm quite sure it was a freebie.
  Somehow I've lost the font and I just can't track it down anywhere. The fonts I
  find when I search for 'chemical' is somehow more techno-ish or what ever you would
  expect fromt that name. So either it gone for good or it has a different name.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know anything about it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/luksus_logo_3992.jpg]"
