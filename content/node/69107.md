    step\r\n4. Save vfb in the created folder\r\n5. Close vfb\r\n6. Copy the folder
    and give it a meaningful name\r\n7. Open the vfb contained in the copied folder\r\n8.
    Do the next step\r\n\r\nThen you have not only a protocol in the end, but backup
    files in the most cases. And even if you have 1000 folders in the end, disc space
    is not expensive.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I actually cannot help. But maybe the FontLab
    people can help, if you send your vfb to them."
