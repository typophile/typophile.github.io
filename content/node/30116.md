  what you guys thought.  I want it to be fun but not too crazy.

  body: Are you deliberately making some of the characters look like they are drawn
    backwards? If not, you may want to give that <strong>w</strong> a horizontal flip...
    it looks too much like a rotated <strong>m</strong>.

  body: I kinda like it. How would it be used? Ricardo is right about that w.

  body: "I'm loving the lighter weight; I could see using it in a warm, humorous piece.
    Very latter twentieth-century, east-coast sort of feeling.\r\n\r\nAnd that w is
    freaky."

  body: We'll I've tweaked it a bit- fixed the w and added a bit more quirkyness.  The
    caps aren't looking so great on their own but look good when used along with lowercase.

  body: In my opinion caps need to be a little more stronger. At the moment they look
    thiner than the lowercase characters

  body: Cute. I think a lot of the issues with your typeface will work themselves
    out the further you'll get in development. Nice work.

    happy with how its turning out.  I still need to fix some kerning issues and add
    more glyphs but its coming along nicely :)'

  body: "Yeah. Give that 'i' some air!\r\n\r\nWhat about some scripting for swapping
    out one g for another ( and so on) . Or to eliminate the same latter looking identical.
    Like that double l in 'Will'. It's like the music stopped. :-(\r\n\r\nMaybe scripting
    for Contextual alteration for 2nd & 3rd duplicate letters is what's needed. Now
    that would be Super Sweet! \r\n\r\nI like your 'n' But your should be more different
    from it I think. I am not loving the 'r'. Maybe pitch the arm higher and start
    it lower."

  body: Eben- how would I go about scripting some alternate letters?  I'm using fontographer
    is thats a hinderance

  body: That might well be a hinderance. I am not sure. If it is you could partner
    with somebody I suppose. Or maybe ( I am crossing my fingers for ya here) if a
    foundry picks it up they could handle it. BTW the old fontopgrapher or the new
    one re-released by fontlab? In any event, the thing to do is to take as far as
    you can before you take that step. If you get utterly stuck & want to do it I
    might be able to help.

    Tchichold, give to him the same value of letter i. It works graceful"
