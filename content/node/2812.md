  body: In simplest terms, typography is design with type. <BR> <BR>However, I think
    the value of typography is best appreciated in relation to text, so my working
    definition is &#39;Typography is the application of design to the articulation
    of text&#39;.

    is an image made from type <BR> <BR>Some people would add an adjectival qualifier
    &#34;artistic&#34; or &#34;pleasing&#34;, to differentiate Typography from mere
    typesetting. But this muddles the definition, because such value judgements are
    subjective: one person&#39;s typography is another&#39;s typesetting, and vice
    versa. <BR> <BR>And this is what John has done with the concept of &#34;design&#34;.
    Who is to say whether a piece of typography has been designed? -- unless of course
    all typesetting is designed, because &#34;you cannot not design&#34;. <BR> <BR>Consider
    the typography you are now reading. In a sense, I am the designer, but so is the
    site designer, and also the end user who stipulates browser preferences: we all
    have some say in the determination of typographic variables such as font, size,
    paragraph leading, punctuation style, even aliasing. On the Internet: the Post-modernity
    of multiple authorship.'

  body: 'Nick, I don&#39;t think the word design constitutes a &#39;value judgement&#39;.
    Design is an activity, or more accurately a collection of activities, and in my
    understanding this includes what might be termed micro-typographic aspects of
    &#39;mere typesetting&#39; such as the decision about how much space to put on
    between a letter and a following punctuation mark. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not keen on
    your term &#39;image&#39;, because it seems to overemphasise the whole to the
    detriment of a proper consideration of the parts. Again, this is not about value
    judgement, but whether one focuses on the product of typography as a key to its
    definition, or on the process of typography. Probably both approaches are valid.
    <BR> <BR>The idea of &#39;articulation of text&#39;, which is central to my working
    definition, does imply a value judgement, because it suggests a measure of the
    success of any piece of typography -- or act of typography, if I were really to
    stress the process -- relative to a text. This is why it is a <i>working</i> definition,
    and different from my simpler definition: design with type. The working definition
    tells you something about the kind of work I do.'

  body: John, I agree with you that the word design does not literally constitute
    a value judgement. However, in practice much professional typography, especially
    at the high end, is done by &#40;graphic&#41; designers. So to use the term &#34;design&#34;
    in a definition is problematic -- it suggests that there is some aspect of professionalism
    involved, when that is not a prerequisite to making typography. <BR> <BR>I can
    see what you&#39;re getting at with &#34;articulation&#34;, but it&#39;s surely
    necessary to include the word &#34;image&#34;, because as it stands, your definition
    could equally apply to &#34;text to sound&#34;. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Generally, when I say text I mean something written. The idea of &#39;oral
    text&#39; is problematic in this regard, but can be ignored unless specifically
    talking about oral literature. I don&#39;t have much time for the more extreme
    post-modern thesis that anything can be regarded as a text, not least because
    it imposes an ideological primacy of writing that I think is wrong. <BR> <BR>However,
    in the interest of seeking a genuine synthesis of our ideas, I&#39;d happily include
    the word &#39;visual&#39; in my definition, e.g. &#39;The application of design
    to the visual articulation of text&#39;. Or, to simplify further, and remove that
    word design which is troubling you, one could forumulate a working definition
    of typography simply as &#39;the visual articulation of text&#39;. <BR> <BR>I
    dislike the term &#39;image&#39; because it suggests a visual whole which is presented
    &#39;all at once&#39; -- as a painting or a photograph -- and not a text, which
    is a thing that you move through temporally. The image of typography is its most
    superficial aspect. I also think there is a tyranny of the image in much contemporary
    design, especially in North America, and a corresponding lack of regard for text.
    This is evident from the pages of &#39;typography&#39; annuals, in which one sees
    few examples of type that is not sitting on top of or adjacent to a photograph,
    illustration, or other image, and usually subservient to it. This attitude has
    its ideological expression in Bruce Mau&#39;s statement &#39;Heaven is a place
    without text&#39;. Wanker. <BR>

  body: 'As I mentioned, &#39;articulation of text&#39; is a <i>working</i> definition,
    which doesn&#39;t claim to be exhaustive. I think it is appropriate to the majority
    of typographic work, and certainly to the kind that most interests me, but there
    are of course uses of type in which text is secondary to the overall image or,
    less often, in which text is not a factor at all. To encompass all this, a more
    general definition is necessary. <BR> <BR>As regards a definition of type, I think
    you would need to include the prefabricated and reusable nature of type that distinguishes
    it from chirography and other unique, manual expressions of written forms. At
    TypeCon last year, Allan Haley gave a talk on what he called &#39;non-font typography&#39;,
    by which he meant hand-lettering in a graphic design context. He showed some nice
    work by various people, but his terminology was a mess of misconceptions: hand-lettering
    is not typography, non-font or otherwise.'

  body: 'I&#39;m going to chime in with a question and a definition. <BR> <BR>Roy,
    did you mean: what&#39;s the literal definition of typography, stated as succinctly
    as possible? Or more of a &#39;What typography means to me&#39; kind of a situation?
    Although, I suppose you can&#39;t really state them separately, as you&#39;ve
    seen so far. <BR> <BR>At its most basic, I&#39;d call it &#39;<i>the consideration
    and/ or appearance of typeset matter</i>&#39;. I mean, it&#39;s all there in the
    name. When I say &#39;appearance and/ or consideration&#39;, I&#39;m hitting on
    design&#39;s potential presence, but design is such a loaded word, I&#39;d be
    inclined towards a more neutral term, that also carries no value judgements &#40;sorry,
    John&#41;, because I believe that design implies intent. With modern &#39;typesetting&#39;
    being so automated, much of the process for amateurs contains no intent, but contains
    many defaults. Also, I&#39;m including the action and the thing itself. Typography
    can be good and bad, as in: &#34;Man, that typography sucks,&#34; which is not
    the action, but the result of it. Typography exists when type is present, but
    design exists only when it is exercised &#40;I know, this is debatable, but I&#39;m
    sticking to it for now.&#41;. <BR> <BR>But that basic definition can be taken
    as very inclusive or exclusive, depending on your opinions about: the role of
    the typesetter/ typographer vs. the role of the graphic designer &#40;or, typography
    vs. design&#41;. <BR> <BR>I can look at a poster that uses type as a purely visual
    element &#40;you might call it a typographic element&#41;, but that does not,
    in my mind, represent the result of typesetting &#40;typography&#41;. It&#39;s
    a typographic design, and in the sense that typographic elements exist there,
    but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s typography as a manifestation of typesetting. See
    the problem? Type isn&#39;t only geometry, it&#39;s a set of symbolic glyphs.
    But, those glyphs only get meaning based on how they&#39;re treated. That&#39;s
    what makes &#40;in my mind&#41; the definition so potentially contentious. The
    intent of the typesetter/ designer/ artist and the end result affect the meaning
    of how typographic elements function in an individual situation, and whether it
    is typography or typographic. <BR> <BR>I think. ...I&#39;m starting to twist my
    thoughts a little too hard, but I believe this is a conceptually consistent post.
    But what better place to have this discussion than with Typophiles? <BR> <BR><IMG
