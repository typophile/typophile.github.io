body: The <a href="http://www.typophile.com/needs/your/support/application.html">membership</a>
  page still is set for 2004 membership. Are any changes planned for 2005, or should
  I just go ahead and join, pretending that 2004 reads 2005? <BR> <BR>&#40;Now we&#39;ll
  see if history repeats itself. The last two times I was ready to get an Uppercase
  account, the board went down!&#41;

  body: Steve, you definitely are the jinx... =&#41; <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t expect
    to change the membership benefits during  <BR>2005. We are however, cranking on
    major site updates in  <BR>time for our 5th anniversary. <BR> <BR>Priority one
    is moving over to our new server environment for  <BR>better stability. Priority
    two is the forum software itself.  <BR>Membership contributions will definitely
    help fund these needed <BR>upgrades.

  body: I think it&#39;s fairly clear that I should just be given an Uppercase account
    so that I will never again have to think about joining, which is what seems to
    cause all of this. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>No, seriously, I&#39;ll join.

  body: mike, <BR> <BR>I just joined a few months ago. It did take some time - more
    than the membership page says. I sent a few emails and it got sorted out. <BR>
    <BR>I did get access and my shirts arrived. <BR> <BR>I got the feeling that the
    guys that run the site have their hands full and they just did not get a chance
    to set me up and send the stuff out. <BR> <BR>So, I am certain you will get upgraded,
    but can&#39;t tell you when. <BR> <BR>Glad you joined - the support is important
    for sites/resources like Typophile. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>Mike

    the payoff is worth it. My membership and goodies took quite a while to kick in,
    too. <BR> <BR>Anyway, we all appreciate your UC contribution.
