body: ' I&#39;ve recently been approached by somebody who does not want a custom font
  but custom lettered titles. I have no idea how many titles or how long the titles
  wil be. <BR> <BR>The font doesn&#39;t exist, and I&#39;m not sure if they have a
  specific lettering style in mind so it&#39;s totally from scratch. <BR> <BR>They
  want a quote and I&#39;m not sure how to quote this. Initially I was thinking per
  letter but duplicates would cost 1/2 as much since I&#39;ve already created them.
  <BR> <BR>So, the word - &#34;Wood&#34; would be 3 letters and 1 1/2 price letter.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if $50 per letter is reasonable, $25? I&#39;m just fishing
  more than anything. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

    amounts to that. <BR>2. In lettering various &#34;glyphs&#34; of a letter don&#39;t
    have to be the same, and often making them different is the point; so keep it
    simple and charge per letter. <BR> <BR>But the above is assuming they can&#39;t
    just tell you the total amount of work in advance. Why would this be the case?
