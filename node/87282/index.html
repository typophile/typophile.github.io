I'm starting a thread about bygone quirks in book design. 

When I say quirks I mean things like endpapers, a note on the typeface at the back of the book, vignettes for each chapter opener, the first word of the next page at the bottom of the current page etc etc. 

Can anyone think of some others? </div>

However, I wouldn’t call that a quirk, as it served a purpose.

**

Reference symbols have been largely replaced by numbers.
Again, I wouldn’t call them a quirk—they were a practical way for printers to make reference calls by means of characters doing double duty—without recourse to a special sort of superior figures or packing a smaller size figure.

Similarly:

Roman figures in italic text.
Old-style figures in all small caps.

**

I would say that “dumb” quotes and faux italic/bold have become (not so nice) old-fashioned quirks, relics of the early days of DTP.
Perhaps they will acquire a quaint cachet in time.

**

A new quirk is how “smart” layout apps abbreviate numbers incorrectly, with a single left quote mark.

Also, and still from wildly different periods:

Double-em dashes for interruptions: "But I think——"

And for anonymity: Mr. K—— (still see this sometimes)

Periods after headings

Double space between sentences

Roman caps with italic lc

Tables where the vertical rules stop to let the horizontal ones through, or vice versa

Of course, if you're in England, lots of current American punctuation looks like a charming old fashioned idiosyncrasy: Mr. (instead of British Mr), 1,000 (instead of British 1 000 or 1000), etc.

Two bits that intrigue me: 

'Turnover lines brought up or down, and set flush right with one left parenthesis or bracket (still see this sometimes)' – I can't imagine what this looks like… can you explain? 

'Color Plates/Tip Ins' – what are these?</div>

I used to see this in old dictionaries a lot, to save space. Something like this:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Document1_4345.jpg]
...where there's three-quarters of a line of empty space after the entry for "turnout...", while the entry for "turnpike..." only wraps to a second line by a short distance, so they turn it <em>up</em> (and right-align it) instead of down, and indicate it with a bracket.

Yes, that describes color plates — a separate signature of color printing gathered and bound together as a section in an otherwise one-color book (or sometimes two-color: I’ve done that before). 

“Tip-in” usually refers to a color illustration/photo that has been printed by a separate process and then affixed onto a blank page set aside for the purpose in an otherwise one-color book.

Color plates are still common in certain genres. Tip-ins, however, require hand work and so are almost never seen these days.</div>

Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Never seen it in a dictionary, but you still see it (rarely) in poetry and plays. Here, from the very first edition of A Midſomer nights Dreame:

http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/media/facsimile/F1s/MNDF1s/MNDF1_0170s.jpg

On the upper right, "bryer" (briar) is turned over this way.

It's maybe more interesting to note, however, when they don't do it.

An unusual example that comes to mind is the 1997 coffee-table book "From Myst to Riven" (about the making of those computers games). The central graphic on the cover was glued in place after the cover was printed, so they could offer your choice of 5 different cover images.

Aren't these one and the same thing?

I do like the theatrical sense of anticipation created by, say, dark coloured endpapers --> half-title --> title page on first encountering a book. I gather the half-title originated as a way to identify and protect the book in the bindery, is this right?

Not exactly. First proper spacing between sentences was
killed by monospaced fonts (a mechanical compromise
in typewriters) which have spacing so loose that the single
space after a period gets lost, so you put two spaces. Then
desktop publishing killed (or demoted 99%) monospaced
fonts, but some people stayed dead inside and they still
use two spaces.

		<div class="commentbody">The kerning-killed-double-spacing theory:

Without kerning, many words that begin sentences (in mixed case, of course) have a large gap between the capital and the lowercase letter immediately after. The culprits are most notably T, V, W and Y followed by a vowel. Double spacing avoided the effect of said capitals appearing to be evenly isolated between the end of the previous sentence and the rest of their word.

Typewriters had nothing to do with it, as the practice was widespread before their invention.

The demise of double spacing began with Linotype’s two letter logotypes for the problem capital-vowel combinations.</div>

Reference?
Note BTW that in metal composition you don't "double"
a space after a period - you just choose a spacing sort of
a functional width.

Perhaps more so than the kerning issue, the variation in justification accounts for extra sentence spacing—otherwise sentence spacing in a tight line would be way less than word spacing in an open line, which gives the wrong hierarchical impression of how text is organized into paragraph/sentence/words.

No, a quick look at three <1870 samples from Google Books suggests it was general practice: 3-for-3 have "double" spaces between sentences.

going to insert extra spaces to justify a line, the first place
to do it is after a period. This has nothing to do with kerning.

There can be more than one reason to put extra space after a
period, and the looseness of fixed-width fonts could have been
one of the more compelling ones.

I agree, however, that was not always the case.
In the early days printers would often omit space after a period or comma, which is not without its own logic.
So when and where did the practice begin?</div>

Clearly that's true. But I think the kerning fallout
you suggested was even less often the case (if ever).

[Explanation: if one used an em for a space after a full stop, that would be one wordspace less to justify (eg the distribution of the rest space in a line over all wordspaces) — it would look okay-ish & be a bit quicker to do.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the Monotype machine, Tolbert Lanston initially implemented a justification system that applied even spacing between all characters. However, nobody liked it and it was never put into production, they were happier with the familiar practice of justifying by adding to word spacing. It seems they were comfortable with the integrity and consistency of words in fixed-width fonts, and not bothered by wild variation in word spacing.

However, when Quark XPress launched with justification-by-character spacing as default, there was no comment. By that time it seems that variability of letterspace and evenness of overall “fit”, as effected by kerning, was preferred.

A somewhat different kerning effect than I had originally proposed (although I still think that plays a part). As Hrant says, it’s something to do with “the looseness of fixed width fonts”, but I would modify that to “openness” or “spaceyness”, because of the consistency of glyph fitting, which was precise and very tight in many combinations.

I'm pretty sure the Monotype didn't use fixed-width fonts.
