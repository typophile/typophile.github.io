  once finished.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27863.jpg" alt="">

  body: I looks a little bit [too much] like Keedy Sans. <BR> <BR>BTW, are Kristin,
    Steve, Lisa, Carrie, Austin, etc. maybe all the same person? :-/ <BR>Or did some
    typography teacher send a whole class over here or something? <BR>Don&#39;t get
    me wrong you&#39;re [all] welcome - it&#39;s just a bit... uncommon. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hello, Kristin. Are we to understand that this isn&#39;t your typeface, simply
    the jumping off point?

  body: I am creating two typefaces. The first one is posed above and it will be used
    as a base font for creating the second one. This typeface is needed to determine
    the proportions and the shape of my second typeface. Here is a sample of what
    my second typeface will look like, but it is still in progress. I will post it
    when finished. Comments and criticism on the first font and the beginning of my
    second one would be greatly appeciated. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27960.jpg"

  body: 'Kristin, this second one is more interesting. The first, as has been mentioned
    is rather close to Keedy Sans. There is nothing wrong, in my opinion, from referencing
    a font for proportions. But, perhaps you could post the rest of this second alphabet. '

  body: To answer all the Typophiles question, there are alot of people posting from
    our class.  Since some of you are influencing the idea of type itoday why not
    get some of the most insightful minds critiqing some potential typographers. <BR>
    <BR>I second the Keedy Sans comment.  It looks very similar, but the question
    I ask is why you showed the &#34;base&#34; type first, when you said your using
    the type as a proportional tool.  Your inkblot look nothing like Keedy Sans or
    your base face, so there should not be a reason to give them more than a promience
    of inspiration.   <BR> <BR>You can work with them together say like the Twin typeface
    by Letterror.

    as a formal educational tool - super. <BR> <BR>BTW, it seems like your teacher
    &#40;is it Josh?&#41; has a strong -and positive- influence on you all, like in
    the way many of you are working on &#34;layers&#34; of form and such. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: For some people it is harder to grasp than others.  Our professor put forth
    a fairly straight forward assignment and though it seemed foreign to many at first,
    I think everyone is coming around.  They have to begin to understand that design
    is some you think about. Not just a colorful scarf you put on to add a splash
    of color. <BR> <BR>Also our professor is talking with Jared and I think many of
    our final posts will be moved to a new forum or special link within Typophile.
    <BR> <BR>Appreciate all the comments from all of you also. <BR> <BR>jp

  body: 'Hey Kristin- It&#39;s been awhile since i&#39;ve seen this typeface and it
    looks really sweet now. I was a bit skeptical of the rorshack &#40;whatever&#41;
    attempt so this comes as a great surprise. You&#39;d never know those were from
    illustrator. One question: Did you have an action built into your typeface, like
    something that affected it from stage to stage? I can&#39;t remember.  <BR> <BR>Rock
    on,  <BR> <BR>-Mitch'
