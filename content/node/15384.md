body: "I've got a design job to do, and I'm looking for a very high quality script
  font, perhaps in the same spirit as Zapfino (if that qualifies as a script font,
  forgive my misuse of the lingo.) Something that would be appropriate for a diploma
  or academic certificate of sorts, but the more elegant and elaborate, the better.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  some of you would be kind enough to throw out a few names. Cost is not an issue
  at this point.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "If you like Zapfino, you should try Zapfino Extra LT Pro, an expanded version
    of Zapfino: \r\nhttp://www.linotypefont.com/8-36-8-17885/zapfinoextra.html\r\n\r\nIt
    includes a load of OpemType contextual features that produce a lively script impression
    by automatically switching between different alternates in an intelligent manner.
    If you type the same word twice, you will get two different renderings! This works
    in all applications that support OpenType contextual features, e.g. Adobe InDesign,
    Adobe Photoshop CS/CS2, Adobe Illustrator CS/CS2. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam"
