    from small foundries who have placed ads in major magazines, like Eye and Step.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    by a foundry?

  body: "hey man - they are all on typecon! ;-)\r\n\r\nI can say, all my marketing
    is made through my web site. But if you understand marketing in a wider range,
    its goes beyond physical (visual) things. Its good to have some friends and colleagues
    in the scene. They can make a note on the right spot, a review or just use your
    work. But all this needs time and passion. You have to be present on some point
    and the things will happen. Maybe not the fastest way.\r\n\r\nClassic ads for
    type faces I have seen last in magazines from the late 50ths. In a time type faces
    costs real money. Will it work today? Maybe, if you have the new Futura it could
    be worth. \r\n\r\nToday many small foundrys made their own stuff - books, magazines,
    posters and the little goodies. Don't know if this realy helps selling the fonts,
    but it spreads the word and its worth a news. - So hopefully they get their adverts
    in a form of an nice article for \"free\".\r\n\r\nI expect to see more and more
    cooperations of independent designers like The Village (www.vllg.com) in the near
    future, so they can bundle their strengthens.\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

  body: "Most foundries have a submission process. I'd find a foundry that seems to
    fit with your work and create a list of foundries you want to solicit. They usual
    have a submission process they want you to follow. Some are okay reviewing semi-completed
    work, others want final fonts.\r\n\r\nStarting your own retail operation takes
    a lot more work, and involves order fulfillment and tech support for your fonts
    that lots of designers avoid by going through a foundry. "
