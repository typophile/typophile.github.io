  body: "wow, that was fast! Thanks, I should have caught that it was done by hand.\r\n\r\nSC
    Elsewhere? hmmm\r\n\r\nI guess I'll pose another question in this thread just
    to keep it simple... \r\n\r\nWhat is the most authentic route to go when doing
    this style of lettering? Is this Celtic in origin?\r\n\r\nty,\r\nJC"

    with the book's bonus CD. I'd love to include a picture but although I have studied
    the forum's guidelines I seem not to be able to upload it - the appropriate box
    does not show on my browser.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the font's home is moorstation.org/typoasis"
