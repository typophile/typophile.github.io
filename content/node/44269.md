body: 'I use Font Bureau''s Californian Text for a magazine. It''s a Type 1 font and
  the roman face has only lining figures. We purchased the expert font as well. How
  does one best put an expert font to use? Ive never used one and I''ve always been
  curious. I work in InDesign and I''m considering talking to my art director about
  using text figures in place of lining figures from this point forward. I know I
  can do a Find/Change and replace all digits with a Character Style set to use the
  expert font which includes text figures. Is this the best way to go about it in
  this case? '

  body: You could also contact Font Bureau. I heard a rumor that they have (are) updated
    (ing) all of their fonts to OpenType. It would be far easier to implement the
    use of the old style figures if they didn't have to be used through find and replace.

  body: "Thanks, Tiffany. Dyana at The Font Bureau just messaged me about the OpenType
    options. \r\n\r\nI realized I sounded like such a newjack in my first post. I've
    used expert fonts before, just not to this scale\u2014replacing all figures in
    an entire magazine. Ok, I've redeemed myself. "
