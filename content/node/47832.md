  body: Maybe it might work better if you played up a flourish with the ampersand,
    not the R? Perhaps the ampersand has more of a calligraphic feel to it, you know,
    to kind of reinforce the "hands-on" concierge notion.

    noticed that too and was initially bothered by that. After continuing doing logo
    roughs I noticed that unless there is a very obvious graphic device that says
    \"travel company\" the name will always invoke that lawyer/accountant aesthetic.
    I suppose a lot of the descriptive elements about the nature of the company will
    be communicated through the implementation. By <em>slick</em> I mean minimal graphic
    styling with careful consideration of the chosen copy, stock and finished techniques
    with a strong emphasis on high quality (descriptive) photography. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I should include a tagline at this stage to help?\r\n"

    As mentioned above the name itself does carry a stigma of law-firm, etc so I'm
    not that worried about that at the moment. I will take your advice on colour and
    post up some colour variations soon.\r\n\r\nThe swash <em>r</em> at the beginning
    had a countering swash coming from the stroke on the <em>d</em> which I took out
    because I felt it wasn't working. Below is a sample of it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_1_3631.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    will take your point on the weight irregularities (this was my main reason for
    posting here) as I am fairly new to designing type I couldn't quite pick out what
    it was. I work with two other colleagues on identity work, we each present our
    own unique ideas to the client and this was my idea. The two others use graphic
    elements so I thought I'd try using solely type.\r\n\r\n"

    you might be able to create a complementary shortened version of the logo that

    the logo together when the E and W are kerned more tightly to the ampersand. \r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I do also like the elongated R on the original version. It made me
    immediately think of the logo for [[http://www.underconsideration.com/|UnderConsideration]].\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "@ Wesley \u2014 Thanks for your comments I have taken you point on the kerning
    between certain characters, however, I have done several versions using combined
    letterforms to no avail. Joining the \u2018W\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 creates unusual
    emphasis on that character combination which is not something I want to point
    out. Due the the quite chunky serifs the space where the letters join looks crowded
    and I would have to counter that by tracking the rest of the letters closer together
    which I feel is going in the wrong direction. \r\n\r\n@schrockwell \u2014 I have
    looked at the shortened version before and felt that the company is relatively
    new and shortening the name will further mask the actual name of the company.
    It's not something I'm ruling out though. Using this version the swash on the
    ampersand also creates unusual prominence to the \u2018W\u2019 while alienating
    the \u2018E\u2019. In general, as a rule, I'm trying not to kern everything close
    together. As substantial as the letters are, I want to keep a lightness to them
    also.\r\n\r\nAs always appreciate the comments. Thanks"

    something like this: extend the swash on the ampersand a bit lower so that you
    can curve it back on itself; then loop it back to merge with a swashed R. Make
    sense? I think that could really help tie it all up. Then again, it might make
    for an obscenely long swash on the R...still perhaps worth a shot, though. If
    the lines thin out at in the middle of the swash ligature, that could help...\r\n\r\nNice
