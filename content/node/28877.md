  alphabet close to this one.  This is from the book \"Design Humor\".  There is no
  annotation to indicate where they got it from.  At first I was going to trace this
  but I have no idea how to even start.  \r\n\r\nIs there anything like this out there
  in font land?\r\n\r\n"

    humour though.\r\nTim"
