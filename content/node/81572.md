  and \"Sears, Roebuck\" letters are altered so they curve, but does does anyone know
  what fonts are used here? I'm guessing 3-4 different ones. I'm trying to make a
  similiar design for my buddy's band, but can't find fonts that match perfectly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/supertone9070_6673.jpg]"

  body: This goes back to the time when you couldn't modify fonts as easily as you
    can now (they were solid pieces of metal!). The only type here is the informational
    text below the hole. Everything else was hand drawn. The best you could do is
    find fonts that look similar to the lettering. "SUPERTONE" is similar to <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-SbtiXu">Globe
    Gothic</a>. The line below that is similar to <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-l1oBkJ">ITC
    Juanita</a>. The line at the bottom may have been based on <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-2eFKZt">Cooper
    Black</a>.

  body: Wow I never would have thought the whole thing was hand drawn! That would
    explain some of the uneveness of the designs though. Thanks for the suggestions.
    You helped me out a lot.
