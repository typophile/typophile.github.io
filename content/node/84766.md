body: "I am requiring all of my introduction to graphic design students to research
  a designer and his/her work within a specific practice area of design, write a 1,000-word
  essay about the designer, and develop the essay into a presentation. The designers
  I chose were picked primarily because it would be easy for students to research
  in a library as opposed to online. I ended up with a list that is mostly white Americans
  and I would like to add some diversity. \r\n\r\nAlso, I still have not come up with
  a great interface designer for my list. Suggestions there would be especially helpful.\r\n\r\nFollowing
  is my list of designers and practice ares. Please suggest alternate designers and
  any practice areas that I have neglected. The most important criteria is that the
  designer has been written about in commonly-available, English language, books and
  magazines. This is not a research and writing class, so I do not have time to guide
  \r\nstudents through interviews, translations, locating limited edition books, etc..\r\n\r\nKenya
  Hara, art direction\r\nRoger Black, publication design\r\nAlejandro Paul, type design\r\nKyle
  Cooper, film title design\r\nJason Santa Maria, web design\r\nDebbie Millman, identity
  and branding\r\nMatteo Bologna, packaging\r\nJessica Hische, lettering\r\nJonathan
  Ives, product design\r\nPaula Scher, environmental design\r\n?, interface design\r\nNicholas
  Feltron, information design"

    "Ives," for the product designer (but why a product designer in a graphic design
    course?)

    still make libraries?\r\n\r\nI notice the list is (mostly) contemporary folks.
    Intentional? If not, there's probably some historical figures that could be added:
    Tufte, Rand, Carson, Glaser, Sagmeister, etc. \r\n\r\nAnd other areas to explore:\r\nmotion
    graphics\r\nuser experience designers\r\nillustrators\r\neditorial design\r\nsignage/wayfinding\r\n\r\nFor
    UI, Susan Kare is a fun one given her creating the early Mac OS icons. John Maeda
    could be another one (less UI and more experimental, but still fun). \r\n"

  body: Sorry, I should have already mentioned this, but the list is supposed to focus
    on living, working, contemporary designers. Some (and sometimes all) of my students
    are not design majors and will never work in design, so the goal is as much to
    teach non-designers about the design field as it exists as it is to teach design
    students about their own field.

    There are only a few books available that concern him, and I have my doubts about
    them being in regular circulation.\r\n\r\nContemporary doesn't equate well with
    library."

  body: "I would suggest Dieter Rams instead of Jonathan Ive, for a variety of reasons.
    Also, \"product design\" is a somewhat muddy term. I think even software developers
    use it. I would use the term \"industrial design\" to be more specific about that
    practice area.\r\n\r\nMaybe Michael Beirut for identity and branding."
