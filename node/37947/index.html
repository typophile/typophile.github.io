  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For some reason, every time I open FontExplorer X - or restart my computer - it takes me through the setup assistant all over again. Furthermore I no longer have my sets, which took me hours to set up. It also no longer starts up automatically, nor does it load my fonts when I open a file (I now have to do this manually).</p>
<p>I tried re-downloading the software and re-installing it, but the problem persists. I&rsquo;ve emailed Linotype but not heard back. Has anybody else had this problem? Or any suggestions? If this persists I may have to try another font management software, which is a shame because I really like FontExplorer.</p>

<p>Patty, once you get your font installed you can make a back-up, albeit a little slow, by dragging the sets out onto the desktop. This makes .ZIP files which you can organize and save for later.</p>

<p>I think all the font managers do this now (they used to give you the option to NOT do it)&hellip; it&rsquo;s primarily for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Speed &ndash; if they know where the fonts are and how they&rsquo;re organized, it&rsquo;s faster to find/load &lsquo;em</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety &ndash; By making copies of fonts, they aren&rsquo;t going to corrupt your originals; every time your system cashes for some reason, there&rsquo;s a chance of corrupting any open font files.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve slowly sorted all my fonts into folders based on my stylistic designations. I then use FontExplorer&rsquo;s smart sets to create sets based on the path to the font. it has been working very well for me, and I have a nicely organized backup of all my fonts.</p>
<p>as for Suitcase, I dumped it myself. I had nothing but trouble in both QXP and InD with it. the primary problem I&rsquo;ve noticed was auto-activation, but even without it I experienced much more frequent crashes in InD. I prefer to manually activate things any way so I know what&rsquo;s going on when I open a doc.</p>

Also, FEX offers the possibility to export/backup the current setup and later to re-import those, see Files &gt; Configurations &gt; Load/Save. This might also be good to know when (or even better: before!) doing major changes in FEX setup.

<p>Thanks to the advice I received on this forum, I tried Font Explorer. What a mess. It took hours to get my computer back to normal. It placed things in my System folder that knocked out the majority of my programs. I had to reinstall everything.</p>
<p>I am happy I&rsquo;m back on Suitcase. I have a few problems with it - but nothing I can&rsquo;t handle in less than 1 minute of my time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m with Ricardo on the switching to Suitcase&hellip;but must add another quick point.</p>
<p>I installed FEX (WinXP Pro), decided it wasn&rsquo;t for me and resolved to remain with Suitcase despite a few issues I have with it.</p>
<p>Uninstalling FEX trashed the majority of older programs on the system (seemingly random fonts for apps making them all but unusable). After much hair tearing (and I don&rsquo;t have much anyway) and silence on Linotype&rsquo;s behalf, a last ditch attempt to rebuild this (system restore failed) was to change my visual theme. Reboot, then change it back to what it was. Amazingly this &ldquo;so obvious you&rsquo;d miss it&rdquo; idea worked.</p>
<p>My personal experience of FEX - on XP at least - is that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be quite ready yet. Maybe a reminder to try again in a few months or so.. ;)</p>
