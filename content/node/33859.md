    impression on the left top of the t - that would be even more adorable. The s
    Seems to be the most sober character and it stand s of slighly. It's nice - don't
    get me wrong, I am just not sure it fits 100% with the others. The f is my favorite.
    It is super duper."

  body: "Yes, The 's' could have a bit more weight to fit. And you could peel off
    a little weight in some of the other glyphs to give them just a little more expression.
    Not lots; but just enough to help the letters into a cohesive team and to heighten
    expression. I think the e for instance might help you make a better c. What about
    a slightly deeper cut under the ball on the lc r? I also echo Paul. And It is
    still tasty! \r\n\r\n( edited for clarity ) "

    (l) are way too heavy huh? The a is holding up pretty well - but I am starting
    to wonder about a wider opening - and maybe a less tall one. The d needs to be
    less heavy too -in the bowl & the ascender. I would looks for ways to make the
    u less like a reversed & flipped n. The big surpise though is the 't'. It is really
    not fitting. That would be my suggestion as job #1. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Are your vertical arches thicker than your vertical stems? They usually need to
    be thicker to look balanced with the stems. "

    As far as selling the font afterwards as being your own creation, that's a different

    for information. He practically doesn't do anything but mixing and messing up

  body: "Here's something I wrote about myself & my work a few months back. It seconds
    your opinion, Haley, about it being very hard to make anything original... After
    all, for every single thing there can only be one pioneer.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion
    innovation is overrated. Everything has been done before & the only thing left
    for us to do is to add personal flavour. My work is merely a reflection of personal
    taste & skills. You can't hide the things that inspire and I've never had the
    intention to do so in any way. I'm not ashamed of my muse & everything I do can
    be seen as an ode to her. I can\u2019t take credit for my own work \u2018cause
    even if the apprentice should exceed his master, the honour still belongs to the
    latter. I\u2019m a thief of ideas. I steal with my eyes the creations of other
    people\u2019s minds and use their blueprints as my guide. But always with love
    and respect for what I\u2019ve seen \u2013secretly hoping that one day I too will
    be copied in some kind of poetic justice where the hunter gets hunted, inspiring
    others with what I admire and pass the torch, so to speak. I can only pray to
    become a chackle in the chain of inspiration, bringing life to new creations &
    encourage them to breed. \r\nMost of my friends & family think of me as being
    creative, but I beg to differ. I just think I have a good eye for detail & the
    stamina to apply this to my work. In graphic design you always need to find the
    right balance between clarity & aesthetics. I always opt in favour for the latter.
    Even the simplest design can eat up a whole lot of my time 'cause I like to explore
    all possibilities before settling with a final result & although the last word
    may suggest otherwise, I'll take quality over quantity anytime. "
