  body: "AFAIK this was originally a font made by Hoefler for the Mac and its appearance
    in the PC world was the result of people using Transtype rather than a publication
    by Hoefler.\r\nAs for legitimate use on a PC this would seem to depend on obtaining
    permission from Hoefler .\r\nDon"

  body: "The font was designed by F. H. Ehmcke for the Flinsch foundry in 1908. Bauer
    sold it as Ehmcke. Stephenson Blake also sold it, or a very similar version, as
    Carlton.\r\nFWIIW I prefer the digital version produced by Hoefler.\r\nDon"
