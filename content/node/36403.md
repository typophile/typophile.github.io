body: "So I have received a BFA in graphic design at a school with a minimal type
  course selection. Typography has always been a small interest of mine, but its so
  easy to get demoralized by the depth of people's knowledge of typefaces and their
  sometimes bizarre tastes and hatreds of specific families. I, technically, understand
  a decent amount of information about typefaces, but I was wondering if anyone had
  any suggestions if I want to get into it more. \r\n\r\nI can recognize the \"big\"
  type families, but whats the best way to get to know type better? Should I pick
  up some specimen books and spend hours studying them? \r\n\r\nI understand that
  the more I use type the more I'll know about them, and be able to recognize faces.
  But you gotta start somewhere. What do you guys think, is there any wisdom you can
  bestow on me?\r\n\r\nI'm in Boston, MA if there is any regional specific wisdom
  you can provide."

    and embrace the religion of type?
