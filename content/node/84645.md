body: "I am trying to find some pictures to illustrate this, but I was wondering if
  Dutch (or 1700s Dutch) was like Cyrillic where there are two \"capital K's.\" This
  seems unlikely, but one K has a serif at the top, where another has a ball terminal.
  It seems to follow a pattern of using the K ball terminal at the end of a word,
  but the middle forms have the K. I found several examples.\r\n\r\nThese forms are
  found on maps from the 1500-1700's by Dutch map makers. They are not type, but engravings.
  Any thoughts? I found these at the Boston Public Library's private map collection.
  (which is awesome!)\r\n\r\nI am contemplating researching the subject and doing
  a brief presentation at TypeCon on 1500-1700 Dutch map making. Some history, methods,
  and the players involved. Any interest in that?\r\n\r\nImage: http://twitpic.com/677uzc#"

  body: Several of the other initial caps have a ball flourish too.  R in particular
    appears in 2 different forms.  Neat example!

    lots of information. But this is just a guess, I have no information on it."

    you to post a threat in the Dutch cartographers group on LinkedIn. Here is certainly
    someone who can provide you with more insights using the K balls or point you

  body: "I don't think Dutch ever has had distinct forms of K. This could well be
    embellishment.\r\n\r\nOn this map you can find examples traditional long vs. short
    s, but to my surprise, there is at least one occurrence of a long s at the end
    of a name -- \"Bourneus\" near the top. I don't think that was usual.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it's a French map but the long s/short s in \"Lu\xDFon\" (above \"Rochelle\")
    suspiciously looks like a German eszet. It could be a sign of the times, but of
    course it also might simply be mapmakers' errors :-)"

    suspicious about that at all. That's the normal way doubled s was handled when
    long s was used, whether one was printing English or Latin. The German eszet today
    is just a vestige of the fact that German printing retained the long s longer
    than anyone else's printing, since the long s was part of Fraktur; so Germans
    were so used to the appearance of a double s that they retained the eszet even
    when they discarded the long s upon moving to Roman typefaces."

  body: Ok, perhaps stupid, largely un-researched question, but if memory serves Peter
    the Great visited the Netherlands around this time, eventually adopting Cyrillic
    back home. Could these different forms, which were more than likely just stylistic,
    have inspired him or others that developed the modern Cyrillic script?

    styles, so I don't think the forms you show could be considered a source for the
    conventional distinction between the Cyrillic \u041A and the Latin K."

  body: "I have a much later (1864-1950) finnish map with ball-terminals on italic
    K's, and I have also thought of it as cyrillic influence. Most of the map is actually
    made during the years of Russian rule. Another feature that seems like cyrillic
    influence is the barred tops of A's. Both of these appear in italics and backward
    slants only, but not in all of them. All the all caps words have conventional
    forms.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/map1_6497.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/map2_5372.png]\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "It's natural for hand lettering to show deviations from the norm.\r\nThese
    may be haphazard, or evolve into a personal style.\r\nSuch styles can become infectious,
    and at some point a typeface may succumb to the variant, either as default, or
    in some cases as an optional sort. That was very rare pre-digital, but now, if
    you're a type designer and can't make up your mind whether your typeface should
    have a one- or two-storey \"a\", no worries, just include both, thanks to OpenType
    stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nA different implementation, perhaps in the spirit of the
    old map: when I upgraded Fontesque with a pesudo random feature, the extra \"K\"
    was indeed Cyrillic-style. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KICK_5371.png]\r\nThe
    capitals already have several ball-ish terminals, e.g. in \"C\" and \"G\", and
    I'm pretty sure the fact that I had recently designed a Cyrillic with balled K
    (Scotch Modern) led me to implement this form.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, Archer's employment
    of balled terminals in C, G and S does not extend to the K.\r\nI suspect there
    are some lesser-known types available that have balled terminals in the caps,
    including K. \r\nAnyone?"
