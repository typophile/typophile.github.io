  body: "1. Georgia's oldstyle figures replaced by lining figures in Univers, strange,
    but presumably following some sort of logic.\r\n2. Faux italics of Univers.\r\n3.
    Never have liked fake ordinals (e.g. in 1st) either.\r\n4. Needs a double space
    after the bold italic sans side heads, before main serif text style.\r\n\r\nBut
    these are typographic nitpickings, not really important to the layout and hierarchy
    of the new bilingual layout, which I'm not really qualified to judge, not being
    familiar with the previous version. I think they want feedback from regular users
    of these kinds of documents.\r\n\r\nCanadian content: Patrick Griffin, John Hudson,
    Chester Jenkins, Ray Larabie, Rod Macdonald, Thomas Phinney, Jim Rimmer, Les Usherwood.
    \r\nShould be able to get some Georgia and Univers alternatives out of that bunch.\r\n"

  body: "As someone who reads (English) statutes on a daily basis, I was a bit surprised
    to read this in the design brief:\r\n\r\n\"The number of characters on a line
    of text influences the speed of reading and the ease of comprehension: a line
    of text that is too short can slow reading and cause eye fatigue as the eye must
    move more often from one line to the next, whereas a line that is too long may
    cause the eye to skip to the next line. With respect to long texts, the ideal
    length of a line is between 50 and 70 characters. In the new page layout, the
    lines are on average 56 characters in length (versus 42 in the current PDF version).\"\r\n\r\nMy
    experience is that most people who use statutes do not read them for any length.
    I rarely read more than one section--perhaps 150 words--in one go, and often single
    subsections of a few words are all that is required. I'm therefore not sure that
    design considerations suitable for book typography are the most appropriate in
    this case. That said, increasing the line length is certainly welcome for most
    statutes since it reduces the number of orphans when short subsections break over
    the line.\r\n\r\nHaving more information in the header and footer of each page
    is, I expect, a big improvement, since single pages from acts are (in the UK at
    least) regularly printed and it is helpful to have as much information about where
    they came from as is possible.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I wish they would prepare the
    PDFs so that copying from them is easier. Particularly since this a bi-lingual
    text, in two columns. Testing it in a few PDF readers, I can't successfully copy
    two consecutive sections from the same language without pulling in a section from
    the other; something which would be extremely annoying if I had to use these on
    a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the type, it doesn't seem to be a very radical
    change over the old system. I like the bold Univers figures for the section numbers
    but find them quite distracting in the running text. It is interesting that they
    have turned the marginal comments into headings for each section. In the UK, these
    are added editorially by the printers after the Act is approved by Parliament.
    This affects the weight given to them as aids to interpreting the statute by the
    Courts since they were not directly approved by the legislature. If the Canadians
    have the same system, then this could cause confusion since the typography clearly
    suggests them to be part of the Act.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a reason why
    the subsections in English are labeled (a) (b) (c) &c. and those in French a)
    b) c)?"

  body: "Statutes are also my bread and butter: and these are disgusting.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I can see the point of these bold subsection numbers, everything looks too smashed
    together. If I had to deal with Canadian legislation I would get very sore eyes
    very quickly. And the chapter headings do not stand out at all (the face is too
    narrow) - which is a problem, as I use section headings to catch my eye when I'm
    flicking through a statute trying to find a correct chapter (and if it's too narrow,
    I'm not going to see it).\r\n\r\nForgive me, but I am a fan of the Queensland
    legislation layout. Yes, it's boring. Yes, it's simple. But it works: which is
    the most important thing for me: http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/A/ApiariesA82.pdf"

    I don't know how they can bare to deal with that on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I often think is lacking from the electronically published statutes which was
    present in the older versions is a enough gravitas. I think legislation from a
    national government should give the appearance of having authority. Many electronically
    published ones look no different to the constitution of a football club or amateur
    dramatics society."

    paragraphs, but when the highlighting hits a subhead, it jumps over to the other
    column. That would get frustrating really fast.\r\n\r\nThe Univers numerals in
    the text are awful. Especially when they're used for French dates: \xAB 1er juin
    2009 \xBB. Univers 1, followed by fake superscript er, normal text juin, Univers

  body: "Scott: at least on my machine, xpdf doesn't properly handle the soft hyphens
    and copies the text literally as it appears (which reminds me that it was one
    reason I switched to evince on Linux). The only reader I can find which allows
    column selection in a vaguely sensible way is Foxit Reader on Windows. I'm surprised
    that the PDF specification doesn't specify a proper way of handling columns or,
    if it does, that it is not implemented by the readers.\r\n\r\nNick: I think the
    difficulty with these documents is the volume that are produced each day. Looking
    at the UK's [[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/new/2011-02-16|Legislation Site]],
    there were 60 pieces of legislation published yesterday (albeit all Statutory
    Instruments rather than Statutes), some of which can run to several hundred pages.
    If they are also attempting to published up-to-date legislation showing consolidated
    amendments, then I think some automatic generation is going to be inevitable,
    since the costs of getting everything professional set might be prohibitive. That's
    not to say the templates should not be properly designed and implemented, nor
    that official printed versions should not be properly set, but I think there is
    a limited to what can be done for the consolidated versions. In the old days,
    when going to the higher courts in the UK, one was required to have the pleadings
    printed ([[http://www.scottishlawreports.org.uk/resources/dvs/donoghue-v-stevenson.html|e.g.]])
    but that seems to have died a death in the name of efficiency and so it's not
    surprising that the statutes are going that way too."
