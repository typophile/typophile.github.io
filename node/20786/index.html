I&rsquo;ve added a better sample, per Paul&rsquo;s comment.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of typographic design, logotype lettering, and all that, but this is my first commissioned font. that said, you would hope I gave it plenty of incubation time &ndash; not so. hopefully you&rsquo;ll be kind enough to give me some direction for beta release two.</p>
<p>the type is for a consumer catalog, that averages around six products per page, and favors filling the space as much as possible with image. it was to replace a very good titling script that had become the scape goat for other issues. the brief was to create something that was more readable and economical than a script, and it was suggested that it not be anything too &ldquo;wierd&rdquo;. the biggest hurdle was that I had about two weeks of &ldquo;free-time&rdquo; to complete one weight and style that would be put to immediate use. to assist in my expediency, I started with series of drawings I had been working on for educational purposes &ndash; something quite traditional, fortunately.</p>
<p>I completed the font on time, and to great acceptance by the decision-makers on the project. the trouble is, the quality is not what I would like it to be (especially in terms of spacing), so I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of hand-work in it&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>I have some time now to re-address the type, but I&rsquo;d like some solid feedback before I start messing around. any opinions would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s exactly where my earlier study began. oddly enough, it&rsquo;s also one of the reference faces the approval commitee liked. Perpetua had many of the features they were looking for, but it didn&rsquo;t fit with the overall needs in many ways.</p>
<p>one of the things that troubles me is though it works better for the client, I still much perfer Perpetua. I suppose trumping Gill is a foolish goal for any of us, lest of all an amateur!</p>
<p><cite>one thing strikes me as out of place is that the right stem of the U</cite></p>
<p>absolutely! I actually hadn&rsquo;t looked at it much&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of the characters I spent next to zero time with, since it doesn&rsquo;t occur much in our use.</p>

If it were me I would want a different enough concept to justify the work that will be needed to complete it&ndash;as well as a reason for others to use it rather than Perpetua. If you started with Perpetua&rsquo;s outlines, there may also be legal problems, as Monotype Imaging&rsquo;s EULA doesn&rsquo;t allow modification.</div>

<p>thanks fontplayer! you&rsquo;re absolutely right about the customer. besides, I figure they&rsquo;ll be looking for something new within the year anyway. I was just concerned about developing my own skills.</p>
<p><cite>If it were me I would want a different enough concept to justify the work</cite></p>
<p>quite true. I&rsquo;d like to get it back to paper (where I&rsquo;m more comfortable) for some more analysis. is there any pervasive quality you can put into words that screams Perpetua to you?</p>
<p><cite>If you started with Perpetua’s outlines</cite></p>
<p>actually I started with it on paper. I was trying to think through Gill&rsquo;s reasoning by drawing the characters exactly as he had first. I then went back and attacked it with Perpetua nowhere in sight. once I had a good selection of characters down, I went into FLS5 to get a feel for the digitization process.</p>
<p>that was all mostly just an excercise, but it happened to fit the bill on this project.</p>
<p>for this version, I picked-up my drawings and matched Gill&rsquo;s stem width (I liked their weight on the page). I then proceded to touch up my outlines and spacing for use around 40 points.</p>
