  it didn't import -- or even offer to import -- my InDesign CS2 configurations and
  preferences. I just can't believe that I'll have to recreate all my workspaces,
  arrangement of panels, default character and paragraph styles, etc, etc, etc. Any
  suggestions?\r\n\r\n(Sorry if this has been asked and answered before, but the search
  facility yielded no results. I'm a bit suspicious, though, because the term <em>cs3</em>
  alone returned no results either, but I'm sure there's been some discussion about
  the new Creative Suite.)"

  body: FWIW I do agree, but it may not automate those, you can import them. Can't
    you?

    a way to do that. Mind you, I googled this extensively before posting my question
    here. If anyone finds a way to import preferences, please share the solution with
    the rest of us."

  body: Ok I was wrong, it isn't importing. Within the application folder you have
    a presets folder. Within that folder you'll find the workspace folder. I believe,
    you can move your old workspace into there.

  body: "Thanks, Tina and Tiffany. I was reluctant to copy files from the CS2 to the
    CS3 install/configuration directories because there have been changes in the way
    some things work, so inevitably there will be changes in the structure of most
    configuration files. But by now I think it's pretty clear that Adobe has not provided
    us with any simple, hassle-free alternatives.\r\n\r\nAin't that nice: launch a
    slightly modified version of your software every year, charge a few hundred dollars
    for the upgrade (several hundred if you are in the developing world), and don't
    even bother to make transition from the previous version easy. Way to go, Adobe."

    to CS3. The underlying technology is completely different, and that was the only
    way to go, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/video_workshop/?id=vid0065\">in
    order to provide the current flexibility</a>.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that comes
    with the trade-off that the preferences are not sharable between the two versions.
    AFAIK, if anyone tries to use the \u201CActive-Workspace.xml\u201D file from CS2
    with CS3, will get a warning message saying that the file was saved in an old
    format.\r\n\r\nBTW, in case someone is doing InDesign scripting, this change will
    also affect you.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/indesign/sdk/InDesign_CS3_SDK_whats-new.pdf\">As
    noted on this file</a> (PDF),\r\n<cite><strong>Palette and Panel-related APIs
    Changes</strong> \u2014 Adobe adopted a new common palette appearance for all
    Adobe Creative Suite\xAE 3 applications. Implementing this new appearance in InDesign
    required an extensive rewrite of InDesign\u2019s palette system, including changes
    to public APIs and how palette resources are specified.</cite>"
