body: Given the responses to a few questions I had about Neue Helvetica, and a recent
  response to someone inquiring about Swiss 721, I am curious as to what the type
  savvy person might choose for body text, if they wanted a conservative yet interesting
  sans serif font?

  body: "Legato is the most readable sans. It's nothing like Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI think
    one of the most readable grots is Unica (although some\r\nsay it's not grot enough)
    but it's no longer available for purchase.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'For text, humanist sans are better than grotesque or geometric IMHO. And
    for really extended, serifed faces. For a humanist sans, certainly Frutiger is
    great, and the similar Myriad. Gerard Unger''s Vesta, which has some additional
    contrast, is very readable in text. '
