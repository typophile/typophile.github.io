  body: your attached image is probably a CMYK-image, which wont show up in many (or
    all?) browsers. but i assume you mean the logo of PAGE, which can be seen <a href="http://www.page-online.de/"
    target="_blank">on their website</a>. afaik this is custom, im pretty sure i have
    read about that before.

    at the office.\r\nI dont mean the Page logo though, but a headline: \xBBDIE SIEBEN
    WEBWUNDER\xAB a sturdy geometric allcaps? font. Have a look here >\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/200610_4913.jpg]"

  body: "You probably don't want to hear what I think about square 'Techno' fonts,
    but let's just say that they are hard for me to ID because there is too little
    that's memorable about them.\r\n\r\nI looked through the Indie Fonts Book 2, and
    spotted something quite close to the 'DIE 7 WEB WUNDER' lettering -- close enough
    to make modification easy -- and it's <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=301\">'Tremble'</a>
    by Adam Hayes of Identikal. The only letters you would need to modify are the
    U, N and R -- all relatively simple forms that you could make from other letters
    in the font. In fact, the R looks like it might have been made from the K or k;
    and the U & N could be made by deleting one line of the O.\r\n\r\nIf that approach
    doesn't appeal to you, I'd start searching the Dafont.com 'Techno' category for
    a freebie, if no one else ID's this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
