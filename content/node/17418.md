body: "Hello.\r\nIs there a handy utility (for the PC) that allows me to edit a font,
  say a truetype master , and then export it as a bitmap at various sizes. I would
  ordinarily just edit a bitmap and then resize it and then tweak it so I've got a
  10 point a and 8 point version. This is all fine, but when it comes to doing several
  sizes of the bitmap font it starts getting a bit tedious (Especially when I can
  test the font using Bitmap Font Writer, but utimatley have to remove the deliniators
  (spaces between characters) in order to save space as is complient with our own
  bitmap file format. I could just render out the font (no anti-aliasing) at various
  sizes keeping the text \"live\" and then tweaking the hinting to my heart's content.
  Is there such a program (other than Bitfonter)? Thanks.\r\n\r\n"
