  like to get off my HelveticaNeue-addiction. Can anyone suggest some modern san serif
  faces... on the lines of art magazine fonts? I am looking for faces that have thinner
  weights for body copy and such.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!"

  body: "Greetings. I, too, have been looking for a lovely sans serif typeface which
    I could use for a variety of purposes, including body text, headings, display.\r\n\r\nFor
    a while now, my face of choice has been Brioso, and I still love that! Now I need
    a compliment, a companion.\r\n\r\nI do like Scott's suggestion of \"Gotham\" and
    I'm seriously considering that. There were a couple other faces I loved from typography.com,though
    they seem a bit pricey.\r\n\r\nI was tempted to get the whole Helvetica Neue family,
    but sheesh! At least from Adobe that's nearly $1,000. I had no idea!\r\n\r\nI
    do hope this thread will receive a few more suggestions.\r\n\r\nOH, and does anyone
    have a suggestion or two for a typeface that evokes the Near and Middle East?
    I have a friend who puts on occasional cultural events and I'd love to help her
    do fliers, posters, and announcements.\r\n\r\nMy thanks and regards,\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n\r\nFabricando

    retro (i.e. with a mid-20th century vibe) faces like Gotham and Helvetica, a good
    match might be <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/legende/\">Legende</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: From FontBureau, [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness|Vonness]]. Some
    of its weights are a very good choice for magazine, and not only titles, but cover,
    small headlines, etc. As stated above, Gotham is a very good choice. It is also
    suitable for a presidential campaign :)

    more than enough character to rise above the ashes of Helvetica. Both are available

  body: "If you're looking for an unfussy classic sans workhorse (and some options
    above are excellent), there's also Lintoype Syntax, available with default-loaded
    oldstyle figures. In my view, it's the closest to perfect among all sans of whatever
    style, mainly because the base weight is so well judged, not too heavy as with
    so many other starting weights. Also, ITC Franklin Gothic, tho it doesn't have
    OSFs. \r\n\r\nFreight Sans is the leading Gill-Sans-inflected design recently,
    and many more followed its lead. A warning about Verlag: in actual use it comes
    off surprisingly rough and vulgar, lacking the finesse and finish you expect from
    that foundry."
