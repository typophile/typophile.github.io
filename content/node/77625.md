  body: It doesn't really need a dash at all, but if you do use one it would be the
    same as when attributing a quotation, which should be an em dash.

  body: "Things have changed. The dashes are dead pauper. There's a hierarchy now.\r\n\r\nThere's
    Brackets.\r\n\r\n[VBM] \r\n\r\nBold. Commanding. The epitome of a powerful performance
    signature.\r\n\r\nDenotes that everything within is important. Because you are.
    You want people to feel privileged that you graced them with your presence. Let
    them know that YES, you are a fucking god, and they should bow down and kiss your
    pinky ring. Its both a seal and a signature. Its the end all. The final word.
    The master almighty of the topic.\r\n\r\nThere's the line bar. \r\n\r\n|SomeGuy
    \ \r\n\r\nUsed by those who lack the full deserving entitlement of brackets, yet
    who are superior to the norm. It proclaims that I divide the conversation. The
    signature for the definitive on the subject matter at hand. The voice. The bracket
    bearer's proxy. The next in line.\r\n\r\nUnicode comes next.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr.Nobody

    The artisan. Rogue, brash, and individual. The unicode symbols are used by everyone
    with a purpose. A destiny, a goal, a direction. The line bar always in reach,
    yet only grasped by a few. These people live. And live inspired.\r\n\r\nDashes
    are at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\u2014Bore\r\n\r\nOld. Outdated. Boring. Says to the
    world, I'm dead inside. I've given up. I made a half-assed attempt at being recognized.
    Laugh at my apathy.\r\n\r\n:0 :) ^^"

    "double-hyphen-typewriter-style." Usage depends on the tools available.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/signature!_4535.gif]'
