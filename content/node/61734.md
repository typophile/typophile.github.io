body: "Here's a confused question.\r\n\r\nI'm finalizing a logo for a client, and
  suddenly started wondering if it wouldn't be a nice extra service to give the client
  not just individual files, but maybe a \"logo font\" just with the different versions
  of the logo in it (so only maybe 5 glyphs). That way it might be easier for the
  client to use the logo (fewer different files/formats), and I wouldn't have to worry
  a lot about the thing being scaled wrong or whathaveyou.\r\n\r\nSo if I have a logo
  that's based on a (commercial) font which I've customized in Illustrator, and I
  make this into a font again, is this technically a legal problem?\r\n\r\nAlso, is
  there anything else I'm forgetting that might make this a bad idea to offer to the
  client?"

    deliver a logo. You should specify minimum point size for usage probably.

    useful they were too.

    single glyph? It doesn't sound anything like you distributing a custom version
    of that font -- rather, you supply the <em>image</em> in the form of a font. I
    don't see how that would differ from giving them an EPS or PDF version.\r\n\r\nIt
    would get slightly complicated if they asked for the customized font, to use for
    advertising or other graphic work.\r\n\r\nThe few fonts I made (for internal use
    only!!) use an OpenType feature to change \"JW\" into my own logo :-) as a sort
    of easter egg."

    Theunis \u2013 my gut feeling was telling me the same, but hey you never know.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"It
    would get slightly complicated if they asked for the customized font, to use for
    advertising or other graphic work.\"</cite>\r\nIt couldn't get complicated really,
    as there is no customized font \u2013 there is only a logo customized from the
    font (i.e. the tweaks are in Illustrator, not inside the font). That is a bit
    impractical, but at least this way I'm fine as per the EULA."

  body: "The only big technical downside is that some programs, including MS Word,
    will not display glyphs that are more than too wide (I can\u2019t find documentation
    of the actual numbers). For some logos this will mean either shrinking it down
    so small that fidelity is lost or chopping it up across glyphs. So be careful
    before you make promises about what you can stuff into a font!"

  body: James hinted at UPM being another technical consideration. You might have
    to optimize some handles or bump up the UPM to make sure things aren't getting
    distorted.

  body: When I worked in business, I never wanted our corporate logo as a font because
    too many times I've seen a strange letter(s) in an arbitrary font appearing on
    e.g. a presentation that got sent out us working on a pc without the font in question.
    That result is more unprofessional than not giving the client the option to make
    that mistake! Not sure you can trust the average client not to do the same. Ban
    logo fonts, I say (you won't have to worry about the legalities either)!

  body: In the magazine world a logo font is definitely the format of choice. Junior
    designers can endlessly change the color and size of the logo on the cover as
    the Design Director stands behind them shouting directions. "Bigger, no, no smaller,
    no, no not that small. Add 20 magenta, no, no, why did you add so much magenta!
    Needs more blue!" etc and so on.
