  Clarendon for the headlines but i need a typeface that would complement it for the
  body text. i have tried to do some research and experimented with some sans-serif's
  like FF Unit but all in vain as i am not 100% sure if it works or not. \r\nthank
  you for your help"

    is going to be a combination of a story about a red shirt with information graphics
    and statistics, so i was looking for something like Clarendon for the headlines,
    and something for the body text which would also be used for information graphics
    and numbers. i also thought something like Din would help make it fun [in context
    to my subject]. i don't know if that makes sense, but that was my thought process...\r\ni
    will try and see if i can make only Clarendon work\r\nthank you very much for

    it for a new project, as well.

  body: "Any grotesque sans would match, as that is the comparable 19th century style.\r\nSo
    Arial or Helvetica would be fine, although Arial is not really a display face.\r\n\r\nFor
    a serif text face, a Scotch (another 19th century genre) would work, so Georgia.\r\n\r\nYou
    don't have to buy those faces, as they are likely on your school computers.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, I would recommend the principle of historical allusion, i.e. matching
    types designed in the same era, because they tend to have an inherent harmony
    of shape."

  body: "Just a general observation: Most book (interior) designers pick the text
    font first, and get that to look right.\r\n\r\nThis is not simple. Usually, the
    designer is given the trim size (must be 6-1/8 x 9-1/4 inches, for example). Frequently,
    they are given a characters-per-page specification. With a 6x9 trim, you are likely
    to see the  2,800 character number, but sometimes it is 2,900, and I've seen as
    high as 3,200 or as few as 2,000.\r\n\r\nAnd you must have margins. You are designing
    a page -- actually, a pair of pages, with the mechanical intervention of the binding.
    While old-school, a 26 pica measure with a 42-pica depth (for 6x9) is both traditional,
    and follows the old golden ratio to 1 to .618. Shorter measures are OK, but remember
    that regular, even wordspacing is by in large determined by the number of words
    on a line. The number of words determines how many wordspaces, and wordspaces
    are the best place to vary for justification.\r\n\r\nOne thing I still do is to
    print out the pages on the laser printer, cut them to final size, and slip them
    into a book to see how it is all working. You would be surprised to see how much
    the extra white space on an 8.5x11 sheet (or worse, the computer monitor) throws
    off your eye.\r\n\r\nObviously you have some idea of the display face when you
    pick the text, but usually the text font is the most important design choice.
    Once the text is working, it is time to finalize & maybe change your thinking
    about the display face.\r\n\r\nWhy all this? Books are meant to be read; the audience
    will spend many more hours with the text type than with the display type. This
    is different from book JACKET design, poster design, or advertising design.\r\n\r\nWhich
    may explain why there are so few good designers  of book interiors -- it isn't
    terribly exciting, just a lot of work requiring a good eye."

    the same going each way. The ratio of long to short is 1.618; conversely the ratio
    of short to long is 0.618. (Rounded off, of course.)\r\n\r\nSo, you and Charles
    are both correct.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Just a general observation: Most book (interior) designers pick the
    text font first, and get that to look right.</cite>\r\n\r\nNot so. I design illustrated
    books, mostly art books and cookbooks and am often required to do the cover before
    I design the interior. So frequently I know my display or headline font before
    I have settled on a text face. I am also often using more than one font: one for
    body copy, another for captions, sidebar elements, etc. It sounds like Sumila's
    project is more in this vein. \r\n\r\nFor trade book design, the interior and
    cover are often designed separately and there I agree with Charles that the text
    face is the most important choice.\r\n\r\n<cite>Frequently, they are given a characters-per-page
    specification</cite>\r\n\r\nI more often deal with words/page. Although that number
    isn't given to me, it's something I need to figure out based on word count, page
    count, number of pix and approx. sizes.\r\n\r\nI agree that you MUST print the
    pages out and cut them down before you have committed to your font choices, you
    really can't judge by the computer screen. For example, I have to view a page
    at 137% in order to see the text at actual size. You probably do too if you have
    a newish computer.\r\n"

    match up well as a text face. It would be hard to find a typeface used more in
    infographics and such over the years since it's used in about a billion newspapers
    as the primary text face. \r\n\r\nIt still has the little tails on the letters
    and the stress is vertical, as in Clarendon."
