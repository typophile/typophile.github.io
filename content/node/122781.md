  body: "I guess it depends on whether you want a complement or a contrast ;)\r\n\r\nIf
    you want a complement, to me it has a distinct Arts & Crafts feeling (a bit less
    severe than the most traditional old-style fonts, a bit more rounded), a bit like
    something Goudy might have done. So would [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-goudy-sans/|Goudy
    Sans]] work? That's calligraphic and humanist, but in an eccentric way. The italic
    would show it off at its best.\r\n\r\nI guess the alternative would be if you
    want a contrast a typeface that looks good in bold so it really stands out against
    the serif font. Perhaps an old grotesque font with a bit of irregularity might
    be nice - maybe something out of [[http://fontfeed.com/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/|Stephen
    Coles' list]]. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/std-bold-extended|Monotype
    Gothic Bold Extended, say]] (caution: spacing is a bit off). Or [[http://www.huertatipografica.com/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht|Alegreya
    Sans]], though that's more calligraphic again."
