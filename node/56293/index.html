  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Saw this and thought of you people and wondered what you'd have to say on the subject;
http://www.good.is/?p=8133

Is learning to handwrite important in the understanding of words and communication? or, should we now learn to touch-type from an early age? 

My instant thought is that handwriting is important. Especially in making notes of ideas or phone numbers etc, but thats probably just because its how I was educated I guess. 

Maybe I'll experiment with not using a pen or pencil for a week (except drawing) and just using stickies and notes (though perhaps I should buy some piece of i-phone/blackberry type technology first…)</div>

Heresy, idiocy the sky is falling.

Just kidding. As a calligrapher/lettering artist with both feet in the computer age I look at their opinion and just smile. I wonder if, in the future, there will be a correlation between never having picked up a graphite stick and never having gone to bed with a "good book?"

I know one thing... my kids never washed a dish with a sponge and soap. Use the dishwasher dad : )

It'll be one of those interesting facets about something that somehow in an elite crowd might make them seem "more intellectual" but not much else.

On the other hand, as a child of the computer age, and having done school projects on computer from third grade on (hard to do handwriting journals on the computer :) ), I find quickly drawing diagrams, taking non-textual notes and other sorts of things nearly impossible on the computer, at least not at the speed needed to keep up in class or a meeting.  So barring some new fancy program, I expect to see handwriting live on as a very very niche use.

I shouldn’t be too surprised, the piece was written by an educator.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the author of the article is confusing the nature of the problem she and her son are facing, although the first paragraph says it all:

<em>My son, who is in third grade, spends much of his school day struggling to learn how to form the letter “G.” Sometimes he writes it backwards. Sometimes the tail on his lowercase “T” goes the wrong way. His teachers keep telling him he may fail the state assessment standards.</em>

The problem isn't handwriting, the problem is schools, teachers and things like state assessment standards. Most schooling is institutional child abuse, and giving up pens and pencils in favour of computers isn't going to change that.

I'd say that making a G backwards and then gradually understanding shape orientation is a pretty important developmental step: probably more important as a step than being able to write the G correctly. Of course, shape orientation can be learned in other ways, but writing letters and numbers is a good way to learn it and comes with other benefits: fine motor skills (which you don't get, for example, learning shape orientation by flipping and rotating shapes on a computer screen), and of course the ability to produce something that someone else can read, even if the only thing you have to hand is a stick of graphite. And contra what the author writes, there is lots of evidence of the importance of manual interaction in intellectual development (and for this reason it is one of the key principles of the Montessori method, which strikes me as pretty much the only humane and sane approach to education for young children).</div>

Almost $5 billion of pens, pencils and markers are sold in the US every year.
Presumably these will be written with, although pencils are also useful for making seed-holes in soil.
This blogger's understanding of the issue is subjectively skewed, to put it politely.

Somewhat related, shouldn't doctors (who write prescriptions) be required to pass a writing exam as part of their qualifications?
How much more efficient would that make the work of pharmacists, and may even save a few lives.

		<div class="commentbody">Flipped and rotated letters by children are a very NORMAL sign of development and get corrected as soon as the particular child develops a bit more. It is NOTHING to be concerned about nor dreaded. Government  insistence that standardized testing by means of remembering meaningless dribble has done more to dismantle education than anything. Government officials are seeking ways to "PROVE" that children are learning as much as those in other countries and force teachers to waste precious time on test preparation rather than on learning important skills. All of these tests have done is prove that kids learned more before we started testing!
Exercising the brain is an important thing to do. One of the important ways to do it is by reading and writing. Writing is a developmental process which begins slowly with numerous errors which give students something to examine and learn by doing. No wonder students today have so little initiative, they have it strangled out of them before they are 10 years old!

It isn't a matter of if we will later in life communicate by our handwriting, it is a case of learning the process of having different segments of our brain work together to do many different tasks.

But that doesn't rule out the question of the respective importance that should be attributed to learning handwriting, and other methods of producing letters. I see, and respect, the point that learning which way round to draw a "G" has beneficial effects besides actually learning about lettershapes, but shouldn't education also be about preparing kids for the world they live in? Meaning, get them in touch with the tools of the time as well.

For what it's worth, I learned to write (and read) with my mum's typewriter when I was about four. I don't think this harmed my understanding of words and communication at all. Quite the opposite, actually. "Look, Ma, I can press these keys here in a different order and it makes a new word!"

That said, I'm not sure the idea of trying to immediately and completely abolish handwriting is fruitful, or practicable today (though it might be soon). I'm thinking a small dose of handwriting will remain in our lives as a tool next to other tools for a while; at least as long as we don't have good enough digital tools to enable us to note down say a phone number quickly, handwriting will remain useful*. &ndash; But definitely, teach kids to type!

* And maybe voice recognition will/can be just that. But accessibility factors in here as well; not everyone will be able to afford fancy tools when they could use pen and paper.</div>

Graham, time is the most valuable thing you have - don't waste it learning something you won't need. How much will you need handwriting? What will it teach you? Do take one calligraphy class (not the same thing as handwriting) if you have some extra time, but take a bag of salt with you! Most calligraphy teachers (like most any teacher I guess) engage in self-validation to the point of deluding their students concerning the importance of their own world.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it's editorial so it's meant to stir the pot. Handwriting is essential, of course...it's a foundation skill set for us to learn the alphabet and to read.

That said, as a parent of young kids, there is some arguments for not depending on it so much. Kids are definitely typing much younger than they ever were before.

Our 7 year old has atrocious handwriting. Part of that is due to switching schools where they were mixing handwriting methods. Part of that is likely genetic. ;0) But put him in front of the computer, and he can type just fine. 

So, I agree in that as soon as handwriting becomes the hurdle between the subject matter and the student absorbing it, it's time to allow for alternatives.

		<div class="commentbody">I think handwriting is a very important part of our development as a child (or even as adults). I don't think it's a matter of needing it or not. It also teaches a young brain abstract thinking, hand-eye coördination, etc. I can't really explain it very well in English, but I think you get my point.

I can't imagine why someone would <em>not</em> want to learn how to write well. Just because the 'need' for it is becoming a less important factor? I think that's a pretty weak argument. You also don't 'need' to learn how to play the piano, but alot of people do it anyway.

I can remember I was really proud when I learned how to write somwhat readable. My first school used to teach a non-italic non-connected type of handwriting, when I switched schools the new school tought a connected-italic-like writing method, and I loved it! Now I could write in two different ways, how marvelous! This is also what sparked my interest in typography and type design.</div>

In headless chicken mode, yes. Ideally, it is <em>thought</em> that does this.
And this is why Hangul makes Latin look like a village idiot.

What's distinctive about Hangul is its intelligence as a representational system. This includes its basis in articulatory phonetics, and it's transparency to syllabic componency. However as a system of marks or strokes, according to the wikipedia.org entry on Hangul that I consulted, all Hangul letters follow the rules of Chinese calligraphy.

By the 1400s, chinese calligraphy had long become an optical-grammatically mature and combinatorially powerful script.

Writing is not the headless horseman Hrant wants to pretend it is. The problem with the latin script is not it's optical-grammatical structure, nor its combinatory arithmetic. It's its wonkiness as a representational system for the articulatorily fluid and linguistically polyglot environment it has to serve, extending it far beyond the Latin of it's birth.

Learning writing is an inculcation of the perceptual psychophysical grammatology of a script. [edited]

In Hangul the isomorphism is between the physical gestural logic of the hand in making marks, drawn feom an inherited mark-grammer, and the articulatory gestural logic of the mouth in making sounds.</div>

No.

> all Hangul letters follow the rules of Chinese calligraphy.

Actually, it is documented that the initial proposal consisted entirely of constructed letterforms, which -in part- attempted to visualize the speech organs, with no basis on Chinese calligraphy, or any calligraphy. It was to appease his court, which was of course infested with status-quo Chinese-language bureaucrats, that the Chinese calligraphy angle was spliced in. Without that ruse Koreans would have remained stuck.

In any case, you shouldn't conveniently forget that Hangul was invented way before the digital era! If it were invented today, King Sejong's astuteness would probably have incorporated the best of current technology.

> Writing is not the headless horseman Hrant wants to pretend it is.

Writing is not headless. People who cling to it as children are. They are afraid of leaving the house. May the gods give them the strength... or at least prevent them from dragging the rest of us down with them.

> Learning writing is an inculcation of the inner workings of a script.

For almost all scripts that's certainly true. But some of us are more interested in improvement, as opposed to simply imitating past mistakes.

The only real way to figure out how a script <em>needs</em> to work is to... think!

In fact I wonder if written language is capable of properly explaining thought (or even spoken language). Would it have to be constructed of forms that could have lots of additional marks 'bolted on' in order to express the various associations with which we make up any one thought? 

hmmmmmm. Two beers and I'm talking this much rubbish.

What remains very practical however is something like Legato, which throws the hand overboard (no matter how much the acolytes of GN want to distort it).

Well, although that's not what I was thinking, I certainly believe that writing systems can be much more complex than the Latin script for example, leveraging our reading abilities better. Just like Morse Code can work, but it's not at all efficient. Chinese I don't think is too complex, and Hangul certainly isn't.

Me too!
I like lard too; but I don't pretend it's a cornerstone of society.

> I’d say to isolate the brain is a mistake.

In fact it is impossible. But the hand does not contain any cognitive powers! One some level conclusions must be thought out, using the brain. And it does not make sense to allow the circumstantial structure of the hand/arm system (coupled to some arbitrary marking tool no less) to dictate what makes sense in terms of the functionality of reading. Unless one invokes some mystical synergy between all the parts of the body...

Anyway, I've said all this a million times before. But some people just don't want to let go - it would be no fun for them to let go, and they want to have fun. Ergo, it is not possible to administer psychotherapy via ASCII...

Peter, I forget. But it's out there, and not buried very deep. The thing is, why get hung up on a historical instance? Just because some guy did something one way or another means very little - it should not become an excuse to avoid the guidance of logic and reason.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually I didn't mean to over-emphasize digital creation. Letterforms that are made by arranging pebbles on a beach for example can be superior to handwriting in certain ways. The point isn't to find some ideal method, but to see the flaws in every method, and not fetishize any of them. Especially useful is seeing the flaws in a method that oppressively crushes out everything else.

Developing fine motors skills can be done without creating and fostering misleading illusions of functionality; teaching kids to make letters by expanding skeletons without immediately warning them that when it comes to reading skeletons are irrelevant is a disservice to society. And cognitive development need not be impeded by cozy anachronisms - there are many ways to get kids (and adults) to think without perpetuating lies.

BTW, I don't disdain handwriting. I just think it's headed the way of cuneiform writing. One thing I do disdain however is ideological lassitude.

The consequent of my claims above is not that type design imitate writing. Hrant knows that's not what I think. Hrant knows that I'm an advocate of systematic and well-motivated norm-violation when it comes to contrast-styling in type design. I'm also open to role-architectural exploration or reconfiguration in letter-form construction to enhance divergence [edited] or when the mapping problems of the current system become too complex. Hrant and I might have different ideas of where the tipping point might lie. Maybe eventually Hangul will fill the breech after the decline of the west has continued apace. Until then, I don't really see much prospect for a wholesale retranscription from within.

The consequent of my claim above is that there are strong personal developmental and cultural historical reasons to continue / reinvigorate writing.

You're right.
I've done all I can in the past*, and I dislike repetition - I value the new; I do not celebrate the past, I build a better future (well, I try). My main motivation these days is to make sure people, especially newbies, know there are people who think that at least some of the arguments you (plural) make are hogwash.

I'm not sure what you mean by "retranscription". But I certainly see an opportunity to ween people off chirography. At least people who have the luxury to be undecided; too many people are too old (ideologically). And you see an opportunity for what, reviving handwriting? Nauseating. Hey, why not revive cuneiform while you're at it?! And what would you like to see revived in the field of music, banging clubs on skulls? That must make such a uniquely <em>human</em> sound...

No, it's OK... I haven't read much of that other thread, and anyway it doesn't even matter what Legato does - it's just an instance. What matters is the concept of what we should be doing.

I just want people to know that resistance -passionate, furious resistance- exists; that there are people who can see that the emperor has become senile, and think it's important to point that out.

Let me repeat: "The consequent of my claims above is not that type design imitate writing."

You try to ban using the pen as a reference axis in handling or gauging type from type talk. Any time you see a reference to handwriting you smell a senile chirographic rat. I try to say the rat's not in my equation. 

I only think, in the context of this thread, abandoning handwriting writing is cultural suicide. Type-cultural suicide as well.

I try to make people think as well.

My concept of what we should be doing in type design is that, at least in the text-type domain, we should be exploring feature manipulation / norm-violations that promote or enhance rapid automatic visual wordform resolution in reading.</div>

A convenient alarmism. It <em>will</em> happen, but not
so abruptly. However, its wholesale abandonment
is indeed overdue in the field of text face design.

		<div class="commentbody">When children are young (like my niece) its not a matter of forcing the alfabet into them. They WANT to learn, they imitate letters even if they don't know their meaning yet. The get it wrong the first time, but quickly learn to get better. And the speed at which they learn and absorb things is amazing! So not learning handwriting to me is definately wrong! It's they drilling and the testing that's the problem, not the handwriting. Each kid has it's own pace to learn things, and are better in some things or  worse in others. This should be taken into account when teaching them. They aren't harddrives, for chrissakes! 

I cannot prove anything but I think it is essential to learn proper handwriting, because it trains the brain in a unique way (just like drawing does in it's own way). It's not just a matter of being able to decipher glyphs on a screen. Typing is also different than writing, not better or worse but different. I have nothing against teaching kids with modern tools, but this doesn't disqualify old methods. It's not a case of either/or but of and/and.

		<div class="commentbody">hi guys,

this has gotten way to contentious for me but i can't help myself.

does anyone know where and what the research is on the relationship between drawing, brain function and development?  i know it exists but i don't know where.  i don't think its in gardner's work but if someone could direct me it would be appreciated.

an abstract expressionist painter friend and i often discuss the relationship between gestural drawing and thinking.  he draws and paints and i write cursive with pencils and pens.  i do this in addition to spending too much time key stroking and pushing pixels around on the computer.

i flunked spelling in elementary school and my handwriting was illegible until it became my choice to write longhand.  until recently i hated both of these disciplines because i sucked at performing them, but mastering them expands my capabilities, stretches my brain and makes my communication skills more complex, useful and dynamic.

i know from personal experience that the product of my writing is different when i am on the computer and when i write a letter by hand.  its this gestural thing and also that, although marks made directly on paper are not immutable, correcting, changing or altering them takes a lot more effort than in the computer.  so, i think, the brain performs a different kind of editing in each mode.  and both have practical applications in an increasingly digital age.</div>

Sure, tools influence thinking. I think it's important to see that influence is there, and to fight it back, if necessary/wanted.
We're in the middle of a paradigm/generation shift IMHO. Getting back to type design (or design in general), I personally find it much easier to produce good design, smooth curves &c. on screen than with a pen on paper. On the other hand, many of my colleagues still believe there is some sort of brain&mdash;hand expressway. Both views coexist &ndash; the medial landscape *is* shifting. 
I wonder how long a majority will cling to the "old" ways.

It's comical to picture the not-too-distance past -and the not-too-distant future- where people did -and will do- just fine without authoring visible language by hand. In the future they will look back at us and laugh, just like we now laugh at pre-decimal counting systems, or pushing sticks into mud to remember stuff.

And what if the pencil breaks? I can't tell you how many times I've convinced my son to get a head start on his homework during the drive home only for him to discover that he has nothing to write with. And speaking of cars, what if you live in LA and your car stops working? Knowing to walk doesn't really help much. But frankly that line of reasoning goes nowhere.

And it's very telling that at the highest levels (Matthew Carter, Evert Bloemsma and others) type designers design directly onscreen. Simply because, through forward thinking and practice, they have overcome any prejudice towards the hand.

		<div class="commentbody">Nina: <em>Getting back to type design (or design in general), I personally find it much easier to produce good design, smooth curves &c. on screen than with a pen on paper.</em>

As do I, and I doubt if I am alone in practising type design as a compensation for bad handwriting. :)

As I explained to Hermann Zapf when showing him some of the diacritic letters I had made for the initial Apple version of Palatino (before Hermann and Akira decided the redraw the entire typeface from scratch), I know what the shapes should look like, but can't make them by hand with a pen in the way that he can.

But what is the skill that I am actually using when I'm designing type directly on the computer? I don't think it is a skill at moving my fingers on a trackball or cursor keys to edit bezier curves, although there is some basic manual competence involved. The skill is in looking and in understanding what I see. There is a difference of kind between the skill involved in making shapes on a computer and making shapes by hand, which has to do with the directness of the relationship between hand, tool and shape. What this means in terms of working with a pen or working with a computer is not that there is a switch between parallel but different skills -- since in the area of design the core skill, of seeing and understanding, remains the same regardless of the tool --, but whether a separate set of skills -- manual, fine motor skills, controlling a mark-making tool in direct contact with a medium -- is employed or bypassed. Or, in the case of education, whether these skills are developed at all.</div>

John, do I hear you. It's reassuring to hear you say that!
FWIW, when I started out designing my font, I spent about two months awkwardly sketching stuff on tracing paper that never looked right; my design process, the search for the shapes I wanted only took off once I put those sketches aside and moved to FontLab. 
So I'm always bewildered when people seem to think that analogue drawing skills are some sort of <em>sine qua non</em> for design in general. Especially nowadays.

<em>"The skill is in looking and in understanding what I see."</em>
That's a very good point. Of course béziers are a tool to be learned and understood too, but one that definitely favors brainpower over physical dexterity. I hear too many from the "hand-drawing fraction" say stuff like "only the hand can produce smooth curves". Well mine can't.

Which reminds me: "physical dexterity leads to mental dexterity", as has been stated in this thread, seems… well, let's say oversimplified at the very least, if not somewhat beside the point in the digital age. If I was thinking the way I can draw, I'd have an IQ of about 50.

<em>"What this means [is] whether a separate set of skills — manual, fine motor skills, controlling a mark-making tool in direct contact with a medium — is employed or bypassed. Or, in the case of education, whether these skills are developed at all."</em>
So do you think they should be [to the degree that they currently are]?</div>

nobody said physical dexterity was the _sole_ route
to mental dexterity.

and your i.q. -- to the extent there is such a thing --
is probably set by now.

but had you been _taught_ to draw as a youngster,
it might have raised your i.q. above what it is now.

one of the main sections in the i.q. test is one that
assesses ability to manipulate spatial dimensions...
(it's the one that shows drawings of pieces of paper
in various shapes, with fold-lines at certain places.)

that's why i suggested that things like origami and
knot-tying -- and even sudoku -- could be helpful...

it's also the case that _any_ form of _mastery_ can
help produce a positive mental state that can lead to
increased intellectual activity.  i was reminded of this
recently when reading a post by dave winer on his blog:
>   http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/25/iGetIdeasWhenISki.html

dave gets ideas when he goes skiing...

-bowerbird

p.s.  along a similar line, some common problems
in the learning of handwriting -- e.g., flipping letters,
either horizontally or vertically -- are also associated
with dyslexia and autism.

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, my take on child development is that children should be allowed to play, and most of the skills they need in this world will be developed as a result of play: the way you played with your mother's typewriter when you were four. I do think thank tactile, manual play is of primary importance, especially for very young children: direct engagement with objects, manipulating them, making them interact, etc. Manipulating things via indirect controls, such as using a computer, is of secondary importance and something that, developmentally, follows from the first and can't be a substitute for it.

I don't think there is any point in schooling children in e.g. Spencerian penmanship -- especially not if the tool you give them to do it with is a ballpoint pen! --, but I do think it is important for children to develop the fine motor skills that will enable them to learn that form of writing, or any other form that appeals to them, when they want to do so. I think there are a lot of people in the world who would love to make calligraphy, or even simply produce everyday handwriting that gives them pleasure, but who lack fundamental motor skills and this lack will make it very, very difficult for them to obtain even competence let along excellence.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This may be a bit off topic... It is rare lately that I write any thing with a pen or pencil. Even mundane notes, recipes, grocery lists are typed, so that I can save them in my computer without wasting paper. Sometimes, I need hard copy, such as the grocery list, so I might take the information with me. The side effect is that most of what I write is typeset. The zeitgeist of the near future may make paper even less necessary. I do not yet have a way to easily transfer text to my telephone, although many people do. 

It seems that a child today will transition to this medium much faster than I did; probably in elementary school.

If the only thing you care about is the resulting line in the given medium, then you might indeed wonder what is the difference. But it is the same difference that pertains between making love and looking at pornography on the Internet. If ejaculation is the only ‘result’ you are considering, then perhaps there is indeed no fundamental difference, but most people understand that there is in fact a considerable difference and more to one than to the other.</div>

I'm not in favour of ‘making’ children -- or adults, or dogs, or any other intelligent and social creature -- do anything, which is why I suggested at the beginning of this discussion that the problem was not handwriting but schooling. Drilling eight year-old children in the use of computer keyboards and subjecting them to tests of typing proficiency to meet state assessment standards isn't going to solve the problem, even if many children find using the computer keyboard easier than writing, i.e. less challenging. It won't make the children any happier to be told that their typing is bad rather than that their handwriting is bad.

Absolutely take children to the beach, give them clay to play with, sit beside them making lettershapes and see if they are curious about what you are doing. But first let them discover things about sand and clay, and then let them explore their curiosity about the media and their own ideas about what to do with it. They will naturally become curious about what you are doing, but only after they have satisfied their curiosity about their own minds' promptings. Some children will very quickly gravitate to what the adult is doing; others will spend a long time playing with their own ideas first.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that teaching handwriting (as in, the art of "make your letters look pretty") is stupid, letters just need to be legible, which is the curse of being a member of a society - others have to be able to understand your output.  But getting rid of teaching to write by hand period could end up being counterproductive in the maths and sciences.

Can you really imagine doing math equations typing out each new line?  While I can write papers much more fluidly on a computer,to work an equations or figure things out I just can't do it at a reasonable speed without pen and paper.

Also, dezcom, flipped letters are certainly normal, but normal in first grade.  By third grade, it's a sign of some other problem (dyslexia or others).

Nachos: I only remember having had handwriting when I first learned to write, and when I learnt cursive.  Other than that, we practiced through the normal English classes.  Re sports, trust me, you do use elements of sport in your real life, just maybe not the physical aspect of it.  I don't agree with how PE is implemented in the system at the moment but it serves a worthwhile purpose.

John: in my experience as a teacher, I've found that children whose parents expose them to the most ideas at home are the ones that most benefit from schooling.  Why?  Probably simply because the parents are there imposing the value of exploration and learning.  Few, if any, of my student's parents can read or speak English, but those that are involved in their kids lives (much like your description in the last paragraph) are those whose kids have the most advanced English because they see class as an exploration.  But those whose parents aren't in the picture see English as a chore like taking out the garbage.  Know that I do agree with you, above all re achievement tests, but children do need to have certain minimum levels (this doesn't require standardized tests of course).  I can let them count rocks for days on end but at some point they do need to learn multiplication.  And if they can't learn it, they need to brought back up to pace either via summer school, Saturday school, or being held back.

hrant, Having stopped reading comments a while back I may be off topic to what is currently being discussed. I understand your argument for reason and practicality yet people are not all so shrewd. You say if I am not mistaken that handwriting is obsolete and dated. I think you are overlooking that as much as it (handwriting) is a tool to make marks it has also come to carry meaning in itself. That being the case I don't think it ever will, nor should be abandoned. Legibility is not the end all in terms of communication, even in the world of typography. Characters can, especially in display, become more than just symbolic representations of letters in an alphabet. The forms can become a part of a gestalt that communicates beyond language. <a href="http://www.scriptsf.com/original/index.php">http://www.scriptsf.com/original/index.php</a></div>

Agreed. But basing this on the right hand holding a specific type

I understand ‘making’ someone do something to involve either forcing them against their will or hijacking their will, neither of which is good for that person and, crucially, <em>neither of which is an efficient way of getting a social creature to do anything</em>.

Over the past two and a half years I've learned a lot of important things about social creatures and how they are best motivated to do things. Most of this I learned from my dog, who is a more consistent teacher than any I had in school.

One of the things I've learned is that if a more intelligent species can't motivate, in a positive way, a less intelligent species to do something, the problem is with the more intelligent species not the less intelligent one. The same holds true for more mature and presumably intelligent adults vis à vis children: if an adult has to force a child to do something against his or her will, there's a problem with the adult not with the child.</div>

I'm sorry if I was unclear. I was using the example of a gestalt generally. I think that the tool you use, should be selected based on the product that you desire. When you want the hand to be present in a letterform I see no need to try to mimic that in any other  way than to begin drawing the forms on paper with your chosen tool whether it be pen, pencil, brush or whatever. Historically the abandonment of a tool has shown a degradation in the particular forms that it produces. It was only with much effort and research that <a href="http://www.ejf.org.uk/">Edward Johnson</a> was able to revive the broad edged pen as a tool for writing. Sometimes the best tool and method is the one that has been around the longest.</div>

John, the higher cognitive ability and moral understanding of children, beyond very early stages, makes parenting have many different challenges from raising a dog. 

Young children tend to follow what parents want. However, they also have their likes and dislikes and want to test limits, so it is complicated, and that makes parenting challenging. 

There are also times when you should coerce a child. When they are about to walk into danger, you pick them up, and carry them away, maybe with them screaming and kicking. Same with buying still more candy.

Also with your own goals as a parent, there are conflicts. You want the child to develop his or her individuality, but not to the extent of growing up to be a nasty, selfish person. Children, as with all humanity, have good and bad tendencies, and parents ideally construct in their home a world in which good habits and attitudes will flourish and the bad be curbed.</div>

Also this may be something that only applies to those with dyslexia, but it may also be helpful as a learning stage for all children. And if hand movement remains as a basic layer in our brains, it would argue that the 'moving front' of a stroke in a letter is a basic feature that we shouldn't ignore in letter design as well. </div>

“Agreed. But basing this on the right hand holding a specific type
of marking tool is very near-sighted, especially when it comes to
the <em>purpose</em> of rendering visible language: reading it!” [Hrant]

In my opinion the larger purpose of rendering language visible is to increase the legibility of the world (Abraham Moles). We do this by reading the texts of others and writing or transcribing texts ourselves. Reading is not <em>the purpose</em> but an affordance of rendering language visible. Our latin script, especially in its lower case <em>is</em> based on the right hand holding a specific marking tool. This has nothing to do with being nearsighted. It is in fact derivative, circumstantial and fortuitous. It facilitated the evolution of a comfortably writable and broadly readable script.

The domain of type design is feature manipulation, and evolution proceeds through norm-violation (read chapter 10 of Douglas Hofstadter's <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</em>: “Esthetic Perception and Creative Play in the Rich Microcosm of the Alphabet.”). In this domain, what the reading body needs exerts a countervailing pressure to what the writing or sculpting or pixel and bezier-manipulating or keyboard mapping body wants. 

The reading system resolves or decomposes marks on paper or images on screen into role-units, and fully or partially enclosed counters into evoked forms. The pattern (location and perceptual identity) of these is what is read. Writing inscribes this decomposition into the visual cortex. 

If the marks don't have a distinctive and independent cue value in their context, or the evoked forms aren't salient enough in the context of the whole, the rapid automatic visual word-from resolution grounding sense-following in reading suffers. This means three things are important for reading. Gestalt integrity, or notan; well-formedness and narrow phase alignment when it comes to the marks; and well-formedness and synchronization when it comes to the evoked forms. Writing teaches well-formedness, phase alignment and synchronization. Notan, proper salience and independent cue value impel us to press beyond.</div>

1) I didn't know you were focusing on dyslexics. Why?
2) How do you know this?
3) Maybe it's because our fonts suck?

Not for the reader.
In fact not for most writers either!

One must remember that the broad nib's pen was broad simply because the technology for making clean and permanent monoline marks wasn't available for a very long time*. But that hasn't been true since before any of us were even born. And ironically the fact that virtually nobody writes with a broad-nib pen anymore seems to make no dent into some people's wishful thinking.

* In fact one must believe that stroke contrast was an undesirable compromise, since it's certainly not intuitive. Monoline is much more intuitive  - in fact <em>that's how <strong>everybody</strong> is <strong>taught</strong> to write</em>. It's really quite annoying to witness such broad and deep denialism concerning this reality.

> It is in fact derivative, circumstantial and fortuitous.

Yes, yes, no.

> It facilitated the evolution of a comfortably
> writable and broadly readable script.

Your benchmarks of comfort and breadth
have to be quite low for you to believe this.

> Writing teaches well-formedness, phase alignment and synchronization.

I don't see any of that.
And frankly it sounds like post-rationalized chiro-apologism.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, of course raising a child is different from raising a dog, because humans are more psychologically complex than dogs. But this is precisely why understanding the behaviour of simpler social creatures can be important, because the complexity of human beings often masks a lot of basic damage and even leads people to overlook or misinterpret behaviour that, in a simpler creature, we would immediately recognise as symptomatic of stress, fear and defensive aggression. Further, because we are the objects of our own observation, we tend to excuse as personality differences things that in simpler creatures we would recognise as pathologies.

<em>There are also times when you should coerce a child. When they are about to walk into danger, you pick them up, and carry them away, maybe with them screaming and kicking.</em>

Of course, just as you physically prevent a dog from running in front of a car. But in such situations you are not forcing the child to do something: you are doing something to the child to prevent the child from doing something. This is an important distinction. You are the active agent. You are intervening in the situation. When you are not intervening in a situation, you are normally managing it, which is something that parents should be doing in all the time. You manage the situation to protect the child from danger and also to provide the kind of learning opportunities that are important for the child's development. This is why I believe that a kind of school is a good thing: a managed environment in which children can learn. But there is a big difference between managing the situations within which children act and forcing them to perform specific tasks against their will.

On something close to a daily basis, I witness people abusing their dogs. They don't know they they're abusing them, and they think they have a normal human-to-dog relationship that consists of pulling and pushing the dog, yelling at it, half throttling it, and expecting the dog to be 'well-behaved' because the human has a power over it. Sorry to say it, but a lot of people raise children in the same way, and a lot of what passes for ‘education’ in our school systems is based on the same approach (just as such abuse is institutionalised in some dog training, contrary to all science on animal behaviour and motivation).

What I wrote above was that making a social creature do something against its will is not an <em>efficient</em> way to achieve the result. It isn't immediately efficient because it requires intermediary steps of breaking down the resistant will rather than motivating the will in a new direction, and it isn't efficient in the long term because the diminishment of trust and affection is contrary to the desired relationship between social creatures. Put simply, love and fear are incompatible emotions. Sadly, a lot of children fear their parents more than they love them, just as more fear school than love it. So the question is not simply whether it is morally right to use intimidation, humiliation, or violence to force another creature to do something that you want it to do, but whether it is worth using such methods? Whether they can be truly considered effective in terms of the larger goals of developing healthy social relationships?

When I see someone jerking their dog's leash, or a parent shouting at a child, or a teacher humiliating a child, I don't think 'Oh dear, what's wrong with that dog or that child?', I wonder what is wrong with the adult human. Often the answer is that the person is tired, stressed and as a result impatient. But how we treat other social creatures shouldn't be based on our own level of patience or impatience, and we should not create institutions with built-in impatience (‘All children must meet these state assessment standards by the end of this term.’).</div>

Mono-line is only more intuitive to the novice. Is it more readable as well?

And the Reader is a novice chirographer! Especially the Left-Handed Reader. There are millions of times as many left-handers using a ball-point pen than there are right-handers using a broad-nib pen. What does that imply about what people are used to?

Of course. And it makes the most sense when you leverage it without being shackled by chirography, when you incorporate stroke contrast for its benefits, not because of what cozy place it comes from.

What makes most sense is to make a clean break. When you go on a maritime adventure, simply leave the doddering grandpa at home.

Introduction? It just happened. Which is the sort of arbitrariness I oppose, but you adopt or reject apparently motivated solely by a desire to avoid sending the senile demigod to an old folks home.

Most type designers, just like any other majority, simply mimic precedent. Do you really believe most of them incorporate stroke contrast because they think it promotes readability? Ridiculous. Most of them don't even know why serifs help readability. No Peter, they do it for the same reason you push chirography: "My pappy did it that way."

> Why does stroke contrast make sense for reading?

The answer is right in there: contrast!  :-)

Oh, so "stroke" contrast is linked to degree of detail and wealth of information? OK. But how does a contrasted "m" communicate more "m-ness" than a monoline "m"?

That's a distinction without a difference. You are forcing the child to go one direction rather than another, and it is brute force coercion. It's just that it's responsible parenting, and doesn't involve pain. 

As I was saying, it's a lot more complicated, but beyond our scope here. 

>stroke contrast

There are some different issues here. One is using contrast to counteract the eye's seeing something different from what's on the page, which it does all the time. As Chris says, a mono-line join looks thicker. Horizontals the same thickness as a vertical look thicker. Even vertical division looks low, etc. etc. The best example here is Futura, which is way different from geometrical in order to look geometrical.

The other question is when obvious, apparent contrast is at work--such as in most serif type, or stressed sans like Optima. There it does seem to help readability, but I really don't understand it.

It may not, but it is part of a system of signs that, used together, seem to benefit from stroke contrast. The most obvious readability benefit I see to consistent use of stroke contrast across letters, regardless of the degree to which specific letters benefit from it internally, is that this produces consistent spatial frequency. Since both eye and brain need to adapt to changes in spatial frequency, being able to maintain consistent spatial frequency in text gives the reader less work, meaning he or she can read more quickly and comfortably.

Spatial frequency also explains how it is possible to have, on the one hand not enough contrast -- and hence few opportunities to modulate spatial frequency of various shapes --, and on the other hand too much contrast à la the more extreme 19th century types -- and hence too great a variation in spatial frequency within the letters, causing them to break apart perceptually.

Yes William, this was the case I was wondering about. I agree it seems to read better, and with less effort &ndash; but why…?

John, about this "spatial frequency": does this refer to the stressing of a kind of repetitive (but varied) <em>pattern</em> stretching across different letters? Ahh, I think I can see how that might connect multiple letters to words. Whereas with monoline faces, the letters are maybe less visually connected to one another (there's less of an overall pattern forming). Does this make sense? Am I on to something? :)</div>

I don't think we really know for sure, but in addition to what others posted, let me offer this: the contrast styling typical of translation facilitates diversification of counter shapes in pdbq and other pairs. As well, I could hypothesize that contrast places accents on the criterial bits for resolving or decomposing complex marks into simple role units. It is as if the thins mark off role-unit boundaries in a way the visual cortex can use. My context for this is the supposition that selective activation of a criterial set of role units in their pattern cues rapid automatic visual word-form resolution. I also believe monoline forms are too static and self contained. Contrast creates tensive forms that are dynamic and reach out to other adjacent forms to bring the larger bounded forms they collectively compose to some kind of closure.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, I've been looking for a clear, basic definition of spatial frequency, but have not found one. Here is a good introduction to the optical effects associated with spatial frequency though:
http://www.yorku.ca/eye/spafreq.htm

And here is a very interesting paper on the role of spatial frequency channels in letter recognition:
http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/majaj2002channel.pdf

The key finding vis à vis my comments on typographic contrast, as expressed in the conclusion of the above paper, is

<cite>For each alphabet, font, and size, letter identification
is mediated by a single one-or-two-octave-wide visual
channel. Even in the presence of very asymmetric noise
distributions, observers continue using the same channel
to identify and detect letters and gratings. Together,
these two findings say that the channel is selected bottom-
up by the signal, not top-down by the observer.</cite>

From this it follows that if the signal changes significantly between letters, then a different channel must be selected. The paper's authors were testing changes in signal based on switching fonts and changing text size, but obviously such changes presume that a single font in a single size has a fairly uniform signal, which is what we would expect in a well designed typeface. Kevin Larson suggested to me that this might begin to explain why typographic contrast is beneficial, and I'm starting to understand this in terms of using stroke contrast to modulate and harmonise the signal of different letter shapes.

Designing Cyrillic letters is revelatory in this regard, as the variety of letter proportions is more varied than in Latin, and hence greater variety of stroke weight is necessary to compensate for the overall density of the letters.</div>

You've made exactly the best observation here. Stroke contrast would be ideal when detached from chirography; it should emphasize what each letter needs (although not in terms of making it stand out, but rather making it participate ideally in bouma formation). Some people -like Javal- have tried making test fonts like this, but they haven't had sufficient overall design sensitivity.

This is a good way to think about it.

I think there are two requirements here: participation in bouma formation and ready decomposability into role-units. Reading is of wholes and mediated by quantization of glyphic information into letter parts. I think Hrant’s functional ontology of reading ignores the latter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, the idea that the fovea is the domain of letter recognition and that the parafovea is the domain of bouma based reading is precisely where we disagree. 

I believe parafoveal preview assembles accurate but coarse-grained ensemble statistics to facilitate rapid automatic visual wordform (bouma) resolution on the bases of selective quantization of a criterial amount of letter parts in the fovea. In other words I think what happens relative to foveal vision in the visual cortex in immersive reading is massively boama based, that is, oriented to resolving the gestalt in all its detail and particularity. I think the 2/3 falls the other way. Short, syntactically and grammatically expected words require little more than the parafoveal preview.

This fundamental disagreement lies at the heart of the differences in understanding between you and me.</div>

There are two reasons your theory can't be right:
1) Average saccade lengths are about triple the fovea's span.
2) The fovea's resolution is very high; and visual cognition identifies numerous individual letters in parallel much faster than lexical analysis can be performed. Ergo: there's no reason to worry about boumas/notan/serifs/contrast/anything in the fovea (this being Larson's stance). The parafovea is what makes or breaks a text font.

> Short, syntactically and grammatically expected

This parafoveal "previewing" is entirely half-baked, and cannot make sense in any model of reading. With reading experience much more than "from", etc. can be "guessed" - and the point is guesswork is exactly how reading becomes immersive. Without guesswork you're effectively limited to the fovea. And regressions are failures in guesswork - but in essence you're not going fast enough if you don't fail sometimes.

Your model ignores large swathes of evidence, not to mention plain logic. To be brutally honest the only thing it seems to satisfy is your desire to prop up certain pre-existing beliefs; beliefs that perhaps you didn't recognize when you first embarked on this adventure, but that nonetheless were apparently bound to take control of your conclusions in the end. This is not an attack, but advice: you should realize that there cannot be any real exploration within the safe confines of your father's house.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, we’ve been over this before, an you and I are in a stale-mate.

1) Your estimate of the foveal span is conveniently narrow. Most estimates of the form resolving field or the uncrowded span where vision is sharp give it the length of a four to six letter word at text sizes.

2) In your second point you’ve capitulated to the conventional understanding of how perceptual processing during foveation works when vision is confronted with word-gestalts or visual informational bounded maps. I am swimming against the stream when it comes to this. I take my cue from Frank Smith in his 1967 dissertation, and more recently from the work of Chad Marsolek and Joseph Devlin. You are rowing against the stream of prevailing wisdom when it comes to the capabilities of the parafovea. On the one hand there are those who say letters are used to 15 character spaces from fixation. On the other hand there are those who say, on the basis of their data, that crowding is so severe with normal letter spacing in the parafovea that feature identification and intgration is massively error prone. No one, not even Herman Bouma believes that the bulk of immersive reading occurs inside the parafovea. The eye, during immersive reading fixates within at least 2/3 of the words within a text. More when articles and conjunctions are discounted.

The father thing is entirely a red herring, and the earlier insinuations about demagogary and senility are downright manipulative and cruel. Should I retaliate? I came to this in 1999 with an Noordzijian a priori. What predisposed me toward that was a preoccupation — that goes back to the 1970s — with the “phenomenology of perception.” My a priori is the idea that it is the word-image, which includes it's black and white components, that is read. This, as I was to find out, also goes back to an early consensus among psychologists. This is what was behind my attraction to the bouma concept. My respect for Noordzij’s type-analytic framework is secondary to this. The idea that the domain of type design is open-ended feature manipulation is my own, and the idea that this involves norm-violation and aggregation relative to what is already in existence, and might lead to new benchmarks comes from Douglas Hofstadter and Manuel De Landa. The idea that interpreting action or ideas in terms of clean binary oppositions is pernicious comes from Derrida, and my distaste for George Bush and what he represents. So you see, I have many fathers. And all have important things to say.

I do not ignore swathes of evidence. I am deeply, critically and creatively engaged with stacks of recent and not so recent studies. And in the domain of how vision, neural transmission and the visual cortex works your plain logic is not as compelling as you suppose or a substitute for continued exploration.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, what a fascinating thread. I don't really want to interrupt the current sub-thread, but let me quickly sneak this in:

Thanks for shedding some light on the contrast issue. Peter, your point of diversification is well taken &ndash; at least in the case of the bdpq and similars; though I'm not sure if letters like, say, nmu don't get even *more* similar at least in the case of traditional/pen-based contrast being applied, since that stresses mostly the verticals, which seem to be exactly one feature that is pretty much <em>the same</em> across different lettershapes?

<em>"As well, I could hypothesize that contrast places accents on the criterial bits for resolving or decomposing complex marks into simple role units. It is as if the thins mark off role-unit boundaries in a way the visual cortex can use."</em>
Interesting! But would this mean that the "heavier" parts are inherently more crucial as "building blocks" for the "correct" perception of a letter-(/word-)shape, while the thins mainly serve to mark the boundaries between them? &ndash; But then why should, say, in a "W", the "downwards" diagonals be more crucial in making the letterform what it is, than the "upwards" diagonals? Is that just a pattern thing?

<em>"Stroke contrast would be ideal when detached from chirography; it should emphasize what each letter needs"</em>
This seems so logical. Hrant, is Javal's work in this respect documented somewhere?
… I guess at the same time you also need some sort of visual pattern (and not just have functionally important, but visually random-looking parts stressed)?

Speaking of patterns, thank you John for the spatial frequency related input. I'll admit it is utterly and completely over my head at the moment; I'm going to have to let it sink in a bit. But I did notice that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency">Wikipedia entry</a> mentions that the discrimination of spatial frequencies is often lacking in dyslexics, which might be interesting.</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EyeFixationsReading_6193.gif]

.
As you can see--and you can test it for yourself with the image--while the foveal vision is 100% sharp at 4-5 letters, according to this, it is 75% sharp for 8-12 letters. Now I'm assuming that this is not step-wise, but smooth fall-off, so that the average saccade being 7-8 letters means that most reading can take place within the span where the fovea can distinguish sub-letter parts. 

So putting this information on what the fovea sees together with the information from 2007 book I cite above, it seems that the evidence here goes with Peter's view, and contradicts Hrant's. Do you have some other sources, Hrant?  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Following up a reference in the Wikipedia article I read about a [[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6983176.stm|fascinating study]] which found that when we read we don't fixate on the same letter with both eyes. Instead, each eye fixates on a letter typically two letters away from the other. This would extend the "100% sharp" area two more letters, so the 100% sharp area is 6-7 letters. This puts the average 7-8 letter saccade almost all in the most sharp area of focus, and the rest within an only slightly deteriorated sharpness. 

Chris, it does look like long words pose a problem. It may be that German readers fixate more than once on a long word.

[Thanks for the acuity image, Bill. This is a very helpful reference point.]

I've been thinking about the perceptual difference between a static fixation and a saccadic fixation, the phenomenal difference being, of course, duration and movement. A saccadic fixation is one of a series of such fixations, and I think it is important to realise that this means that the parafoveal region between the fixations is seen not one but twice: from either side. And if both these views of words in the parafovea contribute to word recognition, then the overall acuity is higher than it would be of the same region in a static fixation.

Even presuming a longer than average saccade of 10 letters, using the acuity image that Bill posted as a reference, one can see that a second saccadic fixation after the illustrated one, falling in the first part of the word 'letters', would mean that, seen from both sides, perception of the intervening letters would all have approx. 75% acuity or higher. This is 'reading in the parafovea' that I can accept.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, psychologists have various terms for what happens in parafoveal vision. Some talk about compulsory averaging of feature-based information, others talk about pooling because of crowding. I tend to think there is an inhibition of quantization (resolution into role-units) because of the density of rods and cones in parafoveal vision, that prevents rapid automatic visual wordform resolution, but allows indexing of what's to come, and the affords gathering of some kind of accurate ensemble statistics which goes beyond envelope structure. Maybe it has to do with pre-designating where criterial areas lie on the bases of, or the pre-designation of salient centres. It’s a dark area.</div>

Nick, the article explains that the blurring is a simulation, and not what we see. The blur just indicates the degradation in the information available to us as we move away from the center of fixation. But just testing by fixating one eye, you can see it's a pretty good simulation. 

I was also struck that 50% of the optic nerve receptors of the eye are in the small area of the fovea. Given that also probably most of the information to the right of the foveal fixation (reading left-to-right text) is detected by the left half of the eye, Hrant's view that the parafovea is paramount would be a very inefficient way of reading.  

And, according [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration|to this article on macular degeneration]] those whose central vision area has been destroyed by disease, while leaving the parafovea functional, *cannot read*. That seems to me to refute Hrant's theory--if I understand it rightly--that reading is primarily a due to the activity of the parafovea. </div>

I didn't really mean "average", sorry (although even the average is more than the fovea's span). What I meant was the long end. Concerning which that Wikipedia article tellingly states: "The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters."

20! So maybe I was wrong about 2/3-rds... I should have said 80%!

		<div class="commentbody">Peter: <em>John, are you suggesting there’s an uptake of information during a saccade?</em>

No, absolutely not. I'm pointing out that during fixations we do not only have a parafoveal preview of the text ahead -- enabling cuing of the next fixation -- but was also have a parafoveal <em>review</em> of the letters between the last fixation and the present one. This, <em>to the degree that acuity permits,</em> provides the opportunity to confirm identification of cue features in this region. Since acuity is highest closer to the foveal fixation, this means that the perception of preceding letters immediately to the left of the new fixation is more accurate than the perception of the same letters during the previous fixation. This is illustrated in the image below (without attempting to illustrate the acuity diminishment by blurring):

And note that these are unusual. Most are much shorter, consistent with reading in the fovea being the main thing. In your view, it seems to me, most should be much longer, as we are using the parafovea so much anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">“Please think deeply — and coolly — about what that implies.” [Hrant]

Ok, so we’ve had our bedtime story and presumably we have a good night’s rest and a hearty, nutritious breakfast.

The question is: how much uptake, and what kind of uptake (foveal or parafoveal) of visual information does it take too stay robustly connected with the unfolding thread of sense ensconced in the written text. For context let me quote what Marilyn Jager Adams says [1991]: “the dynamics of visual information uptake are shown [by eye-movement studies] to be quite tightly bound to the print on the page even as they are complexly influenced by top-down factors”

On Hrant’s logic 80 percent of the uptake can be parafoveal.
Question: doesn’t that claim mean 80 percent of all the visual information is not rendered 100 percent sharply, and do you wish to imply that this implies 80 percent of all the words need not be fixated in?
Question: is it sound deductive practice to base estimates of what normally happens, or, in the best of all possible worlds, what can happen, on upper thresholds?
Question: how often and under what circumstances does a saccade hit the upper threshold?
Question: when it hits 20, what is skipped: prepositional phrases, auxiliary information or key words, i.e., highly anticipatable textual information, assuming that at least to some degree reading is a “psycho-linguistic guessing game?”
Question: when saccades are average, what is skipped: conjunctions, prepositions, articles, prefixes, suffixes, declentional markers, morphemic add-ons, what else?
Question: counting regressive saccades, in a typical text how many words are actually skipped?</div>

For macular degeneration provides a crucial test: it knocks out the vision of the fovea and leaves the vision of the parafovea intact. And those who suffer from this horrible ailment can't read. So 80% of reading can't be in the parafovea. End of story.

Hrant, facts are stubborn things. They don't bend to bend to you or I, or to name-calling and attempts to belittle the person who points them out.   

The fact is that macular degeneration destroys the ability to read. 

If your understanding of these matters is so superior, then you can easily explain where I have gone wrong in interpreting what seems to me the plain message of a disease that destroys the ability to read by disabling the only fovea, and not the parafovea: the parafovea is not of dominant importance in reading. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the interest of bringing this roilling and and sometimes rollicking subthread to some kind of resolution, let me offer this.

Type design <em>must</em>, at least somewhere / in some of it’s prominent manifestations, aggressively engage in post-chirographic exploration, rather than staying only with chiro-derivative refinement, deconstruction, reconstruction and elaboration.

Notes: 1) I mean <em>post</em>, not doctrinally </em>anti</em>; 2) the reason for my saying this is that we do not yet know to what degree, or just why the contrast-styling typical of the broad-nibbed pen (with or without rotation and expansion) or the flexible pointed brush appears to be advantageous, but we think it is, even though we strongly suspect that improving the notanic constituency of words might be more achievable by breaking out of it in much more systematic and fundamental ways than have been exercised so far; 3) there are compelling perceptual-processing reasons to retain <em>some kind of</em> a contrapuntal link between opposing control-point locations on vectors forming outlines no matter how distant from translation, translation with rotation, and expansion they might be, and there are compelling perceptual-processing reasons to violate strict frontal arithmetic for the sake of gestalt-enhancing notan.  My hypothesis is that both benefit both foveal uptake of words as boumas or gestalts and paravoveal indexing of words as informationally replete and unitary objects. They are countervailing pressures, based on the fact that perception is of wholes and relative to parts.

We need to do this because of what it might yield.

		<div class="commentbody">John, I wrote “must” because because we owe it to ourselves: one of the countervailing pressures pushes in that direction. It might yield to an even tighter bouma in gestalt or optical grammatical terms — that is a bounded map that resists componental decomposition into, or inhibits slot-processing via, independent letters units.

Perhaps the distinction between ‘derivative’ and ‘post’ is that ‘derivative’ feature manipulation is intuitive, incidental, sometimes not fully conscious of the frontal constituency of it's base or the logic of it's norm violations, and hence ad hoc; while ‘post’ is aware, analytically grounded, structurally basic and systematic. The problem with the incidental and ad hoc is that it can be contaminated with aesthetically preferential a priori. The proper concerns of type design are the optical-grammatical and the gestural-atmospheric.

This is somewhat on the fly. I'm trying to forge a new consensus. For what it’s worth.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Your critique of derivative featural manipulation is good, but I think the problem goes deeper than chiro-derivative design; indeed, I would say that the discernable chirographic derivation is largely an historical accident rather than essential to the phenomenon of derivation. The fact is that the vast majority of type design can and largely has been built on derivation of past-practice: that past-practice has itself been derived from chirographic models, but it needn't have been so. Imagine that Gutenberg had not decided to emulate textura manuscript forms, and instead had invented an entirely new form of typographic letter and that this had been successful in terms of cultural and functional acceptance by readers. The subsequent history of typeface design could still have been largely derivative of past practice. Evidence for this can be found in the fact that a great many designers do not look at type as chirographically derived, instead stressing a distinctively typographic history independent of the pen (locally, Bill Berkson is usually the most vocal representative of this view), yet still rely heavily on past-practice as the guiding principle of typeface design.

<em>The problem with the incidental and ad hoc is that it can be contaminated with aesthetically preferential a priori. The proper concerns of type design are the optical-grammatical and the gestural-atmospheric.</em>

...and the cultural-aesthetic. I don't think there are any grounds for reducing the concerns of type design to the optical-grammatical and gestural-atmospheric (not quite sure what you mean by atmospheric, though). I would agree if reading were such a difficult thing that all attention had to be paid to optimising shapes for legibility and readability. But reading isn't difficult, and as a result all writing systems -- in both typographic and chirographic form -- have tended toward cultural-aesthetic expression (not to be confused with the kind of individual expression against which Hrant rails), i.e. expression of shared ideas and ideals about attractive form married to the <em>prerequisite</em> function of text. We don't only want text to be readable, we also want it to be visually inviting and to reflect, in its form, broader ideas in our culture. There have certainly been times in history when the cultural-aesthetic concerns of type design have taken too great prominence and undermined the prerequisite functionality: the post-romantic Victorian types tended to this. But aesthetic decadence is a cultural phenomenon, and it is better to recognise it and work through it than to say that the cultural-aesthetic concern should be banished altogether.

So the problem I see with incidental and ad hoc feature manipulation isn't ‘contamination with aesthetically preferential a priori’, but the tendency to rely on past practice rather than conscious understanding of what one is doing. Ironically, at least in Hrantian terms, it is Noordzij's stroke model analysis that first suggested to me a new kind of consciousness in type design: an understanding of letter shapes from the inside-out, rather than from what you might call historico-conventional derivation. And I think this consciousness -- what we can call para-chirographic consciousness -- is itself only recently bearing fruit in type design and, by virtue of its consciousness, invites post-chirographic response. So I see the para-chirographic and the post-chirographic as parallel directions, both characterised by a from-within consciousness in shape making.</div>

Well, since being proved spectacularly wrong by you, James Mosley and others on thread about Baskerville and the pointed pen, I um, qualified my views. I still think a lot type design is influenced by and in reaction against past type. But changes in writing instruments are also still an influence. Today we have types influenced by the brush, by felt tip pens (Mark Simonson's Felt Tip) and by routers used for cutting signs (Olsen's Bryant), for example.  </div>

It's funny how that happens. My own dive into alphabet reform was triggered by the book "Counterpunch", where a modification to the "j" was suggested; and shortly afterwards I thought I saw an "a" facing the wrong way... except it wasn't, but then it was like being let out of a cage. Even though Smeijers cannot be accused of favoring my views at all!
