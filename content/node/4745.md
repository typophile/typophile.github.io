  body: Adam could we have some background about the newspaper? Who will it reach?
    How wide a community?

  body: It is about 100,000-150,000 people. The audience is kind of split actually.
    It is right between a college area and a new booming area of town. So there will
    be a focus on content for a younger crowd &#40;18-28&#41; and an older crowd with
    children who are in school. <BR> <BR>The paper is being introduced to fill a gap
    in the reporting from the local metro daily which doesn&#39;t have the ability
    to cover the area as well as a small community paper will. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>A

  body: 'Sorry for all the questions, one more though, what is the tone of the writing?
    Is it hip, flip and young or is it like Dragnet: Just the facts. Editoral tone
    might help narrow the field down a bit.'

  body: Questions are great...  It is going to be a mix. The main portion of the paper
    is going to be more towards the Joe Friday &#40;Just the facts&#41; approach.
    At times almost an upbeat approach to presenting news since it is a community
    paper. There will obviously be a more hip section for the paper since it is so
    close to a college campus. The paper also is venturing to be a watch-dog for the
    community &#40;as I think most papers should do anyway&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hope that
    clarifies the tone a little better. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>A

  body: Adam look at a Foundry rather than a specific face. Go over to Font Bureau,
    they create alot of text faces for newspapers and magazines. You might want to
    use one font for the front section and another for the hip section. I like FB
    Village quite alot, readable with some interesting characters. FB Miller is nice
    too. For the funkier section you might use a san serif face like FB Hermes or
    FB Benton Gothic. What ever you choose they all have a wide range of weights.
