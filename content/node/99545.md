  body: "@ Dick: Logically, the only way you can stretch or squoosh letters is horizontally.
    If you want to make letters taller and skinnier, you don't stretch them vertically.
    You increase the point size and squoosh them horizontally.\r\n\r\nThe proper terms
    are \"expand\" and \"condense,\" not \"stretch\" and \"squoosh,\" but since \"expanded\"
    and \"condensed\" can refer to other versions created by the designer of the font,
    I prefer to say \"horizontally scaled\" when I'm talking about a modification
    done in a page layout or drawing program. \r\n\r\nWhen I see horizontal scaling
    carried to an extreme, the term I usually use is \"cruelly distorted.\""
