  or Delire a Deux (A Frenzy for Two or More) for a major project/research assignment
  but am having trouble finding books and information, apart from a few articles that
  have tiny images of a few spreads\r\n\r\n\"type as voice\" massin distorted type
  to distinguish soft and loud conversation. most of his work was done in the 60's
  so it might pay for me to find something a bit more modern anyway, (am also looking
  at Tomatos Skyscraper which was done in 1994) so was just wondering if anyone knows
  of any work or designers that have done work similar to Massin?\r\n"

    it even farther. The Project was calles something along the lines of <cite>Visualisierung
    von Sprache [Visualization of Language]</cite> and was covered in detail in <cite>Typografische
    Monatsbl\xE4tter 2/2002</cite>. The project transformed acoustic signals of spoken
    language into visual signals that directly affected type: Filters were applied
    directly to type based on spoken language."
