  body: "Congrats, Toby!  I followed Enzo's development closely on Typophile (then
    known as <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/32881\">Zai</a>) and I'm pleased
    to see it released as a FontFont. We'll be sending the newsletter announcing the
    release in a few weeks. \r\n\r\nWe're still fixing some snags in the Advanced
    Character Set viewer which will reveal all your lovely ligatures and such on each
    font page. It will be up and running soon. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InDesignScreenSnapz002_5055.gif]"
