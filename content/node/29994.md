body: "Please help me decide between these three versions. Any criticism would be
  greatly appreciated also.\r\n\r\nVersion #1 is the initial concept, with the wordmark
  letter shapes intending to resemble carabiners. The triangular shape proved a bit
  too awkward to work with however, and thus version #2 was conceived. To add a little
  humanist aesthetic and visual interest, the horizontals of the wordmark were slightly
  thinned for version #3.\r\n\r\nI am worried that the initial concept might have
  been lost throughout this process of refinement (was it even obvious in the first
  place?).\r\n\r\nMEC stands for Mountain Equipment Co-op. For those not in the know,
  they're Canada's largest outdoor gear retailer.\r\n\r\nThanks! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/mec-typophile001_5416.png]"

  body: "I prefer version 2, but I find the mountain icon a little ambiguous it could
    be mistaken for a hat, maybe having the peaks at different heights could help,
    the radius of the corners seems a bit too much, you could introduce the carabiner
    theme by using an open carabiner as a lowercase e, you needn't change the shape
    of the sides of the character. I also feel that with the counters being so closed
    your kerning could almost be equal spaces.\r\nTim "

  body: "I also vote for #2. #3 looks a little over designed; the letterforms have
    an overwrought technical feel that seems very 1999 while #2 takes itself less
    seriously which I find more appropriate for the subject. \r\n\r\n I think the
    problem in the mountains is the size of the curve in the middle\u2014it disappears
    at small sizes and the concept is dead on, but at larger sizes there's something
    going on between the two peaks and that big negative space that doesn't work so
    well. "

  body: "Thanks for the feedback and suggestions, <strong>timd</strong> and <strong>jpad</strong>!\r\n\r\nI
    have incorporated <strong>timd</strong>'s suggestion regarding the E and you can
    see it in action below, next to a rendering of the original. What do you guys
    think? I've also made the kerning equal between the letters.\r\n\r\nI've also
    tried a few quick comps with the peaks at different heights, but that didn't go
    too well. I've also played around with the curves a bit, with similarly discouraging
    results.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what else I can do about the peaks. I would like
    to keep them symmetrical, since they form the negative shape of the letter M (with
    stems slightly apart). At the same time, I feel the symmetry does look a bit static
    and boring and not exactly representative of the excitement of outdoor activities.

      time to mock it up.\r\n\r\nGood point about the endings. I had tried the rounded
      endings as well during my earlier process, but I wasn't entirely happy with
      the results. They made the counters too tight for my liking and made the letters
      a tad too predictable. I think I like the rectangular endings more as they create
      a little bit of variation between the rounded corners and the sharp edges.\r\n\r\nI
      would be happy to hear other opinions on <strong>cannon46</strong>'s suggestion,
      however."

    from 2.2\r\n\r\nAs for the mark, it doesn't 'scream' mountains to me, but as an
    abstraction, I think it works fine. \r\n\r\nI think I also prefer the squared
    ends rather than the rounded ones, even though they contrast with the mark."

  body: "Thank you all for the feedback so far, I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nBased
    on the comments received, it seemed to be a tie between 2.2 and 2.3. I really
    like 2.2 because it does indeed resemble a climbing carabiner more than anything
    else, but in the end I think I'll end up going with 2.3 for legibility's sake
    (I've had a comment from a non-designer that the 'e' in 2.2 doesn't look like
    an 'e' because of its open counter).\r\n\r\nI've done some more renditions based
    on the comments received. 2.3.1 is a variation of 2.3 with rounded corners. I
    took <strong>timd</strong>'s suggestion into account and rounded just the corners
    rather than the whole terminals. 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 are based on <strong>cannon46</strong>'s
    suggestion to compress the text (I did keep the old shapes however).\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure whether I find any of these new variations more effective than the old
    ones, but I'm always eager to hear what other people think.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mec-typophile005_4360.png]"
