    \xA9 Flag\t\r\n\r\nContemporary graphic design is relaxed about its use of a boundless
    repertoire of design devices and printing techniques. \u201Chandmade\u201D presents
    posters whose makers have used their own hands for a whole variety of reasons\u2014autonomy,
    spontaneity, independence or delight in experiment. This can manifest itself in
    analogue processing of a digital aesthetic, more radically still in the inclusion
    of solids and material in the making of the poster or in duplicating one by hand.
    Here handmade is never seen as doing without something, but as a creative necessity.
    These works are a long way away from retro-romanticism, representing a productive
    relationship between the designers and their activity. The exhibition brings together
    Swiss and international works ranging from the vital charm of the imperfect to
    the most precise and careful work by the artist's own hands.</cite>\r\n\r\nand

    to be accurate. It looks like a celebration of [[lettering]], not [[typography]].

  body: "I concur with Stephen. These areas happen to be closely related, but they
    are quite different things. \r\n\r\nLettering is a robust and interesting field
    of its own, without mixing it with typography. It's certainly a wonderful topic
    for your flickr gallery. \r\n\r\nThere is a major definitive difference between
    Lettering, which is necessarily handmade, individual or one-off, Typography, which
    is the general use and setting of typefaces (and sometimes lettering) in layouts,
    and fonts or Typefaces, which are mechanical, repeatable systems, used for typography.
    Typefaces can be based on hand-lettering, but by definition, they repeat shapes
    in infinite combinations. Typefaces can come close, but they can't yet offer the
    true individual freedom and expressiveness of hand lettering. \r\n\r\nPeople with
    skills at hand-lettering will appreciate the distinction; their skills are rare
    and their work adds much expressiveness to the graphic scene, which typefaces
    cannot provide. I think this is what you celebrate in your image collection! "
