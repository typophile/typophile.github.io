  'a_m' and 'c_a' and i write the word 'came' how it does it work exactly.\r\n\r\nif
  my coding goes\r\n\r\nsub am by a_m;\r\nsub ca by c_a;\r\n\r\nthen i'm assuming
  it would use the a_m ligature.\r\n\r\nI'm creating a ligature rich font and was
  wondering if people know of any problems with having a lot ligatures."

    carefully which ligatures shall have priority.\r\nDon't forget the space between
    'a' and 'm', or 'c' and 'a' -- 'am' would be considered as one glyph named 'am'. "

  body: "One very common mistake is to mix up the priority of overlapping ligatures,
    e.g.\r\n\r\n<code>sub f f i by f_f_i;\r\nsub f f by f_f;\r\nsub f i by f_i;</code>\r\n\r\nIf
    that ffi ligature is not first, it will get preceded by the others and never appear.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    beware of the output of other alternate features (e.g. 'salt') affecting the input
    of ligatures. You might want an alternate f to be included in your ligature substitution
    -- or you might not. If you have contextual substitutions ('calt', 'clig'), then
    you'll have to worry about other alternates and ligatures affecting the context
    in those features, too."
