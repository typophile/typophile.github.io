body: "I'm writing my dissertaion on the visual identity of\r\nart galleries and the
  flexibility between gallery and\r\nexhibition identity. In my opinion some of the
  most\r\ninteresting and strong identites of the last five\r\nyears or so have been
  those for galleries: Tate,\r\nBarbican, Whitechapel and MOMA...\r\n\r\nIn my understanding
  an identity is a visual\r\nrepresentation of the content, personality and values\r\nof
  an organisation. Galleries house exhibitions with\r\nan entirely new set of contents,
  personalities and\r\nvalues. However when you look at (some) promotional\r\nmaterial
  of exhibitions, they are dominated by the\r\nidentity of the gallery. From a visitors
  perspective,\r\nthese campaigns are communicating very little about\r\nthe nature
  of the exhibition, only reinforcing the\r\ngalleries branding.\r\n\r\nMy questions
  are:\r\n\r\n1) How are these issues normally addressed?\r\n\r\n2) Does the emphasis
  of gallery to exhibition identity\r\nshift as time passes, when the brand is established?\r\n\r\n3)
  Does anyone have any opinions on any other gallery\r\nidentities? \r\n\r\nIf there
  is any other relevant information I should\r\nknow that would be great. If there
  are any relevant\r\nbooks on the subject I should be reading could anyone\r\npossibly
  let me know? \r\n\r\nThanks"

    a gallery.\r\nIn general, galleries don't go in for strong identities of their
    own, what you cite are exceptions, the usual approach is helvetica meets law firm,
    very understated."

    body: 'Why is there a current trend, especially in the UK for Art galleries to
      create bold typographic identities ie Whitechappel and Barbican? Its almost
      as if they are fighting for attention. Which is the opposite of the usual approach:
      helvetica meets law firm.'

  body: Marc, interesting topic. When i walk through art galleries I often think about
    your subject. Tate and Moma are fine examples. Tate's identity was firmly integrated
    with both the pamphlets that were passed out and the typography within. Another
    identities that I would throw in are those for the Guggenheim museums and also
    take a look at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York.

  body: "Marc, I'm an in-house designer at an art gallery in Melbourne, and we are
    considering a re-vamp, or at least an evaluation, of our identity system, especially
    as it relates to the promotion of exhibitions.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear some more
    about the results of your research, which I gather is long since completed. Please
    email me if this thread is not too dead.\r\n"

      your thesis Marc as you have highlighted many of the concerns of gallery directors.
      \ Hope it all went well for you.\r\n\r\nwww.originalprint.ie\r\naffordable,
