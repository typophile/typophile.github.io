body: "Greetings all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a web site design for which I would like
  to use Corbel as the suggested font of first choice for text. This is a redesign
  of a site that now uses Verdana for text and Trebuchet Bold for display. Verdana
  works fine as basal text, but looks less handsome in bold, especially when set in
  all caps. Hence the current choice of Trebuchet Bold for display. The beauty of
  Corbel is that it seems to work well everywhere in the overall look and feel that
  we desire -- u/lc, a/c, bold, bold a/c, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are <em>many</em>
  places in this site where the abbreviation MM2 appears. Since Corbel's default usage
  for numerals is old style figs, this makes for an awkward combination of characters.
  (If Typophile is displaying my post on your machine the way it does on mine, you'll
  see this right here, since I am seeing an old-style 2.) \r\n\r\nNumerals appear
  rarely on this site, apart from this one constant MM2 combination, so I am hesitant
  about using Corbel, lest site readers think it is an error.\r\n\r\nThe site is being
  built in CSS, about which I know just enough to be dangerous. And what might be
  possible in CSS3 certainly ain't possible right now . . .\r\n\r\nIf I understand
  this properly, I could ask that this be hard-coded to call for the particular desired
  glyph -- a \"2\" in <em>modern figs</em> -- so that this MM2 combination appears
  consistently throughout the site <em>if the browser's system has Corbel.</em> But
  any browser that does <em>not</em> have Corbel is going to display something unintended,
  and other than a modern-fig \"2.\" Is this correct?\r\n\r\nThe client may be fine
  seeing the MM2 combo with the very short old-style fig 2, or it may be that they'll
  reject the idea out of hand. I'm just trying to understand what are the possibilities
  before I pitch the idea of Corbel.\r\n\r\nThanks for any input.\r\n\r\nBruce"

    let the web wonks give you more expert opinions and possible solutions. All I
    can say is that I suspect you'll be setting yourself up for a world of headache
    and frustration on your current course. Myself, I would surrender the Corbel and
    look elsewhere.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "Hi Bruce!\r\n\r\nWhat Thomas said.\r\n\r\nA bit more detailed here:\r\n<cite>The
    css3 fonts module is still a working draft [\u2026] so there remains the possibility
    to address the omission of figure case selection.  [\u2026] the numerals cannot
    be \u2018transformed\u2019 to upper- or lower-case, in the style of text-transform.
    This implies that a \u2018variant\u2019 property should be used, much like font-variant
    is used to specify small caps. As such, it is proposed that a numeral-variant
    property be added to the css3 fonts module.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://webtypography.net/Harmony_and_Counterpoint/Numerals__Capitals_and_Small_Caps/3.2.1/\">webtypography.net</a>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    you can use a workaround similar to the one described here: <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/using-the-best-ampersand-available/\">Using
    The Best Ampersand Available</a>.\r\n\r\nJust tag all instances of \u2018MM2\u2019
    in your HTML with something like <code>&lt;span class=\"lf\"&gt;MM2&lt;/span&gt;</code>
    (lf for lining figures here, you can pick any name). Then, in the CSS, specify
    a sequence of sans fonts that are similar to Corbel \u2013 but have lining figures,
    as default:\r\n<code>.lf {font-family: \"Myriad Pro\", \"Myriad\", Calibri, sans-serif;}</code>\r\n\r\nThere
    certainly are more (possibly better) options. Still, Myriad is quite widespread,
    and users that have Corbel will most likely also have Calibri. Both do a great
    job.\r\nFor some other faces, you\u2019d have to adjust the size (see Lucida Sans),
    otherwise they\u2019d stand out. Unfortunately, and afaik, you can\u2019t do that
    dependent on the font, yet.\r\n\r\nThis example is rendered by Safari on Mac OSX;
    font-size: 18px. I assume your text will actually be even smaller, so the differences
    would really be insignificant.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corbel_4776.png]\r\n\r\nF"

    I correct in thinking that since Acrobat Reader uses Myriad as its default sans
    font, then almost every computer is going to have it installed?\r\n\r\nBruce "

  body: "I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not as easy as that. Fonts that come with Acrobat
    \u2013 and reside somewhere on the computer \u2013 still might be unavailable
    to the browser. If one can believe this study, Myriad is actually very rare: <a
    href=\"http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-CombinedResultsFull.shtml\">The
    most common fonts, codestyle.org</a>\r\nMaybe Joe Clark can elaborate on this
    topic? I reckon he knows quite a lot about the spread of fonts.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
    go with Calibri and rely on the fact that those come bundled, if any.\r\nKeep
    in mind most users won\u2019t see neither Corbel nor Calibri.\r\nIn any case,
    make sure to add Corbel to the end of your font stack, as a fallback, so that
    your users don\u2019t end up with some random default sans like Arial. That might
    look worse than having the old-style figures in the first place."

  body: "Well, this is exactly what is so disheartening for me when I approach web
    issues. I am a book designer, so I want to control <em>everything,</em> and of
    course I can't! \r\n\r\nMy hope was that Corbel could pop up first, on the newer
    Windows machines that happened to have it, but would rely on Verdana and Trebuchet
    as next choices for everyone else, and certainly ahead of Helvetica and Arial.
    Yet I see now that not everyone has even these fonts.\r\n\r\nThank you for the
    link to the codestyle study. Useful and  interesting. When I went to their site,
    I noted that Gill is not displayed correctly (in Gill) in the list of font names,
    and when I asked for samples of Calibri and Corbel they both displayed in Times.
    Oh well, I'm sure the hard data in percentages is correct.\r\n\r\nI look with
    envy at Sumner's site (http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/) and how gorgeously he
    sets up everything, <em>controls</em> everything! Every line break! Every subtlety
    of linespacing! Every alignment with illustrations! And of course he's doing that
    through PDFs, over which he <em>does</em> have complete control. But my collaborator
    and friend, who'll be writing code for this new site, keeps telling me to have
    as few \"pictures of words\" as possible, since it runs directly counter to the
    idea of searches, appearances in rankings, and so forth. \r\n\r\nWhat a strange
    tug of war this is, between the modern practices of searchability and any-browser-displayable
    type on the one hand, and my hot-metal, lock-it-all-up-in-the-chase and control
    every hairspace desires on the other . . . Am I a curmudgeon who can't change?
    Or am I a person who justifiably wishes to see information displayed in a particular
    and refined way, on every computer? \r\n\r\nI'm sure many of you have these conversations
    with yourselves on a regular basis. And in the end, I guess I should put up, shut
    up, and just keep on using Verdana. "
