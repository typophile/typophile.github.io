  body: "Surprisingly there actually seems to be some design to that lettering, as
    it looks like a slight flare has been added to the strokes, but otherwise it is
    a typical techno style, very popular in the freefont world. [[http://www.dafont.com/space-marine.font?nb_ppp=50&text=POLARA|Space
    Marine]] only needs some slanting to look very similar to your logo, if you don't
    mind the lack of stroke flare.\r\n\r\nI don't think this logo was done with a
    font. I think it's custom work, but the flare is almost the only thing that sets
    it apart from a quite common style.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\np.s.  Please use
    a more descriptive title in the future."
