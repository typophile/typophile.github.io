body: I&#39;ve got a logo that was developed using a Windows international font called
  PMingLiU. I&#39;d like to find a comparable commercial font that matches exactly,
  but includes different weights and additional characters. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?

    target="_blank">Lido</a> could work there.

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s either of those. I&#39;ve already tried the Garamond
    path, but the serifs on the T don&#39;t match. Good ideas though. <BR> <BR>Any
    others?

  body: Oh sorry, I didn&#39;t notice that you were looking for exact matches. <BR>Could
    you post a larger image? That would help.

  body: This looks like a variant of Times. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-eighteen/"
    target="_blank">Linotype&#39;s Times Eighteen</a> is very close, so is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/dutch-801/"
    target="_blank">Bitstream&#39;s Dutch 801</a>. <BR> <BR>Can I ask why &#39;exact&#39;
    is needed? Except side-by-side, it would take an expert to notice the minor variations
    in the different Times versions, in my opinion.

  body: Yes, it&#39;s a Chinese font. <BR> <BR>I was hoping to find a match that &#42;wasn&#39;t&#42;
    Times, but still retained the look. An exact match isn&#39;t necessary, except
    for my own satisfaction. I wanted to find a commercian font match that included
    different weights. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll look into the Times family a little deeper.
    Thanks guys!

    <BR>Close! It&#39;s a little too thick, and doesn&#39;t include the variations
    in weight that I&#39;d expect. <BR> <BR>I may just have to settle for this though.
    It&#39;s a good font to use as default for Word, Publisher, etc. And you&#39;re
    right, the FREE price tag is a great sell point! <BR> <BR>S.
