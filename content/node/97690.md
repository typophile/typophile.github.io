body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI feel like this must have popped up on this forum somewhere but
  can't seem to find anything. I'm interested in statistics on font use on the internet/computer.
  Things like how many fonts the average user has on their machine, how many different
  ones are used on websites (now that this is possible) and so on. Can anyone point
  me to reasonably reputable source/article? (I'm actually trying to create my own
  font - www.doppel-n.com - but I'm also interested in the broader issue of typography
  on the web.)\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\nHP"

  body: Probably most computers have only bundled operative system and MS Office fonts
    installed. If you are interested in statistics regarding designers it would be
    more interesting to know the average font ownership (which I'm sure has been increasing
    every year since the late 90's) rather than the number of installed fonts because
    most designers use font management sofware to activate only the fonts in use by
    their current projects.

  body: "Thanks for the comments. It's true, every computer comes with a variety of
    fonts, but how many is the question. Also, some (designers/enthusiasts) have more
    than others, so what is the average. And how might this have changed over the
    past 10+ years? I'm interested in creating an infographic on font use in the digital
    world for a class I'm taking. I'm more focused on the general public, not just
    designers. I'm looking for pointers towards actual studies/articles on this topic
    so I don't think I would be citing from a forum post.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\nHP

  body: "@Karl: Thanks for the information. A bit of advice; to make things easier
    for other members, instead of writing with ambiguous hyperlinks such as [[http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html|this]]
    and [[http://opentype.info/blog/2012/01/23/outline-font-format-development/|here]]
    try to use more descriptive language so the reader knows where the link is going
    to take them <em>before</em> they click on it. Using ambiguous words such as \u201Chere\u201D
    require the reader to read before and after the hyperlinked word in order to know
    where they are going.\r\n\r\nInstead try writing with links like this:\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    resource detailing <a href=\"http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html\">fonts
    common to both Windows and Macintosh</a> would be a good place to start.\u201D\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\u201CRalf
    Hermann produced <a href=\"http://opentype.info/blog/2012/01/23/outline-font-format-development/\">a
    fantastic infographic on outline font formats</a>.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlso notice, I
    did not hyperlink the punctuation on the second example. Another good practice
    as it contains no information relevant to the hyperlink.\r\n\r\nThe Mac and Window\u2019s
    hyperlinks are also quite misleading, which is a shame as they are very useful.
    I would have written:\r\n\r\nSee also: \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_fonts\">Wikipedia\u2019s
    list of Microsoft Windows fonts</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_fonts\">Wikipedia\u2019s
    list of typefaces included with Mac OS X</a>.\r\n\r\nNotice I matched the wording
    of the the hyperlink with the title of the Wikipedia page reinforcing in the readers
    mind that they have landed in the correct place.\r\n\r\nTakes a bit more work,
    but I like to think that comments with as much useful content such as yours are
    certainly worth the extra attention<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period\">.</a>"

    reacted so strongly to your post because you seem to cite this as some kind of
    user violation code and in a manner and tone (granted, it is difficult to judge
    from text alone) that seemed condescending, which I do not respond well to from
    people I do not know. I think you would be better placed (just my opinion) posting
    these things in the general forum guidelines and referring to them rather than
    correcting users who are being helpful without further contributing to the thread.
    I am also curious as to why you deleted your initial response and then posted
    a new one rather than editing it?\r\n\r\nI would like to think that in general
    my posts are clear, concise and quite mindful of these guidelines but I have my
    own distinct style of writing and find getting my point across comes second to
    best web etiquette, though I would like to think, never at the expense of other
    users or in a manner that would be considered \"trollish\" or rude. I will try
    and be more mindful in future."
