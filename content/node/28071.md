  I have found a lot of great font inspiration here. Now here is a type id request.
  It's the \"aNYthing\" logo (New York City based clothing company). A font close
  to this would also be great, the only one that I have that comes close is Aachen
  Bold, but it's not really the same.\r\n\r\nAlso, the same font is used for the \"ny\"
  logo of the New York Giants Football Club.\r\n\r\nSo if you could help me, I'd be
  happy. Image attached!"

    part of this logo. Device's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/quagmire/\">Quagmire</a>
    is not a slab serif, but it has a similar feel, and the right 'ny'.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "It's not an exact match, but it's close enough that if I were trying to re-create
    this look I would start here -- have a look at Storm's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/juvenis/\">'Juvenis'</a>
    Medium or Text Bold. You make the 'y' from the 'u' and you make the 'g' from the
    'q'(this is the hardest).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nyou're right...Juvenis is pretty close. Thanks.\r\n\r\nBtw,
    what would you guys call these typefaces ...I have a hard time describing them
    as English is not my native language. Just calling them bold retro doesn't really
    do them justice?"
