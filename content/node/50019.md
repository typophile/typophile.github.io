body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me to identify the fonts that are closest to the
  ones used at the two agencies I've posted? I've called them to find out which fonts
  they use for their company names but it seems to be very confidential information
  that they aren't allowed to disclose to me. Instead, I will accept the font that
  resembles these fonts the closest so that I can explain this trough a paper I have
  to write for a class I'm taking.\r\n\r\nAny help is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    think I was right on that. You've given me a bit more to go with. Thanks again.\r\n\r\nN"
