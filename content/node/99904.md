    daft? There's this <strong>TYPE ID BOARD</strong> on this website:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/typeid\r\n\r\nAnd
    the most ridiculous thing is to post a Sans serif font request in a Serif board."

  body: Maybe "Type ID Board" could be misunderstood that it's about something else
    than Type identification. Maybe it should be renamed to <strong>Help me identify
    this font/Which font is this/</strong>something.
