body: "Hi everyone, this is my first post here, I'm not a professional graphic designer,
  but I made this logo for myself.  I read a couple of other posts and I really liked
  how you guys critique and make suggestions so I wanted to know how bad my logo is,
  or who knows maybe it's not that bad.  I have already made business cards with this
  logo, however it's on a black background.  I wish I had known about this forum before
  I committed to this logo, but who knows, if you guys help me make it a real logo,
  I'll make a new batch of business cards.  Thanks you for taking the time to view
  my post.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avila_business_card_updated

  body: "Hello,\r\nThere is two stokes of colour just above and below the text Avila,
    if you remove them it will complete the A you are looking to create.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the position of the text needs to be corrected a little, possibly move it upwards
    a few pixels.\r\n\r\nPhil."

  body: "I'd align the title so the x-height is central to the bar rather than the
    cap height, because the descenders scraping the bottom of the bar makes it look
    unset.\r\n\r\nBasically i kinda like it!\r\n\r\nOh and I'd maybe try shifting
    the title left a tiny bit so the \"A\" of Avila doesn't have a failed relationship
    with the curve of the graphic \"A\" (the top being on the curve line, but the
    angle of the A goes off by the bottom of the A), possibly an OCDesque non-problem
    that though. \r\n\r\nI'm new here, so maybe listen to others more than me, my
    terminology could be way off as well, but i felt like taking the plunge."

  body: "The A and V shapes are quite nice, but the text knocked out of the extended
    crossbar is problematic. It looks like an afterthought. The font does not, in
    any way, compliment the logo, and it's not kerned properly or placed thoughtfully.
    The thin outlines and colors don't really add anything aesthetically, so I'd just
    stick to black and white without any outlines. \r\n\r\nI suggest you take the
    text out of the black bar, and put the word Avila above the line, and \"Video
    and Editing\" below. Also, please, don't use a plus sign, use an ampersand or
    write out the word. I'd start by looking at fonts like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/panorama-sg/light/\">Panorama</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/book/\">Avant
    Garde Gothic</a> or even something Bauhaus-y and fun like <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/44\">Reflex.</a>"

  body: Hello, thanks for the comments and tips.  Phil and Troop, I agree with the
    text having to be centered, and I did understand the "A" having a failed relationship
    with the other A.  However I did consider what Eileen said about the text on the
    crossbar being problematic, especially after I removed it.  Then I went even further
    as to remove the crossbar completely, and this is what I came up with.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_6108.jpg]

  body: "You still have a major scale problem, IMO. Is there some reason you feel
    like the logo must tower over the logotype? Your logo looks like a big bully next
    to the little type.  Spend some time looking around at the size relationship between
    logo and logotype. Barnes and Noble has some great logo books.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing
    you're actually designing a business card here, not a company identity, but this
    scale can't work for every application like an identity really needs to."

  body: "I like 1,2, & 5 quite a bit - I don't agree with Eileen completely about
    the scale, however I do think for legibility you'll want to bump up the logotype
    a bit.\r\n\r\nIs the \"+ Editing\" really necessary as part of your name?  Seems
    like \"Avila Videography\" or even \"Avila Video\" would be a much stronger name.
    \ \r\n\r\nAnyhoo, good luck!  You're on the right track.  :)\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "The latter solution is best. Simple and versatile. You want to separate your
    AV 'mark' and your actual company name given that you're going to have scaling
    issues if you keep them as is.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of another logo using similar
    forms flipped to create different letters. ;o)\r\n\r\n<---\r\n"

    to use a stronger pink on the white background.\r\n\r\nWatch your kerning: \"Av\"
    in \"Avila\" is loose. I agree about dropping the \"& Editing\" part. You might
    want to come up with an alternate version where the text is bigger to use at small
    sizes.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions once again.  I am trying to
    create an identity, not just business cards, but it probably looks like that because
    of the size of the last update.  I didn't have much trouble deciding whether to
    take out the "Editing" or not, but it looked weird having the two words in separate
    rows.  I just think it looked like a list, so I put both words in one single row.  I
    put a stronger orange on "Videography" and fixed the kerning.  The white background
    version is for paperwork i.e. letterheads, contracts.  The black background version
    is for business cards, promotional items, and website.  I'm very happy with this
    last update, it looks much cleaner and solid than the first.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/for
