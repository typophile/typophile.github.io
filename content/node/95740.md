  curious if anyone could tell me if this is a typeface for sale or if there is anything
  close to it? Pretty sure it is a custom deal, but was curious if anyone could point
  me to something similar. More interested in the shapes/structure I guess than the
  transparency/overlaps. Any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SVA-MPS_branding_6485.png]"
