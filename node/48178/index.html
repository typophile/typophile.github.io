  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I work for a small human factors consulting firm and we&rsquo;re currently working with a client on a new labeling system for their products. Legibility is critical for this client&rsquo;s domain, and their current designs use different color combinations in certain places to differentiate product variants.</p>
<p>Some of the color combinations they chose worried us, and so we set out to find an objective measure for legibility on which we could then base our recommendations. The best we have found thus far have been the [[http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html|color difference and contrast ratio measures]] put forth by the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixA.html#luminosity-contrastdef|W3C]] and [[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/accessibility/webaccessibility/color_tool.html|Hewlett-Packard]]. However, it worries us that these measures were created to evaluate colors on screen, not on print. After a bunch of snooping around online and looking through some of the usability books we have around the office, we&rsquo;ve been unable to find any equivalent rules for printed text.</p>
<p>If anyone knows any rules or resources that would help us with this problem, please chime in. Thanks so much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We did perform user tests, but they were small formative tests and weren&rsquo;t strenuous enough to allay our concerns. We based our recommendations for small color changes on the W3C and HP formulas I referenced above, but for some reason the client is being very hesitant to follow our advice, which is foolish. It makes much more sense for them to make these extremely minor changes now than to wait for us to potentially uncover an issue when we run our larger summative tests. By that time, making alteration could be much more time consuming and expensive.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the links. I&rsquo;m familiar with the Nilsson papers and the Peachpit article. None of them really provide the objective measure we&rsquo;re looking for. The Tinker summary is interesting. I&rsquo;m familiar with some of his studies on type legibility, but wasn&rsquo;t aware that he had published a book. That might be cool to track down at some point.</p>
<p>If I find anything interesting, I&rsquo;ll be sure to update you guys.</p>

<p>There is no such thing.
In print, graphic designers and typographers often work with Pantone colour samples.
I sometimes use the Pantone Color &amp; Black Selector, which shows what type looks like printed in a selection of colors on white, or knocked out.
But of course a sample book which showed every possible colour combination on different stocks would have millions of pages.
So the best strategy is to rely on a graphic artist with aptitude and plenty of experience in working with colors in print.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, from a design standpoint I agree with you. But from a human factors standpoint, I&rsquo;m saying there are ways to quantitatively measure the difference between a foreground and background color, and what I&rsquo;m looking for is a set of rules or guidelines that establish a threshold for legibility. Basically something like the rules in the WCAG but for print.</div>

At the general level, any guidelines are platitudes no better than common sense.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that it is possible to measure and predict performance within narrow ranges of variables, but this is really &ldquo;product development&rdquo;, and can&rsquo;t be extrapolated into valid general principles.</p>
<p>There is always one active thread or another at Typophile going on about &ldquo;readability&rdquo; tests, and I have read most of these. So far, I have not come across any reference to experiments with colour and legibility. I get the impression that most test situations are typographically naive to the point of banality (e.g. <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/46304">http://www.typophile.com/node/46304</a> ), so of little practical use.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tinker &amp; Patterson conducted a reading speed study on print that looked at a variety of ink and paper colors. Black text on white paper performed the fastest and all other combinations are reported as percent slower than black on white:</p>
<p>Black text on white paper 0
Green on white -3.0
Blue on white -3.4
Black on yellow -3.8
Red on yellow -4.8
Red on white -8.9
Green on red -10.6
Orange on black -13.5
Orange on white -20.9
Red on green -39.5
Black on purple -51.5</p>
<p>(data from Tinker’s 1962 Legibility of print book)</p>
<p>But I don’t think contrast ratio actually has anything to do with hue color, but with lightness. It’s possible to make legible text with very dark blue letters on a very light blue background. Contrast differences should be measured differences between foreground and background luminance. This Legge paper plots reading rate by contrast differences as measured in luminance differences.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think this is your important variable: Contrast. It&rsquo;s sort of basic, but any color combo you list by name (as above) could be rendered with lots of contrast or with none. I can use a light green, dark purple, deep red or light blue, so color names may not tell you very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical that the contrast analyzer algorithm takes color blindness into account. I also agree that print applications are probably different enough from the onscreen targets that you&rsquo;ll need more data. Is there some material about which colors are more distinct to more people, accounting for the ambiguity of color blindness? I know someone with color blindness, and there are certain colors that are more obvious and safe, and some that simply never resolve as true, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with saturation, lightness or what they&rsquo;re next to.</p>

<p>Why was red on green so much harder to read than green on red?
Well, the green paper was probably a light tonal value, so should have been tested against a similar tone of red, i.e. pink.</p>
<p>If black on white was best, why was red on yellow better than red on white?
That suggests it&rsquo;s not something which can be just reduced to tonal contrast.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>It would be logical for black on white to perform best, as that is what most type designs are optimized for!
However, there is another genre, news text, where typefaces are optimized for grey-on-grey.</p>

<p>Results from prose-reading tests may not transfer to labelling requirements.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually, crossgrove, the program you can download from [[http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html|this page]] can give you the contrast ratio measurements for simulated types of color blindness. It&rsquo;s very cool. We sort of used the feature informally while evaluating our client&rsquo;s color combinations, but didn&rsquo;t find any problems critical enough to warrant action.</p>
<p>Kevlar, in the case of the W3C formula we&rsquo;ve been using, the hue does play a role in the color&rsquo;s luminance, and therefore in the contrast ratio. Check out the links in my first post for more info. The equations are pretty simple and are based on RGB values. Thanks for the article though. I&rsquo;ll check it out.</p>
<p>Nick, once again I agree with you. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re not the designers. We&rsquo;re the ones trying to encourage common sense. ;-)</p>

Tinker, M.A. &amp; Patterson, D.G. (1931). Studies of Typographical Factors Influencing Speed of Reading: VII. Variations in Color of Print and Background,” Journal of Applied Psychology, 15, 471-479.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why was red on green so much harder to read than green on red?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Because the ink color and paper color are interacting when the ink is being absorbed into the paper.

This becomes obvious by noting the observed effect of color combinations in [the above data].”</p>

<p>The problem is that with legibility (like most aspects of typography) you have a huge number of variables which can interact.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say that we can&rsquo;t research the effects of various variables on legibility, and come to reasonable conclusions such as &ldquo;in general using lower contrast between text and background reduces legibility.&rdquo; But formulae, or exact numbers for the effects of a single variable, which translate to your specific situation, are impossible to get from pre-existing research.</p>
