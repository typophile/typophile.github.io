  description of the prescribed drugs.\r\n# RP. is a message from the doctor to the
  pharmacy. # is a double cross and short for \"in nomine dei\", while Rp. is short
  for \"recipe\".\r\nIn other words: In God's name take... (the prescribed drugs).\r\nNow
  I am just wondering: is this just a local Danish use of the crosshatch, or do you
  know of similiar uses elsewhere?"

  body: "Is this an old, traditional convention or still practised today? I have not
    encountered that usage of the # sign (0023) so far. \r\n\r\nApart from the typical
    meaning \u201Cnumber\u201D my records reveal few other connotations, from more
    specific contexts:\r\n\r\nmonetary: # Dukaten\r\nphonology: # word boundary\r\nmathematics:
    # equal and parallel (22D5)\r\n\r\nA similar technical sign is encoded as 2317;
    another common usage is on telephone keycaps.\r\n\r\n\u2026 and in music of course,
    though there it gets typically rendered rather vertically slanted (266F).\r\n\r\n"

    find a picture for you.

    sign is used to indicate stock weight in the paper and printing industries.\r\n\r\nE.g.

    both from Latin.\r\n"

  body: Well it's not really Rx so much as R with stroke. Rp sounds like an actual
    abbreviation instead of a symbol.

    article]] also mentions folk theories linking it to the \"Eye of Horus, or to
    the ancient symbol for Jupiter, both gods whose protection may have been sought
