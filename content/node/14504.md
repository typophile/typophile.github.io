body: "Hello, \r\nI was just wondering, how many people in the type design industry
  use to be 'strongly inspired' by previous existing font? And for 'strongly inspired'
  I mean open the font with an editing software, make major on minor changes, and
  save it as 'new'. Or grab some glyphs, make some tweaking, and include them in their
  own design. \r\nI'm telling this because I'm having a hard time in making a 's'
  without model, its sinuosities are excruciating. \r\nWhat do you think about it?\r\n\r\nthank
  you\r\nm."

    (those curves are code, mathematical data; they are copyrighted as intellectual
    property, i.e., computer programs). It is \"stealing\" someone else's work, and
    it is just plain not nice (in addition to often being illegal).\r\n\r\nLooking
    at fonts, especially in books, is great though. Many, many people are influenced
    by older types. And they are often revived. But that is something different."

  body: "Manard,\r\nThe hard work of drawing your own \"S\" will pay you dividends
    in the end.  Once you struggle through and learn from your own errors, you will
    have gained an experience far more valuable than just having a nice \"S\". Keep
    working on it, it will come to you.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    try a _fun_ s, look at a capital [[Schwabacher]] S!"

    a bit too narrow, but hey \u2014 it's a start."
