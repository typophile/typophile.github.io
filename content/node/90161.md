    for a living, and you are not only stealing his work, but also bragging about
    it in front of a forum of type designers. Do you have any idea how many hours
    is spent designing a quality typeface? "

    You can find almost anything downloadable without paying for it if you only use
    the power of GOOGLE :D <<\r\n\r\nIf Google leads you to something that isn't actually
    free, but rather the product of someone's labor which they ask payment for - and
    you take it without paying, what does that make you?\r\n\r\nIf you decide that
    taking such an item without paying is OK simply because it's \"out there\" and
    you can ... well, nothing anyone here is saying will make any difference to you."

    on MyFonts.\r\n\r\nIt has 1470 glyphs including 43 variants of the lower case
    \"h\". Without OT coding, spacing and kerning taken into consideration that's
    6.7cents per glyph.\r\n\r\nYou see? Almost free!!\r\n\r\nGo here Ashley,\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/adios-script-pro/\r\n\r\nIt's
    even quicker than stealing it."
