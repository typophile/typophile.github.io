body: "I've been working on a digitization of Michel, an old Letraset font designed
  by Michel Waxman. I am surprised this has not previously been digitized. It was
  dropped from Letraset catalogues some time in the 1980's I believe (though I don't
  have an old catalogue to confirm this against). In fact, it's only recently that
  his other font \"Optex\" has come to light (as \"Olympik\" by Jonathan Hill). I
  am wondering if there isn't some legal/licensing minefield story behind this. Biographical
  information on Michel Waxman is also scarce.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know anything of
  Mr. Waxman, and who might currently own any/all rights to his work? Does Mr. Waxman
  read this forum? I'd love for him to get in touch.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Luc Devroye
  also credits him with the design of  \"Oxford\", but that was actually the work
  of Christine Lord.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Michel_sample_6423.png]"

  body: A Google search turns up over fifty people in the US named Michel Waxman.
    Perhaps you can track him/her down that way.

  body: I think "Michel" is usually a man of French descent.  If he designed it in
    the 1970s (around 40 years ago) it's possible he's not even still living. Hopefully
    someone will know for sure.

  body: Michel and Optex are both in my 1986 Letraset catalog and in my 1976 one as
    well.
