  body: "HLPS Atlas Italic is close to your sample.  It, and a bunch of other period
    fonts can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html\r\n\r\nNote
    that these fonts have all been scanned from period advertisements, newspapers,
    documents, etc.  Their target audience is a mix of prop makers and H.P Lovecraft
    reenactors(!)  These are pretty rough, but their warts-and-all may be part of
    their attraction."
