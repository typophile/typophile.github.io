  body: "This font has the sort of exaggerated emphasis that some of Dennis Ortiz-Lopez's
    fonts have, but I looked through his site's collection of commercial and proprietary
    fonts and didn't see this. Also thought of Matthew Carter (this reminds me a slab
    version of his heavyweight Wrigley font for Sports Illustrated), or something
    Jim Parkinson might have done, but I couldn't find it in the works of either of
    them. \r\n\r\nIf I had to guess a foundry, I would have thought Font Bureau, but
    I didn't see this. Not Hoefler either.\r\n\r\nI'm curious where this will turn
    out to be from. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
