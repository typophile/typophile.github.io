body: "Does anyone know how to change the cursor setting so that when a straight line
  is drawn in Fontlab it is drawn from the top or the bottom of the line thickness
  rather than the middle.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you draw a straight line which is
  100 units thick, the cursor which draws the line is positioned in the middle of
  the line end i.e. 50.  Is it possible to change the setting so that it is positioned
  at 0 or 100.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Nope.  But if you want to position the rectangular outline resulting from
    drawing a thick line correctly, use the Editing Layers  panel to make the corner
    points' x,y coordinates visible.  Then move the shape bodily using the keyboard
    arrows until the coordinates indicate that the shape is where you want it to be.
    A better way to draw an outline, curves and all, may be to use the pen tool (Bezier
    curves) then expand the path. Good luck.
