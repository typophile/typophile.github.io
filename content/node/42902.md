body: "I have created a font in fontlab by tracing placed images, so the font is quite
  rough with lots of points. I am finishing the font and have noticed that there are
  lots of yellow nodes, which indicate where I have two points on top of each other.
  (see image)\r\n\r\nMy question is how do I get rid of these double points?\r\n\r\nIs
  there an automated way of doing it, as there are lots throughout the entire font?"
