  idea about the above typeface? At first I thought it might be something from House
  Industries, but I didn't see anything that matched in their collection. What the
  font suggests Titling Gothic FB; it's close but not quite. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    thorns - a thorn being the inverse of a trap, something intended to \"melt away\"
    to maintain a sharp corner, and not really part of the intended shape.\r\n\r\nErgo:
    you might figure out what the font is by imagining it without the flares.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much you guys. I think it definitely is Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8.
    It's an interesting thought about the flares, hrant, but I think it's most likely
    the system font. I scanned this from a book which was produced in 2005.\r\n\r\nAs
    always, much appreciated!"
