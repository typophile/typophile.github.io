  a typeface and I am pretty sure it is a custom type.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/31916775@N06/2983570281/\r\n\r\nIt
  is a Providence College hockey jersey. I want to write something in the same type
  but with different letters. I will in know way be reflecting anything poorly upon
  the school or taking money by knocking off trademarks. \r\n\r\nIf anyone can suggest
  what type it is, similar to, or a good way to replicate it I would be so thankful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChris"

    with MVB Solano Gothic Bold Cap. I think some minor crafting will bring a pretty
