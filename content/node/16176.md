  in my final year,\r\nat the academy of design and education wizo haifa,israel(its
  long)\r\nand starting working on my final project.\r\n\r\nmy project is a reserch
  on the relation between architecture and typography.\r\nthe base point of this reserch
  lay on the term \"spaces\",which as you all know \r\nspaces define form, and the
  function of spaces is the essence of the \"product\",\r\nat first i thought on working
  with constructional arch'(all forms of buildings+)\r\nto explore and find any pattern,grid,understanding,while
  searching for some material\r\nin the internet and talking to some arch'rs i found
  the term \"noli map\" and for those who\r\ndont know its a way to map a city to
  public space and living spaces,in a way that(first design by\r\nan italian arch'r,nolli,
  at the 18 century in rome).\r\nlet say black=neigborhoods white=parks,shoping areas
  and so on,as i say only in black \r\nand white,well its got me and i thought it
  will be better to relate the reserch to city space\r\nto find a way to explore relation
  between the public spaces and the living spaces,\r\nand base on the results to design
  typeface,that reflect the nature of the city in its dynamic,\r\nthats it more or
  less.\r\n\r\ni would like to hear anything that can help/inlight/cancel/++\r\nthank
  you very much\r\nguy\r\n  "

    typefaces that reflect the nature of particular cities.\r\n\r\nI'll try to search
    past posts for a link."

    John H) that draws parallels between typefaces and other cultural\r\ncontributions
    -including architecture- is \"The letter as a work of art;\r\nobservations and
    confrontations with contemporaneous expressions\r\nof art from Roman times to
    the present day\" by G Knuttel, 1951.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (commonly H. Th. Wijdeveld), a long-lived (1885-1987 -- 102 years!) Dutch architect
    who had a strong influence on Dutch design and typography in the early twentieth
    century.
