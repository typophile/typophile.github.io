  body: I tried your table (with latin letters instead of khmer letters for Cons,
    SubC1, SubC2 and Sign) and the resulting font worked as expected both on OS X
    10.5.8 and OS X 10.6.7; I could not reproduce the DzABC output string (with z
    not empty) you are describing. People experienced with Apple font development
    (and I am not one of them) don't give out much information on typophile. Good
    luck.
