  anybody can name the \"Stereo One\" underneath the first Atlantic logo in addition
  to the ATLANTIC font, that would be much appreciated as well. Thanks in advance,\r\nDanny[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Atlantic1_5675.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Atlantic2_4858.jpg]"

    on an American gothic.

  body: It's similar to fonts like Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Trade Gothic, etc.
    You can search for "gothic" to find similar, but be prepared to sort through many
    results.
