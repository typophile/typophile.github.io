body: "Hello all! \r\n\r\nI haven't been here for a while so I hope you don't think
  me rude dropping in like this. I have come to pick your brains further! \r\n\r\nAbout
  a year and half ago, I proposed my MA research plan here, which was to investigate
  what punctuation is. Naturally, I came at the project from a typographic background,
  considered it a tool of typography and a direction post through written language
  (emphasis, meaning, emotion). \r\n\r\nI've covered lots of areas such as: type,
  historical, cultural, social, performance, ethnographic and empirical research and
  now I feel I've arrived at all this information and not really sure how to work
  through it. (I'm not asking for help don't worry!)\r\n\r\nA tutor has said I've
  become an expert in the subject (though I beg to differ!) and has asked me to create
  a project that reflects unspoken signs through everyday life (like door handles,
  how do we know how to use them? A social acceptance of an unspoken rule.) This is
  supposed to help bring some of the research into a designed form such as a book
  and I think from their view, help give an insight into the research exploration.\r\n\r\nAlso
  I need to document my creative process/research process. The thing is, I follow
  my intuition and have never questioned my creative view point as I've just let it
  take its course. Which I guess you can't really put down on a PhD application! \r\n\r\nSo
  have any of you ever questioned your creative process or tried to document how you
  work through thought processes? I know I sound a bit 'willy nilly' and I really
  love researching, I just for the life of me, go blank when I start thinking about
  how I make decisions relating to design! \r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nP.S. I also have
  my research diagram if anyone is interested in taking a look. I haven't got all
  of my sources on it as it wouldn't fit! :)"
