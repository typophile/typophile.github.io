  body: Francisco, I wouldnt go for anything under 75-100 a page. If you do go lower,
    put a clause in the contract that they only get x number of revisions, and after
    that you charge a higher hourly rate &#40;about 2 or 3 revisions is good on average&#41;.
    Otherwise, you will be swamped with long and drawn out revisions over trite things.  <BR>
    <BR>You also need to factor in materials &#40;mailing final files, prints for
    your own in-house review and for the printer&#41;. Thats kind of how I came up
    at about 75-100 a page, anything less and you might only end up making 20 an hr
    when its all said and done.

    to be included.

  body: 'If you&#39;re taking over the production of an existing format, then a per-page
    fee may be appropriate.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re creating the magazine from scratch,
    you should charge a one-time fee for designing the logo, developing the architecture/grid/color
    palette, creating style sheets, etc.  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t overlook the costs associated
    with licensing fonts, archiving/storing each issue, and handling ads. Ads in particular
    can eat up a lot of time, since advertisers may submit their materials in a format
    that requires work on your part. <BR> <BR>Two books with useful information on
