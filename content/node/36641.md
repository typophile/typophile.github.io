body: "Hi\r\nI'm looking for a display serif, it needs to be strong, sharp and modern
  (something like Mercury from HFJ). It would be used for headlines in a newspaper.
  Farnham is also pretty close, but these feel a bit overused around here. I have
  always liked the fonts of Gerard Unger, but clients don't seem to understand him
  around here. \r\nIt would need at least Regular and Bold, but a Light would be great. "

    is flash which has no direct links).

  body: "Well, to be more specific, Farnham is overused in the sense that one of the
    biggest tabloids in Finland uses it (and in this case one of the \"bad\" tabloids).
    In Sweden it has also been used for several highly ranked tabloids. In Scandinavia
    everyone looks at everyone, and it's always nice to find new type. Mercury is
    more used in Finland in magazines, in Sweden both newspapers and magazines use
    it a lot. \r\nFreight Display was on the top of my list. Now I have to check all
    these options. Greta does look good. \r\nSo does Newzald Kris, but for this project
    it might not cut the deadline. \r\nI'll go through this as soon as possible. Thanks
    a lot!\r\n\r\nPS. Has anyone used/seen Union from Alias as for headlines/display?"

  body: "I'm not sure if you necessarily require the Dutch oldstyle qualities of Farnham
    and Mercury. If not, and you're open to other contemporary serif styles, then
    you might consider the Whitman Display family for newspaper headlines. Font Bureau
    should be announcing the retail release any day now.\r\n\r\nWhitman Display is
    currently used in the <a href=\"http://www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002364.php\"
    target=new>Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=WA_NT&ref_pge=lst\"

    target=new>Idaho Statesman</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002617.php\"
    target=new>New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal</a>.\r\n\r\nThere are some publications
    in Sweden and Norway that have picked up a few styles of the Display also, but
    I haven't seen them in use yet -- Ulricehamns Tidning in Sweden, and Firda in
    Norway. \r\n\r\nBTW, Whitman is used for serif text in Finland's Trendi magazine.
    This would give you some idea how the typeface works in the Finnish language.
    But they aren't using any Display.\r\n\r\nI posted some pre-release review samples
    of the expanded family in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33419\" target=new>this
    thread</a> a while back.\r\n\r\nWe should have <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman\"
    target=new>FB's website</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.kentlew.com/Type.html\"
    target=new>my own</a>, updated by next week with PDF samples and everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--
