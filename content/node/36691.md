    values will change as well.

  body: I find justified text looks worst in narrow columns, because those are the
    ones most likely to generate rivers. My rule of thumb is to not justify any column
    less than 44 characters wide.

  body: "On a narrow column a ragged right edge always looks better than justified
    text full of big gaps, rivers, and too many hyphens. James' rule of thumb for
    the cut-off point is good.\r\n\r\nMy standard settings (in InDesign) for word
    spacing in justified text are 85/100/130, but I will set the minimum to 80 in
    narrower settings if necessary. Some typesetters will go to a minimum of 75: to
    some extent that depends on the tightness a particular typeface will tolerate.
    Hyphenation settings can also vary depending on the width: on narrow columns,
    I may set it to 3 in a row from my normal 2 allowed. I usually check the \"hyphenate
    capitalized words\" option, but this is a necessity on narrow columns.\r\n\r\nA
    slightly condensed typeface of course will help on a narrow setting if you have
    to justify. But don't artificially squish a regular face."

  body: "I also try to keep narrow columns right ragged, as it keeps the number of
    hypens down a bit, and personally prefer right ragged anytime (did a whole magazine
    all left justified:). \r\nMy standard settings in InDesign is about 67-75/90-100/100-120,
    depending on type and language (Finnish is a horrible language with all tooooo
    long words). This also depends how much the style is kerned from the beginning
    as well. "

  body: "Much depends on your situation. As a *commercial* typesetter -- always books
    -- the comps in our company usually have no say over whether or not the type is
    to be set justified or ragged. The design is supplied along with the copy.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you have more of a free hand -- you are the designer -- I would pay attention
    to who the intended audience is. Frequently, typophiles have different preferences
    than the reading public. For example, in a slightly less than normal text measure,
    a typophile may suggest setting ragged, because they just cannot stand the variance
    in word spacing that will likely result. But the reading public tends to be more
    comfortable with justified copy (in a book & usually a magazine), for the simple
    reason that a justified setting is what is most common. When you vary from what
    is common, you call attention to what you have done, for good or ill. Newspapers
    and brochures often have a ragged setting, so if your printed piece is one of
    these, you can rely on different audience expectations.\r\n\r\nAs to generalities:
    you will just have to accept more variance in word space with a narrower column
    (measure). \r\n\r\nHow to find the values:\r\n\r\nSet at least a page ragged right,
    with the min-ideal-max spaceband values all set the same. You might as well start
    with 100% -- the type designer's thinking. But if this is too loose or tight for
    your eye, change the values up or down until the spacing is what you want. With
    some fonts, I've gone as low as 90% & it wouldn't surprise me to come across some
    where I'd go lower.\r\n\r\nBTW ALWAYS PRINT OUT THE PAGE. The screen display will
    fool you.\r\n\r\nNow go for the minimum value. Change the setting to justified,
    use your newly determined \"ideal\" value where 100% is now, and set the minimum,
    to, say, 75%. Set (& print out) a couple of pages -- that would be around 80 lines
    & at least six paragraphs in my type of work. See if the tightest line is going
    too tight. If so, change the 75% to a higher value. If not, keep dropping it down.\r\n\r\nI
    don't see the upper value changing much in the final setting. Unlike some layout
    programs (e.g., TeX) InDesign (& PageMaker & Quark) will violate (exceed) the
    \"maximum\" value. What will change is the number & severity of the *violations*
    if you toggle that display on. But I've set my two pages as above with a 133%
    and then changed it to 500% maximum & not one line break changed. I suppose under
    some situations, it might.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit or work -- 15 to 20 minutes --
    to go through with a typeface, & should be good for a reasonable range of sizes
    and measures -- say 22 to 27 pica measure, 9-10-11 point type. If you change the
    size or measure too much, you need to go through the test again to confirm things.\r\n\r\nI
    also allow plus & minus  0.1% variation in letterspacing and scaling. It isn't
    much, but it can help, and with values that small, no, you cannot see it. But
    I've watched a hyphen block go away when using that small amount of letterspacing/scaling.\r\n\r\nIf
    I've given the impression that you cannot just use someone else's typeface preference
    or values, that was on purpose. Using type well depends on a certain familiarity
    & understanding of it's behavior. You cannot borrow either familiarity or understanding.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Charles -- Good advice. I have used similar methods in evaluating typefaces
    and H&J settings/parameters.\r\n\r\nOne thing I might add. In addition to the
    evaluation to determine the optimum spaceband (which, as Charles points out is
    not always 100%, depending upon the font/designer/foundry), I do a similar, unjustified
    pass to identify what percentage minimum I deem to be an acceptable lower end.
    \r\n\r\nIn the second step that Charles describes, with a justified setting, you
    can't be certain that the tightest line you are evaluating is equivalent to your
    min setting, nor that the full effect of your min setting has been applied anywhere.
    So, I introduce this intermediate evaluation. \r\n\r\nThat is to say, I keep the
    setting as fl/rr and adjust the optimum (or ideal) downward. (In fl/rr setting,
    this middle setting is the only value that has any effect.) This way I can see
    the direct result of the spacing value. Once I determine an acceptable minimum,
    then I apply it to the Min value in the manner Charles suggests (reverting the
    Optimum to my ideal and setting justified) and see how it plays out in text.\r\n\r\n--
    K."

  body: "Yes, Kent's method gives a certain kind of information. I have tired it,
    and it doesn't work as well for me, because at several levels, \"too tight\" is
    a relative notion. There is absolutely \"too tight,\" and also \"too tight in
    this context,\" where \"this context\" is the other spacing values at play.\r\n\r\nThe
    moral is there is no right or wrong way, it depends on your eye & the various
    ways you can fool yourself.\r\n\r\nAs to not needing to make the three values
    the same for ragged settings -- I'm real new to InDesign, but it seems to me that
    under some conditions, you can set ragged & have the wordspace value change. This
    is actually a plus -- With TeX, I use to allow a small variation -- say 20/1000ths
    of an em -- to help with ragged settings.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
