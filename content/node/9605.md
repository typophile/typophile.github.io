  trusty Selectric, or what? And, what face, size, settings, etc? <BR> <BR>I have
  been using Nisus Express and Lexicon2A at 13 pt, but I&#39;m not happy. <BR>John

  body: My letters are done with Indesign CS set in Le Monde Courrier. <BR>My invoices
    are done via a Filemaker database set in Le Monde Courrier. <BR>Booth use similar
    layout and Le Monde Courrier is for the content only. <BR><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrier"

    <BR> <BR>My contact info, company info, logotype are not printed via offset litho
    but printed by Filemaker or Indesign, to let change them depending what I currently
    need. My letterheads &#40;several colors variations&#41; are in fact printed in
    2 colors but without any text on it, its just sort of background who can be used
    for various uses. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>My emails are done with AppleMail,
    set in Georgia via my prefs, but always as plain text, so read as whatyouwant
    when you receive them. <BR> <BR>My chat are done with iChat, set in Costa PTF
    &#40;my side indeed&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/CostaPTF"

  body: Recently I&#39;ve been doing letters in Handsome Pro, an OpenType handwriting
    face. It&#39;s a good way to test it out. Have to use InDesign to get the contextual
    ligatures happening. <BR> <BR>I always put everything on one page, so size and
    leading etc. can vary with how much I have to say. Bit of a time-waster, but for
    a typographer, what better way to waste time?

  body: When I first started writing long text I was using Quark. Now I bounce in
    between TextEdit, Mellel and Word. At the moment I using Auto 1 from Underware
    in all of my correspondence applications &#40;including iChat&#41;.

  body: TextEdit for writing. InDesign CS for layout. The measurements &#40;even paper
    size&#41; for personal stuff I customize to accomodate the amount of copy. For
    business stuff, it&#39;s always letter sized paper with margins/leading adjusted
    for content &#40;I don&#39;t have letterhead&#41;. <BR> <BR>I use Scala and Scala
    Sans for all of my business stuff, and mostly on my personal stuff. Sometimes
    I use Whitman or some other face I just discovered/licensed.

  body: Good point Tiffany! <BR>Yes, indeed, when its matter of writing long texts,
    I use a text editor, the most basic as possible, like SubEthaEdit &#40;even with
    that one, via iChat functions, you can wrote in collaborative way, very fun!&#41;

    Well... I have Office 2004, but mostly to test fonts, I don&#39;t use such applications
    on the Mac, its better on Windows.

  body: 'Hmmm. I am curious which &#34;TextEdit&#34; program Tiffany and Chris use
    as there are many with that name. I am looking for something to replace Word.
    My current workflow: enter text into Word, do some formatting &#40;i.e. apply
    styles to inline quotes, headings, etc.&#41; and then import into Indesign CS
    with the analogous paragraph styles defined. Does anyone have a better solution?
    <BR> <BR>I realize that I am getting a little off topic. I use Myriad Pro for
    most official correspondence and a pen for personal correspondence.'
