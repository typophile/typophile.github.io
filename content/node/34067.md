  body: The album was released in 1977, so this is pre-digital. It's closer to Monotype's
    version of Benton's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/eagle_bold/&sample_text=%E2%80%9CHEROES%E2%80%9D&sample_size=72">Eagle
    Bold</a>. Font Bureau's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=eagle">Eagle</a>
    is a bit more narrow, but a better digitization with more weights and decent spacing.
