Before I even ask- I will totally pay for services. You have a paypal account? I have a paypal account! unless it's not allowed? I didn't see anything that said we couldn't offer money.
I changed the name of my salon after my business partner left. It was Nails, Etc and I changed it to Scottsdale Hair & Nails - because now we do hair and hair people don't want to be "etc".
THEN the city made me add Downtown to it. So it's downtown scottsdale Hair & Nails.
I've had three logos created. One by a paid "professional", one by me and one by a sign guy. They both were totally vanilla. Plus- I have no idea what I'm doing - clients say "do it yourself" and to them I say "get out!" (the sign guy used orange on a dark window - you can only see it if you're wearing glasses and standing right in front of it.
I spent two days trying to pick out a font and I give up. The best thing I came up with was using the ampersand from microgramma from masterfont. sad huh? See!
I'm not even looking for a logo so much as a decent font that will be visible from more than 10 feet away. Something that doesn't look generic.
Am I asking for too much? Tell me if I am. I even have photos of the salon so you can get an idea of what it's like.

(no log in necessary, just click to view)
It's modern and a little industrial- zen-ish. My biggest concern is not having a font that looks oriental because so many people associate it with discount salons.
Is anyone interested? If not, would you refer me to someone?
Thank you so much.

I'm trying to post a link from imageshack but I'm having a hard time figuring it out...
I like the look of washington square NF, however it's not ideal for window signs. I think I like the tall d's and l's. It reminds me a little of old hollywood.</div>

<div class=commentbody>one more comment from me...I just want to say that I read the post about the band logo and I was hesitant to ask. I was just frustrated with the lack of creativity from well, myself and the two other people I used.
Having been through a nightmare paying for a logo and then having my sign guy/wannabe graphic designer install yuck on my windows. I understand the value in having something that I like and that works.
The problem is- how does a person really know what they're getting? You can see portfolios online and see the sign/logos they've created but honestly - you can still be buggered!
When I found this board I looked at the critiques of logos and thought "The people here are passionate about their work - they probably see print anywhere and know the font!" I thought it would be a good place to get great ideas or at least referrals for great ideas...but never for free.
fyi- You can't believe how many times an old man has walked in to my salon with thick toenails the color of a schoolbus and said "can't you just cut my toenails?" and expected it for free.

<div class=commentbody>Hmm well I'm interested in working on this I think. Could you possibly email me at bakes2k@hotmail.com and maybe we just chat a lil bit and I can explain myself.
Just an idea, I'm cool either way :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Deanna, you should tell what kind of customers you want. If there’s already another salon, then it might be good for you to focus on a different group of customers. Or go straight ahead to compete them, if you now you can do it better.
Anyway, it is only after you tell us what kind of customers you want and what kind of image you want to give them that someone can design an identity for you.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for responding medivh and Grot Esque. Someone from here contacted me and I've forwarded my information to him. Medivh-I'll keep your contact info just in case he changes his mind.
Grot Esque- other salon? It's a sea of salons here in Scottsdale. My salon is an existing salon. I've had it since 1992. I'm just revamping, remodeling and rebranding.
"It’s modern and a little industrial- zen-ish. My biggest concern is not having a font that looks oriental because so many people associate it with discount salons."
I'm interested in conveying the same for my logo. Clean lines, relaxed atmosphere. I have a full clientelle so I never thought of what sort of clients to attract. I'm interested in attracting booth renters so my hair stations are full. Good question. I haven't been asked that before.
Probably the reason I haven't been happy with a logo.
