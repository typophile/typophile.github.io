body: I need to know what 'AlluringScriptb' is in font or typeface form. Any help
  would be appreciated! I can't get the image to load but if you google it the writing
  says "table 12" brenda bernstein. I would really appreciate this. If it is named
  alluringscriptb I need to know where to buy or download it.

    suspect that such companies would tend to use fonts that aren't publicly available,
    but I might very well be wrong."
