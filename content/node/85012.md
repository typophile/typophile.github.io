  - New WIP Newsletter\r\n\r\nSo I'm having to redesign a newsletter for a start-up
  technology company and what the previous designer left behind was a little...cute
  and whimsical, instead of clean and professional. The typefaces in my up-to-date
  version is Times new roman 10 pt for the body at 14pt leading, News Gothic headings.
  I have some questions and I'd like some critique!\r\n\r\nTypefaces - I've used Futura,
  News Gothic and Gotham for their other collateral. Which one for headings, and what
  is a good compliment for body text? I've tried all of them as body text and its
  not working out very well..I need a modern looking complimentary typeface that reads
  well in news column format.\r\n\r\nPhotos - as you can see I'm trying for a cleaner,
  modular layout with the images. Is it working or not? what can I do to improve the
  look? I want it clean, tidy and impressive looking.\r\n\r\nPhoto captions - what
  size should I use, what positioning and what typeface?\r\n\r\nOverall Layout - any
  critique or ideas are welcome! I'm eager to learn anything I can from more experienced
  designers and typographers. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
