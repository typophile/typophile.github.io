    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant

  body: "'Akhand' is a fairly loose concept. From an OpenType perspective, it simply
    refers to conjunct ligatures that are formed before other shaping occurs. The
    two that are identified in the MS Devanagari spec are conjuncts that are traditionally
    treated as separate letters in some situations, e.g. being mapped to individual
    keys on keyboards.\r\n\r\n[The word 'akhand' had an entirely different meaning
    in some earlier typesetting technologies.]"

    the Devanagari keyboard I was able to get the glyphs \u0915\u094D\u0937 and \u091E,
    as I have just done here. For the glyph \u0915\u094D\u0937, I used the key corresponding
    to the '&' on the US keyboard, and it seems to be equal to the KaSsa ligature
    mentioned above. The second one though, which I obtained by typing '}' in the
    US kb, doesn't seem to equal the JaNya ligature. Just by looking at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Devanagari_INSCRIPT_Keyboard.JPG|Devanagari
    keyboard]], I couldn't find any other candidate for the JaNya ligature glyph.
    Could you clarify ?"

    body: "I'm still striving to correctly recognize the devanagari characters. After
      a few hours of research on this issue, I think I finally found out the answer
      for the doubts, I expressed above.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, the KaSsa ligature,
      that was no problem, it was correctly recognized and reproduced in MS Word,
      by typing :\r\n\r\n          \u0915 + \u094D + \u0937 = \u0915\u094D\u0937\r\n\r\nusing
      the Devanagari keyboard.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the JaNya ligature was due
      to the fact that I didn't recognized correctly the character \u091C\u094D\u091E
      in the alluded keyboard, mistaking it with the character \u091E. Making this
      correction, I obtained in MS Word the expected result :\r\n\r\n          \u091C
      + \u094D + \u091E = \u091C\u094D\u091E\r\n\r\nAnd more, these two characters
      (or glyphs), \u0915\u094D\u0937 and \u091C\u094D\u091E, although not Unicode
      points, they are present in the Devanagari keyboard, on the keys corresponding,
      respectively, to the characters '&' and '%', in the American keyboard, as John
      mentioned above.\r\n\r\nOne other important point : when I said \"obtained in
      MS Word\", I meant that MS Word automatically replaced the typed characters
      with the glyphs at the right of the equal signs, when the ligatures were identified
      by the shaping engine, used by Word. \r\n\r\n "

    the Indic characters show above. The strangest thing is that while I previewed
    the text yesterday, everything seemed to be all right. Even after I've posted
    it, I could see the text was in perfect conditions yesterday. But no more today.
    That's weird. Maybe I've done something wrong while mixing Indic and Latin characters.
    Any suggestion to avoid or work around this ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit
    :</strong> As soon as I posted this last thread, the problems related above suddenly
    disappeared again. I have no idea what's happening here !"
