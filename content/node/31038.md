  resource intended to educate type designers on how to create properly-formed diacritical
  characters for international fonts. This project has been developed by [[Filip Blazek|Filip
  Bla\u017Eek]] and is intended to be a collaborative effort in wiki format.\r\nBla\u017Eek
  writes:\r\n<cite>The aim of this project is to build a free on-line database of
  knowledge and experience \u2014 how to design correct diacritics: what size, shape
  and position an accent should have. Text concerning the history, use, languages
  and also some technical information is related to each diacritical mark. The project
  web site is based on wiki: after a simple registration, anyone can append or correct
  any published text or upload pictures. There is no need for special knowledge of
  HTML code, the editing is also similar to Wikipedia.</cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion</strong>\r\n<a
