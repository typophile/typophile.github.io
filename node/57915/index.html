  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm working on my PhD thesis and it struck me that I have been using Times New Roman for years without ever questioning the almighty manuals that most brazilian academics follow. Most ABNT (the brazilian ISO or DIN) manuals say that fonts must be either Arial or Times New Roman, but I'm willing to break this rule.

After considering using a typewriter or a DOS font, I began more serious research on what substitutes could I use to make my text look exciting and smart.

I started to research the subject and discovered that Yale solved the problem in a very simple way: they designed their own typeface:

http://www.yale.edu/universityprinter/typeface/

I'd like to ask you all for more sugestions on what typefaces could be used for a PhD thesis, and if you know the rules used my other universities. Maybe even what faces were used in certain famous works, etc.

Thanks,

Dan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is a mistake to think there is an "academic look." Different typefaces work well with different subjects. Even in your field, (Cinema?), I would choose different fonts depending on the subject. For example, if your thesis is "Romantic Comedies starring Doris Day," it would likely get a different font than "Film Noir, 1955-60."

As to Times Roman, It too has appropriate and inappropriate uses, though today, it seems few think it has any appropriate uses.

I think it is decried for two reasons. The first is it is used a lot, and boredom sets in "The Designer's Bored and the Reader Pays" might make a good dissertation topic. The second and more important reason is the font hasn't moved gracefully from metal to photocomp and digital. Probably because everybody who's capable is bored with it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all very much for your input. I printed test pages of around 30 fonts to compare them, and will add Andron and Skolar to the tests.

But so far I'm sticking to Palatino. First of all because I prefer my text to be in serifs, both for faster reading, and also to make it look "old school". Besides, when compared with the other serif fonts I chose, it was the only one that looked slightly wider. Times New Roman printed in size 12 looks a bit thin to me: the thinner lines almost vanish.

I was amazed to see how much different the line space differed from face to face. Even among fonts of the same foundry: Adobe Jenson looked way more compact than Adobe Caslon, even tho both showed the same line width.

Anyway, thanks all again for the tips.</div>

So first find out if there is a problem with using another typeface than Times New Roman.If not and you have scope, then there are lots that will work, but if you are not a designer I would get feedback from a designer on your trial design.

		<div class="commentbody">Well readability is or course important, but for academical texts it's also necessary that the typeface has certain specific characters -- at least in my opinion -- to name one example, superscript digits from 0 to 9 (and not only 123, like lots of typefaces) for footnotes. But preferably also optical sizes, so you can use a proper optical size font for footnotes at 6 to 8 points or so. Since these kind of texts potentially contain lots of numbers, like years and dates, old style figures would also be nice. But also tabular figures for things like tables.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I imagine you'll be using Microsoft Word; perhaps more important than the font choice is the proper use of paragraph formatting, leading, etc. If you want your paper to stand out, don't use Microsoft's default settings, which are typographically atrocious. Don't double-space after punctuation (if that's how you learned to type, use find/change to change double spaces to single spaces), don't type multiple spaces for indents, etc. Learn to use the paragraph formats pane, and make adjustments as necessary.

Beyond the settings Cameron mentions above, the other one that vastly improves things (apart from "always work with invisibles showing") is that if you're doing fully-justified, to seek out and switch on the compatibility option for doing fully-justified text like WordPerfect (!). The end result still looks a bit naff on screen (appearing to squoosh the text at the right-hand end of the line) but prints out sensibly.

Er, and switch on kerning in your Normal template (and/or whatever template you're doing the thesis in) for all the styles you expect to actually use (esp. the <em>Normal</em> style* as new ones are likely to be based on it initially).

Oh, so true. Getting acceptable typography from Word requires twice the effort one needs to expend if one works in XPress or InDesign. And most Word users don’t or won’t expend the effort; instead of setting a tab in the required location, they’ll just hit <em>tab, tab, tab, tab</em>, until they arrive in the approximate neighborhood.

And people like bowerbird (e-book posts) seem to value content above all else; he seems to think typographers are an outdated bunch of navel-contemplators.

I don't know... 9 out of 10 attemps at proper typography from Word fail in my opinion. I see it as a tool to <em>write</em> text with, not to do the typography with. Not to mention if you want to work with a few images... one of the most annoying experiences with software I've ever had.

If you have to the typography of your academical texts or disserations in Word, you'll have to accept mediocre results.</div>

Also, being a recovering academic myself, I once thought Word was the tool to write text with, but actually it's not. 

If you are working on anything bigger than a business letter, you should be using a tool that helps you capture, organize, search, and compare the snippets of your own research. You shouldn't have to force your thoughts into a single bottomless page that Word offers (much like an ancient scroll).

I've started using [[http://www.devon-technologies.com/download/index.html|DevonThink]]. Download it and try it out. It saves all your writing in Rich Text Format (RTF). You can then export all your notes into whatever other software you like to typeset the whole thing properly.

But most important of all, it helps you manage your information in a way that makes sense for the 21st century. Rather than trying to explain it all myself, I would ask you to read how author Steven Johnson uses it [[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/books/review/30JOHNSON.html?_r=1&oref=login|to write his books]].

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Daniel,

ABNT really doesn't specify which fonts you should use. You should check your department rules (which might not follow ABNT). Actually, I learned that ABNT rules even accept numbered citations (which most people in Brazil don't even know). The choice you have to make is if you want to use free/opensource fonts or commercial ones, or if you will use a real typesetting software (like InDesign or Latex) or Word. I use latex with Xetex (for fonts) and the ABNT package, which does all the dirty formatting work for me (biblio, citations, quotes, front page, etc.), and so far I've been trying Arno Pro for text and Hypatia Sans Pro for titles, with good results.</div>
