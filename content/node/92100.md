  a few dingbats extra.  This font has been doing very well on the MyFonts charts
  since its debut.  I don't get it. Do you get it?\r\n\r\n"

    this http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=107 but done right."

  body: Very aggressive pricing. I'll bet many folks don't even have a specific use
    in mind; it's just an impulse buy.

  body: It seems to do what it does very well. It looks authentically 'retro' in style,
    as demonstrated in the MyFonts visuals, and the degraded effect looks natural,
    like the result of an analog process.

  body: "I can actually see this used in letterpress printing, allowing for faux under-inking
    without having to worry about actually carefully under-inking!  :-/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    it's interesting to compare Veneer to this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/anodyne/\r\nSame
    designer, about two months prior, not nearly as dirt cheap...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    their stuff by hand.

  body: "Yeah, I didn't see that price cut at first. \r\n\r\nI also think it's interesting
    that only a few of the fonts in the top 50 are not display fonts.  I guess people
    don't go out looking for book fonts all that much."
