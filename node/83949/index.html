  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello. I&rsquo;ve posted a few times here asking for advice and critiques of various fonts. Each time, I&rsquo;ve been rather impressed with the suggestions and advice. Well, I&rsquo;ve come back for another round, asking for your help in this:</p>
<p>I have found a copy of the Biblia Sacra ex Sebastiani Castellionis I would like to get republished. Other than the rare scanned reprint of the few remaining original copies, this Latin-language Bible is nearly impossible to find. It was published shortly before the old Clementine Vulgate, and was the only translation of its kind: instead of using the simpler Ecclesiastical style, Châteillon&rsquo;s edition was in the far more complex Classical style, and was censored by both the Protestants and Catholics of the time because of it. Châteillon himself was raised a Catholic and eventually joined up with Calvin. Later, he broke with Calvin over a censorship issue (Calvin was for censoring opposing viewpoints, Châteillon was against). He was widely known in his day as a skilled translator, and was fluent in French and Italian, and was known to be a master of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He was also proficient in German.</p>
<p>I am not wanting to reprint the extant copies of Châteillon&rsquo;s translation (which is non-partisan compared to most translations on the market then and now. It contains the entire Deuterocannon, unlike most translations done by Protestants and has numerous references to Roman mythology - such as, in Genesis, instead of using the more traditionally Christian &ldquo;LORD God&rdquo;, Châteillon used &ldquo;Iova Deus&rdquo; - the first part of which phonetically sounds like the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, and also happens to be one of the traditional titles of Jupiter (Jove); as well as referring to Hell as &ldquo;orcus&rdquo; rather than the more Ecclesiastical &ldquo;infernus&rdquo;.). I however, wish to reformat it - the verse numbers in the extant copies are unclear and there is neither a system of paragraphs nor the verses listed out clearly, as in a list.</p>
<p>So, here is my request:</p>
<p>I am looking for a font for the above kind of Bible. If it costs money, I will save up the sufficient funds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like a typeface that is sturdy, masculine, and handsome. Something that is readable and legible. Something that is kind to the eyes in large quantities and appropriately small size (Although I have seen an edition of the Clementine Vulgate printed in 1914 with a rather large size, what looked about the size of a 14 pt Times). I need to research paper - some suggestions for that would also be nice. I&rsquo;d like a sturdy paper that will last, but not be thick. I may try to put out this text in multiple volumes. I would like the font to look good in Italian calfskin and at the same time convey a sense of the sound of Classical Latin (I&rsquo;m a language major, so I think in sounds, I apologize). If you google search &ldquo;Classical Latin Pronunciation,&rdquo; the Wheelock&rsquo;s site and the ancienthistory.about.com have some decent recordings, as well as the Latinum podcast.</p>
<p>I apologize if this is a hefty order, but thank you all for the help.</p>

<p>I think Beorcana should work well anywhere from 9 to 12 pts for this particular project. Perchance I may be able to get it by Christmas! (I&rsquo;m a student, so I&rsquo;m rather poor).</p>
<p>I am familiar with Andron, as I pay close attention to MUFI, which promotes it. It is a nice font, as is Livory. I think, however, that Beorcana is the best I&rsquo;ve come across for this project thus far.</p>

<p>Like Mr. Freiberger I would be rather sceptic about a non-serif for such a treatise. But it may be an option.
If it comes to serif faces, Merlo seems particular interesting: it looks excellent, will be very legible and – has a Spanish background. If that does any count.
If you’ll need more than Latin the choice may get narrowed down. Is there other scripts in that book than Latin? I’d very much to see some images …</p>

<p>I typically prefer serifs.</p>
<p>The favored style for this project is, beyond what I have already stated (sturdy, masculine, handsome): typically Roman or Renaissance. I mean something that evokes the Classical world.</p>
<p>I need only Latin coverage for this Bible. I would add macrons (most fonts have them, although the most common missing macron is for the u), so to aid in the pronunciation, but it makes the text look unappealing. The macrons are not in the original edition from which I am working, but the Classical style of Latin (in which this Bible was produced) was developed to be pleasing when read. So macrons will probably be needed. If the font does not have macrons, but fits every other criterion best, I will forego macrons.</p>
<p>Also, I am partial to old style numerals, but that is not necessarily needed in this project.</p>
<p>I want the font -ideally - to be something that would work for a Bible, a Latin edition of Vergil, of Caesar, of Cicero - to evoke the kind of beauty, authority, and majesty of their language.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Latinus, thanks a lot for pointing at the print reproductions. 
I looked at them with much great interest, not only because I happen to sit in the very city the book was printed in. ;-) I am struck by viewing this print.</p>
<p>I’m no expert in the detailed type history of that time. Nor do I know if any scholar might have published about that particular typeface so far anywhere. Maybe the face is well-known, maybe there are even digitized versions around already. Does anybody know?</p>
<p>Only from what I see at a first glance, just a few random thoughts:
– overall appearance of the typeface on the printed page: perfect. matured and extremely well balanced.
– a type of the Caslon era, but obviously influenced rather by the Garalde and even (!) the Bembonian traditions, probably influences from dutch typefaces. The c looks like Rotis, incredible.
– the Italic looks like actual Garamond to me.
– the mood and several details, though hinting back onto Garamond (Le Bé?) and even Francesco Griffo, seems to anticipate some features of Fleischmann and perhaps even Walbaum – 1729 ! “Transitional” in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, a typographical reproduction of that print seems to be a most worthy case. Even more so if the edition is of some notable historical value. But then, please: I’d love to see it revived faithfully down to the very glyphs: long ſ’s, ligatures, and that remarkable quad space between sentences.</p>
<p>Just my two pence.</p>

<p>your last post certainly identifies a problem. I would love to have a reproduction of that very typeface, but, alas - cannot find one, and have as yet no skill to reproduce it (which is why I come here - to ask for those with more skill than I). I do not think FontForge, which is the only program I am able to afford right now, could do the typeface any justice. Perhaps this project will be more long-term than I thought. I may just have to either find someone who can reproduce it and come up with the money for such a reproduction or learn to reproduce it myself, although I would probably need a great deal of help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I remember reading that article when I was looking for a good Caslon remake (I still have my eyes on Williams Caslon, as I have since I discovered it, but do not think it is necessarily the best option for this Bible).</p>
<p>I do not wish to produce a facsimile edition - which is why I was looking originally for a good font to reproduce the contents rather than the appearance of the original. There is at least one facsimile print of the Bible available on the market. I think that is good for its historical merit - but I want a production that will make the contents themselves the focus - and for that, it needs to be done in such a way as to make it available to the modern reader. I want as few barriers as possible between the contents and the reader - and I want a face that aids in the tone of the work, and a binding and paper as well that adds to the work and will ensure its survival.</p>
<p>My previous post was about the typeface itself - its essential flavor I think is what I want for the edition I hope to produce, though I am uncertain as to how to achieve that typeface&rsquo;s flavor with another.</p>
<p>I apologize for conflicting posts, as I think more and reflect upon those with more experience than I, I begin to see things more clearly in regard to the direction of the project. Thank you.</p>

<p>For something “different” (and with the help of Bringhurt&rsquo;s type specimen from his “The Elements of Style”), I&rsquo;d throw in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-quadraat/|Quadraat]] (or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_quadraat_sans_ot/|Quadraat Sans]], for that matter), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/columbus-mt/|Columbus]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kinesis-mm/|Kinesis]], [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_seria_ot/|Seria]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-mendoza-roman/|Mendoza]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trajanus/|Trajanus]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/antique-ancienne/|Antique]] and [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/lapture|Lapture]], for instance.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I still think Beorcana works in text. Although it seems logical to believe that the serifs themselves are the main cause for better readability in serif faces, I believe a lot also depends on the diagonal stress, which is rarely (or to a smaller extend) found in sans serif type. Beorcana breaks that rule. It has everything a serif has, without serifs. I would even argue that the more open lettershapes of Beorcana might create even better readability than, let&rsquo;s say Adobe Garamond. This is based on loose ground, but it would be awesome to see some sort of a readability test of Beorcana.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t exist, I suppose you could contact the designer about it or ask for a free version, so that you can test it yourselve, before buying the license.</p>
<p>This Dutch/Swiss foundry you were talking about, was probably TEFF. Though all of the fonts in their library are expensive.</p>
<p>I would suggest one of the more modern (refering to time, not style) serif typefaces for Display use. Say, Calluna, Trinité, Centro Serif, etc.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I would like to do a test on Beorcana, although I have been presented with some faces that would require Beorcana to look amazingly legible in long text for me to choose it for this project (I may still grab it though, if I do not choose it, when I get the money.)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On Beorcana, I think it is a very strong version of the Carolingian minuscule—most are more delicate than what you&rsquo;d want, I think—and so would give a kind of scribal feeling. I feel that the old style of types, starting with Jenson and Griffo are more readable than this more scribal style. But Beorcana is readable, and since it is for people reading the Bible in Latin (!) I don&rsquo;t think they are going to be reading very quickly, so maximum readability it seems to me is less of a premium than getting the aesthetic you want.</p>
<p>Since you don&rsquo;t want to do a facsimile, I think it&rsquo;s really a question of what you think gives the feeling you want. And if that&rsquo;s Beorcana, go for it.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are going for a more calligraphic or scribal look, don&rsquo;t overlook Brioso Pro. I&rsquo;ve seen it used small, and was astonished how readable it is small. And it is really elegant large. And it has a panoply of weights and optical sizes. So it might be what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p>I have found Adobe&rsquo;s Jenson and Brioso, both of which are beautiful. I think Jenson is a better choice. I&rsquo;ve been trying to find the best-quality Jenson available, and from what I can tell, Adobe&rsquo;s version is the best suited for a book face. I probably would use Janek&rsquo;s face if it were complete (I think it would be good for the Aeneid as well, however)</p>
<p>I have also discovered ITC Bodoni, which, although is not what I want to use here, it is what I was looking for for something else.</p>

<p>Day Roman, which is free, doesn&rsquo;t have a matching italic. It somewhat resembles Bembo, although it&rsquo;s based on the work of a different punchcutter.</p>
<p>One might want to look at Centaur, as well, if one is interested in a typeface like Jenson. But I suspect that now that they know what you want, the professional typographers here can suggest some excellent recent alternatives for your consideration. I don&rsquo;t know offhand about Adobe Jenson, but while I thought Adobe Caslon was a good typeface, I had to admit that it was about at the very limit of how far one might get away with straying from authenticity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This does look like a rather interesting project; best of luck with it.</p>
<p>Checking our library catalogue, you might be interested to know that we have a slightly newer printing of this particular book on our shelves; it&rsquo;s been [[http://www.archive.org/details/bibliasacraexseb01cast|digitized on Archive.org]]. Something to consider, though: if you really want to take on editing the Vulgate, what the Latin world really needs right now is a more reliable electronic version of the Stuttgart text, and with actual punctuation (probably approximating what is found in the Clementine edition). Also, I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s a single version of the Vulgate on the market at the moment that is nicely typeset, uses a standard text, and that you can actually pick up and read without the mess of an extensive apparatus at the bottom. Harvard is working on one, but they&rsquo;ve made an absolute mess of the text, and the physical volumes are very cumbersome due to their size. It would be a bit of work, but it would be hugely useful, and would probably have a much wider audience than Châteillon&rsquo;s translation.</p>
<p>Personally, I would avoid printing macrons; you&rsquo;ll go crazy enough trying to proofread the Latin text even without them. (For which, I hope you know about the Correcteur orthographique du Latin?) Macrons, as you note, are terribly ugly, and really only necessary for beginners' exercises. If you&rsquo;re really concerned about correct pronunciation, I find that stress accents are more useful, and actually appear in some medieval manuscripts and early printed books; they&rsquo;re also not as difficult to mess up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Dunning - Interesting. I have a copy of the Nova Vulgata, the current official Bible of the Catholic Church - it is actually a nice edition, printed in what looks like ITC&rsquo;s New Baskerville. It is a hefty volume because the print is rather large. It contains minimal footnotes, mostly translation notes.</p>
<p>If I were to make an edition of the Vulgate (Châteillon&rsquo;s version is not a vulgate), I would make an edition of the Nova Vulgata, as it is not widely available and is the current official standard of the Church. That being said, for the Honors College at my university, I am making a translation of the Gospel of John from the Nova Vulgata, and have in my sights a complete translation of the text for devotional use and for use as an aid in other translations.</p>
<p>Of course, since the Nova Vulgata is copyrighted by the Vatican Publishing House, permissions would have to be gained from them for any such project, as well, most probably, from the local bishop.</p>
<p>I am no fan of the Stuttgart version. Adding punctuation would, I think, ruin the entire point of that edition - as its focus was to imitate a medieval manuscript.</p>
