body: "I\u2019m looking for some help on reporting a crash bug in Mac OS X and/or
  Cambria. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the font or the OS (CoreText) or both
  that are at fault here, and I have no idea where to report this problem other than
  here.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to repeat the bug:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Open TextEdit
  (happens in other apps too).</li>\r\n<li>\u2318T, change font to Cambria (I have
  v. 5.97 installed).</li>\r\n<li>Enter the following characters <em>in order</em>:\r\n
  \ <ol>\r\n  <li>U+00F3 Latin small letter O with acute</li>\r\n  <li>U+0328 Combining
  ogonek</li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>???</li>\r\n<li>Crash!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nThe
  crash happens inside of CoreText. It blows up inside of TGlyphComposer::ComposeGlyphs()
  as can be seen from the top few calls on the stack dump.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n0   com.apple.CoreText
  \           \t0x00007fff830b6c9d TGlyphComposer::ComposeGlyphs(long, TStackBuffer<unsigned
  short, 30ul> const&) + 1701\r\n1   com.apple.CoreText            \t0x00007fff830b5e7c
  TCombiningEngine::ResolveCombiningMarks() + 602\r\n2   com.apple.CoreText            \t0x00007fff8309e5d7
  TTypesetterRunArray::DoAttachments(TLine&) const + 73\r\n3   com.apple.CoreText
  \           \t0x00007fff8309e4c4 TTypesetterRunArray::TTypesetterRunArray(__CFArray
  const*, __CFString const*, void const* (*)(__CTRun const*, __CFString const*, void*),
  void*) + 228\r\n4   com.apple.CoreText            \t0x00007fff8309e2d9 CTTypesetterCreateWithRunArray
  + 97\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis only seems to happen with Cambria, and not with any
  other fonts. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s an OS problem or
  a font problem. If it\u2019s an OS problem, I have no idea where to report it. I
  guess can probably look forward to not hearing about it for a year or two, then
  being forced to upgrade to 10.7 or something. But If it\u2019s a font problem, then
  maybe someone here can help. In either case, Apple has something to fix since a
  badly behaved font should still not cause a crash.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is fairly
  simple, just using the other possible combination of diacritic and base character:
  U+01EB Latin small letter O with ogonek + U+0301 Combining acute accent. It\u2019s
  annoying to have to remember to enter things in one way and not another, and I am
  wary of other combinations of diacritics giving me problems..."

  body: "This isn't a bug per se in the font, but I can take a guess as to why it
    occurs with Cambria but not with other fonts. In order to limit the size and complexity
    of GPOS mark positioning lookups, Cambria contextually decomposes diacritic glyphs
    when followed by combining marks, enabling mark-to-mark positioning to be useable
    for stacked marks above or below. This decomposition takes place in the GSUB 'ccmp'
    feature. So, for example, rather than having to provide GPOS mark positioning
    for /acutecomb/ to /adieresis/ and all other precomposed diacritic glyphs, the
    latter is decomposed to /a/dieresiscomb/ when followed by /acutecomb/ or any other
    combining mark glyph. For the sake of lookup simplicity, this decomposition applies
    to all precomposed diacritics regardless of whether the following mark is above
    or below. So what happens in the case you describe is that /oacute/ is being contextually
    decomposed to /o/acutecomb/, triggered by the following /ogonekcomb/. I presume
    this is causing some problem for Apple's CoreText engine.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence
    to support my presumption could be found by testing another font that is built
    in the same way as Cambria, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.brill.nl/promotions/brill-fonts-end-user-license-agreement\">Brill
    Roman</a>.\r\n\r\n[We've also identified and confirmed a bug with fonts that work
    in this way in Adobe's text handlers, although this doesn't result in a crash:
    the contextual lookups simply are not applied. Adobe have confirmed this is a
    bug, but were unable to get it fixed in time for the CS6 roll-out.]"

    in the exact same function, with Brill Roman.\r\n\r\nJohn, would you be willing
    to file report this bug to Apple? I am not enthusiastic about setting up a developer
    account just to file one bug."

  body: I've heard back from Apple. My contact thinks this bug has been fixed by some
    work they did on OpenType processing for the next OS; he tested that code with
    Cambria 5.97 and was unable to reproduce your crash behaviour.

    bothersome to have things crash because I typed the order of diacritics in wrong."
