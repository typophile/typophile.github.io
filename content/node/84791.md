  body: It's not Poster Bodoni. It's probably a cut of Pistilli Roman.

  body: "It's not Bodoni Poster. That's what I had originally thought it was but the
    7 is different as well as the letters. It's very close but that's why I came here,
    to get the definitive answer on what it is. The serifs seem to extend up and out
    a little further than the Bodoni Poster font. The front of the 7 also is more
    straight up-and-down than the Bodoni version.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\n<strong>EDIT:</strong>
    Nevermind. It's Carousel OT, by Elsner+Flake.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsnerflake/carousel_ot/"
