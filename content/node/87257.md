  similar to Rockwell (though I think it is a bit more friendly) and can be viewed
  here http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk Would Gotham be a good font to
  pair with Chunk since it is geometric, but a san serif. It will be used for the
  tagline as well as any business cards, letterheads, body copy, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any advice. I am really trying to beef up my typeface expertise,
  but need some expert advice."

    grotesque would be a good match, eg Benton."

  body: "Thanks for the reply, Nick. Unfortunately I do not seem to have any fonts
    that fit that description and I am too poor to buy them. As far as I can tell,
    my oldest san serif fonts are Gill Sans and Helvetica. Unless you think either
    of those would fit in, I will try to find a free font that has the right look/feel
    to it. \r\n\r\nsigh"
