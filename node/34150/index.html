  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">One thing that scares me with children is, what if You have one and they turn out to have the worst taste in music? My plan is to brain wash them from day one minus 9 months by playing my music over and over again. I'm fairly sure they will appreciate this later on. Not too sure about the mother, though. 

On to this particular case, I assume some of you have kids and You fear they will never spot the difference between Sabon and Sabon Next, Arial and Helvetica, Frutiger and Myriad, etc. Scary awkward dinner conversations ensue as an apparent divide between generations and interests manifest.  Now we don't want that. 

I'm not saying you're doing a bad job, but just to be on the safe side I thought I'll mention a book now available in english that Mark Batty recently published; <a href="http://www.markbattypublisher.com/servlet/book_view?number=47">The Serif Fairy</a> by René Siegfried, to hopefully avoid such situations. You can still dream of a Linn Boyd-Morris Fuller kind of relationship with the kid.

Good luck!

I can only look at my family to see your upbringing doesn't have an influence on your personal taste. Best case scenario, you'll only be able to pass on your moral standards to your children and maybe spark an interest by showing them yours. Both my sisters & I all have different tastes in movies, music,... & overall different interests. I can't even seem to find a genetic reason in my entire family that explains my affection for typography, graphic design & sharks. I think the only thing you can do with your kids is to keep your fingers crossed & stimulate them in whatever turn out to be their interests.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your upbringing can have an influence when the parent's interests somehow spark a similar interest in their children, but I think all children reach a period of rebellion & nothing (or very little) of all things that were "enforced" to the child will survive. Children can definitely be molded to a certain degree, but I think it would take some serious brainwashing to make it last through puberty ;-) Like Paul said, you might be able to make children curious about things, but you have to keep in account that children will come across other sources (school & mostly friends) that will have a much bigger impact on their final interests & personality.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think brainwashing is a rather extreme term for the influence parents have on kids. 

Like Paul I was pretty lucky to have parents with wide ranging taste and natural curiosity - they took me traveling from a young age and exposed me to lots of different types of food, music, culture. But I know I was lucky in that regard.

Choz - I used to know someone whose daughter joined a cult. She had to hire someone to kidnap her back, it was hideous. But I don't think that happens often - I know two OTHER people whose parents indoctrinated them into cults, now that is brainwashing for sure. One of them was Synenon (her dad was kinda high up in the pantheon there), I don't remember the other - some flakey group in Colorado.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I proudly indoctrinated my offspring in rockist ways from an early age. Things went well, took them to their first concert, Moist, in 1993 (aged 9 and 12). That was the grunge era, guitar rock on its way back, so the universe was unfolding as it was intended. But that was shortly before they discovered raves, techno, and hip-hop. If anyone ended up being brainwashed, it's me, as I've developed some taste for "their" music, which I generally find more interesting than today's guitar rock -- been there, done that. They've always been font people, the result of working with professional graphics software, on hand-me-down Macs with large font libraries, from an early age.</div>

LMFAO. Unfortunately it's too late for my brood. Now in their teen years, they regularly print out entire reports in display faces created by eastern european teenagers with names like "Demontooth" and "Crazy Uncle." Oh if only they would even consider Comic Sans. If you'd seen the horrors that I've seen you would run, not walk, to the nearest bookstore and buy this book. You may want to pick up a book on sucessful brainwashing techniques while you're at it...

Ouch, nice. ;) Like I said, it is a mental excercise, to brace for the worst, or even, if possible, figure out how to prevent that sort of thing before hand. Meanwhile, I still feel compelled to to teach him to become more of a happy, mindless drone that I ever was.

Fredo, once I persuaded my mother to appreciate the relationship of the lyrics to the music, she became a moderate fan of Korn, and keeps the first album next to her Phil Ochs and Peter Paul and Mary. She even through some insights my way about how she relates to parts of herself she isn't completely comfortable with through it. This has followed with an interest in the Randy Rhoads-era Ozzy, and lately she beginning to think suspect might be more than Arialvetica in the sans genre of type.

My son bought their Dookie CD, which was pretty good. (That was before he discovered Aphex Twin.) And last week I was quite moved watching them perform Working Class Hero on the American Idol finale. Ruben Studdard in a business suit singing Lucy in the Sky, well, that really blew my mind!</div>

What I like about the (alleged) lyrics in trance-style
music that they're stupid, but they know they're stupid.
The don't pretend to be "deep" - all deep thought does
to music is bring it down. It's like how watching a soap
opera in a language you don't know is so much better.

On the other end of things, I still love the music I grew up listening to at home (won't mention names, don't need the rolling eyes) and a lot of the stuff I loved as a teen I kinda think, muh.

I love raffi, too. Especially when my kids sing it.

Type related: Once a week, my daughter has to write a response to a story she's read. Most of the time, she tries to rush through it, and she really doesn't have the neatest handwriting. The last time I started to get on her case for these really long descenders on the g and y. She said "but mommy, it's nice and it does swish" (making the motion with her hand). I smiled, but had to tell her to re-write parts of it that were close to illegible.

		<div class="commentbody">It's a little bit of a late reply, but I was out most of the day yesterday.
Hrant, maybe you'll find a better appreciation for lyrics if you don't see them as a whole, but break them down to little pieces? Music has always been very imortant to me (unlike for the rest of my family; combined they don't even own half of my collection & they only occasionaly listen to them whereas I àlways have my headset on at home & never leave the house without my trusted MD walkman (the best goddamn buy I ever did)) & growing up I started paying more & more attention to the lyrics as well. There are still some I find close to poetry & others that sound worse each time you listen to them, but in almost every song, there's at least one thing that touches me. Not necessarely on an emotional level, but on a linguistic level as well. It can be something very plain, but described in a beautiful way (again I'm talking mere linguistics, no emotions attached). I write texts myself (mostly in English) which are probably best comparable with lyrics (without the music to accompany it). I've still kept the ones I wrote as a teenager & even though those are really predictable & overall crappy, there's always this one perfectly formulated sentence in each of them of which I am still proud to this day. Later on, I've started "experimenting" more with ambiguous texts & starting doing a lot of "wordplay". I have seen my texts evolving immensely in a few years time & I see the same evolution in the lyrics of some of my favourite bands. Right now, I'm completely consumed by the music of "the Smashing Pumkins" again (partially due to the upcoming new album) & the lyrics are mostly quite predictable, but there's an obvious evolution in them. The funny thing with them is that for a long time I misheard one part of the lyrics from "Tonight, tonight" & I was actually a bit disappointed when I read what they really said ;-)
I have many CD's from groups that might have benifited from limiting themselves to being instrumental, but if you'll look closely enough, you'll usually find something to appreciate. I have a little notebook in which I write everything that comes to mind that I can -at one point- use in one of my texts & I've also started writing stuff down from existing lyrics hoping to try & make a "compilation text" with them someday. A lot of them kind of lose their impact in the existing lyrics & some of them might even sound bad or pointless on their own, but they can gain beauty from using them with other lyrics. It's just a matter of finding the beauty in the beast. Putting a puzzle together with pieces from different puzzles & trying to make a nice (albeit abstract) picture nevertheless.
As for learning to appreciate your parents' musical taste, I think I've developped a love for it that exceeds my moms... Like SD's dad, my mom has gone from the Stones to Boccelli-like stuff. She even comlains to me when I put the Stones on now (luckily she still likes Janis Joplin & Bob Dylan) ;-) It just goes to show that people have no definite taste & are always changing. I wouldn't call this evolving at this point 'cause it still seems to me that her taste is going downhill, but maybe I'll learn to appreciate it in time as well... Either way, I think people's personal tastes (not only in music) are always influenced by circumstances (mostly interests & the crowd you hang with), but as far a "indoctrination" goes, I don't think ànything can survive puberty, it's just plain murder in the first degree ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My son likes to have loud music in the car. He also likes me to "race" the other cars (pass them) and he is starting pressure tactics to get me to buy either a convertible or a jeep. He's 4. 

But, I like to listen to CBC so I can get the news (I don't read a daily newspaper or watch tv) and he gets very annoyed with all the talking. Occasionally I switch over to the rock station, CHOM, but often that's a lot of yapping too. More often than not, the little voice comes from the back seat asking me to turn it up at the first musical advertisement. :/ I've tried explaining it's not music, to no avail. But he also gets creeped out by the Floyd my daughter likes. He says it sounds like bad-guy music. :)

The question of how much influence we have is really interesting. I think often the most powerful influence is the one we don't really notice. The other stuff, like hoping or trying to direct them to certain interests or abilities seem to most often have little effect, except in the residual "my dad wanted me to be a doctor like him and I've been a disappointment to him ever since I decided to go into widget-making." 

I do think parents pass on deeper (bad word choice, I know) characteristics, the kind that become a large part of who they are and how they see themselves. The interests, the skills, career, etc. are, in my opinion, pretty irrelevant.

		<div class="commentbody">I think most of the influence parents have on their children is based on genetics. They can have an influence on a different, 2nd hand kind of level as in choosing the school they send their kids off to (which I personally think can have a bigger impact on children since it's the place where they spend most of their character developing years & where they meet kindred spirits in friends), exposing their children to different cultures or -in a negative way- isolating them from other ideas, beliefs etc.. Like I mentioned in my first post here, I can't seem to find any parable interests in my family, not in taste, but not even in validations of these interests. Music is -again- a great example for this; everyone in my family is only interested in it as background music, but I can simply not do without. I've had a friend over last weekend (who doesn't share my taste in music) & I was actually already freaking out at the sheer thought of not being able to listen to my music (I'm not one to enforce my taste on others). I know it sounds like I'm a complete nutcase (which I àm in certain ways), but my ears just feel "naked" without a headset. I can really enjoy just listening to music while doing nothing else, I experience every single note on a very high awareness scale. To get back to the family issue, my family just can't relate to this or any other of my interests (obsessions would probably be a better word in my case). I think I "enherited" this passion from all the friends I have (had). I still can't "place" my interst in typography though (even in my friends who share my graphic interests). Most people even get annoyed with it & think of me as some kind of freak (this word will haunt me for the rest of my life), so you can imagine my enthusiasm when I came across this site ;-)</div>

Lyrics do not necessarely have to be linked to telling you what to feel. Mostly they're telling you what other people feel & even if you can't appreciate that, there's still the linguistic part. I can give tons of examples of lyrics (or parts of them at least) that I find beautiful purely for the way they're phrased regardless of their content.</div>

I see the music/lyrics I like as someone you find attractive whether or not you know them. I don't believe in love at first sight in the most literal sense, but aesthetics don't have to have a deeper meaning in my opinion. If you think of it  as "love" at first SIGHT (emphasise the word sight & minimalize the love (body minus soul makes a different kind of love)), I think it also applies to music/lyrics (although it would have to called love at first sound ;-) ). In my emotional life I'm past that kind of "love" (but I have had my promiscuous years) & I am now looking for a little more substance, but I still find myself turning my head for some eyecandy on the street... I don't think this makes me shallow, I just draw a line between pure aesthetics & substance.</div>

And isn't it nice to be surprised to find a piece of "eyecandy" also has a sweet interior? ;-) Besides, there's usually something sweet to find inside if you just look closely enough.

		<div class="commentbody">About those "classics", I don't think "love me do" for instance could be considered great songwriting lyrical wise, but it works well within the context of the kind of music the Beatles made at that point. Music & lyrics are a reflection of the "zeitgeist" whether they're political or even personal. I have to admit today's lyrics often lack originality or are completely blown out of proportions, but even in all that pompous pretension some little treasures can be hidden. It's much like judging a book by its cover which is what most of us probably do (even if it happens on a subconscious level) & if you like the music, the chances you'll (learn to) appreciate the lyrics as well will increase. As far as that goes, I think we're all a little prejudiced, but the best you can do is to try and keep an open mind. It works both ways; if you like the exterior, it'll be easier to overcome any degree of disliking of the lyrics & a beautiful interior can help you look at the exterior in a different way. To use the analogy of love at first sight again: you want someone pretty to be a nice person (and "love" càn be quite blinding), but at the same time you can learn to love a beast purely based on its personality.</div>

In case of comedians I totally agree with NicholasGross, but as for lyrics, prose & poetry I don't. Although I don't read books, I can enjoy reading a well written piece of text (eg. a review, an interview or even the posts here on Typophile) purely based on how "fluently" it reads. If I can identify with whatever is written this will only contribute to my appreciation, but I definitely don't see it as a must. It can be nice to see how other people phrase their feelings or opinions whether or not you share them.
As for poetry and lyrics, the identification also adds to its appreciation, but is no must either. I think poetry & lyrics are open to interpretation & you often read/hear in them what you want to (maybe the innate desire of human kind to identify themselves with others (birds of a feather, you know) is responsable for a selective hearing?). At least this is what I was tought in school (and the only thing I remembered) ;-)
I like discussing lyrics to see how other people interprete them & as for my own texts, I don't really care what people read into them. I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed if they overlook all the wordplay and ambiguous elements I put into them, but I write lyrics for myself & no one else. I do share them with some people, but I always warn them they'll probably won't have a clue what they're about ;-) When writing, I always start with something personal, but usually put this in a universal context which might help people identify themselves with it a bit more.
Even I'm not arrogant enough to state I understand lyrics or poetry, but I find most art to be overexposed to interpretations in general. I can enjoy something on a sheer aesthetic level without "understanding" it. This mostly applies to paintings, drawings & basically everything visual. Written words obviously invite people to interprete (visualize) them, but I've learned to appreciate them on a pure aesthetic level as well. Something can be purely pleasing to the ear, not only the music itself, but even the lyrics.
And about my own selective hearing: when singing along to "Tonight, tonight", I still use my version ;-p

Good insight!* But in my case things on the radio or in music stores almost never qualify. Also, since I try to be interested in things beyond Me Myself & I it would be nice if they could do this concerning how I see other people, or society - but they never manage that either. For one thing, there's virtually no talk of what I might call "the darkness". The stuff one is allowed to hear (Freedom of Speech my arse) is always squeeky-clean.

But remember, I have nothing against anybody else liking lyrics.

* It seems you're echoing my theory about the popularity of certain types of music (like rap) among a certain demographic (like underpriviledged youth): because they're not able to use language well, they blast music that expresses their strong (but generally extremely simple) emotions.

No. Or I haven't encountered a good poet.

From the carseat in back, I hear, "I love Beethoven." I almost had to pull over.


Now, of course, he listens to stuff I don't understand. His ears are pierced and he dyes his hair funny. But every once in a while I catch him groovin to Jeff Buckley or the Doors or Nat King Cole before he catches himself and calls me a dork.</div>

I agree to a point, hrant, but I think it's also a pretty cynical view. While, yeah, we already know and have felt or at least understand the feeling being expressed in lyrics, another way to look at it might be to say, "Other people feel like I do. I'm not alone." 

Having said that, I cringe at inanity and often find myself feeling more embarrassed for a singer when I think, "Really? THAT's as deeply as you can feel? THAT's as eloquently as you can say that?"</div>

5. poetic spirit or feeling: The pianist played the prelude with poetry. 
6. something suggestive of or likened to poetry: the pure poetry of a beautiful view on a clear day. 


How about the poetry of a 20' croc leaping out of the water to grab a wildabeast drinking at the edge of a river.

That said, there are some people who are clever with words. Like Jack Vance, a sci-fi writer I enjoy. Some of his sentences are like poetry. I can read them over and over.

As for kids, I can't say I'm an expert, but I've seen them around. 

When kids are throwing a tantrum in the line at Walmart, I think it is the parents that need to be brainwashed:

"Your eyelids are getting heavy. When I snap my fingers you will go into a trance, (snap). Repeat after me, 'I will not make any more babies.' -then you will give me all the money in your wallet. And when you wake up the only thing that you will remember is to make no more babies."</div>

My two daughters love everything that has melody, currently, although my older gal (she turns four now), tends to like my music, which is rather Metal and Rock, I guess. She surprised my by totally liking Rebellion a few weeks ago, singing along at the top of her voice. So, a catchy refrain has advantages :-))

Concerning type, I have some posters in my house, and since children ask a lot of questions, I usually tell them something about my work. However, since both of them are still illiterate, I guess it's too early to start with typeface distinction :-)</div>

I was angry with my foe;

Night & morning with my tears;
And I sunned it with my smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright;
And my foe beheld it shine,

When the night had veil'd the pole:
In the morning glad I see

I had been doing some letterpress testing of a funny ink* and brought home some ampersands; Hrad asked for a print, and proceeded to trace the "skeleton" on it. When he showed it to me I said it was very nice, but he should also try to trace the outsides. :->  He proceeded to do so, and even though the quality was lower** I commended him heartily.

Some months later -during which time I had given him a Chinese calligraphy book- we were watching some Korean war epic on TV, and the talk turned to Japanese, at which point Hrad said he knew Japanese. I called him a liar, at which point he disappeared for a few minutes and came back with the following:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hrad-jap_4605.jpg]

When I asked him why he had used outlines instead of a skeleton like they
do in school and stuff, he said it was because he knew I like outlines.  :->

I used to make a lot of drawings for my family which they usually displayed on their fridge. When my aunt once told me I couldn't make too many drawings for her anymore since she was running out of "fridge space", I told her: "Just do what my mom does & throw some away". Apparantly the overdose of drawings I gave my mom somehow desensitized her for any emotional value of my artwork. To get back at her, I never got that "I love mom" tattoo ;-p</div>
