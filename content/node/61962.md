body: "DSType introduces some of the latest releases. Comments welcome! \r\n\r\n<strong>Dobra
  Slab</strong>\r\nDobra Slab is robust serif companion to Dobra and it's available
  in 5 weights with matching italics. Soon available for licensing.\r\nhttp://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=63\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DobraSlab_5736.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  <strong>Finura</strong>\r\nI don't even know how to describe it. I designed it by
  impulse and I wonder how it's going to be used! Soon available for licensing.\r\nhttp://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=61\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Finura_6590.gif]"

  body: "What a beauty ... Finura ... I like it! With a strange \u201Da\u201D which
    definetly refuse to collaborate ;-)  I think we are going to see this font in
    magazines or on packaging."

  body: "Thanks to all of you. Glad you liked it.\r\nThis has been a very busy year,
    so there is much more to come.\r\n\r\nI will now start to design Grossura, that
    is the opposite of Finura, a very heavy, high contrast typeface, based on the
    same master.\r\nI will keep you guys posted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDino dos Santos\r\nDSType"
