  I'm not afraid.\r\n\r\nThis is a personal logo design, it is my initials which are
  c j d. i prefer the lower case. Let me know how you feel.\r\n"

    particular reason you feel the need to make a logo out of your initials? While
    it's not such a bad idea - as a design exercise - my thoughts are you'll communicate
    more clearly...with letters as they are, and more memorably...with something unique.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Personally, I tend to make everything a bit dated. It's a shame, but I try.
    \r\n\r\nI use my initials because I have never been happy with any types of marks
    I make. So i default to a symbol that I made out of my initials. \r\n\r\nDo you
    have a recommendation by what you mean by letters as they are? Do you mean something
    simpler, maybe more typographic?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As someone else said once about one of my logos - \"it's nice, but it lacks
    the AHA moment\", i.e. it is forgettable. Yours is a nice geometrical approach
    to combining 3 letters, but that is all there is to it. \r\n\r\nHave a look, for
    example, to <a href=http://typophile.com/files/pictures/picture-2664.jpg>Ty Wilkins</a>
    logo. Or better yet, skim through <a href=http://www.helveticbrands.ch/blog/100_Brands_of_Interest/>this</a>,
    <a http://www.helveticbrands.ch/blog/100_Brands_of_Interest_II/>this</a> and <a
    href=http://www.helveticbrands.ch/blog/100brands3/>this</a>. There is plenty of
    letters only logos on these lists.\r\n"

  body: "@apankrat\r\n\r\nThanks for those links. The Ty logo is pretty excellent.
    I am through one of the helvetica brands thing and already feeling a bit inspired.
    I would like to keep the cjd aspect and im going to continue looking for some
    'aha'! "
