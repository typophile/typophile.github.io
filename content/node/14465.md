    little gathering of about 20 ... but then we kept thinking of more people that
    we needed to invite and then we worried we'd miss someone. If you are going to
    be in SF on the 20th of August please join the list!\r\n\r\n<em>Join the list
    anyway to be alerted to future events.</em>"

  body: "Greetings, everyone!\r\n\r\nFirst off, if you are interested in keeping up
    to date with future events, please go to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sfbaytype/
    and sign up. You'll receive email messages about and can participate in discussion
    about future events we'll plan. These gatherings will also be announced on Typophile,
    but the Yahoo group will have more detailed discussion not appropriate to this
    forum. \r\n\r\nOur first social event of the season is this Saturday, August 20,
    2005. Miss Tiffany is in town for the weekend, and we want to show her some of
    the beauty of SF that she didn't see during TypeCon2004. We're going to have a
    gathering on the beach, with a bonfire, marshmallows, socializing, and fun. This
    is a chance for us to get together informally and have a good time. Bring spouses,
    buddies, and other loved ones who would enjoy this. Please feel free to forward
    this message to your friends and colleagues not on this list - everyone is welcome.
    Even if you (or your friends) can't make it this time, we'd love to see you at
    future gatherings.\r\n\r\nFor this gathering:\r\n\r\nSaturday, August 20\r\nMeet
    on the beach directly in front (west) of the Beach Chalet\r\nJohn F Kennedy Dr
    & Great Hwy\r\nMap: http://shurl.org/Bonfire+Beach+Spot\r\n\r\nMeet between 4:45
    and 5:15 pm, and we'll go as a group to the site of our bonfire.\r\n\r\nThe area
    just west of Golden Gate Park is one of the few beach areas where bonfires are
    legal.\r\n\r\nWe need more firewood, kindling, and newspaper. Any firewood must
    be completely free of nails and staples and other such foreign objects. \r\n\r\nThis
    is a true potluck event. We could use one or two small grills/Hibachis (with charcoal,
    starter, etc.) to make it easier to cook - can anyone bring a grill? We plan to
    roast hot dogs, tofu dogs, marshmallows, etc., over the fire, but it would be
    great to have grills to allow us to have non-bonfire-friendly foodstuffs. We will
    supply marshmallows and other light snacks. Everyone is responsible for bringing
    their own \"real\" food (meat items, salads, sandwiches, etc. - whatever you care
    to bring for your own dinner or to share). You don't to bring something to share,
    just make sure you at least bring whatever you need to fortify yourself for the
    evening, as marshmallows are not yet recognized as one of the basic food groups.\r\n\r\nIt
    is essential that no one bring ANY glass bottles or other glass containers to
    this event. Alcohol is not  allowed on the beach, but those of you who are discreet
    in this matter should not be bothered. Best idea is to place ALL beverages in
    plastic cups, plastic soda bottles, etc, to ensure there are no problems.\r\n\r\nDress
    in layers for typical crazy SF weather - warm at times, but chilly if foggy or
    misty. Bring blankets, beach chairs, etc., whatever you want to sit on and get
    comfy with. Bring whatever else will make your time at the beach fun!\r\n\r\nPlease
    email me at tamye at typelife.com or post here to let us know that you're coming
    and what you will bring. You can also call - my # is on the typecon.com site under
    contact section for those in the know.\r\n\r\n\r\nLook forward to seeing anyone
    who can make it.\r\n\r\nWe'll plan another event for late September-ish - we'd
    like to make this a monthly gathering, so please feel free to offer your ideas
    for get-togethers and/or activities we can do together.\r\n\r\nSee you this weekend,
    or later!\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nTamye\r\n"

  body: One last thing... if you can't be there between 4:45 and 5:15, no worries.
    Just come on down later and park and walk to the beach by the Beach Chalet. You'll
    find us... we'll be the ones talking about letters instead of singing kum-bah-ya...
