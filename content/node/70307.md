body: "From time to time i had to design documents that are tri lingual, or bi-lingual.
  \r\nits almost always, spanish, english and another language, the last two were
  Chinese and Korean...\r\n\r\nUsually i receive documents in word, with the text
  in chinese, and usually i don't have problems opening it. The trouble comes when
  i  import or copy it in Indesign, because most of the times the font used by word
  is not the same that indesign uses for the same language.\r\n\r\nI understand that
  in the mac there are some system fonts that are there to be used in this cases.
  For example, for the chinese document I used the MS Mincho, and after looking carefully
  I understood that the other two fonts (MS PGothic and MS PMincho) are like te times
  and helvetica versions of this font.\r\n\r\nin this last document, I couldn export
  it to a PDF to be printed, because it said that the font had copyright  restrictions.
  It was a real problem because i had to convert to outlines almost 90 pages, and
  get me into trouble whenever i needed to make corrections (fortunately I kept the
  editable version of the document) and this meant time and money I spent making a
  PDF each time  there were corrections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 I want to know how this
  kind of fonts work, and what can I do if this chinese font (or any another) has
  copyright restrictions. Why did it had restrictions? \r\n\r\n\u2022 How does the
  kerning and leading can affect the reading in chinese? are there any basic rules
  regarding writing with chinese in an occidental way?\r\n\r\nLinks, books, mails
  etc, is very appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nLeonardo Vazquez\r\n\r\n"

    bits, which is why you have a problem embedding in a PDF. But there are some Adobe
    versions which are essentially the same and allow embedding. \r\n\r\nI believe
    at least some of these basic Adobe Chinese fonts are included with various installations
    of Creative Suite software. You might look into these in the future.\r\n\r\nSee
    also this thread: http://typophile.com/node/59688\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Korean should be relatively straightforward, as it is always set horizontally.
    Furthermore, 99% of text typefaces supporting Korean have fixed width for the
    hangul. Korean fonts often come in two flavours, fixed-width and proportional,
    where in the former even the non-hangul glyphs come in fixed widths (alphanumerics
    taking up half the width of a hangul syllable). Take care to use the proportional
    version.\r\n\r\nIn many older Korean fonts, even in the proportional version,
    the punctuation and the space character have fixed width, which results in bad
    spacing. A space exactly half the width of a hangul syllable is too big for Korean.
    In addition, the hangul syllables themselves set quite loosely because they retain
    the same width as in the fixed-width versions where each syllable has to be twice
    as wide as an alphanumeric.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of digital typesetting when
    Korean typesetters had to use such fonts, they would track the text tighter, condense
    the space character, and manually kern punctuation (Latin letters would often
    touch each other because of the global tight tracking). I'm not sure if those
    who don't read Korean can get a good enough sense of how much of these adjustments
    to make. The easiest solution would be to use the latest text font offerings from
    Korean foundries with better default spacing."

  body: "Johnseong, but tell me, do the spacing and leading criteria we use in occidental
    text formatting, can we use it in Korean too, this is, adjust tracking for a line
    to fit. Ive noticed that its monospaced.\r\n\r\nIn the other hand, the leading
    is there a standard (ex. body10, leading 12) does the leading affects the reading?\r\n\r\nIs
    there hypenation in Korean?\r\n\r\nSorry so many questions :S\r\n\r\nThank you
    for your post\r\n\r\nL."

  body: "The same spacing and leading principles apply in Korean, but it is considerably
    easier since Korean line breaks can come after any letter (each 'letter' represents
    a syllable). Since long words don't wreck havoc with the line spacing, this also
    means that hyphenation is not needed for Korean, it almost always makes sense
    to full-justify, and there are no rivers running through Korean text.\r\n\r\nCheck
    that the software you are using is breaking Korean text correctly. This is really
    important!\r\n\r\nYou can adjust tracking for a line to fit, but if you do, do
    it ever so slightly so that there is no noticeable difference between the tracking
    of different lines. The justification should be achieved mostly through varying
    the spaces anyway.\r\n\r\nAs for the global tracking, a good rule of thumb is
    to make it so that the central horizontal lines of \uC744\uC744 almost or just
    barely touch. As for leading, what works for Latin text generally should work
    for Korean text. Korean fonts also contain Latin glyphs, so you can test with
    them."
