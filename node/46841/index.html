<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm designing a website for a friend of mine who is a pastor of a Pentecostal church in my town. Although designing a logo is not part of the job, the logo that he gave me to work with is completely horrid. I think it's one of those $99 for a church logo deals, where you select the logo and text you like and they come up with a "customized design" just for your church. I know: I should be careful doing this. Direct, positive and constructive criticism would be appreciated!

<div class=commentbody>I don't go to church, so this could be a complete generalization, but isn't the pentacostal church more of an old-timey fire and brimstone kind of thing? That logo is very modern. Maybe they're looking to attract a more modern audience, but it seems like that would be more appropriate for one of the new mega churches.
Anyway, the kerning is uneven, and if those are flames, I'm not sure what they represent.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the feedback. I'm particularly interested in the perspective of people who don't go to church, since this will help me avoid churchy cliches.
This is not a final design, so I'll work on the kerning later, but thanks for pointing that out.
The flames reference Pentecost, the Christian holiday that celebrates the coming of the Holy Spirit like tongues of fire to the disciples of Jesus (cf. Acts 2). Pentecostalism is a varied worldwide movement of Christianity, of which the old-time fire-and-brimstone style is only one type. This church does not fit that mold. Could a modern design fit a church that is neither fire-and-brimstone nor a mega-church?
The congregation is made up of a good number of families, but there is also a significant population of younger people, so I was thinking a modern direction would be more appropriate. The pastor is not your typical minister. He's a 30-something guy who is into a lot of hardcore and rock music, and so I think it fits his personality as well. Thoughts?

Perhaps something like Akzidenz Grotesk could be fit for this job?

<div class=commentbody>@Ross: Thanks for the critique about positioning and leading of the type. These seem like minor issues compared to your observation that the proportions between the text and mark seem wrong, however. Could you be a bit more specific about what is causing the lack of harmony? Also, are you suggesting I start over with my type treatment, or with the whole project?
@Sharon: Yes, you hit the nail on the head. It sounds like people need to hear some teaching about grace. Anyway, for those who missed my explanation from before, read [[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:1-4;&version=51;|this passage from Acts]] to see what I'm using as my material.

<div class=commentbody>I think that part of the problem is what sharon mentioned about the left flame and the middle flame. also, i can imagine in your color solution having red or orange or yellow for the flames, but right now they feel heavy next to your selection of type. I would try outlining the flames. This would add an interesting image to type relation, especially if they weren't treated with an even line weight, but more organic feeling.
also, i would think about putting that type all on one line, it doesn't look good broken up right now, at least the way you are doing it with all lower case letters.</div>

Gill has a long and solid history, but maybe there is something more contemporary?

http://www.wyd2008.org/
It's for World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney, from what I can gather is a big Christian youth event.
Their logo may help you as it references the fire of the Holy Spirit as well as the Cross and the Sydney Opera House, plus looks quite nice, well to me at least.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Nick, what I meant with regard to the proportions of the elements was mostly to do with their weights. The example you posted above with the flame outlined looks more balanced to me.
Great idea from David about achieving correct negative space in the flames.

<div class=commentbody>I agree with the comment at looking at flames for reference, it seems to look more like a water drop with all the flames funneling and shaping in toward the top most point.
the middle flame probably has the most flame-like shape to it. try to move the left and right flames up and down so that they don't quite line up so much at the top and bottom. it will add tension and interesting visual space if they don't line up so much.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Try getting rid of the rightmost flame and rotating the other two a couple of degrees counterclockwise.

<div class=commentbody>Darnit, it just came to me.
The overall flame should be similar in shape to a W and the 2 outer pieces should be similar to Cs. That way it sublty has the initials of the church.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks David. Among the very good input I've received on this thread, your advice has stood out as both honest and helpful throughout. I've been mulling over the "W flame" idea but the project has been put on hold for a bit. I'll come back soon with an update.
