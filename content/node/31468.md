body: "Hello Typophile\r\nI search on Typophile didn\u2019t give me anything on this
  problem:\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a sans serif and during conversation with
  a fellow typedesigner he posed the question if I should group the characters by
  likeness and then harmonize the width of those characters by group, in order to
  achieve a better or more harmonious rhythm? Something rang a bell, and in Walter
  Tracy\u2019s \u2018Letters of Credit\u2019 p.72 I did find a system that does exactly
  that, but only for adjusting the sidebearings, not the total character width, nor
  the width of the character sans sidebearings.\r\n\r\nThen I took a look within Univers
  and Frutiger to see if there was a system, and indeed there was. There was a clear
  set of different groups of character widths (incl. sidebearings). Univers\u2019
  a e v x y all had a width of 556 units, while b d h n o p q u had a width of 611,
  and so on. Same deal with Frutiger. Other faces has the same pattern visible to
  a lesser or greater extent.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is of course how such a width adjustment
  would change the shape of the individual character.\r\n\r\nMy question is whether
  fewer groups with more characters grouped together and adjusted to the same total
  character width are better than more groups with fewer characters? My intuition
  tells me that there probably is a sweet spot somewhere in between the extremes,
  but where, and are there some pointer on where to go other than trail and error?\r\n\r\nClaus
  Eggers S\xF8rensen\r\n\r\nPS: I hope I\u2019m making sense here, as it is getting
  rather late."

  body: "I am not sure what the reasons were for Univers & Frutiger having standardized
    sidebearings. There are potentially many reasons. One reason is that making a
    type design rationalized saves time. Another reason might be that doing that would
    accord with the deisgn spirit of the time in which they were designed. Also, design
    for linotype machines was far stricter than digital design is and it may have
    been an approach that was habitual. A type historian can nail this down better
    than I can. \r\n\r\nBut you asked 'I should group the characters by likeness and
    then harmonize the width of those characters by group, in order to achieve a better
    or more harmonious rhythm?' And the answer can only be 'maybe'. Because in depends
    on intent. Ceratinly that is not the only way to do it. But it is one way. There
    are so many variables in type that nailing down a few of them so you don't go
    crazy does have an appeal. ;-) But the final aribiter is your own eye.\r\n\r\n<cite>
    Another thing is of course how such a width adjustment would change the shape
    of the individual character.</cite>\r\n\r\nYour right, everything impacts everything
    else. It might be that you find designing in a Fruigter mode is too constraining.
    Cetainly there are ways of making a pleasing face in terms of optical balance
    without doing that. \r\n\r\nWhat I think you will not find is that there is a
    single sweet spot. The reasons that standards are there have more to do with expediency
    and philosophy and specific purpose, and aesthetic intent than because there is
    a single ideal. Less still that a single technique can be ideal in all cases.
    \r\n\r\nOpen more faces and analyze them. What do you find?\r\n\r\nWhat might
    be interesting too is to look at different kinds of blackletter. Look at examples
    of Bastarde. Look at Textur,  Schwabacher etc. Look at how they vary in terms
    of their regularity. Textur is really regular for instance - that was the visual
    ideal the scribes had in mind. How ideal do you think it is? I mention blackletter
    in part because I have been looking at them alot recently & in part because it's
    relative unfamiliarity ( at least to me ) makes it a great vehicle for recognizing
    & comparing differing approaches to letter/word making.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the
    face you are working on, have you posted it here for review?"

  body: 'The groups are not necessary. The identical widths could be an artifact of
    a previous type manufacturing technology that required a "unit system". Those
    unit systems typically forced designers to distort their designs. It wasn''t preferred,
    it was a manufacturing constraint.  Keeping sidebearings of similar features makes
    sense, and keeping similar letters at similar widths is good (n and u, d and q),
    but that is a visual thing, and not reqired. Excessive regularity and identical
    character shapes don''t bring anything of great value to a typeface unless it
    is a very modular display design. If it''s something like Impact, where the counters
    should be twice the sidebearings, in order to achieve even regimented spacing,
    then that''s visually evident. The overarching proportional relationships between
    all the letters is a more important issue for most typefaces. '

  body: "You have already read Tracy's view of spacing, which seems to be the most
    generally accepted. According to him the side bearings of the control characters
    H and n should be slightly less than the width of the counters, and the other
    letters matched to these. \r\n\r\nFrutiger <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/793-12659/walterkaechs.html\">says
    here</a> that in a seriffed face, the width between the counters and the total
    of the side bearings should be equal in a seriffed face--wider than what Tracy
    recommends. I haven't read Frutiger's books, but he may state there his theory
    about sans faces--I'm sure he has such a theory, given how deliberate he is about
    his designs. \r\n\r\nOther theories about spacing have been put forward by David
    Kindersley. His starting point was different, as his basis was the blacks of the
    letter, not the whites. \r\n\r\nHermann Zapf developed an automatic spacing system
    based roughly on the same approach of Tracy--looking at counters of control letters.
    He also took into account nearest proximity in letters like r, etc. The program
    he and others developed was bought by Adobe and became the basis of its 'optical
    spacing'. \r\n\r\nThere is also an Italian engineer who has developed an automatic
    system called <a href=\"http://www.iginomarini.com/ikern.html\">IKern</a>. I don't
    know how that works. \r\n\r\nIn spite of a lot being known about spacing, I think
    there is still a lot that is mysterious, and just has to be done by trial and
    error, with your eye and other faces you admire as guides. "

    so much anyway, there is not much value in it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I should add that in designing a face you don't have the characters in a
    finished form first, and then space afterwards. There is, as Tracy notes, an interactive
    process where you adapt the characters so that they will space well. So you are
    looking at rhythm, evenness of color, the relationship between blacks and whites,
    and so on. And you adjust both the character and spacing to make these work, within
    your brief and design ideas. \r\n\r\nSo although the guidelines are very helpful,
    it ends up like everything else in type design, as Carl and Chris say, with the
    eye as final arbiter.  "
