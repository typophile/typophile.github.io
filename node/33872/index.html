<p>Seems Rebekka is right!</p>
<p>The current trend for companies stealing photos and not paying has gotten out of hand.</p>
<p>This morning on TV the BBC News ended a story about this weeks FA Cup final with a request for people to send in there images from the days event. Gee that is a cheap way to get content. No need to send out photographer or pay them for that matter.</p>
<p>Then there are the prowlers who ask to use your photos for their applications. I get request all the time.</p>
<p>Many of my clients ask me to send some high res images to magazines and I get no credit usually.</p>
<p>Stop the open source style stealers, save a photographer today.</p>

<p>Well, I guess it was bound to happen. I just discovered while perusing my stat page, that a Turkish? Photoshop site had pasted in my thumbnail tables, complete with links to the source images on my host&rsquo;s server, making their own free photo site using only my photos and bandwidth. And filled it chock full of Google ads.</p>
<p>And then I saw they had just made an English version, also using my bandwidth. There is <em>always</em> someone who will abuse a good thing.</p>
<p>Conveniently, there is no contact option on their pages, although the site seems fairly sophisticated otherwise.</p>

Or Microsoft finding photos for their Vista wallpaper on Flickr and commissioning a couple of the Flickr photographers to fill it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a two-way street: some people get ripped off, and others get noticed and compensated. I&rsquo;d rather lose a few images to the WWW and gain a few photo clients than never take the chance at all. Not that it&rsquo;s balanced or fair, but it is not black and white either (no pun intended).</p>
<p>At my design shop, we use Flickr for comping now more than Getty because of its quality, quantity, resolution, and reality. And I think the day draws near when we buy a photo from somebody there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There&rsquo;s also a really creepy side to flickr for anyone posting photos of kids. Seriously. Plenty of discussion on there for those who care to look into it, and of course opinions vary. I took all my pictures off and reposted them as private to ensure that they were only viewable by family and friends because of some insane activity on 2 or 3 pictures of my kids. (I was advertising my apartment for rent, but the pictures of the apartment were getting less hits than those 2 or 3 of the kids which had my son in his undies in the water fountain and my daughter eating a popsicle.)</p>
<p>Regardless where your opinion lies on the subject, it is better to make an informed decision than uninformed one, I think.</p>

This may be rhetorical, but I was then struck by this thought:
Who owns the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to graffiti art? The artist?  the buiding owner? the photographer that chronicles it?</p>
<p>Example: it is perfectly legal to photograph the Eiffel Tower during the daylight hours and sell the photos as copyrighted images. It is illegal to photograph the tower at NIGHT and sell the images, because the company that illuminates the tower has copyrighted the lighted aspect of the site. No one is required to credit Gustave Eiffel (although this is most likely a Public Domain issue, due to the date, etc.).</p>

<p>Who owns the “rights” to graffiti art?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have wondered the same thing. I was approached by Paramount Pictures requesting the use of my graffiti photos in a dancing movie that recently came out (the sequel to &ldquo;Save the Last Dance&rdquo; with Julia Stiles), and I signed their release with the caveat that I don&rsquo;t know what right the graffiti artists may have, so they use them at their own risk. I noticed my photos weren&rsquo;t in the movie.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, all for one and one for all, and all that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is man&rsquo;s nature to deal with in this real world, which negates all semblance of <em>ideal</em>.</p>
<p>In this world, however, I imagine then artists would have an even  harder time surviving without another gig?</p>

<p>An old and tired argument - the value of self-worth.</p>
<p>When work (ie photography) is protected by law, you must push your own creativity. Proprietary rights help drive/push the creative process - not diminish it. And in return proprietary rights strengthen democracy as a &lsquo;whole&rsquo;. And it&rsquo;s the free association of Individuals which makes a democracy great. And then if the Individual wants to freely contribute their work, there should be websites which allow for that give and take.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed by how many people don&rsquo;t vote &hellip;sigh.</p>
<p>Did Garcia ever make it to Burning Man, <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">http://www.burningman.com/</a> , the celebration of the Individual&rsquo;s creative spirit?</p>

They sure would. A point that can be made, however is that everything is a matter of appropriation anyway. There is no art, thought, musing, song, scientific discovery, etc. that is not the direct result of other things. It may be &ldquo;new&rdquo; in that it&rsquo;s somewhat diffferent &ndash; another way to phrase something, a different color combination that really makes it appear unique &ndash; but at the root, it&rsquo;s modification.
Even many designers make this point: Art Chantry, and Andy Warhol each borrow(ed) freely from surrounding culture. Milton Glaser&rsquo;s famous DYLAN poster is a direct modification of Marcel Duchamp&rsquo;s work. Mozart, Bach, Beethoven each produced great numbers of pieces derived from the work of others, and not only is it accepted, it&rsquo;s celebrated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree, jlt. The marketplace is changing VERY quickly, and those who catch it ahead of the curve are going to make some serious strides. For instance, there&rsquo;s a young artist producing video diaries of her painting process, interspersed with &ldquo;journal&rdquo; entries about her life that week. She&rsquo;s been doing this for several months, starting with about 1,000 views per week. Now she&rsquo;s getting 600,000 views in a week, and selling her paintings and prints of those painting on eBay. It&rsquo;s an incredibly creative business model! I can imagine sometime very soon, she will be extremely wealthy and pretty famous. And it looks like she&rsquo;s about twenty two yrs. old.</p>
<p>As for you&ndash; I applaud your freelance success AND your marketing view as well.</p>
<p>Having said all that, the original poster called attention to someone on Flickr that specifically did NOT offer their work for free use, but had it taken anyway. That example has nothing to do with conservative and inflexible business models. That&rsquo;s stealing.</p>

<p>However, with his rallying cry to &ldquo;Stop the open source style stealers,&rdquo; Vince Connare reiterates the argument he&rsquo;s made at least twice previously: that CC licensing, other cooperatively-made and freely distributed projects (i.e., sourceforge, project gutenberg, openoffice, etc.) and the open source movement in general are a bad idea and won&rsquo;t ever produce anything worthwhile.
