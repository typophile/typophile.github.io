<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am working on a logo for Evergreen Farm. Basically they buy horses, train them, and sell them. They want a logo for their website, signage, etc. It is still in black and white and line form. I will probably add something to the bar on the E (because it feels bare). <br> <br>I am using Runic MT for the font, and Caslon 540 for the secondary font. I chose Runic because I feel it is sharp and classy. I was looking at Layfeyette (Font Bureau) and Acolyte (Altered Ego) as possibilities, but I don't own either. Before I make a purchase I want to hear opinions on the font choice. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26136.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>I, too, think it needs the cross bar. Right now, I don't see an 'E'. Otherwise, I think it's quite nice. 'Farm' might be a bit too small in comparison to Evergreen when reproduced at small sizes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the E; the horse looks strong. <br> <br>I agree with Daniel and Darrel that it would be worth it to try it with the cross bar. What does it look like small? Some of those lighter lines inside the horse may disappear in small or low rez situations. <br> <br>Runic is a good choice. Can't wait to see it in color. </div>

<div class=commentbody>This image is at 350 pixels. I can't imagine it needing to go any smaller. some lines at 350 definitely get lost but I don't think it hurts it too bad. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26209.gif alt> <br> <br>Someone suggested when I started that I add a bar. I believe that adding any sort of bar hurts the cleanness of the overall image and adds confusion. Unless a second bar is added perpendicular to the horizontal bar, the bar is floating. If a vertical and horizontal bar is added it is alot of straight lines to take away from the "E". In a way, I was hoping it almost looks like the horse is jumping over the bottom beak (of the E). That may be a stretch considering he is so far from it. It may be the right thing to add a jumping bar. I will toy with it and see if I can't make it work. <br> <br>When I straighten the leg anymore than it is it takes away from the momentum of the horse jumping. Most associate that pose with the horse jumping. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26210.gif alt> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26211.gif alt> <br> <br>Also, I adjusted the shadow on the leg so it could adapt better when the logo is smaller. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26212.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>The thin lines will get you not when they disappear, but then they <i>clot together</i>. You'll need a lo-fi version. <br> <br>I wouldn't add the middle bar - I think it's enough of an "E". <br> <br>Do remove the trapping from the Runic (like in the armpits of the "N"). <br> <br>I don't think the "FARM" font is working with the Runic. Try something like Bank, or Blair, and at a darker weight. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have adjusted the logo so it can go smaller by adding more white space inside the outer edge and simplified the shading.

<div class=commentbody>Tom, try moving the horse up and making it smaller, extend its leg and have it over lap the cross bar of the E covering most of it up. These are just suggestions for you to look at, maybe you already have.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here is the logo with some color. I am still playing with it. I decided to not try and make the horse leg more obvious that it is the bar on the "E". Because the type will always be with it people getting the association doesn't make or break the logo.

<div class=commentbody>Looking at my display I'd prefer a slightly more saturated green, but that means virtually nothing (and I don't have a Pantone book). <br> <br>In the lo-fi version do try to keep that nice parallel between the mane and the spikes in the stem - probably just by making them fewer and larger. You might also make the whole thing a bit wider. <br> <br>BTW, I just looked at the spacing for real: your "EVE" needs to be closed up a hair. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>keep that nice parallel between the mane and the spikes in the stem</i> <br> <br>I agree <br> <br>Here is the logo with more color kick. After I posted I realized how desaturated it was. I am using Pantone 371 for the green and 1205 for the light gold. Also, is the spacing better between the EVE? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26601.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Tom: <br> <br>The revised illustration is wonderful! <br>Nice work! I'm warming up to it not <br>having a cross-bar. I still don't think <br>it reads as an 'E' but the mark, itself <br>is strong and perhaps that is all that <br>matters. <br> <br>Still, I couldn't leave well enough <br>alone and had to try one idea.
