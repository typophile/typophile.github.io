body: "Jelle Bosma's Cambria uses a contextual replacement of the letter f with a
  variant that has a shorter tail when followed by ascending letters such as i, b,
  k, l, h, f, or by accented letters. This seems to be an elegant technique which
  avoids the need to making multiple ligatures. \r\n\r\nWhich other typefaces use
  that kind of technique? (Not necessary just for f, but also to resolve some other
  conflicts such as with the letters g or y). \r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    Aramara Chromatic also uses alternative j."

    solution for issues in german where many ligatures are not welcome.\r\n[[http://aldusleaf.org/|Crimson
    Text]] will use it too. In combination with german locl rules, this reduces the
    number of ligatures you would have to brake up manually."

  body: Note that the dot on top of the i used by Nicolas Jenson was pushed to the
    right so that it wouldn't bump into the kern from a preceding f or long s. This
    avoided the need either for alternate forms or for ligatures - but this was seen
    as a failed solution, and since then, Roman types had ligatures, or, much later,
    buttonhook f's.

    to resemble Sabon by URW++ called Savoy and it has and \uFB01 ligature, where
    the f-descender is not touching the i. Available on fontspring."
