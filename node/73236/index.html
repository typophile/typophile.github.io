  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm fascinated by the sheer power that is (apparently)available with FontLab.  However, the price is...daunting, shall we say, for someone who is interested in learning the craft as an avocation (I'm an engineer, and I see typography as an opportunity to apply math in a nearly-pure form).  Where and how might I obtain a used copy that I can purchase for a relatively modest price to try out (not interested in the demo version since I want to experience full functionality)?  Any suggestions?

I've posted on eBay, with no results, by the way.  And I balk at downloading from any of the repositories like RapidShare: too high a probability of a virus/trojan, never mind that it's unethical/illegal.

Thanks in advance.</div>

Since you are using Windows you might want to try this range of font editors:
www.cr8software.net/type.html

There are three 'levels': Type light (free - basic editor), Type 2.2 (more advanced, with transformations, kerning etc) and Type 3.0 (which includes OpenType features and action scripts).

I wrote these myself, and like yourself I am from a scientific/technical rather than design background.

A benign ignorance, soon corrected by experience. Almost every glyph must be modified from simple geometry to look good, or even to look geometrical. There may be formulas underlying what looks "right", but we are very, very far from finding them.

		<div class="commentbody">Andrew (1985), have you drawn type? 

Circles can't be circular to look circular, nor squares square, nor rounds the same dimensions as squares. Dividing in half vertically visually is not equal in measure, horizontals and vertical strokes that are equal in width don't look so, and on and on. And this is the simplest stuff. 

One of the most astonishing things to me I have learned in drawing type is that what we see is not what is on the page. Our brain's interpretation of data is a *huge* contributor to what we see, and that is not well understood yet.  </div>

William, maybe the original poster is thinking of a different way of applying maths than you are?

Maths and fonts can have many relations:

It can be <cite>prescriptive</cite> like in the constructions of the renaissance – this does not work, as we know, and I guess this is what you were thinking of. This is what mathematicians call a <cite>sufficient condition</cite> for what looks right.

It can be used to describe a <cite>necessary condition</cite>, like in the [[http://remix-tools.com/|RMX Harmonizer]], and I personally belive this is relevant and useful.

It can be used to <cite>process shapes</cite>, like the other RMX tools or MM or Superpolator do, and again, I think it does so successfully.

Finally, maths can be used as a <cite>medium</cite> in which to describe or store shapes (i.e. Bézier curves), and since we are working on the computer, this kind of maths application is not only sensible but inevitable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would no doubt be very interesting for you John (1940LaSalle) to read Donald Knuth's epos on TEX and METAFONT. He came at it from the very same angle you did. Reading these books will inform you and save you a great deal of time. The collected tomes come i a handy box-set: 'Computers & Typesetting, Vol. A-E, Millennium Boxed Set". Another great book by Knuth is his 'Digital Typography' a sort of digest version of the box show here:

I took the original poster to be saying that type design itself is "pure" mathematics. And as of yet, not that much of mathematics of the visual-processing side of reading is understood, so the eye must be the arbiter.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks to one and all for your comments.  The truth of the matter is, I don't know how I'll wind up using math and font design together!  I suspect a lot of it will be applications of analytic geometry, but that remains to be seen.

@ berkson: I suspect strongly that you're on target.  That is, (let's say) analytic geometry will get the basic forms delineated, but there will likely be the aesthetic aspect of "that doesn't quite look right somehow" that will yield modifications.  So it'll be a blend (not sure what proportions) of math, engineering and art.  Sue me...:-)

And all of that, sports fans, is why I'd like to see if I could find a discounted or older used version of FontLab to give it a whirl and check out some ill-formed, hazy theories.</div>
