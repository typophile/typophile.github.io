I’m designing a sans-serif and wonder if I might get any input from the pro’s. 
It’s got more or less two weights right now, and you can test it in this typetester here:</p>
<p>[[http://www.doubletwo.net/MiloTest/Index.html]]</p>
<p>I would be very pleased if you got some feedback for me.</p>
<p>lec</p>
<p>And please ignore the name &ldquo;Milo&rdquo;, I know there is a typeface out there with that name. This was the first came into my mind so it’s a kind of workingtitle.</p>

<p>I am planning some condensed and maybe ultra-condensed weights too. I want to try out the whole range of multiple master functionality.</p>
<p>And i am not sure with the dot above the i and j and rounded punctuation. Maybe squarish would be better for that?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good-looking stuff generally. I would definitely have a look again at the /g/ in the black version - considering your carefully-crafted colour correction (maybe on the verge of being too thinned) on the /N/, that ear is way too heavy, and the link feels a bit weak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also have another look at the various white sections, again problematic in /g/ but also feeling a bit weird in many other bowled letters in the black. In the /e/, for instance, it looks optically futher left than the tail. In the /b/ and /d/ it feels diagonally leaned.</p>
<p>One thing you seriously need to go through, in both weights, is the baseline appearance - some letters (notably thin /t/) have too much overhang, while others, like thin /O/, have too little.</p>

Yes, i corrected the /N/ because it was way too heavy, maybe little too strong. :)
And you are right with the bowls&hellip; i&rsquo;ll check that.</p>
<p>In deed I did not looked closer at the baseline, very good tip.</p>

And are you making changes to the active/linked font file?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not seen anyone put their fonts up for critique in this way :-)</p>
<p>My modest input: The counters in the black version seem very small. Letters such as the /c/ are quite different between weights, the light is much rounder. Some characters are necessarily different (/f/) but I think the /c/ could share some more DNA with it&rsquo;s light counterpart. Feel free to disagree.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>oh, i thought the layout would explain the functionality for itself. 
i&rsquo;m a little into flash-actionscripting, so i thought it would be cool to create a simple display tool for showing my fonts. it would be cooler if i only had to put the fonts into a seperate folder or somthing but i have to embed them. but then its really nice i think. but there is a little bug its kind of limited to a maximum fontsize. i dont know what that comes from. gotta check that. (maybe ;))</p>
<p>btw: i have uploaded a newer version, have a look at that maybe its a bit better.

<p>If you want to name a font Milo in the privacy of your home, go nuts. But you shouldn&rsquo;t be putting a font out in public with the same name as a published font. Even if it&rsquo;s just a working title. Even if your font is still in development. Leaving aside the legal &amp; trademark issues — this is basic good sportsmanship.</p>

Cap X in the bold  looks clumsy compared with the nicely worked inktraps in W and V

Maybe interpolate and make it a bit lighter.</div>
