body: "I'm working on a piece that has multiple levels of contact information.\r\n\r\nThe
  largest that I've come across is set up this way:\r\n\r\nName* - Bold\r\nTitle*
  - Small Caps Bold\r\nProgram Title - Medium\r\nBuilding/Department\r\nAddress\r\nAddress\r\nAddress\r\nPhone
  Number*\r\nInternal Phone Number*\r\nFax Number*\r\nInternal Fax Number*\r\nEmail*\r\nWeb
  Address\r\n\r\n*Most common contact information.\r\n\r\nStructurally, what would
  be a good way to layout this out. I've used tables in the past to align all the
  phone numbers and email address, where I'd use the titles \"phone\", \"dsn\" (internal
  phone), \"fax\" , \"email\" would be in the right column and the numbers and address
  in the left column. \r\n\r\nI tend to Bold the Name and Small Caps Bold the Title
  everything else is Medium or Normal weights.\r\n\r\nAlso, what's the norm for laying
  out phone numbers and emails. I tend to used the (000) 000-0000 and emails are always
  lowercase user@site.com. Is there any tracking standards?\r\n\r\nI hope that isn't
  too confusing. Thanks."

  body: "Are we talking business cards here? That is a lot of lines, and I would work
    out some way to minimize them. Can you get the address down to two lines ... one
    for the street related bits, and the other for city, state, code, country, etc.
    Phone numbers can also be placed two or more per line. As for whether to align
    or otherwise, that is a design decision, not something you want to standardize.
    Sometimes it will work best aligning the second phone number on a line to something,
    other times, not so much.\r\n\r\nAs for phone numbers, I tend to use your example,
    but many designers are now omitting the brackets and/or hyphens. I have seen center
    dots replacing the hyphens as well."

  body: "No, not business cards. It's all part of my fact sheet hoopla. Most of the
    contact information is related to military installations, which could have 4-5
    lines just for the address. I'd like to be able to par it down, but since I'm
    not providing the content, I have to work with what is provided.\r\n\r\nI just
    wanted an idea of an ideal layout. I'm currently fitting everything into a small
    box in the bottom corner of the fact sheet.\r\n\r\nMy inexperience is showing
    quite a bit with this project. Plus, since these are for the military, being creative
    isn't a positive. This would be easier if I had a style guide to follow with rigid
    parameters."
