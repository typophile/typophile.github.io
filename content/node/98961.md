  once knew the name to this font, something with \"Gothic\" at the end of the name
  ;-) \u2026 and no, it's not Trade Gothic Gothic Extended. \r\n\r\nTwo hints: \r\n\u2013
  I remember that this is a font that does not feature any lowercase letters, only
  uppercase.\r\n\u2013 the watch-manufacturers from \"wempe\" are using an adapted
  version of this font: http://www.wempe.de/ \u2013 the problem is, they call it \"wempe
  gothic\", so this doesnt solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help you
  guys!"
