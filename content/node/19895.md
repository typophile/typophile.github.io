    no wilting lily) the more it's OK to infuse that script with attributes of another.
    Plus English is the current lingua franca*, so it's used for almost everything,
    including tons published outside the West, so it's almost unavoidable. I would
    in fact suggest a \"Hellenized\" font for this, as long as style doesn't totally
    overpower functionality. But I can only think of two good ones: Skia; and something
    once shown to me by Michail Semoglou with elegant, well-crafted forms.\r\n\r\n*
    Next up: Mandarin. South Americans being ahead of the curve in that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Elements of Typographic Style (3rd ed.), especially pp. 106-113 and 273-278. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    have a look at the opening credits for the film Code 46.  They are typographically
    very clever and the approach might work very well for your project.\r\n\r\nIf
    you like what you see in Code 46, or otherwise choose to use Greek as well as
    Latin characters, Bringhurst has useful suggestions on choosing complementary
    typefaces."

    edition, not sure if the paperback is designed the same way. \r\n\r\nIf you aren't

    to his <a href=\"http://www.peterkochprinters.com/show.php?bookid=3\" target=\"_blank\">Parmenides</a>
    there is some fairly thorough discussion on the movement from the ancient, unicameral
    & atonic Greek to the bicameral & polytonic form, and back to the ancient form
    with the type designed for the Parmenides book. An interesting read to anyone
    interested in fine book printing & production, but likely particularly useful
    for you."

  body: "One thing one should be aware of when alluding to Greek is false friends,
    i.e. glyphs that look identical to Latin characters but linguistically have nothing
    to do with them. This especially concerns P and X. For example, I always get annoyed
    when I see <a href=\"http://www.parkhaus-kenzingen.de/index.php\">this pseudo-Greek
    logo</a> used by a local club in Southern Germany (logo is in the upper right-hand
    corner). It's obviously supposed to spell \"EXODUS\", but it really reads something
    like \"echodths\". It looks mixed-up and silly.\r\n\r\nAs a completely unrelated
    piece of trivia, my impression from holidaying in Greece is that the number plates
    of Greek cars only use glyphs which are shared by both scripts. This means that
    they are limited to the fourteen letters ABEHIKMNOPTXYZ. (I suppose C would also
    qualify if one is prepared to stretch the rules a little, but it does not seem
    to be used.) Presumably the Greek traffic authorities don't expect foreign police
    officers to be able to deal with a xi or an omega in a Greek registration, while
    Cyrillic countries seem to have no qualms about using their characters."

    some old cursive greek fonts so i decided thats  the path to follow, as i said

  body: "You have probably considered these issues, but here are some things that
    I would be thinking about in relation to this design, which I assume is the title
    of the film:\r\n\r\nWill the film be seen on a large theatre screen or a relatively
    small television screen?  If the former, does it nevertheless need to be made
    in a way that is consistent with television viewing?\r\n\r\nWhat is the aspect
    ratio of the frame and how does this affect the design of the credits?  If it
    is 16x9 (widescreen), is it nevertheless necessary to protect for 4x3 (the aspect
    ratio of the vast majority of television screens)?  Or, if you are shooting 16x9,
    will it be letterboxed for TV?\r\n\r\nWill the credits be computer generated using,
    eg., Adobe AfterEffects, or will they be photographed? If photographed, are you
    concerned that a white/light background may show dust/dirt when projected/broadcast
    at viewing size?  If photographed with a film camera, what is the emulsion's grain/resolution
    like at the anticipated enlargement(s)?  If photographed with a video camera,
    what quality/resolution?\r\n\r\nAs a rough benchmark, it is useful to know that
    super 16 film and high definition video have similar resolution.  Thirty-five
    mm is better and super 8, standard 16 and standard definition video are worse.
    \ If the credits are going to be photographed with a consumer video camera, it
    might be a good idea to do a test before going further down this road.  You might
    or might not be satisfied with the results. \r\n\r\nWill the credits be run on
    their own against a solid screen (what colour?) or superimposed over or beside
    photographic images?  In other words, will there be something on the screen, other
    than type, competing for attention?\r\n\r\nHow many seconds will the audience
    have to grasp the title of the film?\r\n\r\nDo you plan to do all of the credits
    this ornately?  If so, how many credits are there and how long will each of them
    be on screen?  If not, what kind of type will be used for the balance of the credits/end
    credits? \r\n\r\nHave you considered making overt use of Euclid's postulates in
    the credits?\r\n\r\nI still think that you should have a look at the credits for
    Michael Winterbottom's Code 46 :). In your case, the Code 46 approach would involve
    doing all or most of your credits in Greek and resolving each credit, directly
    or perhaps using other languages along the way, to Portugese. If I have translated
    the text correctly, and the film focuses on the fifth postulate, it might be fun
    to go from Greek to Portugese via the languages of prominent mathematicians who
    challenged the postulate. This kind of thing would be more work than static credits.
    \ However, this is, after all, a motion picture, in which type, if desired, gets
    to move."

    than Postulado. Perhaps others did not have the same difficulty, and it is possible

  body: "If that is for a poster, I think that this is an eyecatching, fun design.\r\n\r\nNot
    claiming to have any expertise in Brazillian Portugese, my sense is that a Brazillian
    will see Quinta rather than Quinto and Postulado rather than Postelado, but I'm
    a little less sure of the latter. Anyway, you are the expert on Brazillian clarity.\r\n\r\nIf
    my assumption that the film focuses on the fifth postulate is correct, the way
    that the two words are balanced is cool. I love the relationship between the Q
    amd P and the placement of the circle over the i.\r\n\r\nit strikes me as very
    Latin American, which I say as a compliment. \r\n\r\nIs the poster strictly type
    or is there also an image element?  This might have a bearing on the vertical
    spacing between the two words and their horizontal placement. \r\n\r\nI think
    that you can get this to the point where the producer wants to use it for the
    title on screen. \r\n\r\nThis is a big improvement on the original sketch. I'd
    love to see the final design.  \r\n\r\nVery curious to know what other people
    think and to see their suggestions. \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean you can't find Code
    46? Given where you are going, it is pretty much irrelevant, but even so, like
    several of Winterbottom's films, it is a cult film, and ought to be available
    at your local cult film video store :)"
