body: "Scriptorium Fonts is an Austin, Texas based type foundry founded in 1992 by
  game designer, editor, writer and historian Dave Nalle. It specializes in adaptations
  of antique fonts and fonts based on artistic hand lettering drawn from the work
  of famous artists and calligraphers like Alphons Mucha, William Morris, Willy Pogany,
  Arthur Rackham and Howard Pyle. \r\n\r\nTheir catalog currently includes over 600
  fonts and they have four type designers on staff: Dave Nalle, Michael Scarpitti,
  Peter Nevins and Kevin Andrew Murphy. Fonts include Abaddon, Hesperides, Buccaneer,
  Folkard, True Golden, Kelmscott, Ardenwood and Hendrix. They specialize in thematic
  packages of historic fonts based on specific artistic periods or design movements
  packaged together with licensed borders and art in the same style.\r\n\r\nIn 2003
  their fonts and clip art were used as part of a radical redesign of Whole Earth
  magazine under the guest editorship of Viridian guru Bruce Sterling. In 2005 they
  raised money for disaster relief after hurricane Katrina by donating the proceeds
  of the sales of three New Orleans themed fonts (Guede, Ironworks and Veve) to three
  different Louisiana charities. Recently their fonts have been prominently featured
  in the Spiderwick books and film, in several Tim Burton films, in the merchandising
  for the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films and in the World of Warcraft MMORPG.\r\n\r\nTheir
  site is at www.fontcraft.com"
