body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clip_6065.png]\r\nhi fellow typophiles!\r\nthis
  is my latest creation - a display typeface inspired by the shape of a paperclip,
  but not just another minimalistic modular angular kind of thing. i wanted it to
  have classic proportions and high contrast and - here's the twist - drawn only with
  one single line per glyph.\r\nit will have 3 weights, the heaviest is displayed
  on the picture. also lots of liga and dlig ligatures, and i'll try to make some
  starting and ending forms as well as some ornamental dropcaps, maybe...\r\n\r\nso,
  i would really appreciate your feedback. thanks! ondrej"

  body: "This is really great. I particularly like how you've made the inner counter
    of the o, e, g, 2 and 6 with a vertical bit of a paperclip. The top of the T feels
    too narrow, and that glyph is maybe too short, but maybe I'm imagining that. The
    c feels pretty thin on the bottom, although I don't know how you'd correct that.\r\n\r\nIf
    you feel like posting more characters, it would be interesting to see them.\r\n\r\nWhen
    does it go on sale? :) Let us know!"

  body: "Agreed, this is great stuff.\r\nI'd definitely raise the cap height.\r\nCan
    you \"cheat\" a little and take a tiny bit of weight off the lines where you have
    those barely overlapping loops at the tops of letters (e.g. /o/a/e/B/C/&/)\r\nLooking
    forward to seeing how you solve /i/X/#/$/!"

  body: "hi matt! thanks for your comments!\r\nyes, the caps are quite short. at first,
    the font was supposed to be caps only, so when i decided to add lowercase and
    did few letters, i found out that i really like how the short caps work with them.
    and what's a bonus \u2013\_i don't need to design small capitals :)\r\n\r\nright
    now i'm working on diacritics and the ligatures. i think it could be finished
    before christmas. i'll drop a line when it's out.\r\n\r\nthank you! ondrej"
