  I found.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated2.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAnd
  so far it's going better than I thought it would. This is a screengrab from illustrator:\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-P.gif\">\r\n\r\nLooking
  for advice on what I have so far, and on turning this \"P\" into an \"R\". Does
  anyone know of a typeface that's similar in form I could look at for reference?\r\n\r\nIf
  I get better at this I might try and go for a full typeface, rather than just a
  9-letter logo, but at the moment I'm not so sure...\r\n"

    thought of that kind of leg. Super helpful.\r\n\r\nI really like yours, and this
    is the one I just made before I saw your post... now I can't decide which style
    to go with...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-R1.gif\">"

    \"uphill\".\r\n\r\nThe first one has a certain oriental feel.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks hrant, it's definitely supposed to be going uphill (see original image
    above)\r\n\r\nI've been staring at it for so long, I was starting to get worried
    that it looked terrible and I just couldn't tell. Having another pair of eyes
    on it helps tremendously.\r\n\r\nI still love bojev's option and I'm torn, but
    I feel pretty confident to move on to the rest of the letters for now. I'll definitely
    post more when I have more."

  body: "bojev - I like that idea. Going to try it when I get the other letters done
    and see.\r\n\r\nquick update:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ridgeli-1_4404.gif]\r\n(final
    text will say Ridgelings)\r\n\r\nOnly 3 letters left to go! These will have thinner
    stripes in the hollow parts. Hoping I can get away with the cheap way I did it
    on the R.\r\n\r\nI was super worried about drawing on a curve, (instead of on
    a straight line and arc-ing the whole thing later) but I'm really pleased with
    how it's going!"
