body: "One of the unnoticed aspects of type is that regardless of size and internal
  proportions\u2014Cap height, x-height, and descender depth\u2014when characters
  of different fonts are set they share the same baseline. I know a bit of the history
  baseline standards. What I am curious about is what governs that standard in path
  defined digital type.\r\nI have noticed that when set solid most fonts behave as
  you would expect. However, some fonts seem to have had a \u201Csize\u201D standard
  imposed upon them that is incompatible with the actual size of the characters. Futura
  is a case in point. The image below was prepared in Adobe Illustrator CS. They fonts
  are Myriad, Futura, ITC Franklin Gothic, Kabel, and Gill Sans. All are Adobe Type
  1 format fonts and all were set 72/72. The horizontal lines indicate the baselines
  and the red circle the problem. What gives?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BaselineQuestion.jpg]"

  body: "In short your issue hear appears to be with the leadding of your type.  Leading
    is the distance between baselines. This term is orignated from the traditional
    form of typesetting where led stripps would be used to create distance between
    each block of type (Figure A). When each character is crafted it is placed inside
    a box that is refered to as the type block.  When the designer places the type
    in the box he uses a standard base line to determine where the text visually sits
    this is uniform through each type block, this line is known as the <b>baseline</b>.
    \ This box that they use to \"house\" the letter is refered to as having \"set-width\"
    and \"point size,\" being the width and height, respectively (Figure A).  The
    baseline in most typesetting programs will use the baseline to determine where
    to place the type respectively to the other characters. A 10 point font with a
    15 point ledding is going to be very loose and open when a 10 point font with
    a 10 point ledding will feel very tight. But all in all all type is different
    and it just needs to look right.\r\n<p></p>\r\nhttp://www.gcomollo.com/type/figure_a.jpg

  body: "Note that the linespacing is independent of the body size, i.e. the size
    of the actual glyphs. The type size in points always relates to the font UPM size,
    i.e. the standard design space in units. Most fonts have the design space (UPM
    size) of 1000 units. This means that when the type is set at 10 points, the 1000
    units of the font's design are 10 points large. In other words, at 10 points,
    each font unit is 0.01 points large. This means that if your uppercase H is 700
    units high, at 10 point, your uppercase H will be exactly 7 points high. This
    means that if you change the font UPM size from 1000 to 2000 without rescaling
    the glyphs, the letters at 10 point (or any other size) will shrink by half. \r\n\r\nThe
    linespacing is controlled by a number of different parameters in the font. They're
    discussed at http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=4356
    \r\n\r\nA."

    body: "Thanks. I read the article. I know that line space is distinct from body
      size\u2014I'm old enough to have been taught cold- and hot-metal composition
      where I manually adjusted linespace. I am also aware of UPM size and its calculation.
      What I cannot figure out here is why in unleaded setting, which is the way the
      font was originally created by the type designer(s), a font's descender would
      collide with an ascender on the next line, e.g. have a upm of more than 1,000
      in a 1,000 unit system.\r\nCan I assume that Futura has been incorrectly sized
      by Abobe or Lino (the sources in this case) or that changing operating systems
      have produced this anomoly?"

    the extenders longer?\r\n\r\nBTW, another font which is inadvisably large on the

    body: "Thanks. I'll check out Caecilia.\r\nI suspect that you are right about
      the big x-height. The settings I have seen of the font that were made from cold
      metal rather than Lino, Mono, photo, and digital all are visually smaller, but
      you can never determine if that was from the face on the body or through the
      addition of cast-on or laid in line space.\r\nTo some extent my question is
      rhetorical. The various images of the Futura plate proofs shown in Burke's <em>Paul
      Renner: The Art of Typography</em> indicate that all characters with descenders
      were designed with two lengths that I assume made the font conform with the
      German baseline standard (shorter descenders) and the Anglo-American baseline
      standard (longer descenders). If you rescale the longer descender \"American\"
      Futura based on the ascenders and descenders (rather than cap height and ascender),
      you end up with much smaller characters on the body and a x-height identical
      to Kabel. In other words, a font in proportion and size that is much more like
      old-style romans than sans serif grotesques.\r\nSo, I guess I am trying to figure
      out the source of the size change that produces the error shown in the initial
      image.\r\n\r\nI followed up on the measurements and came up with the following
      image showing Futura's dimensions. The second image is how the anomoly shows
      up in InDesign, The third image is a composite of all the patterns for lower-case
      p shown in Burke on page 93. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Futura body
