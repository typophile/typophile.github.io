body: Okay, so.. here is what I have so far. I'm still working out kinks on a few
  letters.. I'm still not sure of the width and angles of the A and the B. I'm also
  not sure if I should be varying the number of Q-tips more for line width(right now
  it's 4 for thick, 3 is the middle ground, and two is the thinnest).. Any suggestions
  are greatly appreciated!

    on typophile for a grade?\r\n\r\nAt least look at some historical material so
    that you can get the thicks and thins correct : )\r\n\r\nYou kids post and run...
    I have noticed this since you all signed on. What is the purpose of being a member
    here if all you are trying to do is... Hey Ms. Whoever, can you believe it. I
    had the intelligence to post to Typophile last night? Ain't I smart?\r\n\r\nAt
    least you are trying to do something with the info that is being thrown around
    in class. The rest of your buddies are just showing up for the grade.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    doing something creative with the info. Even if it is uninformed by your professors.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "It's interesting to see where you are going with this. You might consider
    bending or breaking some of the forms to get some more shapes. This could be used
    to make the letter forms more stadardized in width. The cross bar on the H as
    an example. If it bent in half downward the width of the character could be adjusted
    to be more in keeping with the rest of the characters. Right now it looks a little
    awkward. Good luck and have fun.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    cool. Downside, I don't think high res jpgs can be made into a keyable font. It
    would still be cool.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    a poster or something.
