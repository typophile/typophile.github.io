body: "hello,\r\n\r\nRight now I'm working on the symbol for a children's theater.
  It's a non-profit project, where children can take participate in the act, and learn
  how to deal with social problems. The client wanted to use the child in the logo
  (they have used clip-arty stick man in their old logo.) I tried to create a person
  of young age. he/she should be dynamic, friendly, soft and show the fun aspect of
  the theater. \r\n\r\nThe client has approved the shape, but now it needs tweaking
  and finetuning.\r\n\r\nI'm having problems getting the curves quite right - especially
  with the legs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your comments and help :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
  Greetings,\r\nle_samman"

  body: "in fact I came across cingular just today - maybe I had seen it long time
    ago and it influenced me subconciously. however, since cingular is in a completely
    different industry (and geographic) area, the similiarities doesn't bother me
    too much. Also, the symbol will be used fairly different in the corporate design
    process.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, for those who don't know cingular: <a href=\"http://www.cingular.com\">www.cingular.com</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
    further comments and help on the shape?"

    me, but that may be because I see the Cingular mark all over the place. \r\nJust
    stay away from orange."

    slide. If I were you I would consider the possible but unlikely scenario that
    if implemented your client might have to back out of this for legal reasons.\r\n\r\nAs
    they say, kill your darlings."

  body: "I think the geographic status of the logos is a separator here, I don't believe
    Cingular has a presence in Europe, and anyway that type of figure is hardly exclusive.\r\nAs
    for the figure the thickness of the limbs is too thin, the head is too tall for
    me I would look at a rounder shape for the head, especially for a child. Opening
    your pdf in Illustrator it looks as thought you have used more points than are
    necessary, by reducing them I think you can get smoother transitions.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thank you all for your responses. I see that the similarity has arisen -
    certainly not consciously. But I feel tim is right. cingular has no presence in
    central europe, and could hardly get in conflict with a non-profit children's
    theater organisation. That the shape isn't exclusive to cingular is another factor.
    however, I will anyways let the client know of this similarity at tomorrow's meeting.
    \r\n\r\nI have now refined the shape. I have deleted (hopefully all) unnecessary
    points. I have attached a pdf, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/styleguide_v.1.0.pdf\">styleguide_v.1.0.pdf</a>,
    where you can see how the logo will be used in the future - on page three and
    four you see that the little guy can also \"speak\" so to say. words, i.e. virtues
    like \"respect!\" or \"honesty!\" used in combination with the symbol to express
    different aspect of the theater.\r\n\r\nalso, I will be developing a colour palette
    - and in the future a few more poses which will serve to accommodate the brand
    architecture of the organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your comments! any
    feedback on the font? (it's \"ff info\" for your info..)\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\ns\r\n"

  body: "That font is a much better choice, however I would look at increasing the
    weight of your figure a touch so it has a bit more sympathy with the typeface,
    (you could hack it by adding a stroke to your original and increasing the weight
    to see if it works).\r\nTim"

  body: "I think you should use some other metaphor for representing 'people' for
    the people's theater. You just have the one little jumping/surprised figure. Perhaps
    you should show more than one than one figure (preferably with another design)
    to show a diverse group of \"PEOPLE\" that attends this theater. By just having
    one figure is contradiction\r\n\r\nBut if I do have to choose it will be... in
    bild-3 the very upper left design. I also like that red you chose.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope
    I'm helping,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "I think theres enough difference between your logo and the cingular logo
    to say that they're different, but the different colour does help. I think the
    wordmark works well. I like how you use the other words with the lil guy. Altough
    I agree with timid on the changes. \r\nI have nothing more to say about your work,
    just some ideas which I hope help in some way.\r\nI was thinking a rounder font
    so its a little bit more friendly, or even a like comic sans (LIKE I said) so
    it has a more childish feel. And I was thinking a blue, maybe skyblue for the
    colour. These are just some thigs that popped into my head when I saw it.\r\nHope
    I helped in saome way, and good luck.\r\n\r\n-ER"
