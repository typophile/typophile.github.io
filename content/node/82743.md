  proud to announce the unveiling of a new site dedicated to gathering information
  on writing systems - ScriptSource</strong>:\r\n\r\n\thttp://scriptsource.org\r\n\r\nScriptSource
  is a dynamic, collaborative reference to the writing systems of the world, with
  detailed information on scripts, characters, languages - and the remaining needs
  for supporting them in the computing realm. It currently contains only a skeleton
  of information, and so depends on your participation in order to grow and assist
  others.\r\n\r\nA major goal of ScriptSource is to enable the development of software
  that supports minority writing systems, including fonts, keyboards, sorting routines
  and typographic rendering systems. We hope that the site will draw together the
  design, computing and linguistic communities to meet these needs and increase global
  multilingual computing.\r\n\r\nScriptSource is currently sponsored, developed and
  maintained by SIL International (www.sil.org), a faith-based nonprofit organization
  committed to serving language communities worldwide as they build capacity for sustainable
  language development.\r\n"

  body: "hmmm, devolving into a code discussion. THIS, I know something about.\r\n\r\nH5
    <em>can</em> come after H2, but it <em>oughtn't</em>. HTML exists to semantically
    mark up your content so that different systems can properly interpret it. You
    are in effect saying:\r\n\r\n(here's my second-level heading) Our Promises (end
    of my second-level heading)\r\n(here's a paragraph) We have several promises for
    you. (end of the paragraph)\r\n(here's my fifth-level heading) Logic (end of my
    fifth-level heading)\r\n(here's a paragraph) We promise to be logical. We know
    that it's important that we make sense. (end of the paragraph)\r\n(here's my fifth-level
    heading) Clarity (end of my fifth-level heading)\r\n(here's a paragraph) We promise
    to be clear. We know that it's important that we communicate. (end of the paragraph)\r\n(here's
    my fifth-level heading) Professionalism (end of my fifth-level heading)\r\n(here's
    a paragraph) We promise to be professional. We know that we'll look silly if we
    don't. (end of the paragraph)\r\n\r\n\"But wait,\" I hear you exclaim. \"What
    marks up the beginning and end of a sentence?\"\r\n\r\nCapital letters and punctuation.\r\n\r\n\"What
    marks up words?\"\r\n\r\nSpaces.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope at least a little of that
    made sense."

  body: "I agree that h5 shouldn't come after h2, and it's been on the long list of
    bugs to fix. We can use a validator, too, and had a choice whether to produce
    perfect, clean code or to get this useful site into everyone's hands all that
    much sooner. Still, our browser testing shows only minor difficulties, primarily
    our tab handling on IE6. :-)\r\n\r\nWhat we'd really like is to have you play
    with the site and explore all that is within. If you're a type designer, do you
    think this will be useful to you? Let us know that you think are the most useful
    features, and what you'd like us to improve. What other information would you
    like to see on the site? What questions do you have? Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    hope that ScriptSource will become a gathering place of information for new Unicode
    proposals. For example, there will likely need to be some additions to the Tai
    Viet script block, and the many documents on the [[http://scriptsource.org/scr/Tavt|Tai
    Viet script pages]] will help a great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
