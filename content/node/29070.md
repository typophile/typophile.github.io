    \r\n\r\nThe problem is that even with all the ancient technology used for typesetting
    and printing there are hobyists or developing world print shops still using them
    - so they are not extinct. Or the technologies are so obscure that they were never
    really popular in the first place - so DOA not extinct. "

    FontFont has a good selection of distressed and broken fonts. Then there's <a
    href=http://www.exclamachine.com/>Sketchy Times</a> by Choz Cunningham.\r\n\r\nI
    assume you are just looking for a display face.\r\n\r\nBTW: a dodo is not an extinct
