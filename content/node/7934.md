body: I am looking for fonts to use in a packaging project for ethnic sauces. I am
  looking for something that represents Chinese food but not in the cliched way. I
  like the modern feel of these examples, can anyone identify them? <BR> <BR><img

  body: Yes. The first one is probably something customized too. <BR> <BR>Gizmo is
    very nice, but I am trying to use something more modern looking like the first
    example. <BR> <BR>Any guesses on the Sen logo?

  body: Cheryl, I don&#39;t know what that one is. But for some cool Japanese techno
    fonts, check out <a href="http://www.04.jp.org/">Yuji Oshimoto&#39;s Site</a>.
    He has a bunch there, as well as links to others. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

    <BR> <BR>One I really like is T-26&#39;s <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=200&amp;dw=873"
    target="_blank"> Fung Foo</a>. It&#39;s just on the brink of being corny.
