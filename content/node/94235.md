body: "Yesterday I introduced \"IndyFont\" to <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1028609?tstart=0\">the
  InDesign community</a>, there might be some interested parties over here as well,
  both in practical use as in technical details :-)\r\n\r\nIndyFont is a Javascript
  that runs under InDesign CS4 and newer, on both Mac OSX and Windows, and which converts
  vector art in an InDesign document to an OpenType font.\r\nThe prime target audience
  is Your Average InDesign User, desperately in need of a quick bullet, logo, or accented
  glyph. As such, operation has deliberatly been kept simple: run the script once,
  and it will create a template to draw your character(s) in. Run it again, and it
  will convert the artwork to a font, which you then can save in InDesign's own Fonts
  folder (enabling it only in ID itself), or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe free demo converts
  only one character; a full version is still somewhat of a Work in Progress, and
  will be a commercial product. The demo is downloadable from my site: <a href=\"http://www.jongware.com/binaries/indyfont_demo.zip\">indyfont_demo.zip</a>.
  Unpack, move to your Scripts folder, double-click in the Scripts panel to run.\r\n\r\nTechnical
  information:\r\nThe script scans [Black] colored vector art, merging separate objects
  where necessary, and converts the resulting paths to OpenType Type 1 Charstrings.
  These are then dumped to a file, including all of the necessary OTF scaffolding.\r\nThe
  script contains the full Adobe Glyph names set per 2007, with the exclusion of the
  quite useless hundred-or-so Box Drawing glyphs, and the <em>inclusion</em> of the
  strangely missing \"minussuperior\". The name \"Omega\" is in this system mapped
  to U+2126.\r\nUnicodes can also be assigned individually, and will then be validated
  against the set of 220 Unicode ranges per 14-Jun-2011 specs -- theoretically, it
  should be impossible to assign an invalid Unicode.\r\nThe given Font name is scanned
  for hints such as \"Bold\", \"Italic\", \"Condensed\", and \"Expanded\" (the full
  list of recognized font variants is longer), and usWeightClass, usWidthClass, as
  well as fsSelection/macStyle bits, are set to match. Thus, if you generate several
  fonts with the same base name but with different styles, software such as InDesign
  itself can sort the styles correctly.\r\n\r\nTwo fairly important things are missing:
  hinting (it's not too glaringly obvious for the occasional bullet or logo, but fonts
  intended for plain text suffer, of course), and kerning (the current input structure
  doesn't lend itself for easy input of kerning values)."

  body: "Native line art in InDesign is internally drawn as a subset of PostScript
    like commands (and thus translate *very* easy to PDF). Unfortunately, the Javascript
    interface translates it back into a dumb series of vertex points, including some
    pretty freaky conversion of perfectly okay Bezier curves to 'left, anchor, right'
    point sets. Those need to be converted <em>back</em> into proper Beziers, as the
    output format I'm using is Type 1.\r\nOn top of that, the internal vertices are
    all in full floating point format. Since most font rendering software is \"not
    there yet\", I round off the vertices to integer points.\r\nSo your delicate details
    may get lost in translation ...\r\n\r\nNevertheless: one of the nicer surprises
    is that Mac OS X is smart enough to allow real-time updating of fonts <em>even
    when you already used it</em>. That means you can preview your design in a live
    document! (One of the nastier surprises, on the other hand, was that Windows is
    not as forgiving and puts a File Lock on the font as soon as you use it anywhere,
    so you cannot overwrite or update it without quitting InDesign.)"

  body: "Thank you for that great review!\r\n\r\nYou can somewhat lessen the rounding
    effects you are seeing by enabling Document Grid (IndyFont already sets the grid
    at \"10 points with 10 subdivisions\" for that) and switching \"Snap To Document
    Grid On\".\r\n\r\nThe rounding effects are more visible when using Bezier control
    curves because each <em>end point</em> is rounded separately from its (presumably)
    mirrored counterpart. I did a brief experiment to see if it was possible to round
    one end, then extrapolate this adjusted direction to its counterpart and find
    the nearest integer values for that one. But that wasn't detectably better :(\r\n\r\nI
    think this could be why Adam is hesitant to allow fractional coordinates in FontLab
    by default. The end result <em>might</em> be slightly better for the tiniest of
    curves, but the font is not going to be compatible with \"older\" font engines
    (i.e., about anything on the market right now), and a straight conversion to integer
    points will reveal the same problems I got.\r\n\r\nBy the way, how did I ever
    come up with this idea? From reading Typophile of course!\r\nA funny story. I
    came across an older thread discussing Apple's Emoji font and I thought I might
    expand my own 'read_otf' software to see if it was possible to fish out interesting
    data from it. While rewriting, it occurred to me I knew a fair lot of the OpenType
    font format and it sounded like a fun project to try creating a font through ID.
    Well, (1) I found had to learn quite a bit more about OTF -- evidence is lingering
    in a couple of threads where I needed additional clarification --, and (2) I <em>still</em>
    haven't got round to examining Apple's Emoji font!\r\n(Hmmm ... creating an Opentype
    bitmap font, straight out of Photoshop -- possible?)"

    is worth something -- you'd always have access to CS6 versions, even when  'upgraded'
    (*) versions come out. Or that's what I remember from various confusing statements
    handed out in their forums.\r\n\r\nIf you want an overview of what the full version

    big interest in typography. I have done some testing with font editors, but for
    my usage these are mostly too expensive. IndyFont seems perfect though. I love
    the fact that additional OT features can be added this easily. Great work, I hope
    you keep expanding upon it and of course that it is a success for you.\r\n\r\nsome
    questions:\r\n\r\nI am curious to know if kerning might be a possibility in an
    updated version? As I would be creating mostly display fonts, primarily for my
    own use, I think optical kerning can be used, or I might use the kerning script
    by Peter Kehrel... What if I might want to use a font editor in the future to
    enhance these fonts (or ask someone else to do so)? Is it possible to create formats
    like UFO which can be further enhanced in font editors? \r\n\r\nAnother question
    would be if other opentype functions like discretionary ligatures or stylistic
    sets are, or will be possible to create with IF?"

  body: "Jeffrey, thanks! I think you fit *exactly* in our envisioned target audience
    :-)\r\n\r\nI have thought about kerning, but I cannot work out a good interface
    to add this to a font ... Currently, IF's Design Paradigm is \"one page, one glyph\"
    -- this sort of follows naturally from working through InDesign's interface. (But
    suggestions are welcome. I agree it would be a nice addition.)\r\n\r\nThe UFO
    format is only used by professional type designers. Theoretically I <em>could</em>
    add an export function specifically for this ... but that is veering outside the
    main purpose of the program. On the plus side, though, since the exported font
    is a regular OTF font, you should not have any problems opening and editing it
    with any existing font editor. (Of course, you'll have to keep in mind that any
    external edits will be lost if you re-create the font through InDesign.)\r\n\r\nThere
    are lots of OTF features that may be added. For this first version, we (I and
    Marc Autret, the programmer who re-wrote my demo into a full product) chose to
    add a couple of obvious eye-candy features first and see how that works out. There
    is a long list of other, more rarely used features that could be integrated with
    more-or-less the same code, and they may appear one at a time in various updates."

    export, and you have a new font.\r\n\r\nBut .. see David W. Goodrich's advice
    on <a href=\"http://indesignsecrets.com/topic/applying-diacritical-marks-for-transliteration-of-arabic-language\">InDesignSecrets</a>;
    with IndyFont you cannot <em>change</em> existing fonts, so you need to add your
    characters as a new one. That may mess up ID's native kerning. Another limitation
    is that you must select this new font for all individual characters (GREP Styles
    <em>may</em> work, but this depends enormously on your current style set-up).\r\n\r\nTry
    the free One-Character demo for your \"H-dot\" and see if it works for you."
