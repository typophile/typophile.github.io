body: "Anyone know what type face is used for Red Gold brand canned tomatoes? I'm
  thinking that the logo type is a custom, but maybe not. And  the serif used on the
  packaging, the word \"QUALITY\", would be really helpful if anyone can identify
  it. you can go to http://redgold.com/red_gold_company/index.asp or view the attached
  image, though its pretty small.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/redgold_5962.png]"
