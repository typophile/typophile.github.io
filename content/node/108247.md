body: "I'm looking for a Hebrew typeface to pair with Poetica. I know this may be
  hard since it's a chancery italic but I was hoping one of you guys may have an idea.
  Below is a sample for your reference. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adobe-2_4820.gif]\r\n\r\nSide
  discussion: Did anything ever happen with Eric Gill's Hebrew typeface? Has it been
  digitized? I read on a blog it has been but was unable to find a version of it. "

    a look at http://www.typophile.com/node/35367 if you must!\r\nAlso at David, http://typophile.com/node/90718
    especially the inclined forms.\r\n\r\nTo compound your problems,  Hebrew does
    not naturally incline to the right.\r\nModern Hebrew fonts that do incline to
    the right are offering almost a strong\r\nmaybe  aggressive 'in your face' kind
    of emphasis quite unlike traditional italian italics.\r\nMike\r\n\r\n(Stay away
    from Gill.  He did not understand Hebrew.)"
