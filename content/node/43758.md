body: "Another year has passed at Typophile, and as we are near our 8th year, we have
  completed another redesign. We moved away from the logo with the 7 animation (no
  one got it anyway). Also gone is the newsprint inspired design. The white on black
  text reflects the default state of the screen, where black is white. As we look
  toward the future and see that print is going the way of the dodo, we have redesigned
  our identity to include the futuristic electron blazing around the word mark in
  all of its probabilistic glory.\r\n\r\nIf you see any bugs, or would like to see
  the text larger, or if you would like to express your opinion in any way, please
  post your comments to this thread."

    few minutes where I thought \"O God, don't let this be for real.\" It was not
    helped by my having in the past frequented a forum which was designed in that
    very style, only perhaps worse. And no one there complained about the utter unusability
    of it as a forum! \r\n\r\nThis one was very well thought out, and hopefully some
    other forums will take the hint and change their designs."
