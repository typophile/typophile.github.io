  up the courage to post - I was about to say please be nice but actually at this
  point what I could probably use is vicious criticism :)\r\n\r\nI'm working on a
  project for uni to develop a concept for an iPhone app which explores the classic
  elements of typography that people sometimes find a bit dull to begin with - grids,
  letter spacing, hierarchy etc. I've been trying to come up with an approach that
  isn't necessarily a scored game but which can engage people repeatedly, over short
  spaces of time, in manipulating text using the physical controls of the iPhone (such
  as pinching to scale things, dragging to select and move type around). \r\n\r\nMy
  solution so far is to create an app which feeds in typography related articles from
  the internet and uses a simple interface to allow readers to edit the typography
  as they are reading, creating points of emphasis, altering the layout etc. Thus
  learning about how typography affects legibility in a very active and immediate
  manner. I've mocked up a basic overview of how it might work <a href=\"http://katesigrist.blogspot.com/2009/05/storyboard-screengrabs.html\">here</a>
  (the finished product will obviously be a lot more attractive! these were just sketches)
  and the full background to my project is <a href=\"http://katesigrist.blogspot.com\">here</a>
  - I was basically wondering if anyone had any thoughts on any of this at all? Comments,
  thoughts or criticism of any kind would be most gratefully received!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKate"

    think you have some good ideas for allowing fine typographic control over iphone
    content. Functionally, it isn't going to teach anyone anything about typography
    unless there's some kind of feedback or instructions to let someone know they've
    made a good decision. Typography education is mostly about teaching people how
    to see microscopic relationships between really small spaces. The iphone screen
    is way too coarse to show refined typographic detail, so you might want to focus
    less on emulating print typography and make it more about screen type. Speaking
    of which, your type is way too small for the iphone. "

  body: 'Thanks for the feedback! You''re right, the type gets very small at times,
    but in terms of creating a complete layout I couldn''t see how I could get around
    that. However, your point about focusing on screen type means that to a certain
    extent I may not need to anyway. Though there''s still the issue that one of the
    things I have to include is grids, so the type is by necessity going to get quite
    small when you view the whole thing at once. In terms of feedback, I was thinking
    of having a slider which lets you see when you''ve got a ''comfortable'' texture
    to the type - since this is something the program could actually work out based
    on space etc, whereas I''m not entirely sure about trusting an app to make judgements
    on aesthetics. '
