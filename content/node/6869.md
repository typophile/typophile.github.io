  body: The Brooklyn Dodgers logo is custom lettered, you won&#39;t  <BR>find anything
    like it as a digital font. However, I noticed the  <BR>T-shirt advertised on that
    same page uses <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/brush-script/brush-script/testdrive.html?s=Brooklyn&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Brush Script</a>. <BR> <BR>There are some scripts that have a
    swash like that, notably  <BR>Letterhead Fonts&#39; <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/ballpark.shtml"
    target="_blank"> Ballpark Script</a> <i>&#40;The Font Formerly Known  <BR>As Pilsner
    Script&#41;</i> and Nick Curtis&#39; free <a href="http://www.getfreefonts.com/fonts/431.html"

    this kind of thing, we get these questions so often.

  body: Mike I agree, one thing to put in the FAQ is &#34;Ask yourself when the sample
    was made&#34; When did the Dodgers move? late 50&#39;s?

  body: Good point, of course. Yeah, 1957 was their last season in Brooklyn &#40;same
    for N.Y. Giants&#41;. As a New Yorker until 1970, this would be sharp in my mind.
    <BR> <BR>Of course, that is assuming the Brooklyn lettering was truly authentic.
    Brush Script, mentioned by Yves for that one t-shirt, was  designed in 1942, so
    at least it&#39;s plausible as a model. I have a book showing Topps baseball cards
    back to 1951. The only wording I see on the baseball jerseys on the cards seems
    to be Dodgers, but the road jerseys might have said Brooklyn. &#40;I found a Dodgers
    web site describing the uniforms and between 1937 and 1957 the road uniforms said
    Brooklyn &#39;in the same script&#39; as the word Dodgers. Dodgers is NOT Brush
    Script. See this <a href="http://www.huntauctions.com/online/imageviewer.cfm?auction_num=19&amp;lot_num=867&amp;lot_qual=&amp;url_referer=view_lots_items_list.cfm"
    target="_blank">photo of Roy Campanella&#39;s jersey from 1954</a>. It seems likley
    that this lettering was drawn and traced, and cut out of fabric completely by
    hand.
