  booklet, different event. They want a similar look but want to use a different font.
  They liked the clean, classic yet edgy look. I hoping to find a font with similar
  characteristics. There is a lot of text and several tables so the slightly compressed
  character width was very helpful as well. Any suggestions? \r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help."

    has bit of that."

    body: Thanks for the reply. The words of my client in defining edgy were, "It
      looks traditional and modern at the same time, legible and clean."
