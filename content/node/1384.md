body: Okay, so most of you professional types already know about this site, but for
  those of us who might not...check out <a href="http://www.crank.com" target="_blank">www.crank.com</a>.
  Almost all my graphic/web design is for non-profs for free and most of them are
  for kids. Crank has some really fun/wacky fonts. I know they aren&#39;t up to Adobe
  standard but in the right situation can be just the right thing. I&#39;m going to
  purchase several for a website I&#39;m currently designing. So if you&#39;re looking
  for something really off the beaten type path, check this site out. As a hockey
  mom, I think the Candian fonts really got to me! They actually have some fairly
  decent fonts as well. Enjoy! &#40;Some of the type descriptions are worth visiting
  on their own&#41;

  body: I guess even us old codgers can learn something new everyday! I guess it&#39;s
    a blessing to know that even with very little sleep and kids the brain still works
    enough to laugh at your mistakes. Didn&#39;t even know it was there, let alone
    what it was for.

    fonts there.
