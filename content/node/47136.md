  body: As stated on Logopond, I think the suggestions for trying a geometric sans
    are a direction you should aim for.

  body: 'I agree with the above - a geometric sans serif might work better. Light
    to medium weight. I would work more on the camel shape, and its relationship with
    the type. right now it looks too plain/common. i hope this helps. Good luck. '

  body: The camel is geometric so are the geometric sans typeface to go with it. Try
    using geometric sans in various samples, then you will find a combination that
    will please yourself. The one you like most may be the one . Cheers !

  body: You cannot put all Caps together so tightly and achieve the same effect of
    two words with tight kerning as in the last example. You do not need to use a
    geometric sans with a geometric mark, use the factor of juxtaposition to help
    the elements of type and the graphic elements to complement each other... trust
    me. Do not use the gradient version of the camel, use the version in the first
    examples that you gave us. By the way, great graphic mark... good job.

  body: "It seems you already know the answer you want to hear. Why bother asking?\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'd set it in a light <cite>geometric sans,</cite> all caps, without the tight
    kerning. Something like Futura Light, Kabel Light, Gotham Light, or Proxima Nova
    Light - with a nice round 'O' and 'G'. But, since you obviously want a tightly
    kerned serif typeface, go with what you've got. It's not terrible, but it's not
    great.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think the problem with the serif font is that it is too weak. I mean, you
    need contrast to make it work. So you have a symbol that is very geometric, sharp
    angels and straight lines. So you either need something that mimics that style
    or something that complements it. Just a regular everyday serif font isn't going
    to serve this symbol well. It needs a strong type to mirror it's strong build.\r\n\r\ncourtney"
