body: There seems to be a recent trend of partially squared Sans faces. There is Thirstype&#39;s
  <a href="http://thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=ApexSans" target="_blank">Apex Sans</a>,
  Christian Schwartz&#39;s <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=SIMIAN-FO&amp;sub=view"
  target="_blank">Simian</a> from House Industries, and the new <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html"
  target="_blank">Klavika</a> by Eric Olson from his Process Type Foundry. Also here
  in the critique section, we have <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?29/50157"
  target="_blank">Tramway</a>, being developed by Hanno Bennert. <BR> <BR>There are
  probably a lot of others I haven&#39;t mentioned. What do you all think of this
  trend? How do you compare the different fonts in this category? <BR> <BR>I think
  Simian, which is wide, is very stylishly done. Klavika is striking because it brings
  some warmth to this style, and seems exceptionally readable for a sans.

  body: Personally I find them to fill a gap in the classification of sans serif typefaces.
    Somewhere in between Geometric and beyond Humanist. <BR> <BR>There is also Font
    Bureau&#39;s Stainless and Amplitude.

    <BR> <BR>I agree with William: the best examples of this genre bring a bit of
    humanity &#40;in the form of subtle modulation and ornament&#41; to the table.'

  body: 'Interesting topic. Ties in to the rigidity angle of the Legato discussion.
    <BR> <BR>I think it might be a reaction against the cloying mushiness of humanism
    in type design, without falling for the &#34;Forest Gump&#34; grot style, or the
    &#34;Dumb and Dumber&#34; vernacular. And it might reflect what some designers
    desire in this century: honesty, firmness, bravery, moderation, compassion. <BR>

    something that this give the sans more punch without the problems of circular
    bowls on the geometric faces, and keeping the more readable, narrower proportions
    of the humanist faces.  <BR> <BR>&#39;Cloying mushiness&#39; I think goes too
    far.'

    which Zapf used in the design of Melior. <BR> <BR>I think the name was coined

  body: Galaxie Polaris, Amplitude and Melior are more rounded than what I was thinking
    of. It&#39;s the more angular thing that seems to be popular right now. As Yves
    says, it suddenly seems like a good idea to a number of people.  <BR> <BR>It is
    interesting that Zapf says he designed Melior without knowing about the superellipse
    as a mathematical construct. He just was figuring how to increase counter space
    for a newspaper type, and drew it exactly. Then Piet Hein, I think, pointed out
    that it was the superellipse.  <BR> <BR>The rounding on Melior is softer than
    Apex etc. I don&#39;t know why, because I am otherwise a big fan of Zapf, but
    I&#39;ve never liked the look of Melior.

    <BR>Any one knows ? <BR> <BR>AS <BR> <BR> <BR>PS/ <BR>Time ago I cached on mi
    Mac this text. <BR>Cannot find the source though. <BR> <BR>&#34;The origin of
    the &#34;Super Ellipse&#34; has an historical curiosity.  <BR>Piet Heine, was
    a Dutch architect, poet and acknowledged <BR>creative genius. &#40;Somna, Hex,
    Super-ellipse, Super-egg, <BR>&#34;Grooks&#34;, etc.&#41;  <BR>Well, regarding
    the super-ellipse, here is the story. <BR>In 1959 Piet Heine the architect was
    approached by the Stockholm <BR>city planners to solve a difficult problem in
    urban planning. <BR>This was the first time Heine ever focused on the subject
    of <BR>ellipses. The city square, with all the streets leading into it, <BR>needed
    a fresh approach, a pleasing architectural shape to create <BR>a focal point for
    the town. None of the city planners were able <BR>to solve the problem. The square
    didn&#39;t work, the ellipse didn&#39;t <BR>work and the &#34;segmented ellipse&#34;
    didn&#39;t work. Indeed, it was a <BR>devious puzzle.  <BR>Enter Piet Heine ...
    Voila! ... and the super-ellipse was born!  <BR>The curious thing about this story
    is that Hermann Zapf had used <BR>a &#34;super-ellipse&#34; like shape in the
    design of his typeface called, <BR>&#34;Melior&#34;, which was designed in 1949
    and commercially released in <BR>1952. Now, that is 7-10 years earlier then the
    &#34;super-elllipse&#34; <BR>was invented!&#34;
