body: "Hello Everybody, I was hoping to get some help and maybe get pointed in some
  good directions as I start applying for internships for the summer. I'm currently
  a Junior at Iowa State University for Graphic Design and I've spent a large amount
  of my time researching and applying for internships at a variety of firms. However,
  considering my passion for typography and my interest in type design I'm keeping
  an eye out for any internship openings at type foundries in the US. I know some
  of the larger ones and have either made contact with (or am in the process of contacting):
  Hoefler & Frere-Jones, House Industries, Emigre, T.26, and The Chank Company. \r\n\r\nI
  would be really excited to have the opportunity to intern at a type foundry in the
  summer and so I'm wondering if anyone has any names of foundries I should consider
  or any advice as I continue with my applications. My portfolio is largely graphic
  design work, but typography plays such a major role in my process for problem-solving
  and I've undergone my own projects and opportunities to learn more about the art
  of type design. You can visit my portfolio here: [[http://www.brandonalvarado.com|brandonalvarado.com]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all the help everyone. "
