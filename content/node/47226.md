  there a way, or a version of ClownLab that DOES NOT remove overlap automatically,
  spoiling the action set's intent.\r\n\r\nThis letter, e.g. should remain a single

    I revive my older request that you adopt FOG's bolding method which gives much
    better results, both for <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/stuff/KLTF_boldcomparison2_FLS-10_FOG-20.jpeg\"
    target=\"_blank\">negative bolding</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/stuff/KLTF_boldcomparison1_FLS20_FOG40.jpg\"

    don't object to this recommendation, the RMX Tools won't do auto-(negative)bolding
    on a single master basis.\r\n\r\nHowever, I know that J\xE9r\xE9mie Hornus has
    developed an FL macro that does exactly what you ask for: autobolding just like
    FL (i.e. contour offset) but without remove overlap.\r\n\r\nI will contact him
    and let you know whether he is prepared to share it."

  body: "I just remembered a workaround I once did:\r\n\r\nFirst, do the autobold
    effect to a lesser extent that you want. For example, give the parameters for
    weight in(de-)crease half the value.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this retains the node structure
    because no overlaps occur.\r\n\r\nThen, use MM-extrapolation to double the effect.
    You would generate an instance at -1000 or at 2000, depending on your setup. This
    should lead to exactly the same result you initially wanted, but without removed
    overlaps.\r\n\r\nIf halving the values is not sufficient (because it still creates
    and removes overlaps), try a third, or a quarter, amplifying the effect accordingly
    in the end. The more extreme your amplification the more rounding errors might
    come into play, however.\r\nNote that when extrapolating you should always try
    to work with full numbers (i.e. thousands) because then at least this step is
    lossless."

    weight\" feature (in FontLab Studio 6 there will be a better algorithm that we've
    taken from Fontographer), you should ADD weight using FontLab's Bold feature,
    and then make an MM font out of your regular and bold (with a weight axis), and
    then generate an instance that would be an extrapolation \"to the left\", e.g.
    with -100 or -300 or whatever. Then the unwanted problems will not occur. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Adam, that is not what I was proposing but it is quite similar.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I suggested to remove the weight to a lesser degree (say, \u20135 instead of \u201310)
    in order to avoid overlaps and then <cite>amplify</cite> the effect, you would
    do the effect in the opposite direction and then <cite>reverse</cite> it. Both
    using MM-extrapolation.\r\n\r\nHard to say which method gives better results since
    increasing the weight can easily produce overlaps as well. I guess it depends
    on design and the individual letter: the risk of overlaps through producing overly
    thin \"negative weight\" strokes vs. ending up with overly tight overlapping counters.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    this whole mess could easily avoided if the internal overlap removal was simply
    switched off. People can apply it in a subsequent step if they want to so I wouldn't
    even keep it as an option."

    contour structure, so that interpolation is possible. It only works with TrueType
    curves since it was easier for me to write the code and fonts we produce are often
    OpenType TTF; but it should not be very difficult to make it work on PS contours
    as well.\r\n\r\nI think we can wait quite a long time before the release of FL
    6... so it was not a waste of time to make such a script.\r\nStill, it is a work
    in progress and only used internally.\r\n\r\nBTW, I was kind of looking for a
