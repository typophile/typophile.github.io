body: This is font in the Softmaker Megafont package.  The Front Page family is cloned/forged
  from Frutiger.  But I can't find a Small-Cap variant of Frutiger. So where did Front
  Page Small Caps originate?

    concerned with fine details doing small caps for the entire Frutiger family could
    be done in an hour or two."
