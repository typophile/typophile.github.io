body: "So today I received an email from MyFonts about a problem with my recent font
  release - Origins. Apparently a customer reported a problem - all of the lowercase
  letters in this font were showing up as alternates in the Font Book preview and
  the customer thought there was a general problem with the font because of this preview
  issue. (There isn't, just for the record, I and several others have tested it in
  different applications, but I can certainly see how someone else off hand might
  get this impression after installing it in Font Book and seeing that sort of preview.)
  \r\n\r\nConfused and somewhat horrified, I launched Font Book and installed Origins
  (I usually use Suitcase Fusion for my font management, not Font Book) and lo and
  behold... all of the contextual alternates I had programmed into it were showing
  up instead of the standard lowercase letters. I asked a fellow designer and he said,
  \"oh yeah, Font Book does that will all fonts that have contextual alternates\"
  and sure enough, when I looked through my list of fonts - other designer's fonts,
  not my own - every font that has a set of contextual alternates previews that way
  in Font Book.\r\n\r\nI did go back and took out everything in contextual alternates
  and made it into a stylistic set instead, however I'd really like to be able to
  use this opentype feature - but not if there are going to be complaints and/or misunderstandings
  because of a Font Book issue. \r\n\r\nSo what the heck do I do about this?! I performed
  some research online about this issue, and even went to the Mac store to ask about
  this, and didn't find anything. Is there a way to fix this when I generate the fonts
  from FontLab so it shows up correctly in Font Book's preview?\r\n\r\nAny advice/wisdom/HELP
  that any of you awesome Typophiles could provide me with would be very much appreciated.
  Thanks!!!"

  body: "I cannot offer you specific advise regarding potential font problems per
    se, nevertheless, back in the day, when I was still using apple's Font Book, I
    remember that it's previews got really strange at times, and that was due to that
    fact that the primary system language was not standard English (setting it to
    Czech made Font Book previews display some Polish caracters\u2026 go figure\u2026).
    \r\n\r\nSo perhaps you investigation should begin with the \"International\" (\"Language
    & Text\" on Snow Leopard) settings on the Mac, and verify the system's primary
    language is English. Also, if you are not using Apple's latest OS (which is 10.6.3
    at this time), try and see if you can replicate the problem on a machine that
    has this latest version installed. I know that Apple had tweaked and improved
    the Font Book application for their latest OS release (they had also made changes
    to the way the system handles fonts), even though it remains a rudimentary application
    at best.\r\n\r\nI hope this information might help."

  body: "Thanks Adam! Unfortunately that didn't work, Font Book is still previewing
    with contextual alternates. I do have the latest OS installed... I have a feeling
    that this sort of thing is a fluke and not something that I personally can prevent
    from happening on others systems. Just troublesome getting your first customer
    complaint. :(\r\n\r\nOk, I'll stop whining now, thanks!!!\r\n\r\n~ Laura"
