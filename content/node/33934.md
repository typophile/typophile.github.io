    target=\"new\">Stymie Bold Italic (oblique)</a>.\r\n\r\nOdd, we never see the
    obliques much anymore. After Lubalin Graph, Stymie sort of fell by the wayside."

  body: "Actually I think it might be Stymie Extrabold Italic, based on the foot serif
    of the K. The italic has a half serif in that weight. The other weights have a
    full serif on the leg, as do all the Romans. This is shown in Mac McGrew's book
    on American Metal Typefaces. The oblique would just be a slanted Roman.\r\n\r\n-
