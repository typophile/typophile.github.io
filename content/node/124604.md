  body: "Agree with Bob that this is custom, but you could easily adapt something
    like Ela Demiserif to match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/ela-demiserif/\r\n\r\nhorizontally
    widen and vertically compress everything, rotate the |O|, delete the crossbar
    on the |A|, and add the \u201Cfoot\u201D to the |M| |N|, and |A|."

  body: As Kevin points out many custom logos start out as some font but are customized
