BTW Jackie, I noticed you're in LA, so I'd like to bring to your attention a typeface design evening course on offer at ArtCenter (Pasadena), which I've run twice in the past, and will be offered again in the Spring. I also noticed you really like fat, high-contrast fonts. :-)  So maybe you can make your own super fat, super elegant typeface!

There is no difference. It is a continuum Hrant. When will you understand that?

If you are going to offer this course then you have to come at it from an unbiased position, otherwise you are doing your students a disservice.

Not humanly possible.

Which is not at all to say that I think "continuum" -in the strict, and
useful, sense of the word- is a valid idea here. I discover, contemplate,
and try to teach about <em>differences</em>, which is what makes life worth living.

And FYI, the main feedback I've gotten from my students is "wow, I had
no idea type design is so complex!" This is exactly what I love to hear,
something I would not hear if I simply told them how to make type the
way I like to make it. I'm not a monkey trainer, I'm a... scary gate opener.

The fact that you cannot view the continuum as valid proves my point. The pen, in all it manifestations, is the source of letters. Because you have some aversion to the pen, brush and chisel says more about your inability to fit in. That is fine. Go off and do your little thing! Impress us all with your genius. Is it here yet or do we have to wait decades?

As to the feedback, that and 3 bucks will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks, been there done that.

That's like saying the source of music is the (insert whichever musical instrument came first). The source of anything 'creative' is surely the mind: we're just imitating God (made in his image). The tool that was first used to produce it is merely coincidental. It doesn't have to inform how things are now best done, or how they will be done better tomorrow using different tools. I guess someone wrote with his/her finger in the dust of the ground prior to any pen being made. According to your logic, it could be argued that the source of letters is some Neanderthal's hand with or without a rock in it. 

If I have understood you correctly, I think you would also say that the 'source' of domestic lighting is fire. However, today's best and brightest lights today have nothing to do with fire. Hrant may or may not be the Thomas Edison of typography (only time will tell - it's said that it took Edison more than a thousand attempts before he got a bulb that worked). I admire Hrant for wanting to break new ground, that takes character and resolve, it's what enterprise is all about. I would be very wary of being the person who witnessed Edison's penultimate light bulb experiment and branded him a complete waste of time and space.

I'm not sure why you push your pen argument so aggressively. Does it matter that much where letters came from? If so, why, please help me understand? Have you ever thought, even for a moment, there may be better ways of making letters than with your pens?

Hrant, please show us what you've got so far. I and probably more than a few other are  intrigued.

Nick
Sorry if you mistake my passion for aggression. I earn my living with pens, brushes etc. as well as FontLab and Fontographer. Don't ever see separating myself from our calligraphic heritage. Variety is the spice of life.

Sorry Hrant. Yep, I started it, but the fact that you referred to me as "your ilk" shows that you are not as accepting as you want everybody else to be.

Mostly what I've had worth sharing so far are ideas.
Some day it will click for me, and then watch out.

But for those who need to see actual examples, <em>we</em> do have something so far: Legato. Chirofanatics like Michael (they are legion) need to study it and understand why it's so special, and why that casts doubt on their regressive, self-validating ideology.

Chris: I love your peaceable approach but who decides what are 'valuable ends'? In my opinion some very bad men have fully justified their ends as valuable 'within themselves' and been objectively very WRONG.

That said, Hrant may turn out to be justified that what he is concerned with is very valuable, indeed more valuable than supposedly informative handwritten forms; who is to say what people will say of him in 500 years' time and good luck to him? 

I admire anyone who can draw a beautiful form with a pen. I admire Hrant because of his enterprise and boundary-pushing. If Thomas Edison walked into a bar, most of us would want to buy him a drink. Even if Hrant never has a breakthrough like that, one can't criticise him for his ennui with the pen. The guy is restless, eager to innovate and just got bored with it all, that's all. OK so maybe he's a little churlish to keep saying, "Michael, I'm bored with the very thing that you cherish."

Most of all me.  :-/
It's not that I'm closed to new ideas, it's that I've thought about this topic -and sparred about it with the best- for years. In me, the illogic of chirography has overpowered its carnal appeal.

The folks who use the type that is generated from the work decide and some may decide badly in our eyes. As is usual with human endeavor, there are many failures for every success. Hrant can find no logic in a calligraphic tooled basis so he need not waste his time bothering with it. Perhaps Michael sees it the opposite way so he will continue to work as he chooses. Luckily, we are dealing with type here and not nuclear weapons so there is no great threat to humanity either way. We need not agree on how we work or on what is a good outcome. Humans have argued for centuries. When all the dust has cleared, we can have our passions, our beliefs, and our opinions. We don't get to judge our own work anyway. We just put it out for others to use.

Nor am I to old : ) That, hopefully, will get a giggle.

I don't know that I particularly appreciate the the revival of archaic forms. Take for example the proliferation of Uncial forms. (I am so tired of calligraphic forms that are regurgitated without  an eye on contemporary design.) Most, to me, seem like wasted effort. I haven't seen a good one, Uncial, in decades. I love Lange's Solemnis, but it was a hybrid, a contemporary adaptation. Whether it is "chirographic (calligraphic, pretty please Hrant, just for me)" or not, it was cutting edge way back when. Sort of what you are alluding to, not quite, but the same spirit.

If you read between the lines above Hrant you will see you and I are not so different. O hell... you don't even have to read between the lines.

Chirography is what's archaic.

> But still you see inside these ephemere bones of a pen.

Too often people see what they want to see. Even in Legato, a font
designed by a devoted anti-chirographer, some people see the pen.
The illusion is a succubus, and some of you remain under her spell.

Well, how about that?
Hogwash, well I never would have guessed it. Many thanks for the enlightenment, I have always thought that our alphabet evolved through handwriting. I stand corrected, thank you.
However I am perplexed to understand how this new alphabet will be constructed and what it will look like? Will I be able to read it?
It will be hard to learn to read and understand at first, but I am willing to try, so lets see these new letter forms that are not written and have no heritage to the pen or its manifestations.
I suppose that Adobe will be dropping it's pen tool as well? 
Hrant, Nick, what new tools are you guys using to replace pens, pencils & their electronic equivalents?
Also what are you replacing the current latin lettering system with?
I really want to know as I am trying hard to understand your ideas and theory that as yet seems impossible for me to visualize. An example will help greatly because I can't visualize ABC..abc... etc that do not pay homage to the pen. The pen may not be the starting point for todays young type designers, but the letters they are making leave no doubt as to the pens heritage, no matter how much they hate the idea.
Enough talk, lets see these ideas and theories in practice.</div>

> Hrant, Nick, what new tools are you guys using to replace pens, pencils & their electronic equivalents?

Tools are and always have been improving all the time. It's interesting that you see a computer as an equivalent to the pen. I'm not even sure when a pen became a pen and stopped being a stick.

First, maybe I'm being naive when I say this but, the fact that certain letters are certain shapes is, for me at least, nothing more than an 'accident'. You can see this by the way two (phonetic) written languages with similar sounds may have completely unrelated shapes to describe them, e.g. Hebrew and Latin.

Next, I think therefore that the skeleton of an individual letter (I'm not talking about stress or serifs or angularity or anything else) is arbitrary; that is to say, it ought not to make a difference if it had been initially described with a stick, with a pen or with another (equally) effective method of leaving a mark on another material.

It logically does not follow to say that the best method of designing a character must be driven by what someone's pen (or stick) did hundreds and thousands of years ago on a sheet of wax/papyrus/paper/a tree/a cave wall or whatever. That would be like saying to an aeroplane designer, don't forget that one of the first methods of crossing a large expanse of water involved carving out the trunk of a non-porous tree (forgive me if my nautical history is hazy). Technology is continually evolving. Don't try to tell me that Boeing think that several logs tied together with twine is even remotely useful when designing the next generation of hyper-efficient airliner.

An A is A-shaped. That the 'pen' was responsible for the skeletal shape itself is like attributing the <em>content</em> of this post to the 'personal computer'. On one level, of course, it's perfectly true but not very meaningful.

So answer me this, which came first; writing or the pen?

Hrant, don't go! Surely not even you are saying that an A can be a different shape from an A. That's what an A is!</div>

> the skeleton of an individual letter ... is arbitrary

In fact, there is no skeleton! The reason for this is simple: when it comes to the <em>purpose</em> of type (not necesarily the same thing as why a given person makes type), which is to be read, we don't read the black bodies, we read the contrast between black and white. A tool that marks the black imposes a dysfunctional design constraint: a relationship between the two sides of the black; the relationship should be only between the black and the white - we must design the border, not the body. This is true even if one is "minding the white" when making the black; the pointless constraint remains, no matter how hard we try. In the worst case -like a font made directly from calligraphy- it becomes a master-slave situation; in the best case it's still an unequal marriage, thus non-ideal.

The shedding of the illusional "skeleton" concept is the key that lets type be more than merely where it came from - which btw is not just the pen, but a host of other marking methods, some much older than the pen. The pen is simply what has come to look prettiest to the greatest number of people, becoming crushingly mainstream, and thus elevated to a mythical stature, holding us back. We are worshiping a corpse.

Somebody who refuses to see this (which is not the same thing as making non-chirographic fonts - I myself am still stuck on the black!) is generally simply afraid of what it implies about his body of work, or maybe of what it implies about his adored teachers.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, are you seriously suggesting that the traditional, received form of, for example, a letter A, is based on the remainder of the white space once it's been 'adulterated' by black? I always thought it was to do with 3 straight lines, to a greater or lesser degree. (I am open to being persuaded otherwise, by the way.) I'm not sure I warm to my methods of construction (whether or not they were influenced by the pen) being described as illusional (delusional?) but I do like your willingness to get out of the box that you perceive and to challenge the way people think if you sincerely think they've been hoodwinked, as long as it's not because you just don't like people, which is how it sometimes comes across to me at least.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I certainly agree that the "A" is received, perceived and generally rendered as being made of three lines. What I'm saying is that that's not how it's <em>used</em> by readers - reading -not creating- being the purpose. As a result, ideal type design does not see an "A" as being made of three lines (or any other fattened skeleton); it sees an "A" purely as a certain relationship of black and white, unfettered by an illusional metaphoric tool. Arguably punchcutters were doing this -to some extent, in practice- from day one, but designers who drew/painted shapes and then asked punchcutters to make them were generally throwing things off.

One can't help but think of the shape the ink makes before the space that it leaves (probably depends on the individual philosophy of the punchcutter him/herself). 

Thinking about space as well as ink is the area of typeface design that is alien to me. Am I normal or does everyone think in equal measure about black and white? I know from my own experience (such as it is) that the black gets a whole lot more airtime than the white. Is there any mileage in designing a complete font without any black infilling so that the black and white are both white and therefore, in theory at least, get equal airtime during the design process?

		<div class="commentbody">It is indeed very difficult to see the black-white instead of just the black (or just the white). I know because I haven't managed it yet! In fact it scares me so much that I haven't tried hard enough yet. There might even be some human biological impediment that prevents it! The key might be a method that leads to abstraction, for example how in Legato Bloemsma conceptualized that "twisting" the inside whites would break the black's strangle-hold across letters, thus allowing glyphs to meld into words (actually, boumas) better. And this leads to a paradox inherent to type design*: when you consider that a font isn't the end-result, a font is a tool that leads to an end-result, you realize that no matter what ideology you use to make a font you <em>never</em> really see it anyway: you see individual glyphs, and sets of glyphs, but you can't see what it really is at once, or even what a font's user will end up setting (and then his reader seeing).

* Which is absent in calligraphy and lettering.

So designing a font is an act of abstraction anyway. Not being able to see the black-white directly does not preclude approaching a certain fruitful ideal; an ideal that cannot be approached via black-centric design.

Do you mean an outline font? In terms of reading that wouldn't work. But tellingly that's how we design fonts (at least mechanically) - we edit lines that separate black and white. Many chirographers think outline editing is a curse, and some of them (like G Noordzij, IIRC) have even tried to invent black-marking font editing systems. To me outline editing is a blessing, allowing for the final liberation of type, by helping us get over the black.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant,

I have read many of your posts about this topic before and usually I am quite the lurker but I thought to leave my two cents this time. I believe your characterization of calligraphy/writing based type design is overly simplified. As a note I honestly do think your continued arguments in favour of Bloemsma's typefaces and his approach are refreshing and will definitely prove quite fruitful. You speak of a different construction methodology that certainly deserves much study, but the array of letter constructions all take from the archetypal letter shapes but not necessarily the same proportions or weight/axis tendencies. But I don't think writing based techniques and the idea of black and white relationships is mutually exclusive as you make it out to be. 

I should point out that I am still in the very early stages of approaching type design and I decided to start in a way that made sense to me, which is to look at very traditional methodologies and past type design techniques. I believe that history informs much of my work as a graphic designer so I have felt it important to look at writing and the origins of writing (and writing tools) before looking at ways to break from those tools, or elements that can deviate from them. 

But back to why I think your argument against writing models is overly simplified: calling writing based type design black-centric really does the methodology and practitioners a disservice, and this is mostly because what calligraphy/writing allows is a look at rhythm/spacing/texture and not merely the application of a black to a white surface. I believe that letterforms are important but they are not designed in isolated conditions, it is really the relationship between the letters that is paramount, and therefore the white space is an element that is enormously important in writing based designs. Writing is important as a way to study these black and white shapes and the many permutations that can come from a few simple tools. On a whole I think I believe I give the same amount of emphasis to the shapes of the white spaces (counters and the space between letters) and the black of the letter, but this is an obvious relation, because when you change one, you change the other. Writing based type design is not just tracing over some scans with beziers, I see type as a system of letters that translates into a groupings of letters (words) that form whole fields of texts (and this 'macro' arena is where a study of rhythm and texture is very important). 

Above I have termed writing/calligraphy based type design as a methodology and it as a methodology/approach it should be able to exist alongside many other methodologies for type design and lettering. I just wanted to say that the issue may not be as 'black and white' as you make it out to be.</div>

I just can't see how.
I might be missing something - I just don't know what it might be.
Sometimes I can tell I'm missing something; here it just feels very solid.

But I do agree that it's not so clear cut; I talk of pure extremes which I know don't exist - what we make is always somewhere between extremes. Talking of the extremes is simply useful to abstract well about a topic.

For example, there's no such thing as pure reading. Any act of reading involves some attention spent merely gazing at the beauty of a page or even a single glyph. And I'm the first to admit that calligraphy is beautiful. One of the few fonts I've ever purchased is Ex Ponto. Mostly I'm interested in revealing the failings of something that's too often given mythical relevance; it's the grasping of failings that help us improve, help us right the balance. It's been four years since Legato, but we still haven't made anything like it. The balance is manifestly off.

In any case I am warmly grateful for any challenges to my ideas. Refuting them isn't the way forward, assimilating them into a larger view is the only way for me to grow. I argue not to overpower, but to catalyze.

Hogwash

" Many chirographers think outline editing is a curse,"

I assume by chirographers you mean or include calligraphers, perhaps a few ignorant souls, but again: hogwash.

Thanks, Nick for your explanation as it reinforces what I was reading between the angst against the pen. As Michael tried to explain, calligraphy and contemporary calligraphy in particular have more in common with hrants ideas then he realises.
The major difference between us and hrant's 'ideal' is that we have not abandoned the pen, nor history as irrelevant. We also realise that rather than place restrictions to invention and creativity craft knowledge opens the doors to endless possibilities. We have also been playing with drawing outlines and counter spaces for centuries, this idea is not new or revolutionary.

I believe that hrant's 'ideal' is misconceived and is the one that is extremely limiting and restricting:
"So designing a font is an act of abstraction anyway. Not being able to see the black-white directly does not preclude approaching a certain fruitful ideal; an ideal that cannot be approached via black-centric design."

I agree with hrant when he says that designing a font is an act of abstraction. All lettering, no matter how it is made is a form of abstraction, or more correctly semi-abstraction as pure abstraction is non representational and therefore would leave no recognized glyph or letters and therefore completely defeat the purpose.
You do not have to denounce and abandon the pen or the 'skeleton' to draw outlines or achieve what hrant is trying to articulate.
The pen and the skeleton are restrictive only when married with a lack of understanding of the craft.

One last point that I know really raises the hackles of more than a few calligraphers; the very term chirography is an insult and a known insult. There are so called calligraphers with many years of practice who demonstrate a lack of understanding of their own craft, so its not surprising that many non calligraphers also remain ignorant.

Indeed. Retrofitting. Non-ideal.
The least I'm asking is: let's admit that's what it is.

Like trying to kick an addiction, admission is the first step. I'm not asking anybody to go cold turkey. I don't think I can either. I had bacon this morning. Because I enjoy it. Not because I pretend lard is good for me.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I guess our disagreement is that I think that the moving front of the tool does add a lot of humanity and aesthetic value to letters. 

I recently started to learn Hebrew calligraphy, and was delighted to see how much the broad pen would do on its own to produce beautiful shapes. And I could see where it caused readability problems. But the point is that there is a lot of gain as well as problems in written shapes. 

So I think just saying forget about written shapes is a mistake, because you lose something. And unlike you--at least in past comments--I don't think there's a great revolution in reading to be had by more radical departure from written shapes. I am looking just to better 'micro-adjustment,' as Peter Enneson calls it, of weights, proportions, joins, spacing to improve text type.
