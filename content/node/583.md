body: I don&#39;t have a great picture but I am looking for the font that &#34;IC&#34;
  on the cup is done in. I will probably go to panera bread this weekend so I will
  get a better sample if it isn&#39;t solved. Thanks for your time! <BR> <BR>

  body: Its like fontesque sans but not. It is loopier, but I know it&#39;s a font
    because on the line below it used the same font as the title &#34;IC&#34; and
    the letters were consistent. <BR> <BR>_Tom

    not as curly. The dot on the &#34;i&#34; is close though. <BR> <BR>_Tom '

    isn&#39;t it, either, but it&#39;s close and free, if you&#39;re on a Windows
    machine &#40;or have a conversion utility&#41;.

  body: I was thinking eywire / image club ... Paisley <BR>bold or something? Maybe
    I can dig up an old <BR>Eyewire catalog. It seems to be of the Image <BR>Club
    ilk. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, the other font is indeed Fink, but Tom is looking <BR>for
    the font on the cup. <BR> <BR>I did the same thing when I came to the thread last
    night! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>bj

    appear to be so. Just wanted to save you the trouble. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    I&#39;ve got 4 variants of IC&#39;s Paisley &#40;Came bundled with something years
