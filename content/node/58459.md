body: "I posted this question 2 days ago on MyFonts/What the font?, but no answer
  as of yet. I'd like to buy it, use it, and give the designer credit. My pirated
  copy, but not by me, is called AlchemyGoldA24, version 4.1 (according to SuitcaseFusion).
  The only references I can find are Czech, and no designer or foundry is mentioned.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have information regarding this font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alchemy_4403.jpg]"

  body: "It seems to be one of a class of (possibly) Alchemist-themed fonts, including
    Emigre's Mason and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/newcomen/regular/characters.html|Newcomen]],
    by Insigne. Font Bureau has Sofia, and I think I have seen others. Parts of your
    font seem familiar, but I don't know where I saw them before.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
