<p>Or am I wrong?</p>
<p>With regards to discussing free fonts on the crit board:</p>
<p>Could the different concept of authorship exemplified in FOSS add an interesting dimension here? As in, it makes perfect sense to bring in a typeface you did not design yourself yet still try to fix it?</p>
<p>There are many existing FOSS fonts out there, of which a large part could presumably use tender loving typocare. Wouldn’t it be a very efficient way to increase the quality of FOSS type when, for example, your spacing in OpenOffice looks off, you just bring up the font here and let the community help you in fixing it?</p>
<p>Point 2</p>
<p>I didn’t see a who’s going to Robothon thread yet, but I am, more of you who are interested in the foss type world?</p>

<p>I feel any significant growth in open source fonts will be driven by the type of people (students, beginners, savvy marketeers, special interest folks) who have traditionally given fonts away for free. Moving to OS licenses is a good move for them and the community.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Eric. I&rsquo;m the director of Alt Indie Typo, the privately run group working on the &ldquo;free, open source font superfamily, starting with a linear sans serif&rdquo; you mention. I recently retired from Typophile but my involvement in the FOSS movement necessitates a posting on this thread.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There will soon be a spiffy looking distribution channel for FOSS fonts, maintained by people who as far as I can tell are serious about designer’s IP.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have very little involvement with the Open Font Library, but enuff to know it is run by good-intentioned peeple who lack experience making fonts. Mainly they have experience making open source software. You only have to examine some of the 160-odd free fonts in the openfontlibrary to see the general lack of quality and almost complete lack of usable, useful fonts in the collection. So far there isn&rsquo;t much at all in the collection many web designers would even consider using.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is an effort initiated by the typographic community ‘to make a free, open source font superfamily, starting with a linear sans serif’. It’s proceedings are not public, which may not accord to the working ethic of the FOSS community, but would that matter if they manage to produce great fonts that are licensed under a free license?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Alt Indie Typo operates as a closed group in order to get the exacting task of designing our text type series done and get all the variants and weights of font made. We leave discussion to venues like Typophile and openfontlibrary.org</p>
<p>I drafted a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->management framework<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the purpose of obtaining a specification for what web designers want in the way of open source web fonts, and the response has been disappointing in the extreme.</p>
<p>Web designers and the Openfontlibrary.org are very keen on having a high quality open source text font superfamily yet they have so far totally failed to generate a spec for the work. This situation is unworkable and impractical so Alt Indie Typo has gone ahead and drafted its own specification for the text font superfamily we will build. I just completed an A - Z, a - z draft of the serif variant this morning to get an idea of how the final design might look.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Could the different concept of authorship exemplified in FOSS add an interesting dimension here? As in, it makes perfect sense to bring in a typeface you did not design yourself yet still try to fix it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Nope. That approach smacks of naivity and lack of experience at developing fonts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are many existing FOSS fonts out there, of which a large part could presumably use tender loving typocare. Wouldn’t it be a very efficient way to increase the quality of FOSS type when, for example, your spacing in OpenOffice looks off, you just bring up the font here and let the community help you in fixing it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&ldquo;tender loving typo care&rdquo; ? I&rsquo;m compelled to ask you a question: have you designed any typefaces yourself? Your example involving off spacing in OpenOffice seems naive and attuned to the open source software community, and your solution even more naive. If the spacing of Alt Indie Typo&rsquo;s text font superfamily looks off in OpenOffice it will be because OpenOffice isn&rsquo;t handling the fonts properly or because some users can&rsquo;t handle the fonts properly. Proposing to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; a well-developed font by bringing it here to typophile&rsquo;s crit board is an ad hoc reaction that could be avoided altogether with a few judicious tracking adjustments in OpenOffice.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I didn’t see a who’s going to Robothon thread yet, but I am, more of you who are interested in the foss type world?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I dwell in Melbourne, Australia and have no interest in Robothon. My interest in the FOSS type word is limited to the bare minimum required to communicate with a group of peeple who, in my experience, have bitten off more than they can chew.</p>
<p>For example, there is a basic and serious problem with open source collaborative font building projects. Version control software only works on plain text files. That&rsquo;s fine for text projects like Wikipedia but hopeless for vector font project file formats like Fontlab&rsquo;s .VFB files. So technically no way exists for open source collaboration to take place with a version control system to allow a typeface design or font build file to be wound back to a desired point in its development history with a revert command the way Wikipedians do every day at Wikipedia.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a great free font editor, a great free font scripting library, and a very handy free-as-in-beer SDK (though I am just echoing the consensus here, can not claim personal authority on these matters :-o<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Compared to Fontlab, FontForge is not great, and since you&rsquo;re not an authority on these matters I don&rsquo;t understand why you say FontForge is great.</p>
<p>Take it all in good faith because it&rsquo;s meant that way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with the prevalent opinion that a font which would be stuck together in a Wikipedia style direct democracy scenario would be awful. But a font is not comparable to a Wikipedia page—rather, it could be comparable to Wikipedia itself: a product driven by the vision of an individual, but coming to substance through the contributions of the community.</p>
<p>This is my own theory which I am [[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl|propagating]] to both sides of the fence:</p>
<p>Multi-authorship is overrated, and is the least interesting part of foss.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Multi-authorship is silly<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The driving force for multi-author projects such as Wikipedia is our incredible skill level in conforming to the others around us.
This is a powerful mechanism: because we have such a stubborn drive towards consensus, that even a completely random &lsquo;crowd-sourced&rsquo; population can create a coherent cultural artefact which, even more strikingly, comes across as if it could have been written by a single author. (dixit a FoF, will look up)</p>
<p>Yet here is the important part: very often the wrong conclusion is drawn from this observation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Leads people to conclude</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is simply not true. Rather, you can say:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which might make it a handy artefact, and very interesting from a sociological perspective, but not really interesting in other ways.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->distributed authorship is great<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But multi-authorship is not really a prevalent model in open source development.
And IMHO neither should it be in foss type design.
In my view it is not about loads of people working together on one design, but many people working on their own versions and sharing the more general smart ideas people come up with.</p>
<p>In open source, just like in the arts the need individuals feel to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->differentiate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from others plays a very large role.
Inspiring to me was the surprisingly analytical description of this model in Eric Stephen Raymonds &lsquo;Homesteading the Noosphere&rsquo;, and more exactly the chapter [[http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s04.html|Open Source and Ownership]].</p>
<p>This is much more interesting than democratic collaboration IMHO, as it is more close to how science or art works: you produce something immaterial that you freely spread (‘knowledge’, ‘artistic ideas’) and find alternative economic strategies to enable you to keep doing so.</p>
<p>This approach has arguably brought us some nice things.</p>
<p>The big added quality of this approach is, that you can build on the work of others. Sort of like type revivals, but more directly, because you can quote your contemporaries.</p>
<p>You could see it that way: an individual or a small team is still responsible for a design, but they are feel to pick and choose the bits they like and want to adapt from other designs. This might seem a strange idea for a type designer, because it seems you could just go and knock about a new typefaces borrowing bits and pieces from others; but the reason this works is social pressure. Because you are in a small transparent community with a steep barrier of entry, you will only want to adapt somebody others work when it is obvious to your pears that you are using it in an apt way.</p>
<p>The reasoning is that you can create with higher sophistication and adapt to smaller niches if you don’t have to reinvent the wheel all the time. Like when you use a JavaScript framework like jQuery: you have a tried and tested piece of code that abstracts away from the browsers implementations so you don’t have to deal with all the mundane details in your code.</p>
<p>The type equivalent could be making an open source ‘framework family’, an unassuming but robust set of glyphs upon which others can base their work, yet are subsequently able to push back specific refinements that also apply to the master.</p>
<p>That actually sounds like a good idea IMHO. Will look into that—the first step could be just stripping Gentium from all it’s baroqueness :-)</p>
<p>Basically it is all about the power of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forking<!-- raw HTML omitted -->—the social code hosting site [[http://github.com/|GitHub]] is all about that. In I think the OFL license really anticipates these mechanisms very cleverly: by making it very clear that if you start redistributing a modified version of a font, you should give it a new name and make clear that this is a new font.</p>
<p>This should prevent what of course is the worrying scenario for type designers: a multitude of ill conceived versions of their cherished designs floating around.</p>
<p>The GitHub example is inspiring to me: &amp;with the UFO format as an xml based representation of a font, you have the perfect basis for this kind of granular design, because it lends itself extremely well to versioning systems such as SVN and Git. And you could even create a graphical interface to the public API of GitHub.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello James</p>
<p>Thanks for your long reply.
We cross posted, and I think my comment addresses some of your concerns.
I think it is totally up to you which way you choose to make this font—if you heard a critique of your closed model, it wasn’t meant that way.</p>
<p>No I don’t design type.
And I don’t use OpenOffice.</p>
<p>Why I feel the need to weigh in because I am a user of both digital type and open source software,
and for me both are not living up to their potential.</p>
<p>I can imagine your assesment of me being naive, but I don’t think that’s the case—I think that by being neither structurally involved in Foss or in type design, I will I will indeed overlook all kinds of small problems that occur in both fields—but IMHO also some of the dogma.</p>
<p>I have a practice as a conceptual artist for which I make use of both old and new media.
And I feel the digital world does not yet offer me the possibilities to express myself the way I would want to.</p>
<p>I use both closed and open software under OS X.
And for me this combination is extremely productive.</p>
<p>Because for day to day stuff I use proprietary, and ‘everything just works’. At the same time, when I have a very specific need that’s not met by the market, I can use an enormous wealth of open software through MacPorts.</p>
<p>Which for Unix standards is still pretty much ‘everything just works’.
No this would be nice and jolly, but the tech geek world
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->lacks any fundamental notion of either the function or the value of visual communication<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So why would I care?
Because tech geekery is shaping technology, which is shaping the media I can express myself in.
So I decided any mutual understanding between the two worlds would be a good thing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well my own main preocupation with type is as a tool to connect to the visual part of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Since these typefaces should preferably be free, and seeing how arriving at only a few decent free typefaces already proves to be such an ordeal, I’d say the hopes for a decent amount of historic free revival are slim.</p>
<p>But with this sort of distributed authorship I could imagine, for example, the following scenario:</p>
<p>A library has a specific and rich collection of late 19th century books from one specific press, that cut its own type.</p>
<p>They decide to digitize the collection. And they commision a font designer to design digital type for it, because they want to digitise it in a way that is at the same time accesible and flexible, and fitting the visual presentation of the originals.</p>
<p>The type director, or lead designer, starts studying the portfolio of typefaces. He takes all the time, effort and dedication as he would in a normal assignment. But he is not studying one typeface: he is studying a collection of type, looking for its essential characteristics, finding out which individual differences he wants to emphasize and which ones he will attach less value too.</p>
<p>He proposes a master plan [sic], and if the client agrees, the distributed part starts. At first he will just have a few assistants helping him set up the main skeletons for the prototypical faces of the collection. But after that point he will start to look for specific designers that can start working on specific problems that they specialise in.</p>
<p>This is where the forking starts, when different designers start working on different parts of different designs. The lead is the one who is minding the grand plan, but at any given point is able to use his very specific judgment on details if necessary. He is also the one who can pull in changes from one font and push them back to others.</p>
<p>You will end up with a collection of typefaces, the richness of which the lead designer could not have created on his own. Not only for lack of time, but also because the unique skills the contributors have contributed, skills not found combined in one person. Yet on the other hand, the type collection has all the qualities you would attribute to a traditional type family as designed by an individual. The different fonts are not described as individual entities, but in their relationship to each other, starting from the prototypical design bases created by the lead designer, who is also the one who has been making sure the collection works as a whole.</p>

With the experts I meant typophile, and the initiative was referring to James’ project.
Surely that is more than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a handful of well intentioned part-timers and amateurs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?
I was just trying to recapulate what I have been reading in these threads: the willingness of the typophile community to offer their critique and insight regarding foss typefaces.</p>
<p>As it stands I don&rsquo;t think there are many type experts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inside<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the world of open source, so I guess we assess the situation in a similar way?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I feel any significant growth in open source fonts will be driven by the type of people (students, beginners, savvy marketeers, special interest folks) who have traditionally given fonts away for free. Moving to OS licenses is a good move for them and the community. Rather than just post fonts sans-EULA or with a EULA full of holes that they made up or copied from someone else, OSS licenses are a step up in that regard.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I fully agree. And I also see how this development could be good for the type community by getting rid of shoddy licenses. At the same time, since you say it’s more or less the same phenomenon as with previous free fonts, the impact can’t be that huge on the professional community? Because this whole free-as-in-beer free-as-in-freedom distinction has nowhere near the relevance it has for the Foss community.</p>
<p>But the benefits to Open Source would be huge IMHO.
Because a talented type student might not be able to make a typeface like a veteran designer, he will make a typeface which is 100x better than that of someone who just feels like drawing some letters on a rainy sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>So if all these eager to prove themselves cultural professionals start using OSS licences as opposed to giving away proprietary freebies in exchange for e-mail addresses or whatever scheme they come up with, wouldn’t that constitute a great starting point for a Foss world that is more aware of the value of visual communication?

<p>@Schrijver
One of the major flaws of FOSS is that there isn&rsquo;t a single authority to accept blame for something that is utter crap. What is also true, and not a flaw, is that in the FOSS or Open Source community ALL individuals are supposed to accept responsibility for something that is utter utter crap and then FIX IT. That works great for code.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t with a font.</p>
<p>A font is so delicate, so demanding of consistency, that having any more than one or two different designers working on it breaks the flow. A font is not a grab bag of glyphs, it is a collection of highly synchronized and cohesive designs that are meant to be a solitary whole.</p>
<p>That, by its very concept, precludes the development of fonts by a group.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Consider this wacky model for a collaborative font project.</p>
<p>One font designer when actually builds and tunes &ldquo;master glyphs&rdquo;. For example: an A is a master, an Aring is not. The font would be designed using a minimal, modular system. No glyphs with accents. No unecessary flips (brackets, less than, backslash etc.) Any characters that can be constructed automatically or by following simple instructions would be left out. A spec doc would specify all of this. Them more glyphs than can be made by following simple instructions, the less burden there is on the font designer.</p>
<p>A team of reliable type testers who send detailed reports back to the type designer and the rest of the team. Moving bezier handles isn&rsquo;t time consuming, knowing where to move them is. You need good testers who will actually print stuff on actual paper and look at it with actual eyes. If your testers just look at stuff in Fontlab and say &ldquo;looks nice.&rdquo; then it can cause a lot of work down the line. Especially with interpolation. You want to make sure the source fonts are perfect or you can end up with he same mistake repeated 64 times, adding to the font designer&rsquo;s workload. So, you need real, professional typographers that happen to enjoy working for free.</p>
<p>A kerner. If only one person kerns, no version control is required. They just need to upload the latest kern file. With class based kerning it&rsquo;s not so tough, even for a large project. It&rsquo;s work but one hotshot kerner with skills can do it if they know how to deal (and cheat) with classes.</p>
<p>OpenType coding. This can be done with version control software as it can be done in a separate text file. Could be 1000 coders.</p>
<p>Autogenerate scripting. People who write code for accent generation, ordinals, fractions and other &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; aspects of font design which can be automated. This person would be involved with writing the spec as well. They would have to confer with the font designer whether on not a glyph can be autogenerated, or if autogeneration shouldn&rsquo;t be used.</p>
<p>Font monkeys. They build glyphs based on the font designer&rsquo;s instructions. For example:
afii10048 - generate I_E_O decompose E and extract the midline. place the O two periods distance away from the I. Adjust length of horizontal line and remove overlaps. Copy right sidebearing from the O. That sort of thing. Font monkey may not be the best name for this position.</p>
<p>Interpolators. Blending regular and bold to make semibold aint no thang. The font designer probably wouldn&rsquo;t even need to be involved in minor interpolations. Just the testers. It&rsquo;s often more of a cleanup job than a design job. The font designer would have the final tweak on each interpolation but the initial cleanup should be done by someone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve thought about for years. Just as a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario. Multiple font designers aimlessly poking around at a font sounds like a nightmare. It might work in an office environment but over the net it&rsquo;s a wheelbarrow of pain.</p>

<p>Yes, to me it sounded a bit like what happened when mass production was introduced in factories. Alot of different people doing one little part of the whole. You know, the conveyor-belts and whatnot.</p>
<p>But when designing a typeface a coherent end product is the goal, plus that it is oft times very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I don&rsquo;t really see how some of the proposed workflows would work in that sense.</p>

<p>But seriously, it seems that one problem with the additions to Utopia and the others has been a lack of continued involvement by a type designer who is responsible for giving continued instructions and for ensuring overall quality. At least that&rsquo;s what I hope has been true when I look at some of the modifications I&rsquo;ve seen&ndash;others haven&rsquo;t been so bad. &ldquo;Let the monkeys loose&rdquo; is not a good strategy in most every circumstance. Does anyone know of an instance where typodermic&rsquo;s scheme has been more fully implemented with an open font?</p>
<p>Concerning the problem of creative unity and producing a cohearant whole, I&rsquo;d be willing to believe that such a workflow wouldn&rsquo;t be optimal, and it wouldn&rsquo;t replace the work of talented type designers, but could it have a place in helping to produce workhorse fonts that aren&rsquo;t terrible? For example, I wish I knew more details of the TeX Gyre fonts. It seems that they&rsquo;re paying to support someone who&rsquo;s working to make reasonable, semi-automated extensions of the Postscript fonts, with some testing and oversight for the final product. Is this an example of the suggested model?</p>

<p>I think that’s exactly what should happen were such a collaborative effort to work?</p>
<p>IMHO the moment that can happen is when there is an economic potential for this workflow—I don’t see where this niche might be just yet.</p>
<p>A lot of influential open source projects are very much associated with their lead developer. [[http://jquery.com/|jQuery]] is John Resig, [[http://rubyonrails.org/|Ruby on Rails]] is David Hanemeier Hanson. But Resig works for Mozilla and Hanson for a web consultancy firm ([[http://www.37signals.com/|37signals]]). Mozilla makes browsers, so they benefit by web apps taking off, 37signals makes web apps with the Rails framework, so they benefit from it being popular.</p>
<p>So I guess there has to be an investing party that sees a potential for foss fonts improving the experience of their core product (like SIL with Gentium, no? isn’t that ultimately meant for improving the experience of bible reading?)—and believes that a collaborative workflow benefits the development process…</p>
<p>PS I love the related foss concept of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life|Benevolent Dictator for Live]] :-)

<p>Were they made using the method I described? It&rsquo;s not just about perfect letterforms. It&rsquo;s about good planning, a coherent spec and an organized team or professionals.</p>
<p>@scott. I should have explained that everyone involved would have to be a talented font designer. Everyone involved would have to be an experienced professional for a project like that to work. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong about font monkeys. There&rsquo;s no difference between font designer and font monkey. That&rsquo;s just their position on the project. So someone could be a font monkey on project A and font maestro on project B. Getting a team like that to work with no money might sound implausible. That&rsquo;s because it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I believe to be the ideal method of creating a large collaborative font family. If you take the same formula, replace most of the people with inexperienced amateurs and one professional, you&rsquo;ll likely end up with one frustrated professional. I&rsquo;m not saying you can make a collaborative font using other methods but if anyone can poke holes in my plan and suggest how it could be improved, go ahead.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: I don&rsquo;t want to get involved in a collaborative project. I just had this idea in my mind about how such a thing could work so I thought I&rsquo;d share it.</p>

Those glyphs would be defined in the spec. Since the font designer has the only version of the font, they just have to load the latest kerning table. Once you get into the thousands of glpyhs, there&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be much that can&rsquo;t be added to an existing class.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->See my comments on glyphs above. Also, there’s a lot of potential for feature interaction, which requires that feature ordering be defined up front, and&hellip; stuff.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The font designer wouldn&rsquo;t need to be involved in that once the project starts. Since all the proposed features would be have been defined in the spec, what would the font designer have to do other than follow the spec. In fact the testers would be responsible for making sure it all works, the font designer wouldn&rsquo;t even have to be involved at all.</p>
<p>If the project were an unplanned feature creep monstrosity, then yes, that would be a problem. But, if it were properly planned and spec&rsquo;d out, it wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a fair point: if the spec is thorough, right down to exact glyphs, then the rest of the stuff will follow pretty well. Even occasional spec changes will at least be well-known and centralized, so everybody can work from the same info.</p>
<p>This does of course necessitate a detailed spec. It&rsquo;s also possible that, say, some person coding features will be the first to realize that the spec was incomplete when she realizes that some particular feature interaction requires more glyphs. But that should be manageable.</p>

<p>I ended up not pursuing it, for similar reasons that James Arbogast suggested - it&rsquo;s a lot of work to set something like that up, and it&rsquo;s not clear the results would be very rewarding.</p>
<p>openfontlibrary.org has been disappointing, partly because they haven&rsquo;t reached anywhere near parity with commercial sites for just showing the font, and partly because there&rsquo;s no emphasis on promoting high-quality fonts above random dross.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think the same would be true for a quality open font project. A single designer needs to be the Tzar - even if that slows down the project. Whether the project has 1 or 100 contributors, someone needs to take design responsibility. That&rsquo;s true even for commercial foundries, where one person adds glyphs, one kerns, one write OT code, etc.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t assume that all free/open projects are even interested in outside contributors. Many are, but some people choose open licenses as a way to distribute the software and allow derivatives, not to get others involved. With a good FOSS licensing model, people can make their own derivatives if the speed is too glacial or the designer wants to do it all themselves. (Obligatory apologies to everyone for the long Gentium development cycle, which does involve a number of people.)</p>
<p>One quick clarification on Gentium. Although it does support the goals of SIL International, it was originally my personal project, and later embraced by SIL. Those goals, BTW, go much further than bible reading - linguistics, literacy, literature production, language preservation and the like.</p>

If you could do it all over again, what would you change? Specifically, the things surrounding the development of Gentium or the organization of others working on it, etc.? Your unique insight on this would be greatly appreciated, since you&rsquo;re one of the few who has one of these projects, even if the speed is glacial.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@James you speak about the FOSS community like an entity that you can communicate with as a party, this is something I saw more often in these threads—Why doesn’t the FOSS community pose a more clear brief for what they want?</p>
<p>But I think FOSS is no single entity, it is just the sum of all people who happen to be involved in FOSS projects. This might be a strength (because it allows it to fill very specific needs proprietary software will never be able to address), in these circumstances it shows as a weakness: you can’t ask FOSS anything, at least not in the same way you would ask a costumer or a company.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear of the disappointing experience, though.</p>
<p>@Raph &amp; @Victor I really apreciate your taking the time to comment on this thread. @Raph your site has been a great inspiration for me thinking about which role open source can have in type. @Victor I apologize for my simplistic articulation of your project—I think it is an unprecedented accomplishment!</p>
<p>But this brings me to a specific point, which I myself failed to address in the examples I gave…
It seems there is a consensus on the need for a Tzar.
I definitely agree. But IMHO the radical thing open source changes is not so much the possibility to have one Tzar with a lot of footmen, but the ability to have Tzar’s easily pick up where they deem other Tzar’s to have stopped.</p>
<p>And what to me is evident, is that this how culture works anyway. It is like making a revival. There was a designer with a vision. You build upon what he has done, and in the process make it your own. And the original still exists.</p>
<p>The thing open source can do is take that process, but allow it to take place much more rapidly, because you do not have to wait more than a century for something to pass into the public domain.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We shouldn’t assume that all free/open projects are even interested in outside contributors.

<p>Exactly. We need to get over the fear of open source being about wanton collaboration blurring typographic vision. It can just as well be a catalyst in enabling the production of a multitude of diverse and highly individualist expressions.</p>
<p>Licensing your own work under on open source license to me says: I presume this can be valuable to other people in a way I don’t know yet. Or: I presume this can be valuable to other people in a way I can not concentrate on myself.</p>
<p>A great example I think of this reasoning by @James releasing his Fry glyphs.
Knowing he was not going to have the time to make a font out of it anyway, giving it away makes a lot of sense: you spend time making something nice.</p>
<p>And while we have been talking about these things on a hypothetical level, these ways of collaboration are actually taking place, showing that at least in part the lack of these kind of projects has had to do with a lack of suitable technology. With versioning systems going mainstream, and the UFO format as an XML based font description format, the technical groundwork is there IMHO.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->concretely<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>@James donated the Fry glyphs late January, @Klepas started a project a few days later, the files were up on GitHub in the UFO format Feb 8th. While I was busy writing on typophile last weekend, I mentioned a student I tutor the Open Baskerville URL in an e-mail. The next day he ([[http://robmientjes.nl/|Rob]]) had forked the project, and had actually started drawing glyphs for it!</p>
<p>So this week he has been making his additions to his own fork
<a href="http://github.com/rbmntjs/open-baskerville/commits/master">http://github.com/rbmntjs/open-baskerville/commits/master</a>
And friday @klepas pulled Rob’s additions back in to the original repository
<a href="http://github.com/klepas/open-baskerville/commits/master">http://github.com/klepas/open-baskerville/commits/master</a></p>
<p>The workings of GitHub are also explained on the homepage <a href="http://klepas.org/openbaskerville/">http://klepas.org/openbaskerville/</a>
Seeing how the [[http://unifiedfontobject.org/|UFO]] format is XML-based and concise, it is perfect for versioning.
But of course looking at text is still not a very pleasant way to browse a fonts assets.</p>
<p>But every different glyph has it’s own concise XML file, and translating that to SVG with XSLT or the like should be perfectly possible.</p>
<p>So even though there is no font yet, at least we have a proof of concept that this way of working is technologically possible.
It also shows the power of open licensing. @James donated the glyphs without knowing @Klepas would pick them up. @Klepas started the project without knowing Rob would start to contribute. And if @james is still coming to Robothon, we might be able to have a look at what his glyphs have been up to, a mere month after he let them loose, since Rob will also be attending.</p>
<p>For me this experience combined with the substantial way in which we have been able to explore these ideas on the forum this week, gives me the incentive to say, that for now I will try and light a fire under the open source font movement…</p>
<p>I’ll get back on this :-)</p>

<p>Presumably, if there was something I wished were different, I&rsquo;d change it. I&rsquo;m still directing the development of the project, so I have that control.</p>
<p>We solved the licensing problem - almost - with the SIL Open Font License, but there are still issues surrounding how we handle copyright for contributions. Do we require contributors to assign the copyright to us? Do we include their copyrights alongside ours? Do we offer both? Each of these has troublesome aspects and requires administrative effort.</p>
<p>The most challenging issue is managing those contributions. Gentium is a big enough project that I have a hard time letting potential contributors know what holes still remain and what types of contributions I might appreciate. Then how do you manage the actual contribution process (communication, submission, review, incorporation), handle formats and metadata, keep track of contributed elements? You also need everything submitted in all styles (regular, italic - with interpolation-friendly bold and bold italic). And when you hit technical problems (overlapping contours, duplicated knots, other bugs), who fixes them? It all becomes a massive investment in administrative time, which - frankly - I&rsquo;d rather spend designing.</p>
<p>Having said that, I know that the software development community has made great strides in this area. Textual glyph formats such as UFO have held great promise, and I&rsquo;ve tried to use them, but I&rsquo;ve yet to see a system that reduces the admin load for larger projects. A system that does would not only serve the open font development community, but be useful for the commercial font foundries, both large and small.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re: Managing Contributions</p>
<p>First, hi Victor! It seems these discussions always break down into how fonts can&rsquo;t work in an open source software model. I get that. The recent swing in the conversation to version control and contribution management is welcome. It seems to me that this is where the open source community could really help a collaborative font effort, and type designers generally.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In recent discussions we font folk have been daring open source folk to provide a design brief. It might make more sense for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to give <!-- raw HTML omitted -->them<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a design brief for the web application required to pull it off.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Surely the result would be useful to the type design community for commercial projects as well. If we each stick with what we&rsquo;re good at, it just might be possible for both parties to benefit.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A very crude idea about what such an application might look like:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;m envisioning a web application that is the centralized repository for the font project. In my &ldquo;limited&rdquo; experience with collaborative font projects, removing the sprawl from contributor hard-drives seems vital. Having a central visual reference that shows missing puzzle pieces would be equally crucial. Permissions would define the roles suggested (Tzar, Monkey etc tbd). Contributors could check-out &ldquo;under construction&rdquo; glyphs for a limited time (like a library). When you check out the &ldquo;germandbls&rdquo; glyph you get a package containing: any existing versions of the glyph, notes from the Tzar, links to design resources for the glyph (see diacritics project.cz etc) and any components that would be helpful in designing the glyph (in this case the lc f and s). Tzars could communicate vision and revision effectively. Clearly thought needs to be put into the format of the files. Keeping everything online would encourage participation: an online glyph editor with package contents readily available for reference seems ideal, but difficult to implement. Package download, edit, upload seems easier, but more limiting ( perhaps a UFO-&gt;EPS-&gt;UFO or UFO-&gt;VBF-&gt;UFO on a glyph by glyph basis to allow vector drawing programs to get in on the mix? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main goals would be:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
• For Tzars, maximize single-ness of vision and minimize admin headache
• For Monkeys, breaking tasks into well-defined, bite-sized chunks (one glyph, or group of glyphs)</p>
<p>Obviously developing this is a gargantuan task. But many hands make light work, right? Haha. Thoughts?</p>

<p>As for the collaboration application, I&rsquo;d hope it would work well for managing a 4 style family with modest glyph set. Gentium would certainly push the limit of any manager or tool. But I can see SIL being excited about giving small language groups a tool with just enough oversite to organically generate their own extended language support or new creations - but realistically this would require an online glyph editor, training and extensive wizardry I&rsquo;ve not given thought too :-) Such as the difficulty of localizing such an app for such a people group.

<p>@Randy</p>
<p>Thanks for chiming in!</p>
<p>I agree with you in doubting a ‘spec’ is all that important. Like if there would somehow appear a spec for a FOSS font family, and we would have some money, some computers, some drinks and a few weeks in a nice house near lake Como, type designing hotshots could just conjure up a nice and flexible type family, give it away, and forever end the need for free fonts and typographic collaboration in general.</p>
<p>I am interested in a distributed model of authorship, for which open source and collaboration happen to provide the means. I think these models provide benefits that can not be attained through the traditional ways of working. If I just wanted a typeface I would buy it (really!).</p>
<p>Like @V said, the tools needed for such a way of working could just as well be suited for commercial foundries.</p>
<p>But did any of you check out the links I posted?
Open Baskerville is working in this sort of way right now.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Contributions<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With regards to copyright of contributions, there are established practices in the open source world, I found this one to be pretty concise: <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/opensource/contributions.html">http://www.movabletype.org/opensource/contributions.html</a></p>
<p>But I do see @V how that generates a large amount of amount of administrative hassle. Though I guess it is not necessarily designers that would be handling this. And like @Randy says, it makes sense to expect some collaboration on these matters from the Open Source world.

<p>This is a collaborative coding model applied to collaborative fonting. Certainly there are some aspects of the coding model that should inform collaborative fonting. However, this tool would only be helpful to someone steeped in the coding world. Who is your audience? Who are your collaborators? For this to be a success it needs to look and work a lot more like the latest release of Wordpress. Sure you could blog from the command line, but 99.9% of the people would never do it without the slick UI. Make it work for muppets like me who cant operate a computer without a mouse. Please? Short of that, this effort will fizzle on the launchpad.</p>

<p>EDIT: BTW, I wasn&rsquo;t saying a design spec from the open source community is not important. I definitely agree that it is, if any useful type is to be developed.

Open Baskerville is working in this sort of way right now.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I did take a look at the Fry’s Baskerville project (you can download the files without installing git or anything).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with you in doubting a ‘spec’ is all that important.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But without a spec, without somebody who wants – and is able – to judge the quality of contributions, this is going exactly in the direction I expected. In the worst case, the additions are sub-standard, like you can see in the image below. In the best case you end up redrawing someone else’s glyphs (Fry’s in this case). I&rsquo;m sceptical about this kind of &ldquo;open&rdquo; collaboration, but of course I&rsquo;d love to be proven wrong, by a well-executed project, but again this is not it.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/large_frys_extensions_5163.png]</p>
<p>The first line is original, as drawn by James after the scans. The other two lines are the contributions by your student. I&rsquo;m sorry to say most of them are badly drawn (more visible in close-up) and some don&rsquo;t follow the original style. Which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing in itself – everyone was a beginner at some point – but you have to keep in mind these glyphs haven&rsquo;t been posted on the TP critique section, where probably some people would have been glad to help improve them, but they are presented as the progress in a project which seems to aim at no less than revolutionizing the way collaborative typedesign works. As I said, all contributions would be measured to the original Fry’s Baskerville, so the possibly best result would still be reproducing someone else’s work.</p>
<p>Do something original instead.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like @V said, the tools needed for such a way of working could just as well be suited for commercial foundries.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Maybe, but I guess the established foundries already have their internal production systems, and I doubt they would be willing to publicize large parts of them in order to get contributions from FOSS people.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FontQA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? That is an open-source project for font quality assurance licenced under GPL. I&rsquo;d have to ask, but I think there were not many contributions, if any at all, from anybody not directly involved in the project. Why is that? I think the audience is too small, font production is a too specialized area in which a few people already have their own solution, while the majority won&rsquo;t even see the need for such a tool.</p>
<p>It may be the same for the proposed &ldquo;visual glyph versioning and font production system&rdquo;. It would have to be developed by people who really use it, and know a thing or two about professional font production. And then probably it would be next to useless to other people whose collaboration workflow differs.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I truly expect the Open Source community to do anything for me, I’d better be willing to enter their world a bit, if only to speak the same language. In this case that would mean bucking up and actually using GIT. Plus, it makes requests much more effective.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Hear Hear! This is exactly the conclusion I came to myself, and the attitude I would like to be propagating!</p>
<p>Also, I think you are the first to on this thread to articulate the possibility of Open Source actually doing anything <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Great! Because why would you want to have anything to do with it otherwise? Speaking of motivations, I tried to formulate mine in the form of a [[http://typophile.com/node/55332|concise list @ my user blog]]</p>
<p>I would phrase one thing differently now though: the part that struck me about Open Source is IMHO <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a specific subset of open source<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I guess it is the part that has come in contact with both creativity and business. IMHO this is the world where the investment of entering a bit has a probable return of investment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the utopian super-easy GUI programs might come along—but for that we need to have entered a bit more, and a bit longer: and we would have had to have tried to redecorate the house up to the point where we feel comfortable sleeping over…</p>
<p>As example GH again, they promote themselves as Online project hosting for Open Source and Business code. They have a very clear business model, because public code is free to host, but they reason that the user experience will make you also want to host your private code there. So basically, Open Source development is the freemium they offer: if that does not show how the tables have turned, what will?</p>
<p>Where creativity comes into play IMHO is that the whole affair is steeped in the individualist logic of web 2.0. You want your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version of a package, and you want to be able to show your friends what you have. That might sound superficial instead of creative, but the underlying needs driving it are comparable IMHO: the struggle between the need for differentiation and self-expression on the one hand, and on the other hand the need to feel accepted by others.</p>
<p>Part of this echoes what @sii said earlier, about how OSS fonts will probably come about because of those interested in economical and social opportunities joining in as well. In that sense Open Baskerville might also be a good example, because even though I might be pointing you at this open source project, I myself have no background in open source, and the three authors involved in OpenB up to this point have a background in design, not in open source development. Now they might be mistaken by the opportunities these projects offer them, but the fact that they do so shows a significant change.</p>
<p>Yet arguably, the point of discussion is not on that, but rather on the question: to what extent does this impact the practice of the cutural industry (and of open source) as we know it? Because I think these interdisciplinary developments will fundamentally impact all parties involved, even if specific members choose not to investigate these fringes.</p>
<p>&amp;I do not agree with @Jens, but will come back on that.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was going to ask GitHub if they could maybe support some of my ventures, and seeing how I have been such a fanboy for them in this thread, I figured that it makes sense to state this now to avoid future confusion: it is not GitHub per se that constitutes the promise for these kind of models. They just happen to bring together two things I strongly believe in: empowering non-geeks by allowing them to use very specific technology, by focusing on what you can do it instead of what it does (fork it!). And propagating a distributed model for content, as opposed to a centralized one.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Another point to which I agree, and to which I would like to add a similar analogy:</p>
<p><em>If we ask the Open Source development world to respect the amount of skill and dedication which goes into the creation of a typeface, IMHO we should try and adequately asses the skill and dedication they bring to their software development.</em></p>
<p>Because with all the OFLB reserves flying around, isn’t it also obvious to everyone that their [[http://fontly.openfontlibrary.org|new site]] proves to be a major accomplishment in these areas? I find the design frankly to be the single best looking site I have seen in ages. Which is an even more able accomplishment when you realise they build it around MediaWiki—really, the blue and white one. They also managed to mash this up with CCHost, which should be a major technological pain in the -, and there is some superspiffy Javascript going on with the live glyph previews.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that Jens&rsquo;s criticism is correct. I also think that he means it in a helpful way, and I wouldn&rsquo;t dismiss it. Otherwise, why would he have taken the time to write it at all?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll elaborate: Many of those forms (especially the procent sign) are not correctly designed. For example, everything about that % seems off: it is too narrow, the slash shouldn&rsquo;t have a serif, and the top connecting stroke is out of place… I don&rsquo;t think that Fry&rsquo;s Baskerville is a calligraphic face, and that stylistic trait comes out of a certain writing style.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t have a printed specimen of Fry&rsquo;s Baskerville in front of me, but it must have included an Œ originally. Baskerville&rsquo;s types in any event had the Æ. I bet that the original Œ form would have looked different than what your student did.</p>
<p>You student&rsquo;s enthusiasm is to be applauded. But typeface design isn&rsquo;t something that you can just pick up and try out. Every glyph has to be as good as every other one in the fots (and family). I think that it might be best for him to try and get a glyph right on his own local computer first (including lots of revisions and print outs, etc.) before thinking of uploading it back to the project tree for inclusion.</p>

<p>Surprisingly on that particular glyph, the sheet I see reproduced in Tschichold&rsquo;s Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering is pretty close.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frys_oe_4138.png]</p>
<p>But even so, I agree that the criticism of Jens is valid. These are generally not well-drawn glyphs, and some are actively ugly, such as the @-sign.</p>
<p>The accessories I did for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Century Catalogue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are fairly decent and harmonize reasonably well with Baskerville, and I&rsquo;d be happy to donate those if they&rsquo;re wanted. They&rsquo;ll probably need some adjustment for weight and contrast.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I proposed the monowidth monoline concept.
The spec should be related to  the project&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;être if the product is to be meaningful and useful art or design.
In the new Baskerville glyphs shown, the design is certainly &ldquo;informed&rdquo; by the circumstances of its creation.</p>
<p>Now, if the Baskervile glyphs had been drawn by students of mine, I would have asked them to have another go, and eventually would have ended up with a number of different versions by different students, which I would be required by the authorities to grade from A to F.</p>
<p>It would perhaps be reasonable for OpenOpen fonts to have many alternates for each character, and many Stylistic Sets which use them in different ways. So if I don&rsquo;t like the default &ldquo;percent&rdquo; glyph, I can draw a new one and name it &ldquo;percent.shinn&rdquo;, and add a Stylistic Set: sub percent by percent.shinn. It would be nice if I could also name the Stylistic Set &ldquo;Shinn&rdquo;, rather than have it identified just by a number, as is now the case in the OpenType format.</p>
<p>Who gets to decide which is the default glyph for each character?</p>
<p>How are such decisions made in typical open source design projects?</p>

<p>This is way doing stuff helps the talking about it! I will admit the ‘just come over and show us your glyphs’ stance often taken around here is proving to be very true.</p>
<p>@dan_reynolds
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that it might be best for him to try and get a glyph right on his own local computer first (including lots of revisions and print outs, etc.) before thinking of uploading it back to the project tree for inclusion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I generally agree with you. However, two things: this is exactly the paradigm shift distributed versioning brings: there is no one central project tree. The project tree @Rob was pushing back to this week, was his own fork. On friday, @Klepas pulled back the design changes to the originating repository. However, @Klepas decided to designate @Rob as an author, meaning @Rob can no also push to the tree directly.</p>
<p>Thing two: Of course it would normally be a bit strange to draw your shared attention to the collaborative type design efforts of a graphic designer and a graphic design student, the latter’s contributions representing actually the first digital glyphs he has ever drawn. I of course explicitly asked his permission to do so, since the prospect of these  glyphs coming under the scrutiny of the typophile community is daunting.</p>
<p>That is why the glyphs in the form that @Jens saw them would never have been posted to the crit-board. A place like the crit-board has it’s place, definitely. But the association I have is not that of the place where you exchange thoughts in the middle of your process, but rather a place where you yourself take a step back and let others evaluate your work: like an evaluation at school, I guess.</p>
<p>What I meant to show is the ease with which these kind of new working methods allow you to chime in at any part of the process, to give your opinion, but not only in a desinterested way: you can become a user, a co-developer, and none of these roles are fixed.</p>
<p>@Jens The reason I do not agree with you is not because of your professional assesment of the glyphs, which (@Raph) might be valid. The thing is, they have no relevance to the point you are trying to make. I am not showing these glyphs as an example of a typeface, I intend to show a way of working. You asses on a snapshot out of this process, and subsequently dismiss the progress. That is like dismissing a video camera because the quality of the still pictures it makes do not live up to those of a photo camera.</p>
<p>Further down I expand on that.</p>
<p>@Nick_Shinn
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The spec should be related to the project’s raison d’être if the product is to be meaningful and useful art or design.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
+1!
IMHO, any spec. But I think that is the implicit assumption :-)</p>
<p>Only, I still do not really understand the kind of typeface you are proposing?
I am not really able to place things like metafont style.
Could you maybe elaborate a bit on the specific properties of this typeface, and the way they are relate to its context?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who gets to decide which is the default glyph for each character?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How are such decisions made in typical open source design projects?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Nick these are IMHO exactly the right questions, for which the Art Libre movement, as far as I can tell, has not proposed any substantial hypotheses. Open source programming seems to have a well documented history of how people deal with their differing opinions. But to be honest, I don’t think that at the moment we have actually seen any real open source design projects [1]. Most Open Source fonts are as far as I can tell still very much individual products. Which is rather unrelated to the promise of Open Source.</p>
<p>My hypothesis on why that is: if you are a computer programmer, you are very well aware of just how complicated a system a computer program is. You are less aware that visual communication is exactly the same in that regard: a complex system of interrelated signifiers.</p>
<p>Because how could you otherwise come up with a solution like stylesheets? It implies that the basic layout is hardcoded into the system, which is the last place where any designer would want it to be.</p>
<p>Which probably means we are allowed the opening move.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> It would be nice if I could also name the Stylistic Set “Shinn”, rather than have it identified just by a number, as is now the case in the OpenType format.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Sounds great, and if I am not mistaken this exactly what the concept of branches within Git allows you to do.
These sort of things could also be really handy in developing routines for things like subsetting, I guess…</p>
<p>Anyhow, in what follows I try to describe what a concrete Git-based workflow could be, taking OpenB as an example and trying to address some of the specific possibilities mentioned. I would like to try and add this sort of stuff to the wiki if @all sees the use for it? I already added a general page on [[Revision Control]].</p>
<p>@Raph the glyphs would be great! But IMHO this would have even more added value would if I we try and see if we can get that submitted through the versioning system, or maybe a ticket system (I heard GitHub has easy connection to LightHouse, which presumably is a hosted ticket system), because then we can assess the feasibility of that part of this workflow.</p>

<p>You might also have a branch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_Shinn_Extreme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which you normally keep synched with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_Shinn_WorkingCopy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but which you switch to when you have an exceptionally extreme aesthetic impulse :-)</p>
<p>You regulary push back your local repository to your hosted repository. There are no hard rules about how you want to do this: some might prefer to push back less often, with more coherent sets of commits–others would just have it push back automatically every 10 minutes or so, making it twitter-style coding.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->$ git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:YOURUSERNAME/open-baskerville.git<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You start working on a glyph on your own computer. No for you as a user Git is completely transparent. The only difference between a git-enabled folder and a normal folder, is that the former contains a directory called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.git<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which contains the revision history. Because it starts with a dot, it is normally invisible.</p>
<p>This also means there is no processing overhead. Nothing happens if you edit a file, save a file, or whatever. So you are free to tinker around. However, at any given moment where you think you made a change which is significant enough to version, you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->$ git commit -am<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You are prompted for a description, and the current version of the file is added to the revision history.</p>
<p>This works in a similarl way to wikis.</p>
<p>Why this is funky, is that this makes sense as a workflow even when you are not collaborating at all. It is basically granular backup. And by dividing your commits in logical steps, and describing them as you would to another person, you are firstly doing yourself a favor: your granular backup also becomes structured and searchable.

<p>In the sketched scenario, BTW, you do not only have backups, they are automatically off-site as well, since you push to a remote server.</p>

<p>I did not try out other distributed systems (Darcs, Bazaar, Mercurial), they are probably more alike then they are different, but git just so happens to be the on used for this project. @Rob taught he me how to use it in one hour yesterday. There are only two specific geek hoops:</p>

<p>If you have a student interested in type design, you should give him better advice than too add extra glyphs to this Baskerville. Why not have him draw his own lowercase letters? Those are a good place to start. After a few weeks or months of getting these working we&rsquo;ll together, he can move onto the next step. Type design does not happen over night, but it is still such an awesome thing! If he wants, he could give his letters a Baskervillian feel, or any other style he wants. But the point is, at this stage, the letters should be his own.</p>

<p>@dan_reynolds
I think that it might be best for him to try and get a glyph right on his own local computer first (including lots of revisions and print outs, etc.) before thinking of uploading it back to the project tree for inclusion.</p>
<p>I generally agree with you. However, two things: this is exactly the paradigm shift distributed versioning brings: there is no one central project tree. The project tree @Rob was pushing back to this week, was his own fork. On friday, @Klepas pulled back the design changes to the originating repository. However, @Klepas decided to designate @Rob as an author, meaning @Rob can no also push to the tree directly.</p>
<p>Thing two: Of course it would normally be a bit strange to draw your shared attention to the collaborative type design efforts of a graphic designer and a graphic design student, the latter’s contributions representing actually the first digital glyphs he has ever drawn. I of course explicitly asked his permission to do so, since the prospect of these glyphs coming under the scrutiny of the typophile community is daunting.</p>
<p>That is why the glyphs in the form that @Jens saw them would never have been posted to the crit-board. A place like the crit-board has it’s place, definitely. But the association I have is not that of the place where you exchange thoughts in the middle of your process, but rather a place where you yourself take a step back and let others evaluate your work: like an evaluation at school, I guess.</p>
<p>What I meant to show is the ease with which these kind of new working methods allow you to chime in at any part of the process, to give your opinion, but not only in a desinterested way: you can become a user, a co-developer, and none of these roles are fixed.</p>
<p>@Jens The reason I do not agree with you is not because of your professional assesment of the glyphs, which (@Raph) might be valid. The thing is, they have no relevance to the point you are trying to make. I am not showing these glyphs as an example of a typeface, I intend to show a way of working. You asses on a snapshot out of this process, and subsequently dismiss the progress. That is like dismissing a video camera because the quality of the still pictures it makes do not live up to those of a photo camera.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I do not mean to call your professionalism or your capabilities as a teacher into question. Neither of those things are elements that I could adequately judge online anyway, nor do I want to do these things, online or offline. I have read all of your comments on this tread, and have followed this discussion with interest. That is why I was so surprised that, what I saw as really good feedback from Jens, was not taken!</p>
<p>It seems to me that you started this thread to start the ball rolling about a discussion on a new process for designing typeface design, and how this could be a group activity. I would be interested to see a good program like this in action. However, the proof of a typeface&rsquo;s quality is not the process by which it is made, but how well it functions in its intended usage environment. A typeface doesn&rsquo;t become intrinsically better because ten or 100 people work on, as opposed to one (or however many).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned with letters, and with typefaces that work well, offering new tools to graphic designers and document makers. I want all undertaken typefaces, including the Open Baskerville project, to result in good, useful fonts. That is why I worry about trying to create a perfect system for managing collaboration without first having quality letters. To me, the resulting letterforms are more important than the process that brings them into the font. Jens sounds like a voice in the wilderness, trying to bring in the voice of good type, and his voice is not being heeded. I think that Jens&rsquo;s opinions are very important. He works with a small team of people that produce some of the highest quality fonts on the market. I suspect that he knows a lot more about good collaborative font-making processes than I do.</p>
<p>In general—and I&rsquo;ll admit that this does not have anything to do with the topic of your thread—I view the idea that the way for beginners to enter the field of type design is by joining up onto the back of a bigger project coordinated by someone else with a lot of skepticism. Aren&rsquo;t the best filmmakers the ones who as kids filmed whole movies in their basement, instead of people to try to spend decades working their way up the ladder of the industry production chain? It wasn&rsquo;t so many years ago that I drew my first letters and first fonts. I&rsquo;ve been able to watch many new designers enter our field over the past half decade or so as well… I think that he best way to learn how to make good typefaces is to start making your own letters and typefaces. Learning about typefaces by joining a big internet group font design project seems like a paradigm shift that I would not feel comfortable recommending.</p>

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’m going to address just a few of the issues mentioned above, and as some might note, skipping others blatantly. If you feel like you’d like something answered of have any otherwise specific concerns please do point them out.</p>
<p>I want to first proclaim I am myself not a type designer; I am more of a typographer but with the full intention of becoming a type designer over the coming years. I sadly have no access to tertiary type design courses at my university currently, so I am teaching myself in my spare time, as I have done thus far with most of the design-related skills that I have acquired.</p>
<p>Secondly, although not a programmer, I would consider myself affiliated with at least some part of the FOSS community, namely the Aussie network here in Down Under. I regularly attend related conferences, reside on a few IRC project channels and take part in local special interest and user groups. I’ve contributed to small number of projects over the years, namely the Tango Desktop Project and the Ubuntu Artwork team. My participation has dwindled somewhat since my starting of private work and uni, but I definitely intend to stick about and, I figured, the best way that also coincided with many of my current interests, is with a type-related project. I am entirely comfortable in not being the ‘Tzar’ regarding the Open Baskerville project; I was more keen to get a project going, even if that meant lacking a specification at commencement. There’s a common saying in the FOSS world: ‘show me the code’, and although it doesn’t apply directly, that’s what I wanted to do: get something out there that would stimulate discussion and foster interests to make additions and improvements, even if they come in small doses.</p>
<p>I’d like to tackle the understanding that small contributions from numerous contributors can’t be effectively managed or decided upon (in terms of which is the best). I’ll try to do this using an example: Rob mentioned to me that he wanted to attempt drawing the commercial at-sign (‘@’), which given the specimens we are using, isn’t featured (the character being created centuries after Fry’s Baskerville was cut). I have great respect in his enthusiasm and this bold move. I want to clarify I don’t expect ‘perfect’ glyphs or contributions (not to mention assessments are a subjective issue). The focal point here is that Rob did in fact draw a glyph that we don’t yet have which has fostered a discussion about it. We could have discussed it first, before opening our font editor, but much like the ‘show me the code’ concept, I think many of us like the idea of viewing a concept glyph, rather than trying to describe it using just words. All it takes then is for another to come along, view it and provide feedback, or if they are keen, heck, a subtle change that illustrates their opinion (and with direct access to the UFO source files, the process is made much easier!).</p>
<p>This method is not too dissimilar to that of what most of us, I think, would consider ‘professional type design’, whereby the processes of conceptualising our thoughts graphically, analysing the outcome, and making edits accordingly, through repetition leads to the steady improvement of our glyph(s). The only additional factors here are a community engagement in between these stages.</p>
<p>There is a famous saying: ‘too many cooks spoil the broth’, and rightly it applies to the FOSS methodologies too, but I believe this concern can be overcome: if there are three or four participants in a discussion over a certain glyph, start work on another, and hey, if it really comes down to it there’s still a Chief Cook who can resolve disputes and have a final word. In the case of many FOSS projects benevolent dictator (e.g. Mark Shuttleworth and the Ubuntu project) or just the most respected member of that community (or hey, even both). I think it is an erroneous judgement that any project, community or society will function without some form of conflict—it happens in our professional lives, hobbies, friendships, marriages, and yes, the free and open source world. :)</p>
<p>I believe the right to call the shots comes through respect; if I do not have the respect of my peers in a group then there are fundamental forces that will tear at the project and be in conflict of the its aims. I decided to take the initiative to launch this project because I believed just giving the metaphorical ball a push would set things in motion (and I believe it has); I would gladly pass along any sense of ownership to another who is more respected and able-bodied, and with a distributed model (via Git), this does not require a revolt and revolution.</p>
<p>This considered, even the addition of glyphs that vaguely similar stylistically to Open Baskerville project’s should I believe be valued, for they provide a starting point (thank you Ralph!). Of course some may choose to ignore these entirely; I like to draw glyphs by hand in my sketchbook first, and not edit existing glyphs to match my style; it’s up to the individual, and ultimately all work will be evaluated by the peers of the project, so even if a contribution was made that is not accurately in style of the project, it can be discussed and improved as per the aforementioned workflow.</p>
<p>Eric: I’d love to have a chat over the phone with you. I feel your thoughts and advice are of great value to this project, and if you feel up to it, would like to invite you to the lighthouse message threads and issue tracker.</p>
<p>And with that, I should mention one final thing: the issue tracker. If you do not have any desire to contribute to the project with your own glyphs or in the message threads, but feel obligated to make some thoughts heard, please feel free to add ‘tickets’ to the issue tracker. A ticket is a little note of an error (in programming often referred to as a ‘bug’), or otherwise a problem related to the font (or I guess the project as a whole). We can rate its severity, assign it to persons to be fixed or overcome and otherwise discuss it. This is a great way to leave feedback and gives us heads up on where improvements can be made.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the stimulating discussion.</p>
<p>Cheers and kind regards.</p>
<p>—Pascal</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan, I missed your post during the time that I wrote mine; I omitted my thoughts about feedback and criticism, notably from Jens (thank you by the way!). Rob has sent me a message a few days ago (actually that’s how I was made aware of this thread) and noted he has received the criticism in good spirit. I believe criticism can come across harshly and result in a depressive feeling that one’s contributions are not valued particularly in work that lacks the common monetary incentives that keep us on track, even after some critical feedback from stakeholders.</p>
<p>I too believe the best way to acquire skills or hone them is with practice. Whether this is done on a more private and individually coordinated basis is better than within a community of common-minded peers is not an easy question to answer. I believe as a student of type design Rob has a number of other excercises within the outline of his course, and his contributions are more of a side project and hobby than something upon which his final grade is assessed. I too don’t really want to go into these specifics or pull apart another’s work, professional or as part of studies as a student (being one myself), so I’ll leave it that. Cheers. (:</p>

<p>I did not &ldquo;demand&rdquo; Eric do something. A moderator smearing the intent and meaning of my words&mdash;ha-ha, I am better off laffing about that.</p>
<p>Normally we don&rsquo;t make corrections like that to the thread header &mdash; we post corrections and additional information below it in posts. Debating and discussion technique and etiquette, not Eric&rsquo;s bold formatting irritated me. I don&rsquo;t mind anybody using bold. He could have posted his additional points in the usual, customary manner, as posts, or emphasized his additions in his header with an asterisk either end of them.</p>
<p>What I find galling is Eric&rsquo;s guileless and uninformed FOSS evangelism despite his apparent lack of experience with even using fonts let alone making them. He says he&rsquo;s a conceptual artist who does installation art pieces. Come into our world and start preaching salvation thru the miracle of open source collaboration. The naivete displayed is pallid and insulting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How are your posts any different?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I get strait to the point. I was also referring to Eric&rsquo;s very lengthy posts on the &ldquo;will most likely only booster font sales&rdquo; thread, one of which is about ten times longer than any of my posts on this thread.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is an important discussion to be had, and if anyone wants to spend the time writing lengthy essays on their points of view, then by all means let them. Please stop discouraging people from posting here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I apologize if my last post scared a few peeple. I get the impression either you or Tiffany have received complaints about me being aggressive, and as usual nothing has been said to me privately. Please offer a correction if I&rsquo;m wrong about that.</p>
<p>My point was, and still is, that I don&rsquo;t have the amount of time required to read all this blather, which is going nowhere. This is so inefficient.</p>
<p>As David Berlow points out, there is still no sign of a spec. Oh boye, was that ever predictable.</p>
<p>Elvis had a hit song with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Little Less Conversation A Little More Action<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essence of my view on all this. The same peeple are still here on the same thread gassing about it, while very little progress in the way of font construction has been made.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my private group Alt Indie Typo is making steady progress. The spec for our text font superfamily is complete. Construction of variant fonts and weights is proceding without the impairment of too many cooks sitting around gassing about what to do.</p>
<p>Politics I&rsquo;m not good at. Write copy like a bastard I can. Designing typefaces I excel at.</p>

<p>Regarding design by committee, continuing on forom Eric’s note, there is still a leader who would best understand the vision, plus when dealing with a digital revival there is a specimen to compare to. It is though a valid point.</p>

<p>Yes, but what I mean with design by committee is that everyone in the project will have their own vision of the end product. They&rsquo;ll all want their own say in the process. Without a overall vision, how does this not become a hodge-podge in which everyone has stuffed their share?</p>
<p>I understand that there will be something like revisions and such, but that still doesn&rsquo;t create a unified creative vision?</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I understand that there will be something like revisions and such, but that still doesn’t create a unified creative vision?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The most easy way to see it, I guess, is that every individual type designer who starts to partake in such a design project, is from that moment on working on his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version of the font.</p>
<p>The added value of the development model is that there is a very solid collaboration system in place, that easily allows you to include the changes other designers make to the design base that you both forked from.</p>
<p>But you have full control over which changes to your design you allow.</p>
<p>That this is not really being followed in software development (as far as I know) is probably because it is not very useful in that situation, with most changes to the codebase being bug fixes.</p>
<p>The actual lines of code that make up a typeface are an order of magnitude less than those in most software programs, which make this scenario of individual project ownership IMHO much more feasible?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edt: @Quincunx: replied to your comment in the following one, thanks, E<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edt2: Oh wait, by editing that in, this one ended up being the last one. Nevermind.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>@dan_reynolds</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your reply.</p>
<p>I think our views are actually pretty similar. I will expand on this, please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems to me that you started this thread to start the ball rolling about a discussion on a new process for designing typeface design, and how this could be a group activity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Because I think you are right in that, but we do have a different take on this subject, and the difference is subtle. I think we could could state it this way: at this point I am more interested in this process than I am in the typefaces it produces, and for you it is the other way around?</p>
<p>Which makes sense, because between the two of us, you are the type designer. If we would arrive at the point where either a) these processes start producing typefaces of professional quality or b) typefaces of professional quality start to be produced with this processes—only then will our interests coincide, no?</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I do not see that happening shortly, if ever. There will IMHO always be a market for high quality typefaces conceived and executed by an individual designer with a strong typographic vision. Just as there will IMHO always  be fringes the market will not be able to cater to, and Open Source / collaborative practices will provide an alternative.</p>
<p>That is exactly why I do not think @Jens’ judgment is undervalued, or his critique is that of a lone voice in the wilderness. I do trust the capacities of these forums’ members to make these kind of judgments. Otherwise, it would have made no sense to come here. I just think his reasoning to dismiss the potential of collaboration models based on the first efforts produced by the people who just happen to be first to use them, is ill-conceived.</p>
<p>You could turn it around. Shouldn’t type designers be interested in exactly what it is, that makes visual artists, graphic designers and computer geeks band up to take the actual effort to start developing new development methods for type design? At the point where we would band up to ask type designers to give us free fonts, you can still dismiss us as cheapskates. But the fact that we are taking all this effort clearly shows that the current produce of the type industry does not meet our needs.</p>
<p>And I do not think anyone involved in these efforts would state the superiority or even the relevance of their typographic judgment as primary factors involved.</p>
<p>So why not be a bit more curious to find out what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> driving us? Ultimately, regardless of your stance in all the ideological bickering, this seems to be a very real issue among the public, who are your potential public, and ultimately your revenue stream.</p>
<p>With a similar reasoning, I am inclined to value the judgments of the forum members on the quality of letterforms higher than my own. That is why I never stated assumptions about the quality of the glyphs, because these assumptions would not be as relevant as those made by other forum members. I should have made that more clear, I think: because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->many of you seem to assume that I attribute some special quality to these glyphs that could have not come about in a traditional way, which I do not<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Finally, I also do not think this way of working shows a revelatory new approach to education in type design. At what point did I make that assertion? My educational advice to help out on a project like OpenBaskerville is not the advice I would give to a student who wants to learn how to design a typeface. In that case, I would probably be more lazy, and suggest to go and ask [[Frank E. Blokland|Frank]], [[Erik van Blokland|Erik]], [[Just van Rossum|Just]] or [[Peter Verheul|Peter]] about that.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I think @Klepas, @Rob and me are primarily interested in, is the way in which certain practices first found in the Open Source movement, can inform the traditional practice of individual cultural production; which has more to do with communication between people, than it has to with letterforms.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But just for the record, of course I see the importance of quality letterforms in any type related project. For the other record, I will try and refute @Jens’ reasoning in a subsequent comment.</p>
<p>But with regards to the letterforms: I did not focus on the quality of the glyphs because I am neither drawing them, nor do I have any special expertise on this matter. But @Rob did notice, and he did take it seriously. Within an hour after @Jens‘ comments, the following commits appeared in the project tree:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But to clarify on the people-remark, these are some of the points I find exciting:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Digital collaboration has enabled me to discuss the area where my very specific interests converged with the very specific interests of others, right here on this thread<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The kind of exchange this forum facilitates, as inherently linked to recent technological development. And although it is not tagged as Open Source, it does possess a lot of qualities that can be attributed to Open Source, and for much the same reasons.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why these enhancements work, is not so much because of a striking new model for communication, but because of the way it greatly widens the scope of our traditional analogue ways of working together.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My collaboration with @Rob is pretty traditional, in the sense that we met in real life, we meet in real life, and we employ the time-tested social model of tutor and pupil.** At the same time, in our seperate ways we are both contributing to a project of @Klepas, who lives in Australia. The most striking thing is, IMHO, that before @Klepas’ post above, I had never had any contact with him, either digital or analog, yet I have been able to contribute to his project to the extent that he just publicly thanked me for it. Now, If @Klepas would have also lived a 10 minute walk away, we would probably have met in real life, and chances are a similar collaboration would have come about. It is the fact the doesn’t, but that new technology makes us work together like he does, that is exciting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The traditional top-down model of the author does not hold as a frame of reference for these kinds of practices<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To react to two points in your last comment: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that there is still one big unresolved problem: the letters that Jens points out are not good enough for this typeface. Where in your process is the voice that makes that decision and tells the ’author’ that?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That is the whole point I was trying to make about the relevance of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->distributed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> authorship (which @Klepas also pointed at in his lasts comments). Distributed authorship makes sure that nobody who knows what he is doing can be ignored. If you or @Jens or @Merkri feel there are obvious flaws in the font, it is trivial to make your own fork, and fix the flaws in the way you see fit (trivial in a social and conceptual way, not yet in a technological way, but IMHO the latter is also bound to happen).</p>
<p>In a distributed model anyone has a full version of the repository, and at that point you have cloned your own you are just as much the ‘Author’ of the project as the maintainer of the original repository.</p>
<p>In a distributed model, you can just clone a project and start tinkering away, and let the question whether you would like to contribute back to the originating project be one of later concern. In fact, if your modifications are good enough, at some point the originating project will start pulling from you!</p>
<p>I agree with @Klepas’ statement: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe the right to call the shots comes through respect;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would gladly pass along any sense of ownership to another who is more respected and able-bodied<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In a distributed model, it is not as much the notion of the author that is being contested, it is the notion of ownership. Because in each fork of the project, the maintainer is the Tzar, and has all the opportunity to make the project confirm to his unique vision.</p>
<p>So the way this works: as long as we respect the Tzar we will listen to him. But when we do not respect the Tzar any longer, we do not kill him, we just clone his palace and start redecorating! That is why I feel any critique on the typeface at this point is not very relevant: we are evaluating a model where nobody is stopping you from jumping in, and creating your own version that exemplifies your critique in a solid way: letters.</p>
<p>**Just to make that clear, @Rob does not study type design, he studies graphic design. And he is not directly one of my students in the sense that he partakes in my classes, rather I coach his Individual Study Trajectory which is a part of the curriculum every student has to fill with self-initiated projects.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS why this time really ‘nobody is stopping you from jumping in’.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now that is something FOSS has been clamouring all along, but IMHO it is only when project ownership becomes distributed, that the open source development process starts to get relevant for cultural production. Because a traditional open source software development process is built around a package that should meet the needs and tastes of a certain community.</p>
<p>IMHO, for cultural producers looking to get involved, this approach has two drawbacks. The first one has most widely been noted here, with most of us convinced of the need for individual vision.</p>
<p>The second one is less apparent, but equally valid: because projects are so closely tied to communities, it becomes very hard for an outsider to make his voice heard. In the first place, because you have to adapt to the communication processes of that community. That can be hard enough: how are you going to ‘seek help in an IRC channel’ if you do not know what an IRC channel is? But more importantly, your chances of being listened to are inversely related to the extent to which you share the frame of reference of that community. The approach stimulates the banding together of peer groups, which they should not need to do since they are peers already anyway. Any banding together will just stimulate their drive for consensus, and take away from their drive for creative, intellectual or conceptual curiosity.</p>

<p>Nonsense.
The world loves the fonts we&rsquo;re making.
Type is popping up all over the place, a culturally relevant form of expression&ndash;which stands to reason, as typography is at the edge of technology, and has been taken to the massive by digitization.
So it&rsquo;s understandable that open source ideologues feel they should address the issue and exercise some hegemony.
Fonts are software, apparently.
It&rsquo;s a power play. You&rsquo;re not really interested in typefaces at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just a quick note, as I&rsquo;m very busy this week (including flying to The Hague tomorrow) and don&rsquo;t have the time to answer in detail &hellip;</p>
<p>First a big thank-you to Dan, you explained the point I was trying to make better than I probably ever could :)</p>
<p>Secondly, I apologize if my criticism came across as being harsh or dismissive of the whole approach, that wasn&rsquo;t my intention. Perhaps I can put it this way: As they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating (to paraphrase Dan), by which I mean that I think a lot more interest in the collaborative project could be generated if the outcome was something really useful. I&rsquo;m not really seeing the gap that could be filled with (another) version of Fry&rsquo;s Baskerville.</p>
<p>Re. my &ldquo;do something original instead&rdquo;:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far more involved in the technical side of font production than in the aesthetic side, I had no formal training in type design, which doesn&rsquo;t keep me from trying to improve my drawing skills (working at a foundry and getting to see tons of typefaces certainly helps :) &hellip;</p>
<p>From my own experience I think it&rsquo;s easier for a beginner not to work on someone else&rsquo;s design, because if a beginner is good he will know his limits and work inside them. If he works on somebody else&rsquo;s design, and no detailed specs to follow exists, he can never be sure to miss some parameter or decision made by the original designer that may be obvious to someone more experienced.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s better to aim for a solid, useful, if a bit low-profile result than to fail at an overly ambitious project.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t come at me with that kind of pernicious nonsense. As usual you have failed completely in your duty of care as a moderator. You should have flagged my vitriolic response to Eric as vitriol and extracted and apology from me, but instead you used smear tactics.</p>
<p>Do a word count of his posts versus mine and then you can believe your eyes when you compare both our posts and the word count stats.</p>
<p>The politics going on here are very clear to the outside world. In the world outside Typophile, Typophiles have one of the worst reputations known to the internet.</p>
<p>I am currently interviewing an applicant for the position of publicist for Alt Indie Typo. The applicant has this to say about Typophile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve grown to be pretty tough skinned in my professional forays as I
have developed enough experience and ability to justify my creative
decisions within the fields I have chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That said, Typophile petrifies me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After having read the vitriolic and scathing attacks on people at
Typophile, I am now thinking that it might have more sociable to have
been a peg-legged pirate with a personal vendetta from the King of
England on his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Typophile is far more brutal than those ultimate fighting championships
seen on television.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric, to make my view of you and this thread and the shit that goes on at Typophile very clear, you&rsquo;re not fooling anybody except yourself and the guileless fools pandering to your nonsense.</p>
<p>Anybody who wants to challenge what I am saying this time around had best avoid personally attacking me and each other. Only rational arguments about the topic of discussion based on fact and knowledge gained from practical experience with type design and fonts are acceptable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@sii: Hey, it was only that one time, and&hellip; oh, you said Yankees fan. I don&rsquo;t really follow sports, good thing that.</p>
<p>Generally I find typophile to be one of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better<!-- raw HTML omitted --> places on the Internet. For one, Godwin&rsquo;s law seems suspended here. With few exceptions, every time Hitler or the Nazis comes up, what follows is an entirely civil discussion of blackletter, to what extent Futura was</p>
<p>Having risked Godwinning this thread myself, I also want to contribute to the substantive issues (while carefully avoiding vitriol and trolling). I personally think that copying old, well-done fonts can be a good educational experience. I think of it as being fairly analogous to copying old masters, which is, from what I can tell, still a fairly respected method in art instruction.</p>
<p>I feel like I learned a lot about the technical aspects of letters from my tracings of old alphabets. My early stuff (LeBe) wasn&rsquo;t that good, but, with practice I got better at it. I&rsquo;d hold up my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Baskerville Italic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zeno<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tracings as among the most accurate ever made from metal type (warning: the latter file has some bogus hinting, which makes the baseline ragged; print to appreciate properly). Not to mention, I learned a lot about optical scaling, which almost all metal type gets right and very little digital. That experience with tracing has given me a lot more confidence doing my own original designs.</p>
<p>I think the letter grade idea that Nick suggested has potential, but it depends on good teachers willing to participate. If that looks at all like Typophile&rsquo;s critique boards, it could be a rousing success. I&rsquo;m amazed to see the way a typeface gradually evolves and becomes more beautiful as the designer subjects it to critique and refines it - the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cursive Flavored Sans<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a striking example, imho.</p>
<p>There is a community, and it is here. I hope acrimonious discussions like this thread don&rsquo;t poison things, especially for F/OSS projects. It certainly has helped remind me of why not taking on building a collaborative design forum myself was a good idea.</p>
