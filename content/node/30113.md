    not into the Christian part of xmas or any of the hype, but I try hard to live
    by these principals. <em>\"Human is\"</em> --- to forgive, to empathize and have
    compassion for others, no matter what you believe personally.\r\n\r\nIn other
    words, it's okay to differ---diversity is strength & richness in any community---as
    long as after all is said and done we can put aside our ideology and be human,
    forgive each other's errors and faults, and try to see each other's point of view.\r\n\r\nThat's
    not hiding behind a veil of relativism, but an explanation of empathy.\r\n\r\nWishing
    all typophiles the very best.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    my best wishes for the festive season. Keep the spirit of joy alive in your heart
    Claudio, and go on doing what you do best. Go with what makes sense to you and
    don't let anyone else, least of all me, tell you what to do or what to believe.\r\n\r\nKind
    & warm regards,\r\nj a m e s"
