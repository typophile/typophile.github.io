  body: Hkrrm.. my fault! <BR> <BR>Perhaps I should mention that I was refering to
    the sharpness of web-headlines - jpgs or gif! <BR> <BR>Look here for instance
    <a href="http://www.modern.dk/" target="_blank">http://www.modern.dk/</a> <BR>The
    text-graphics are so clear and strong! <BR> <BR>Thanks again, <BR>/henriko

  body: 'the graphics you&#39;re admiring are in .png file format - a lossless web
    compression; i&#39;m guessing that&#39;s why the text looks so good on the web.

  body: Hey Andrea, <BR>It&#39;s not quite what I&#39;m looking for... <BR> <BR>I
    would like to render the text in Photoshop - the compression is a different thing
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried different render-options in the text-palette but it&#39;s
    not really computing...  <BR> <BR>/henriko

  body: You&#39;ll never get sharp text in photoshop. You&#39;ll never get sharp downsamples
    on images either. Try Macromedia&#39;s fireworks. The kearning really sucks, but
    the type is very crisp &#40;the image downsamples too, for that matter&#41;. Photoshop
    just wasn&#39;t designed with 72 dpi in mind.

  body: You could use &#39;crisp&#39; instead of  &#39;smooth&#39; that would help
    a bit.
