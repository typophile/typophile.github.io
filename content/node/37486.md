body: "I'm looking for fonts suitable for use in my master's thesis, which will deal
  with the computerizing of an Aleut-English dictionary.  Modern Aleut orthography
  has only two tricky characters, g with a circumflex and x with a circumflex.  However,
  I anticipate needing to include several sample entries from the dictionary, and
  the dictionary uses a plethora of accented or otherwise special characters, some
  of which are only supported in Unicode via combining diacritics.  So criterion number
  one is to find a font that supports (most of) the characters I need.\r\n\r\nCriterion
  number two is that it have bold and italic variants.  Small caps sure would be nice,
  as would the complete International Phonetic Alphabet.\r\n\r\nThere are a handful
  of free fonts that meet criteria one and two; the best one I have so far is Charis
  SIL.  I've also looked at Doulos SIL, Aboriginal Serif and Aboriginal Sans (from
  languagegeek.com), Junicode and Linux Libertine.  In the absence of anything better,
  I'm really glad to have these fonts, but I wonder if anybody knows of some other
  (more professional) options.  Ideally I'd like to have a sans-serif font and a serif
  font that complement each other; it seems to be popular in lexicographic typesetting
  to have a bold sans-serif font for headwords and source-language material and a
  serif font for most of the other stuff.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a file showing the
  characters used in the dictionary.  If anyone knows of fonts that might fit the
  bill, I'd love to hear about them.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAric"

    thread after about a week and didn't realize anyone had responded.  Thanks for
    all the input!\r\n\r\nMichel, I use LaTeX regularly but I haven't used Computer
    Modern in years.  I guess I forgot about it.  It's not my favorite font family,
    but now that you mention it I'm sure it covers the bases.  Thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nPaul,
    thanks for the pointers.  Fedra is an impressive family.\r\n\r\nPaul and Simon,
    custom modifications to a font sounds wonderful but also pricey, especially for
    a starving student trying to support a family of four.  What's the going rate
    for, say, a dozen new characters and four combining diacritics tuned to seven
    specific base+diacritic combinations?"

    in years.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe same is true with me; I mainly use pdflatex with utopia.
    However, the sans serif CMU Bright should in my opinion not be overlooked. <a
    href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/CMUbright-vs-Myriad.pdf\"><strong>Here</strong></a>
    is a parallel between CMU Bright and Myriad Pro, that I made to get a feeling
    of how both handle diacritics. \r\n\r\n> <cite>custom modifications to a font
    sounds wonderful but also pricey</cite>\r\n\r\nIt is my feeling that you could
    do that yourself. Copying two letters, shrinking them to 65% horizontally and
    55% vertically, moving them up and fixing the sidebearings is in my opinion no
    big deal. Moving around a few diacritics is (still in my opinion) closer to editing
    than to font design. I am certainly no font designer but that's the kind of thing
    I can do (as well as adding a custom GSUB table to get the character variants
    I want). One problem with CMU Bright is that it is not class kerned and so, if
    you add a \"ligature\" x_hat, you cannot add it to the same left and right kerning
    class as x, but I think that's a minor problem.\r\n\r\nMichel"
