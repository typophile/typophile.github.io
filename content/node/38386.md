body: "Is the slab serif font of the old logotype for <a href=\"http://www.friedrich.com/\">Friedrich
  Air Conditioning Co.</a> custom made? It reminds me a bit of Beton, Stymie and in
  part Peter Bruhns Farao. The closest I've found so far is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/clarity-aoe/\">Clarity</a>
  by Astigmatic but that's no match. \r\n\r\nAnyone got a clue?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Friedrich_4833.jpg]\r\n"
