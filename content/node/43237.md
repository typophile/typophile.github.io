body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI've been working on a logo for a church as a freelance gig for
  the last couple of months. I've gone through several revisions with them, and have
  narrowed the logo down to a finalist. I think the chosen logo fits the church; it's
  modern enough to appeal to the local suburban community, but doesn't completely
  do away with tradition either.\r\n\r\nI'm at the point where it's time for final
  tweaks. This is always easier said then done. I'm still reletively fresh out of
  school, so I'm still somewhat inexperienced in completely finalizing my concepts.\r\n\r\nAny
  help or advice would be very appreciated, especially for the symbol.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMichael"

    the church, it doesn't feel like they need each other at all. I think you nailed
    the target, though.\r\n\r\n(I can't help but think of the \"Happy Hands Club\"
    in Napoleon Dynamite :)"

  body: "This is great.  Any time you can design a logo for a church where the client
    doesn't demand a cross is a success.  (I designed a logo for the church I work
    for, and everyone flipped when I even suggested not using a cross.  Then I recently
    used it in an application and was told it wasn't \"Christian\" enough ... I really
    can't win with these folks, but I've already said too much about my own problems.)\r\n\r\nThe
    only issue I have is that I also see hands first, and then the dove.  Is there
    any way you can make the hands a bit more subtle so that the dove is more dominant?
    \ (Maybe have the hands overlap so they're not so discrete.)  The former definitely
    has a \"happy hands\" feel to it, and then one says, \"Oh, but it's also a dove.\"
    \ I imagine saying, \"Oh, a dove ... but it's also hands - neat!\" would be a
    better response.  Overall, though, it's very nice.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Their last logo incorporated a dove, so most people I've talked to from the
    church see the dove first. Great to get more opinions though.\r\n\r\nHilarious,
    I didn't realize the similarity to the \u2018happy hands club\u2019. I've only
    seen Napoleon Dynamite once though.\r\n"
