  Typography.\r\n\r\nI have a project coming up in Doha where bilingual signage will

  \ What are good font's to use?  How to kern Arabic type?  General rules of thumb?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHB"

  body: "Hi,\r\nI would recommend a few things:\r\n. decide in the first step on the
    hierarchy (which is more important or are they equal?)\r\n. regarding kerning,
    the typeface will have that in it; if you meant tracking so as to space it out,
    you can insert kashidas (horizontal strips) but the place where you can add them
    depends on the words themselves.\r\n. I find it much better if the Arabic is on
    top of the Latin or on its left\r\n(if you look at the icon of my Frutiger Arabic
    you'll see what I mean)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps :)\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nNadine\r\n"

  body: "Whatever you do, don't try to make the two scripts appear comparable in size.
    Sure, you shouldn't exacerbate the issue by using a Latin font with a huge x-height
    and/or a particularly delicate Arabic font, but the two scripts use the Cartesian
    area very differently, so if you think you've managed to make the Arabic appear
    almost as large as the Latin, that means you've probably ruined the Arabic.  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    measurable (ie and equivalent to x-height or cap-height)? '

  body: "That's the thing, there's nothing like an x-height (and trying to force one
    has been the undoing of countless \"Latin-matching\" efforts). Furthermore, the
    ascenders and descenders don't always end horizontally. You really have to eyeball
    it. And to help things along you should allow the Arabic to take up more vertical
    space than the Latin, and maybe even allow it a darker weight than the Latin.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Try to balance the visual weight of the two scripts, rather than height or
    other proportions. In the case of something like signage, you may find that this
    means using different relative sizes at different scales, and dependent also on
    the text. This sort of thing often freaks out signage designers, because they
    tend to like grids and want to be able to spec sizes that can be applied across
    a system to arbitrary texts. But if you are working with a small amount of known
    text, then it is easier to work in this way (similar to the way in which a stonecutter
    or calligrapher will lay out and balance a design).

    harmonizing few *abvious* ascenders and descenders would be very sufficient for
    balancing the two.\r\n\r\n-Saad  \r\n\r\n"

    \ We like measurements we can check against tables to measure reading distances

    to give the two equal weight\r\n\r\nOften the French was done in a monoline (or
    close enough to one).  The Arabic had a much larger height, but resulted in the
    horizontal stroke of the Arabic to be actually slight thinner in general than
    the thickness of the Latin strokes.  I thought it was odd but it matched okay.
