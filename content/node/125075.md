body: "Hello, I've often used Myriad for my clients as a title and copy font, because
  of its 'neutrality' and elegance. The black and light version are incredibly well
  done, and the regular version fits almost every use. In zen tongue some might say
  it has a transparent quality. \r\nBut it's getting old. I'd like to try out something
  different. Immediate use would be for the printed things of a school of English
  in Europe. Any suggestion is welcome. \r\nThanks!\r\n"

    of my favourite fonts lately. It's very well done, not as versatile s Myriad but
    very beautiful.

      you are prepared to pontificate your subjective opinion? Personally, I would
      have opted to simply ask questions, such as: (a) what technical capabilities
      does your client need... meaning, do you need a font which includes built-in
      superscripts/subscripts/numrs/denoms/smallcaps, etc... (b) is this for more
      technical copy, informational copy, etc... (c) how diverse of weights do you
      need (hairline to heavy, or just the basic reg/ital/bold/boldital)? Aren''t
      these types of questions more helpful to the person asking the question, rather
      than "not a good idea to use a neutral font" straight out of the gun?'

    feels a little more contemporary than Myriad. It splits the difference nicely
    between a humanist and a grotesque.

  body: Michael, it's exactly that defaulting to a typeface does not ask such vital
    questions about a client. And I did not see Massimo mention a client, but simply
    express the desire to find a new default... Neutrality is illusory, and having
    a narrow set of fonts for use on whatever project comes one's way is something
    Vignelli would do. When it comes to grasping the power of typography, that's not
    a compliment.

  body: Hrant, if that is the case, then, why not express your subjective opinions
    as opinions and not as constructive assistance. Sometimes, people do not even
    know how to ask the right questions... maybe it is someone who is tapped on the
    shoulder and told to manage the school publication, and they know little of typography.
    I have to observe that Vignelli represented a "movement" of thought... although
    I may have personal disagreements with the school of 10-12 types, as a moral philosopher,
    I am duty-bound to understand that others may find some element of truth in any
    school of thought. If you are committed to any specific school of thought, then
    morally, you have the duty to state the fact that you subscribe to a specific
    school of thought (I hope you can logically see that to subscribe to any specific
    school of thought is delusion). Neutrality is a word that means different things
    to different people. Perhaps the original question referred to a desire to pick
    a type that did not take the reader's focus away from the text... you would agree
    that choosing Ayita for a school workhorse type would be a bit over the line,
    as opposed to a "neutral" workhorse sans such as FF Clan or Secca... in short,
    we have a collective responsibility to "listen" rather than show others how much
    we think we know...

  body: "I do believe in listening and communicating. I was trying to be succinct,
    but maybe it came off as too dismissive. A \"default\" typeface choice is just
    such a common and damaging trait among many designers that it's hard for me to
    remain tentative about combating it. Although I don't believe in subscribing to
    a formal school of thought, I can say that every font says something, and there
    are so many fonts out there it's almost guaranteed that something like Myriad
    (especially something so over-used) will not be the best choice. For anybody who
    can't justify the expense of getting just the right font for a project, that's
    an understandable compromise that nonetheless should be admitted as such.\r\n\r\nYour
    definition of \"neutral\" is pretty much mine as well, but it simply varies too
    much with time and among people to be anything more than a misleading dream. When
    it comes to the power of type, Vignelli simply did not grasp it. It's almost like
    he was an artist who didn't want to give credit to the quietly ever-present type
    designers; to me trying to remove a typeface's particular voice from a typographic
    composition is irrational."

    :)\r\n\r\nI interpret the term neutral as 'suitable for a wide range of purposes'.
    It's not that a neutral typeface communicates neutrality, but that it doesn't
    communicate anything overly specific, and so can be used in a lot of different
    contexts without fear of it being stylistically at odds with the content or the
    context. There are lots of situations in which this sort of neutrality is desirable
    \u2014 more so today, when type is used to display dynamic content coming from
    online feeds, messaging, etc. \u2014, and having a go-to neutral typeface isn't
    a bad thing for a typographer to have on hand, any more than having more strongly
    voiced typefaces for specific purposes. The point of having a go-to typeface in
    any style is that one is familiar with how to use it, which is a virtue often
    overlooked in typography today."
