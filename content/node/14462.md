  body: "Although SOTA and TypeCon would love to take credit for coming up with the
    Typophile Film Festival, this is Jared and Joe's brainchild. We are just happy
    as can be to give them a venue for the festival, and to help promote it. So it's
    not the TypeCon Film Festival, but the Typophile Film Festival, produced by Punchcut.
    Which debuts at TypeCon...\r\n\r\nWhew. So now, if only Jared and Joe didn't have
    to run Punchcut and Typophile and have families, and were rich, oh, and didn't
    have to get permission from copyright holders, they could get that DVD out ;)\r\n\r\nOne
    of these days... and it will be worth the wait!"

    has a short report, it also has links to some of the films available to view in
    Quicktime\r\nEtched in Stone and Little Yellow Writing Hood are well worth viewing.\r\nTim"
