  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Upcoming days, I&rsquo;ll be working on the design of a dissertation. A friend of mine is becoming a real doctor. In these collection of scientific articles, which, all together, form the body of the dissertation, lots &amp; lots of abbrevations are used, in various kinds. For example:</p>
<p>protein S, protein A, type III, PS antigen, VTE, ATE, acronyms like &lsquo;DESCARTES&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s all mambojambo, but I wanted to be clear and straightforward and set all these abbrevations in (spaced) small caps.
That&rsquo;s quite a tough job of typographic handwork but I think it&rsquo;s necessary, or at least the best solution.</p>
<p>Am I right with this?</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not about ugliness of capitals. It&rsquo;s about the beauty and usefulness of small caps. NOT to use small caps in the cases I listed in my first post, would be just a decision because of professional conventions, not aesthetics.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s another point. My view on typography can be rather black&amp;white. That is to say: if I set the S of &ldquo;protein S&rdquo; in regular capital, hence I do the same with the C in &ldquo;protein C&rdquo;. Off course. But then, why would I use small caps in any case? Setting, for example, DESCARTES in small caps and leaving the roman numerals for what they are, isn&rsquo;t that just an unmotivated, arbitrary choice?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t I better skip the whole concept of small caps, in order to be consistent and logical? Or does that way of thinking lack a certain typographic flexibility?</p>

<p>You use them when they (1) serve a purpose, and (2) are not contraindicated. We can squabble over particular instances, but should be able to agree on the principle. In passing, the purpose they serve is not &ldquo;obeying a rule,&rdquo; or &ldquo;banishing ugliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid book interior design is really a trade, not an art. It can occasionally be a craft, but those who forget the use of a book interior; the requirement of service to author and reader, are not doing their job.</p>

<p>The problem with full cap acronyms is that they alter the visual color of the page. Like bold type, or lining numerals, they make little blobs of heavy ink usage on the page. These can impede reading &hellip; the eye is drawn to the heavy area, breaking away from where it was, and then must fight its way back.</p>
<p>That is the real reason why typographers use small cap acronyms, old style figures, and italic instead of bold for emphasis, with the exception of books designed to make the eye jump to certain locations (dictionaries and key words in a textbook, as examples).</p>
<p>Some people say they use them because they like the look of them, or that they are different. For me that isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>A single letter in full caps is not a problem, except that of consistency. I always had problems with US when dealing in small caps, as it looks like the word us went set in SC. I always tried to get editor&rsquo;s permission to use USA instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just reacting to a trend I sense. After a period (phototype and early digital) when small caps were practically non-existent and sorely missed, suddenly now the pendulum seems to have swung the other way.</p>
<p>Seems like everyone wants to apply small caps whenever capitals are removed from lowercase. Small caps have become some badge of typographic sophistication, and who doesn&rsquo;t want to be sophisticated? The more you use, the more sophisticated you are, right?</p>
<p><cite> &gt; Setting, for example, DESCARTES in small caps and leaving the roman numerals for what they are, isn’t that just an unmotivated, arbitrary choice?</cite></p>
<p>I suppose one might think so. But if setting a long acronym in small caps, in order to prevent a dark reading distraction in the text, causes one to also set roman numerals in small caps, wherein they become momentarily confusing to the reader and unclear as roman numerals . . .  then I would suggest that (paraphrasing Emerson) &ldquo;a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little caps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m quite aware of the problem. Small caps aren&rsquo;t the only solution and not always the most appropriate. As I suggested, adding some extra air can also be effective. I think we can agree that even color is the common goal.</p>
<p>I have no objection to small caps in general. Hell, I use them all the time myself. What I&rsquo;m [over] reacting to is an unexamined notion that &ldquo;Two or More Caps Together&rdquo; in text automatically signals &ldquo;Use Small Caps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interesting observation. My experience (back to 1980 anyway) runs the other way, in phototype setting times, designer&rsquo;s dealing with extended text would choose a font that had small caps available. Sort of an extension of the thinking from hot metal; most type shops would have four or five or even six type families appropriate for setting extended text, and the designer would choose from those.</p>
<p>I suppose advertising design and composition might have been different.</p>
<p>Which maybe points up the range of responses in this thread. Type designers tend to think in theoretical terms, where the only theory at play is typographic theory.</p>
<p>Type users split into at least two groups. One is broadly termed ephemeral printing, where the display type may be most important and chosen first. Usually the amount of text is so small that manipulation of characters or their setting is not a problem. Another group would be book typography, which has different expectations about a reader (including how many hours he/she has to spend with the text). I suppose today another would be the use of type on the web, and for all I know, that breaks into multiple uses as well.</p>
<p>Sounding my overused trumpet yet again, The purpose of almost all type is for communication, usually in the form of reading, not hanging on a museum wall. Once you agree on that point, how you view an audience becomes a key concept. And how the (graphic) designer treats that audience is equally key; rarely is it correct for the designer to further their agenda. To do so moves you back toward &ldquo;audience&rdquo; in an artistic context; a work hanging on a museum wall.</p>

<p>In phototype setting times (no small caps available) it was common to set full cap acronyms half a point smaller.</p>

<p>What system allowed half point increments? My memory is that the old photosetting units had fixed point sizes, like 9, 10, 12, 14, etc.</p>

<p>Well, fonts were proprietary to the composing machine in photocomp days, but most Linotype photocomp machines (and I&rsquo;d guess Monotype) had small capitals in both Bembo and Stempel Garamond.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">An engineer&rsquo;s viewpoint:
 “BASIC&quot; and &ldquo;UNIX&rdquo; should be small-caps.  But you can&rsquo;t do that with &ldquo;C&rdquo;, so &ldquo;C++&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;C#&rdquo; also need full caps.  Make sure the operators in “C++” fit nicely; I&rsquo;ve seen too many fonts (<em>e.g.</em>, Georgia as used on this site) where the `+' marks were too high or low.  And although the language is officially called &ldquo;C#&rdquo;, do check if &ldquo;C♯&rdquo; might look better.
