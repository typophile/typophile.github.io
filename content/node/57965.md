  body: "Hi Eduardo,\r\n\r\nThis is amazing, it's a great work. One of my favorite
    letter is \"t\", and \"w\" is lovely too. Well, I love almost everything.\r\n\r\nThe
    crashing beak of the \"s\" is a little bit disturbing for me. I suggest also to
    release the gutter of the \"r\", it looks very condensed. The upper join of \"d\"
    is too wide comparing with \"b\" or \"g\".\r\n\r\nI think some straight terminals
    of the uppercase letters should be replaced by the \"A\" right terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSergio"

  body: "many, many beautiful glyphs\r\nlove the j, k, q, z, 9, B especially\r\nq's
    a little hard to read but I find it so appealing that I don't mind!\r\n\r\nspine
    of S looks weak\r\nagree about crashing on s; Y too\r\nagree about r - appreciate
    that you don't want to open up too much space underneath, but the arm looks a
    bit like a squooshed ellipse.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the angles are a touch too sharp
    - the humps at x-height (bhmnp) and the flicks at the baseline (adhilmntu). Of
    course you don't want to make it too sloppy, but letters with those angles stand
    out a bit against letters without them to my eye."
