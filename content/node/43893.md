body: "Hi there. I've got an mri scan, and I'm looking to emulate the typeface on
  it. I've attached a sample to the post.\r\nAny thoughts? I especially lke the clunky
  8-bitiness of the upper A and S. Obviously a lot of the character comes from the
  distortion due to how the image is put on the film, but I can work with that once
  I get a reasonably close face selected.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\nSam\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MRI-2_5893.jpg]"
