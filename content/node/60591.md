body: "The Vorticists published the literary magazine BLAST, which Lewis edited. It
  contained work by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot as well as by the Vorticists themselves.
  Its typographical adventurousness was cited by El Lissitzky as one of the major
  forerunners of the revolution in graphic design in the 1920s and 1930s.\r\n\r\n\r\nshould
  you have the opportunity to access a copy I highly recommend it. I was just given
  a reproduced version to scan and its given me fresh ideas, v.inspiring.\r\n\r\n"
