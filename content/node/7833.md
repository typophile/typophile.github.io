body: Does InDesign CS have any way of generating impositions? If not, what is a straightforward
  program that does? Mac only, please.

  body: A &#34;light&#34; version of the InBooklet plug-in comes with InDesign CS
    and does fairly basic impositioning. If that doesn&#39;t do what you need, check
    out the full version of InBooklet. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Outside of InDesign, but still on the Mac, is <a href="http://www.iconus.ch/fabien/cocoabooklet/">CocoaBooklet</a>,
    which allows you to do imposition with any PDF file.
