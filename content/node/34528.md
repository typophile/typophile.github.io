  body: "Nice. I love it!\r\nOnly thing that comes to mind right now is the 'd'. It
    might be a little bit less 'flipped b'. It is standing out now in the Regular
    face. \r\nThe alternate 'd' is already better, although I think it is the bowl
    that is standing out for me on the 'd'.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, very nice work."

  body: "I don't think that \"s\" in stylistic alternates & italic is readable...
    I'm constantly confusing it with \"b\". Also \"l\" in stylistic alternates look
    like the only letter with very thin stroke. I like it a lot. But maybe you should
    populate that on some other letters too.\r\n\r\nAll in all: I like the typeface."

    italic version. Those do not have the same problem as the regular ones have."
