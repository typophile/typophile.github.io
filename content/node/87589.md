  which provide properly constructed glyphs. So far, beyond the basic system fonts,
  I've really been limited to Gentium. As I want to make sure these characters are

    but don't think I kept them. I made up some of the needed characters in a different
    font for the University of New Mexico press to set a book. Things wound up where
    a U.N. representative looked the characters over & both said they were OK and
    pleaded for more fonts with the correct characters. But nobody ever took things
    further. I'm sure your work will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nOne thing I do remember
    was some wanted the underdot a dot, some wanted a bar. There was a compromise,
    where a bar with rounded corners was used. I think that got changed; I imagine
    the shapes of things are undergoing a certain standardization.\r\n\r\n"

    in to. \r\n\r\nSome of this information I'm looking for would be, for example,
    whether the Capital Latin Gamma (uni0194) should extend below the baseline (as
    I've seen it drawn both ways). I suppose the best method would be to go directly
    to the source."

  body: "<strong>JamesT,</strong>\r\n\r\nin order to define the language support for
    [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|my own font]], I did a research about alphabets
    using Latin script last year. I can send you some material about African languages,
    if you want. It is far from a comprehensive relation, but may prove useful.\r\n\r\nBesides
    this, there are some good sources of information on the web:\r\n[[http://www.panafril10n.org/wikidoc/pmwiki.php/PanAfrLoc/Zande|PanAfrican]]\r\n[[http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&id=|ScriptSource]]\r\n[[http://www.geonames.de/index.html|Geonames]]\r\n[[http://www.sil.org/|SIL

    and N with hook]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/73886|K with hook and others]]\r\n\r\nI
    also read Wikipedia pages for all documented African languages and also all pages
    for the base character letters, which link to unsuspect diacritical combinations.
    Note sometimes the English Wikipedia page for a given language may be not the
    more informative one.\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>John Hudson,</strong>\r\n\r\nas usual,
    you kindly help us a lot with your deep knowledge. I was unaware about the pan-African
    support provided by Ebrima.\r\n\r\nHow could I get more info about the languages
    targeted by Ebrima? I saw the font have precomposed vowel+ogonek and vowel+cedilla
    to all vowels. I cannot find most of these combinations in the research I did
    and would like to know about the languages actually using them.\r\n\r\nBesides
    this, some African combinations were not included in Ebrima, as Open O with dieresis
    (used in Dinka) or W with hook (used in Puguli). So I believe Ebrima development
    narrowed the language support according to some criteria to avoid the massive
    combinations one find in SIL fonts or African Serif.\r\n\r\nAny info on this will
    be very welcome."

  body: "Igor, when I was researching African languages in the late 1990s, I spent
    a week at the African Studies library at Northwestern University. While there,
    I noted the instability of many orthographies, and inconsistency in the use of
    diacritics. Sometimes this inconsistency seemed to reflect either particular mechanisms
    of text production, i.e. what characters were available on a particular typewriter,
    and sometimes the influence of colonial languages or the native language of linguists/missionaries
    involved in alphabet development. So one of the things I noted was that nasalisation
    -- which is an optional feature of many African orthographies -- was sometimes
    indicated with a tilde above the vowel, sometimes with an ogonek, and sometimes
    with a cedilla. I believe the latter is really a variant of the ogonek resulting
    from the presence of the cedilla on French typewriters. I suspect as orthographies
    become stabilised, some of this variation is likely to disappear, but my recommendation
    to Microsoft for Ebrima was to support the variants I had documented in my earlier
    research for them.\r\n\r\nThe open o with dieresis should be supported in Ebrima
    with mark positioning for the combining dieresis character. Precomposed diacritics
    are only used in Ebrima if they were either encoded as such in Unicode, or involved
    merging of outline (as in the case of the letters with ogonek etc.). A huge number
    of additional diacritics are supportable with mark positioning.\r\n\r\nThe Puguli
    alphabet is pretty new, and I'm not sure it was even defined when I was conducting
    research on African languages. If they're using the w with hook, then that should
    be added to Ebrima."

  body: "John Hudson,\r\n\r\nAfter studying Ebrima for a while, I've found the logic
    for the specific glyph inclusion very interesting and helpful in regards to directing
    my own research. \r\n\r\nRegarding the Open O with dieresis (and the open E with
    dieresis), they do appear composed on my PC (both upper and lower case). The only
    issue is the Uppercase glyph uses the lowercase combining accent, resulting in
    a difficult-to-decode glyph.\r\n\r\nI used to live right outside of Northwestern,

    better support for AAT, but we're removed those in the version that will come
    out next year.\r\n\r\nAs for the Capital Latin Gamma (uni0194), we choose to keep

    historical note, the Practical Orthography for African Languages (POAL) from 1927/1930,
    which influenced many alphabets of West Africa, has it on the baseline, but with
    a <em>flat</em> bottom.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/POAL-1930a_6712.jpg]"

    Gamma? I'm thinking of dealing with it in the same manner in which I'm handling

  body: "<strong>John</strong>, thank you very much for the information. It's amazing
    how rich the study of alphabets could be.\r\n\r\n<em>Another question:</em> in
    Ebrima the cedilla is linked to the first leg in H+cedilla and to the second one
    in A+ and uni0245+cedilla. I cannot find information about where the cedilla would
    be placed. Are there any known cultural or language preference on this issue?\r\n\r\nActually,
    the criteria used in Ebrima is very near the way I built my project. My early
    idea was to include all base+diacritic combination as precomposed glyphs, but
    after some research (and helpful threads in Typophile) this proved not good. So
    I added all Unicode precoposed glyphs plus all <em>problematic</em> combinations.
    By problematic I mean the situations where diacritic is merged with or touch the
    base letter, and also combinations using uni0332, as the underline must match
    the base width.\r\n\r\nThis gives an idea:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Base_6173.gif]\r\n\r\n<strong>James</strong>,
    I sent you some material. Hope it helps.\r\n"

    I've seen nasalization of vowels indicated with cedilla, tilde above, tilde below
    or some nasal consonant after.\r\n\r\nThe cedilla is recommended in Cameroon since
    the 1970s/1980s so I doubt this will be replaced by the ogonek. In other countries
    some dictionaries use the cedilla to indicate some other feature (like advanced
    tongue root).\r\n\r\nThe tilde below are used at least in Sara-Ngambay in Tchad
    (I don't know if this was in the recent official alphabet, but at least it has
    been used for a few decades) or in some languages in C\xF4te d'Ivoire (even if
    the -n is recommended there).\r\n\r\nIn Senegal, there's some nasalized consonant
    or semi-vowels indicated with a circumflex, but it's not generalized."
