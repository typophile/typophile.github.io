  need to find a font suitable for all written communication - from letters to policy
  documents, business cards etc. We need 20 licences or so, but don't have a huge
  purse to play with.\r\n\r\nGotham was used on a business card design which looks
  nice but getting lots of licences is too costly.\r\n\r\nMuseo Sans was looked at
  due to its similarity (and free versions) but it's too quirky, and probably too
  wide for body copy. But I noticed it has good discounts when buying lots of licences.\r\n\r\nI
  then looked at Calluna Sans, also from exljbris since I knew there'd be the good
  deals on multiple licences.\r\n\r\nIs Calluna Sans a reasonable choice for this?
  If not, any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for reading."

  body: I don't think you need 20 licences or so. Just do your templates on a 1 CPU,
    convert the layout to fixed bitmap images and that's it.

  body: I'd have a look at what Stone Type Foundry offers. Sumner's stuff is real
    high quality, unique, affordable, but perhaps a little lacking on the OT side.
    It's all very muted and solid, just like Optima.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions.\r\n\r\nI think we do need lots of copies/licences
    as general correspondence will need to be created using the font (not just headers,
    etc.).\r\n\r\nPablo - I'd come across a few of your fonts before but not all.
    Cabin looks like it might be suitable - will have to look and play around. Looking
    forward to Quattrocento's expansion too.\r\n\r\nFrank - thanks also. Since we're
    not doing anything particularly advanced the OT features aren't too much of a
    worry. I'll be looking around what Stone Type Foundry has to offer."
