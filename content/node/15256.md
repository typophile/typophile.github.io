  after some alternate swash characters, and some general swash ornaments to go with
  it. \r\n\r\nI have a vague feeling that I saw some swash capitals at least in a
  very early copy of [[uandlc|U&lc]]. However I can't seem to find any digitised version
  of the font with anything like this. Can anyone confirm or deny this hunch? Am willing
  to swap to Goudy Heavyface if need be.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a very obvious extension
  of such a popular font, so I can't believe it hasn't been done before. If i had
  more time i'd start on my own version immediately...\r\n\r\nThanks for any leads.\r\n\r\nToby"

    completely OT: did you alter the outline of Lanston Deepdene when you prepared
    it for re-release? I'm thinking of the thickened \"text\" version of Cailfornian.
    \ Anything like that contemplated?"

    are included in a separate \"Extras\" font that comes packaged with both the Roman
    and the Italic and are incorporated into the OpenType fonts. I wanted to lift
    some inspiration from Cooper swash and do a full range of swash caps for this
    font, but time was not on my side... maybe i'll go back and do that someday...
    maybe."

    the criterion that differentiates \"standard\" from \"non-standard\" unicode glyphs?
    I have a hunch that it doesn't mean \"contains all glyphs for which Unicode provides
    a definition,\" but are Eastern European characters \"standard\"? Cyrillic? Greek?"

  body: 'Contains Cyrillic and Greek characters. There are two versions of the typeface
    which are included in the package: Oz Cooper''s original design, which opts out
    of swashbuckling for a number of characters, and a modified version, where all
    but the S have swashes added. The original design is based on Barnhardt Brother''s
    original casting of the Cooper Black Italic, with supplementary research done
    at the Newberry Library in Chicago (which houses Oz''s archive of lettering and
    correspondence) for inspiration. Scans of Oz''s hand lettering were analyzed to
    provide the structural basis for the custom version.'
