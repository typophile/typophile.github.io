(ATM Deluxe, I pine for thee. *sob*) <BR> <BR>Uh, what was the question? Oh yes&hellip; The nearest answer I could find was this: &quot;Font Book enables and disables fonts dynamically, allowing you to switch between different font sets without restarting applications.&quot; Granted, that's not necessarily auto-activation &ndash; depends what they mean by &quot;dynamically.&quot; <BR> <BR>A recent post asked about font-previewing utilities for OS X. Looks like Font Book does have that feature: &quot;Double-clicking a font file (or a group of them) in the Finder opens a preview of the font, with the option to install it in just one click.&quot; <BR> <BR>There's a decent PDF showing the features of FontBook here: <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fontbook/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fontbook/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fontbook/</a></a>.

		<div class="commentbody">If you follow Suitcase's response to Apple's FontBook, of <BR>course you'll still need Suitcase. <BR> <BR>My initial take (prediction) is FontBook will negate the need  <BR>for regular users to have a font management app, but that <BR>people managing thousands of fonts will still benefit from  <BR>something like Suitcase. It really depends on how far Apple <BR>wants to take FontBook, but I'm not expecting it to replace <BR>anything in its first release. <BR> <BR>That said, I think Suitcase, et al, have some catching up to  <BR>do in terms of ease of use and overall stability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree (about 3rd-party font-mgmt apps needing to catch up). After sulking for a few months about the loss of ATM Deluxe, I bore down and test-drove Suitcase, Font Reserve, and Font Agent Pro. I didn't like any of them, but found Font Agent Pro the least bad of the bunch. Actually, it's pretty good, except that for some reason it makes Photoshop incredibly slow &ndash; so much so that I never run the two at the same time, which is a major inconvenience. <BR> <BR>So I'm really hoping Apple will give us something that's truly competitive with the other guys.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wasn't suggesting anybody should wait for QuarkXPress 7 for anything. I just thought it was interesting news, and that people would want to know. <BR> <BR>It's an interesting question as to how long it will take them to get QXP 7 to the market. They managed version 6 in 18 months (standard for the industry, but lighting-fast for Quark). But they've also just transitioned their development to India. they now have much less experienced but perhaps many more engineers to throw at the application. <BR> <BR>I have no idea how long it will take, but my guess is that the engineering changeover will significantly increase the bugs in the application.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, regardless, I am of course not encouraging anybody to wait. InDesign is a wonderful application and everyone should buy it.  <BR> The new CS version shows all the signs of an increasingly mature application, with increasing attention to workflow issues and performance as well as continuing to add innovative new features like nested styles. <BR> <BR>Of course, seeing as I work at Adobe, you may not expect me to be unbiased in this matter. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

Apple representatives at Seybold and other venues have been quite  upfront that, for professional design/prepress/print work, Font Book will probably  not cut it for many users.  <BR> <BR>This is OK, as Font Book does many things that average users will appreciate,  and one thing that pros will REALLY appreciate: it lets us deactivate those pesky  system dfonts (Helvetica, Times, etc.) easily and without any dire consequences,  unlike in Jaguar.  <BR> <BR>Certainly in a prepress environment Julian will still need a font manager.  I think the combination of Suitcase and Font Reserve will yield a very functional  and robust product, as both approaches have their merits. And there are other  font managers around if you don't like that approach. But for auto-activation,  Font Book will not do the job.  <BR> <BR>Chuck Wege</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Merde indeed: it looks like FontBook won't be my savior after all. I can live without auto-activation (like Jean, I prefer to know what's happening behind the scenes), but this report showed up this morning on <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/panreader.html#oct16" target="_blank">MacInTouch</a>: <BR> <BR> <BR><b>Font Book warning</b>   <BR> <BR>I was eagerly looking forward to replacing Extensis' Suitcase 10 with Panther's  built-in Font Book to manage my 9000 fonts. Tonight I installed Panther and immediately  started importing type.  <BR> <BR>I dragged a folder of about 2000 fonts into the sets pane as I would in Suitcase  10. What took Suitcase 30 seconds to process took Font Book about 10 minutes.  When it was done, I realized it had activated all 2000 fonts. There does not appear  to be a way to disable this activate at addition behavior, which would make the  job of importing 9000 fonts extremely unpleasant.  <BR> <BR>Fortunately, it was instantly clear that Font Book was not going to work for  me. Activating and deactivating was very slow, and opening the application with  just 500 fonts took a very long time. I began removing my fonts from Font Book.  <BR> <BR>Here's where I discovered the worst of Font Book's bad behavior: it had added  each of the fonts to a single Fonts folder, DELETING them without warning from  the alphabetical and foundry-sorted folders that they have lived in for years.  Had I installed all of my fonts, fixing this would have taken much longer than  the half hour I just spent on it. Again, there's no obvious way to disable this  default behavior.  <BR> <BR>I wanted to love Font Book, but it has miles to go before it's any competition  for Suitcase or Font Reserve. I have a hard time understanding why Apple hyped  this application; getting designers excited about built-in font management software  and delivering a tool that definitely won't address their needs is counter-productive.  The upside is that it convinced me to download the Suitcase X1 demo; and I'm extremely  impressed with the progress Extensis has made with this application.</div>
