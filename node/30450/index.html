It is the most fantastic place. I take my students there fairly regularly. The last time we went we were given a wonderful lecture on the history of hot metal and compositing by librarian Nigel Roche. After the demonstration, the students got to have a go at using the presses. (All for a very reasonable price too. Perhaps too reasonable for these days?)

		<div class="commentbody">What the BBC account presents is a journalist's version of plans that have been developed to drastically improve St Bride Library. The £7m ($14m) sought is not simply 'To save the library' but the cost of a major refurbishment of the building, the fruits of which would include:

Building of new exhibition and reading rooms within the present lightwell void with a four-fold increase in the number of books on open access to the public.

Refurbishment of the existing reading room as a special collections area and return of the Blades Library to its pristine Victorian state as the heart of the collection.

Creation of a working demonstration area for the artefact collection with glass-screened viewing zone, coupled with refurbishment of the raked Victorian classroom adjacent to the demonstration area.

Installation of a passenger lift serving most levels of the building, augmented by stair lifts, and rationalization of the numerous floor levels to improve access for all.

Provision of a dedicated book lift between stacks and reading room.

Creation of a BS5454 : 2000 compliant archive storage area.

Provision of a substantial ground-floor cafe / bar area and an additional meeting room.

Improvements to the theatre area to provide a multi-use theatrical / conference facility.

Imposing new entrance area from Bride Lane.

That's quite a bag of improvements for the money.

After the improvements the business model is a healthy one and the future bright; without it the library is expensive to run and cannot continue indefinitely.

Fundraising is beginning to bear fruit, but the pace needs to quicken as the building works are anticipated to begin in mid-2008. Anyone wishing to assist should contact the library at http://www.stbride.org.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To answer the question 'Is the St Bride Library in danger of closing?' fully, one needs to accept a number of points. Firstly, it is intended that the Library will close for the period of the building works in any event; the real question is will it reopen afterwards. Exciting plans have been prepared to radically improve an old and quirky building, and those plans have been approved by the relevant civic authorities, with final approval given only last month. The money to carry out the works is now needed and there is a fundraising strategy in place. Application has been made to the main UK heritage funding body for half the sum required and our own efforts are bearing fruit. However the project still needs a not-inconsiderable amount of money to be secured in the next few months so that it can be assured of success.
