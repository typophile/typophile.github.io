body: "To me, bad typography is typography that does a poor job of conveying the message
  that the designer wishes to convey.  In general, good typography follows certain
  rules, pertaining to size, style, and format.  Generally good typography is easily
  readable and accomplishes its goal.  When asked to find some examples of bad typography,
  I thought what better place to look then Google.  Man did I find some.  It is amazing
  what horrible design decisions have been made for public signs! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/262_3512.jpg]\r\nThis
  first one is probably the least offensive of the four that I found.  I mean, the
  school name and sign is still readable, it's just that the curvature of the words
  makes it a little more difficult to make out.  Also the curvature makes the spacing
  between letters a little funky, so probably not the best typographic decision in
  the world.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1548881030_5bc7b32541_4900.jpg]\r\nThis
  next one is just weird.  I really thought it said \"Lilly's Horal\" instead of \"Lilly's
  Floral\" at first.  The way that the semi-cursive letters run into each other makes
  it hard to read and just weird to look at.  This totally breaks the rule of adequate
  spacing between letters.  Was the designer blind when he/she designed this sign?
  \ All I can say is that I would never want this type of sign representing my business.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/127632129_3205db2fe4_4100.jpg]\r\nThis
  third picture is also kind of amusing.  I guess the font itself isn't that bad,
  (I mean, it could be worse), but the vertical baseline of the word \"the\" really
  doesn't work here.  First of all, the letters run together and look like the stacked
  capitals \"WTF\" which is pretty funny all in itself.  However, when you look at
  it closer, you realize that it is supposed to read sideways \"THE.\"  The problem
  is that at first glance a viewer sees \"WTF MAC STORE,\" when it should really say
  \"THE MAC STORE.\"  Personally, I find this a very big mistake by the designer responsible
  for this sign.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kids-exchange-typo_3546.jpg]\r\nI
  personally think this last one speaks for itself.  Spacing problem maybe??  LOL!\r\n"
