  body: "Wow, those colors choices are nauseating together.\r\n\r\nThis is a local
    radio station right, that has an online presents and it's focused on the community?\r\nI
    think this needs to be addressed in the logo. There are several approaches you
    can take. Focus on the radio aspect (speakers, mics, radiowaves, radiotowers),
    then combine them with the web aspect. If there are any well recognized landmarks
    in Steinbach, consider incorporating them as well. You need to research to create
    a concept, I don't see a concept in this logo, and you have a lot of choices for
    a cool concept.\r\n\r\nSecond, just because this is going to be a web logo, doesn't
    mean you have to use eye gouging neon colors, subtlety is still appropriate. But
    for the time being, design in black and white until you get a concept you like
    worked out, then you can bring color in to play.\r\n\r\nFinally, stop in at your
    local bookstore and check out some books on logo design, that might help you with
    your concept."

  body: The first type treatment seems appropriate and tasteful, and the first logo
    is probably the strongest. That being said, Asvetic makes a good point in doing
    more logo research.

  body: "Steinbach is known for cars, Mennonites, and being a dry town that you have
    to pass through to go to Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I've seen very little of
    Steinbach beyond the Smitties and the Mennonite village, but this doesn't feel
    like Steinbach, it's generic."

  body: As for the logo and people claiming it has know creativity, I think what the
    point of the 2nd and 5th logo is the look of a river/brook/stream. Steinbach is
    translated as Stony Brook and that's what Steinbach was built along.
