  to FontLab and can't find answers on the web... \r\n\r\nI'm wondering how to connect
  two points that are on different paths. Every time I try to the program won't allow
  it, but will only on the same path. See attached image, I'm trying to join the two
  top points, and the lower 2 points. Any thoughts? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/B_5185.jpg]"

    to 1 it's tough to do several things, because FL uses that variable for a more
