    body: "Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner!! Thanks.\r\n\r\nAs for the campaign,
      it's from a Haggar campaign from Crispin-Porter-Bogusky. I saw it in the latest
      Luerzers Int'l Archive and was digging it. \r\n\r\nHere's the scan from the
      mag. :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/campaign_5397.jpg]"

      - the body text on the \"Pocket Pool\" ad is a sans serif, I'm not sure what,
      although the type gurus on this site would know instantly. Here's a pic of that
