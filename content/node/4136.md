body: Hey there people, I&#39;m trying to find out what the font on the attached image
  is for a job I&#39;m doing. The client wants this EXACT font, not something that
  resembles it, don&#39;t ask me why, it&#39;s one of those arty farty people. <BR>actually,
  I need to find out both fonts, the one that &#39;stanley kubrick&#39; is written
  in and the one that &#39;Barry Lyndon&#39; is written in. <BR>I hope someone can
  help me out here. <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/32724.jpg"

  body: Doesn&#39;t look too good, Roger. I have the impression that  <BR>movie logo
    is custom designed. It reminds me of the work  <BR>of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=benguiat"
    target="_blank"> Ed Benguiat</a>, but I couldn&#39;t find any match.

  body: Since the movie was done in 1975, I checked the Solotype Catalog and scanned
    some photo-type books, and I&#39;d say the letterforms were inspired by some Victorian/Art
    Nouveau-era lettering &#40;even though I think that&#39;s not the era portrayed
    in the film&#41;, but didn&#39;t see anything that made me even want to check
    it more closely for a match. I think it&#39;s very likely that it is custom lettering
    too.

  body: I took a look at the opening credits in Barry Lyndon &#40;as a Kubrick fan
    I have the DVD, of course&#41; and they appear to have been done by hand. The
    letter shapes are consistent overall, but vary in their details and proportions.
    They are also better drawn than the movie poster version &#40;as shown in Roger&#39;s
    scan above&#41;. The same style is used for the intertitles &#40;titles between
    sections&#41;, but the end credits are done in Cheltenham Oldstyle.

    target="_blank">Souvenir</a> is also similar, especially the B. The style is a
    kind of blending of Souvenir, Bookman &#40;with swashes!&#41;, and Desdemona.
    I&#39;m not sure why Kubrick chose it for a movie set in the 18th century. It
    evokes the 1970s more than anything else. <BR> <BR>&#40;In spite of the strange
    choice for the titles, this is still one of my favorite films. It&#39;s absolutely
    beautiful, but you need to watch it on a big screen--and not on a tv.&#41;

  body: '&#34;Barry Lyndon&#34; could be based in a typeface, with a swash variant
    and perhaps lowercase. <BR>Here is a sample from the Soundtrack CD &#40;bad printed
    and small reproduction of a the LP record I guess&#41;. I see the long &#34;R&#34;
    in BARRY a little bit different than the swash one in the credits, that could
    be a modified, and the same with the &#34;A&#34;, or an alternate for this one.
    <BR>It also looks it could have lowercase from the same family, the last sample
    are details from a 1976 not really well printed french version of the poster I
    have, it seems it could be the same lowercase typeface than the american &#40;&#34;a&#34;
    &#34;d&#34;&#41;... Or maybe they just mixed lower and upper... <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t
    found it obviously, this could be a typeface, an old one, or maybe the whole thing
    was just done for the movie, like in the opening credits. <BR>I don&#39;t know
    Roger, hope it helps, I am intrigued too. <BR> <BR>Could not be more agree with
    Mark&#39;s opinion about the movie and how to see it, the light is special. <BR>
