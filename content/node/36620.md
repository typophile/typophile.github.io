  body: "As Misa said, Dennis, Ulysses was done using Gigi - albeit heavied up.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Looking at a <a href=\"http://ulyssesvoyage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">better image</a>,
    it is still clear that Gigi was used, but I wonder how it was done. All three
    s's came out looking different - as you said, Dennis."
