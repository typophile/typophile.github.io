- body: "I think it's tracked too tightly, and I might try more contrast between the
    two font weights. The c draws too much attention right now, and I think maybe
    it's because it looks much fatter than the r. But, it could just be that it's
    too close?\r\n\r\nThe mark is cool and I especially like the placement. Have you
    tried flipping it so the tail end points in? Just a thought."

  body: My two cents. The mark sounds to me very "tribal" and "organic", surely "creative"
    and "dynamic" as well. The relationship with animation/movies is not immediate,
    though. I will say tattoos or garden design if I didn't know the company's service.
    I like the placement and the contrast between organic logo/rational type. I will
    also consider alternatives to Helvetica.

  body: "That's a very interesting mark. I didn't see the letters at first, it looked
    more like a theatrical mask. \r\n\r\nThe white outline will need to be fatter,
    especially for small sizes.\r\n\r\nI second finding an alternative to Helvetica.
    There are lots of attractive grotesques."

  body: "immediate thoughts are its very feminine (not saying that's a bad thing,
    just an observation).\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you're going for motion/vibrant over
    anything else.\r\nimo it's not getting the young/creative thing...but that could
    just be me.\r\n\r\nwhile it might be a nice little bonus, I really wonder whether
    forcing 'letters' into the mark is necessary.\r\n\r\nmotion arcs, line, onion
    skin."

  body: My worry is that the white stroke on the mark will completely disappear in
    print, for one (if it were printed), or two, if the mark gets any smaller than
    we see here.

- body: "I didn't see the letters in the mark at all. That said, I don't think it
    matters. The mark is cool. I don't think it's feminine, I think it's edgy organic/tattoo/Celtic/wrought-iron-ish.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and no, it doesn't say \"animation studio\" immediately -- Thank God! If I see
    one more logo with stylized mouses or funky pixels I'm gonna open a vein. I much
    prefer an evocative design that suits the tastes of the studio's customers instead
    of the tools a studio uses to create animation. It's not like they're selling
    animation work to software developers. "

  body: "thnx guys for the comments,\r\n\r\ni ve actually tried it to be tribal and
    organic as Alaskan n Luca said\r\nto give the meaning of alive n life-like feel.\r\n\r\ni
    also agree with the small space between the mark, sure will try\r\nout a new version
    with more space.ty evenbong.\r\n\r\nforcing the word arc was an attempt with the
    style,but i am open \r\nto suggestion to make it more descriptive about the service
    which\r\nis animation,will there be a tweak it and wat exactly wd to make it\r\nscream
    ANIMATION !!"

  body: "it's a tough one, lots of people see animation as computer generated, rather
    than story telling and bringing things to life (regardless of medium). It's also
    not a genre.\r\n\r\nbut maybe there's something in that...'bringing things to
    life'\r\n\r\n\r\narc - noah, the frames came in two by two.\r\n\r\njust throwing
    it out there.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n"

  body: "The mark and the type don't feel like they belong together.\r\n\r\nThe mark
    also evokes \"tattoo.\" Overly complicated and not memorable. If someone saw this
    for 5 seconds, would they remember how to draw it later? I know that's not the
    litmus test of a good design, but I'd consider simplifying it. Your approach is
    appropriate. Let that swooshy thing crystallize into something simpler.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    \"AS\" can become a swirling monogram? You've almost got a lowercase \"a\" there..."

    the last variant that looks like a butterfly. But which one does your client like?\r\n\r\nBTW
    I was just looking at <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/samuelstype/colin-samuels/\">Colin
    Samuels</a> and it struck me it might work for this company."

  body: "An 'arc' suggests energy leaping upwards from one point to another, like
    a rainbow. Your logo hangs down like a lazy decoration. Why not have it 'leap'
    upward from one point to another? Every arc I've ever seen arcs upwards, not downwards.\r\n\r\n.-^-.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I don't think you need to try to spell 'arc' with the lines. It isn't obvious
    enough. Focus on emotion and energy, not cleverness."
