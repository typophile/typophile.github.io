  should hyphenate a sentence like:\r\n\r\n\"the black cat is still around, playing
  with the \r\nblue ball\"\r\n\r\nthis way:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"the black cat is still around,
  \r\nplaying with the blue ball\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\"the black cat is still around,
  playing \r\nwith the blue ball\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid separating words, and keeping together
  words that go \"together\".  But on web sites, is it really important to follow
  this kind of rule, if you know that the user can change the size of the font as
  he wants ?\r\n\r\nthanks !"

    use of the hyphen is to divide words that do not fit on a justified line of type.
    Usual texts are treated different than poetry, anyhow, we use the <em>hyphen</em>
    \u2018-\u2019 to separate words (not sentences) and/or to create compound words,
    write numbers, adding certain prefixes, etc.\r\n"

  body: "James and Alessandro silently let pass by, the term is not \"hyphenation\"
    for words. Hyphenation is when a word itself breaks.\r\n\r\n<cite>\u201Cthe black
    cat is still around,\r\nplaying with the blue ball\u201D\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\u201Cthe
    black cat is still around, playing\r\nwith the blue ball\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    come across this problem a lot (in typesetting, that is) with the large font size
    I use for chapter titles. I prefer personally to set the top line longer than
    any subsequent lines, hold \"the\"'s together with the next word, and ... well
    ... whatever looks best. (Sometimes it takes several tries).\r\n\r\nFor a web
    page, I don't think I could be bothered :-)\r\n\r\nYou can tack words together
    with & nbsp; -- the non-breakable space (for example, \"the blue\"), or use the
    HTML < nobr > .. < /nobr > tags, which work just like InDesign's \"No Break\"
    feature. But you have to consider that with all different browsers, font sizes,
    and window widths, virtually everyone will get to see a different broken paragraph.
    Imagine doing this for every <em>possible</em> bad break ...\r\n\r\nBesides, as
    current browsers do not use any intelligence at all, breaking paragraphs comes
    down to \"Oi, the line is full. Go to next line.\" SO, if you use one of these
    tricks, the text will look <em>worse</em> instead of better."
