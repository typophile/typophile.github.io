<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I did a search for 'pronunciation' and found a couple forums with dead links. Does anyone know where that forum is which talks about the correct pronunciation of typefaces, or know where on the web I can find more information. Not any typeface in general, but more of a guide on all or a lot of typefaces. Thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sounds like something we should turn into a Wiki entry! I found a list here, which I borrowed from mostly for entries rather than pronunciation: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/fonts-faq/part5/
Here's my take on pronunciation:
Benguiat: BEN-gat
Univers: oo'-nih-VAIR
Arnold Boecklin: AR-nolled BOKE-lin (the BOKE part is actually a German o with umlaut, but that's as close as most English speakers will get)
Fette Fraktur: FET-uh FROK-tour
Peignot: pay-NYOH
Sabon: sah-BON (second syllable should have a nasal element, like bonjour)
Veljovic: VELL-yoh-vitch'
Zapf: tzopf

I thought this myself until Typecon. Now I'm not so sure. Everyone, including Bruno Steinert (and, I think, Mike Parker) who worked directly with Frutiger for many years pronounce it like the English word "universe".
Now I'm just completely confused.

<div class=commentbody>Another way to 'phoneticize':
Fraktur: Frahk-tour
Zapf: Tzahpf
The correct pronunciation for the 'a' in these is the sound of 'a' in 'father'. (The sound of the English 'a' in 'cat' is not a part of German.)

<div class=commentbody>>pronounce it so many different ways.
I think there is always a choice of trying to pronounce it as in the language or origin, or Anglicise (or Americanize) it. If you have studied the language or are good at foreign phonemes, then my view is go for it. But it is perfectly acceptable to do an Anglicized version. So Univers is also 'universe', etc.
In the case where the phoneme exists in English, then I think it preferable to use it.
For example, we have the 'ts' or 'tz' sound, as in 'nuts', though in English it never starts a word. And we have the 'a' in 'father', as well as 'cat'. So I think 'tzahpf' (correct German) or 'zahpf' (z as in zoo, a bit Anglicized) is preferable to 'zapf', with the z as in zoo and the a as in cat. </div>

Funny you should ask.
I had to ask Ilene Strizver just to be sure, right before I gave the "Type & Design Education" presentation at TypeCon.
I always knew the pronunciation as LOO-BAAL-in ("BAAL" rhymes with the name "AL").
But once I heard Ed Benguiat pronounce Herb's last name as LOOB-AH-lin (as in lube-ah-lyn), which made me question since I never met Herb myself.
Ilene had worked with Herb Lubalin, and she said Benguiat was pulling my leg (again).

<div class=commentbody>>I do feel self-conscious sometimes about saying it that way
We Americans, bless us, want to show our respect for foreigners by trying to pronounce their names their way. The English tend to unapologetically Anglicize foreign names. (At least traditionally; don't know whether that's changed.) Either way is ok, in my view. The problem with typeface names is that they have been so little spoken that for many there is no standard way to Anglicize them, in the sense that you can look it up and get something authoritative.
So I say do what you are comfortable with--GAIR-a-mond or Gahr a MON (nasal 'on'), oo-ni-VAIR or universe--and enjoy the type! </div>

<div class=commentbody>That Bitstream song, Mr. Simonson, is <em>pure</em> gold.
Can we have an Adobe -- FontShop -- ITC/Monotype sing off at the next TypeCon? I can already see how ITC/Monotype could potentially pull an all nighter :)
On the same note -- sorry to veer off here -- check this out, a song called, rather inapropriately, </em><a href=http://sevcom.com/opdate/>Kern That Bembo Tighter</a>.</em>
By the way, how do you pronounce Fountain's Waldstein? 'Woldsteen', 'Waaldstein' or 'Vaaldstein' as it is spoken in Germany (maybe)?</div>

<div class=commentbody>And... (now you've got me thinking...)
Walbaum: WAHL-bowm <em>or</em> VAHL-bawm (the German way)?
Goudy: GOW-dy (see <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy</a>)
Barmeno: bar-MEEN-oh <em>or</em> bar-MEN-oh?
Berthold: BER-told <em>or</em> BEART (rhymes with "bear")-hold?
Bodoni: bo-DOH-nee (I presume the Italian way) <em>or</em> bo-DONE (rhymes with "bone")-ee?
Caslon: CAS-lun <em>or</em> CAS-lawn?
Fago: FAY-go <em>or</em> FAH-go?
Scala: SCAY-luh <em>or</em> SCA-lah?
Keivit: KYEH-vit?
Fenice: rhymes with Venice? <em>or</em> fen-EES
Univers: your pronunciations are very helpful, but I've always called it (erroneously, I suppose) YOU-ni-verz
And lastly, Comic Sans: KO-mic SANDS <em>or</em> ko-MEEK SAWN (nasally)... you know, lipstick on a pig and all...
I could go on all day!

I love this, it's like Tarr-Szay. Maybe it will help the reputation of Comic Sans. If we put enough lipstick on this pig, who knows?
Mike Abbink could share the story of Kievit; it's very sweet. Is he listening?.....
I'm afraid I'm only adding to the mess. My new typeface has a name that apparently nobody can pronounce when they first read it. Beorcana is not that strange when you realize it's pronounced like Bjork, with -ana on the end: Byor-KON-uh. But my family and friends keep mangling the name when they say it. Maybe I should have named it ESPN. ;D</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow! Feh-KNEE-chay? I would never have guessed. I suppose that's why we need this thread after all. Beginning designers rarely hear the name spoken; they just see it listed in a font menu.
Two more that came up this morning:
Sabon: with or without a nasal ending?
Futura: FYOO-too-rah <em>or</em> <em>or</em> FYOO-tchur-ah <em>or</em> FOO-tchur-ah?
In fact, name pronunciation came up in a class today, where a guy apologized for pronouncing St. Augustine, AW-gus-teen (which is how the city in Florida is pronounced), rather than the more popular (in academic circles, anyhow), uh-GUS-tin. Naturally, I immediately wanted to create a font with that name to fit Mark's Maxim above.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If I may crash in: FRUIT-iger, the German way.
And a couple more on German: VAHL-bowm would be best.
KAH-bull is fine, and KAH-bell is possible — depending on Koch having a northern or southern German accent? But the a in Zapf is short by all means, actually closer to CAT: so, TSAPF.
Incidentally, the same should have applied for Bach, the English pronunciation is a little wide of the mark. Just in case someone might fancy naming a typeface after him. We already have Handel Gothic :)
A little Latin (or Italian?): Beata is Bay-AH-tah. Wonder if Futura should be Latin with a touch of German accent?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Having read an article in the September issue of Computer Arts Magazine (UK), I was amused to read Jason Arber's comments regarding the name of my typeface Chevin. He reckons that – "my grandmother could think of a better name than this bizarre contraction of Chav and Kevin".
I hadn't thought of that when I named it – it's actually named after the hill that overlooks the town where I live, as I couldn't think of a name and looked out of the window and thought 'That'll do'.
– See the time, effort and complicated tought processes we type designers put in to come up with a catchy name?
BTW it's pronounced 'Shevin' as in shout, not Chevin as in Charles. Oh, and while I'm at it; Houschka is pronounced 'Hooshka', not as in house.

<div class=commentbody>I share SourisNoire's surprise that no one is jumping at the chance to use those IPA glyphs. Here is my take. I added what I took to be the original languages in parentheses. Of course, in English pronunciation, these will all be appropriately anglicised. I myself anglicise the words heavily when speaking in English. I must say though that I have hardly ever had the opportunity to pronounce many of these names in real life.
I made no effort to reflect regional variances in pronunciation (e.g. the dozens of varieties of Swiss German). Please correct me if you find mistakes.

<div class=commentbody><em>Considering the font itself isn’t Swedish</em>
<strong>That’s</strong> what counts?
What if I made a font called Tschichold. Should it be pronounced like an average Finn would?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Shouldn’t it? I suppose whoever designed the typeface and named it should know best. Which doesn't mean you should pronounce the French word Univers with a German-Swiss accent... Just splitting hairs for fun, you know. Nobel is a household word anyway in any country so the font can follow local custom too.
Tschichold would be a problem to transpose into plain Finnish phonetics wouldn't it (Sisold?)? But I know you're good at languages and would get the German pronunciation right. Anyway, if you named a font after Tschichold, you would be infringing Presence Typo copyright. Unless the court buys the argument that your Tschichold is pronounced differently :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jongseong, I think you are right that pronounciation in many languages can only be done properly by using phonetic symbols--or by explaining which English letters you are going to use represent a specific sound or phonetic symbol.
However, as most people don't know the phonetic symbols--I only know a few--I think it is just too complicated to try to represent pronounciation in original languages accurately. What those who contribute to the wiki could do very helpfully is to indicate an appropriate or acceptable English pronounciation.
For example if you ask Zapf, my guess is that he would find zapf, with the z as in zoo and the a in father an acceptable English variant. But probably z as in zoo and a as in cat less acceptable. If Dan can ask Zapf--who has taught to English speaking students so he would have dealt with the issue--that would settle it.
An example of the difficulty of doing phonetics is your phonetic version of German names. You use the 'schwa', the upside down e that represents a sound* common in English and Hebrew. However, if I'm not mistaken the schwa is isn't officially part of German. So using it to represent German names is already 'Anglicizing' them. Of course there are many dialects and pronounciations of German, so it may be accurate in some, but I don't think in official 'high German'. Perhaps some German speakers who know phonetics can enlighten us on contemporary German pronunciation. --But it is an endless discussion, as this thread shows.
*In English, the schwa is the sound of the 'e' in 'the man'. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The schwa is perfectly OK in Kabel and Neue, but in Akzidenz I rather think the stress is on the end, like this [ak.ʦɪ.ˈdɛnʦ ɡʁo.ˈtɛsk]. I may be proved wrong by a genuinely German forum-goer.
Typing in IPA is fun, but isn't it awfully time-consuming? I cheated for this post, it's all copy-pasted, thanks Jongseong.</div>

<div class=commentbody>MHSmith, you're probably right about the stress being on the end in Akzidenz. That's why I probably should have had a disclaimer that I don't speak German (or Dutch or Serbian for that matter)--it's all educated guesswork.
I happen to be interested in pronunciation issues because when I write foreign proper names in Korean in the hangul alphabet, I have to know approximately how they are pronounced so I can transcribe them correctly. And I've found there is just no entirely satisfactory way of communicating pronunciations in writing, especially when different languages are involved. Things like regional variations in pronunciation in both the source and target languages, the degree to which the pronunciation should be adapted to the sound system of the target language...
So it's a hopeless task. But I'm used to the IPA (most dictionaries I have use modified versions of it), and they are certainly fun to type.
By the way, I did study Swedish in university and 'no-BELL' sounds like a perfectly good approximation of how Nobel would be pronounced in Swedish.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Fascinating. I wish I knew more about Asian languages and scripts. But there's plenty of fun in our own little regional variations in the use of the Latin alphabet. About Nobel, shouldn't the O sound like a long OO even without receiving the stress? I admit my notions of Swedish are recent and vague. And about source and target languages, I have realised after a moment that my own proposals for pronouncing fonts were biased by British usage. When I say a cat, it may sound more or less like Zapf, but a Texan would disagree with my transcription.
Time for bed now in our corner of the world.</div>

<div class=commentbody>«MHSmith, you’re probably right about the stress being on the end in Akzidenz.»
for the e, i'd rather say the sound like the e of "dentist".
but you're right, im pronouncing frutiger like i'd do in swiss-german, not high-german, where the u gets alot more emphasis than in swiss-german. i pronounce the u closed if that makes sense, and yes, there are so many swiss-german accents anyway. i grew up in zurich which has a short and un-melodical sound while frutiger grew up in the mountain region near berne (interlaken iirc), which features a very melodical sound.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>About Nobel, shouldn’t the O sound like a long OO even without receiving the stress?</cite>
Yes, you're right. According to my dictionary, it should be [nʊ.ˈbɛl], so the O sound is similar to the English long OO in quality, although not in quantity, as it is short, not long. I just meant it's a lot closer to 'no-BELL' than to the word 'noble'.</div>
