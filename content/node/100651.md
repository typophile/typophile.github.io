body: "Should occasional Cyrillic or Greek be italicized in an otherwise Latin-script
  text? The usual practice for English text is to italicize Latin-script words in
  non-English languages, <em>comme \xE7a</em>. Hebrew, Arabic, Coptic, Gothic, Devanagari,
  and the like are never italicized to my knowledge, partly because there is no real
  italic in those languages, and partly because the writing systems are different
  enough that they don\u2019t need to be otherwise distinguished from the body text.
  But what about Greek and Cyrillic? In the old days of metal type I guess people
  just used whatever they had for those scripts, but in the modern era of Unicode
  and digital type it\u2019s typical to have typefaces with harmonized Greek, Cyrillic,
  and Latin. Are they different enough to not need to be set off from the body, or
  should they be italicized?\r\n\r\nI note that italics can problematic for Cyrillic
  which has distinctively different letterforms in its italic incarnations. How many
  people who can read Cyrillic will actually recognize an italicized yat?"

  body: "I would say italicize Greek as one would French etc.\r\nMany letters of the
    Greek alphabet look like Latin letters although they do not correspond. \r\nSo
    remove the possibility that nu will be read as /v, or rho as /p, and so on.\r\nAlso,
    scholars will appreciate that this degree of contrast between upright and slanted
    forms is old-school (when the default Greek fonts had a slanted lower case).\r\nFurthermore,
    this would give Greek the same <em>typographic</em> treatment as French etc.,
    so would be consistent in an English document that quoted both French and Greek
    extracts.\r\n\r\nAnd especially for that last reason, I would say italicize Cyrillic
    also."

    to italicize a different script. The reason why it is better to italicize different
    languages within the Latin alphabet, is to indicate clearly to the reader that
    there is a loan word or citation from a different language following. A different
    script is enough visible change.\r\nIf, however one had to set several words in
    different languages and scripts within the same text, i would italicize also the
    other scripts."

    in meaning to Hebrew \u05D0\u05B8\u05DE\u05B5\u05DF <em>\u0294\u0101m\u0113n</em>
    and hence Greek \u1F00\u03BC\u03AE\u03BD <em>am\u1E17n</em> and Russian \u0430\u043C\u0438\u0301\u043D\u044C
    <em>am\xEDn\u02BC</em> (the Russian reflecting shift of Greek \u03B7 <em>\u0113</em>
    to <em>i</em>), though not actually used in translations of religious materials.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
    another longer example with only Cyrillic.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe scientific names
    all come from Russian, and were originally given by Johann Julius Walbaum during
    his time in the Russian Far East. The name <em>O. tshawytscha</em> is from Russian
    \u0447\u0430\u0432\u044B\u0301\u0447\u0430 /t\u0255a\u02C8v\u0268t\u0255a/ which
    is itself from Itel\u02BCmen <em>\u010Devi\u010Dev</em>. <em>O. nerka</em> is
    in Russian \u043D\u0435\u0301\u0440\u043A\u0430 /\u02C8n\u02B2erka/, but in Siberian
    dialects \u043D\u044F\u0301\u0440\u043A\u0430 /\u02C8n\u02B2arka/, and which appears
    to be from Proto-Samoyedic <em>*n\u02B8\u028Crk\u0259</em>, compare Nganasan <em>n\u02B8or\u0259</em>.
    <em>O. kisutch</em> is Russian \u043A\u0438\u0301\u0436\u0443\u0447 /\u02C8k\u02B2i\u0290ut\u0255/
    but in Siberian dialects \u043A\u0438\u0301\u0437\u0443\u0447 /\u02C8k\u02B2izut\u0255/,
    coming from Itel\u02BCmen <em>kizuez</em>; the dialectal form is the source of
    the scientific name. <em>O. keta</em> is particularly interesting: in Russian
    it is \u043A\u0435\u0301\u0442\u0430 /\u02C8k\u02B2eta/ but this is again not
    native; rather, the source is probably Evenki <em>ke\u02D0ta</em> \u2018<em>O.
    keta</em>\u2019 or perhaps Even <em>q\xE6ta</em> \u2018dead salmon after spawning\u2019
    (unrelatedly, Tlingit also has <em>xein</em> /xe\u02D0n/ \u2018spawned-out salmon\u2019
    < Pre-Tlingit <em>*xa\u02B0yn</em>, cognate with Eyak <em>xa\u02D0nih</em>; also
    cf. PA <em>*x\u02B8a\u02D0n</em> \u2018old age\u2019, cognate with Tlingit <em>shaan</em>
    /\u0283a\u02D0n/ \u2018old, elderly\u2019 < Pre-Tlingit <em>*\u0161a\u02B0n</em>)
    both of which are themselves probably from Chukchi-Koryak, e.g. Chukchi <em>qetaqet</em>
    \u2018<em>O. keta</em>\u2019. The Russian for O. gorbuscha is simply \u0433\u043E\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0301\u0448\u0430
    /gor\u02C8bu\u0282a/ derived from \u0433\u043E\u0440\u0431 /gorb/ \u2018hump\u2019
    and describing the pronounced hump that develops on the backs of males during
    spawning.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOf course this looks unpleasant here because
    Georgia doesn\u2019t have all the appropriate characters and browsers substitute
    various fonts badly."

    as the general rule and reserve their italic styles to specific groups (as pronunciation
    or an ancient form). Hence, you have one more option to distinguish things.'
