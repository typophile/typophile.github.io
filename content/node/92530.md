body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some critiques for this project I'm working
  on at the moment. This is my first type design project so far.\r\n\r\n\"Interborough
  is inspired from the signage system of IRT, (Interborough Rapid Transit, hence the
  name) New York subway system in the 1900s \u2013 1940s. Interborough collects the
  inconsistent characteristics of thosesigns and combines with a personal touch to
  create a new, unique design itself. The sans-serif typeface explores the American
  compact modular style and try to balance the solid, geometric form with the subtle
  curviness in its minor eccentric details. Interborough employs a con\x1Fdent and
  optimistic look that is found in visual designs of early 20th century. In short,
  Interborough is unique but familiar, structured but versatile, nostalgic but up-to-date.\"\r\n\r\nI
  want this typeface to not only function well for signage, display purposes (I will
  have Display variations with king caps) but also usable as a text typeface (for
  relatively short body of text).\r\n\r\nI have attached in this the PDF file with
  glyph table, waterfall and sample body text. At the moment I've just pretty much
  design the glyphs, so I know the kerning at the moment is quite terrible, sorry.\r\n\r\nHope
  you can take a look and give me some feedbacks!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nG\r\n\r\n"

    and therefore also different color.\r\n- Why that colliding /%/?\r\n- /k/ is malformed
    and too wide.\r\n- /r/ is also too wide.\r\n- The turn of the stem of /a/ at the
    lower right looks cut.\r\n- I'd make /c/ and /s/ align with their terminals when
    written together (/cs/).\r\n\r\nRemember to be sceptic about my comments :-) Good
    work so far. I think you can start with the kerning."

  body: "-I agree with the comment above about the R, perhaps use the alternate at
    the bottom of the page.  \r\n\r\n- The lowercase double bowled \"g\" is nice,
    however I do not think that it is cohesive with the rest of the typeface.  Again
    use the alternate in the mix to see how it works the second time around.\r\n      -if
    you really want to use the double-bowl, I would suggest that you make the negative
    spaces a little larger \r\n       so that you can maintain the same look throughout
    the typeface, which has turned out really nicely.  \r\n\r\n-It seems that a few
    letters are \"cut-off\" as LexLuengas has pointed out.  Perhaps just make these
    sections a little longer so that it seems like they are finished.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate
    the use of hipster lorem.  Definite +1.  Kerning would be a great next step.  I
    know this process isn't easy, and the typeface looks great!  "

  body: "While I like the twist to the |Q|, I believe it will look like a fault to
    the readers eye; the alternative is nice, but looses some of the originality,
    something inbetween maybe? \r\n\r\nLexLuengas already mentioned the distrubing
    look of the touching |%|, I totally second that.\r\n\r\nThe very curvy shoulders
    on |n|m|h| make them look extra squeezed next to, say, the |g| or |e| - |b|d|q|p|
    have less parallel strokes in them, so with those I think it looks good, even
    though the connection to the stem seems very sharp to me (the |d| and |q| more
    so than the |b| and |p|). I think this also makes those letters' shoulders visually
    jump out above the x height in the text samples.\r\n\r\nJust my novice comments,
    really like the feel of the font :)"
