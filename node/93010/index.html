The past 2 issues of the magazine have used typefaces created by high profile type designers in appropriate cities and I wish to continue this precedent by representing the city through the typography. 

Any help or opinions on Greek type please get in touch! thanks. Feel free to email me here: hello@luketonge.com</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although a font made by a Greek person is certainly more likely to exhibit Greek characteristics, the important thing (I assume) is finding the right Greek-looking font no matter who made it. The reader will get more out of the font itself (which he cannot escape) than simply knowing that the designer is Greek (which he might never even find out anyway).

If you can get in touch with Michail Semoglou* he might be able to furnish you with a nice Hellenized Latin font he showed me a few years ago.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey everyone! thanks so much for the quick responses! Some great leads to explore and follow up. @Nick Shinn you're spot on, for me it is more important to have an authentic greek-designed typeface to use as a headline font throughout the mag than it is to have a 'greek-looking' font. 

Here's Alex Sheldon's 'Detroit' we used for our Detroit issue – http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/detroit/
and for our latest issue, London, Seb Lester's 'Soho' – http://www.formfiftyfive.com/2012/05/boat-magazine-london/

Please do keep getting in touch or replying on here with helpful links – it's a massive help!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Detroit font nicely evokes Detroit. Soho sort of evokes London, but surely there are other fonts -probably including some by type designers from London- that evoke it better. I'm wondering what the rationale could be for focusing so much on the geography of the designer. Is there after all any person that's "pure" Athenian for example? What's the criterion for being "from Athens"?

More useful than a cute play on the idea of a font physically coming from a city would be a font that evokes that city no matter where it was made. For example if you find a font that somehow evokes Athens, but it was made in Thessaloniki, would you rather use a Parisian-looking font made by somebody was born in Thessaloniki but currently lives in Athens? If so, how do you justify that beyond your own whim? This path is clearly fraught with peril...

A suggestion that's only partly serious:

		<div class="commentbody">@hrant, this is all very subjective and i'm not sure that i've explained my position incredibly well... Yes, Detroit the typeface accurately evokes Detroit the city, as it was intended to do. Soho was not meant to represent London, but it does so very well and is hugely versatile for magazine headlines. As for other typefaces 'evoking London better' – perhaps – but I am trying to avoid trite and painfully obvious choices that remove any element of subjectivity or sensitivity from the work. Detroit you could argue does this, but its versatility and complexity elevate it above this. 

The basic rationale is one of authenticity. Of wanting the magazine to truly be 'of the place' Each issue is dedicated to a city, and so when possible I like to match a great typeface or family by a local type designer, to represent that place. In answer to your question, No, I'm not so daft that i'd pass up a great typeface by someone from another Greek city, and go with something less-suited to the issue from a 'pure-athenian'. So yes, the primary task is to find a typeface that represented both the look and feel of the city – but to narrow the huge pool of options a good place to start is by looking at type designers from that city. They are also usually more interested in their type being used to represent 'their' city, and as such generally are happy to donate their typeface in exchange for the exposure the magazine gives them. 

And yes, as the art-director of the magazine, my whim also plays a part. 

The tricky part is finding a typeface that represents a city I've never visited. We spend time in the city making the magazine but time constraints sometimes dictate needing to get a head-start on the process, hence me doing some research and investigation in advance. 

Anyway, enough waffle. A modern, Greek, authentic typeface is what I'm after :) thanks so much for taking the time to engage with me about this! I hope i've made sense.

I certainly think you can find a font made in Greece -and probably Athens- that will do all you need. If you ever feature a city with few type designers however you might have to improvise.

Anyway I for one would love to see your results, now and in the future.
