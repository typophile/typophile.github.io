  question is:\r\n\r\nHow acceptable would it be to use Lucida Grande (or something
  from the same family) for print (as opposed to screen)?\r\n\r\nAnd/or\r\n\r\nWhat
  are some similar alternatives that work well in print?"

    not designed for screen use.\r\nI think Lucida Grande is just a better hinted
    Lucida Sans.\r\nSo why not using it for print."

    said, if you need a fairly modern sans serif, Lucida Sans could work pretty well.\r\nLucida
    Grande, on the other hand, isn't practical for print mostly because it lacks an
    italic."
