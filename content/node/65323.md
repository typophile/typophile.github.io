  from a professional person point of view,\r\nMy question is: Should my font include

    the question at hand...\r\n\r\nWouldn't that depend entirely on the intended application?
    If you are the only one using the font it doesn't make any difference - until
    you need one of the glyphs that are missing. You could update it as the need arose.
    For any kind of distribution, it should be complete. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "The longer version is: what is the target for the your typeface?\r\nI'm not
    familiar with the arabic script, but I'll cite some examples in which you could
    choose <em>not</em> to include the full character set.\r\nLatin script: \r\n-
    a display face could include only uppercase letters. \r\n- a text face aimed at
    Western Europe/USA most likely would not include glyphs needed for Eastern Europe
    scripts.\r\n- a text/display face intended only for \"modern\" use will not include
    historical forms like the long \"s\". \r\nCyrillic:\r\n- if the market is just
    Russia, it could not include ukrainian-only letters.\r\nGreek:\r\n- the Greek
    Unicode range include Coptic too, I don't know how many modern Greek typefaces
    include the latter.\r\nJapanese:\r\n- a face intended for children would include
    Hiragana, Katakana, and probably latin characters, but only a subset of, if any,
    Kanji."

  body: You will need to include alphabetic presentation forms which are located in
    a different block. These are identical to the kerning forms to be used when the
    typeface is used normally; i.e., in text.

  body: "Thanks all, nice one Nick\r\n\r\nOK,\r\n\r\nArabic Presentation Forms_A,
    FD20~FDFD, it contains ligatures, not alphabets, and I'm interested only two glyphs
    FD3E & FD3F which are Arabic Brackets.\r\nWhat do you think from professional
    point of view, what a Font Designer should have to do with the rest of the glyphs
    present in these ranges.\r\n\r\nShould I include these all glyphs in my font and
    put something like a circle in them or don't add these glyphs in my font?\r\n"

  body: "As a minumum, I recommend supporting all the characters that are part of
    the Windows and Macintosh Arabic 8-bit codepages. These ensures backwards compatibility,
    and ensures that you are supporting all the basic characters necessary for the
    three largest language groups using the script: Arabic, Persian and Urdu.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to support additional languages that employ the script, then you need
    to support more of the 0600 Unicode range, and perhaps the Arabic Supplement range
    (0750). You can either aim for complete language coverage or you can research
    the needs of individual languages and support the characters for these. If there
    are particular languages that you are interested in supporting, but are unsure
    about what characters you need, let me know and I can probably help you.\r\n\r\nYou
    do <strong>not</strong> need any Presentation Form codepoints, although the decorative
    parentheses are useful as you've already discovered. You do not need ligature
    characters or positional form characters, because these can all be handled using
    OpenType Layout substitutions based on the 0600 range characters. The Presentation
    Form characters are only included in Unicode for legacy reasons, and can generally
    be ignored.\r\n\r\nNote that there is an Arabic Special Interest Group forum on
    Typophile:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/366"

  body: "<em>...the Greek Unicode range include Coptic too, I don\u2019t know how
    many modern Greek typefaces include the latter.</em>\r\n\r\nWhen Greek and Coptic
    were first encoded in Unicode, the common letters were unified in the Greek block,
    e.g. Greek alpha = Coptic alpha, etc. And the Coptic letters that are not part
    of the Greek alphabet were encoded in the same block. Later, Unicode accepted
    that they had made a mistake, and that it would be better to encode Coptic independent
    from Greek, so the new Coptic block was added (2C80-2CFF) to disunify the common
    letters; however, the other Coptic letters remained in the Greek block, because
    that would present fewer problems for software makers than trying to deprecate
    those codepoints and move the characters to a new block.\r\n\r\nEvery once in
    a while, I get a request from a client who wants to support the entire Greek Unicode
    block. I can usually talk them out of supporting the Coptic letters in the Greek
    block, unless they intend to support the Coptic block too. However, one client
    did insist that I make the Greek block Coptic glyphs, even though they were not
    supporting Coptic and only because they were included in the Greek block. Sometimes
    software developers want simply to know with 100% certainty that a font supports
    all the assigned codepoints in a given Unicode block."
