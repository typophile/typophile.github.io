  been upgraded and sometimes they even look better! With the amount of designs and
  fonts out there, companies sometimes forget about their old ones. [[http://www.printsome.com/blog/2015/5-worn-vintage-brand-logos-look-better-original/|This
  post]] shows some examples of logos being able to capture that vintage look without
  really trying! What do you think are some other fonts and logos that manage to do
  that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Reading the linked article quickly you might get the impression that those
    logos are still being used, for Coke she says \"that same old typography\", but
    they've been updated. \r\n\r\nThe Coke logo looks similar to the original one
    but has been updated at least 10 times.  The Levi logo is different. The Ford
    logo retains a similar script but is now within an oval shape. \r\n\r\nA vintage
    look can be effective sometimes, especially if an old-fashioned look is marketable,
    or if the logo is iconic, but in many cases the logos have been updated in subtle
    ways.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coke_4795.png]"
