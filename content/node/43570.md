body: "Greetings Typohiles!\r\n\r\nI have been lurking this forum for quite awhile
  and now that I have run into a serious fontmaking problem myself I could think of
  no better people to turn to than the Typophiles.\r\n\r\nSo here is my project: this
  is part of my final thesis, so I am pretty desperate in making it work. The basic
  idea behind it all is create a font that will\u2014via script\u2013generate the
  outlines of each glyph that is typed. So if a user were to type one line, erase
  it and then type the same line afterwards, the glyphs would come out completely
  different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aaaargh_4846.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is why the working title for this font is \u201CAaaargh!!\u201D.\r\n \r\nUnlike
  with Beowolf, whose PostScript method will render the changes applied to the letters
  only in print, this font is supposed to do it on screen. From what I have gathered
  so far, this is possible with OpenType-fonts as they allow the inclusion of Python
  scripts. These in turn can manipulate glyph outlines, positioning, etc.\r\n\r\nI
  have no idea how to script Python. And while I do have some experience with actionscripting
  in Flash and the syntax is pretty similar, what I need here is way beyond the scope
  of my skills. First, let me show you what I mean to do:\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Generating
  random glyph outlines by interpolation of several \"Master Phases\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_01_6354.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  1: The master phases, shown with very little variance here. This will effect on
  the degree of \"mutation\" the interpolation will output. Compare Fig. 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_02_4927.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  2: Master phases, with more variance between the glyphs this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_03_4911.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  3: The master phases, overlayed. The blue areas show the boundaries of of movement
  the interpolation has for placing the nodes. The green areas stand for the possible
  positions of the handles. These polygons are created by the x/y-coordinates of the
  respective points in the master phases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_04_4618.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  4: This figure demonstrates why four master phases are in use. Interpolation requires,
  naturally, a minimum of two phases. If more than two are used however, the degree
  of possible variations multiplies. This also enables a better simulation of variation
  within characters that ahndwriting would produce as body machanics and the flow
  of writing influence the appearance of characters in writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_05_3904.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  5: Variation is even more noticeable when more differently styled masters are used.
  Enjoyably, the interpolated phases are very consistent in style, so even though
  a degree of randomness is introduced into the character outlines, they still look
  like they belong together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_06_4549.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  6: Masters and interpolated characters in a row (low variance).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_1_07_5721.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  7: Masters and interpolated characters in a row (high variance).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_2_01_6100.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  8: The introduction of two additional parameters that randomly rotate and scale
  one out of five characters are supposed to further simulate the changing angles
  of strokes in handwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Expanding the basic lines
  with tools to true outlines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_2_02_4800.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  9: Now that the characteres base strokes are randomized, they get expanded by a
  \"tooltip\" which is a geomtrical shape\u2013although more complex shapes would
  also be concievable\u2013that is applied over the length of the path. \r\nIn this
  stage, the tooltip is still static, I am however considering adding another parameter
  to its rotation to make it react to changes in the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_3_01_6412.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  10: After the base strokes are expanded, terminators that simulate the dynamics
  of starting/ending a stroke and the slight bleeding that occurs when the writing
  tool rest on or is pulled away from a surface.\r\nAs of now, the method in creating
  these is rather primitve, taking the last position of the tool applied to the outline,
  moving a copy of this along the direction of the path, rotating an scaling it and
  the connect the extrema of those two shapes.\r\nThis will change though, as soon
  as I can find a method for doing so.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Altering the baseline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Randomization_3_04_4639.png]\r\n\r\nFig
  11: The circular movement of the wrist when writing left to right results in the
  lines moving slightly upward until the hand is moved to the right for an easier
  writing position. To encorparate this effect, the first character of the first syllable
  is moved slightly below the baseline and a random character between 10-15 characters
  to the right is chosen and has its baseline lifted. The positions of the characters
  in between those extrema are interpolated in non-linear fashion, resulting in a
  slight curvature of the baseline. \r\nI am still working on the selection criteria,
  so they remain subject to change.\r\nStill I would like the frequency and amplitude
  of the basline undulation to be controllable factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far this is
  what I would like to. Which leads me to the problem of how to do it.\r\nIs what
  I have cooked up here possible in Python? Has anybody tried to implement this before?
  Do you know of anybody who would like to collaborate in such a project or can be
  hired for it? Your help would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is through <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/TTOCHAP1.htm\">GSUB
    and GPOS lookups</a>."

  body: "Stephen: I tried, but I can't get through to him mailwise. He is probably
    busy with his own work right now.\r\n\r\nMiguel: Whew, you scared me there for
    a second.\r\nhttp://www.robofab.org/index.html\r\nIf you follow this link here,
    \r\n\r\nyou'll arrive at the RoboFab page. \r\n\r\nRoboFab is a little plugin
    that works with FontLab and allows manipulation of glyph segments via Python script.
    It also allows the usage of what I called \"tooltips\" in my descriptions, only
    that they are called pens, but the idea remains the same.\r\n\r\nRoboFab saves
    data in its very own file format called UFO (Unified Font Object) which is pretty
    neat as it is XML-based and can be read without an editor. It exports fonts into
    every format that is supported by FontLab.\r\n\r\nI thought that the Python scripts
    you write for RoboFab would somehow get included into the font file and be run
    when the font is in use. Maybe, this was a misunderstanding and the scripts are
    only executed <em>before</em> the font is generated and the font afterwards becomes
    just a normal font with all the usual limitations.\r\n\r\nI will check on that,
    but this will require some time.\r\n\r\nIf in the meantime you come up with any
    other ideas, please let me have them. "

    that you've started this thread on your blog area. Have you had started it on
    the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/6\">Build forum</a>, and I'm sure it
    would have contributions from other people as the topic is very interesting. I
    had a hard time finding it again this time around, for example.\r\n\r\nThe moderators
    usually move threads to other forums if it seems appropriate, but I'm told that
    they can't do that with personal blog threads."

  body: "Since RoboFab applies the Python scripts before the font is rendered, you
    could try a \"hack\" approach by using something like PHP to vary the CSS stylings
    of a web page. In this case, the your font would have to be installed on the reader's
    computer. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you could try using PHP to call a random image from
    a specified folder (a folder containing your variations of the \"C\" character,
    for example.\r\n\r\nAlthough the former approach would be easier, the latter wouldn't
    be overwhelming -- you'd just have to specify a randomization for each character
    you wanted to use. It wouldn't be all that hard."

    for screen display at best. \r\n\r\nWhat really vexes me most is, that even with
    this approach there is no possibility of making the randomness happen at runtime.
    I would just be retrieving images from a pre-made set. Which in a way is what
    I am doing right now with the flipper font.\r\n\r\nI can post some results in
