body: In the currently running thread ostensibly about &#39;New MS Type for 2006&#39;,
  but seemingly about grinding some rather ancient axes, a lot of stuff has been written
  about Microsoft&#39;s new ClearType Font Collection, almost all of if by people
  who have never used the fonts, have no access to tools that would allow them to
  test the fonts under the rendering system for which they were designed, and have
  apparently only seen screenshots on a third-party website. <BR> <BR>In this thread,
  with the exception of this introductory text, I do not intend to write very much.
  Rather, I will post, as my schedule permits, images that will give a better idea
  of some of the CT fonts in use in the environment for which they were designed.
  I should stress that even these images give a poor idea of how well the fonts perform,
  unless you happen to have an identical monitor to mine and like your CT rendering
  tuned the way I like mine tuned. I suspect that most of you will have a lower resolution
  screen than mine, so the graphics will appear larger on your screens than on mine.
  This means, among other things, that the colour fringing of the CT rendering will
  be more obvious on your screen than mine, since the individual pixels are larger.
  I will include some absolute measurement, e.g. width of graphic in millimetres on
  my screen, in the caption of each graphic. [Note, the captions of graphics may be
  set in Photoshop, as in the first image, so will not themselves be examples of CT
  rendering.] <BR> <BR>I will not take part in any thread to which Bill Troop contributes,
  so hopefully he won&#39;t kill this thread by voicing opinions here. If he wants
  to continue slagging fonts and the people who make them, he can do so in the other
  thread to his heart&#39;s content. Everyone else is encouraged to ask questions
  that I can try to answer visually. If there are particular kinds of settings you
  would like to see, particular type sizes, background colours, etc., please let me
  know. I hope the images will be helpful to making up your own mind about these fonts,
  but I maintain that the real time to judge these fonts will be when Longhorn ships
  and people actually start using them. <BR> <BR>One final note, where I label an
  image as &#39;Longhorn CT rendering&#39; this is actually output from a test app
  using the Longhorn APIs running under Windows XP. This test app does not, currently,
  employ the y-direction antialiasing of the Longhorn renderer, so I will limit such
  examples to typical text sizes. I can post some display size examples from another
  test application, but this will not show sub-pixel positioning. <BR> <BR> <BR>PS.
  If nothing else, this thread might convince some people of the near impossibility
  of forming a valuable judgement of screen typography via screenshots. I just looked
  at the images below on a 96dpi screen, and they look worse than I feared. Live text
  on your own screen is the only way to judge these things at all well, and even then
  you are likely to learn as much about the limitations of your screen as you are
  about the qualities of the type.

    the state of the art for b/w screen rendering, so I&#39;m starting the visuals
    with a comparison of Georgia and Constantia in two different CT rendering environments,
    to show how the state of the art for b/w rendering is not necessarily ideally
    suited to the new rendering systems. This is primarily a comparison of a font

    uses subpixel spacing, so if you look at other T&#39;s &#40;like the T in Everson
    Typography&#41; you&#39;ll see that the bitmap pattern is different. In the XP

  body: 'Some informal observations: <BR> <BR>The biggest difference I can see in
    the way CT renders text compared to OSX &#40;Panther&#41; is in the way horizontal
    elements are rendered.  <BR> <BR>On both CT and OSX with sub-pixel smoothing on
    &#40;&#34;Best for LCD&#34;&#41;, vertical elements are rendered using sub-pixel
    rendering.  <BR> <BR>With CT, horizontal elements are pixel-aligned, just like
    non-antialiased type. This leads to a bit of jaggy-ness in strokes that are close
    to horizontal, like the middle of the lowercase s in the examples John provided.
    The most noticeable difference in the Longhorn example is the addition of sub-pixel
    spacing, as Si noted. <BR> <BR>With OSX, horizontal elements are antialised the
    conventional way, using varying shades of gray. This leads to smoother glyph shapes,
    even in slightly horizontal elements, but also a certain degree of fuzziness with
    some fonts at some sizes. OSX also appears to use sub-pixel spacing because the
    glyph patterns vary in the same way as the Longhorn CT example. <BR> <BR>To my
    eye, CT renders text more crisply with some distortion of the glyph shapes, while
    OSX renders text with more even color and less distortion at the expense of crispness.  <BR>
    <BR>They both look good to me, but for different reasons. I don&#39;t know which
    would be best for reading.'

  body: 'The Longhorn renderer can apply y-direction antialiasing to smooth horizontals,
    but this would normally only be turned on as the type size increases &#40;this
    is design specific: MS have defined a new GASP table format so that font developers
    can set the sizes at which y-direction antialiasing kicks in&#41;. Y-direction
    antialiasing makes display type look excellent, but as in the OSX display, it
    reduces contrast and crispness at small sizes. One thing that pretty much all
    legibility/readability research agrees on is that contrast is key to reading.'

  body: Thanks, John, for these marvellous specimens. I am just blown over by how
    much more readable Verdana is than anything else you have shown. You have really
    helped me deepen my appreciation of Verdana. In the past, I believe I have muttered
    some words to the effect of &#39;oh, Verdana, nothing special, anyone who has
    ever seen a 4-1/2 point news sans could have done it.&#39; And I have also said
    that Verdana was the world&#39;s ugliest sans serif, even if it was also the world&#39;s
    most functional. Well, I take that all back. Verdana is a miracle of legibility,
    and in massed type, as you have set it here, I must to my utter astonishment admit
    that I actually find it almost heartbreakingly beautiful. Now those are words
    I thought I would never utter!  <BR> <BR>Again, with Georgia. You really help
    me see why it is so much more readable than the comparison fonts. Carter is really
    much better than even I thought he was. <BR> <BR>Great job!

  body: 'This is a fascinating display. It is immediately clear that Verdana, in either
    rendering system, looks better than the other sans serifs. It is less obvious
    why Georgia, again in either rendering system, is superior. Very generally I would
    suggest that it is a matter of the proportions - - the proportions and weight
    of each letter individually, and each in relation to its neighbour, the perfect
    judgment of the serifs, which really do aid readability, and the well-judged x-height.
    What I find particularly remarkable is that when magnified even a little, one
    sees that the rendering of the newer fonts is better in some respects than for
    Georgia. Yet there is something so sturdy and functional about the shapes of Georgia
    that even at its worst, it easily emerges as the most readable. How on earth did
    he do it? <BR> <BR>One thing I am curious about is that so many of the new fonts
    seem to be somewhat compressed. Traditional wisdom has it that this impedes readability,
    and I am with traditional wisdom here. But was there a practical reason to make
    the new fonts slightly compressed? <BR> <BR>I notice also with interest that few
    of the numbers in the new fonts seem happy. Some are too small, others have too
    much ascender and descender play, few seem just right in relation to text, although
    they might look fine on their own. Were they tested in text?  <BR> <BR>Do please
    post some more. It would be nice to see Meiryo Latin, and it would be lovely to
    see Georgia in one of the narrower columns of continuous text such as the one
    directly above. <BR> <BR>it would also be great to see some larger text samples
    and perhaps a few fitting tests. <BR> <BR>Oh, and a question: you write, &#34;I
    suspect that most of you will have a lower resolution screen than mine, so the
    graphics will appear larger on your screens than on mine.&#34; <BR> <BR>Could
    you tell us what your resolution is? Is it some special kind of monitor that can&#39;t
    be generally bought? And what are your preferred CT settings? What I&#39;m getting
    at is, if you&#39;re going to say that the particular equipment you use when viewing
    these pages is important, than you ought to specify the equipment. That way some
    of us might be able to view the material under optimum conditions. I would expect
    that everyone reading this has some kind of reasonable minimum as regards equipment,
    but perhaps I am naive?'

  body: 'Bill, see my response in the &#39;CT and the future&#39; thread re. Verdana
    and Georgia. <BR> <BR>[I&#39;m sitting here -- unable to sleep as it happens --
    wondering if it is possible that we might actually have a civil discussion. I
    would like that.] <BR> <BR>I think the new CT fonts might <i>seem</i> compressed
    because they&#39;re not what we&#39;ve become used to in &#39;screen fonts&#39;.
    With the exception of Calibri, which I think of primarily as a subhead type, they&#39;re
    actually not compressed in terms of the norms of print typography. Candara is
    very generously proportioned, and Corbel and Constantia are both quite typical
    in width for sans and serif text types. ClearType reduces the gap between screen
    and print, and as it and monitor resolutions improve the gap will be further reduced.
    Unlike some of the people at MS, I&#39;m not convinced that reading on screen
    will ever be as comfortable as reading print &#40;presuming similar levels of
    relative quality -- there is some printing that is decidedly worse than text on
    screen!&#41;, but I do think that ClearType brings the conventions of screen and
    print typography closer together. Yes, after using Georgia and Verdana in every
    screen reading situation for so long because they were the only option, most other
    fonts are going to seem compressed at first. <BR> <BR>Yes, numerals were tested
    in text. I have a theory about numbers on screen, based on the fact that we don&#39;t
    actually read numbers in the same sense that we read text &#40;except perhaps
    commonly recurring numbers such as dates from recent years&#41;. I suspect that
    we notice the compromises of low resolution more consciously in numerals than
    in letters forming words. <BR> <BR>By the way, the new CT fonts all contain at
    least four different numeral styles &#40;not counting superscript and subscript&#41;:
    proportional oldstyle, proportional lining, tabular oldstyle and tabular lining,
    and some of the families also include smallcap lining numerals. MS decided that
    the proportional oldstyle figures would be the default for all the families except
    Cambria &#40;the latter is intended things like for business documents, in which
    tabular lining is likely to be expected as default&#41;. <BR> <BR>I will try to
    find some time to post more graphics in the next few days. If you let me know
    what kind of things you would like to see in a fitting text, I can see what I
    can do. Making the graphics with my test tools is time consuming, because I can&#39;t
    show multiple sizes or styles at the same time, so have to cobble the graphics
    together. <BR> <BR>Regarding my monitor, as I noted in the caption for the first
    graphic, my display is 146ppi. This is a 15&#34; widescreen Dell laptop display,
    running 1900 x 1200 pixels. So I have a pixel pitch of about 0.1725mm. As far
    as I know, it is the best display this side of the IBM 200ppi monitor. <BR> <BR>I
    have another laptop that I use when I&#39;m travelling because it is very small
    and light, but it only has about a 105ppi screen and it is very difficult to go
    from reading ClearType on my Dell to reading it on the lower resolution screen.
    For some tasks, I turn ClearType off on the smaller machine and use b/w rendering
    instead. ClearType really comes into its own around 130ppi: that&#39;s the &#39;sweet
    spot&#39; at which, even at text sizes, design details like serif form start to
    become distinguishable and the individual identity of typefaces start to assert
    themselves.'

  body: This is great, thanks very much. At first glance I see nothing alarmingly
    irregular in this &#40;the Calibri spacing&#41;, although I could &#40;and in
    fact do&#41; quarrel with the underlying parameters, but that is another issue.
    This makes me suspect that there really _is_ something fantastically wrong with
    the Poynter showing. I should have the book soon, anyway. But ... if the Poynter
    setting is an accurate representation of the book &#40;and I see no reason to
    suppose that it is not&#41; and if the book, therefore, has some really awful
    spacing, the question arises, how on earth did it get there? Is it even remotely
    possible that the book was set with InDesign, with the optical kerning settings
    on? And could they have caused these problems? Just last week, finally, after
    all these years, I actually tested InDesign CS for an article. &#40;Surely, John,
    you will be glad that I have done this, as you have been asking me to do it since
    at least the end of 1999!&#41; I discovered some rather alarming things about
    the optical kerning - far worse than anything even I ever suspected. Could that
    be the problem? Or, could some designer have done some hand kerning that was hopelessly
    misguided? Such things, after all, do happen! Needless to say, it&#39;s MS that
    ought to be finding out the answers to these questions, not me! But let me get
    on with my measurements. Too bad I don&#39;t have the fonts! I should hate to
    have to go abegging to the ACT for them!

    book use InDesign&#39;s optical kerning along with tracking, since the goal in
    this is simply to ensure that all letters are reasonably evenly spaced, including
    conbinations that occur in such showings but not in text so might not be kerned
    in the font. But none of the other showings of the fonts in the book should be
    optically kerned. If they were, it would be an error, and I&#39;m sure I would
    have heard about it from Luc&#40;as&#41;, because he is very particular about
    his spacing, as anyone who has seen his &#39;Kernologica&#39; presentation knows.

  body: In the <i>Now read this</i> book there is only a very small, three line comparison
    of Verdana and Meiryo, but the most obvious thing about it is that Meiryo is more
    space-efficient than Verdana. I was wondering how much more efficient, so prepared
    this illustration. The strings of letters in this image represent the relative
    frequency of lowercase letters occuring in an English text of 34,643 words; I&#39;ve
    compared this to frequencies in other, somewhat smaller samples &#40;c. 10,000
    words&#41; to confirm that it is similar or identical to what you could expect
    in other texts. The only distortion in the frequencies is the q, which was rounded
    up to 1 from .3 in order to ensure that at least one instance of every letter
    appeared in the sequence. <BR> <BR>To assist comparison, I have reduced the linespacing

  body: 'Most interesting images. I hate to be so perverse, but I don&#39;t think
    I like Meiryo as much as Verdana. However, I&#39;ve only looked at these images,
    briefly, on the Mac, on two monitors, 1600x1200, colour and greyscale &#40;which
    remains I must say sharper than anything else I&#39;ve ever seen&#41;. I&#39;ll
    look on the PC later. Speaking of which, I have exactly the same Dell screen you
    specified. Does it make any difference what browser is used? How should ClearType
    be set up? And are there any other desired parameters? I wouldn&#39;t want to
    make some silly mistake in some setting that would invalidate the view. <BR> <BR>But
    before anything else, and just based on the quickest glance, I am coming to wonder
    the following: I am not at all sure I like the new proportions of Meiryo &#40;considered
    not at all as a companion to Japanese, but simply as an alternate Latin to Verdana
    - that is of course a wrong consideration, but let it stand for the sake of argument&#41;,
    and I know I don&#39;t like many of the proportions &#40;x, desc, asc, cap height&#41;
    of the new CTs. So: is there a technical reason for these proportions? Or was
    there some research which suggested these proportions as desirable and which was
    incorporated into the design briefs? I suspect I&#39;m on the wrong track here,
    but I do wonder. <BR> <BR>Speaking of the design briefs, that is helpful background,
    and there is much to respond to in that and other areas when time allows. <BR>
    <BR>Finally, I find myself uncomfortable with the new default line spacings, which
    I find too generous. I wonder the following: are the new line spacings calculated
    to improve comprehension of every word? If so, is it possible that they impede
    rapid skimming? My point being that I don&#39;t actually want, on screen, in many
    cases, to read every word of text before me as I haven&#39;t the time. I want
    to be able to glance at the entire paragraph and take away as much information
    as I can in a couple of seconds. For this purpose, I would suggest that tighter
    default line spacing might be more helpful.'

  body: Okay, one last post, and then I&#39;m going to sleep. <BR> <BR>Since you&#39;re
    looking at screenshots rather than live rendering, it doesn&#39;t matter how you
    have your ClearType tuned. What you are seeing is how I have <i>my</i> ClearType
    tuned. You should be able to make a direct comparison of live Georgia rendering
    on your own screen to the first image above if you do want to compare tuning.
    Be sure to compare to the WinXP rendering in the image, not the Longhorn. The
    background colour of the above images is R255,G255,B220. <BR> <BR>The proportions
    of the new types was not technically determined, no. The horizontal proportions
    were left to the discretion of the designers. Since the new CT renderer allows
    glyph boundaries to fall on subpixels, there isn&#39;t a technical need to conform
    to something approximating full pixel widths as there was for Georgia and Verdana.
    As I wrote previously, I think part of your reaction to the proportions of the
    new types might be that you are so used to the wideness of Verdana and Georgia
    in on screen reading. I&#39;d be interested to know, in a couple of years, after
    you&#39;ve had a chance to live with the new types for a few months, whether you
    still dislike their proportions. <BR> <BR>Regarding the linespacing, the idea
    was that the <i>default</i> linespacing should be similar to that which one would
    use e.g. in a book for a text column of typical length according to the canons
    of traditional typography. I don&#39;t think one can make assumptions about how
    people want to read text on screen. Yes, there is probably more skimming on screen
    than in print, simply because of the quantity of information presented, but I
    think it would be a mistake to set default vertical metrics in a font based on
    this. And, as I say, this is only the default spacing, employed where there is
    no human intervention in the linespacing. You can always increase or reduce the
    linespacing as appropriate to particular text using CSS. <BR> <BR>Goodnight.

    <BR>If the spacing did vary, it could only vary by a subpixel, but I think there
    is a spacing illusion caused by the variation in the glyph rendering that may
    account for what you are seeing. If you look at the close-up from the Meiryo in
    post number 1857, below, you will see that the spacing of touched sub-pixels is
    actually very regular indeed, but the colour density of those touched pixels varies,
    making some glyphs look lighter on one side or the other. I think this can create

    alt="Meiryo subpixel close-up"> <BR> <BR>The question of rhythm is an interesting
    one in regard to screen typography, because although it is possible to create
    very regular intervals of verticals in b/w bitmap rendering -- and this was a
    major goal of most of the hinting that has been done in the past decade and a
    bit -- this is done at the expense of that interplay of rhythm and form that we
    prize in good text faces for print. So, for example, the subtle reduction in the
    widths of the bowls of a lowercase <i>m</i> relative to that of the <i>n</i> is
    abandoned in b/w screen rendering in favour of total regularity in the spacing
    of verticals. Is this really typographic rhythm? Or is it a mechanically determined
    simulacrum? The rhythm of a well hinted font in a b/w display, compared to the
    rhythm of even the same typeface in print &#40;Verdana is a good example, despite
    being designed around bitmaps: Matthew has put into the design as much subtlety
    of rhythm as he could, which is only evident in print&#41;, is a bit like the
    rhythm of a drum machine compared to Buddy Rich. <BR> <BR>The promise of sub-pixel
    rendering and positioning -- only just beginning to be delivered on the higher
    resolution screens, in my opinion -- is that the subtleties of typographic rhythm,
    i.e. rhythm as it relates to form and not merely to regularity, can be deployed
    on screen as it is in print. &#40;although obviously not to the same degree of
    refinement&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think at the moment, we&#39;re in an awkward position
    where the technology of screen displays is in transition, and we can no longer
    optimise type for a presumed level or type of display, as we could when MS commissioned
    Georgia and Verdana. ClearType is in part an anticipatory technology. This is
    also true to some degree of the new CT fonts; there are details in Constantia,
    for example, which probably won&#39;t be evident on screen, except at very large
    sizes, for several years, but they are based on the direction of development of
    both the CT renderer and screen resolution.'

    a single subpixel increase in space between the touched subpixels of the 2nd and
    3rd <i>i</i> and between the 5th and 6th. But this is because the stems of the
    3rd and 6th <i>i</i> appear to be one subpixel narrower than the others. This
    confirms my suspicion that the actual spacing is regular -- in terms of the advanced
    widths of the glyphs falling on regular subpixel boundaries --, but there is an
    illusion of spacing variation based on the variation in stem rendering. <BR> <BR>At
    this point in the conversation, it would probably be helpful to hear from Mike

  body: 'Bill: if you want to control the space between letters with subpixel accuracy,
    then the relative offset of the glyph with respect to the pixel grid will have
    different subpixel values for different renderings. Otherwise, you&#39;re forced
    to quantize to whole-pixel space values, which can be ok if the spacing of the
    font is carefully tuned to screen resolutions, but can also be a serious problem
    for WYSIWYG rendering. <BR> <BR>The basic antialiasing algorithm is to render
    the glyph at a higher resolution in monochrome &#40;say 400 dpi for a 100 dpi
    rendering&#41;, then count the number of &#34;on&#34; pixels within each 4x4 cell.
    If you offset the pixel by 1/4 increments, that corresponds to offsetting the
    high-resolution rendering by 1 pixel increments before doing the subsampling,
    which is all pretty straightforward. &#40;Adobe uses 4x4 subsamping and 1/4 pixel
    subpixel positioning accuracy in their font renderer that ships with Acrobat;
    Apple does something a little different which results in even higher precision&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Doing grayscale subpixel offset to a stem aligned to the pixel grid &#40;as
    the result of hinting, perhaps&#41; reduces contrast. If the high res rendering
    is ####____, and you subsample by 4, then you get #_, which is quite crisp. Move
    two pixels to the right, so that the high res is __####__, and the subsampled
    version has two pixels of 1/2 intensity. <BR> <BR>With ClearType, subpixel positioning
    has much less of an effect on contrast, because of the subpixel LCD addressing.
    A stem which is rendered as RGB___ and shifted 1/3 pixel to the right turns into
    _GBR__, which visually looks almost the same. &#40;I believe Adobe uses 1/3 pixel
    subpixel positining increments in their CoolType implementation&#41;. Even if
    you shift by 1/2 pixel, you get _gBRg_, which is a lot better than the grayscale
    case. <BR> <BR>As far as I know, there is no patent protection on basic subpixel
    positioning in antialiased text &#40;I know AA text itself goes back well over
    20 years&#41;. MS, of course, has a sheaf of patents on their ClearType implementation,
    but it is unclear to me whether those cover the basic concept of LCD subpixel
    rendering, or just their specific implementation. If the latter, then Apple &#40;with
    their &#34;font smoothing&#34;&#41; and Adobe &#40;with CoolType&#41; don&#39;t
    have anything to fear in the patent department. <BR> <BR>As for other competing
    systems, you might be interested in my <a href="http://artofcode.com/fontfocus/">FontFocus</a>,
    which does <i>not</i> use LCD subpixelling, but does a much better job of preserving
    spacing than techniques based on quantizing to pixel coordinates. I am finding,
    incidentally, very little interest in the technology, so it&#39;s not clear I&#39;m
    going to keep working on it &#40;even though I do have a few more ideas on how

    edge falls on an RG GB or BR subpixel boundary. That will determine across which
    subpixels the whole stem will fall, and hence what colours need to be dealt with.
    See page 13 of <i>Now read this</i>, which explains the principle and purpose
    of subpixel positioning. <BR> <BR>Note that this is particular to the new, Longhorn
    version of the CT renderer. The version you have on WinXP always renders each

    for the designs involved sending test glyphs for hinting, to test rendering under
    ClearType. My own design went through two rounds of weight testing, with five
    variant stem weights. Decisions about details were informed by the kind of forms
    that ClearType renders particularly well, and avoiding as much as possible the
    kind of shallow horizontal diagonals that look jagged under ClearType. I also
    conducted a series of tests to determine the best italic angle for Constantia&#39;s
    forms under ClearType. <BR> <BR>The designs do address the unique qualities of
    ClearType. What they do not do, unlike the Base types for example, is to fetishise
    the technology stylistically. <BR> <BR>Refer also to my explanation of the design
    briefs in the other thread: the types need to look good in print as well as being
    readable on screen, because they are intended for areas of use that include both
    print and screen.'

    of a series of type designs, because the designer doesn&#39;t have control over
    the design anyway, because the new rasterizer for which the types have been developed
    will render them in dozens of different ways on the screen? Is that the basic
    point?  <BR> <BR>Well, so it is. That raises the question, at what point does
    this make any perceptible difference in the real world? Isn&#39;t that part of
    the science of CT, that artefacts will not be perceptible? I suppose there is
    the possibility that the studies are all wrong, and the artefacts will actually
    result in subliminal viewing fatigue, but that seems far-fetched. <BR> <BR>A problem,
    I now see, with John&#39;s images, is that they are, in fact, images, and can
    thus be enlarged and substantial defects revealed. <BR> <BR>But so what? If you
    enlarge a photo too much, and put your nose right to the print, the grain will
    be too large and you won&#39;t see anything. But if the normal viewing distance
    is respected, everything looks sharp and artefact-free. <BR> <BR>The same applies
    here. When we are looking at real CT onscreen, will we really be able to tell
    that characters are non-uniformly rasterized and that spacing is subliminally
    irregular? And if we enlarge the type onscreen, won&#39;t such artefacts decrease,
    not increase? I mean, the type is scalable, so artefacts should be less and less
    obvious as size increases. &#40;The exact opposite happens with John&#39;s images,
    since they are images of type, not actual type. I hope this is clear to everyone
    - it is the nature of the bitmapped image versus the nature of scalable type.&#41;
    I say that I expect CT artefacts to decrease as size increases, and I do, but
    will that really happen? <BR> <BR>Re increasing the density of the dot of the
    i, may I play devils advocate and ask if there isn&#39;t a point, in a high x-height

    the CTC types render on older screens using older versions of Windows?  <BR> <BR>And
    should we be worrying about that? Isn&#39;t the whole point of these types that
    they are not recommended for webpages? <BR> <BR>What interests me more is the
    hint of a closed, proprietary nature of the type system - a holy grail that the
    type industry has been searching for ever since the unfortunate invention of PS
    and TT. <BR> <BR>How does CT-style rendering contrast with Cool Type and Quartz
    when used with older CRTs? <BR> <BR>Mais je divague. I don&#39;t want to lose
    track of my question: we have established that CT will render 7 consecutive i&#39;s
    in 7 different ways. But we also know that we will never normally have to view
    a text stream of 7 consecutive i&#39;s. However, the point is has been made: strokes
    are rendered differently, according to their position on the screen vis-a-vis
    subpixel positioning. What do we gain from this? What do we lose?  <BR> <BR>And
    another question: what is the processing overhead for CT? We know it is turned
    off by default in XP, but why? Turning off a great new feature by default is always
    a mistake, as GX showed. So what&#39;s the problem with CT that mandated this
    counterintuitive situation?'

  body: 'Greg Hitchcock at Microsoft responds regarding the rendering width variation
    noted above. <BR> <BR>Short answer: <BR><i>From a scan conversion point of view,
    we break each pixel down into six parts--two parts per sub-pixel. If we were trying
    to display a feature that was one pixel wide and aligned on the pixel boundary,
    it would take three sub-pixels to represent that. If we were to take that same
    one pixel wide feature, and instead shift it one half of one sub-pixel in &#40;one
    part of the six&#41; then it would take up the three sub-pixels of the pixel plus
    an additional sub-pixel to the right, for a total of four sub-pixels. Of course
    the edge sub-pixels are grayed to represent this spatial shift.</i> <BR> <BR>Extended
    answer: <BR><i>Scan conversion is the process of turning a vector representation
    into a bitmap representation. The scan conversion rule we use in TrueType is if
    the center of the pixel &#40;or a virtual pixel in the case of anti-aliasing&#41;
    falls on the interior of a closed outline, then that pixel will be turned &#34;on.&#34;
    In the case of a virtual pixel, you could imagine taking a real pixel, and breaking
    it into fourths &#40;2x2&#41;. Then using the scan conversion algorithm, you figure
    out how many of the virtual pixel centers are in the interior of the outline.
    If for example the outline included two of the four virtual pixels, then the true
    pixel would be assigned a gray level of 2/4ths. This method is called a box filter.
    There are other weighted techniques that can be used, but the box filter is easy
    to implement and fairly easy to explain. <BR> <BR>Why did we choose six instead
    of three? To be clear, we&#39;re just talking along the horizontal axis here.
    Three would be very straight forward, each sub-pixel becomes one pixel. But we
    felt that we got better detail by breaking each sub-pixel up into two virtual
    sub-pixels--without the typical loss of contrast caused by full pixel anti-aliasing.
    We did many experiments in this area. Some of our algorithms broke the full pixel
    into 40 different parts, and we asymmetrically assigned weights to the colored
    sub-pixels proportionally based on the eye&#39;s ability to perceive color detail
    &#40;e.g. 60% green, 30% red, and 10% blue&#41;. In some of the different tunings
    available for ClearType, these options can be selected. Ultimately, we felt that
    two virtual pixels per sub-pixel worked well, and was efficient to implement.
    I should also note that the ClearType algorithms, as part of the color perception
    reduction technique, have a bleed of one sub-pixel to the right and one sub-pixel
    to the left of the feature. This bleed is usually quite small, but it is there.</i>'

  body: 'I want to start with a letterpress perspective inspired by the thread on
    the new Bembo, where we were discussing the fact that, taking a given line of
    metal type, weight and spacing may vary within acceptable limits by 30% &#40;at
    least&#41; according to how the line is printed. &#40;If you consider that 30%
    gain in a character has a 60% effect on space anytime two letters are adjacent,
    you will see why I consider this important for spacing.&#41;  <BR> <BR>More important
    here is the fact that in all practical letterpress printing, stem widths of individual
    letters can vary largely, depending on a thousand unpredictable mechanical factors.
    <BR> <BR>So: Relating the issue of variable stem widths in CT2 to letterpress,
    I simply cannot get upset about variable stem widths in ClearType. I realize this
    is anathema to most digital era designers. But once you have really examined a
    lot of great letterpress printing under magnification, and have seen how profoundly
    stem widths routinely vary there, and how little it seems to matter, it just doesn&#39;t
    seem that important that the CT rasterizer will here and there alter shapes of
    letters. The attempt to weed irrationality out of type rasterization seems to
    me as pointless as Einstein spending the last 30 years of his life trying to disprove
    his theory of quantum mechanics. &#40;For a convenient summary, see &#39;One Hundred
    Years of Uncertainty&#39;, Brian Greene, New York Times Apr 8, 2005, p. A27.&#41;
    For Einstein&#39;s credo, &#39;God does not play dice with the Universe&#39; simply
    replace the type designer&#39;s &#39;God does not play dice with stem widths&#39;.
    Unfortunately, both for Einstein and for rigid typophiles, it seems that God does
    sometimes gamble.  <BR> <BR>OK, we now have the general idea that the CT rasterizer
    has now reached the point that it prints to the screen with some quanta of irrationality,
    just as letterpress prints to the page with some somewhat similar quanta of irrationality.
    This should not disturb anyone here, except the Einsteins of Type, who, I hear,
    have temporarily gone missing in Beruit. Would that they might solidify in that
    state! Alas, quantum mechanics informs us that they are all too likely not to.
    <BR> <BR>Our job here, now that we have got the philosophical and theoretical
    generalities out of the way, is to examine the particularities of the system under
    review. What are the gains of variability here? What are the losses? To what extent
    do the scores we come up with vary depending on the quality of the hardware, in
    this case the LCD? To what extent can we say that LCD quality can be indexed grossly
    but effectively by considering only top resolution capability? What are other
    variables in LCD quality that would negate such a gross index? <BR> <BR>Has anyone
    considered the grotesque extent to which fixed resolution LCDs are routinely set
    to lower resolutions, with ghastly results? Should OSs not contain warning messages
    about such problems? <BR> <BR>David has pointed out that CT does not interrogate
    the system for dpi. Isn&#39;t this a big mistake? How can this system work unless
    the OS takes some steps to insure that the user has set up his display hardware
    optimally? The OS certainly has this capability. Here is a display system that
    will, if something isn&#39;t done, be routinely wrecked by a huge proportion of
    users, who will take 1600x1200 LCDs and set the resolution to 800x600, just because
    &#39;the type seems to small.&#39; How do we intelligently deal with this challenge
    if the OS does not take intelligent control of all the relevant parameters? We
    must consider that most users do not know even how to use the zoom control in
    MS Word. <BR> <BR>My very preliminary judgement is that Microsoft has done a phenomenal
    job of dealing with most of the issues of variability at hand. Of course I could
    be quite wrong - perhaps I overestimate the brilliance of the CT engineers. I
    simply don&#39;t have the background to judge and hope that others with more perspective
    and deeper knowledge will be able to elucidate. Nevertheless, it seems to me that
    a large technological step forward has been taken here, though it may not be quite
    as unique as I at first thought. We have not had enough input from others working
    with this technology. <BR> <BR>That said, I can see only two issues raised so
    far that need work, none of it, unfortunately easy. <BR> <BR>I think my point
    that considerable aesthetic and technical review of the new typefaces needs to
    be undertaken, is valid. <BR> <BR>I think David&#39;s point that the OS must know
    exactly what hardware it is dealing with, screen resolution being the first essential
    piece of knowledge but certainly not the last, is valid. <BR> <BR>It would be
    ridiculous to assume that I have somehow got the priorities right. This is only
    my individual perspective. It would be nice if some bright people would contribute
    some new thoughts and critiques, unlikely &#40;even from the viewpoint of quantum
    mechanics&#41; though that may seem.'

  body: Thomas, I didn&#39;t realize that 1600x1200 to 800x600 was a particularly
    drastic case. However, I think it will become a common one. In two or three years,
    16x12 will probably be a kind of norm, and you will have a lot of users - those
    who could most benefit from CT if only they knew how - switching to 8x6.  <BR>
    <BR>You are absolutely right that the technology should not be sacrificed to lowest
    common denominator &#40;LCD!&#41; users. However, I don&#39;t think these cases
    are relatively unusual - I have seen a lot of screens that ordinary folk run lately
    and not a single LCD was set to its native res - and I do think that provision
    can and should be made to advise them how to deal with the problem. Their concern
    is for larger type. Their solution is to lower screen resolution. What has to
    be made easier is the various mechanisms that programs and OSs have for scaling
    type. This is one of the great unresolved issues of UI design. <BR> <BR>In the
    meantime, I have a peripheral question. For those of us who believe &#40;amongst
    them are DisplayMate&#39;s Ray Soneira&#41; that the very best CRTs are still
    superior to the very best LCDs, and though none of us believes that CRTs are for
    this world much longer, what is being done to make the CRT experience as good
    as possible? Or does it make any difference if you have a CRT that is roughly
    3200 x 2400 or even more?
