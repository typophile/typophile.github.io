  body: "<em>What is the difference between Quirinus and Corvinus?</em>\r\n\r\nThere
    are quite a few differences, actually. There are a number of subtle differences
    in the uppercase characters\u2014immediately obvious in the C and M\u2014and the
    lowercase characters  with ascenders in Quirinus are unserifed at the top. Alessandro
    Butti is generally more playful in his designs than Imre Reiner\u2026or, at least,
    that is my humble opinion...\r\n\r\nI should also note that Ludlow's Eden iis
    in the same ballpark, as is Stephenson Blake's Coronation, the latter being distinguished
    by its rather odd, clumsily rounded serifs."

    Maybe take a closer look at the fonts in question to see the differences. There
    also had been Mondial, Schadow and Sparta plus a bunch of single-style jobbing
    designs in that vein (eg. Radio, Rundfunk, Patria, Kontrast, Pergamon etc)."

  body: "OK, I generally use the term \u201Crevival\u201D to refer to faithful digitizations,
    rather than fonts which add cuts or styles to a family, change details, or provide
    variants, which is what Giorgio does.\r\n\r\nGiven the distinctive nature of Corvinus,
    I would say that Giogio comes within the bounds of what is generally understood
    to be a revival, although the term \u201Credesign\u201D would probably be more
    accurate.\r\n\r\nIn fact, while many redesigns/revivals meekly tone down the more
    distinctive features of their model, Giorgio not only incorporates many of the
    unique details of Corvinus, but also ramps up its fundamental qualities\u2014its
    squareness and its thin vertical serifs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Nick,\r\n\r\nI believe that the general trend to which Indra is referring is high-contrast
    letterforms, as are found in Broadway or Nubian, for instance. Reiner's unique
    contribution was to add the treatment to the vertical serifs."

    thin vertical serifs in general.\r\n\r\nWhat \u201Cdistinctive quality\u201D of
    Corvinus do you mean exactly then, Nick? As I said, there have been similar jobbing
    typefaces before the release of Corvinus in 1934, eg. Radio and Rundfunk by Berthold,
    Meridian by Klingspor, Kontrast by Weber, Eden by Ludlow, and several later, like
    Bayer-Type from Berthold, Mondial by Stempel, Candida by Ludwig & Mayer, Schadow
    by Weber, Patria from Schriftguss AG, Die Schlanke by Ludwig & Mayer, Pergamon
    by Ludwig Wagner, Quirinus, or Sparta from Genzsch & Heyse.\r\n\r\nHowever, Corvinus
    was more extensive and indeed more widely known than the others, especially outside
    of Germany. "

  body: "I\u2019m not familiar with all those faces, Indra.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t believe
    that trends de\uFB01ne typefaces, but vice versa.\r\nTrends are critical rationalizations
    of properties that are common to a sequence of type designs identi\uFB01ed by
    a critic, historian, or cultural commentator. Even if the critic recognizes a
    commonality which has not previously been articulated, it was nonetheless \uFB01rst
    created in an individual type design, and named subsequently.\r\nA typeface is
    a collection of related design themes which have been realized with synergy\u2014the
    whole concept is greater than the sum of the parts, it\u2019s an emergent quality.\r\n\r\nCorvinus
    is a type which combines:\r\n- high contrast\r\n- vertical stress\r\n- squarish
    rounds\r\n- vertical hairline serifs on blunt-ended terminals of curved strokes\r\n\r\nImre
    Reiner found a way to fuse those together into a unique design.\r\n\r\nIf Eden
    is Corvinus without the vertical thin serifs, then the question is: which came
    first?\r\nBecause it looks like one is an adaptation of the other, with or without
    those serifs.\r\n(Although they might have occured independently, but how would
    one know?)\r\n\r\nGiorgio has it both ways, with alternates.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026you
    cannot say that Imre Reiner invented high-contrast typeface with thin vertical
    serifs in general.</em>\r\n\r\nWith Nick (Curtis), I could say that he invented
    this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_srif_4177.jpg]\r\nAnd if another
    designer used that device in a squarish didone, then it would be a copy/revival/redesign
    of Corvinus."
