body: "I saw this today on Mode Visual's site and was trying to ID it. I was not able
  to find it already in a forum. It is similar to fonts like dispatch and some extended
  slab serifs like hellenic wide etc, but it is not the same as any I have seen ID'd.
  The S, R and A are a combo I have not been able to find. Any help is much appreciated,
  thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n "
