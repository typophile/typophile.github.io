  body: "Herb, thanks for pointing out the swash. \r\n\r\nI still say it's squashed
    -- look at the height of the lower-case letters in the logo, and compare with
    Bookman bold...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squash_6691.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    squashed AND swashed ;)"

  body: "The result might have been manipulated - here's a comparison with no compression
    or manipulation, just two different font sizes for upper case and lower case:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZackMiri_6202.jpg]\r\nThe
    tittle maintains its original shape (which is very slightly oval), but the tops
    of the i's and r do look flatter. The r-i ligature is cleaner in the logo, with
    the tittle appearing to be eliminated and the letterspacing changed. So I agree
    that the final image was graphically edited or manipulated, but I'm not sure how."
