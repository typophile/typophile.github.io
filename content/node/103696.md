body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nCould someone please help me identify this font? My apologies
  for the poor quality of the image but it's the best I could find. The grey around
  the letters isn't part of the font just a distortion caused by me trying to increase
  the contrast to show it better. It is a solid, serifs font. I looks a little bit
  like \"Incised 901\" fonts but this font has Serifs while Incised does not. \r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nEmma"
