    typeface designs. <BR> <BR>Not that I actually want to be right about this. The
    obligations are much too nerve racking. I&#39;m not much good at following someone
    else&#39;s rules.

    give you another hint: It had to do with the changes going on in the typesetting
    industry with the introduction of desktop publishing and the TIA was involved.'

    have to catch up with you later.

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>Well, I did respond but it never went through. Probably being
    censored now.  <BR> <BR>Zapf designed a proprietary mark for TIA which consisted
    of a capital Q in a square box. The box is tilted ninety degrees on its axis.
    The box is black the Q is white. The tail of the Q sits out side of the box and
    is black. A mark of Quality.

    attempt to hold back the tide of personal computer-based typesetting that threatened
    to wipe out the existing typesetting industry. The idea, apparently, was that
    by displaying this logo, with its subtly-curved diamond shape, typesetting outfits
    could send a defiant message of &#34;reproduce THIS if you can!&#34; to the upstarts
    which, supposedly, they couldn

  body: Nope. <BR> <BR>But it is possible you are using a variant, so I don&#39;t
    think it fair that I drag this out. My immediate source was Alison Black&#39;s
    Typefaces for desktop publishing, a user guide &#40;1990&#41;. A very good book
    by the way. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to give this to you but the words that I&#39;ve
    seen that make up the acronym are windows, icons, mouse, pointer. I verified this
    in a 1970s PARC document. WIMP is now known as GUI &#40;graphical user interface&#41;.
    It was also at one time called the WIMP GUI. There, everything you ever wanted
    to know about WIMP. <BR> <BR>All yours now. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Well, based on Rule 16 &#40;unless that has been revised&#41; I guess I can
    legally answer this. <BR> <BR>I believe this to be the DK-type.  <BR> <BR>Developed
    in Strasbourg about 1440-1444 for the printing of book-like Donatuses and Kalenders:
    The 26-line, 27-line, 28-line, and 30-line Donatuses are the earliest. The Turkenkalender
    &#40;1455&#41;, other Donatuses and other Kalenders, as well as broadsides were
    printed with it. It evolved into the face used for the 36-line Bible &#40;1458-1460&#41;,
    and others, which were printed in Albrecht Pfister&#39;s Bamberg workshop. <BR>
    <BR>The capital P here is a indicator of difference from that of the textura in
    the 42-line Bible &#40;the Gutenberg Bible&#41; of 1455/6 or the Mainz Psalter,
    1457.'

  body: Well, then, I probably should take a hint from your previous answer and say
    this is one of the French texturas of the end of the century. The French Black
    Letter used in the northwestern areas of Europe by Pynson, Hopyl, Wynkeyn de Worde,
    Caxton, etc. But I can&#39;t identify the specific face or the printer. <BR> <BR>From
    its setting, I would think it not a twentieth century revived face.

    coffee, and I can&#39;t function enough to go further with it. This one&#39;s
    a bit outside of my research interests. I&#39;d say Caxton simply because the
    needed supplementary information would be the four books. But I always preferred
    the French batarde typefaces at that point in history because it represented a
    transitional movement forward. And Caxton&#39;s use of it was sublime. So I&#39;ll
    just have to sit back on this one.

    <BR>Caxton&#39;s other lettre de forme were the Type 5 and Type 7 and Type 8.  <BR>

    works were printed in these. '
