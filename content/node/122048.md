  has the minimum printing space usage characteristics of Linden Hill but is a regular
  serif and not a slab serif.\r\n\r\nI would also like to know if it is possible to
  design fonts using a computer instead of manually drawing them on a drawing board.
  If it is, what are some good application programs to use to design fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any feedback you can provide.\r\n\r\nJim Williams"

  body: "Hi Jim, \r\nI'm afraid I don't know much about free fonts, but I can say
    that if you're looking for spatial efficiency, a small x-height is counterproductive.
    It's the printed size of the band occupied by x etc. that determines type's apparent
    size, so the smaller the x-height, the larger the point size required. \r\n\r\nOn
    Windows, most people use [[http://www.fontlab.com|FontLab Studio]] (or, for beginners,
    the same company's TypeTool) to design fonts. On Macs, [[http://www.glyphsapp.com|Glyphs]]
    has become popular. There's also the free and capable but slightly forbidding
    [[http://fontforge.github.io/en-US|FontForge]].\r\n\r\nBy the way, \"slab serif\"
    usually implies serifs that are particularly thick, not just rectangular, as in
    Linden Hill (which is really Fred Goudy's Deepdene, renamed probably for legal
    reasons)."
