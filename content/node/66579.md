    interest if one:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>runs a commercial Web site (this site is commercial;
    it solicits money and runs ads) <em>and</em></li>\r\n<li>accepts pay from a company
    that is in the same industry and is an occasional advertiser</li></ul>\r\n\r\nNone
    of the other cases listed in comments above meets those criteria. \r\n\r\nA really
    attentive reader, if there is one, which I doubt, will have noticed I did not
    set out any remedies, nor claim that the conflict of interest was (for example)
    deliberate, egregious, or untenable. Any number of options are available to rectify
    the matter. Two that aren\u2019t available are doing nothing and denying a conflict
    of interest exists."

    a couple topics *ahem* that are not contributing at all to the goals of the forum
    and could stand to be removed.

  body: "Joe, I think you're the one deliberately avoiding the glaringly obvious problem:
    No matter how correct or authoritative your suggestions, your attitude and manner,
    conveyed in nearly every post, is one of disdain, condescension, disrespect and
    hostility. Go back and look at what you write. Witty, yes, but also highly repellent.
    It's more distressing to me that you often have a good point, and yet can't articulate
    it in any positive or civilized way, than it would be if you were just a tiresome
    and ignorant complainer. \r\n\r\nMany have pointed this out: you have valuable
    input, and it's always coated in bile. You insult and belittle others on this
    board relentlessly, then cry hurt kitten paws when you perceive a slight or discredit
    (as in the Toronto subway font thread, among others). If you are unaware of this
    hypocrisy, please make yourself cognizant. Meanwhile you have no business lecturing
    us that we're ignoring the plentiful flaws in Typophile. Those problems are acknowledged.
    \r\n\r\nYou push others away with your negative and hostile approach. This is
    not irrelevant to your argument; it colors and impedes it. This is the sticking
    point, not a mass denial about mechanical problems with Typophile. This is not
    an evasion of the more pressing problem of non-compliant code. Your sour attitude
    is an unnecessary and unwelcome ingredient in every discussion you join. Stop
    pretending to be so offended and stop being so offensive. Stop sidestepping what
    must by now be a leitmotif of your correspondence. Nobody else brings as much
    judgement or bitterness to discussions here.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that some
    of your suggested changes would deaden or scramble discussions here. Since discussions
    are the lifeblood of Typophile, and you clearly have only web standards compliance
    on your mind, who has the conflict of interest?"
