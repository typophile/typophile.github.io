body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/proud_6710.png]\r\nI am trying to identify
  the attached image.  I have searched all the font sites as well as using the identifying
  type utilities and nothing has come up.  I don't know if this is a custom font or
  not.  This is actually from a flyer for a family reunion. I have actually identified
  every font on the flyer except this one.  There are some really close fonts, but
  nothing exact.  Thanks for your help on this."
