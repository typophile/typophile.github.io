  body: "What\u2019s your budget? \r\nWho\u2019s your audience?\r\nWhat is the newspaper
    writing about?\r\n\r\nFor basic text work you\u2019ll need a family with minimum
    regular, italic, bold. I recommend a typeface with small caps and both old style
    figures and lining figures. I\u2019d consider adding a medium and and a demi bold
    (slightly darker than the bold weight) as well, for setting white text on coloured
    background, and smaller text like footnotes, sidenotes captions and such. Another
    option is a text family with optical sizes. \r\nTransitional typefaces are quite
    common in news design. They are less quiet than old style serifs (mainly used
    for books). Newsprint is rather dodgy, so you\u2019ll need something that can
    handle ink spread and poor paper. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a few contemporary suggestions:\r\n\r\n\u2022

    need something that can offer more punch. Perhaps a sans serif design \u2014 minimum
    light/regular/black(or bold) \u2014 or a serif design with a lot of contrast between
    horisontals and verticals. Depending on the content/format you might need narrow
    versions of the headline fonts. The display fonts will be your main tool for setting
    the tone of your newspaper. It can be whimsical, serious, trendy +++, depending
    on your audience. \r\nI\u2019d consider pairing a sans and a serif with similar
    skeleton to allow for variations.\r\n\r\n"

    questions:\r\n<cite>What\u2019s your budget?\r\nWho\u2019s your audience?\r\nWhat
    is the newspaper writing about?</cite>\r\n\r\nIMHO these make a real difference.
    Is that paper for kids or parents of that primary school? \r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "budget is really low. newsprint, 2 colors. I think i will go with black and
    orange (autumn here).\r\n\r\nTone of voice \u2013 make these 4 pages interesting
    to audience (girls and boys, 12-17 years old.)\r\n\r\nso \u2013 less corporate,
    more friendly and youthful.\r\n\r\nFF Tisa way if speaking in fonts, i think.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    anyone had real deal with something simiral?\r\n\r\nThanks, Z."

  body: So if budget is really low, have you had a look at the new Vista fonts, namely
    Calibri, Constantia, Candara and Cambria? You have fonts with a fairly modern
    look, the charset you need, and the price is unbeatable.

    Have a look at Hoefler Text! And perhaps something really playful for the headlines,

    I''ve not read the thread) is if the students and staff are going to take the
