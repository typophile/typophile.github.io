  using a nice big square-slab serif for a project and obviously went straight to
  Lubalin graph.As I looked around though I noticed a few other alternatives (all
  below). Any opinions on what I should go with, which aren't worth bothering with,
  favourites, etc?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-lubalin-graph/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=memphis\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=caecilia\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=rockwell"

  body: "Hi Jim,\r\nall of them are quite classic. One could add <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stymie\">Stymie</a>
    and, of course, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Clarendon\">Clarendon</a>
    to this list.\r\n\r\nLubalin Graph is Avant Garde\u2019s slab soul brother, therefore
    <em>very</em> geometric. Nice for headlines, not easy \u2013 to unusable \u2013
    in text.\r\nCaecilia is at the other end of the gamut, having humanistic proportions:
    not so bold-faced, but more versatile.\r\n\r\nNot-so-often seen (can\u2019t call
    them \u2018hidden\u2019) gems: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/city-bq/familytree.html\">City</a>
    by Georg Trump, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/boton-bq/familytree.html\">Boton</a>.\r\n\r\nSimilar
    but fresher faces would be <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/slab/Giza\">Giza</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/slab/Dispatch\">Dispatch</a>. Or <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/silica/\">Silica</a>, if you like to
    follow the Caecilia line.\r\n\r\nCheck out this thread <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/31962\">on
    Serifa, Glypha, Egyptienne F and other slabs</a>, too.\r\nF"

  body: "Thanks Florian - Giza is a beauty, I shall be picking that bad-boy up.\r\n\r\nThe
    face will be used for titling only, so Lubalin Graph was my first choice. I'd
    rejected Clarendon because of the bevelling on the slabs, and its current ubiquitous-ness.\r\n\r\nFor
    my money Memphis and Rockwell are just too similar to Lubalin Graph to merit use
    on their own terms (certainly on my budgets) -- do you feel there's an argument
    in having all three in your arsenal, or just picking a favourite and aligning
    yourself to it. After all, even if I had the cash, I don't want to end up with
    800 typefaces, when many of them are very similar..."

  body: I am partial to Stymie because I like the double-storey a and the low x-height.
    It's very similar to Rockwell but slightly more elegant (to me).

    their own on that I guess :-)

    All slabs of a sort, but less monoline. Amasis and Chaparral have surprisingly
    warm Italics as well. '

  body: "Pick the heaviest weight of Serifa or Glypha, tighten up the tracking a bit
    (1 point range tracking at 24 pt text, 2 pt tracking at 48) and voila--superb
    titling slab at zero cost (I assume you already have Serifa or Glypha if you have
    the Adobe or Bitstream catalogs handy). Rockwell will work too, I'm just not a
    huge Rockwell lover.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to buy new stuff, then yes, FB Giza
    is the slab titling bomb.\r\n"
