  the moment I am using two masters - a light weight and a bold weight.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the process I use to create the MM with FL.\r\n\r\nTools > Mask > Assign Font
  Mask - Select the Bold weight\r\nTools > Multiple Master > Define New Axis - Select
  Weight\r\nSelect all glyphs then, Tools > Multiple Master > Mask to Master - select
  Wt1.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add another medium master to this process - if so
  how would I do that?\r\n"

  body: "It\u2019s not possible in FontLab to have intermediate masters.\r\n\r\nYou
    can cheat though if you \u2018abuse\u2019 an additional width axis and reconfigure
    the masters: Use the Weight axis for Light (wt0, wd0) to Medium (wt1, wd0), put
    the Bold on the Width axis (wt1, wd1). Then you can use the Weight axis for interpolation
    between Light and Medium (with Width set to 0), and the Width axis for interpolation
    between Medium and Bold (with Weight set to 1000).\r\n\r\nYou have to add a dummy
    master to (wt0, wd1) that is never used, because MM always needs two masters on
    one axis. It\u2019s a bit fiddly but should work."

  body: "One interesting application of this \"cheat\" would be to treat the intermediate
    as the cut-off between text and display weights of a typeface, applying a different
    spacing (and maybe even a different vertical proportions) strategy based on the
    MM axis. Using the third axis would even allow two cut-offs (treating the middle
    area as for text and the two outsides as for display).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is normal under the theory that designing type spaces from the \"corners in\"
    is a programmer's solution not fit for all types.\r\n\r\nHP \"...even allow two
    cut-offs (treating the middle area as for text and the two outsides as for display).\"\r\n\r\nSo
    in the middle, medium text, to one outside medium display, then to the other outside...
    what are you trying to say?"

  body: "The middle: weights that are good for running text, hence spaced accordingly.
    To the sides: weights that are too light (\"left\" side) or too dark (\"right\"
    side) for running text, which means they can only be used large, so are spaced
    tightly. All in one MM space with 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 axes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: More generally (light and dark being only one set of variables), I understood
    Hrant's comment to imply two different display styles each interpolable with a
    single text style but not designed to be interpolable with each other. Of course,
    there's no reason why the display styles should be limited to two.

    about this technology. You need to round 1/2 to 1, and 1 to 2, and then 4 will
    be the number of masters, not 1 or 2 or 3... \r\n\r\n\"I understood Hrant's comment

  body: Yes, that is what I understood Hrant to imply, if I am in turn understanding
    you correctly. So, for example, there would be an axis between Text and Display
    1, and another axis between Text and Display 2. Note, that I used the phrase 'designed
    to be interpolable', which is different from interpolable per se. Since outline
    compatibility of Text to Display 1 and Text to Display 2 implies outline compatibility
    between Display 1 and Display 2, technically the two display masters are also
    interpolable, but in the design scheme they are not interpolated because their
    axis relationship is each to Text, not to each other.

  body: "Yes. Basically it's a one-step extension to what Jens described (so a \"half\",
    meaning fake, axis on each side of the main/text weight axis) with the twist the
    half axes on the sides would have display (tight) spacing, since they would be
    respectively too light or dark for text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I think your notion of 'half axes' is confusing, Hrant. Any  axis between
    two masters is a complete axis. It makes more sense to think of an interpolation
    matrix of axes. What Jen's 'cheat' involves is individual axes pointing off a
    central structure of interlocking axes. If you're using FontLab, this needs to
    be handled using separate sources for different parts of the matrix.

  body: "Yes, I understood, but I think it is not a helpful terminology. The scheme
    needs to be describable in all the ways in which it can occur, one of which is
    that there are simply two axes -- as in the example I gave of Text, Display 1
    and Display 2 -- and in which it makes no sense to try to talk of 'full' and 'half'
    axes. If you want to be able to distinguish terminologically, I suggest something
    like 'knitted axes' and 'independent axes'. So, for example, four masters that
    enable interpolation between any of the four constitute a matrix of six knitted
    axes, to which might be added, using Jen's approach, any number of independent
    axes involving additional masters that are not interpolated to other masters in
    the matrix.\r\n\r\nNow, from this it follows that if one can bold independent
    axes onto a knitted matrix, one can also bolt knitted matrices onto each other,
    and that these might even attach to each other at more than one master. That's
    the point at which you really need to draw diagrams to keep it straight in your
    head. I recall David Lemon telling me once that Adobe made a 3D model of the interpolation
    matrix for Kepler."
