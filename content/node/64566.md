  body: "Mark's example is a perfectly usable grid, but that article poses some issues
    for the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is no indication of how EXACTLY the ratios/dimensions
    were calculated (see comments for others who encountered the same problem).\r\n\r\nSecond,
    the article doesn't indicate WHY that particular grid was picked (i.e., the intended
    use of the grid). A useful grid should have a purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen I start working
    on a grid -- especially web grids -- I often use the following \"Grid Calculator\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.29digital.net/grid/\r\n\r\nWhile
    I do think that it is good to be cognizant of the mathematical aspects of a grid,
    a grid can be unique and flexible, and ultimately it is your personal, eyeballing
    judgement that will be most helpful.\r\n\r\nWhen I am arhitecting a grid, I use
    the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. How wide will columns of body text be? Maximum?
    Minimum? Exceptions?\r\n\r\n2. How many columns per page? Again, max, minimum,
    exceptions.\r\n\r\n3. On a page with 1 pic, 1 header, and max columns of text,
    what dimensions do I want.\r\n\r\nI typically start with what I feel will be the
    most common layout and work backward from there. The problem with a math-based
    grid is that sometimes it isn't mindful of all the different layout combinations.\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    you would sketch out a number of different wireframes and THEN figure out exactly
    what grid you want to use. Remember, the main purpose of a grid is consistency.
    Good ratios are simply the gravy.\r\n\r\nSeveral magazines have very consistent
    modular grid usage. Check out GOOD magazine, they have a nice grid that was created
    by Area17. Most magazines have a formula, from which you can infer the grid they
    are using."
