body: I got this image from the printer of a page using my typeface SeriuosSans. At
  the press some characters magically disappeared, while they were correctly displayed
  in the pdf and in the proofing print. I suppose it has to do with my font, but does
  anyone have any idea what could have caused this?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1778_4273.JPG]

  body: "Ouch!\r\n\r\nWhat software did you create the font with? Check winding order
    and -- I think I've read this as well -- if there are two exactly overlapping
    copies of the glyphs."

  body: What Theunis said about the exactly overlaid duplicate path is the most likely
    culprit. I have seen this happen before with Adobe's Times Ten font back in the
    nineties.

  body: "I made this in Glyphs and Fontlab. No overlapping shapes. In the revision
    I checked all directions of the outlines; there were some irregularities but not
    exclusively to the charaters affected in the image\u2026 Right now I am testing:
    I hope the corrected outlines will do the trick. Never seen this happen before."

  body: "What type of font is it: TrueType or Postscript (CFF)? \r\n\r\nI assume the
    printing press is full digital. Was the proofing print done on a device different
    from the actual press? If so, is the proofing device controlled by a software
    or print server different from the press?"

  body: "The font is OTF (postscript flavoured), the printing press is offset, the
    proofs were made digital. This is an insert I made in a magazine production of
    someone else; I do not know the printer's specifics, but proof and execution were
    seperate. My big question remains: if it is in the font, what did I do differently/
    wrong from the fonts I produced earlier which never gave any trouble of this kind?
    Riddle me that\u2026"

  body: "I kind of doubt that there is anything wrong with your font. \r\n\r\nYou
    say they are printing offset, so:\r\n1. They are using film to make the plates,
    or\r\n2. They are going direct-to-plate.\r\n\r\nSo I believe the problem might
    lie in the imagesetter or printer software since your proofing process came out
    correct. It may be that they are using a Postscript emulator rather than true
    Postscript, which can certainly cause problems."

    that can easily spot if there are overlapping contours. "
