    but it&#39;s one of my distressed typewriter faces of choice.

  body: Though I concur Cheshiredave&#39;s opinion, I must say I&#39;ve always had
    a soft spot for Cornel Windlin&#39;s delightfully square <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_packages_main.ep?id=96">
    FF Magda</A>, <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_packages_main.ep?id=13">
    FF Trixie</A>&#39;s sister face, with its many variations, multiple possiblities

  body: BTW The characters in the different weights of FF Magda are positioned in
    such a way in relation to the baseline, that you can overlay different weights
    in different colours for even more striking &#40;pardon the pun&#41; effect. And
    Cornel also designed a <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/servlets/fontshop.display?f=m&amp;xp=509#509">
    clean</A> version.
