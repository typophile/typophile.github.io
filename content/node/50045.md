  looks like it has been printed, scanned, and re-vectorized a dozen times in a row,
  because the lines and nodes just make no sense, even going so far as to loop over
  one another on the m.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what this is supposed to be or what
  it started its life as?"

  body: That's what it reminded me of, but I don't think that's it.  It's possible
    that it's just an atrociously drawn freehand logo.
