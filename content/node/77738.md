  body: I don't recognize it, but keep in mind the "distinctive upper case P" may
    just be a lowercase p raised to the baseline.

  body: "Judging by the perfect alignment of the slopes between i and P/p, I would
    say it\u2019s a custom job. (Using, as Craig points out, a raised p as P).\r\nIt
    reminds me somewhat of Caslon Graphique and the likes."

    Hawthorn]] matches almost perfectly (just need to customize the /p).
