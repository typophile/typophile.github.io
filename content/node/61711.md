  body: "Hi Florian\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your reply. You're suggestions were
    great, but they're missing one thing in particular that I'm looking for. I'm ideally
    looking for something with the elaborate tails. And the capitals (like the \"S\")
    in particular, the way the top part crosses over the rest of the letters... any
    ideas? I appreciate any suggestions! "

    are too narrow".
