body: "Stockholm city council has launched a new identity system, replacing the current
  one which includes Karl-Erik Forsberg's 1961 seal and a rather 90s-ey (but good)
  visual look with a lot of airy Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nThe new identity includes a new
  logotype and a custom typeface, Stockholm Type, based on Swiss Typefaces' Euclid
  (which is one of those trendy \"new clumsy\" experimental geometric sans types),
  but significantly neutered here into something rather Museo Sans-esque. Not sure
  what it's supposed to say about Stockholm. There's little info on [[http://www.stockholm.se/|the
  new website]] (which has the new typeface as a web font, look a those numerals!)
  but it's apparently by Swiss Typefaces' [[http://www.emmanuelrey.ch/|Emmanuel Rey]],
  with the identity by [[http://esseninternational.com/one-city-one-vision-one-statement/|Essen]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stockholm_nygrafiskprofil3_4561.jpg]"

  body: (Suffice to say I don't like it much. Wrong weight killing the impact of Forsberg's
    St. Erik in the logo. The typeface I'd like to see more of, especially in print,
    but it seems rather painfully on-trend without using the other things that make
    that trend sucessful.)

    the old seal, now graceful geometry is teetering over into cartoonish geometry. '

    to like it.

  body: "But all of that has some sort of purpose, if only iconoclasm, purification
    and interesting visual rhythm. Here, though, they've taken the least interesting
    part of the design \u2013 the style of typeface, which isn't [[http://sthlmmayday.se/?attachment_id=103|even]]*
    [[http://imgur.com/PZdhc77|essential]] anyway \u2013 neutered it still futher
    by dropping the ubiquitous always-on medium weight, and placed it in the middle
    of a standard formula A1 brand identity. All of the other elements of anti-design
    are gone, rendering the type choice just awkward.\r\n\r\n* Nice rotalics in this
    one. Anyone know what they are?"
