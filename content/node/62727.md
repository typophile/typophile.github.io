body: Somebody just brought this up at work. A job they had set in Stempel Schneidler
  was sent back for fixing because of the question mark. I had a look and was a bit
  surprised to see this. At first I thought maybe they had accidentally typed a Spanish
  one, but the dot is on the bottom. I find the design of it kind of extreme for an
  otherwise very legible face.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stempel_3958.png]

  body: "Oh, well, for my eyes it is quite okay. I learned in school in Austria to
    write the question mark as a reversed S with a dot at the bottom \u2026\r\n\r\nCompare
    it to the <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?L1\">Schulschrift</a>. So it
    makes sense to me (although it still looks quirky in Stempel Schneidler)."

  body: "If I saw that on a page I would probably wonder how a designer managed to
    get an odd Arabic character in the middle of a text block. I can see there being
    situations where one could get away with using this question mark, but if it\u2019s
    in running text it needs to be changed."

    after it fell off.

  body: So, if you are proposing this was designed for odd questions, and that normal
    questions would use a normal question mark of some kind, I think that's brilliant!

  body: Having a different question mark as an alternate, so the typeface can serve
    users in other countries, would not be a bad thing, but, yes, a German typeface
    designed for a German market is allowed to have a question mark that is accepted
    there if not elsewhere.

  body: "See Rainer\u2019s answer (first comment). To my eyes, it sure is a non-standard
    design, but definitely acceptable. Having said that, I haven\u2019t seen a lot
    of Schneidler recently. The typeface also is not mentioned as one of the commonly
    used ones for book design, in the 2005 sample compiled by the Museum der Arbeit.
    This analysis looked at 1207 books printed by Clausen & Bosse, for various publishers.
    Assuming it is somewhat representative, even Trump, Goudy and Berling are more
    \u2018accepted\u2019 than Schneidler."
