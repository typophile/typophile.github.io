body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have designed this logotype (comments welcome) for college
  who works within the Health & Safety industry. I am happy with the structure and
  colours as I think its quite self explanatory but I wanted your feedback on how
  to best fine tune the space between the letters. I have wanted to keep the kerning
  quite tight as the structure of the symbol is already quite long and I believe this
  face works better that way. What do you guys think? It it ok to have the 'ty' touch
  as they do in 'Safety'? Is the distance between the 'He' ok? \r\n\r\nIt looks a
  bit clumsy at the mo.\r\n\r\nI'm interested to know from those that know more than
  me on these matters.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\njavier[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HS_5075.gif]"

  body: "Hi there Javier, \r\n\r\nMust say that I like the idea of the logo. Its always
    refreshing to see another use of the health and safety cross. \r\n\r\nBut there
    are a few things that I find a little uncomfortable. At first glance the logo
    reminds me of the standard design for signage for hospitals,exit signs etc, maybe
    this is the idea, in which case you have succeeded. \r\n\r\nSomething else that
    worries me is that due to it looking like these signs it almost lacks a 'logo'
    feel to it. I am not sure if this has someting to do with the resemblance to these
    signs. Maybe it would help to change the typeface to something similar that does
    teh same job. Something that, when you look at it, you can tell it is meant to
    look like a sign but at closer inspection stads as an individual logo because
    of the slight differences. \r\n\r\nAlso, look at the horizontal bar of the cross,
    optically it looks thick than the vertical cross. I am not sure if this is due
    to my screen though. \r\n\r\nBut overall I think yu have something that is starting
    to work. Remember that a logo needs to reflect the nature of the client, this
    is a logo that represents health and safety, you will find that on these signs
    the kerning is set a little looser than normal, which enables people to read the
    signs from a long distance. You may want to consider that in this logo. Tight
    kerning might be going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nMatt"

    balance. And the inner letterforms are having a hard time handling the narrow
    spacing. Have you tried with another weight?\r\n\r\nKTKM"

  body: "Hi guys, thanks for your comments.\r\nIndeed I was trying to resemble the
    signage on hospitals, etc. I wanted to make it ultra-functional. I guess though
    this 'angle' makes the logo suffer from a lack of charisma/personality in some
    way. I think I will lokk at other typefaces that still maintain the concept but
    with a slight twist.\r\n\r\nI will heed both your points on kerning and face weight
    I'll post other options.\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\njavier"
