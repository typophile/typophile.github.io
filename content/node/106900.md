  It\u2019s probably custom but does anyone know what it is or originates from.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nKarl"

  body: You posted a request for an ID of this same font on the 15th but got no identification.
    It isn't likely a font that is publicly available considering it is a liquor company.
    Many of them have proprietary fonts and sometimes their main logos are just one-off
    art.

    but I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/yana|Yana]] by Laura
    Worthington.
