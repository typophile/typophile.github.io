  both pretty common, but not typefaces that I use and I can't remember what the names
  are. Plus I'm on a tight deadline... Help!\r\n"

  body: "The sans is very close to Helvetica Compressed but different in some details,
    it might be close enough for you though. I\u2019ve seen it before here on the
    ID Board but don\u2019t think it was identified then!\r\n\r\nThe semi-serif is
    indeed Serpentine Bold."

    might do the trick, but it also annoyed me that I'd seen that font before but
    couldn't think of its name.\r\n\r\nAnyways, think I'll stick to Helvetica. Thanks
    for the ID of the Serpentine."

    you\u2019re right, it does appear to be! The versions of Impact shown online are
    different in certain key features to the Windows version, enough that it throws
    off the identification."
