  on Typography & Visual Communication</a> in Thessaloniki today, Dr Peter Karow -
  <em>wunderkind</em> founder of URW, father of IKARUS and behind much seminal digital
  type R&D - asserted that InDesign incorporated the \"<em>hz</em>-Program\" which
  is familiar to typophiles as his collaboration with Hermann Zapf to add \"artificial
  intelligence\" to H&J.\r\n\r\nAs a TeX user and porter since the 1980s, and someone
  who always lamented the relative braindeadness of all Mac WYSIWYG engines until
  this innovation finally appeared in InDesign, I particularly noted Adobe's bragging
  in sales literature that they had finally noticed and incorporated TeX's engine
  - the source code of which has been freely available since around 1983. (It's understood
  that Adobe's formatter goes a little beyond TeX's, at least in convenience.)\r\n\r\nThe
  <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/whatis.html\">TeX history page</a> says that TeX's
  method is \"the basis\" of the <em>hz</em>-Program, but this is the first mention
  I've seen that the two pieces of software are connected in any way. Dr Karow did
  not mention TeX in his talk [Professor Knuth copped one mention re: METAFONT, but
  oddly, Dr Karow mentioned that weight interpolation from a single master remains
  unsolved, although MF surely is one solution]. I felt too awestruck by the great
  man - and confused by not being able to relate his assertion to Adobe's literature
  - to ask him myself; but can any typophile confirm what the connection actually
  is? Is Adobe too coy *cough*NIH*cough* to admit that their fancy new algorithm is
  actually Made In Germany?\r\n\r\nBtw, Hrant: You are sorely missed in Thessaloniki.
  They tell me you haven't registered (yet?) I hope no misfortune is keeping you from
  our company."

    InDesign 1.0's multi-line composer. Bringhurst talks about the HZ Program in 9.3.
    (Scribal Justification; page 189..191). I immediately connected the two together.
    Because URW developed the algorithm in 1993 with Zapf. The reference was Gutenberg's
    42-line bible.\r\n\r\nThe method is also called (as Bringhurst says) <cite>Semitic

    to anything else even though it lacked many features others had for years. And
    got them with newer versions. And more.\r\n\r\nTo call it like that: I LOVE InDesign
    mainly because of HZ (or its derivative) implementation.\r\n"

    more sorely than anybody there could possibly be missing me. It has become my
    favorite type conference ever. There are a few reasons I couldn't make it, some
    of them unfortunate (but not tragic or anything) but one of them is actually a
    good reason: we're taking a family vacation to Crete in July, and going to Greece
    twice in a month would be too much of a good thing! Anyway, I recently wrote to
    Klimis expressing my regrets, and promising to make a better effort to show up
    next time.\r\n\r\nConcerning the HZ/TeX connection, all I can tell you myself
    is that there does seem to be <em>some</em> connection: during a TeX-centric project
    I worked on with a university in Britain, I was told that they had acquired development
    rights to the HZ algorithm as a result... This is pretty tenuous, I know - sorry.\r\n\r\n>

    They also had Dr K work with them for a year in 1994. So what they have in Indy
    is HZ. The sales blurb would have talked about TeX because potential customers
    (such as TeX users) would not know what HZ was. \r\n\r\nAs to the TeX and HZ connection,
    a lot of ideas flowing between Peter and Donald so maybe there's an element of

  body: "Sii, Nice to meet you at the conference. You and I caught David Lemon's extempore
    answer; thankyou for summarising.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific on the TeX question,
    I think we can regard seriously the implication on the TUG \"What is TeX\" page
    that TeX's method (essentially complete and public by 1983, distributed on tape,
    in papers, and in book form as a literate program) is the basis for <em>hz</em>'s
    \"optimal\" paragraph composer, so Adobe's marketing literature crediting TeX
    isn't exactly wrong. Knuth's flawless implementation would have made an ideal
    (and legally possible, being early \"open source\") foundation. (The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hz-program\">hz-Program</a>
    page on Wikipedia hints at a connection but does not claim direct descent from
    TeX.)\r\n\r\nThe missing concept from TeX's implementation is the continuous modification
    of typeface parameters to optimise setting (whether geometrically - horizontal
    scaling, tracking) or through parametric fonts (Multiple Master, etc). I am not
    sure how much of this InDesign actually does today, though it seems that it was
    part of the <em>hz</em>-Program concept.\r\n\r\nAs David reminds us, the association
    of Dr Karow, Professor Knuth, and Hermann Zapf is so close that it's rather difficult
    to say exactly who conceived what; we can assume that much wine and beer was consumed
    in smoke filled rooms while the concept evolved. :-)\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was piqued
    because I'd never seen the programs publicly associated before. I do see that
    there is a sentence about the Adobe/<em>hz</em> link on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Zapf\">Zapf's
    Wikipedia page.</a>\r\n\r\nHrant: All I can do is hope that we can both be at
    the next one. Also, will you help me persuade Grant H. to sample the pleasures
    of Thessaloniki with us. My efforts this year were in vain, but perhaps he knew
    you weren't coming. :-)"

    feature for our implementation of TeX. Worked fine. But in general, to each their
    own. I'd say that the Adobe paragraph composer lacks the refinement of TeX, where
    you could program penalties and/or demerits for a large number of things. As far
    as <cite>setting text</cite> goes, and based on limited exposure, InDesign doesn't
    approach TeX. As far as a \"layout engine\" for modern graphic design goes --
    where with each passing day 'text' seems to move farther down on the list of importance
    -- InDesign seems far better.\r\n\r\nI wonder if Adobe's not mentioning TeX isn't
    a corporate thing. These days corporate attorneys seem at the center of everything,
    and patent law makes sense to us laymen only when you consider how lawyers make
    money."

  body: "Charles, yes, there are certainly ways to get tracking in TeX using macros,
    and this can work together with the smart composer, but with limitations. Firstly,
    pairwise kerning is defeated if you add explicit space (\"glue\") between characters,
    either manually or with a macro; horizontal scaling is not possible in standard
    TeX; and the traditional TeX paragraph composer can't access these features (or
    the more advanced idea of altering a parametric font) for its own purposes, e.g.
    line by line.\r\n\r\n[In other words, if you wanted to allow, for example, a small
    amount of negative tracking to assist in H&J - as an XPress paragraph style can
    do - then you would need to give up pairwise kerning, and you'd have to ensure
    that entire paragraphs received the glue consistently throughout - unless you
    are doing manual line by line tweaking. The algorithm can make counter-intuitive
    changes to breaks in order to improve global optimality, so such fine tuning is
    neither as necessary nor as simple as it is with a dumb algorithm. As we know,
    XPress needs a lot of manual help to get anywhere close to ID's composer.]\r\n\r\nBut
    these are minor details in a 25 year old program, which, as you say, remains essentially
    unparalleled in terms of setting quality. (Users of Berthold digital systems may
    have grounds to quibble.)\r\n\r\nRe: mentioning TeX - you must have misread what
    I wrote: Early Adobe literature credited TeX directly for its advanced composer,
    but did not mention <em>hz,</em> and it is now clear that mentioning <em>both</em>
    would set up a contradiction which remains unresolved. \r\n\r\nMy initial question
    is, however, answered: URW's IP, and the personal attention of Dr Karow, were
    direct inputs to Adobe InDesign."

    \\kern (in the text stream) within this command, you'd better take a look, because
    it might not measure what you thought it would. This letterspace command could
    be either positive or negative. It worked fine for, say, small caps, or for tightening
    up words on the title page, but we didn't use it for general text setting; you
    would have had to put it in each paragraph explicitly.\r\n\r\nDays gone by, when

  body: Hrant, I don't think 'semitic justification' is a strange term, but note that
    it applies specifically to one aspect of the hz algorithm, i.e. the intelligent
    stretching or condensing of letter widths. This aspect of the algorithm is not
    implemented in InDesign. Since this method of justification is precisely that
    used in the Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac and quite probably other semitic scripts, the
    name makes a lot of sense.

  body: "OK, I get it now, but I still think there's a difference: the letters are
    not really \"stretched\" the way we think of the term, and the way the HZ algorithm
    does it; it's more that the horizontal joins are stretched (closer to Arabic)
    or that the horizontal parts of letters are stretched (closer to Hebrew). This
    might seem like nitpicking, except when you look at the large quality difference
    in the actual results between Semitic scripts using the feature versus Latin,
    which doesn't really \"stretch\" at all well. Furthermore, the large structural
    difference between Arabic and Hebrew (in terms of joining or not) makes the label
    wobbly. I suspect he was just itching to call something \"Semitic\".  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW,

  body: "Charles, I believe that to say, \"<em>automatic</em> pairwise kerning is
    defeated,\" is fully correct. In this circumstance it is very difficult for a
    macro to restore pairwise kerns, but theoretically possible, I suppose. Of course,
    I'm talking about standard TeX - perhaps Larry made a supporting source code mod?\r\n\r\nI
    had a chance to talk over some of the differences between TeX and <em>hz</em>
    with Dr Karow this evening, but I am still unsure of many facts. I hope he won't
    mind if I pass on some fruits of that talk here, as I recall it.\r\n\r\nIt seems
    that Adobe's implementation has diverged (less and/or more) from the original
    <em>hz</em> concept, but reasonably enough, he is not able to shed light on details.
    He did confirm that Professor Knuth's original code (\"that he could write over
    a weekend\") was the starting point, but was further \"polished over months\"
    by [URW's] software engineers.\r\n\r\nDr Karow reminded me that URW had a firm
    grip on any relevant technology for interpolation (e.g. condensed/expanded), decades
    before Adobe's Multiple Master, and I suspect <em>hz</em> would have leveraged
    this.\r\n\r\nWe might glean some of the original concept from what was written
    about <em>hz</em> before the IP passed to Adobe. As I speculate, it may have worked
    on two levels, firstly the parameters we are familiar with (condense/expand within
    about 2%, to be unnoticed) and secondly the stretch/join mechanism - for which
    opportunities seem rather sparse in Roman text (Hrant, any references for that
    capability in <em>hz</em>? For that matter, any references in the 42-line bible?)
    Dr Karow mentioned that more extensive use of ligatures (\xE0 la Gutenberg) was
    tested but was not received well by his typographic judges. I got the impression
    that simple tracking or scaling was considered too unsophisticated."

    and I still don't know why. The book was set in the first version of InDesign,
    and some stretch got applied to random passages. Obviously I didn't do it manually,
    and I can't imagine what sequence of accidental keystrokes or cursor clicks might
    have produced similar errors in different parts of the book.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    'semitic justification': the idea of the <em>hz</em> smart stretching (the <em>Ek</em>-program)
    is that it would not increase the weight of vertical stems, but would only increase
    the distance between them, stretching the horizontal strokes. This is explained
    and demonstrated in the original URW brochure: 'Only the white counters are actually
    expanded or condesnsed, not affecting stroke widths at all...'. The results in
    the brochure are impressive (as are the results of the <em>Kq</em>-program for
    optical scaling from a single master), and the amount of expansion or contraction
    required for justification would be very small. Obviously some type designs might
    be expected to fare better than others (the fact that examples of different <em>hz</em>
    programs are illustrated in the brochure with different typefaces makes me wonder
    to what degree types were selected for showing the software to advantage).\r\n\r\nThe
    main difference between the <em>hz</em> approach and that used in justification
    of semitic scripts is that the latter are rule-based on the level of the word
    or the line, while the <em>hz</em> scaling is rule-based at the level of the individual
    letters.\r\n"
