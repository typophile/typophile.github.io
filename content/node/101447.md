  body: "Maybe because it's a technical character that's only really used in computer
    programming? So it doesn't need to fit in with running text as much? There are
    different versions of the forward slash, as well \u2014 the virgule is probably
    what you mean by a \"regular\" slash; there's also the solidus, which is used
    as a fraction bar."

    forward slash, because of the \"f\" and \"j\".\r\n\r\nIn any case, it seems to

  body: "<em>In any case, it seems to me there's little reason to make the slants
    symmetrical.</em>\r\n\r\nSomewhat to my surprise, the slash and backslash are
    not treated by Unicode as mirroring characters for bidirectional layout purposes.
    If they were, then that would be a strongish reason to make them symmetrical.
    But even though they're not, my inclination would be to make them symmetrical
    because in my experience any character with a flipped version is likely to be
    used as /mirrored punctuation\\ by someone out there."
