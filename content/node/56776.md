  paragraphs with space? using the same amount of space as the line-height is too
  much, but less space makes the text leave the baseline grid.\r\n\r\nTo quote [[http://www.the-monks.com/|the

  body: "Newspapers actually don't really align to baseline. They adjust leading to
    visually same height that lines up first and last line in columns. It does need
    a very good typographer to set text this way but it can be done transparently
    for the reader without distracting his reading.\r\n\r\nI suspect you'll need some
    more inter-column space when doing this kind of thing, so lines between columns
    won't interfere with each other when passing from right to left to read next line
    of text.\r\n\r\nAnyway. Check great designed newspapers (with spaced paragraphs)
    yourself and count lines...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
