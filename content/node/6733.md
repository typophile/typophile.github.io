    It was originally a metal face, but I always remember seeing Orplid in rubdown/cutout
    lettering catalogs in the seventies. It was also available in phototype for headlines.
    It was pretty common in type catalogs so I gotta think somebody&#39;s digitized
    it by now but possibly given it a different name.
