body: "I'm looking for a typeface that comes in heavy weights, and has echoes of Gotham
  black (strong, authoritative but unpretentious), but isn't Gotham. A bit warmer,
  perhaps with subtly rounded corners, or perhaps a bit more condensed. Still basically
  geometrical though.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly for a logo, probably all-caps. \r\n\r\nNeutra
  would be a possibility, except there are two Ns in the logo and the sharp-angled
  Neutra N isn't the feel I'm going for here.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"
