body: "How I do it? And What is its message?\r\nThis is my Icon, it says QASSIM HAIDER
  in Arabic language. However, it is based on an old arabic calligraphy, which is
  (Koffi Morabbat). It is really very old, but the appearance of it looks like the
  modern arts. Overall, I love this style of typefaces, and I beleive it is so close
  to my personality.\r\n\r\nhttp://qalligraphy.net/imgs/qassim_haider_art.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://qalligraphy.net/blog/qassim_haider_icon_built.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://qalligraphy.net/?page=blog&id=1"
