  happy new year, would anybody be able to identify this for me? I have searched in
  a lot of places but unfortunately can't come up with the exact match. It is possible
  that they aren't in digital format as they are taken from dials and gauges manufactured
  in the UK in the 50's and 60's.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help."

  body: "Thank you oldnick for replying. You are right although I couldn't find a
    British equivalent to the Leroy lettering device. From your help and after more
    researching I have found that there is a font called sublime that perfectly mimics
    the style of the characters but is deliberately made to look inky and slightly
    imperfect. There are others like Bryant and Din 17 but they aren't exact unfortunately.
    There is an elusive autocad leroy font around but I am unable to find it and anyway
    I don't think I would be able to implement it as I don't use autocad. If you or
    anybody else knows of a digital Leroy font out there other than the sublime one
    I would be very grateful although I suspect that it hasn't been converted into
    a digital format.\r\nThanks. "
