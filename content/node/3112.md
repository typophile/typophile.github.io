body: I want to use a number of TTF Chinses fonts in Photoshop as graphic elements.  Unfortunately,
  Windows can install non-english fonts, but cannot recognize them.  I hear that you
  can go to the &#34;Regions&#34; area in Control Panel, and add Chinese functionality,
  but naturally, I don&#39;t want to set my WHOLE PC to display nothing but Chinese!  Can
  anyone assist me in enabling the Chinese fonts so that Photoshop can use them to
  make vector font shapes in images, while retaining my english core WIndows funcationality???  I
  don&#39;t want to start fiddling with the core display attributes of Windows without
  knowing what I&#39;m doing, of course.  Thanks in advance!!!

    Star</a> works very well with Photoshop and Flash too. And you don&#39;t need
    to do any of that Regions thingy at all. You can email me if you need more help.
    <BR> <BR>Whatever you do, don&#39;t get <a href="http://www.njstar.com/">NJStar</a>.
    It doesn&#39;t work well with Photoshop. <BR> <BR>Alternatively, you could borrow
    someone&#39;s Mac, the Chinese support is pretty good even for OS9. <BR> <BR>

    thing but am having no luck at all...  The Chinese Star app- does it use a standard
    keyboard to input characters?  Sorry for my ignorance, but I know that Chinese
    has MANY more ideograms than English has letters...  I&#39;ll email you if I don&#39;t

    directly? I tried &#62;installing the Regional Support but I still think I&#39;m
    doing something &#62;wrong, because I don&#39;t have access to the Chinese fonts
    I&#39;ve been &#62;downloading- I suspect it&#39;s my misuse of the Regions thing.
    Any help is &#62;GREATLY appreciated- thanks!!'

  body: I don&#39;t know all that much about the nitty gritty behind Windows 2000
    &amp; XP, but it&#39;s been my impression that if you don&#39;t chose foreign
    language support when you <i>first</i> install your OS, it&#39;s virtually impossible
    to enable it later. In a pinch, you could move some of the glyphs in the font
    onto the Windows Latin 1252 codepage/Unicode range... <BR> <BR>Nate

  body: 'You can indeed install Chinese language support on any Windows XP machine:
    all you do is go to &#39;Control Panel / Regional and Language Options&#39; and
    check &#39;Install files for East Asian languages&#39; on the Languages tab and
    then click &#39;Details&#39; to view and edit language and keyboard support. Note
    that this will not change your operating environment to Chinese: it will just
    add fonts and IME for the language you select. &#40;Note that you will need to
    have your XP install CD handy.&#41; In the &#39;Text Services and Input Languages&#39;
    window that opens when you click &#39;Details&#39;, click &#39;Add...&#39; and
    then select the language and &#39;Keyboard layout/IME&#39; for the language you
    want. Note that you will have several different options for Chinese depending
    on locale &#40;Hong Kong, Macau, PRC, etc.&#41; and then you will have several
    different options for IME. There are lots of different ways to input Chinese text,
    used by different communities across Asia. <BR> <BR>East Asian IME&#39;s work
    from a standard keyboard, but are generally based on a phonetic input method,
    which means you need to be able to speak Chinese in order to be able to use them.
    You start typing, e.g. using Pinyin transliteration, and the IME presents you
    with possible hanza characters that correspond to the sounds that you type. You
    then select the character you want, and then proceed. As I say, you really need
    to know what you are doing, and be proficient in one of the phonetic systems for
    transcribing Chinese. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tested Chinese IMEs in PhotoShop 7 on
    Windows XP, and they work remarkably well. <BR> <BR>If you can&#39;t type Chinese
    in this way, and only need to use a few characters, another solution is to select
    your hanza characters by Unicode value, enter them in Wordpad, and then copy and
    paste into Photoshop. If you know the Unicode value of the characters you want
    to use, you can type the hexadecimal value in Wordpad, e.g. 7C73, and then hit
    alt&#43;x immediately after the code value; this will convert the code value into
    the corresponding Chinese character. You can then select the character and copy
    and paste into Photoshop. <BR> <BR>IMPORTANT NOTE: I believe these suggestions
    may only work in Photoshop 7. Possibly in 6, but definitely not in 5.'

  body: Oy vey...It sounds as if I&#39;ve been led astray. Is it true then, John,
    that I can uninstall the myriad languages that my Windows 2000 is currently supporting,
    and then just reinstall support for them when I need it?

    you should definitely try John&#39;s method first. <BR> <BR>Anyway I have here

    can download a free 30-day trial of NJStar, another chinese software, but it doesn&#39;t
    work 100% with PShop. Havent tried it on XP though, so I&#39;m not sure abt that.
