  amalgamation of several letters/hand-painted. Hoping that someone can point me in
  the right direction to at least getting started to replicating it.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBen"

  body: Maybe for the text (although the apostrophe is different), but the $2 seems
    to be something else entirely.

  body: "The |\u2019| is similar to Franklin Gothic in construction.\r\nThe |$| looks
    self made based on |S| or |s| in a style usually used for narrow and/or extrabold
    faces.*\r\nThe |2| looks pretty helvetic to me (if a bit deformed by hand-painting).\r\n\r\nBut
    maybe there is something more similar out there.\r\n\r\n* See, for example this
    version of Helvetica: \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans/t-bold-extended/glyphs.html#glyphs/469553/5\r\n"
