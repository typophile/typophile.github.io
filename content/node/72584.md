  at... But in Typophile I get nothing but stinkly little Times to read, and crappy
  old Courier to write?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "David,\r\n\r\nthis behaviour seems to be triggered by the erroneous value
    of the language attribute in the HTML element; <code>lang=\"Object id #6\"</code>.
    At least, I was able to see my user-defined fonts after I deleted that bit. There
    is more invalid code in there, but that is the crucial bit, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://validator.w3.org/\">W3C\u2019s Markup Validation Service</a> states
    that the <cite>value of attribute \"lang\"</cite> [and \"xml:lang\"] <cite>must
    be a single token</cite>, i.e. <cite>[t]his attribute can not take a space-separated
    list of words as a value, but only one word (\"token\"). This may also be caused
    by the use of a space for the value of an attribute which does not permit it.</cite>
    Furthermore, the <cite>character \"#\" is not allowed in the value of attribute
    \"lang\"</cite>.\r\n\r\nFlorian"

    but when I wanted to have Firefox ignore the Typophile CSS-defined fonts and display
    everything in my Firefox preference (when I was testing those WhitmanScreen attempts)
    I had to set the Preferences > Content > Fonts& Colors > Advanced ... for \u201COther
    Languages\u201D (instead of Western) in order to have it not display the Times
    and Courier.\r\n\r\nAs Florian point out, there\u2019s something funky about the
    Language designations for this site.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As Florian says, the CSS-defined font that most everyone will see here on
    Typophile is Georgia.\r\n\r\nBut if you try to bypass that CSS with various browser
    preferences \u2014 like telling Firefox not to \u201Callow pages to choose their
    own fonts, instead of my selections\u201D or directing Safari to use your own
    external CSS stylesheets instead \u2014 Typophile doesn\u2019t behave as expected,
    because of the issues discussed above.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Firefox-content_3648.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Safari-advanced_6438.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs
    David complained, instead of seeing your selections, you get a system default.
    Times in most cases, it seems. What I suggested above about Other Languages gets
    Firefox around the glitch. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s code that can be
    written into a CSS to get Safari around it."
