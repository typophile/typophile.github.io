I was assigned to design their new logo. I would appreciate if you could tell me your opinion about this one. What do you think?
Thank you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/caravan_1_4344.jpg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi tilboy,

Font-Choice: I think there are many rounded well executed fonts which are far better than the ancient VAG Rounded used in your draft. I can recommend 
Gotham Rounded 
(http://www.typography.com/catalog/gothamrounded/index.html) or 
Chevin 
(http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000003). 

Logo-Appearance: The first thing that came into my mind, is that the rainbowish forms look like a tunnel/cave or is picturing sending out a signal. Also I think that the square form with rounded corners is more Caravan like. 
If it should be the rainbow form, you can maybe use the C or c to build the caravan rainbow. 

The tracking for the word Caravan is to loose and the tracking for center to tight. Also I would correct the space on the right and left side of the v. Also the space between r and a is to loose.

Are there other ideas/variants/drafts?

Derya

p.s. I like the second draft, but the word center looks bigger than the word caravan.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Very nice. One concern would be the size of "center" in relation to "Caravan." What do you think if you enlarged Caravan the full width of graphic and brought "center" below it centered or right justified?

		<div class="commentbody">that's great. i immediately got "happy trailer!" out of it, which was silly enough to make me smile out loud. it's rally good.

few technical things.

1) your rainbow is egg-shaped. the ellipses are taller than wide. why for?

2) rainbow stripes are different sizes in an odd way. why is the center one thicker..?

3) i could drive a caravan through caravan, specifically between a and v, then v and a.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello everybody. Thank you all for your advices. I really appreciate the fact that you spend time to see my work and advice me. 

Derya: About the font,I was not so sure for my choice. I mean i know i want a rounded font but maybe it won't be this one. Thank you for the links. 
About the logo, you are right about the shape (caravans are squared with rounded corners, only some few very old models are rounded) but it looked better that way in the center of the ''rainbow'' or ''target''.
About the tracking and the spacing u are absolutely right. I will correct it! 
I had few others ideas but i'm not sure if i should show them yet. 
Thank you again, you've been very helpfull!

Hola: Yes, you are right, i need to make smaller the word center. About your idea with the ''center'' below the ''caravan'' I try it and i did'nt like it.But I didn't try the below and right justified idea. I will. 
Thank you so much!   
p.s. I visited you website. Your work is really good.

patricking: I'm glad you liked it, and more glad that you smiled when you saw it!  I wanted a happy logo. 
1) and 2)  i made it that way because i wanted also to be like a half target (except a rainbow) and the caravan to be in the center.  Maybe i should try it again like you said.   
3) hahaha, you are right my friend! I'll fix it! 
Thank you for your comments. 

I' ll make some changes and i'll be back again. 
Thank you all!
