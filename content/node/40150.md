body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vman_5794.jpg]\r\nHello to everybody. \r\nThis
  font looks like a extra light Futura but \"C\", \"G\" and the numbers doesn't match.\r\nDoes
  anybody knows what is this?\r\nThanks in advance. "

  body: This reminds me of one of those awkward Manfred Klein fonts, and it's very
    close to <a href="http://www.dafont.com/geo-sans-light.font">Geo Sans</a>, despite
    the weight difference. Note the 'R'.
