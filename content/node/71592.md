    typefaces aren't commercially available, except for one they released last year.
    \r\n\r\nYou might be hard pressed to find anything similar that is as precisely
    drawn or well balanced, as their work is quite exceptional. Of the abundance of
    similarly styled typefaces out on the market, most are of questionable quality."

  body: "It looks to me like both Jim and Mike are correct--the outlines are definitely
    Frank, and it looks like Non-Format added some lines to suggest 'counters' in
    places.\r\n\r\nEdit: ID complete, as far as I'm concerned. Thanks, folks. \r\n\r\nEdit
    again: meant to say 'Pump', not 'Frank'. The outlines are definitely Pump."

    carefully enough first before posting:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29460\r\n\r\nSorry.
    FWIW, people there came up with the same kinds of suggestions, and the last in
    the thread was Burvo's Pump. And it looks to me like Burvo designers started with
    egyptienne outlines to get their final product."
