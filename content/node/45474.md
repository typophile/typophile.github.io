  evenings. Here's a look at some digitized work from today.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Olives_taste_sweet_5327.png]

  body: "What a novel take on blackletter David.  Could the bowls be a bit tighter
    horizontally? And has the O the same axis as the l.c. letters.  Give us some more
    letters in context please! I am curious as to how you will resolve the x now that
    I have seen the s. Do not get me wrong the s is identifiable. I think you are
    off to a good start.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I like it a lot, too, though I would also like the bowls to be tighter. Is
    the baseline purposefully irregular (especially in the "s" and "w," but it occurs
    throughout)?

  body: "I'm still working out a lot of the most basic aspects of this face. There's
    no uniform axis or scale yet so what you're seeing is more or less a compilation
    of ever-so-slightly homogenized individual sketched letterforms. In creating a
    'romanized' blackletter I've deliberately kept myself from moving in the direction
    of narrow counters because I feel like that's one of the main reasons why blackletter
    appears so formal and non-conversational. (So rather than tighten the bowls much,
    I'm working on seeing the rest of the glyphs expand slightly to accommodate.)\r\nThis
    experiment started with the simple idea that suspended masses imply lines; but
    through the course of it I've been taken by the beauty of blackletter and have
    begun moving this project toward a more accessible blackletter roman. It's produced
    some pretty fun caps as well; on their way."

  body: "I agree that Blackletter can be a bear to read. Keep experimenting... in
    a load of text it will be very apparent that the the bowls are in fact too wide
    (to intimate the join). As to the axis you can straighten it up later; (but) I
    try early on to do this because you have to reshape things when you skew. I had
    my own battles, see P22 Sting. I still want to know what you do with the x. ;

    still. I think I like the idea of the caps and lowercase on slightly different
    axes. Lined up, the caps tend to blend in a bit much."

  body: "David\r\n\r\nIn calligraphic works, to create a bounce all you have to do
    is bump the letters up and down a tiny bit. Overkill is easy. Subtle is hard but
    effective.\r\n\r\nWhen I have to squint to identify the bowl letters or the n
    then you have gone too far. You will, I am sure, come to this conclusion in time.
    But you do not see it yet. Even in Blackletter the space between the forms is
    roughly equivalent to the counter space! That is where the term \"picket fence\"
    texture comes from! Kerning is a combination of both letter AND interior shape
    spacing. Look at coexistence... The wide open disruptive spaces are in fact your
    counters. As far as the Axis of the caps... either go parallel or diametrically
    opposed, i.e. vertical. Don't pussy foot around.\r\n\r\nIt is all about subtle
    subtle subtle. Not what is said but what is not said. You're on your own!\r\n\r\nThis
    has potential. by the way you pulled off the x, a bit wide but identifiable.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Michael. Thanks; I really appreciate your criticism, and I agree that I've
    gone too far. Beyond legible. <em>Then why are you doing it?</em> Because it makes
    sense to me\u2014for some reason. Maybe I just like the idea that this type slows
    people down and makes him or her look at every letter. And I think you're right;
    that I'll grow out of it.\r\nThe Xs really were difficult. What's been more difficult
    has been symbols. # and + are all about this idea of piercing planes, which I've
    nearly illegalized in my visual language."

  body: "My apologies Miss Tiffany. That is still an acceptable word here in the South,
    it has no derogatory connotations at all. \r\n\r\nDavid\r\nBy the way, I like
    the way you have altered the terminal angles. It is a fresh take. I hope you saw
    the praise as well as the \"criticism.\" Did not mean to sound harsh if I did.
    Neugebauer used to do blackletter with a pointed brush and if I am not mistaken
    the terminals were opposite.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I use the word criticism in the strictly positive sense. Yes, the praise is
    evident, and no, I didn't sense a harsh tone to your remarks at all. Thank you.

  body: "I didn't realize how regional that phrase was either. I read it as equivalent
    to don't \"fool around\". Interesting. \r\n\r\nIt seems like there is a wellspring
    of interest in design that takes a little from stencils and a little from black
    letter, and a little from an industrial aesthetic, and perhaps a bit from unger/noordzij/dutch
    style. \r\n\r\nI confess, I have something like this under wraps too. But now
    I have seen 2 other projects similar to mine. It's great fun to be able to see
    the ways in which this ( and they ) flow in and out of these influences.  \r\n\r\nI
    really like the effective tension you have going on. "

    My post graduate daughter uses it to chide her med student  boyfriend into action.
    Ain't it cool that my daughter is a control freak like her daddy. Sigh! And she

    the same axis but condense the caps the gap use is more consistent. Or not."
