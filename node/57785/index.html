  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

I collected my courage (as we say that in Holland) and I posted my font here.
It's my first some kind of Sans-Serif-Display-OpenType font, based on circles and rectangulars and other shapes. Most drawn with FontCreator (my previous font maker program).
 
Here's an (older) image, which I made with Illustrator at school:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geometro_4120.PNG]

 
I've made a little test specimen, which I added in my attachment. Not all glyphs are listed, but it contains Latin, wide range of accented letters, Greek, Cyrillic, Small Caps and more.
I think I need to get InDesign somewhere and learn how to use, because PowerPoint (2007) can't access my OpenType glyphs and alternates, etc.

Please note:
- I'm 15 years old, so big way to go and enhance.
- Never had any lessons on type designing.
- My first "meeting" with FontLab Studio.
- My first OpenType project.


Thanks for your replies!

Kind regards,
Martijn van Berkel</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Martijn,

Nice to see you getting into font-design at such a young age. For a first attempt this looks really nice, and certainly very complete! 

There are a couple of points I'd like to address, but they all seem to have the same origin; you following your grid very strictly (something I do too sometimes). But as you said you purposly based this design on geometrical forms, so I guess they are not really <em>flaws</em>. And all I will suggest to take a good look at how a font like Century Gothic (also based on geometrical shapes) sometimes breaks the grid a little to make sure there is not too much negative space between the glyphs, ensuring everything fits together a bit better.

Succes ermee!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Martijn,

I agree with Wouter above me, nice that you're exploring type design at your age. How did you get interested in it? Anything in particular?

I also think that you should 'let go of the grid' in certain situations. I understand that geometry is the basis of your design, but ultimately it all comes down to how it <em>looks optically</em>. You'll see that well known geometric typefaces, like Avant Garde or Futura aren't actually completely geometric. 

For example, the strokes of the bowls in those typefaces taper when they meet the stem (where the rounds meet the straights the lines get thinner), to make sure that no 'black blobs' appear. That's one of many details you can use to make sure everything looks balanced.

Another thing you should probably take a look at are the dimensions of certain characters; some of them are very wide, while others are too narrow. This is probably also something that you can solve by letting go of the grid. For example:

lowercase:
- The f is too wide on the top
- The h is quite wide (so the m, n and u as well)
- The ear of the r is also very wide
- The s is too narrow, and the spine (the middle part) could be a bit more smooth
- The t is too wide
- The v, w and z are probably also slightly too wide

uppercase:
- The top bowl of the B should be slightly narrower, so that they are optically equal. As you can see now, the top bowl looks larger than the bottom one, eventhough they are the same size.
- A, H, M, U, W, X, Y, Z are too narrow
- L is too wide
- S spine again could be a bit more smooth

numbers:
- 3 top should be smaller, it now looks larger eventhough it isn't
- 4 the crossbar (horizontal) should probably come down
- 5 the bottom part should be larger / top is too high
- 8 same as 3, top probably too large, make them optically the same

I would just take a look at Futura, and the dimensions of its characters in relation to each other. Not to copy them, but to learn from.

Veel succes! :)</div>

Welcome in the wonderful world of typeface. Always redo the work to try to do better than before. ;^)

Do not discourage you, put away for a while and see it later with new eyes, you will see lots of thinks that you would not see at the first sight. Keep going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Quincunx: I will improve most of the things you mentioned, but those ears of the "r" and the "f" i.e., I think they give some unique style to Geometro. But to not dissatisfy you, I will include alternates of them. Maybe I'll put those f's and r's with big ears in a alternate, perhaps that give it a more accesible sans look. :)

DanGayle: Thanks for your reply, and you don't have to wait that long, because in the Netherlands you are allowed to drink beer from 16 years old. ;)


The font is of course not finished. I already discovered some missing glyphs (accented "y"'s and "w"'s) and some artifacts in some glyphs. I will do my best to make a nice, for me first, professional font. :)
