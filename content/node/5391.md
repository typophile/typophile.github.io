  making a custom bass guitar with an inlay in mother of pearl between the pickups
  on black. The inlay is in remembrance of the customer&#39;s mother, Kay. At first
  this didn&#39;t seem to be a difficult task, we inlay names all the time.  <BR>
  <BR>But Kay is especially difficult.  <BR> <BR>Anything that looked &#34;pretty&#34;
  we encountered the descender of the y clashing with the K. Without any other contextual
  clues, many ideas looked like initials KAY.  <BR> <BR>Here is the original concept:

  alt="kay2"> <BR>#2 <BR>Didn&#39;t like the new y at all, but the rest he was satisfied
  with. So we tried a new one that he likes: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39458.jpg"
  alt="kay3"> <BR>#3 <BR>But now I need to make the final drawing for the inlay artist.  Before
  I plunk a few hours into the artwork, I&#39;m looking for any suggestions. I&#39;m
  especially bothered by the large difference in the negative spaces between the letters.
  It especially shows up in  a mock up with the materials: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39459.jpg"
  alt="mockup"> <BR> <BR>Many of the forms have to remain somewhat chunky to reduce
  the chance of snapping the shell while cutting with the saw. Ends can finish to
  a very sharp point, but a thin isthmus &#40;like the bar on an A&#41; is very fragile. '

  body: 'Mica, this is a fascinating process. <BR> <BR>First, some Suggestions: You
    may find that increasing the size of the A and Y helps generally. The other thing
    that I see, is that the Y doesn&#39;t really &#39;match&#39;. Perhaps reshaping
    the Y would help. I would be tempted to try recalling the shape of the leg of
    the K or the bulgy left side of the A and applying it on the left arm of the Y
    or its tail. I also think that the A if made larger would create a nice spade
    shaped negative space with the foot of the K. <BR> <BR>BTW: you&#39;ll find faster
    uptake if you need input about specifics if you post in Critique, but this shows
    process a lot so the cross-over is natural. <BR> <BR>Now some Questions, if you
    have the time: <BR>Just how large is a design like this? Must it fit between/in
    a fret &#40;no I don&#39;t know the proper way to refer to this...&#41; and just
    how wide is that? Do you have difficulty if a name or word exceeds a certain size
    i.e. William - would that have to be reduced to Will? Could you do William small
    enough to fit within a fret? <BR> <BR>You mention that thin isthmus would present
    a problem, but sharp points are fine. Can you share the reason for this? <BR>
    <BR>I think the hand drawn curviness is neat, especially when I imagine it in
    the context of a curvy guitar. I like the hint of Rolling Stone. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: 'Thanks for your input, Jon. The y has been the stumbling block on this project.
    None of us at the shop are happy with it either, so at least I&#39;m glad to know
    we&#39;re not alone in our opinion. Back to the drawing board! <BR> <BR>The Critique
    area seems more specifically gears toward font creation, and so I wasn&#39;t sure
    where it would fit in there, but yes, I notice that region gets alot more attention.  <BR>
    <BR>The design has to fit between the pickups on a bass guitar. It&#39;s sort
    of an unusual location. This area is about 2 inches high and 5 inches wide. It&#39;s
    placed under the strings where the player&#39;s right hand plucks the strings.  <BR>
    <BR>Depending on where we put the inlay, there are limitations on size. A common
    place to put a decorative inlay is the 12th fret - it&#39;s the center of the
    string and marks the octave. It&#39;s a small space, typically only 5/8 x 2 inches
    on a guitar and 7/8 x 2-1/4 inches on a 4-string bass. You can&#39;t go to the
    edges, the designs look better with a buffer sround them. You have to consider
    where the string will fall once they&#39;re installed too.  <BR> <BR>If a name
    or other personalization would be too big to inlay, we  engrave mother of pearl
    scrimshaw style. That allows finer detail than you can do in a regular inlay.  <BR>
    <BR>The sharp points aren&#39;t a problem since after we saw the inlay, it&#39;s
    filed smooth. You can do some amazing things with tiny files. Here&#39;s a picture
    of Mike filing a Roman numeral I: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39558.jpg"

    mounted before actually inlaying them in the fingerboard: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39559.jpg"
    alt="golden mother of pearl r.n."> <BR> <BR>Little thin places are prone to cracking.
    Either in sawing, filing, handling or glue-in. This is an example of one that
    cracked on installation: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39560.jpg"

    <BR>That&#39;s so much closer to sculpting type than a lot of modern typographers
    get. <BR> <BR>I see the break between the a and m. What do you do when that happens
    on installation? Do you take it out and cut a new one and re-install it? What
    about the glue? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know why more people aren&#39;t swarming
    around here...this definitely has chirographic heritage but the cutting of the
    inlays and the fact that you embed letters into insturments is just so...so...well
    COOL...I love this.

  body: 'Mica <BR> <BR>Your project is very appealing, both as a type project and
    an instrument. <BR> <BR>Have you tried: tilting the downstoke of the A just slightly
    off the vertical toward the Y and then swelling the downstroke of the Y to make
    more of a U shape. This would help to reduce the neg space between the two letters.
    I don&#39;t find the neg sapce between K and A to much. <BR> <BR>I am an amateur
    jazz cornet player, and I love working with wood, so I sort of fell into starting
    to build a steel string acoustic guitar. I don&#39;t know how to play the guitar,
    but I didn&#39;t see that as any reason not to make one. I will see if I can learn
    how to play basic rhythm once it&#39;s finished. <BR> <BR>My point: you might
    consider getting your hands on a small pantographic engraving machine. The manual
    models are now quite cheap, since the industry is switching to computer assisted
    models. <BR> <BR>The advantage to the pantograph is that you can work large to
    start. Your tight pencil drawing is photocopied into a good quality Strathmore
    2-ply bristol, and you cut it out cleanly with a sharp X-Axto knife. You can save
    the negative area and this becomes the pattern fpr the sink that you will be cutting.
    Both parts are pasted to a thick matte board as separate pieces; positive and
    negative. <BR> <BR>These two are traced witha stylus on the panto as whatever
    reduction you require, and you cut about 1/64&#34; in depth into a good rigid
    material like aluminum plate or some workable metal. This is the working pattern.
    You make a working pattern for both the sink and the inlay material. If you use
    the same sized cutter for both patterns, they will be very accurate and precise.
    <BR> <BR>Once you have the two working patterns made, these fit onto the pantograph
    separately and you then make the sink in the guitar material, whether it&#39;s
    wood or phenolic or whatever. Next you angrave the inlay material using the same
    cutter and the fit is perfect. <BR> <BR>To make it stable and unmoving the inlay
    material is glued to heavy laminated chipboard with white glue and left to dry
    a few hours. Ths piece goes on the panto for cutting. <BR>When you are finsished
    you can lift the inlay by soaking until it releases from the cardboard material.
    If you want a little loosensess to the fit of the sink and the inlay this can
    be done by tweaking the size of the stylus that you use when cutting the sink,
    and the hole will come out a few thou, more open to let the inlay pop in so that
    it is not so tight as to crack when you are apressing it in. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    tried this with some rigid plstic in place of the abalone that I intend to use,
    and it cuts ok but it could be a little less gummy for better results. Pearl or
    abalone should cut very cleanly. With this method you can have considerably finer
    lines &#40;the cross stroke in the A in KAY&#41;. <BR> <BR>You will not lose the
    handmade feeling in you work by doing it this way, it will just give you work
    more refinement. <BR> <BR>If this is not too nutty for you, email me and I will
    give you some leads on what to look for and where. <BR> <BR>By the way; if you
    look up the ATypI 2004 on the web you will see a photospread that John Hudson
    did on my cutting of the keepsake for the Conf. This will give you some idea of
    the process if you are not familiar with it. <BR> <BR>I find it nice that so many
    of us do other things along with typography, and that makes this Forum so much
    more fun than simply talking shop. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR>'

    the AY is a great. <BR> <BR>Mica, in addition, consider ending the left leg of
    the A at the baseline. That will better frame the design between the swash leg
    of the K and the tail of the Y. Rotate the K 180 degrees as a starting place for
    your Y &#40;this is what Jim is talking about giving the Y a more U shape&#41;.  <BR>

    but not lose the funky hand drawn aspect and the original character of my mom&#39;s
    letters.  <BR> <BR>Jon - when something breaks on install, we have to explain
    to the customer about the upcoming delay. In the case above, he decided it was
    so minor he wanted to keep it the way it was. That inlay is only about an inch
    across &#40;and it&#39;s under the strings&#41;. Otherwise, it must be removed
    with a rotary cutter and a new inlay gets made. There can be casualties all along
    the way.  <BR> <BR>We almost always hand letter the designs. We might start with
    a font to get some general proportions, but since we&#39;re custom making everything,
    we figure even the lettering should be unique and reflect the individual we&#39;re
    making it for. <BR> <BR>The most common inlay is initials. This is KP in Elvish:
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39768.jpg" alt="KP">
    <BR>The oval is a sterling silver wire and the letters are cut from mother of
    pearl.  <BR> <BR>And in this design, the customer&#39;s initials DE were incorporated
    with a bass clef: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39769.jpg"
    alt="DEdance"> <BR>He sent in a rough sketch of his idea, then we worked it to
    the final design. The oval is ebony with sterling silver wire. The bass clef is
    golden mother of pearl. The E and the stem of the D are  black Tahitian mother
    of pearl.  <BR> <BR>Just about everyone here is considered a designer. My mom,
    Susan, is the lead designer. On a given project, we toss around ideas until we
    figure who will be best suited to do the design, and to execute the inlay itself.
    I usually get type related projects since that&#39;s a special interest of mine.  <BR>
    <BR>We have been commissioned to exuecute other artist&#39;s designs, but we still
    need to adapt them to suit the medium. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the questions

  body: Mica, I like the direction that the Y has taken. Trust Randy Jones. &#40;That
    <b>is</b> an instruction&#41;. To my eye it could be a little heavier or more
