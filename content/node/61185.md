  and has a lovely rounded form with curved lines making it really striking and different.\r\n\r\nYou
  can find it here\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://fontfabric.com/?p=585\r\n\r\nIts seems to look
  really good in simple short forms of type. Perfect for logos or headlines, though
  the legibility is not amazing, but hey, its not really about that!\r\n\r\nI also
  love the way it is displayed on this site. Gives good examples, but also shows the
  font as an alphabet form in posters with 4 fonts per page. I think this is a really
  interesting and original way of showing a font. It also directly shows you how effective
  it is in simple form.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope you think its as nice as I do.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/002_5198.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/006_6017.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/valmilk1_6260.jpg]"
