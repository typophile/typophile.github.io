body: "hello! \r\ni'm a design student and am hoping to learn bits and pieces from
  typophile - I do not have a great deal of knowledge on typography. I am currently
  working on a project focusing on typographic characters, their visual characteristics,
  history and contemporary use. At the moment I have chosen to concentrate on the
  ampersand looking at ways I can use various styles of the ampersand to illustrate
  famous pairings that we recognise eg. laurel & hardy, strawberries & cream... and
  so on. I just thought I'd post here to see what people think about this? if you
  have any pairings you would like to share? plus, if you know of any typefaces with
  interesting ampersands that would be great [although my budget is pretty tight :(
  ] cheers!"

    and Cleopatra.
