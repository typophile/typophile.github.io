  have this wordmark that I need to make adjustments too, but have no idea what typefaces
  they are, and the previous designer didn't leave me any files that weren't outlined.\r\n\r\nI
  went to whatthefont.com and it identified the top typeface as Silverscreen. Does
  that sound right?\r\n\r\nBut I still don't know what the bottom one is.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.\r\n\r\nBryan"

    Bold</a>, as the one in the second line, but over streched.\r\nNot sure though,
    a bigger sample of the bottom one would be better."
