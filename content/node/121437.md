  body: "Had no luck finding something that completely matched Bakery. These two typefaces
    get most of it right, save for the squared-off |B| and |R|, and the fully flat-topped
    |A|:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/abril-titling/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/trivia-serif-10/\r\n\r\nI
    found a similar |B| in a typeface that used to be offered by Linotype, Myfonts,
    and Fontshop, but now I can only find dubious sources for it:\r\nhttp://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Napoleon-Light-Bold\r\n\r\nIbis,
    by Font Bureau, might be helpful for the |B| and |A| as well:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ibis-display/
    \r\n\r\nThorowgood also gets the flat-topped |A|, slab serifs, and the curly-footed
    |R| right, and would only require some artificial widening and some squaring off
    of the |B| and |R|:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/wooden-type-foundry/thorowgood/regular\r\n\r\nThese
    might work for Restaurant:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Alcalde/fonts/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/westside/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/french-clarendon-n2/\r\n\r\nAhrens
    is most definitely hand-lettered, but these script faces capture the same general
    feel:\r\nhttp://www.chank.net/freefont_detail.php?sku=1080\r\nhttp://artandsignstudio.com/signwriter.html\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/az+cupcakes/fonts/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/no.-seven/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/wonder-brush/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/praise/

  body: "BAKERY is interesting. Some letters are almost a perfect match for Abril
    Titling Bold but the bowls on _B_ and _R_ are squared in a style developed by
    Imre Reiner as Corvinus in 1929-34. So what changes to Abril would produce an
    alphabet that was consistent with BAKERY?\r\nConsider Abril Titling Bold BRSPDCG
