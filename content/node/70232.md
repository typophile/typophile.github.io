  (book covers, advertisements, etc.), and I'm curious to know what its name is. Can
  anyone help me out?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font example1_3494.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font
  example 2_4621.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font example 3_6564.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  not entirely certain that the fonts in the three examples I provide here are the
  same, but to me they do look very much alike. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
