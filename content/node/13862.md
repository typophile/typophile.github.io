body: "I've created a custom font with TypeTool II for a book I'm working on. It has
  worked fine up until now, but the book is going into foreign translation and my
  special characters are screwed up (encoding issues). I don't have the time to figure
  this out, so I'm looking for someone who knows the program that I can pay to fix
  this.\r\n\r\nTo contact me: \r\ntoddb at beckermayer dot com\r\n\r\n"
