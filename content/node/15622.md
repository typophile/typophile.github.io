body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm using the Ambigue family for the body and head/subhead for
  a publication on consumber goods. Everything is working out great except that I
  forgot that there may be a few instances where italics are needed. Can anyone think
  of another font that is similar that I can use for the very few instances where
  italics do appear? I know it's cheating but I can't switch from Ambigue now. Your
  help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTammy"
