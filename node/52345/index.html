  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm doing a poster for Austin Food Bank for my design class at Texas State. I'm setting the headline on a Campbell's soup can. I was not able to find a font that came close enough for my taste, so I'm attempting to mimic the script. I don't have any experience lettering so let me know what you think. The Headline Reads 

The Bank 
That Deserves A
Bail Out.

I wanted to wait for some opinions before I started the T so I used commercial script as a place holder</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Super headline. Is this one of a series? If so what are the other lines? (there's probably a TARP line to be discovered)

The h-e combo is a bit awkward since the original e is a result of the high join with the b. But I wouldn't worry about it since it's a campbell's distinctive.
Rather than set the whole headline in Campbell's script, consider using all the type on the can (you may already be doing this). 
Eg:
"Campbells" => The Bank 
"CONDENSED" => THAT DESERVES
"Cream of Mushroom => A Bail Out 

Don't forget to show us the final result.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the good suggestions. Because my deadline was the 10th I didn't change much on the type, but I do think I will ditch the high join on the h-e like was suggested and  try one where they are connected at the bottom. 

Randy: it's not a series right now but I could see it a couple of ways it could be. Glad to see we were on the same page about using the same type as on the can. I omitted the SOUP face because it would have been clunky.

Here it is, besides the h-e which I plan to fix, let me know what you think. Suggestions for the T?

		<div class="commentbody">I think the stem and crossbar of the T should be joined. That would start making it match the B better. If you want to go further perhaps try making the crossbar a bit longer on the right side so it is over the h more, and think about the relationship between it and the angle of the top of B.

Nice work. Have you tried printing the label and photographing it around an actual can? A whole stack of these would look great especially if a few were slightly dented.</div>
