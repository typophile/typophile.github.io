  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to identify the font on the top. The one on the bottom is
  clearface. They definately have similar characteristics, but the stems are missing
  and some of the accents are different. Any Ideas?

  body: If I may be more precise, the one on the bottom is Clearface Gothic. This
    reminded me of a recent fascinating <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21890.html"
    target="_blank">thread involving Phil Martin&#39;s Agenda</a>, which was a Clearface
    Gothic spinoff/enhancement, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the answer to this
    post. <BR> <BR>After consulting with the Sans Serif ID Guide I came up with <a

    target="_blank">FF Dax</a>, which I think is your mystery font.
