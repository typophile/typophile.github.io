  body: "The \"I have a headeache\" line looks similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/|Century
    751]] (Primer), based on the smaller tail of the 'a'.\r\n\r\n'help' reminds me
    of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/binary-itc/|ITC Binary]], but I see
    they are not the same.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    from Brassfonts. It's also possible someone edited off the serifs from another
    font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
