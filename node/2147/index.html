The scan is from a predictably wonderful article by Ovink in an old issue of Quaerendo, which also happens to have a reference to that superb Deberny font that came up in the Javal thread. Apparently there was a reaction to all the Didone typography during the bulk of the 19th century, and this design was one of the seminal works in the resultant &#34;old-style&#34; revival, which was however superceded by Morris&#39;s Arts &amp; Crafts revival soon afterwards. Shame, since I think the A&amp;C stuff was somewhat provincial, or at least naive. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

As for &#34;y&#34;, that skewed thick arm does look funny, but ever since I saw it in that Deberny #17/#18&#42; I&#39;ve actually liked it. It seems to be a weight distribution scheme. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif" target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif</a> <BR>I&#39;d make the &#34;v&#34; symmetrical however. <BR> <BR>The spacing though seems a bit loose in spots &#40;although apparently this design was considered tight for its era&#41;, but being metal makes it harder to space with consistent tightness. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">What you mean by  <BR>&#34;the elzevir stuff isn&#39;t really the same as Morris&#39;s.&#34; <BR> <BR>For Ponot, Mandel and others, Perrin and Jannet are the first revival of Old Style typefaces, long long before Morris and others. Just that part of history generally don&#39;t appear on standard Anglo-US typography books. <BR> <BR>For Perrin its pretty clear, as described by Ponot in its 2 books. He wanted typefaces who by its forms reflect old text he want to publish. 19th typefaces don&#39;t fitted well, so he tried to find old typefaces, and used one existing old italic, and designed a Roman lc to fit with. Its caps are already done to do the titling for his HUGE book on Roman Lyon Inscriptions. I describe the Italic as a pure Garalde, when the Roman is more an Incised Garalde, perhaps the first text face of the category at this time? <BR> <BR>Perrin was one of the first typefaces revival done at the original ANCT &#40;Imprimerie nationale&#41;, roughly 1987 by Jean Renaud Cuaz and Ronan Le Henaff under the direction of Mandel. Then, later later, the Imprimerie Nationale asked to Franck Jalleau, their in-house type designer to do a digital version who is used ONLY in the Ponot book you refer. <BR> <BR>About Jannet, there is less stuff about it. Gerard unger refered to it several time, as a French &#34;Gout Hollandois&#34;! <BR>I have here a couple of Biblioth</div>
