    past 2 years) but I agree that the 'R' is a different font or even custom drawn.\r\n\r\n

  body: "<em>\"\u201Ctake me fishing\u201D = Marydale ?\"</em>\r\n\r\nAlmost. One
    of the i's doesn't match the other and the 'g' is different from the alternate
    'g' in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/3ip/marydale/black/charmap.html\">Marydale</a>.
    (The basic Marydale 'g' is a signature letter, nothing like the one used here).\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi Guys:\r\n\r\nI already try Marydale, but the \"g\" doesn't match, I'm
    pretty sure that this font was used as a base to create the line, but I still
    don't undestand why changing that particular character...\r\n\r\nI'll take a \"dive\"
    into the free font sites to see if I can get the actual font...\r\n\r\nThanks!!
    I'll be around...\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 Says: It's all about the Fonts!!"

  body: "Hi Q,\r\n\r\nThe normal (default) 'g' with Marydale could be considered a
    bit distracting, so maybe they decided to soften the look by using an alternate
    letter. As I explained above, there is another 'g' as an alternate character embedded
    in the Marydale font, and it's very similar to the one used in 'take me fishing'.
    For some reason it seems they drew another one, or modified that one.\r\n\r\n-
