body: Hello folks, <BR>This will no doubt be easy for someone here but is frustrating
  the @#$&#42; out of me. Looks familiar but I can&#39;t pick it. Font ID software
  doesn&#39;t even come close so I am guessing it is a recent font &#40;2003-2005?&#41;...

  body: Yeah, it&#39;s just out of my reach too. <BR> <BR>Closest I turned up is <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/plus-sans/normal-regular/testdrive.html?s=NASCENT+Organic+Vitality&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Plus Sans</a> but it&#39;s not an exact match. I&#39;m sure one
    of the wizards here will get this one in a second.

  body: This type ID actually caught my eye because at first I thought it was indeed
    Botanika - one of my personal favorites. The lowercase a, i, t and &#40;arguably
    at least&#41; y resemble the corresponding letters in Botanika standard roman
    &#40;first sample below&#41;; while oddly, the lowercase g and l resemble the
    corresponding letters in Botanika alternate &#40;second sample&#41;. The other
    letters are a fairly close match in both versions. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70782.jpg"

    target="_blank">Insider Regular Roman</a> <BR> <BR>Where is this sample from?
    Is it a magazine? If so, it may be a custom font, which would explain why the
    experts are stumped.
