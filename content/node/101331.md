body: "BACKGROUND:  \r\nDuring the last few decades Greek typography has been strongly
  influenced by Latin elements. Often, there is substitution of Greek letters by Latin
  ones. A few designers try to preserve characteristic Greek typographic elements
  into their work, but overall Greek typography appears to trend towards Latin assimilation.\r\n\r\nAIMS:
  \ \r\na) To define what constitutes Greek characteristics in a font,\r\nb) To delineate
  the needs and problems faced by contemporary Greek typography end-users (graphic
  designers, book publishers of Greek texts, etc.)\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY QUESTIONS:  \r\na)
  How do you define or how do you approach the issue of a Greek characteristic in
  a font?\r\nb) What questions would you have for end-users of your fonts? \r\nc)
  Why do you design Greek fonts?\r\n\r\nP.S. The results of this study, including
  all information from font-designers and end-users, will be posted in this blog in
  the end of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      To me calligraphy fails to promote -and in fact essentially opposes- functional
      or cultural progress in type design.<\r\n\r\nI would be very interested in reading
      your point of view about this. Could you explain your statment, please? \r\nIf
      I understood correct, looking back to early Greek typography opresses the progress
      of Greek font design? (and I suppose you are speaking about the calligraphy
      of any other language)\r\n\r\nThe history of Greek typography reveals the big
      impact of byzantine scripts in the design of Greek fonts. While the latin typography
      evolved through a different path and always seemed modern. Based on which criteria
      could anyone desing a modern Greek font, but not using elements from calligraphic
      manuscripts? \r\n\r\nI am not an expert at all, but it seems to me that some
      recent fonts have quite a contemporary look based on byzantine roots\u2026 What
      do you think? \r\nSee Maiola, Skolar, Colvert \r\nhttp://rosettatype.com/index.php?action=carro/search_by_kw&kwId=3&kwName=greek\r\nhttp://www.typographies.fr/uk/index.php?page=fontes&s=Colvert\r\n\r\nAlso,
      I see a preference in \"calligraphic\" Greek fonts which are more suitable for
      extended texts, because they have \"fluidity\", while the modern ones are static
      and \"printed\" rather than \"written\". Should we change our attitude towards
      letters? To accept that they are not written anymore, but designed on a computer? "

  body: "I am not a native speaker of Greek, so I cannot speak to the issue in a way
    useful to you. But I am curious about your findings.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of
    the situation is that Greek typography is weakly developed due to the long period
    of Turkish rule, when printing in the Greek language was suppressed.\r\n\r\nThus,
    it came to be that most readily available Greek typefaces were designed in Latin
    alphabet nations for use in study of the New Testament or the classics - or for
    use in mathematical formulae. The latter application led to the infamous Porson
    typeface, long the standard for Greek, where the upper case was upright and very
    much like that of Latin, while the lower case was cursive... and italicized.\r\n\r\nThe
    upper and lower case of the Latin alphabet are based on a compounding of Roman
    capitals with the uncial script done at the behest of Charlemagne, but over hundreds
    of years, the two scripts achieved a unity and complementarity - for most categories
    of typeface, this process seems less far along in Greek.\r\n\r\nThe Cyrillic alphabet,
    based on the Greek alphabet, of course, illustrates what a completely Latinized
    Greek script might look like. On the other hand, most of the typefaces designed
    to be based on authentic Greek sources are sans-serif - and the advantages of
    serifs for legibility are well-known.\r\n\r\nSo I suspect that typography in the
    Greek language faces many contradictions - and its difficulties, compared to the
    success of the Latin script, makes borrowing and assimilation a strong temptation.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I've seen the substitution of the Latin capital Y for the Greek Upsilon (\u03A5).
    The font used <em>here</em> does that! I suppose people could also use W for Omega,
    but I can't think of any other replacements (not counting digamma and qoph)."

  body: "> great taste for sweets\r\n\r\nactually, I have even more taste for other
    sweet things in life :-) like spicy type \r\n\r\nBut now, seriously. The decision
    to support the polytonic range of characters is not just meant to be an advantage,
    but is clearly aimed at a specific user group: scholars of the classics who just
    need this entire set. As far as I can tell, Andron Greek is used more outside
    Greece by editors and scholars than by Greek customers.\r\nLatinization. This
    is one of the most fascinating topics in type, actually. (By the way, one can
    cross-flavour every script with whatsoever writing style, you can do a chinese-looking
    Latin or an Arabic-looking Cyrillic; a Chinese blackletter face has been done
    recently\u2026 so far the game of it.)\r\nThe greek minuscule got under Latin
    pressure over the last 15 years not only because there was some wishful mood of
    getting Greek \u2018modernized\u2019 \u2013 whatever this may imply. More than
    that we still see (and feel?) that the Latin and the Greek letters are basically
    identical. So the wish *to see either alphabet on the same level* seems natural.
    Not to forget that both capital alphabets co-exist as close kin without the medieval-age
    metamorphosis history of the minuscules, to the day. \r\nSo the Latin journey
    of Greek was inevitable. When I started to work on Andron Greek I thought \u201Cmake
    it look like Latin\u201D in order to get a harmonized overall appearance. (I never
    intended to stick to one of the historic models like Garamond or Didot Greek.)
    The result was perfect: you couldn\u2019t even spot a few greek phrases interspearsed
    in a Latin text because the likeness was extreme. But then I learned \u2013 again:
    inevitably! \u2013 that my achievement was \u2018too much of a good thing\u2019,
    the Greekness got lost and that was just bad. So I reworked it, several times.
    And I went back the path from Greekness to Latinitas, step by step. I found an
    old review image of that process, versions A to D in time order:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Greek_ABCD_6191.png]\r\nAs
    you see I came quite back home to Hellas with the latest version D. But I was
    still not convinced. Some details were now \u201Ctoo Greek\u201D \u2013 no. Not
    too Greek but too cursive, too scripty. The more traditional reverse contrast
    pattern (lambda, chi) did not fit in. I now knew I wanted it not more Latin, but
    more smart. And I compiled another version (M) from the previous ones:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Greek_M_kl_6361.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    still this was not the end. At least three more versions got tested.\r\nAfter
    a year something very important happened: I was in Greece :-) (in Saloniki, actually).
    And I digged in the very life of Greek type: newspapers, shopfronts, the wonderful
    \u03BA\u03B1\u03B9, menus, even silly espresso cups.\r\nWhen I was back I screwed
    up the font again and did those version which remained the valid one till today:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/and-gre-final_6628.png]\r\n\r\nI
    know that the result does not convince everyone. But the font found its way into
    use and that tells me that the solution is a possible one.\r\n\r\npostscriptum.
    Last year I enjoyed visiting Corfu. I learned that the island, although belonging
    to Greece and being populated by Greeks, is rather Italian by kind of its fauna
    and style of its architecture. I found this most remarkable.\r\n"

    intervention introduced 'calligraphy' into this discussion, but I would prefer
    to return to the framework of Tatiana's original query. I don't consider any of
    my Greek types 'calligraphic'. The one that might seem on first glance to most
    obviously display calligraphic characteristics -- the Gabriola display face --
    is actually the one that I created with least reference to scribal models, even
    less, it might surprise to learn, than the Helvetica World Greek.\r\n\r\nSo, some
    comments on how I 'define or ... approach the issue of a Greek characteristic
    in a font':\r\n\r\nI think Tatiana is correct to say that the history of Greek
    typography reveals the strong influence of the Byzantine scribal hands. It is
    not the only influence: one sees sometimes reference to archaic styles, especially
    in display typography, and the Complutensian and related pre-Aldine types saw
    revival in the 19th and 20th Centuries (ignoring for now the importation of styles
    from other scripts as in the blackletter and woodtype examples shown in this thread).
    Overall, though, the Byzantine style has been the dominant influence, but not
    simply in terms of its most obvious historical stylistic aspects: intensive ligation
    and contraction, cursiveness, varying contrast patterns, etc., which frequently
    blind people to its most lasting influence. It is within this style that the Greek
    lowercase letters came into existence and persist in being written up to and through
    the introduction of type and print publishing. So it is entirely ordinary that
    it should have become the dominant model, just as the relatively unligated, formal
    and more regularised humanist book hand should have become the dominant model
    for Latin type: typography pretty much everywhere picks up whatever is the main
    scribal book hand of the day and runs with it.\r\n\r\nWhen I am designing type,
    I'm generally thinking mostly about structure and texture rather than style. So
    the questions I ask myself are not about what consitute 'Greek characteristics'
    but about the structure of Greek letters and how these create a particular texture
    on the page that I associate with 'Greekness'.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, I designed the
    Constantia family for Microsoft, which was the last time I tried to harmonise
    Greek and Latin designs through stroke contrast pattern. There were a few reasons
    for this, one of which was that the ClearType rendering environment for which
    the types were designed is much more forgiving of thin horizontals and thick verticals
    than vice versa. At the same time, there are some Latinised contrast patterns
    in the Greek lowercase that I really find totally unconvincing -- too far removed
    from the historical evolution of the letter shapes --, so in Constantia there
    is a mix of contrast patterns (compare pattern of \u03BF with that of \u03C0 and
    \u03C4; note pattern of \u03BB). As I say, it is the last time I tried this approach,
    and Constantia Greek is my least favourite of my Greek designs (at least, of the
    ones I can still bear to look at). After the experience, I was left convinced
    that the shapes of the Greek lowercase letters, evolved through the Byzantine
    scribal model and its 350+ year typographic expression, naturally carry the pattern
    resulting from a more steeply held writing implement, and that this contributes
    massively to the Greekness of the texture on the page.\r\n\r\nAround the same
    time as the Constantia project, I began work on the SBL Greek type for the Society
    of Biblical Literature, and used the opportunity to renew study of Robert Granjon's
    Greek types, which I had earlier used as a model for the uncompleted, heavily-ligatured
    Clio type shown at the first ICTVC conference in Thessaloniki. For SBL Greek,
    I ditched all but two of the ligatures (\u03B3\u03B3 and \u03BB\u03BB, which have
    become a feature of most of my Greek types), but stuck very closely to scribal
    letter shapes and proportions, and the variable contrast pattern. One of the personal
    goals of the project was to get a better sense of how much of the texture of Byzantine
    manuscript and Renaissance print pages was the result of the ligation and contraction,
    and how much was the result of the lettershapes and contrast patterns. My conclusion
    -- also confirmed by my experience with lots of other writing systems -- is that
    texture is built up from layers of characteristics, beginning with relative proportions
    and letter frequencies, then stroke contrast patterns, and that these, before
    the influence of particular weights and styles, contribute to what I think of
    as the 'feel' of a particular script on the page. The observable qualities that
    constitute Greekness in both a heavily ligated page of Aldine, Grecs du Roi or
    Granjon types of the Renaissance and a mostly unligated Foulis Press edition of
    the 19th Century are the product of structure and contrast pattern.\r\n\r\nAs
    I wrote above, Gabriola is superficially 'calligraphic' in style -- which is to
    say that someone who doesn't know much about Greek calligraphy is likely to identify
    it as such --, but unlike the SBL Greek is not derived from a scribal model. The
    Gabriola Greek, because it doesn't include the same level of ornamentation options
    as the Latin and Cyrillic, includes a compensatory of ligatures to enliven things.
    But these are all what I think of as tying ligatures, i.e. in which the shapes
    of the underlying letters are not modified significantly, only linked to each
    other.\r\n\r\n[This relates back to my study of the Granjon types, in which I
    classified Renaissance Greek ligatures into two kinds: connecting and morphographic.
    <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/John/ClioDemo2.pdf\">The three pages of this PDF
    show the same passage in the Clio type with, respectively, no ligatures, connecting
    ligatures, and both connecting and morphographic ligatures.</a> In general, connecting
    ligatures present no problem for modern Greek readers, since the basic letter
    shapes are easily recognised; many of the morphographic ligatures from the Byzantine/Renaissance
    tradition present considerable problems, as a straw poll taken at the first ICTVC
    conference confirmed.]\r\n\r\nAs with the Latin and Cyrillic, the Gabriola Greek
    explores what happens to structure and texture when lettershapes traditionally
    associated with a translation stroke model are instead made with an expansion
    stroke model.\r\n\r\nGabriola is a display face, so shouldn't be taken as directly
    representing any ideas I have about Greek text types (even though we hinted it
    so that it bears up remarkably well at text sizes on screen (better than in print)).
    However, when I came to design the new Greek type for the academic publisher Brill,
    I made use of many of the same decisions that I had employed in Gabriola. My point
    of departure in this case, though, was the Didot Greek types of the 18th Century,
    which were informed by the dynamics of the contemporary split nib, and are the
    basis, via Monotype 90, for the famous <em>\u03B1\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC</em>, i.e.
    simple or normal, style of Greek literary publishing. The Brill Greeks represent
    a regularisation and softening of the stroke contrast of the Didot types, maintaining
    the traditional Byzantine patterns but applying them to less cursive, more formal
    and upright structures. For comparison, here is a characteristic Didot Greek --
    from Firmin Didot's 1828 edition of <em>L'Iliade d'Hom\xE8re</em> -- shown above
    the Brill Greek regular and bold (obviously I've got very different ideas about
    wordspacing!):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DidotBrill_5267.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    been very gratifying to see the Brill Greek in frequent use in Brill publications,
    and to note among other things that it harmonises incredibly well with the Brill
    Latin, despite a completely different ductus and contrast pattern. This confirms
    again something that I discussed during my Beatrice Warde Memorial lecture <a
    href=\"http://www.tiro.com/John/SameDifference-slides.pdf\"><em>Same Difference</em></a>
    [some corruptions in that PDF resulting in missing characters] at St Brides a
    few years ago: cross-script harmony is firstly and most importantly a matter of
    weight and proportion, rather than of ductus and contrast pattern. It is possible
    to elegantly harmonise two different writing systems together on a page without
    forcing either into the dress of the other. It is possible for both to display
    their characteristics textures on the page and still harmonise. Indeed, to take
    the notion of harmony back to its musical origins, it is possible for the two
    voices to produce beautiful harmony without one trying to sound like the other.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    a word on the earliest of my Greek designs shown here, the Helvetica World Greek
    that I designed for Linotype at the beginning of the millennium. <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/John/HelveticaGreeks.pdf\">See
    also this comparison of the design -- here under its earlier name Helvetica Linotype
    -- with Matthew Carter's original Helvetica Greek from the 1970s.</a> Some people,
    especially at the time of the release of Helvetica World, interpreted my design
    in terms of ideas about correct and incorrect ways to design Greek types, especially
    sans serif types, which I suppose relates directly to Tatiana's questions. I was
    bemused to find that I had both champions and critics in Greece, and there were
    references to the 'Hudson way' as something to be emulated or disavowed. As time
    has passed, I've tried to get away from that interpretation, and one of the things
    that I find interesting about the project is that it shows how much designing
    an extension of an existing typeface for a new script is like a work of literary
    translation: more than one translation is possible, and each is likely to respond
    to different aspects of the original. The original Helvetica Greek reflects the
    contemporary associations of Helvetica with internationalism, standardisation
    and, it must be said, westernisation; the Helvetica World design reflects my interest
    in the relationship of the mid-20th Century Swiss/German grotesk to the structures
    of 18th Century romantic types (esp. Didot and Walbaum). So my Helvetica World
    Greek is thematically related to my most recent, Brill Greek, although one might
    not guess so from a simple comparison.\r\n\r\nSo that's a longish answer to Tatiana's
    question (a).\r\n\r\nI'll give some thoughts to the other questions and try to
    respond in shorter manner."

    '...the leaders of typographic design in the fifteenth century never achieved
    for Greek what they did for Latin and modern languages' shows just how poor is
    his knowledge and superficial his analysis. In fact, the typographers of the 15th
    Century starting with Aldus achieved for Greek <em>exactly</em> what they achieved
    for Latin, i.e. the translation into type of the standard scribal book hand of
    the day. And although this cursive style became the dominant mode of typographic
    Greek, it wasn't the only mode and the non-cursive Greeks of the 15th Century
    all point to more fruitful directions in Greek type design -- as Scholderer demonstrated
    -- than Gill's embarrassing Perpetua Greek, whose only redeeming feature is that
    no one ever used it.\r\n\r\nThe thing that I find remarkable about Gill and Van
    Krimpen and others who set out to deliberately Latinise the Greek script -- whether
    they used that term or simply talk in terms of 'modernising' or 'formalising'
    --, is that they end up producing stiff, clumsy and lifeless forms that do not
    combine well, <em>of a kind that they would never accept in their Latin type designs.</em>
    It is as if they abandoned all their knowledge about what makes a typeface work,
    ignoring all that they knew from Latin script even as they try to 'Latinise' the
    Greek. So when Gill writes that 'Just as the capitals of the Perpetua Greek are
    of precisely the same family as the Perpetua Roman, so the Perpetua Greek lower-case
    is of the same family as the Perpetua Roman lower-case', my response is 'No. It
    isn't. The Perpetua Latin lowercase has life and elegance, and pleasing curves,
    and nice proportions that make the letters combine well into words. The Perpetua
    Greek has none of these characteristics.'"

    are basically identical. So the wish *to see either alphabet on the same level*
    seems natural.\r\n\r\n        In his book,\"The history of Greek script\", Antonios

    shows how the handwriting of Latin and Greek languages at one point (first centuries
    AD) were so mixed, that with difficulty anyone could distinguish them. But this
    was due to social evolutions of Roman Empire, where Greek and Roman children were
    exposed to similar educational system, so the handwriting (dimotiki) on wax tablets
    was resembling, he says. \r\nDespite this, through time, when Greek minuscule
    appeared (around 9th century AD) the letters distinguished themselves from Latin
    ones (because the Capitals of two alphabets had similarities and differences).
    [When someone tries to write fast, different alterations appear in letter forms,
    not to mention the natural conversion of upper to lower case. Try for yourself
    to write  '\u0393' and then a very quick gamma, which will evolve steadily to
    '\u03B3']. \r\n        Aldus Manutius may be criticisezed for \"negative influence\",
    but in one way his printings preserved the characteristics of Greek letters and
    thus influenced greek typography for quite a long period. The lack of political
    and economic stability in Greece for few centuries (Ottoman rulling, revolution
    of 1821, WW1, WW2, again revolution, Hounda) didn't give the opportunity to the
    Greek type to flourish, as Latin did.  Maybe this is an explanation why latin
    fonts always seemed more modern than greek and eventually dictated the style of
    contemporary fonts. \r\n\r\n        And at this point I will have the (naive?!)
    courage to put in discussion a relation of the following theory to Latinization:
    that people tend to be more open to things that they are most used to, because
    they feel more \"comfortable\", safe. \r\nHow is this related to Latinization?
    \r\nLately, my friends are asking me what project I am doing and I tell them that
    I found (yes, I too wasn't aware of it) a fenomenon concerning typography - latinization
    of greek alphabet. And they are all surprised that something like this exists,
    because is not easily perceived by society.\r\nLatinization was introduced day
    by day into Greek typography. The reader was getting used to the micro changes
    and could not see the image from another point of view, except of typographers,
    graphic designers etc. But you see, the released typefaces were read by all Greek
    speakers and not only. Unconsciously, they accepted what they were served for
    dinner. \r\n\r\nLet's see, ho\u03C9 \u03B5\u03B1s\u03B3 \u03B3\u03BF\u03C5 c\u03B1\u03B7
    r\u03B5\u03B1\u03B4 \u03C4h\u03B9\u03C2 \u03C4\u03B5\u03C7\u03C4? \r\n\r\nIf a
    English speaker is exposed for centuries to this king of metamorphosis of letters
    (which would occur with minor changes step by step), some day he will get used
    to it.  \r\nAs Matthew Carter underlines (From tablets to pixels, [1996],\" Which
    came first, the Greeks or the Romans?\" ), every epoch has its specific demands
    and people are exposed to different typographical approaches. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/carter_5262.png]\r\nIt
    would be irattional to ask from a Greek to read today the complicated word \"para-
    \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03AC\" (see the image, up center) and from an English - \"que\"
    and \"pre\", says Carter. Even if these were the most common ligatures of the
    past when people could easily read them!\r\n\r\nFor me, there are some key points
    here:\r\n1) Today, latin alphabet can be read everywere, in almost every society.
    Population is accustomed to it and as result, the phenomenon of latinization is
    unconsciously accepted.\r\n2) The written forms of an alphabet is a cultural heritage,
    is the identity of every nation and social group. Aknowledge and education can
    prevent the Latinization process.\r\n3) Even if we all agree that Latinization
    is a logical process of letter evolution, can you imagine universal type in 100
    years? It will be all the same, no difference between latin, arabic, greek, thai,
    armenian, etc.  Quite boring\u2026 and at some point, the return to roots will
    be inevitabile, I suppose. (I'm waiting for Hrant's :) critique about this) \r\n\r\nSo,
    I'm asking Andreas, \"the wish *to see either alphabet on the same level* seems
    natural\", is a intuitional statement or a unconsciously perspective directed
    from specific groups?\r\n\r\nP.S. \r\n1) John, thank you for the comments about
    Gill! :)\r\n2) Soon I will reply to other comments - specifically reffering to
    what I found about the \"characteristics of Greek letters\"\r\n3) did you know
    that in ancient times the fathers were obliged to educate their sons, otherwise
    they weren't entitled to ask for support and care when they would become old? "

    this was true until some time during the 1960s.\r\n\r\nEarly written Greek is
    almost indistinguishable from <em>Phoenician</em>, so one could argue that an

    ligature is graphically more complex than the Latin abbreviations, it is decipherable
    because the underlying letter shapes and their order can be discerned in it (the
    Latin abbreviations cannot be deciphered from their shape, and one has to learn
    their meaning in order to read them). This is true of very many of the Greek ligatures,
    although some make use of neglected variant letter shapes, as in this <em>\u03B3\u03B3</em>
    ligature\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gamma_gamma_5541.png]\r\n\r\nand
    a few obscure one or more of the underlying letter shapes almost completely, as

    letter <em>\u03B5</em> was most frequently subject to shape change in ligation.
    There are some ligatures in which it is indistinguishable from <em>\u03F2</em>
    (lunate sigma) and some in which it is reduced to a small curved stroke.]\r\n\r\nAs
    I tried to suggest in my long comment, I think the role of ligatures in terms
    of the characteristics of the Greek minuscule is easily overstated and can be
    a red herring -- as the free variant elaborations of the Arabic <em>naskh</em>
    style can be -- distracting attention from what contributes most to the characteristic
    texture of Greek on the page regardless of the presence, absence or number of
    ligatures employed. This, I maintain, is primarily the steep stroke contrast pattern
    and the letter structures that evolved from that model.\r\n\r\nSince I mentioned
    Arabic, I'll point out that my review of Byzantine manuscripts led me to conclude
    that no rules existed for where and when particular ligatures or variant forms
    were used in Greek. So, unlike much of the letter shape modification and joining
    behaviour in Arabic, which is graphotactical (representing an aspect of a consistent
    script grammar), the Greek ligatures are free variants, whose use is a matter
    of personal preference or, sometimes, text fitting. With regard to the latter,
    it is interesting to note that Granjon's smaller sizes of Greek type include more
    ligatures than his larger fonts, and when one sees these small types used in marginalia
    and footnotes one can appreciate the space-saving value of many of these ligatures.\r\n_____\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Greek
    lowercase and Greek uppercase are not harmonized; Greek lowercase essentially
    only exists in a cursive form, and so doesn't match non-cursive uppercase.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to be careful in the use of terminology here, just to be clear what we are
    talking about. The term cursive can mean running in the sense of connected letters,
    which is clearly not what we're limited to talking about when it comes to Greek
    (indeed, in this sense the Byzantine manuscript style is at most semi-cursive).
    But if we apply the term to the internal construction of individual letters, then
    yes, the dominant model of Greek minuscule is cursive, i.e. the pen is not lifted
    in the writing of most letters, but instead strokes are reversed or turned to
    form transitions, as is the case with the humanist italic letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    relationship of Greek uppercase and lowercase letters is indeed complicated by
    their separate histories, although I think it is wrong to say that they are inherently
    'not harmonised'. Better to say that they are a challenge to harmonise or, even
    more simply, that they do not harmonise in the same ways that Latin upper- and
    lowercase harmonise. The same can be said of Latin italic upper- and lowercase
    -- for exactly the same reason: uppercase letters with interrupted construction
    and lowercase letters with cursive construction --, and yet that doesn't prevent
    these being accepted as paired alphabets.\r\n\r\nWho was the first person to pair
    Greek upper- and lowercase letters as a true bicameral system? Tatiana, is this
    something that Antonios Sigalas discusses? My impression is that this was either
    a typographic innovation or, at least, contemporary with the introduction of printing.
    Byzantine manuscripts are mostly unicameral, employing only lowercase letters.
    Uppercase forms are found occasionally in them, but mostly as initials at the
    beginnings of sections or paragraphs, and not used systematically within the text.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing to point out about cursive construction is that while in Latin script it
    is associated with the informal (quickly written) scribal hands that lead to the
    italic style of typography, it is only one of the characteristics of such hands,
    and isn't necessarily linked to informality. Slant and horizontal compression
    are other characteristics of informal hands, and while these are characteristic
    of the late Byzantine manuscript styles on which Aldus based his Greek types,
    there are plentiful examples of more formal Bzyantine manuscripts hands with broad
    and upright letters. The cursive letter construction is still the norm, i.e. pen
    lifts are minimised, and many letters are still joined in ligatures, but the overall
    impression on the page is much more formal and quite different from the Aldine
    style.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pemptousia.com/2011/11/the-library-of-vatopaidi-and-its-manuscripts/\">This

    the phrase 'end-users of Greek fonts' may be misleading or, at least, is very
    vague, because there are very different end-user groups. It should also be noted,
    of course, that there are different kinds of users within Greece, also with quite
    different needs (just as there is no uniform body of 'end users of Latin fonts').
    People who only work with monotonic texts don't have the same needs as publishers
    working with polytonic text. Packaging designers don't have the same needs as
    editorial designers. So I think my question to Tatiana about how she is defining
    the end-users of Greek fonts for the purpose of her project as a valid one. Related
    to this question of who the users are, of course, is how she is planning to get
    her questionnaire to these users, and how she will correlate results. Nativeness
    in itself isn't a terribly interesting qualification -- and I'm not talking now
    just about Greek, but about any script --; what is much more interesting and important
    is knowing what sort of work a person is doing and what sorts of fonts that work
    involves. In order for information flowing from users to be useful, it is necessary
    to have some idea of who they are and, hence, the context of the comments. These
    days, of course, anyone who uses is a computer is an 'end-user of fonts', but
    I presume Tatiana won't be handing our her questionnaire on street corners. I
    presume she has some plan to garner responses from, say, graphic designers, maybe
    publishers, probably students and maybe their teachers, since they're often easiest
    to involve in such things. How broad will the response base be? How representative?
    What user groups are likely to be under-represented or perhaps not represented
    at all?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I recommend to you Konstantine Staikos' _Charta of

    monotonic and polytonic text you work with?\r\n\r\n2. Whether you work with polytonic
    text personally or not, how important do you consider it for a Greek text type
    to include polytonic support?\r\n\r\n3. Greek italic types tend to be less differentiated
    from their upright styles than is the case with Latin fonts; sometimes slant is
    the only distinguishing characteristic. Do you find this sufficient, or do you
    wish for more differentiation, e.g. variant forms of some letters or different
    stroke patterns?\r\n\r\n4. Apart from upright and italic styles, what other features
    do you most want to have in a Greek font family? Additional weights (which?),
    true smallcaps, true superior letters (uppercase? lowercase?), or something else?
    If you want it all, how would you rank these things in importance?\r\n\r\n5. Some
    types evoke particular associations, e.g. 'classic' or 'modern', 'reserved' or
    'friendly', etc.. These associations are subjective and seldom precise, but they
    are conventionally recognised. When you think about available Greek types, what
    associations do you wish were better represented? For example, do you wish there
    were more 'fun' Greek types, or perhaps more 'elegant' ones?\r\n_____\r\n\r\n<em>Also,

  body: "<em>what does 'slant' mean in typography, esp. in a Greek font?</em>\r\n\r\nOblique
    angle off the vertical. So italic letters generally slant (lean) to the right.\r\n\r\nIn
    Latin script, the upright (roman) lowercase letters follow a formal construction
    model, i.e. if you were to write them with a pen, you would often lift the pen
    and put it back down on the page while writing many of the individual letters,
    but the italic letters follow a cursive construction model in which the pen stays
    in contact with the page much more, reversing direction to create new strokes
    rather than being lifted. As discussed earlier in this thread, the Greek lowercase
    letters have a cursive internal construction, which means that this distinction
    doesn't naturally exist between upright and italic styles for most Greek types.
    So often the only distinction between upright and italic is the slant to the right.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    know about smallcaps, but not of true smallcaps and true superior letters. Any
    font which would have all this, so I could see them for myself?</em>\r\n\r\n'True
    smallcaps' is a term often used to refer to designed smallcap glyphs in a font,
    these days typically accessed via OpenType Layout features, as distinct from fake
    smallcaps that have been mechanically produced by software (by scaling down and/or
    distorting regular caps). The same thing applies to superior letters (and numerals):
    these can either be designed glyphs in the font or are faked by software. In Latin
    fonts, it is now quite common to have a full set of lowercase superior letter
    glyphs in addition to a full set of superior (and inferior) numerals. When I've
    made fonts for scholars such as the SBL Greek or the new Brill types, I've been
    asked to include full upper- and lowercase Greek superior letter sets, because
    these are fairly frequently used in the apparatus (textual footnotes) of critical
    editions. This is what they look like in the Brill roman font:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
    I am wondering is whether users in Greece have a need for superior letters.\r\n\r\n<em>Do
    you have a inclination for serif? Or is a demand factor? </em>\r\n\r\nI make custom
    fonts according to briefs from a client, so it just happens that most of my clients
    for Greek type design have wanted serif text faces. I designed another sans serif
    Greek, a corporate type for Heidelberg Druckmaschinen produced by Linotype (the
    Latin art directed by Erik Spiekermann and based on News Gothic):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HDGothicGreek_4767.png]\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to accent position, in almost all types I position them to the left of
    the uppercase letters (excepting the dialytika of course), because for better
    or worse that is now the accepted standard and I think most Greek readers would
    think it strange to see them anywhere else. But recently I made a typeface for
    the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, which is one of the world's
    most important holdings of Byzantine seals and coins. That font represents the
    wide variety of uncial forms that Greek letters took during the Byzantine Empire,
    so that scholars can transcribe the appearance of text on particular coins and
    seals. One of the things we determined when planning that project was that in
    the Byzantine uncial the accents were always written above the letters, not to
    the right or left. One sees this also in ikons and mosaics.\r\n\r\nHere are some
    samples of that Greek (and Latin) typeface for seal and coin scholars. I suppose
    it too might be thought of as a kind of sans serif.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AthenaRubyShowing_6700.png]"

    it existed in handwritten texts long before Gutenberg, who made considerable efforts
    to copy the handwritten texts of his day.\r\n\r\nAt first, the bicameral system
    consisted of tacking Roman capitals on to the uncial script, and it likely did
    involve occasional capitals for a little while at the start. But by the tenth
    century, the system was well established:\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule]]\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I see that your examples of Greek manuscripts suggest a small x-height. In Latin
    typefaces, though, x-height is quite variable, depending on the design goals of
    the script. Thus, oldstyle faces like Caslon or Cloister Lightface illustrate
    the traditional ideal x-height, while Times Roman or Corona have much larger x-heights
    to maximize legibility.\r\n\r\nArmenian has a traditional \"Bolorgir\" form with
    a considerably smaller x-height than the Latin alphabet. The Armenian lowercase
    letterforms are suited to a small x-height, because they exclude two-storey letter
    forms; thus, lowercase S lies flat on its back. Greek lowercase, on the other
    hand, has a similar variety of letter shapes as Latin lowercase, so its natural
    x-height could not be much smaller.\r\n\r\n(If you feel I am being noncommittal
    on this issue, you are correct. In my opinion, whether the x-height of Greek lowercase
    should naturally be lower than that of the Latin alphabet is a question that can
    really only be answered by generations of native speakers of Greek as type designers,
    as typographers who choose type designs, and as readers. Anyone who wants can
    study old inscriptions and design a \"Greek\" typeface, but a self-conscious effort
    to incorporate Greekness into a type design runs the risk of failing badly. Yet,
    without conscious attempts, there will be nothing to choose from but Latinized
    models. The only resolution I see is careful study of both traditional and folk
    sources - and patience.)"

    Greek letters have a 'hidden system of implemented ligatures', and the design
    itself is based on this construction. </em>\r\n\r\nNo, what I was talking about
    is independent of ligation. To be clear: ligation involves visual connection between
    different letters. In Greek this is optional -- unlike e.g. Arabic, Syriac or
    Mongolian --, but was characteristic of the Byzantine book hand and hence of early
    typography. What I was talking about with regard to italics, is the internal construction
    of lowercase letters, not their connection to each other. [See also my comments
    earlier about the use of the term 'cursive', which can apply to either joining
    of letters or to internal construction.] To understand this, consider the two
    common forms of the Latin lowercase a: the roman a can only be written with the
    pen being lifted from the page at least once and repositioned, i.e. first the
    top and right stem are written, then the pen is lifted and repositioned to write
    the bowl (a calligrapher may in fact lift the pen twice, using two separate strokes
    to write the bowl, especially if working at larger size); the italic <em>a</em>
    can be written without lifting the pen from the page, i.e. starting in the top
    right, the bowl is written as a loop and then the pen reverses direction to form
    the stem. The roman a has a formal or interrupted construction; the italic <em>a</em>
    has a cursive construction. The Greek lowercase letters as inherited from their
    Byzantine origins mostly have a cursive construction; only a few letters -- \u03BB
    \u03C0 \u03C4 \u03C8 -- require that the pen be lifted during writing (\u03B8

    will help designers aiming at some level of authenticity in a Greek typeface,
    so I'm happy to learn this.\r\n\r\nMy take on this hasn't been explicitly stated
    yet in this thread, although it's probably clear by now. Due to an enforced interruption
    in Greek script and printing tradition, Greeks have felt compelled to borrow from
    the ready-made models in the Latin script community - and Greek typefaces designed
    by non-native speakers - to have typefaces with which to print books and newspapers
    and the like to meet practical needs.\r\n\r\nI don't condemn or deplore this;
    it may be regrettable, but it's a natural reaction to circumstance.\r\n\r\nTo
    emerge from this, to create typefaces that better meet the cultural and aesthetic
    criteria of Greek readers, is a good thing. But while a study of historical models
    is <em>useful</em> in the attempt to do this, one should probably also study <em>folk</em>
    models, (i.e. a street vendor's handwritten sign with the price of oranges) because
    success in this quest will likely take a long time to achieve, as different attempts
    at a more Greek style of printing succeed or fail in the community. (It isn't
    due to some racist or mythical belief in the value of blood ancestry that I think
    that this must largely be carried out by native Greeks; it's that people who read
    and write Greek, and live in Greece, that will have been exposed to innumerable
    instances of Greek handwriting and sign-painting and typeface choice, thus having
    the base of information on which to form judgments on what would \"look Greek\"
    to other Greeks!)\r\n\r\nAfter all, in this respect, Greek typographers face a
    doubly difficult task. It is not simply that they need to make up for the lost
    time when the Greek community was without the resources to design its own types,
    and produce a developed indigenous Greek typeface tradition. They must also take
    the foreign invention of a bicameral writing system and fully assimilate it so

    good enough) is that the entry/exit stroke of Greek lowercase letters (even in

    it 'hidden system'.  And if we exclude them, the Greekness is gone ... I presume.

    the needs of end-users, that's great. If you aim to satisfy the end-users, more
    or less, but not interested in their opinion, maybe, I say maybe, there is a gap
    of information between the designer and the user. \r\nOn the other hand, I presume
    the word <em>design</em> implies the creation of something new. And maybe is good

    books, and I think the entry and exit strokes result from a number of different
    factors in the evolution of Greek minuscule. I think the particular shapes of
    the cursive Byzantine style are related to the ligation that occurs between some
    letters, as you suggest, such that the writing pattern of the connected and unconnected
    forms are similar, but I see the introduction of some entry and exit strokes earlier,
    in the late, square uncial style (8th C.). It is interesting to note in that style
    that the \u03BC has no descender, and the left stroke instead begins with a baseline
    entry stroke; there is a consistent right-side baseline exit stroke, too, which
    connects to following letters but is present even when there is no connection.
    This is around the time that the nib rotation begins, leading to styles with heavier
    horizontal strokes. Interestingly, the example I am looking at is from a Paschal
    letter of the Patriarch of Alexandria probably from the beginning of the 8th Century,
    and the bilingual text puts the date definitely between the Arabic conquest of
    641\u20136 and the decree in 749 that only Arabic should be used in Egypt. Now
    this is especially interesting to me, because I noted some years ago that the
    steep pen angle of the Byzantine cursive is very similar to that of Arabic, Hebrew
    and other Middle Eastern scripts, reminding us that the Byzantium was the capital
    of a mostly Eastern empire."

    stable since the introduction of typography, and reflect the standard book hands
    of that time. I don't think that is a controversial statement, and the fact that
    within the confines of those models there is lots of variety of design doesn't
    alter the observation. The <em>structure</em> of a Jenson lowercase roman a is
    the same as that of the latest sans serif roman. The point with regard to Greek
    is that there is an open question about what constitutes the letter shape and
    what constitutes an optional feature. To one degree or another, this question
    is open for all scripts, and it is one of the things that enables the development
    of new styles. Not all experiments are successful.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that
    a line be drawn in the sand or that you or anyone else should follow a particular
    path. I do think that, historically, the reduction of a script to typography tends
    to slow the rate of evolution and favours establishment of standard models. Witness
    how the typographic roman remained the standard text face of print publishing
    even when all around it scribal culture continued to innovate and produce new
    text styles right up until the introduction of the typewriter. That's an observation,
    not a prescription. As I wrote above with regard to my Helvetica World Greek,
    some people chose to see it relative to Matthew Carter's Helvetica Greek as some
    kind of ideological statement. I just tried to design something that seemed to
    me to capture what I found interesting about Helvetica while achieving a texture

    - with the only change being ones that don't complicate immediate recognition.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why Gothic stayed around for so long - and why, when Roman pushed it out, it
    stayed pushed out, since the Roman letterform is objectively far more legible
    - different letters are more clearly distinguishable.\r\n\r\nBecause this is the

    type designer, whether he's a native speaker of Greek or not, can attempt to invent
    a typeface with the glyphs of the Greek alphabet in the style that the Greeks
    might now be using had history happened differently.\r\n\r\nNo physical laws are
    violated by so doing. But because history still happened as it did, the result
    in the present might not turn out to be useful to present-day Greeks, particularly
    if it's too strange or unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nIt's precisely because there were difficulties
    in Greek history that the Greeks have borrowed from the well-developed Latin typographical
    tradition to have a wide selection of typographical materials sufficient to the
    needs of an industrial society. If they can respond to a shortage of Greek typefaces
    in this manner, then they can also respond to typefaces based on foreign models
    not suiting their aesthetic sensibilities by designing new ones that, in whatever
    way, are more \"Greek\".\r\n\r\nThe quest for materials with which to work involves
    looking to the past, to folk models, and within oneself. Although I'm used to
    Porson Greek as the way Greek is represented, I know I find it jarring, but I
    don't know how a native speaker of Greek finds it. But if it is found deficient,
    alternatives exist, and more can be prepared.\r\n\r\nThe past can be the reason
    why we need to work harder on contributing in certain ways to the present. And,
    on the other hand, as it's affected what Greeks are used to, it will have changed
    the present in ways we do have to accept. So instead of the Greeks going to the
    typefaces they would have if all of this never happened, I see much smaller changes,
    aimed at resolving the degree to which existing typefaces, although people have
    gotten used to them, are still not entirely a good fit to their aesthetic sensibilities.
    These changes, I suspect, will tend to be somewhat in the direction of more historical
    authenticity, but not exclusively in that direction - but they won't go very far,
    and outside influences will remain very visible."

    applies in that case. What happens in the 19th Century in Greece is the importation
    of French (Didot) and German (Lypsias, i.e. from Leipzig) types which become the
    norms for Greek upright and italic style text types. In the 20th Century, Monotype
    90, which is based on the Didot upright, becomes the standard publishing type.
    But while these designs originate outside of Greece, they are not Latinised in
    the sense that applies to the Linotype Greeks of the 1970s. They do not import
    into the script shapes structures from Latin type design; rather, they reinterpret
    the construction of letters inherited from the Byzantine minuscule using a contemporary
    split nib stroke model and the strong dynamics of Romantic types. Yes, they are
    designed to harmonise with what is happening in Latin type design at the same

    or modernization or globalization, but about the text color of specific typeface
    designs.</em>\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll admit that the comment about the junta was a provocation
    -- and it is interesting to note that the Latinisation trend continued past the
    end of the dictarorship and into the 1980s --, but I don't think the trend can
    be reduced to typographic design criteria independent of cultural and political
    factors of the time.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned a few times already in this thread,
    the texture on the page -- what you call text colour -- is central to my design
    approach. And one of the reasons why my Helvetica World Greek is so different
    from the 1971 Greek is that I found the latter did not, in fact, have the texture
    of Helvetica on the page. Part of the reason for this I have only just realised,
    which is that although it was packaged as 'Helvetica Greek' it was paired with
    Helvetica Neue, not the original Helvetica design. For this reason it was more
    loosely spaced and most of the round forms were wider.\r\n\r\nIn this <strong>revised</strong>
    comparison image I have tracked the Helvetica Latin (middle) and Helvetica World
    Greek (bottom) to approximate the looser spacing of Helvetica Neue. This does
    make for a better harmonisation of texture between the 1971 Greek (top) and the
    Helvetica Latin, but I still think the former is too geometric and rigid.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HGR2_6116.png]"

    that Antonios Sigalas discusses?<\r\n\r\nI was looking for days in my books, and
    it seems that Greek bicameral system was introduced after Gutenberg, and not by
    every publisher/punch cutter. Sigalas doesn't discuss about it and I could deduct
    this information only from images. Also, I noticed that for codexes, up till year
    1645, there is no bicameral system, only occasionally uses of upper letters, as
    you mentioned. So, is a 'typographic' innovation. \r\n\r\nDo you know if the same
    happened to Latin? Or the bicameral system was introduced already in hand written
    texts before Gutenberg?\r\n\r\nI was reflecting about one of the characteristics
    of Greek letters, and I found some interesting images for Typophile's collection
    (as the images appear, 215 AD, 8th century AD, 1060 AD, 1079 AD, 1305 AD)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5240.png]\r\n\r\nfor
    image 221 (the last): the first words are \"<em>\u03AC]\u03B3\u03C9\u03BD\u03B9\u03C3\u03CE\u03BC\u03B5\u03B8\u03B1\u0384\u03C7\u03B1\u03BB\u03B5\u03C0\u03CC\u03BD

    and \u03C7\u03B1\u03BB\u03B5\u03C0\u03CC\u03BD resembles a lot to \"\u03BC\".
    And there are more examples of this kind. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES A GREEK
    LETTER LOOK GREEK:\r\n\r\n\r\n- ascenders and descenders (which are more in number
    in Greek alphabet than in Latin). If you cut them as much as possible, the result
    will be latinization of font\r\n\r\n- another way to emphasize the Greekness is
    the unequal sizes of letters (the image below), but then you are loosing the harmonization\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture_4177.jpg]\r\n\r\n-
    serif and semi serif is another Greek element. Even in designing a sans serif
    Greek font, as Helvetica World or Whitney, it can not be a 'clean' sans serif
    (latin VS greek in Whitney font):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-1_6476.jpg]\r\nBut
    exception are the capitals, as in John's project for Dumbarton Oaks Research Library
    and Collection. \r\nThis is the reason why lowercase Latin and Greek are considered
    two different categories of letters, especially in a cross script font?\r\n\r\nJohn,
    as I understood from your explanations about 'slant' factor, the Greek letters
    have  a 'hidden system of implemented ligatures', and the design itself is based
    on this construction. Thus, the slant is the only distinction between upright
    and italic Greek letters. \r\n- so we have another element: ligatures\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n-
    different x-height. But I couldn't find out if Greek's should be smaller than
    Latin's. Or is the designer who decides the proportions between them two?\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nAlong the current economic crisis in Greece, there is a tendency of finding
    and establishing the Greek identity again, to impose the Greekness on a global

    is a tendency (in the field of graphic design, at least) for more <em>clean and

      overstated the impact of the release of one typeface.  There are many, many,
      thousands of fonts in our current market.  I imagine it more this way: If while
      sailing on a ship, and a tear were to fall from my eyes and land in the waves,
      it would become part of the great ocean of salty water and have no more possibility
      of setting a trend or style than any other drop in the ocean of fonts available.
      If I were Adobe, Microsoft, or Apple, I would have a much, much greater chance
      oven being discovered.  In their case, their fonts come freely available with
      no effort or cost to anyone on earth who has access to a computer.  Think of
      Papyrus. It gets  used and overused and misused every day by people who want
      something \"different\" than the every-day but who are not aware of or care
      to search for or even pay for a more appropriate font.\r\nAny independent type
      designer has no where near the reach to \"create a trend\" just by producing
      the type. If a very large corporation were to choose that same face for a globally
      marketed product, there would be much more of a chance of affecting the whole
      market of graphic designers who may wish to be seen as trendy in their type
      choices.  The market itself creates the trends.  The type designers only make
      possible choices, a drop in the ocean of choices."

      create a particular atmosphere.  In this case, you can evoke that feel of handmade
      old Greek village store products even though it is modern plastic wrap packaging.
      The ligated forms echo that but the ranges of use for that face would not extend
      too far beyond that type of market.  What typeface would a Greek producer of
      electronic products use for his packaging? What about a Greek Pharmaceutical
      company?  Would they want a homeopathic image or a medical science image?  There
      is no one style fits all solution for Greeks any more than there is for any
      other nation on earth. Look at the Latin script countries of Europe, they use
      a great variety of types to suit their communication needs.  Denoting, primarily,
      the nostalgic relevance of the country of origin is not typically first on their

    than Hrant is.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that the initial models of typefaces for use
    by Greeks were flawed for the purpose of everyday use by native speakers, because
    that wasn't what they were developed for. Since Latin alphabet typefaces were
    very well developed for that purpose, though, I would expect that the natural

    <em>be</em> Latinization - for practical reasons, they would seek to make the
    typefaces available for the Greek language suitable to all purposes <em>in a hurry</em>,
    and what better way to do that than to adapt and borrow what already exists instead
    of making the extra effort required for originating?\r\n\r\nThe result of that
    phase is an improvement on the original, but still not ideally satisfactory. Having
    an authentically and organically Greek typeface isn't just a matter of feeding
    chauvinism; it really does have practical consequences for further improving readability

    It is closer to symmetrical than the examples I showed, yes, but follows the same
    basic principles of asymmetry: the left side connects to the diagonal closer to
    the corner, the right side departs from the diagonal closer to the middle, and
    the lower right termination is more heavy and dominant than the upper left. The
    Didot original on which it is modelled is even more asymmetric, with the lower

    never got to thank you for the 'An Essay on Typography' of Eric Gill. Thank you!\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Dear
    Gentlemen</em>,\r\n\r\nWriting the thesis on Latinization of Greek typography
    I faced a pragmatic question: why is so harmful this phenomena? \r\nFrom the available
    bibliography, I could deduce that \r\n<dd>1) every writing system is a cultural
    heritage and the identity of every nation\r\n2) Latinization may demote cultural
    authenticity of a non - latin script and\r\n3) reduce functionality</dd>\r\n\r\nI
    cannot find a strong argument against Latinization. \r\nPLEASE HELP!\r\n\r\nI
    presume almost everyone would agree on three mentioned points, although the third,
    about functionality it is not quite clear to me. If it implies readability, at
    least for Greek text, I still do not see an extended problem. Recently I saw a
    short passage in a journal, where among other latinized greek letters '\u03B7'
    was actually a latin 'n', no descending part. I read the text easily and observed
    the substitution only because I am aware of it. But there was nothing tragic in
    the situation.\r\n\r\nEven if Latin alphabet will assimilate completely the Greek
    one, there always will exist a 'community' - editors of classical Greek and ecclesiastical
    texts which will use fonts related to Byzantine scripts.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussions
    of this thread, although with an imprecise way, I understood that it is possible
    to preserve the characteristics of Greek letters and to give them a more modern
    form. But, it seems to me that Greek typography is 'trapped' into Byzantine/Renaissance/Baroque
    periods. While Latin letters give a designer more room for changes towards progress,
    Greek typography is far away from that. Do you think is possible to preserve Greek
    characteristics and to design a font which would resemble to the clarity and geometry
    of Latin one?\r\n\r\nGreek nation is a contradictory one. It is steadily with
    one leg into their past and with other travelling through the entire world. But
    the same could be said about Arab countries. It is wrong or right, I don't know.
    But it seems to me that this is one side of human evolution - to tend to something
    new, something different. \r\n\r\nDo you think only type designers are concerned
    with the issue of Latinization, while Greek society is not interested at all?"

    can't speak to this from knowledge, but on general principles I would expect that
    readers do notice any eccentricity in a typeface, whether it's in the direction
    of more faithfulness to Byzantine models than is usual or more extensive Latinization
    than usual. And that anything that impairs functionality is not appreciated.\r\n\r\nBut
    stylistic Latinization - as opposed to anything that takes liberties with actual
    letter forms - might well be accepted, at least within limits, warmly - because
    it makes it easier to have the diversity, the choices, of typefaces that the Latin
    alphabet has.\r\n\r\nI feel that the Byzantine model is inadequate to the typographic
    needs of the Greek people, and that something that is indigenous to Greece and
    yet as versatile as the Latin script needs to develop. Latinization is a placeholder
    until that happens, but it's destructive because it will change what people find
    natural, leading to future developments being diluted. The alternative, though,
    is fundamentally unacceptable - people won't do without an effective capability
    to express themselves in type if one is available."

  body: "Charles, a lot of arguments in favour of cultural diversity ultimately reduce
    to a kind of biological metaphor. We've got excellent reasons to believe that
    biodiversity is essential for the long-term survival prospects of life on earth,
    and we presume that cultural diversity might be similarly beneficial for humanity.
    Personally, I think such arguments are unnecessary, because there are perfectly
    good short-term reasons to favour cultural diversity over monoculture in terms
    of richness and variety of experience (which is not the same thing as cultural
    relativism; being able to say that e.g. circumcision is a form of cultural violence
    against the individual is important within this diversity) and respect for both
    particular and shared heritage as something to be celebrated rather than lamented.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, in terms of writing systems, and hence typography, a process like Latinisation
    seems simply perverse to me. Why does this conversation even take place, why is
    this a phenomenon? We're not debating Chinesification of Danish typography, or
    Hindification of Malaysian typography, or Cyrillification of Ethiopian typography,
    because these are all plainly ludicrous. Dressing up one writing system in another's
    clothes <em>is</em> ludicrous, and one doesn't need to make arguments from cultural
    diversity to say it is a pathetic idea. As a kind of <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=201\">novelty
    display typography</a>, it has a long history, but would you as an English reader
    sit down with a book set in <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/chinese-takeaway2.font\">Chinese
    Takeaway</a>? And yet we consider it normal, or at least something about which
    reasonable debate is possible, that Greek -- or Thai, or Hindi, or Russian --
    readers should read Latinised versions of their writing systems? And that this
    constitutes 'progress', as if the Latin writing system were in some way inherently
    superior, and not simply the beneficiary of political, financial and industrial
    contingency?\r\n\r\nLet me also clarify that while I think it unfortunate in terms
    of loss of richness and variety, I don't blame any society that decides to give
    up its indigenous writing system in order to adopt one that it thinks will be
    more materially beneficial. I think the traditional Javanese script is one of
    the structurally cleverest and most beautiful in the world, but adoption of a
    Latin orthography in the mid-20th Century clearly helped integrate Java within
    Indonesia and contributed to increased literacy in the socio-political context
    of that time. But actually adopting a new script is an entirely different matter
    than playing dress-up with your old script, of trying to make it look like something
    else. That's just sad and pathetic.\r\n\r\nNow, does this mean limiting the range
    of expression of your writing system and typography to specific historical models?
    No, I don't think it does, and I think it is an entirely false association to
    equate the development of new styles with Latinisation just because Latin type
    designers have produced such a variety of stylistic innovations over the past
    couple of centuries. And, indeed, in what way does aping stylistic idioms of Latin
    typography constitute innovation in another script? If the only way you can stylistically
    innovate is to try to come up with a Greek -- or Thai, or Hindi, or Cyrillic --
    version of Helvetica, then maybe you're writing system is culturally dead on the
    ground already. "

    few years ago, western multi-national corporations were producing experimental

    fortunately that's prevented by the fact that for <em>some</em> of the letters
    in the alphabet, there's no obvious Roman-style lowercase shape. A typeface that
    you have to learn how to read has little chance of catching on. So Porson got
    improved, leading to Apla, and little further movement towards a more Latin-like
    lowercase for serif fonts has taken hold.\r\n\r\nThe other way is to go away from

    is a loaded question.  I do not feel that a particular ductus should be a requirement
    to look  Greek overall. Ductus to me can only be addressed if we are looking for
    some subcategory of Greek that details the writing tool or technique or time period.
    I should be able to crudely scratch Greek in the dirt with a pointed stick and
    still have it be Greek.\r\nIn other words, if it looks like a duck, walks like
    a duck, and talks like a duck, it is a duck.\r\n\r\nTo quote my friend Nick Shinn,
    what makes it look Greek is the \"Curly Bits\". \r\nThat is an oversimplification
    but still of value. My mother detested reading what might be called sans serif
    Greek type (even though there really are no serifs in Greek). She may be referring
    to the entrance and exit strokes John Hudson referred to or to Nick's curly bits
    (She died several years ago at 90 so I can't ask.). Greeks of today have differing
    opinions but are quite accustomed to what we choose to call sans serif.\r\nArabic
    and other scripts also have \"curly bits\" but they do not look Greek. Greek is
    a phonetic system like Latin and follows the same rules of reading order (at least
    beyond the earliest form).  This may give it a Latin-like grey value on a page
    from a distance but close up, what distinguishes it from Latin to me is the variety
    of stroke type. Latin ascenders are quite regular, a straight vertical bar is
    dominant.  Greek has more variety and none of it as simple as a straight line.
    Descenders in Latin are much more regular and simple as well.  The double-boweled
    g is the only odd-man out.  Latin x-height is clearly defined.  Greek is much
    more of a tendency than an exact point.  I see Greek more like a form which extends
    both ways beyond a centerline than Latin, which is pretty much a railroad track.\r\n\r\nGreek
    glyphs borrow less from each-other than Latin (which is much more modular).  What
    I might find a better description is to say that while Latin \"marches\" [lock-step
    to the beat of the drum across the page in rigid 4:4 time], Greek \"dances\" [in
    complex time signatures to a lilting mix of interplay of instruments].\r\n\r\nSo
    then if it looks like a dance, sounds like a dance, and moves like a dance, it
    must be Greek. Opah!"

    couple of different uses when talking about writing and type. Some of my calligrapher
    friends are very particular that the word should only be used to refer to the
    order and direction (and sometimes speed) of strokes by which a letter is written,
    which is the traditional meaning and provides the etymological base for the word.
    I've come to the conclusion that they're right, despite having previously used
    it in the other sense, favoured recently by type designers, to refer to pen angle

  body: "<em>...what do you think about the \"Greekness\" of Greek lowercase letters?</em>\r\n\r\nIsn't
    that what we were talking about for most of this thread? I don't think I've got
    much to add other than what I wrote earlier:\r\n\r\nI judge Greekness in terms
    of texture on the page, rather than specific letter features or treatments, but
    obviously that texture is built up from those features. In other words, I find
    it much easier to critique Greekness as a quality when looking at a page of text,
    seeing how the letters work together, than in terms of looking at individual letter
    shapes.\r\n\r\nAs someone who works with a lot of different writing systems, I
    am sensitive to the fact that most scripts evolve normative letter constructions
    based on particular writing tools and practices, and that typography sits in relation
    to these letters (it can sit in critical relationship, or in rebellious relationship,
    but it can't ignore them). In the case of Greek lowercase letters, this means
    sitting in relationship to Byzantine scribal tools and practices, since that is
    where these letters came from. This means dealing with a predominantly cursive
    internal construction.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean 'Greekness' must involve only reproducing
    Byzantine forms, or even particular Byzantine cursive script as interpreted by
    the Aldine press? No. It should also be noted that the Byzantine scribal tradition
    was not stylistically uniform. The historically most fruitful innovations in Greek
    typeface design, it seems to me, have engaged with that tradition, looking for
    ways to reinterpret the normative letter constructions with new tools (Didot),
    or looking for different directions emerging from that tradition (Scholderer's
    New Hellenic)."

    to see the results of your study published. Unfortunately I found this thread
    too late to add any questions for the questionnaire, so I decided just to tell
    you about making greek script in my Flauto typefamily, maybe it could be of any
    help. It is a venetian antiqua with faces for different optical sizes and weights
    and now I have greek in light regular styles (I plan to make greek for bolds and
    italics too). When I finished first variant of my greek it looked rather latinized
    so it was hard to distinguish latin and greek in mixed texts. I didn't like it
    and I decided to make it more traditional so that it could be easily seen (even
    without reading) as greek (not latin or cyrillic). For the second variant of my
    greek I've chosen \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC style, because it seems to be closer
    to venetian antiqua then other traditional greek styles. While making this variant
    I noticed that greek lowercase seem smaller and lighter then latin and cyrillic
    ones so I decided to make some compensations: I increased the height of greek
    lowercase and made them a little darker trying to balance the color and height
    of all scripts. Here is an example of my greek, latin and cyrillic scripts in
    a light regular style for the 21-35 pt: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Flauto_sample1_3857.jpg]"

    \ (which help to improve letter spacing) and several uppercase ligatures. In italic
    cyrillic ligatures look more natural, so I've already made some and will continue.
    Today ligatures are still rather rarely seen in cyrillic books in text setting,

    The question that interests me is about the using of polythonic small caps inside
    Greece today. I read John Hudson wrote: \u201CSmallcaps have been used at times
    to emulate square uncial letters in the transcription of ancient manuscripts\u201D.
    I've made them in my font, but still wonder If there's a need and does anybody
    uses it in contemporary editions in Greece.  \r\nAnswering your question about
    x-height: my latin and cyrillic scripts have the same x-height, but greek lowercase
    I've made a little higher, I mean if you compare for example latin \u201Co\u201D
    and cyrillic \u201C\u043E\u201D with greek \u201C\u043E\u201D (omicron), the omicron
    will be mathematically higher then latin and cyrillic \u201Co\u201D in order to
    seem the same optically. I was adjusting the height of greek lowercase till it
    seemed to me equal to latin and cyrillic in text. And the similiar is about weight:
    for example if you compare again omicron with latin and cyrillic \u201Co\u201D,
    the omicron will be darker. I've increased the stroke weight till it seemed to
    me that greek evened in color with cyrillic and latin in text setting.         \r\nAnd
    also Yannis Haralambous wrote in his article \u201CFrom Unicode to Typography,
    a Case Study: the Greek Script\u201D (a very useful and interesting article that
    helped me a lot): \u201CAn intrinsic characteristic of the \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC
    family is that the ratio of lowercase height to appercase height is smaller than
    the one of typical Latin typefaces. This makes harmonization between \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC
    and Latin typefaces harder.\u201D I've been doing greek in just \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC-style
    and I can say for my case the compensation of height was needed, but I don't think
    that it works for all styles or fonts (and there are fonts that don't seem to
    belong to any particular traditional style), it should be checked by eye every
    time. However it seems to me the more \u201Ccurly\u201D or \u201Ccursive\u201D
    (don't know how to formulate the term exactly) the style is, the more it needs
    to be compensated, but I'm not sure.\r\nAnd answering your question about my three
    scripts, while making I tried to harmonise them so that they clearly seemed to
    belong to one typefamily, but at the same time to keep the tradition of each script
    and distinguish in mixed texts. \r\nAndreas, what a tasty lettering:)"

    in my post to avoid the potential of it being misleading. While I believe that
    modern Greek is not typeset in the polytonic form any more, it is still very important
    and useful for a Greek font to have polytonic capability (even if extending it
    to new frontiers like small capitals is dubious) - because most modern Greeks
    <em>are</em> able to read Classical Greek without having it translated for them,
    and <em>that</em> is properly typeset with the polytonic accents.\r\n\r\nImagine
    an English-language font that couldn't be used to print Shakespeare! (But I'm
    not arguing to have eth and thorn added to every Latin font, nice though that
    would be. Chaucer, most English speakers do need a translation to read.)\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I think I may have become misleading in the other direction.\r\n\r\nNative speakers
    of Russian do not need an acute accent indicating the stressed syllable in every
    word. Native speakers of Hebrew do not even need the vowel points! So native speakers
    of Greek may indeed have little trouble reading, say, Aristophanes without the
    use of the polytonic script apparatus.\r\n\r\nBut a typeface not available in
    polytonic fonts could not be used for a dictionary of Classical Greek, it couldn't
    be used for accurate quotations of texts printed in polytonic form, and for so
    many scholarly purposes, that I think it would be comparable to a Latin font developed
    by an English speaker that had no accented characters, and so couldn't be used
    to quote from French or Italian or Spanish - it would be usable only for the simplest
    purposes."

    Obviously this is applied indirectly to the description of type. I think Tatiana's
    second image is correctly labelled -- except that the last line should be 'italic

    although the terminology is pretty common.\r\n\r\nI consider the pronounced bend
    in e.g. the left downstroke of the Didot style eta to be derived from writing
    speed. So structurally I still think of it as a horizontal entry stroke, a turn,
    and a vertical main stroke. When written quickly, over time this evolves into
    a curved stoke in some styles, but that doesn't seem to me to negate the usefulness
    of the entry stroke as an analytical concept. Indeed, this concept allows us to
    understand the shared structure of styles with curved stems and styles with straight
    stems that share the initial horizontal trajectory.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Tatiana,
    it might be helpful if you were to use an example of low contrast eta with a more
    obvious entry stroke to illustrate the concept."

    italic is something imported into Greek from Latin typography, and b) the cursive
    construction of Greek minuscule makes it more difficult to strongly differentiate
    upright and italic styles. I'm not at all convinced that the solution to this
    is to make the upright less cursive, though, since the result tends to look very
    stiff and awkward not only in contrast to traditional styles <em>but also when
    compared to Latin romans.</em> I believe this is because the Latin script maintained
    a formal bookhand tradition based on interrupted letter construction for much
    longer than Greek, so evolved letter shapes that were pleasing in both upright,
    formal and slanted, cursive styles that were in widespread use in the script at
    the time of reduction to type. There are upright, formal styles of Greek writing,
    but they are archaic.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with your approach, Nick, is that
    it seems to suggest that the way to resolve a design problem arising from what
    you acknowledge is an importation from Latin is to import more stuff from Latin.
    Where does that end? To how many of the world's writing systems does it apply?\r\n\r\nLatin-script
    typographers, authors, editors and publishers did something really brilliant when
    they gradually systematised the use of roman and italic to articulate text, i.e.
    systematised the use of two different existing writing styles -- upright and formal,
    slanted and cursive -- in a contrastive way. The usefulness of the system is obvious,
    and one can see the attraction to adapting it for other writing systems. But not
    all writing systems have existing parallels, so one ends up with artificial creations
    to fit criteria of contrast established by the Latin model instead of contrast
    naturally occurring within the script. It's as if Latin typographers without access
    to a roman and italic manuscript style distinction had observed the constrastive
    use of, say, Arabic naskh and ruqah styles in Ottoman manuscripts, and tried to
    come up Latin letters that exhibited the characteristics of those Arabic styles
    in order to create a system of textual articulation."

    terminals, as to suit them to the rest of the font. Then I faced reservations

    not sure what demanding implies in this context. It seems to me objectively more
    difficult to differentiate two things that have more in common with each other
    than two things that have less in common with each other.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is
    there any kind of research about script-inherent duality modes similar (but not
    equal) to \u2018Latin Reg./It.\u2019 ?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't know about
    research, per se, in the sense of systematic investigation, but I have observed
    that most mature scribal systems evolve both formal and informal modes, and these
    may produce differentiated styles that would adapt to a roman/italic-like system.
    And very often the differences between the formal and informal styles parallel
    those between roman and italic: interrupted vs cursive construction, upright vs
    slanted, broad vs compressed. But even when such differentiated styles exist within
    a script they do not always end up being used in the way that roman and italic
    are used in Latin script typography. For instance, the Hebrew square letter is
    a formal bookhand directly equivalent to the Latin roman, but the Hebrew cursive,
    which persists as a daily handwriting style, never evolved into either a secondary
    manuscript hand or a differentiated typographic companion style. Which is a pity,
    because it has a lot of potential in that r\xF4le.\r\n\r\nIt massively helped
    the development of Latin typography that roman and italic letters were already
    being used side-by-side in manuscript. The typographic innovation was not to pair
    these styles, but to systematise the pairing that already existed, e.g. using
    italics for titles, for foreign words, for emphasis. The fact that the system
    employs  italic for several different purposes, rather than multiplying styles,
    itself tells us something about the inherent conservatism that in other scripts
    hampers the development of contrast-based text articulation.\r\n\r\nThere are
    a number of scripts in the world in which the formal scribal bookhands involve
    cursive construction and features, with or without cursive connectivity and/or
    graphotactic shape modification. Perso-Arabic is the most obvious example of a
    mature scribal culture completely abandoning non-cursive writing, but all the
    evidence is that this is also true of the Byzantine scribal culture: formal, interrupted
    Greek uncial letters continued in use in ikon writing, mosaics etc., but text
    manufacture moved to a cursive style around AD 400, stayed there for well over
    a thousand years, and was still there when type came along."

    confused by a tendency in English to call certain kinds of entry and exit strokes
    in Latin script, especially italics, 'serifs', but I find the distinction useful.
    Nick has made the reasonable objection that the entry and exit strokes can be
    interpreted as part of the stem, not as a separate stroke. So perhaps instead
    of talking about entry and exit strokes we should talk about 'stroke entries'
    and 'stroke exits', i.e. as something that happens at the beginning or end of
    a stroke other than a hard start or hard stop.

    What I have objected to in the culture of Latinisation, particularly as it played

    'westernisation', 'modernisation' etc., as if these things were only approachable

    when I started introducing traditional letter construction into Greek companions

    in the 1970s and '80s and which was prevalent in Greek typography. Of course,

  body: "The serif came out of Latin inscription and lettering (see Catich  http://www.amazon.com/The-Origin-Serif-Writing-Letters/dp/0962974013
    )\r\nGreek lowercase writing came from the writing hand and the tools of the scribes
    of the time.  When writing with pen or brush, our first mark point is the entry
    stroke. As getting the pen started was not always totally predictable, a scribe
    might begin his first stroke with what began as a test stroke to get ink flowing.
    \ This later became visible as a tiny blob or stroke upon entering the glyph.
    Seeing these strokes as normal, later scribes continued and emulated what had
    come before them.  People of my age (who have begun their writing learning with
    a pen dipped in ink) will find this natural and expected.  At your young age,
    I doubt if you have experienced this unless you have studied calligraphy. The
    exit stroke is the final mark at the lift of the pen and often tails towards the
    next glyph to be written.  This too is quite normal.  The serif, on the other
    hand, was a more purposive shape that was done in addition.  True, uppercase Greek
    often contains serifs due to influence of the Romans who were the rulers of the
    era.  When the Ottomans invaded Greece and many other territories around the Byzantine
    time period, the amount of control and influence that the Romans had diminished.
    \ The Romans were busy with their own fall.  In the years that followed, the european
    countries not under the Ottomans proceeded to develop the Latin lowerecase of
    several styles and then the great era of printing began to flourish.  During this
    time, Greece was somewhat isolated from this experience.  The Greek lowercase
    grew out of the Byzantine writing and was later influenced buy the Turks.  Not
    so much as the Turks forced any form on the Greeks as just that the Turks prevented
    much interaction between the Greeks and other Europeans. Four hundred years went
    by with limited European influence and the Greek script continued to be on its
    own.  The Entrance and exit strokes became more prominent with faster writing
    and soon took their place as the expected construction of each glyphs that we
    have today. After 1821, the Greeks began their reunification with the rest of
    Europe.  At this point, printing was quite sophisticated but the Greeks were 400
    years behind and caught up with the great help of their brother european countries.
    \ This help also brought Latin script back as an influence."

    that, at least, would be my description of the construction (ductus) of Greek
    minuscules. Part of the confusion of this topic, I think, comes from the binary
    categorisation of Latin types as either 'serif' or 'sans serif', which fails to
    provide for other kinds of stem termination (flares, tapers, entries, exits) and
    ignores other characteristics that would suggest different categorisation (for
    example, I consider a low contrast slab serif to have more in common with a low
    contrast sans serif than with traditional serif text types). I don't think this
    binary categorisation serves Latin typography very well -- certainly not as well
    as its universality would suggest --, but then it gets applied to all other writing
    systems to try to label what are, in fact, entirely different kinds of letter
    construction, more often, in fact, distinguished by stroke modulation (so one
    sees low contrast Arabic types being non-sensically described as 'sans serif').\r\n\r\nI
    think it makes most sense to limit the use of the term serif to a particular kind
    of formal stem termination. This typically involves an interrupted construction
    of some kind, i.e. the lifting and repositioning of the pen or brush, or a reversal
    whose intention is to create this visual detail rather than to carry forward the
    shaping of the letter. From this it follows, contra much common usage, that many
    'serif' italic types do not in fact have serifs in the lowercase; they have stroke
    entries and exits instead:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notserif_6233.png]\r\n\r\nNow,
    this leads to an interesting question. In the example below, following my argument,
    it is clear that 'A' is a stroke exit, not a serif. But what is 'B'?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ABee_3821.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    we say it is a serif, on what basis? I think it has to come down to the sharpness
    of the transition to the stem, the fact that there is a definite corner there,
    and this is what marks the difference between the serif (formal, interrupted construction
    (in this case with a pause and direction change rather than a lift) and the stroke
    entry (cursive, flowing into the stem)."

    they <em>may.</em> And that constitutes a particular style or category of sans
    serif design. There are also, of course, sans serif styles and categories that
    do follow humanist or other traditional letter construction. And these have been
    particularly popular in the past couple of decades, roughly contemporary with
    the new tendency in Greek type design to favour a parallel approach. With regard
    to the 'corporate Western-designed Greek sans faces' to which you refer, these
    have tended to be produced alongside or as companions to Latin designs that are
    also not geometric or minimalist. In fact, geometric sans serifs constitute a
    minority category vs the much larger 'humanist' and 'grotesk' categories: they're
    not very common in Latin typography, and even if they were it doesn't follow that
    a particular stylistic approach that works in the context of one script is applicable
    to all scripts. It happens that a design like Futura works for the Latin minuscule
    (although I consider the classically proportioned caps by far the most successful
    part of the design), but although the same principles can be applied to other
    scripts, the results may simply be awkward and disjointed.\r\n\r\nPart of our
    disagreement may result from a different analytical approach. You cite the 'the
    single storey \"g\"' as an obvious example of the way in which Latin sans serif
    types 'may be geometric and minimalist'. I see it simply as the adoption of a
    variant letter construction from a different historical style. To me, the parallel
    is this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forminform_3807.png]\r\n\r\ni.e.
    a shape derived from the formal style and a shape derived from the cursive style.
    The fact that, in the Greek, it is the formal shape that is more geometric and
    minimalist, and the cursive more visually complex, illustrates where I think your
    analysis relies too much on superficialities."

    get a bit nervous about setting up rules.  I would feel better if we would just
    say that if it walks like a duck.  I mean, let whomsoever design type as they
    see fit without a firm set of rules. Then let the users determine if it suits

    mean that we would be free to try whatever before we assume it is not a good choice."

    something about which it is good and right to have opinions and to engage in argument.
    There is sometimes a tendency to suggest that users -- or 'the market' -- will
    decide, as if the community of users were not made up of culturally aligned groupings,
    asserting influence or struggling in their ways with opinion and argument (not
    to mention subject to advertising and a host of other pressures). I think this

    rejecting a fixed set of rules, a 'correct' way to design Greek types, does not
    mean that the arguments about approaches and results are pointless."

    was, and this is an important point: there is a distinction between a kind of
    absolute innovation -- truly novel shapes, of a kind that occur only rarely in
    typography -- and what is innovative for a particular time. Scholderer, it should
    be remembered, was not a professional type designer: he was an incunabulist (scholar
    of early European printing) and bibliographer. His New Hellenic type design was
    a deliberate attempt to revive a neglected branch of early Greek 15th Century
    typography: based on the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/FormGrekBkHnd.jpg\">rounder,
    more upright Byzantine hand</a>, and without ligatures. [Robert Proctor's <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/GR10.jpg\">Otter
    Greek</a> had been an earlier, less successful effort in the same direction.]\r\n\r\nSo
    while, in the context of Greek type <em>at that time</em> (1920s), Scholderer's
    design is clearly innovative, it is also an historical revival, undertaken by
    a man whose professional life was entirely focused on the distant past, not on
    contemporary graphic design or typography. This is why I find the contrast of
    innovative and conservative artificial and unhelpful. While not in the same class
    as New Hellenic, I would argue that my Helvetica World Greek was innovative, at
    its time, in the context of fashions in Greek type design; indeed, it caused something
    of a scandal by breaking the accepted mould of numerous other Greek 'Helveticas',
    precisely by introducing those features of letters that Nick now describes as
    conservative.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nThere is a 2006 discussion regarding Scholderer's
    New Hellenic (with some discussion of Latinisation, which I hope I refuted) here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/19265\r\nIn
    that thread I posted images of a number of incunabula types on which Scholderer
    drew for his revival. Seven years on, I don't even remember writing all that stuff,
    but am pleased to see that I don't disagree with it now.\r\n\r\nPS. That 2006

    type design?\r\n\r\n1. Notwithstanding the variety of letterforms in the Latin
    script tradition, the binary categorisation of serif and sans serif is predicated
    on the identification of certain design features as optional and superfluous to
    the essential letter shape. This enables us to produce skeletal representations
    of those essential shapes, which while not necessarily interesting or particularly
    useful as designs serve as a kind of diagram of the letter.\r\n\r\nCan this be
    done for Greek? And what would the results look like? What parts of the letters
    are to be considered optional and superfluous, and which are to be considered
    essential.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that, when this is attempted, there will remain
    considerably more variation in the notion of essential letter shape than there

    is that the internal cursive construction of the Greek minuscule makes it challenging

    design problem, and seems to me something that we might usefully focus on, with

    It is in the context of this approach that the underlying challenge/problem presents

    one option, although not favoured by some users. What about systematic variation

    is that in Greek, italic is the default\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century,
    Greek type had upright roman capitals matched with an italic (slanted, cursive)
    lower case. That\u2019s all. It was an archa\xEFc pairing, identical to that of
    the \uFB01rst Latin italics of Manutio.\r\n\r\nMonotype\u2019s Greek 90 & 91 implemented
    a pseudo-Latin two-style typeface by splitting the old Greek upper and lower cases,
    combining a backslanted version of the lower case with the capitals to become
    the \u201CRoman\u201D (Greek 90), and combining an <em>ITALICIZED</em>  version
    of the capitals to the lower case to become the \u201CItalic\u201D (Greek 91).
    This design was so well liked it became known as the \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC,
    or plain style.\r\n\r\nSo no, there is no big difference between upright and italic
    Greek, if one takes the \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC to be the default or norm. However,
    I contend that the \u1F01\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC, despite its many virtues at the time
    and since, was a half-assed compromise, an expedient compromise that shirked the
    responsibility of designing an upright style that was truly functional, in terms
    of being one half of a Roman-Italic system, by merely straightening up the italic.\r\n\r\nIlya,
    certainly there is a mirrored symmetry to the use of Roman and Italic as the contrast
    face for each other, but the point I am making is that Roman, with a vertical
    axis, is better suited to the rectangular quality of typographic layout.\r\n\r\nTatiana,
    that is why I consider the \uFB01rst approach (cursive as default, upright as
    emphasis) wrong.\r\n"

  body: "Hi there,\r\nI apologize if I break the flow of discussion, but I promised
    Tatiana to make a comment.\r\n\r\nFrom my part I disagree with the term 'Latinization',
    it sounds so colonial. I tend to agree more with the term 'harmonization' or formalization'.\r\n\r\nGreek
    letters can be as much upright or italic as Latin. \r\n\r\nIf Latin was formalized
    over the years into an upright typographic model, why can't this be done with
    Greek. After all, they are related scripts. Let's not forget that Latin has Greek
    origins, so please view this an an inevitable 'progress' which was meant to begin
    happening. \r\n\r\nSome may argue about the inherited nature of the Greek letters
    as an obstacle to this end. I disagree. You just have to be aware of the challenges
    facing Greek type design before you start feeling confident you are doing the
    right thing. In that respect greek letters can also be as serif as latin provided
    you know how to properly design the letter shapes so that they do not seem strange
    sitting next to each other. By making the right design corrections, you can make
    Greek text look less or more stiff depending on how stiff Latin is. I totally
    agree with Nick Shinn's comment <cite>\"\u2026I try to strike a balance between
    maintaining the conventional Greek letter forms, and respecting the thematic characteristics
    of the typeface\"</cite>.\r\nIf 2 scripts are to belong in the same family they
    have to share common characteristics, otherwise you might as well call them by
    different names and place them in different families. Eric Gill's reasoning was
    right when he attempted to design <strong>Perpetua Greek</strong> with common
    characteristics to its Latin counterpart, but unfortunately it was badly executed.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the Greek typefaces which became predominant until late 20th century was designed
    by Didot. This typeface was reminiscent of Latin italics. It appeared from time
    to time with different names and slight variations. In the 60s one of its variations
    became <strong>Times Greek</strong>. In the late 80s the market became more demanding.
    Designers started challenging old designs, they wanted to try fresh ideas, there
    was a need to mix languages. All of a sudden the existing Times Greek was not
    satisfactory. This typeface's Latin and Greek looked like they belonged to a different
    family. It completely undermined the term font family. (see blue vs red).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek1_3926.png]\r\n\r\nEver
    since, the major concern for some of us, who for reasons of proximity, understand
    and live the language, has been to match the visual appearance of Greek with other
    scripts by respecting the tradition and the values it represents, without losing
    their own distinct characteristics.\r\nFor instance, <strong>Centro Serif</strong>
    [[http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/centro-serif-pro]] retains its upright
    form in Greek whilst it incorporates its cursive form in the italic version.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek3_5184.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek2_5729.png]\r\nSame
    with <strong>Regal Text</strong> [[http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/regal-text-pro]]
    which is harmonized across scripts such as Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. Here is
    a rather interesting pdf on the whole <strong>Regal series</strong> design details
    and inspiration [[http://www.parachute.gr/sites/default/files/8000_RegalPro.pdf]]
    \r\n\r\nMy argument is this: If part of our world is 'harmonized' as this translates
    for instance into buildings of similar shape and form across different countries,
    or similar/same products we use around the world, doesn't this has an impact on
    typography? Doesn't this arise a need for 'harmonized' letterforms across latin,
    arabic, greek, or other scripts?\r\n\r\nIf the trend is towards square-like letterforms,
    why would anyone expect the shape of greek letters go the opposite direction i.e.
    having a mostly round shape with slightly handwritten nature?\r\n\r\nThis subject
    cannot be addressed strictly academically. You have to 'live' the language, you
    have to know how native Greeks use it and what they expect to see. You have to
    know what the market wants. Ad agencies, branding agencies, design studios, magazines,
    newspapers, TV stations, road signs. How and what Greek types they really use
    or expect to use.\r\n\r\nFour main issues are of concern when designing Greek
    letters:\r\n<strong>1.</strong>  In total, Greek lowercase characters have more
    round parts than Latin ones, as well as there being a much higher frequency of
    round characters within a sentence. In this respect the greatest challenge is
    to design the Greek characters in a way that the difference in appearance is not
    disturbing. It\u2019s a trade-off between the round and square parts of the characters\r\n<strong>2.</strong>
    Large number of letters with descenders. There is a total of 10 Greek letters
    with descenders compared with a total of 5 for Latin. This automatically makes
    Latin easier to read.\r\n<strong>3.</strong> Challenging Greek characters. Letters
    such as \u03B6, \u03C2, \u03BB, \u03BE, \u03B7, \u03C7, \u03B4 can be designed
    in a few different ways which in turn can make your design, look modern, traditional,
    friendly, etc. Some shapes may also be used as alternate forms to emphasize the
    content.\r\n<strong>4.</strong> The shape of \u03B1 (alpha) is also very important
    as its frequent appearance may affect the greek text's tone of grey as compared
    to latin text.\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "Panos, thanks for jumping in. While I can understand that you would want
    to avoid the term Latinisation because it sounds colonialist, I wonder if this
    simply masks colonialism if harmonisation means, as your comments and illustrations
    indicate, <em>harmonisation of Greek to Latin</em>? There doesn't seem any evidence
    of the opposite, or of a kind of balanced polyphony: Latin typography is taken
    as the norm, and other scripts are adapted to it.\r\n\r\nHarmony is a complex
    phenomenon, and very different from singing in unison (una voce). I think we probably
    agree to a large extent on the desirability of harmony, but differ in our appreciation
    of how harmony is achieved. All type design is about making things that are inherently
    and necessarily different in some ways the same, so that they work well together.
    My own approach to such harmonisation is quite flexible: I don't think there is
    a generally 'correct' way to do it, only a way that is correct in a particular
    context. In that regard, we deal with different sets of contexts, and you as a
    Greek designer in Greece probably have more freedom to introduce Latinised features
    than I do. If you get accused of Latinisation, you can make the case for it within
    the context of your market, as you have done here; if I get accused of Latinisation,
    that's colonialism. :)\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nThe Latin uppercase letters have their
    origin in the Greek alphabet, but the lowercase of the two scripts evolved independently
    of each other. So I don't think it is helpful to cite an historical relationship
    of the two scripts to suggest that what happens in one is inevitable in the other.
    Nor is it accurate to say that  'Latin was formalized over the years into an upright
    typographic model': that model was there at the beginning, in the formal humanist
    manuscript hand. It didn't need to be formalised over the years: it was just adopted
    from one medium into another, alongside of the informal, cursive secretary hand
    that is the Latin italic. So to apply these categories to other scripts is to
    apply a specific accident of 15th Century Italian text culture. Now, if one were
    seeking to make a distinction between upright, formal style and slanted, informal
    style in Greek type, one could look at the distinction that existed in the 15th
    Century, between the Complutensian and Aldine styles, and therein find a more
    obvious parallel and 'inevitable progress'. Except, it clearly wasn't inevitable,
    because unlike the Latin parallel these two kinds of Greek were not adopted as
    contrasting typographic articulators. This strikes me as unfortunate, both because
    it means that, until the 19th Century, Greek typography was limited in its ability
    to articulate texts, and because it means that an organic evolution of contrasting
    styles <em>independent of Latinisation</em> didn't happened.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the illustrations of the Centro regular and italic, which I think are
    very interesting. What strikes me most -- and this is true when I look at Nick's
    designs too -- is that the Latin and Greek italics are much more harmonious than
    the Latin and Greek uprights. The italics have a very similar textural impact,
    which the uprights don't manage so well, despite sharing a lot of details and
    common shapes.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\n<em>2. Large number of letters with descenders.
    There is a total of 10 Greek letters with descenders compared with a total of

    So you are saying that fewer descenders and more uniformity in height makes a
    script automatically easier to read? So a script with no descenders at all would
    be easier to read than one with, say, five? Do you have any evidence to support
    this assertion?"

    I wasn't talking about approaches or methods, but commenting on the results in
    particular designs. I'm saying that where stylistic harmony between the two scripts
    is the design goal, as in Centro, this seems to be consistently achieved more
    in the italics than in the uprights. Looking at Panos' illustrations, I am reasonably
    sure that side-by-side pages of Centro Latin and Greek italic text will have a
    more similar texture and colour than side-by-side upright text.\r\n\r\nNor am
    I saying that this is necessarily a result of the method of formalising the upright
    Greek construction along the lines of the Latin. It seems to me that closer harmony
    could probably be achieved by varying the proportions and spacing of the upright
    designs to optically compensate for the greater frequency of round counters in
    the Greek. [Related to this observation: I think many Greek types with broad proportioned
    letters are too tightly spaced, such that a good balance of internal and interletter
    white space is not achieved.]\r\n\r\nPanos made the comment that he thinks Gill's

    of Greek to Latin, while it may be useful for certain purposes, isn't a good thing
    where we're talking about daily use of Greek typography without Greek and Latin
    texts being present on the same page.\r\n\r\nBut harmonization of Greek uppercase
    and Greek lowercase to each other is something that I <em>think</em> might be
    beneficial to native users of the Greek language - and having a distinct upright
    and italic form of the script, again, might also be beneficial - and these things
    <em>seem</em> to require Latinization; at least, making Greek look like Latin
    seems to be the simplest and most obvious way of achieving those goals.\r\n\r\n<em>This

    the design space in directions that Greek typography did not use due to historical

    the variety of sans-serif typefaces, such as New Hellenic, though, I think that

    Schweizerischer Buchdrucker\u2019 in 1969. On some of the pages titled \u2018Majuskelkursiv\u2019,
    \ I found the \u2018R\xF6mische Urkundenkursiv\u2019*, namely on page 28, image
    32 and on page 39, image 63. The sheets with this script show handwriting with
    a cursive-like construction as well as ascender- and descender-like forms. They
    are dated \u20181st century B.C. or 1st century A.C.\u2019 So if no paleographer
    has come up with more accurate dating of these scripts, they could as well have
    been written before the Capitalis Rustica. And (therefore) also before the Capitalis
    Monumentalis reached its formal summit (with both serifs and stroke contrast)
    on the Trajan column and similar pieces of lettering. If this is true, the development

    that a Greek script cannot have a roman counterpart, i.e. letterforms with an
    interrupted construction. Or a geometric pattern for the lowercase. Or a thick-to-thin
    contrast related to the broad nib. We have to take in consideration that the readers
    of the Latin script survived Futura and Bodoni as well as many other minor and
    major deviations of \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 the Venetian Old Style. I am
    not telling that these developments should (therefore) be copied to the Greek
    script, but all of this is likely to happen (if it not already did). At some point
    these developments will turn out to be successful, beautiful, acceptable and maybe
    even readable. After all, it took almost 60 years from the first Futura-like geometric
    sign painters alphabets to Paul Renner\u2019s Futura. Also it took over 60 years
    before Frutiger took up Johnston\u2019s idea of the humanist sans serif and freed
    it from its ideosyncrasies in such a way that the principle is now seen as the
    basis for designing an extremely legible sans serif. And when we look at recent
    developments, we see that this development will continue and that better results
    can be achieved. Didot made a crazy, and unusual because dogmatic \u2018g\u2019,
    it was as experimental as Paul Renner\u2019s trials for Futura, but Bodoni got

    eliminating descenders but rather minimizing to the same level as latin, if that

    (eta) is not necessary to have a descending part, it may just stand above the

    from the capitals through the uncial. </em>\r\n\r\nAlbert, \r\nsince Latin alphabet
    evolved from Greek, maybe this information on evolution of Greek script may help
    you. \r\n\r\n1*. In ancient Greece, 3 styles of writing could be distinguished
    (from around 4th BC and continued up till 15th century) :\r\ndimotiki (everyday
    use), calligraphic (for literary books) and official writing (official state documents
    and later for royal purposes). All these styles had a parallel evolution, means
    that all of them existed simultaneously and were influencing each other.\r\nFor
    dimotiki, the most common writing surfaces were wax tablets and pieces of clay.
    For calligraphic - papyrus and later parchment replaced it, same for official
    documents. The used writing tools (stylus for clay and wax, reed and ink for papyrus)
    allowed the writing to 'flow' on this surfaces. \r\n\r\nMy point here is that
    especially the papyrus, which was used at least form 3rd BC, gave quite a round
    form to letters, different from those of inscriptions. Through images of Sigala's
    book one can see that during first centuries BC the writing cannot be described
    as uppercase, but neither as lowercase (see im. 126-p. 202/ im.127 - 203). And
    the lowercase 'was there' much earlier than we think. It was like an idea growing
    up. \r\nDefinitely the first written letters were uppercase for both alphabets,
    which can be seen form inscriptions, but for other 3 styles of writing, the 'clean'
    uppercase wasn't the dominant style for many centuries.  \r\nBeside this, at some
    point (5th AD), Greek writing resembled very much to Latin, and one could not
    distinguish them (see p. 217, im. 145 - horizontal one). \r\n\r\nAnd I am not
    sure that the Latin people were the one who used for the first time serifs. Around
    3rd BC Greeks began to introduce some decorative elements in inscriptions, but
    borrowed from calligraphically written books, as to say written on papyrus (p.192)\r\n\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Zbq6h_hZ0qU/UAlZO5_-EGI/AAAAAAAAV3w/qkIDIqQo_zQ/s1600/\u0395\u03C0\u03B9\u03B3\u03C1\u03B1\u03C6\u03AE+\u03A0\u03B1\u03C1\u03AC\u03BC\u03BF\u03BD\u03BF\u03C5.jpg\r\n(you
    have to copy/paste the link)\r\n\r\n2.** \"In the mid-2nd century BC and probably
    under the influence of insular writings or <strong>writings on papyrus</strong>,
    [...] serifs are used for the first time, for letters of Attic inscriptions\".\r\n\r\nNote
    that for 'insular writings' is not specified which islands Tracy is referring
    to, maybe with Greek population, maybe with Latin. \r\nSo, from this point of
    view, Latin not only has Greek origins (referring to the adoption of alphabet)
    but also the later evolution of its writing system wasn't so different from Greek.

    I think:\r\n\r\nPanos: <em>When we read we concentrate mostly on the upper part
    of the letters.</em>\r\n\r\nThis is often repeated, but seems to be a misinterpretation
    of the observation that <em>in the Latin script</em> it is easier to recognise
    words when their lower half is obscured than when their upper half is obscured.
    But we don't actually read in those conditions, and if we examine the results
    of <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/11/1161.short\">bubble testing</a>
    to see what parts of different letters we rely on most to recognise them during
    reading, we see that we make use of the full area of letters, with descenders
    being important to the recognition of letters that include descenders. There are
    many writing systems that have more descenders than either Latin or Greek, and
    most of the scripts of southern India and Southeast Asia make much more use of
    space below the baseline than they do ascender space. At typical text sizes, the
    full height of utilised space is easily within the vertical arc of foveal focus
    -- indeed, one of the things that makes reading easy is that individual lines
    of text are within this arc, while those above and below are parafoveal --, so
    I don't see any reason to presume that descenders are a 'distraction'; indeed,
    they provide for identifiable features in a distinctive area of the overall grid,
    reducing the potential for mis-identification (consider, in contrast, the relatively
    few descenders in Cyrillic text and the corresponding monotony of x-height letters)."

  body: "Man, I'm gonna need a week-long vacation just to catch up with all this amazing
    discussion... But until such a minor miracle happens let me at least properly
    address the vertical proportions issue.\r\n\r\nI think we can agree that different
    writing systems use the Cartesian Space differently, both in terms of frequency
    and richness (compare Latin and Arabic for a very pronounced case). If we also
    agree that -for example- in Latin extender size isn't purely of stylistic relevance,
    that it plays a positive role in reading (at least during immersive reading)*
    then it becomes clear that making different writing systems adhere to a fixed
    vertical-proportions scheme is damaging to functionality. <strong>{Added:}</strong>Basically,
    letterform features are the \"data\" used to read text, and the way the data is
    <em>distributed</em> -relative to the writing system- cannot be ignored without
    probable bad consequences.\r\n\r\n* Which is why call-caps is harder to read,
    and furthermore why larger point size settings benefit from a smaller x-height
    versus smaller point size settings.\r\n\r\nFor example in Armenian the \"x-height\"
    region is much more monotonous than in Latin, while the extenders* are much richer
    than in Latin. If you make a Latin+Armenian family with consistent vertical proportions
    you will make one script or the other (possibly even both) less readable. And
    for what gain? Do readers really use a loupe and exclaim: \"Hey, some stuff isn't
    lining up!\" The case of Greek is no different. When you look at the visualization**
    I posted you immediately notice that in Greek:\r\n- The descender space is more
    heavily used than in Latin.\r\n- The \"x-height\" region has many more rounds
    than straights.\r\n- Ascenders are actually rarer.\r\nTo me this <em>inevitably</em>
    leads to the conclusion that an <em>optimal</em> Greek \"x-height\" is larger
    than in Latin***, and at the expense of the ascenders. And as an aside, it's harder
    to make Greek narrow.\r\n\r\n* BTW the belief that we read the tops of letters
    I find illusory; there is no way I can buy that Greek having more/richer descenders
    is a bad thing (for reading).\r\n\r\n** To answer John: such visualizations I
    find supremely helpful in knowing which direction(s) to go in breaking the vertical-proportions
    \"despotism\", even providing a rough numeric ballpark. For example when I made
    Nour&Patria I saved myself mountains of guesswork at arriving at a harmonious
    whole. In comparison, looking at only the alphabets (even with duplication to
    reflect frequency) and some sample settings doesn't provide nearly as much insight,
    as efficiently. I believe data visualization is a key to good design.\r\n\r\n***
    BTW I was very pleased to see that Yulia has done this! It's like a scientist
    postulating the existence of a new particle and much later actually seeing it
    show up.  :-)\r\n\r\nThis is the crux of it; I'll try to fill in some gaps later.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSomething
    else: I can think of two cases of <em>Hellenization</em>, Carter's Skia (born
    from his much earlier Cadmus)* and a font by Michail Semoglou (for which I don't
    have a sample -or even a name- handy). Looking for previous discussions where
    I mentioned those two designs I found this thread\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/18390\r\nwhich
    I think can be helpful.\r\n\r\n* http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/cadmuskia.gif\r\nJohn
    H. has opined that the Greek isn't very authentic; irrespective of that, to me
    Skia remains a Hellenized design.\r\n\r\nTo me cultural importation -like anything
    else in life- is about Intent: people make non-Latin (and really even Latin) fonts
    a certain way because of what they want for their own life and/versus what they
    want for society. We each strike a very personal balance. But when choosing what
    fonts to use/promote it's important to take into account how much of a given designer's
    intent is helpful to the designer (closer to pure Art) versus other people (closer
    to pure Design).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    limit myself to one tiny point.\r\n\r\n<cite>For instance, \u03B7 (eta) is not
    necessary to have a descending part, it may just stand above the baseline (see
    Centro Serif Regular compared to Centro Serif Italic in my previous post). This
    is quite acceptable. Greeks write \u03B7 both with or without descender. You may
    justify a similar approach with some other letters as well.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn general,
    I'm of the opinion that up to a point extenders help in reading by aiding in differentiating
    those relatively fewer letters that have them. A weakness of conventional Cyrillic
    lowercase in my mind is the paucity of extenders. I'll never get used to the Bulgarian-style
    yu (\u044E) with an ascender (are you kidding me?) but I wouldn't mind it if people
    started actually writing yo (\u0451) instead of replacing it all the time with
    ye (\u0435) in Russian, or even if the more prominent old-timey tails of tse (\u0446)
    and shcha (\u0449) came back into fashion.\r\n \r\nSo I was surprised to see the
    comment that fewer descenders make reading easier. This got me thinking about
    the exact role of extenders in helping readability. They of course break up the
    monotony of letters confined to the x-height; imagine if everything looked like
    \"as no one concerns us even more\". But extenders don't have to be too frequent
    to achieve this role, and past a certain frequency it's likely to become too much.\r\n\r\nMy
    subjective opinion is that Greek in its current monotonic orthography has somewhere
    near the right balance of things happening outside the x-height. I don't think
    Greek has too many descenders, since many of the letters with descenders like
    \u03C8, \u03BE, \u03B6, and \u03C6 don't occur too frequently.  \r\n\r\nBut here's
    the thing. I remember posting something about this many years ago, but I'm perfectly
    happy with \u03B7 (eta) without a descender. It isn't just about being exposed
    to so many examples of descender-less \u03B7 in handwriting and in print, or even
    that the older handwritten and printed forms of descending \u03B7 tend to have
    much shorter descenders than are usual today.\r\n\r\nIf all the other vowels (\u03B1,
    \u03B5, \u03B9, \u03BF, \u03C5, and \u03C9) are extender-less, it appeals to my
    symmetry-seeking nature to have a descender-less \u03B7 as well. Perhaps it's
    my grounding in the Korean alphabet where all vowels are variations on a set of
    simple elements that makes me expect some sort of a unity in design that holds
    the vowel letters together. After all, there's something about the Roman letter
    y used as a vowel that is not entirely satisfactory for me\u2014it doesn't look
    enough like a vowel letter due to its descender. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm
    the only one who feels this way, though.\r\n\r\nI do decidedly prefer descending
    \u03C7, by the way. Confined to x-height, it would be distractingly close to \u03BA."

    such formalisms. Now, if <em>only</em> the vowels in Greek were confined to the
    \"x-height\" I would say that sure, the \u03B7 (eta) should follow that rule,
    because there the confinement would be conveying usable information*. But I <em>love</em>
    the \"y\"! It would be so nice if Latin used its rich descenders more frequently;
    the ascenders are more frequent but overall way too plain (only the \"f\" is pulling

    the low readability of all-caps) conveys information. Saying that Latin is easier

    to locate (Eco? Pinker?) for many years: the premise was that even if one replaces
    each letter in an English sentence by its bounding rectangle, the resulting image
    is still kinda readable (as in \u25AF\u25FD\u25AF \u25AF\u25FD\u25FD \u25FD\u25FD\u25FD\u25FD
    \u25AF\u25AF\u25FD\u25FD \u2014 only with proper distinction of ascender /descender
    parts).  The theory is/was that the eye when it follows the sentence can recognize
    such \u201Ccoarse\u201D shape quite early (when finishing the disambiguation of
    preceding words, so the following words are still on the low-resolution part of
    retina), and then this preliminary info may be used when these words come \u201Cinto
    focus\u201D.\r\n\r\nBut then I discovered a text (blog?) of the head (?) of Microsoft
    type design team.  The premise was that when he came to M$, the team was under
    the influence of the theory I hinted to above; since at the moment he knew that
    the theory is not very much trustworthy (in view of recent improvement of experimental
    data), he spent some time to collect information on experiments which more or
    less debunked the theory above.  IIRC, the machine in the experiments would track
    Rapid Eye Motion, and would blur all the letter further than some distance away
    from the center of vision (in real time!).  IIRC, the speed/reliability of reading
    in these experiments would not suffer even if the \u201Cdistance\u201D is 3\u20134
    letters.  (Sorry, do not have an exact reference right now.)\r\n\r\nSo the theory
    that \u201Cmacro-shape\u201D of words may be helpful for reading might be not
    that much substantiated by experiments\u2026"

    one, worth thinking of :) Do you have the book of French Laurent Pflughaupt, 'Letter
    by letter'? Is quite a good systemized book on evolution of letters. He explains
    that \"in the crossover to Greek [from Phoenicians, the HETA] was integrated as
    the HETA consonant, transcibing the [h] sound. It also became the vowel ETA, with
    a softer pronunciation corresponding to a [long e] in Ionion Greek. This vowel/consonant
    ambivalence is still evident in French nineteenth-century dictionaries...\" (p.75

    BTW, in letter frequency scale, the '\u03B7' belongs to 14th place. I am not sure
    if its descender has a negative impact on reading. In any case, to support the
    theory of descenders making reading more difficult, one should engage in a series
    of experiments. If any of you has the idea who would be willing to help us, I
    am in! \r\nGreek population should be asked to read long texts with all ascenders
    and descenders included, than to switch to a font with less descenders and ascenders.
    And maybe several switches should occur. But on which criteria one should choose
    the proper font for both cases? They can not differ in style...\r\nBesides, the
    fatigue factor should be included, then the emotion condition. Is a scientific

    which we pronounce with sound \u201Cyo\u201D (for example \u201C\u0451\u043B\u043A\u0430\u201D,
    \u201C\u0451\u0436\u0438\u043A\u201D) often (but not always) are written with

    You can see it in books, magazines, internet and other media. Though in official
    documents this situation causes problems: when people with \u201C\u0451\u201D
    in their surname have it written with \u201C\u0451\u201D in some documents (for
    example passport) and with \u201C\u0435\u201D in other (for example some agreements),

  body: "Another point I didn't mention is that \u03B7 can carry an accent as in \u03AE,
    so it is going to be using the extender spaces in some cases regardless of whether
    it has a descender.\r\n\r\nHrant, I don't think the ascender space is too underused
    in Greek. It's way better than Cyrillic at any rate, and it's nice that polysyllabic
    words will always have a tonos to make use of that space. I do think Latin could
    use its descender space a bit more, but even that I don't find too problematic.
    Maybe I'm easy to please, but unless extenders are too few and far in between
    (as in Cyrillic) for me the gains in usefulness start diminishing with increased
    frequency. I think it is an overreaction to see fiddling with the descender of
    a single Greek letter as an instance of jingoism. There is of course the danger
    that non-descending \u03B7 will be designed as if it were the Latin lowercase
    n due to their superficial similarity, and that would be an instance of true Latinization\u2014but
    I think we would all agree that this is clearly something to be avoided.\r\n\r\nI'm
    pretty sure by now that it is a personal idiosyncrasy of mine to be bothered by
    vowel letters not confined to the x-height. Maybe it's just my subconscience making
    up reasons after the fact. I think it must surely be entirely coincidental that
    in the development of lowercase letters, the vowel letters a, e, o, u, \u03B1,
    \u03B5, \u03B9, \u03BF, \u03C5, and \u03C9 became confined to the x-height, just
    as it must be coincidental that the even numerals 6 and 8 ascend beyond the x-height
    while odd numerals 3, 5, 7, and 9 descend in old-style figures (and yes, I wouldn't
    mind seeing 2 and 4 ascend just to preserve that symmetry :) ).\r\n\r\nTatiana,
    I don't have Pflughaupt's book but I'll try to check it out. That's an interesting
    note about the vowel/consonant ambivalence of \u03B7. And of course, the Latin
    h comes ultimately from the western versions of the Greek alphabet that did keep
    the consonant heta. Incidentally, there is also vowel/consonant ambivalence with
    the Latin y, since it is often used for a consonantal sound as in 'yes' though
    in some languages like Finnish it is used exclusively for vowel sounds except
    in borrowed words.\r\n\r\nDesigning readability experiments is always difficult
    due to the impossibility of controlling variables. For example, Centro was posted
    as an example of a design with non-descending \u03B7. The problem I have with
    that design is that \u03B7 now feels too close to \u03C0 due to the serif in the
    left foot of the latter. The effect is subtle, but that introduces the tiniest
    bit of hesitation in reading and recognizing the letters. Not a problem in display
    typography, but for immersive reading I imagine there is an effect. One reason
    I have no problem with non-descending \u03B7 is that there wouldn't be a danger
    of it being confused with another letter, but designing \u03B7 and \u03C0 to be
    identical in the lower half does bring that risk. Here I think the fault is more
    in the design of \u03C0 rather than \u03B7\u2014I can't quite get on board with
    the serif on \u03C0.\r\n\r\nHrant: <cite>* Speaking of Hangul, one amazing thing
    about it is that its four levels of syllable \"visual density\" are strongly associated
    with a syllable's grammatical function.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you're
    referring to. It is true that CVCC or VCC syllables (with orthographic consonant
    cluster at the end; C standing for consonant letters and V standing for vowel
    letters) are most often found in nouns (e.g. \uD759 <em>h\u016Dlg</em> 'soil'),
    verb roots (e.g. \uC77D\uB2E4 <em>ilg-da</em> 'to read'), or adjective roots (\uBD89\uB2E4
    <em>bulg-da</em> 'to be red'). But they can also be formed by root+suffix as in
    \uC54C- <em>al-</em> root of 'to know' + -\u3141 <em>-m</em> nominalizing suffix
    = \uC54E <em>alm</em> 'knowing'. Other than that, CV, CVC, V, and VC syllables
    occur in all parts of speech, so they are not distinctive in conveying grammatical
    function. We can't really say anything beyond that the visual density of hangul
    conveys the underlying phonemic density of each syllable, e.g. \uADF8 <em>g\u016D</em>
    is visually much sparser than \uB04A <em>gg\u016Dnh</em> as the latter packs more

    \"true\" Latinization: To me it remains an issue of intent. For example if you
    make the \u03B7 without a descender because you really believe the descender harms
    readability, then it's not Latinization; but if you do it because you want Greek
    to align better with Latin text (as opposed to sitting too low overall) then that

    of this thread and specifically the people who give enough thought to Greek type
    design to treat it with the respect it deserves. But you're right, there are some
    embarrassing instances of uncritical Latinization out there, with the Latin n
    glyph doubling as \u03B7.\r\n\r\nFor all my arguments in support of non-descending
    \u03B7, I would use the descending \u03B7 shape by default in my own designs unless
    I'm specifically targeting Greek-only use. An important reason that I would include
    Greek in my typefaces is that Greek letters are often used as symbols for technical
    purposes, for example in particle physics. To make \u03B7 recognizable for such
    purposes, the descender is a must. It's somewhat ironic perhaps that for me the
    best argument for a descending \u03B7 is to meet the expectations of a Latin-centric
    audience."

    descender as an indication of Latinization.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of variability
    in early Greek minuscule writing with respect to the baseline\u2014\u03B8 would
    frequently descend instead of sitting on the baseline as it does today, \u03BA
    may have an ascender, etc. A non-descending \u03B7 is common in these early stages;
    see the images in the table at [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_minuscule|the
    Wikipedia page on Greek minuscule]]. Many early Greek typefaces have \u03B7 without
    a descender and others have very short descenders.\r\n\r\nSo one need not invoke
    the influence of Latin to explain the non-descending \u03B7. To me, Apollonia
    (GFS Artemisia) is not a Latinized design at all. Notice how Apollonia's \u03B7
    does not have the typical serifs of an upright Latin n.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, of
    the three images that Tatiana posted as examples of Latinization, the first and
    the third are clear examples of substitution of the Latin n for \u03B7. Maybe
    not as painfully obvious as some of the Armenian substitutions in Hrant's example,
    but these are clearly n's masquerading as \u03B7's. The first image is particularly
    grating as other than \u03BA, \u03B7 is the only Greek letter with full serifs.
    The third image at least is consistent in going all out with the serifs.\r\n\r\nThe
    second image, assuming we're talking about the sans serif, does not strike me
    as an unambiguous case of Latinization (though I'm not a fan of the non-descending

    or Latinization are equally bad when carried out by foreigners who don't understand
    the nature of the script. (Actually, Latinization is worse in that case, as it
    is likely to be carried out with overt imperialistic intent.)\r\n\r\nLatinization
    carried out by native speakers of Greek who at least know what they're doing is,
    in my opinion, not only less bad, but even considerably less bad. In that case,
    what is genuinely important is likely to be preserved, and with any luck, mostly
    only that which is incidental and superficial will be lost.\r\n\r\nThus, look
    at \"alpha\" in the Latinized Greek typefaces we've seen in this thread - it is
    still a single-story a, not a Latin double-story a, and there are rather un-Latin
    things going on in the serifs. As long as the baby isn't thrown out with the bathwater,

    This is of course true for most Westerners since this is the only form they are
    familiar with. I don't think it's surprising that Greek typefaces made in the
    West settled on the form with the descender in the last couple of centuries to
    differentiate the \u03B7 from the Latin n.\r\n\r\nIt's just that I haven't seen
    any evidence yet that the Greeks themselves ever stopped writing the \u03B7 without
    a descender. If they've been using this form all along, you can't accuse them
    of cutting off a descender that wasn't there in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut I
    haven't seen much about Greek handwriting in Greece during the Ottoman period,
    and today's Greek handwriting seems to derive from copying printed forms (hence
    the ahistorical fish-shaped alpha) rather than historical handwritten forms, much
    like a lot of today's Latin handwriting."

    excellent ones, all seem to stop around AD 1600. The best are the <em>Repertorium
    ger griechischen Kopisten 800\u20131600</em>, each issue of which consists of
    three volumes devoted to manuscripts housed in a different country: one descriptive
    volume (in German), one volume of photographic plates, and most usefully a volume
    illustrating the characteristic form of letters occurring in each manuscript.
    A quick flip through the latter volume in the French issue reveals both descending
    and non-descending \u03B7 in use. Of particular interest, I think, is that the
    manuscript non-descending \u03B7 is often very difficult to distinguish from the
    cursive \u03BA, such that in many of the manuscripts that feature the non-descending
    \u03B7 the scribe uses a different form of \u03BA with a Latin K construction.
    Where both the non-descending \u03B7 abd cursive \u03BA are used, it is very difficult
    to distinguish them other than by textual context. This may provide some insight
    as to why the descending \u03B7 became the common typographic form: to contrast
    with the form of \u03BA that was adopted in the cursive types as the norm for
    that letter."

    of handwriting, the confusion between non-descending \u03B7 and \u03BA is an excellent
    reason for preferring the \u03B7 with a descender.\r\n\r\nTo keep playing the
    devil's advocate, strategies for disambiguating similar letters in handwriting
    are not necessarily translated to typography. \r\n\r\nIn Cyrillic handwriting,
    strokes may be added above or below <em>\u0442</em> and <em>\u0448</em> respectively
    to tell them apart because they can be identical when scribbled, but since in
    print these letters are easier to distinguish without additional strokes, these
    are not used, much as in print the strokes that some people add to the numeral
    7 or the letter z in handwriting are not used. Likewise, there is no danger of
    confusing the printed forms of non-descending \u03B7 and \u03BA, so there is no
    <em>necessity</em> to add the descender in print.\r\n\r\nHowever, if \u03B7 with
    a descender was indeed established as the exclusive handwritten form due to the
    above reason, then that may have contributed to the same form being adopted exclusively
    in print in later centuries. If this indeed became the only form used in handwriting
    or print, that would mean that from then on, \u03B7 canonically had a descender.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem I have with this narrative is that a lot of today's Greek handwriting
    uses non-descending \u03B7. This may be an innovation, a possibility that I admit
    didn't occur to me at first. But since a non-descending \u03B7 was already in
    common use centuries ago, I can't be sure."

    should be taken in consideration in designing typefaces. Handwriting and lettering
    styles and printed letterforms continuously influence each other, but rather subtly.
    Printed letterforms tend to be more conservative and to settle on a single normative
    form for a letter which can have several different forms when written by hand.
    The reason I brought up handwriting was to dispel the notion that a non-descending
    \u03B7 could only be explained as due to Latin influence, not to suggest that
    printed forms should take the cue from contemporary handwriting."

  body: "@jongseong:\r\n<cite>I am not saying it is not Latinized, but because monolinear
    sans serif designs are just basic skeletons of letters it is not conclusive whether
    the forms were arrived at by imitation of Latin forms or by a parallel geometric
    simplification. It is more obvious with high-contrast, serif designs where you
    have wholesale copying of Latin construction details such as the full foot serifs
    on the \u03B7.</cite>\r\n\r\nA very good point. To me, it <em>appears</em> that
    the descender on the eta is not a \"foot\", but a \"tail\", and ought to come
    to some kind of a point in a Roman serif typeface treatment of the Greek lower-case
    alphabet. But I could be completely wrong."

    doubt wether the use of the strokes in 7 and z is related to the use of the strokes
    that are used above or below <em>\u0442</em> and <em>\u0448</em> as in Cyrillic.
    As far as I know, the strokes in 7 and z were introduced by the calligraphers
    that wrote with the pointed flexible nib. Especially in the cursive styles, their
    horizontal parts were written with a wavy stroke that is thick in the middle (like
    in <em>\xF1</em>, the spanish tilde on <em>n</em>). The diagonal stroke in 7 and
    z was long and thin. The horizontal strokes in the middle of 7 and z optically
    compensate the large amount of white space in 7 and z. That\u2019s it. In typefaces,
    the hairlines are normally not that thin as in the pointed nib calligraphy styles,
    so from an optical point of view, usually there is no necessity for them. Unless
    a typeface merely mimicks the a cursive pointed flexible nib writing style with
    thin hairlines \u2026 The use of these strokes in handwriting is not exclusive
    to Russia. They are mainly a feature of the aforementioned script and you will
    find them in those countries where it has influenced the way handwriting has been
    taught. For example in Great Britain, France and the Netherlands and especially
    in documents from the time that this influence was large or still lasting. "

    many pages from elder books by other people) you will find many examples of historical,

    I bet you find them for 7 as well \u2026"

  body: "I think my uneasiness is mostly with the idea of full serifs on Greek minuscule
    letters. To me they still seem alien to formal Greek typography.\r\n\r\nIn the
    case of Latin typography, the grafting of majuscule-style full serifs to minuscule
    letters must have been similarly jarring at first. But it became so well established
    that you find this in formal handwritten styles from centuries ago, not just in
    typefaces. Below is an image originally posted by John Hudson in the [[http://typophile.com/node/37310?page=2|Rule
    or Law thread]] showing George Shelley's <em>Natural Writing in all the Hands,
    with Variety of Ornament</em> dating from 1709 (to emphasize, this is handwriting,
    not type):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shelley1709b_4107.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere,
    full serifs on the minuscule letters are part of the formal writing style. I haven't
    seen anything comparable with Greek minuscules. Maybe today's Greek typefaces
    with full serifs on minuscule letters will become fully established and be regarded
    as normal in the future. But until then, they will seem a bit off to me for anything
    other than display purposes.\r\n\r\nThat's part of my reservations about Centro
    serif, which I actually really like. It's more subtle and restrained in its deployment
    of full serifs on Greek minuscules than some examples that we've seen, but I would
    warm to it more as a neutral text face if it stuck closer to more authentic constructions."

    In the same book that Brian cites, George Shelley feels obliged to state that
    Bickham's 'Imitation falls short of my originals'. One of the things I have noticed
    in my research on the development of the English Roman is that when new styles
    are introduced by writing masters it takes a while for engravers to become proficient
    at cutting them. So, for examples, in the first example of the formal roman style
    that I've found, in John Seddon's 1695 book, it's cutting is notably crude compared
    the cursive styles and ornaments in the same publication. \r\n\r\nThis is drifting
    quite far off topic for the thread, so we can take this up elsewhere if of sufficient

  body: 'For me, the most obvious effect of Latinisation is not a cultural or ideological
    one, but a graphic one. When non-Latin scripts are subject to Latinisation, to
    processes of trying to make them ''more like Latin'', whether structurally or
    in terms of borrowed shapes or details, the result is almost always an awkward
    stiffness, the loss of organic feel. As I suggested earlier with reference to
    Gill and Van Krimpen, when Latin designers bring this approach to non-Latin types
    they seems to demonstrate a loss of the very sensibility that makes them successful
    designers in the Latin script: they end up producing parodies of their Latin types
    as much as parodies of the writing system for which they are designing. When native
    designers bringing a Latinisation approach to their own scripts, I''m often left
    wondering whether they''ve ever really looked at the Latin script or tried to
    understand its subtleties. ''Latin'' is often taken as a synonym for simplified,
    which leads to crude geometries and lack of sensitivity to relative proportions
    and how letters group together in words.'

  body: "No, I'm providing tools that I believe will solve the daily text needs of
    the users of that software or device, in response to particular briefs from the
    client. This means that I'm usually considering the kinds of texts they are likely
    to be dealing with and what norms exist in their native text cultures that I can
    draw on to produce something that fits the expectations of a significant portion
    of users (or at the very least can be presented to them and explained with reference
    to their own textual history, rather than as something imported). These days,
    I'm often working with scripts for which no fonts exist in widely supported or
    standard formats -- e.g. the Burmese font for Windows 8 --, working alongside
    the programmers who are developing the layout engines, keyboard drivers etc.,
    and I see my work very much in terms of producing something that provides a well
    executed baseline of script and language support according to the norms of the
    script, <em>so that anyone who comes after me can consider that solved and produce
    more original and creative designs.</em> This relates to the thread that Hrant
    tried to start regarding minority script support: a lot of scripts get hung up
    on amateur font makers trying hard to produce something that captures the norms
    of the script, such that no one ever gets around to expanding the typographic
    palette. \r\n\r\nI don't think I've ever claimed to be an 'advocate of cultural
    autonomy', at least not in any way that presents it as a problem for people to
    design typefaces for writing systems other than their own. This has been going
    on for as long as there has been type; sometimes it is done well, sometimes not.
    Generally, when it has been done well, the people involved have paid attention
    to script expertise embodied in the scribal traditions. Generally, when it has
    been done poorly, foreign technologies have imposed limitations and the people
    involved have imported inappropriate concepts from their own scripts.\r\n\r\n<em>True
    italics, multiple weights, condensed and expanded, text and display styles, small
    caps \u2014 all these \u201CLatin\u201D inventions can be theirs.</em>\r\n\r\nNo,
    I don't think all these inventions can be theirs, because some of these are dependent
    on particular characteristics that the Latin script does not share with all other
    scripts. Sometimes, in such cases, there are alternative options within the script,
    ironically overlooked in favour of Latinisation."

    at least, I could distinguish a tendency for Greek typefaces to approach the 'grey
    tone' or otherwise called 'the text colour' of latin typefaces. One way to achieve
    it is to cut off the descenders and ascenders or to reduce their height. Sometimes
    I do not encounter difficulties to read those kind of texts. But when 3 or more
    latinised letters are next to each other in a Greek word, then it seems like a
    spelling problem exists. I'll try to find such a text and to post a photo. \r\n"

    glyphs that are chopped, look like English or even Cyrillic.  I have a difficult
    time seeing how taking away visual information can increase readability. I know
    I am a very poor example because I am not a native Greek speaker but wonder on
    what basis this could be assumed without more scientific testing.\r\n\"Grey Tone\"
    as you call it or \"even color,\" as I might assume you mean, Do not require chopped
    glyphs. In fact, all capital letter text has been proven many times to read poorly
    compared to lower case.  I don't think Latin has more even color because of fewer
    descenders.  I think it is more even because of more regular sides.  This may
    not even help readability, I do not know.  I assume if we depart too far from
    what an audience expects, that we are doing more harm than good.  This theory
    that Panos seems to describe, appears to indicate that unicase would read better
    than lowercase text.  I find this hard to accept.  Then again, I am just one old

    I could have written them in a more simple way, without causing too much headache
    :)\r\nRegarding the results you posted in your last comment, it seems that the
    facts are a bit different (see q. 11, p.59 and then p.68, https://www.academia.edu/4101465/The_latinisation_of_greek_typographical_characters_EN_partial_version_).\r\nActually,
    65% (or 2 of 3 persons) DO care about the Greekness of letters and say NO to the
    approach of the substitution of Greek letters by Latin ones. While the other part,
    35% (or 1 of 3 persons) has no objection to the above mentioned approach. And
    I suppose you said the vice versa...\r\nBut the second part of your comment is
    a good one! A good thought for type designers. \r\nFrom my latests observations,
    more and more latinized typefaces are used in a large scale, especially by newspapers.
    \r\nBook publishers are more conservative, everyone understands why. While young
    people are more volatile towards latinized fonts. They are constantly looking
    for them!\r\nI would say that the \"Greek eye\" is tired of a very specific element:
    the big contrast between the thick and thin strokes of letters. Minimized contrast
    could be one of the approaches to new fonts, thus putting away latinization.\r\n\r\n***\r\nDear
    Tyophiles, do you think a summary of my research, like an eloquent presentation
    (in power point) would be more useful to readers?\r\n\r\nI still own to Typohiles
    the translation of the main part of the thesis into English, about the design
    characteristics of the Greek letters. And making the mentioned presentation will
    not be so difficult, since I already made it in Greek. But this will happen after
    I will finish my last BA project, as to say, after May month. \r\n\r\n***\r\nDear
