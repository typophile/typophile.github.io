		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t use any Font Managers. This is because:</p>
<ol>
<li>My job does not require me to have many fonts installed;</li>
<li>I work with Mac OS X, and — unlike OS 9 — it allows me to keep the fonts inside of folders, which I can manage at my discretion;</li>
<li>This way I know and have full control of which fonts are installed and where — made available to all the applications or just some;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a font developer and there are times when I need to generate and test tenths of fonts a day;</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easier to troubleshoot font problems because there&rsquo;s less font-cache issues to worry about.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having said that, I find that a big part of the problems that people run into regarding fonts, are related with cache issues. Therefore, it would be interesting if Font Managers could supply documentation on this matter, and provide (to their users and people in general) easy and detailed methods on how to solve this problem. (I&rsquo;m aware that Linotype FontExplorer X already does this to some extent.)</p>

<p>I keep all mine in folders, categorized by foundry. All my fonts are on CD as well, to keep them safe, and when I need one I just copy it from CD. I install/uninstall via FontBook, which is standard on OS X. Seems like the most sensible way to do things.</p>
<p>Even when I used Windows, I only used a font manager (mainly Typograf) to verify kerning pairs and such.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the rest of us, but I find that font managers tend to cause more harm than good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A big problem with testing fonts under development is that Mac OS X caches actual font data. When you activate an updated version of a font, either with a font manager or by placing it in a system font folder, you can&rsquo;t be certain that Mac OS has updated it&rsquo;s cache correctly. The only sure way is to clear the system caches, which requires a restart. I actually signed up for the font testing workshop at Typecon. I&rsquo;m really excited to hear what professional font testers have to say.</p>
<p>I think the font manager is a really useful piece of software for typesetters who use a lot of fonts. People who work in ad production for print or web may need to use a wide variety of typefaces because customers demand that their ad have a unique look and feel. Just to find a typeface in a certain class may involve looking at dozens of typefaces side by side. I suppose you could use the web based search tools, but many designers would prefer to restrict their previews to fonts they currently own and have readily available. Secondly if you have to go back and open old documents, its a real timesaver if the fonts simply turn on automatically.</p>
<p>Some designers are fortunate enough to be able to use the same few fonts. Others aren&rsquo;t so lucky, usually because they are working in a market where customers demand novelty.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i would love to see these companies say, transparently, what their programs actually do with font files when one lets them manage. the first installation is always terrifying. apple&rsquo;s fontbook was the most destructive, in my case.</p>
<p>i would also love to see manufacturers of designers' software tools taken to task for treating these applications as &ldquo;products,&rdquo; and rarely tools.</p>
<p>in my mind, designers' applications are products only before the sale is made. they become tools once they&rsquo;re committed to. i want no sales presence in my working environment, with very little exception.</p>
<p>this means, for example, i don&rsquo;t want to be forced to deal with the linotype store (although that is one of the handier applications of sales presence in the work environment), and i don&rsquo;t want an accidental click on the useless logo bar in adobe&rsquo;s illustrator package to lead me to its product page. that particular move makes no sense whatsoever, and i&rsquo;ve always resented it.</p>

<p>If Apple could somehow clean up all the places that programs install fonts that would be a big step forward. Like subfolders off the user/library/fonts folder. It&rsquo;s just not intuitive at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Two points:</p>
<p>The simple way to deal with Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; regarding font folders is to pick one (either the one in your home folder or the one at the root of the start up drive) and stick with it. Don&rsquo;t install fonts anywhere else. Ever.</p>
<p>The simple way for font developers to avoid font cache problems is to always rename your font (Myfont A, Myfont B, Myfont C, etc.) when you generate a new version. It takes a little extra effort, but it has other benefits, including being able to have multiple versions of your font open at the same time for comparison, and it&rsquo;s much, much less hassle than cleaning the cache.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For font design purposes, I also rename work in progress adding a prefix or suffix to have a trail of work history. This is a whole new ballgame for graphic design use where you need a big range of fonts available for production.  I also wish utility developers would further demystify what happens when fonts are turned on and off or placed in sets.  I don&rsquo;t know who holds the key to the solution but what is out there now needs some help and collaboration between application software, design software, and font management software.  The trouble is that there is not a big chunk of change in font management software so developers don&rsquo;t want to put much resource into it.</p>
