  web fonts for a website.\r\n\r\nFor western European languages the site will use
  Helvetica Neue Light, Helvetica Neue Bold and Baskerville Italic.\r\n\r\nBut the
  site will also appear in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Korean, and I'm trying
  to find web fonts for those languages that are appropriate equivalents of Helvetica
  Neue and Baskerville Italic.\r\n\r\nGoogling for recommendations has just confused
  me further. Some people even suggest there's no sense using web fonts for Asian
  character sets because the file sizes would be impractically large. Others suggest
  that italic fonts aren't appropriate.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help suggest what approach
  I should take here?\r\n\r\nAny advice very much appreciated.\r\n"

    \ For written Chinese there are two forms:  traditional and simplified.   Simplified
    Chinese is used only in the PRC.    \r\n\r\nKorean has fewer characters than there
    are letters in the English alphabet, so file size wouldn't be an issue there regarding
    web fonts.   \r\n\r\nThis site may be useful (turn Google translator on): \r\nhttp://www.justfont.com\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Dave, that's really helpful. justfont.com looks promising.\r\n\r\nI
    also discovered that fonts.com uses 'dynamic subsetting' to only download the
    characters you need for the current page, mitigating the problem of large file
    sizes.\r\n"

  body: "Yes, please take a look at our [[http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts|Fonts.com
    Web font service]]. It has both the Neue Helvetica and Baskerville web fonts you
    are looking for. And Fonts.com has an extensive selection of Simplified Chinese
    and Traditional Chinese web fonts as well (along with many other languages too).
    \r\n\r\nAs you pointed out, the Fonts.com Web font service uses dynamic subsetting
    for all Chinese, Korean and Japanese fonts. Dynamic subsetting automatically detects
    and instantly delivers the Web fonts for only the characters that are used, thus
    dramatically reducing font file size and web font download times. I hope you find
    this to be a solution that will solve your problem."
