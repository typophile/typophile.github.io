  Bold&#40;9pxBold&#41; &amp; Large&#40;12px&#41;. <BR>i stoped working on the font
  because it seemed very ugly and tastless all of a sudden. most of all, it looks
  very boring. looks like a font somebody has allready made. <BR>  <BR>please be frank
  with me and tell me what you really think. <BR> <BR>/image{camilla v1} '

    something fresh in the squarishness of  <BR>the larger version too. '

  body: ' I like the 9n caps. The tight inter-letter <BR>spacing reminds me a little
    of Crouwel&#39;s design <BR>for the &#39;vormgevers&#39; poster. There are details
    <BR>to be worked out of course. The 12px version <BR>is very nice, though the
    &#39;r&#39; could be narrower. '

  body: k, just had conversation with boss, he suggests that the ascenders, decenders
    are a bit long. - you&#39;d need a lot of leading on this font. things crashing
    into each other in your text body copy there. <BR> <BR>there&#39;s no dot on the
    i, j....we think that&#39;s fun.
