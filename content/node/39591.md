    have some sort of web mail application.\r\nIf you go to your web mail you can
    almost certainly block the mails there already so they do not even reach your
    computer."

  body: "<em> If you go to your web mail you can almost certainly block the mails
    there already so they do not even reach your computer.</em>\r\nYes, but the \"sender\"
    is the ATypI list (but then again the on other mail that would have been blocked
    would have been the complaints about the mail). I would have done that if it didn't
    stop by now. 456 copies of the same mail isn't too bad is it?\r\n\r\nSetting up
    a rule to sort them into trash is fine but checking a mobile device during the
    day was an exercise in frustration.\r\n\r\nA year or two ago we had an announcement
    stuck in a loop where it send 6 times in a row. The hate mail and phone calls
    started flowing like crazy. We pulled the plug and then apologized to everyone
    and cancelled the list and asked them to re-subscribe to a new list. Those who
    did got a free font."

    I get all the list messages with the original sender as sender ('From') and the
    ATypI list as 'Reply-To'."

    e-mail address, which for me was not the ATypI listserve, but the person posting.
    Thank goodness, too, because there were about 200+ messages this morning pushed
    over into the quarantine folder. \r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
