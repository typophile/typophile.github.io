    happy to learn and apply (or in my case- yet to apply.)\r\n\r\nI plan on replacing

    they do know that -- they aren't really a bunch of amateurs. It's you who don't
    seem to know there are many old browsers still in use today which have no support
    for transparent PNG and partly only incomplete support for transparent GIF. Therefore,
    instead of having their favicon look nice on some browsers and broken on others,
    they'd rather have it look acceptable on all browsers -- it's a compatibility
    issue.\r\n\r\nA PR principle of big corps: You can't win much, but you can loose

    a tired old standard. I sunk the baseline on the y to make it connect with the

    curling stones (at least until recently) come from the same Scottish quarry on
    the island of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailsa_Craig\">Ailsa Craig</a>
