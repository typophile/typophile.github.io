body: 'Using the document grid, some rectangles and the Pathfinder function, I roughed
  out a few letters in InDesign. Then I wanted to see what they&#39;d look like with
  rounded corners, so I used Object&#62;Corner Effects to apply a 3pt rounded corner.
  <BR> <BR>Although pleased with the effect, I was disappointed that some of the corners
  remained sharp &#40;see below&#41;. Moving the original sharp-angled shapes into
  Illustrator and applying Effect&#62;Stylize&#62;Round Corners yielded the same uneven
  results. <BR> <BR>A couple of questions: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Does anyone know a way
  to get consistent round corners on non-primitive shapes in InD/Illy? Could it have
  anything to do with the order in which I used Pathfinder to hack off corners and
  counters? <BR> <BR>2&#41; Is there a command/effect/filter that rounds the corners
  by actually moving/creating Bezier points, rather than just changing the way the
  shape is displayed? In other words, I&#39;d like my shapes to look rounded in both
  the Preview and Outline views in Illustrator. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/69333.jpg"

  body: I believe the builtin effect isn&#39;t capable of rounding all corners. <BR>There
    is an Illy plugin that was mentioned here a few months  <BR>ago, but I can&#39;t
    find it - even with Google.

    target="_blank">this</a> but it&#39;s more of a one-corner-at-a-time solution.

  body: I&#39;ll bet this can be scripted pretty easily. In fact, I think there may
    be a script for this that comes with InDesign, in the Goodies folder on the CD
    maybe? &#40;When I install from work I don&#39;t get all those extras, which is
    why I&#39;m not quite certain.&#41; <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks for the tip, Stephen! I always forget about Adobe Studio. <BR> <BR>I
    tried out the action, with mixed results. It usually works as expected, but when
    it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s a pain to undo because the action includes a combination
    of cutting/pasting/path expanding, which Illustrator can&#39;t reverse in one
    fell swoop. <BR> <BR>Thomas, I&#39;m in the same boat you are. My employeer has
    a mult-seat license for the CS apps and our IT guys handle the installation, so
    I never see install disks. But I&#39;ll force one of them to break into the safe
    and hand over the CDs... ;&#41;
