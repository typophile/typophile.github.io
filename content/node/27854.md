  in Illustrator and InDesign, but can't seem to work out how. I have read and found
  I'll need Open Type to make it work?\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to type, any help would
  be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    are standard in Postscript typeface \uFB01 + \uFB02?\r\n\r\nOr do you mean special
    ones that are built in with Opentype in certain typefaces?\r\n\r\nAnd\u2026what
    typeface are we talking about?"

  body: "In In Design, take a text box, change the font to Minion Pro, type \u2018st\u2019,
    \u2018fi\u2019 or something like that. Then, from the fly out menu (the small
    triangle button) check \u2018Ligatures\u2019 and if you wish, from the Opentype
    submenu, check Discretionary Ligatures. Um, hope this helps.\r\n\r\n<em>Edit:

  body: "Search for \"ligature\" in the InDesign help facility, and read \"To apply
    ligatures to letter pairs\": In InDesign the character palette has a fly-out menu
    accessed from the little arrow in a circle on the top right: click on  \"Ligatures\"
    in that menu. \r\n\r\nSearch for \"ligature\" in the Illustrator help facility,
    and read \"To use ligatures and contextual alternates\": In Illustrator, chose
    \"Ligatures\" from the similar fly-out menu in the Opentype palette. \r\n\r\nOf
    course, you won't get any ligatures if the font designer didn't put them in the
    font, but most fonts have at least \"fi\" and \"fl\"."

  body: This may be a little obvious, but you may want to check to see if the font
    you are using has the ligatures you are looking for. Not all typefaces have all
    ligatures. Some may not have any.
