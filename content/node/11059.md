  As part of the package, I&#39;ve done a semi-serif version of VAG Rounded for headline

  on selling it to the world at large, but are there any restrictions on selling this
  modified font to them? Do they need a liscense for VAG Rounded? <BR> <BR>Thanks,

  body: Legally &#40;at least in [most of] the civilized world&#41; they need to own
    the original&#39;s license to the extent that the derivative will be used. Ethically,
    I would add that public credit must be given to the original. Some would add to
    that the requirement that you ask the owner of the original for permission, but
    that&#39;s too much of a &#34;fraternity&#34; farce for me to take seriously.
    <BR> <BR>On the other hand, some EULAs are stricter &#40;like Emigre&#39;s and
    MS&#39;s&#41;, but I wonder about the validity of all their clauses outside the
    US. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant&#39;s position seems reasonable. I think John Hudson would still argue
    the commission vs. liscense issue... I dunno. Since I&#39;m not trying to sell/distribute
    this font to the world at large, and they have a VAG liscense, what are the creators
    loosing out on? Did they put in the work to make a semi- serif version?  <BR>
    <BR>Ah...... Did I put in the work to make a semi serif version? There is the
    issue eh? Yes, and no. But, I believe I&#39;ve paid for the step ahead I&#39;ve
    received, in the licensing process. &#40;maybe&#41; <BR> <BR>Gotta go. <BR>Randy

    not sure that I understand this comment, but basically I agree with Hrant&#39;s
    summary of the legal and ethical requirement: you need to ensure that a&#41; the
    original font license permits such modification and b&#41; that the client has
    a legitimate license that covers <i>every installation</i> of your modified font.  <BR>  <BR>Regarding
    asking permission, this should be clearly granted or not in the original license.
    Personally, if someone were to come to me and ask me to make a modification of
    a typeface from another small foundry, I would probably contact the original designer
    and see if they were interested in being involved. There are lots of ways this
    could work, from co-design to consulting. I don&#39;t think this is an ethical
    requirement, just something that I would do in the spirit of fraternal farce that
    Hrant mocks.'

  body: I think it&#39;s a very good idea if you already know the original designer
    in question, and it&#39;s also fine if you want to use the project as an opportunity
    to get to know him. But the pressure of an Unwritten Fraternal Ritual where the
    results of not following The Dictates of the Holy Order are that you will be shunned
    by The Brothers of Leadhead is too medieval even for my tastes. Don&#39;t laugh
    - I know designers who think like that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    I meant John <i>Butler</i>. I posted after re-reading the thread that Joe linked
    to &#40;thanks&#41;. I was referring to what Mr. Hudson said in a post there:
    <BR> <BR><i>&#62;There is no pillaging if the thing is paid for.  <BR> <BR>Exactly.
    And fonts are not &#34;paid for&#34; generally. They are licensed. You can license
    a font package for generally between $0 and $150 a weight. Actually paying for
    a font, also called a commission or a work for hire, generally will cost you several
    orders of magnitude more... [elswhere]  If you want to draw your own Jenson, no
    one is stopping you. If you want to make something derived from the digital outline
    data in Adobe Jenson or FB Hightower, you damn well better contact Adobe or Font
    Bureau and talk to their staff. </i> <BR> <BR>So much for consensus. :-&#41; Valid
    points all around. At a bare minimum it seem everyone <i>must</i> own a lisense
    for the orginal, and that lisense <i>must</i> allow modification. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    all. <BR>Randy'

  body: 'Well, I&#39;ve noticed at least one area of strong disagreement, especially
    with Johns: <BR>I happen to think there is such a thing as an unreasonable EULA,
    because: <BR>1&#41; No type design is wholly original anyway. <BR>2&#41; The necessities
    of human society. The French Revolution was &#34;illegal&#34; too. <BR> <BR>The
    line that the creator of a font must have absolute legal control of it -even if
    it&#39;s considered capricious by any <i>reasonable</i> person- holds no water
    for me. Violating a law must be an <i>individual</i> decision - society is made
    of individuals, not parts of a machine. Unreasonable idiots must suffer the consequences,
    although those who stand up to them should be ready for the battle as well. <BR>
    <BR>For example, the MS EULA prohibits any modification whatsoever, even if it&#39;s
    for internal pleasure. I heartily encourage people to violate that clause - I
    don&#39;t think saving MS money in potential support costs due to the existence
    of &#34;nonstandard&#34; versions of their fonts is more important than the acquisition
    of technical font expertise through experimentation, and the hacking of fonts
    to improve internal functionality. On the other hand, I don&#39;t condone the
    <i>distribution</i> of such modified fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    it failed, it would have been an extremely &#34;illegal&#34; rising/rebellion
    and the leaders would have been done away with and things would have probably
    continued on much as before.  <BR> <BR>The fact that it was a successful revolution
    meant that the revolutionaries could rewrite the rules &#40;and the history books&#41;
    themselves and justify everything and do away with whoever they wanted.  <BR>
    <BR>I reckon distribution of hacked fonts would be far more revolutionary than
    the hacking itself. If it was done on a large enough scale the rules would have
    to change. Not that I condone that sort of thing. Nor do I agree with cutting
    people&#39;s heads off. <BR> <BR>Matha
