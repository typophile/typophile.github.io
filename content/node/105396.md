  body: "Might not be a font. Note the \xAE for the conjoined BA.\r\nNo commercial
    matches at Myfonts or Linotype thar I could spot.\r\nSomewhat similar style for
    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/sf-wasabi.font?fpp=50\">SF Wasabi</a>.\r\nMore
    faux Chinese & Japanese fonts at:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=201&fpp=50\r\nI
    checked other sites with large collections of faux Chinese & Japanese fonts &
    also did not see a match.\r\nIn the other hand, further searching might turn up
    a match.\r\nDon"
