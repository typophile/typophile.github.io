  than usual (so deliberative driving, not immersive :-) and something hit me*: I
  saw a \"p\" with its shear at the bottom in the opposite direction as Interstate.
  In know that Interstate is touted as a \"cleaned-up\" version of the FHWA design
  (with this particular difference striking me as chirographic in motivation - and
  actually less effective than the original) and now I've become quite interested
  in analysing the differences between the two. I think such analysis would expose
  interesting clues as to how a designer thinks. If TFJ himself would elaborate, that
  would of course rule.\r\n\r\n* I mean besides that loose bumper piece - damn thing
  knocked a fog light loose.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Montalbano were trying to get the highway admin. to approve the \"Clearview\"

    (series-d) created. The last I heard about the project was over a year ago. I

    Clearview design has been granted interum approval by FHWA for use on all federal
    roads. Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia have started using the fonts for
    various aspects of their transportation signage. There are a number of states
    that are poised to make the change to Clearview. \r\n\r\nThe fact that some kid
    slammed Clearview for being un-American only makes me happy."

  body: "Hrant, Interstate is far better than the actual FHWA. I believe I've even
    seen signs using the redraw instead of the official FHWA original. \r\n\r\nJames,
    I also wanted to tell you that I've been on quite a few roadtrips through Pennsylvania.
    Your typeface is VERY legible and one of the best uses of functional typography
    I have ever seen. You should really be proud of your work. Anyone on the road
    could not disagree with that. "

  body: "Is it possible that the \"p\" that sparked this whole thread was in fact
    a \"q\" applied backwards?  I've seen a sign that used an upside down \"m\" instead
    of a \"w\".  Anyway, all the sheared stems in FHWA are cut southwest-to-northeast.
    \ Does Interstate do that differently with some letters?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I
    also like the new Clearview fonts for the most part; I'm not so enthusiastic about
    the numerals, however.  I thought the FHWA numerals were quite effective, and
    some of the Clearview numerals look too much alike -- specifically, the free strokes
    of the 6 and 9 curve back towards the loops more than in FHWA, making them less
    distinct from 8.  I also miss the inflection in the middle of the curved stroke
    of the 2, but that may be more a matter of personal taste than function.\r\n\r\nDoes
    this font make me look fat?"
