body: "Hi, everyone. I'm a longtime lurker but now I have a type ID questions so I
  thought I'd ask the board. I'm doing a project for class where we had to find a
  monument in NYC with type on it and identify as best we can. \r\n\r\nI'm looking
  to identify this typeface engraving. I think it looks a little like Trajan but a
  little more condensed and smaller serifs. It was engraved around 1975 and it is
  across the street from the UN building in New York City in Ralph Bunche Park. \r\n\r\nAny
  help or nudges in the right direction would be very much appreciated."

    to those laid out by Albrecht D\xFCrer and others. Trajan is a reasonable approximation."
