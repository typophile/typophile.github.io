    some weight.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, use your best judgment and taste. I happen to think
    Aspect is beautiful in its simplicity. I wouldn't use it for a punk zine -- or
    maybe that would be a really cool, unexpected approach!"

    going to use Aspect for playing out all of it's ligatures? It is perfectly \"minimal
    baroque\".\r\n\r\nLook after Goodness & Truth \r\n& Beauty will look after itself"
