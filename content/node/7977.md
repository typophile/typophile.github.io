  Poverty. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a font based in early Renaissance typefaces as well as
  inscriptional letters found in paintings from the XVI and XVII centuries. <BR> <BR>At
  present it&#39;s optical size its suitable for display. Maybe, in the future, I
  will create another version for text use. Italics may come as well.  <BR> <BR>After
  having been working on this font for as long as I can remember I have a reached
  a point where your help is needed, my eye may bypass some details clearly visible
  to an experienced type designer. <BR> <BR>Hope you like it!<!--attachment: Poverty_Second_Test-55023.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*326.0*Poverty+Sample+Sheet*Poverty+Second+Test%2epdf
