body: "Hello, this is my first post here, and my first attempt at a full typeface
  I can use for my own 'image'.  I started by taking Myriad Pro, and using FontLab
  tranformations to round the corners.  I soon realised this wasnt enough for the
  look I needed, so taking some basic inspiration, I began drawing some characters
  and playing around to get the look right.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunatly I am not very experienced
  with font design, I have a few books, and I have looked at many custom made fonts,
  to get a feel for characters and proportions.  Anyway, I thought I would register
  and post some samples.  I would ideally like to find a font professional who could
  take my glyphs and make it all work, but I have little cash, and would ideally like
  to learn it for myself.\r\n\r\nThis may upset some people, but I design my glyphs
  to a grid in Corel Draw, the shapes just seem more solid to me rather than FontLab
  itself or of course Illustrator.  I have trouble getting the glyphs I perfect in
  Corel to import perfect in FontLab or FontLab Studio, but for now, I would like
  some advice, criticism, or even some harsh words said to me, about my designs so
  far.\r\n\r\nAttached is a PDF of the letter shapes I have drawn to demonstrate the
  look I want, as well as a gif for those who dislike PDF, I have also posted an example
  of the first version, the Edited Myriad I used for my personal logotype..."

  body: "You say \"my own image\" but you don't say what that is. I think you have
    to define the target before you can see how good your aim is.  Also, if this is
    your own image, why start with an existing typeface particularly one that is so
    often used that you will not give yourself an identity other than a \"just one
    of the crowd\" kind? The point of a custom identity font is that it be unique
    enough to the entity it represents to establish identity. It is kind of like choosing
    the name \"Store\" as a brand name, it says nothing about you and is so common
    it will be ignored.\r\nInstead of looking for a model to start with like Myriad.
    \ Start from scratch and make it you.  I know, it is a lot more work--but so is
    making a good apple pie from scratch more work than getting one out of a vending
    machine.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I too would like some additional glyphs to see - but I can say that the heavy
    weight needs to be adjusted to maintain legibility. Take a look at Univers in
    diffeent weights - see how the counters don't disappear? And take a looks at :\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/CostaPTF\r\n\r\nHe
    does it slightlty differnetly but the idea is the same.\r\n\r\nBoth examples maintain
    legibility in heavy weights a way that your face won't right now. See why?"

    acceptable for learning purposes but you won't be allowed to release or distribute
    a typeface created that way. Just checking :)\r\n\r\nA."
