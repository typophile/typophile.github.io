  'NI'. However, I'm having trouble finding them. I'm keen on seeing how other designers
  have handled what is otherwise a very bland combination of letters. Aside from the
  diagonal in the N, there isn't much to work with!\r\n\r\nCan anyone make any suggestions?"

    use the end stroke to allude to an ''I'', perhaps with a break at the bottom of
    the ''I''.'

  body: "That's funny Tim, I googled the same term \"NI logo\", but forgot to use
    the image feature, and instead clicked on a bunch of website links that returned
    very little in the way of logos.\r\n\r\nHere's my first stab. It's for a B2B company.
    This probably isn't the right forum for a logo critique, so I'll keep the post
    to one example only.\r\n\r\nI like this design because it: infers the 'i' using
    positive and negative space; uses some basic optical illusion techniques to bend
    an otherwise straight line, and the circle itself creates a sense of movement,
    and therefore drama.\r\n\r\nHowever, it makes me think of airliners a bit. :(\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStephen,
    I am always excited to receive your feedback. Try as I might, however, I can't
    seem to get my mojo around the specific direction you describe. Regardless, I'd
    like to thank you for your suggestions.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo3_6113.gif]"

  body: So this last image isn't a sample? I really like where it is going. The diagonal
    needs to narrow at the bottom and the dot made a little smaller. IMHO

  body: "Thanks everyone, for your support. Miss Tiffany, I've taken your feedback
    and revised the logo a bit. I'm sure you intended something slightly different
    (e.g. the bell-bottom effect of the bottom-diagonal), but overall, thanks to your
    direction, the new shape is less graphical, and more typographical.\r\n\r\nThe
    hollow version is just and experiment to marry the negative space of the i with
    the positive space of the n. Further, really like the idea of the contrasting
    graphical elements: strong, straight verticals in one color, round, hollow shapes
    in another color, all married together.\r\n\r\nIt may be a bit 'art school', but
    then what do I know; I never went to art school!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo8_3519.gif]"
