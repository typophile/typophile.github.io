  applied... My search started for this as a friend was creating a logo for me and
  told me about a book that he found, that details fonts and how they were applied..
  I've since not had much contact with him, so the book/s names are not available
  to me. I like the old font's that were used to create logos of cars, used on newspapers
  etc from the 30's, 40's and 50's.. sorry to be so vague on this.. I don't know too
  much right now.. but I'm eager to learn as I want to create designs used with these
  type of fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMr H"
