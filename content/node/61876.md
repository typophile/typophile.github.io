  body: The best practice is to provide small capitals for all lowercase and upper
    case letters (including diacritical variants) within the font.

  body: "To get to grips with this I have started to compile a spreadsheet which helps
    alot when grabbing lists of letters for Opentype code.\r\nI haven't got quite
    this far yet - but if you had 4 columns, (expressed here in rows!) might help...\r\n\r\n[1]
    lowercase, (list continues with diacritics)\r\n[2] Capitals, (list continues with
    diacritics)\r\n[3] small caps: lowercase alternates, (list continues with diacritics)\r\n[4]
    small caps: Capitals alternates, (list continues with diacritics)\r\n\r\nOnce
    small caps are done - it might take me a day to sort out diacritics\r\nand when
    that's done the duplicate 'Capital alternate' set should be simple enough to populate.\r\n\r\nGood
    Luck."
