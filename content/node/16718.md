body: "I'm trying to remember the name of this typeface, but I don't have a sample
  other than this horrible sketch done from memory.  The key is that the G is separated
  into two parts, and the trapezoid is larger at the top than bottom.  The typeface
  is probably more bold and condensed than my sketch, and less cartoony.\r\n\r\nYou
