  body: Ray&#39;s Silentina appears to be based partly on an old BB&amp;S face called
    Pastel. I learned about Pastel when a guy contacted me a year or two ago wanting
    to know what font was used for the intertitles in a particular film he was restoring.
    Silentina Film matches the intertitles this guy showed me pretty well. The main
    difference from Pastel is in the caps and punctuation.

  body: Yes, I was curious. Thank you. Btw, I have been looking for silent film era
    type that has a swash lc &#39;r&#39;, &#39;v&#39; and &#39;w&#39;. I may have
    to scan a sketch and post it in a new thread... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    who contacted me about the font. I wondered if Silentina was more than a coincidence.
    Those scans of Pastel he has on that page were sent to him by me. I was too busy
    at the time to do anything with it. Obviously, he got tired of waiting for me
    to do something with it and had better luck with Ray. Oh, well.'

    also seems to have intertitle qualities. <BR> <BR>Edit: I would like to express
    my deepest gratitude for passing along the friend known as Silentina. Sixteen

  body: I&#39;m currently working on titling a silent film myself, so I&#39;ve been
    studying the various types used. Silentina is an excellent match for the type
    which was commonly used, but there were others. I&#39;ve seen Parsons and Hunt
    Speedball lettering used often as well. Camelot Oldstyle is also an excellent
    candidate, as well as the Meyer and Cantoria already mentioned. Some, if not many,
    silent films had hand-lettered titles, often done in the style of Fred Cooper.

  body: While not worthy of Mark Simonson&#39;s ever excellent &#39;Typecasting&#39;,
    it bothers me to no end that in the restoration of G.W. Pabst&#39;s <i>&#39;Diary
    of a Lost Girl&#39;</i> &#40;released by Kino Int&#39;l&#41;, Glorietta was used
    in the descriptive intertitles, as well as the usage of Cezanne to represent Thymiane&#39;s
    handwriting. <BR> <BR>I just needed an appropriate place to vent my irritation.

    obsessed if every reproduction I produced was set in Silentina.
