  of the PDF claims it was called &#34;New York Vogue&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried
  all the usual Futura suspects. None have this &#39;M&#39; with <BR>the straight
  sides. Not Drescher or FF Super Grotesk either. I <BR>feel there&#39;s a good chance
  it could be a cheapo knockoff due <BR>to the inconsistencies in stem width &#40;rounds
  are thicker than <BR>straights and so on&#41;. The figures are also wacky. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a shame they&#39;ve done such a poor job digitizing it.

  body: I&#39;ve had my eye on Vogue for a long time. It&#39;s a lost treasure, in
    my opinion.
