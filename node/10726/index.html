		<div class="commentbody">Times is actually one of my favourites. It is neutral, and lets the text content be in the focus.  And now I'm not talking about the 12 point Linotype Times version that comes with most printers. It is too condensed and has too much contrast to work well as a body text face in my book. Take a look at Times Ten, Linotype's 10-point version, which is thicker, wider and has less contrast. Very good for body text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Morison never intended to create a stunning, beautiful typeface with Times New Roman. It was purposely made to be neutral and free from bells and whistles. There is a charm in that approach too, I think. I do like old classic typefaces like Jenson, though.  But it doesn't fit in every situation. Imagine a bill set in Adobe Jenson&hellip; <BR>There's a reason that Times is &quot;overused&quot;, not only the fact that it comes with printers. It is simply a good and versatile typeface (as long as one doesn't use the 12-point version for body text that is).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have to use Helvetica Condensed and Times for our corporate typefaces. I'm sick of both. Times is flat, dead, unpleasant, and tricky to set in a manner that doesn't hark back to its intended use, which is (of course) not what we need it for. <BR> <BR>A close second for me is Gill Sans. There are a lot of unoriginal art directors out there working for big manufacturing companies, and they love their Gill. A lot of our work has to take on the look of our business partners, so we routinely work with a variety of 'identities'. I'd kill to work with faces like DIN or Minion on a regular professional basis, overused or not. <BR> <BR>I run into a lot of Adobe Garamond, but for some reason that doesn't bother me so much. ::shrug:: <BR> <BR>I think the reason that Times and TNR are so overused is a) default b) <i>free</i> c) the apocryphal story about how it's the 'most legible' typeface. <BR> <BR>TNR isn't terrible at face value, I just wish people would set type on long measures that was intended for long measures. Also, most people use 12 pt for the same reasons, it's the default. Plus, it makes their writing appear longer. I think the default should be set to Zapf Dingbats. Force people to make their own decisions and set up their own defaults. ::thumbs nose at Microsoft Office::</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Walter Tracey goes into this in depth in <i>Letters of Credit</i>. Basically, if I remember correctly, the proportions of Times New Roman were based off of an old (original ?) cut of Plantin. <BR> <BR>The bold, which was developed later by Monotype's drawing office (without Morison?) was designed so that each letter has the same width as the Regular. This is why the bold looks so terrible</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another thing about the Bold is that it has vertical stress while the Regular's is oblique (see the &quot;o&quot;). From what I understand this was a practical thing: the Bold was mainly intended for use for headings in The Times newspaper, and some people* think vertical stress is better for news. <BR> <BR>* Earlier this year JFP pointed out that many people report getting uncomfortable viewing fonts with oblique stress. I think this makes sense, although it's probably confined to deliberative reading; I think oblique stress probably improves immersive reading. Same thing with serif versus sans, btw. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
