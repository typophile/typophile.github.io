  and I'm using futura extra bold \u2013 All caps.\r\nI'm translating the title in
  other languages, and I want to try to make a japanese and/or korean version.\r\nThe
  problem is that japanese kanji/katakana/hiragana are really bound to calligraphy:
  is it possible, in your opinion, to create a \"geometric\" version of them (example:
  \u3093) and maintain legibility and recognizability?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nAM"

    geometric. \r\n\r\nFor Korean:\r\n\r\n[[http://yoonfont.co.kr/shop/font_han_view.asp?itemidx=1702|\uC724\uCCB4
    (Yoon-che)]]\r\n[[http://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/shop/product_down_read.asp?idx=728&category=211|\uC544\uD2B8\uCCB4

    (Yullyeo)]]\r\n\r\nThe last of these is definitely a display face, but for a magazine
    masthead it should work really well.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the classic
    geometric Korean face is [[http://www.hanyang.co.kr/font_pds/php/view.php?idx=35|\uC548\uC0C1\uC218\uCCB4]],
    (Ahn Sang-Soo, 1985), the eponymous design by Ahn Sang-Soo. This is also definitely
    a display face."
