  body: It reminds me of Democratica from Emigre, but that's not it. I see some sloppy
    manipulation of a clarendon too.

  body: "I have to say that I tried looking for this when you first posted it, and
    I looked at a number of sites. I had no luck with a list I had of Democratica-like
    styles, and I couldn't find this among the freebies at Dafont. \r\n\r\nYour best
    bet might be to write to the owner of the site where you saw this, and just ask
    them what was used. Often that approach will work.\r\n\r\n[edit: It's too bad
    your first post had so few replies, but that usually means no one knows the answer.
    Sometimes a font is just too unknown, or it is a custom font.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Wow, thank you for your reply, you make things very clear to me.\r\nIn fact,
    I did the same, I searched on dafont and other websites like that and I didn't
    find the font I wanted.\r\nI thought it would be very easier to ask here and to
    find the font.\r\n\r\nThis font is used on the second album of David Archuleta,
    it called Christmas from the Heart. So, if I understand what you said, I have
    to ask to the label, Jive Records ?\r\n\r\nIf I have to (for having this font...),
    I have no choice.\r\nThank you again for your reply.\r\n\r\nPS : Oh... And sorry
    for my english..."
