  body: Yes. The fear that is put into all designer&#39;s is that the family will
    get involved. However, it is a reality. I make a point of always talking very
    openly about who will be involved in the decision making from the beginning. I
    ask about there likes and dislikes. We discuss why this is good or bad. Etc. Being
    open from the beginning helps everyone. Even with bigger companies. Granted I&#39;m
    not sure it works that way with corporations, but I&#39;m sure within the larger
    realmn &#40;so to speak&#41; you still have an equivalent with which you have
    to deal. <BR> <BR>BJ, the sans is Cholla. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
