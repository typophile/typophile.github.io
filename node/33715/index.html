<p>Pressing the next page button wouldn’t be too bad if the button lacked the resistance that is added to most buttons just for the sake of being there.

I&rsquo;ll have to think about it some more.</p>
<p>In a children&rsquo;s book (in Armenian) that I typeset in the early 90s I determined the linebreaks manually according to meaning (although the left margin was straight).

<p>It reminds me of how 1960s art directors would set adspeak, like the transcript of a sales pitch. (On the premise advertising is &ldquo;salesmanship in print&rdquo;.) With lots of incomplete sentences, and copious paragraph returns to visually break up the text.

<p>Which is, of course, one of the ways in which verse is broken into lines, although not the only way.</p>
<p>Thai is always broken by phrasing, but in that case the breaking is not by lines but using spaces. Individual words within phrases are not spaced. This means that Thai would lend itself very easily to the kind of arrangement shown in the VSTF method, since the analysis by phrase has already been done, and you would only need to replace the space characters with line breaks. I can imagine that editing an English text for this method might be an interesting task. It seems to me that what the VSTF method is doing a lot of is extra-visualising punctuation, i.e. they are using linebreaks to emphasise things that are already explicit in a well-punctuated text. Of course, a lot of punctuation is stylistically discretionary, so the linebreaks can also be compensatory for absent punctuation. This means someone is making editorial decisions about possibly ambiguous phrasing.</p>
<p>Of course, the whole thing rests on the assumption that the text in question has a singular meaning that can be determined by breakdown of phrases. Recently I&rsquo;ve been talking with Fiona Ross and Robert Bringhurst about Sanskrit examples in which entire sentences are written without punctuation or word breaks in order to be deliberately ambiguous. Fiona cited examples by the writer Bana, in which a sentence might have three different meanings, depending how you divided it up.</p>

<p>Dividing up a SINGLE sentence might divide up people democratically as some smart Arabs did 1400 years ago with this verse of the Holy book that reads:
« And none knows its interpretation, save only God+those firmly rooted in knowledge.
They (those firmly rooted in knowledge) say We believe in it, it is all from our Lord.»</p>
<p>Just by placing a must-stop sign, this very verse is made to read:
«  And none knows its interpretation, save only God. (it remains a puzzle)
And those firmly rooted in knowledge say We believe in it, it is all from our Lord.»</p>
<p>Thus emphasizing that no body knows the Holy book but God and anybody 
with Arabic understanding can interpret it as he/she understands it?!
That&rsquo;s why they majority of Muslims:</p>
<ol>
<li>do not know those firmly rooted in knowledge</li>
<li>follow leaders who follow the footsteps of their killers.</li>
<li>were/are misguided by stupid or crooked religious leaders + of <a href="http://www.islamicboard.com/comparative-religion/38200-translation-quran-important-2.html">Islamic websites</a>?!</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope <a href="http://29letters.wordpress.com/2007/01/15/arabic-calligraphy-written-by-hand-or-type-set-on-the-computer/">Thomas Milo</a> will put an end to that?! 
Just have a look at the red sign opposite the re-type link?!</p>

in it seems to have words and blank spaces just like English.</em></p>
<p>The spaces are dividing phrases, not words. Thai words are not visually distinguished: you have to know the language in order to be able to determine where one word ends and another begins within a phrase. So, for example, this</p>
<p>ผมไปสักห้าวัน</p>
<p>in text might look like one word to a non-Thai reader, but it is actually five words</p>
<p>phǒm pay sàk hâa wan</p>
<p>which form a phrase meaning &lsquo;I am going for about five days&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I looked at the examples - I find the one of Moby Dick is far harder to read than the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; way of presenting text. It&rsquo;s down to the context I think. Prose is written to &lsquo;flow&rsquo;, whereas informational text or advertising messages are punchier and benefit from being broken into semantic chunks.</p>
<p>Mind, it could just be me. I really detest poetry for all the damn line breaks: I find my eyes jumping around hunting for the next line (and missing) and it really spoils my comprehension of the piece.</p>

No matter how logical an improvement they may appear to be over complex, evolved conventions, there are always cultural impediments to implementing reforms, most immovable the fact that there are so many stakeholders to get on side.</p>
<p>So this kind of idea may stand its best chance of getting established if it&rsquo;s introduced with a widespread new technology. A genre of e-books seems like a good proving ground.</p>
<p>Or through a pervasive corporate presence like Microsoft &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t LiveInk be a comparable exercise to Microsoft&rsquo;s productization of &ldquo;readability&rdquo; in the ClearType fonts/technology?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I regularly use this approach to setting type. I like the idea of breaking a sentence into its constituent phrases, and I feel the message in such a setting is easier to grasp by the reader. I started looking for natural breaks in sentences when setting introductory (usually centered) type. I then moved to asymmetrical settings because of my dislike for centered type.</p>
<p>The example below is taken from a client&rsquo;s 1997 annual report. The bodycopy (ITC Officina Sans) is set justified on two columns. The asymmetrical type treatment shown was used to introduce each of six sections throughout the book (always on a right-hand page).</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Text1_6701.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>(I apologize for the use of Trajan)</p>
<p>I would never consider setting an entire book with this asymmetrical treatment. But I feel it offers a good counterpoint to more regular body settings. It doesn&rsquo;t need to look like poetry or haiku. That can be controlled by the typesetter.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a more recent example (using TheMix):</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Text2_6134.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>It all comes down to care and attention to detail. Utilizing natural line breaks, checking line endings, adjusting the rag when necessary, identifying and removing rivers&hellip;that&rsquo;s all part of being a good typesetter.</p>
<p>Still, I am completely opposed to having type set by an algorithm. The samples provided by LiveInk are rife with rivers.</p>
