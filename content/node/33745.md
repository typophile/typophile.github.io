  body: "I wish I had the budget to just choose whichever font I want to... based
    on the name, for example. I have actually done that.\r\n\r\nThe history thing
    - that's something I'm really into. If I'm working on a book that's grounded in
    a particular era it is important to me to either use a font that is clearly of
    that era, or consciously not to. In other words be aware of the font's history
    in relation to the project and not just choose something that looks good."

    and who also worked under Vignelli at the beginning of her career - she had nothing
    nice to say about his ideology. In appreciation, I gave her a Helveeta shirt.
