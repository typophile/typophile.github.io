body: "I am testing a kernig table I just built into my font and came across the following
  problem: \r\n\r\nCharacter spacing in InDesign on screen seems to correspond to
  the kerning I built into the font (at least when zoomed-in). When I export the file
  as a pdf and print from Acrobat, all is well... But when I print directly from InDesign,
  all kerning seems to disappear or get highly distorted. Any ideas what might cause
  this? [Just in case it matters, the kerning is RTL for Hebrew].\r\n\r\nOn a related
  topic, what do people here find to be the best way to proof fonts in text sizes?
  I see discernable diferences in the appearance (overall darkness) of the same font
  printed on the same 1200 dpi laser when I switch from .otf to .ttf formats, and
  InDesign vs Acrobat (in addition to the specific kerning issue I am having now).
  Short of doing press-proofs, what is the best proofing workflow?"

    driver. Do you have any other printers to which you can print? Can you print to
    a PDF instead of using InDesign's export feature?\r\n\r\nAre you using a kern
    table for kerning, or OpenType GPOS kerning?"

    Xerox) and the sorry results were the same. :(\r\nI am using OpenType GPOS for
    kerning."
