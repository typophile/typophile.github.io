body: "I'm working on a file with this font but it's name is in an oriental glyph.
  The files provided call this \"AdobeMyungjoStd-Medium\" but it is not translating
  well and creating problems.\r\n\r\nCan anyone id this as font with english letters?
  Or give me a hint on where else I might need to look? I've never come across this
  problem before.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKeith"
