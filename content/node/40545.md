body: Helvetica sub heads with Garamond body copy. This debate is getting pretty heated
  in our studio. I personally feel they work well together or are the aesthetics of
  each too different to work in harmony?

  body: ">work in harmony\r\nBoth (btw. which of those Garamonds?) differ in x-height,
    construction principles of the glyphs, dynamic vs. static appearance, etc. To
    prove that try to put them together in one line of text and look at the result
    \u2013 it doesn't feel right in my opinion. But if there is enough space between
    them, difference in size and weight, etc. then the combination could work.\r\n\r\n "

    a matter of taste. If you like it, then use it :-)

    aesthetics and to get the intended feel you need to mix a proper pair. And, of
    course, some combinations do not work, and some work only in certain contexts."
