  and/or license fields in your OpenType fonts?\r\n\r\nWe're investigating a new bug
  that limits these fields to 5,000 characters (edit: regardless of encoding). Need
  to determine if this limit is unrealistic.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

    batch in the UFM files). Especially for NameID 10, but also for NameID 13 a limit
    of 5000 characters seems far from problematic to me; for instance our license
    description is currently 909 characters long.\r\n"

    750. Font Description fields vary considerably in length but I'd have to imagine
    we're still well under 5000.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: is it 5000 *characters*

  body: I've put the full EULA in some of my recent fonts, but I'm having second thoughts
    because of the issue of web fonts. Including the entire EULA can add a substantial
    amount to the file size. I'm thinking a link might be more practical.

  body: "In our case the description is just an abstract referring to the EULA that
    came with the font and especially pointing out that the user should have read
    the license and agrees with its content. Personally I think this is somewhat more
    useful than only a link or a very lengthy text when font info shows up, like for
    instance in Font Book.\r\n"

  body: "The SIL Open Font License is around 4600 chars, so is probably safe. We do
    expect people to put the full OFL license in their fonts. It seems to me that
    having the complete 'rules of use' (EULA) in the font itself would increase the
    chances that users actually follow them. And that would be a good thing, right?\r\n\r\nThere
    is already a license URL field that gives a link to an external EULA, so the main
    license field seems like it should be used for that purpose - to show the complete
    license. Although it does not affect OFL-licensed fonts, you probably need to
    fix the bug, or potentially face a vendor who wants to have their full EULA in
    the font (which should be their right) and can't, and accusing MS of not giving
    them the right to properly communicate their EULA. :-)\r\n\r\nVictor"
