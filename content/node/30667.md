  some years ago using\r\nKoch-Fraktur for the headline:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4752.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  the meanwhile I cannot see it any more: too much black,\r\ntoo heavy. So I decided
  with support from a young designer\r\nto organize a relaunch of my website (starting
  soon) with\r\nnew logos and new screen font (Georgia).\r\n\r\nThis is the new logo.
  Please let me know what you are\r\nthinking about it. To see what I am showing and
  offering\r\nits easier (for me) to ask you to visit my website 'cause\r\nmy english
  is too poor, alright?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_web_3844.jpg]\r\n\r\nApprox.
  40 percent of my sales are going to letterpress printers\r\nout of Germany (UK,
  Italy, Luxembourg, US). And I am dealer of\r\n(still existing) Stempel and Bauer.
  So I wanted to show a smell\r\nof \"historic touch out of the 20ies\", but without
  sentimentals.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your critique.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    do without the vertical line dividing the flag and the type. Generally a great
    improvement, as it doesn't imply that museal touch. Will be intersting to see
    if your customers will accept your new Id.\r\n\r\np.s. you're pretty lucky that
    the prussian flag is b/w only ;-)\r\np.p.s. make sure you use lead Futura (in
    the appropriate size, naturally)!"

    by their left alignment and thus don't need any line there. Why add something
    that's already there?

    mean.\r\nBut I love borders. Not only in typographic designs, but although in
    my life. This is what (for me personal) is \"Preu\xDFen\". Its like our flagg.
    Its black and white - true or lie, yes or no, good or bad. Everything what \xEDs
    damaged in our 'modern' times. But life is not fun, its duty. And the satisfaction
    at the end is to have done his damned duty. And to give it to the next generation
    of cours. (very old-fashioned? So what?)\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of the building
    the PBM will move to within the next three months:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bagel_2_3912.jpg]\r\n\r\nIts
    an old paper factory nearby.\r\nI talk to the owner, Mr Bagel. And (it was like
    a realization of the Matrix movie) he got his education for typesetter at the
    same printer I got - but 20 years before. The PBM fits 100 percent to this building.
    Its the same style: 90\xB0 angels, no curves. Its like coming home.\r\n\r\nI need
    the lines as borders for protection.\r\nOh yes, I do.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "On the logo: Futura Caps are stronger than the lower case, so I think having
    the name of your company in all caps will look better. This may require the rest
    to be smaller, but that I doubt that that will be a problem. \r\n\r\nOn the lines:
    I agree with Franz that the rules don't work well here. They don't seem to have
    a functional purpose, and they also don't add to the visual balance, but detract
    from it. If you want rules in the design, I think another layout will be needed.
    \r\n\r\nI would also think about a design that balances the weight of the black
    and white flag in the type layout. \r\n\r\nOh I just checked some of the designs
    of Tschichold. Your assymetric clean sans layout is of the spirit of Tschichold
    in his modernist phase. There he didn't use a rule like this, and perhaps it is
    out of place in this style of design. He does have designs with a thick rule to
    the *right* of a right ragged column of information.\r\n\r\nYou could experiment
    with that here by killing the rule at the top and putting a strong rule to the
    right of the information column, in  the business card. Here the idea would be
    to balance the flag at the top left assymetrically with the rule at the bottom
    right... \r\n\r\n[edit: just read Tim's comment. That is another way to go. in
    any case, I think this needs further experimentation to really get it balanced.]

    historicaly Preu\xDFen used the eagle more after 1871, after it became responsible
    for the whole \"Deutsches Reich\" and showed the pruss flagg with the crown of
    Wilhelm II. But he escaped to the Netherlands in 1918 - ah.. bah.. I do not believe
    in monarchy.\r\nPreu\xDFen is much more than this. Its a lifestyle from the innerheart.\r\nSo
    I decided to skip that eagle going back to the roots - black and white.\r\n\r\nIts
    although in the \"Preu\xDFen Hymne\" \"I am a Pruss do you know my colours?\":

    better without the bar. You can still be Prussian without it, and you know that
    ;-)\r\n\r\nI miss the Koch Fraktur, though. Your new design is simpler, and better.
    And the flag is better than any eagle you could ever get. But my heart beats for
    Koch's letters. Futura is a great typeface, but it is not warm. I would not spend
    a night with her."

    any more for the buttons (But english translations for the lyers :-)\r\nI hate
    the (mostly wrong, wrong, wrong) use of anglizisms in my german language. And
    someone like you, living in Germany and knowing both languages, should write an
    article here about the funny german-english slogans and words, lots of german
    companies in the past tried to give themselves a kind of 'international image'.\r\n\r\nMy
    Online-Shop will be a 'Magazin'.\r\nMy email button will show 'ePost'\r\n\r\nThe
    whole site will be black on white - like the flagg.\r\nAll buttons will appear
    in Futura Buch. All text will be in Georgia.\r\nI love it.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, Monday,
    is the day of decision if I get the new rooms I want to move to with the PBM.
    If I get it - and it looks nice - I'll integrate pictures of the Bagel paper manufacturer.
    If they agree, I'll move end of February. Does any one want to help? Free drinks
    included? Just approx. 11,000 kg lead to move? Great, thank you very much, I understand
    :-) \r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
