  of the Salvation Army.\r\nYour task is to design a T-shirt that could be sold online
  to promote the work of the Salvation Army. You will need to capture the essence
  of the Salvation Army, whilst still showcasing your creativity and artistic flair.
  You will need to create an original approach using bold colours and graphics within
  your T-shirt design that is suited to both men and women .\r\nOut of the box thinking
  is greatly encouraged. Let your creativity run free to explore techniques and imagery,
  but still keep the Salvation Army purpose in mind. The design must be bold and eye-catching
  and inspired by your knowledge of the Salvation Army..  The T-shirt needs to be
  creatively branded, taking in contemporary style and trend. As part of the solution
  you are to research and brainstorm what the Salvation Army means to you and come
  up with a clever catch phrase and design on what you want the T-shirt to say and
  mean. The words \u201CHOPE\u201D and \u201CCOMPASSION\u201D come to mind but are
  only a guide. You can also refer to their vision statement.\r\nYour design must
  include one image. It can be a photograph or illustration that has been taken or
  designed by you. The final design must be created in the Adobe Suite. Any hand drawn
  images will need to be traced or scanned and imported into Illustrator. Images can
  be enhanced with Photoshop.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this particular design that I created
  using Adobe Photoshop consists of nine layers. Three images have been used \u2013
  to set them apart, the male shirt has a photo of founder William Booth and the female
  shirt has a photo of founder Catherine Booth, the Salvation Army logo itself and
  the famous peaked cap you often see a Salvo Officer wearing. The remainder of the
  design is made up of two typefaces \u2013 Copperplate Gothic Bold for \u20181865\u2019
  and Edwardian Script for \u2018est. & secure your freedom\u2019.\r\nI believe this
  design is not your typical supporter shirt consisting of simply a logo and a slogan,
  it is fashionable which would lead to more people wearing it. It is also up to date
  with today\u2019s trends in that it contains large bold type, it has actual photographs
  rather than drawn images and the opacity of \u20181865\u2019 has been lessened to
  reveal an underlying image adding it\u2019s individuality as a supporters shirt.
  \r\nThe reasoning behind this design is to convey to the audience how long The Salvation
  Army have been operating. The human eye is drawn to the Salvation Army logo first
  as it is the only image that contains colour, which tells the viewer straight away
  what the design is about. \u20181865\u2019 comes into view next which for most people
  describes a particular year as it is a four digit number. Whilst reading \u20181865\u2019
  the viewer can then notice that there is an image in the background which shows
  that that particular person is possibly \u2018behind\u2019 this highly-regarded
  organization. Moving on the viewer will read the slogan \u2018secure your freedom\u2019
  which was chosen due to its similarity with The Salvation Army\u2019s actual slogan
  \u2018we\u2019re about people finding freedom\u2019.  \r\nOverall this shirt is
  sending a very powerful message, The Salvation Army have been assisting others less
  fortunate then themselves for years and that they\u2019re here to stay. It also
  promotes their strength, loyalty and reliability. \r\n\r\nAny feedback would be
  greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
