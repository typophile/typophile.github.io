  business card that I'm designing for friends of mine. They do seminars on developing
  communication skills and helping people with their public speaking skills. They
  are both professional dancers/singers/actors/performers. I was wondering if you
  could give me some feedback on:\r\n\r\n- fonts chosen\r\n- the layout\r\n- the weights
  and balance of the overall card\r\n- Some ideas on what can be done to the back
  of the card\r\n- anything else that stands out.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!"

    my opinion. I would use one (two at most) and use size/weight/colour to develop
    your hierarchy of info.\r\n> <em>the layout</em>\r\nKeep it simple, these guys
    are experts in communication. It seems very cluttered.\r\n> <em>anything else
    that stands out</em>\r\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I cringe when I see photos
    of people on their business card and without wanting to sound cynical, the portrait
    is quite cheesy."

    body: "Thanks! I fixed the middle section font and used Medium Futura instead.
      I think it looks a little better too. Thank you very much for that comment!\r\n\r\nWhat
      suggestions do you recommend to make the card less cluttered? The card they
      gave me originally was way too busy and I'm in the process of trying to simplify
      it. Any suggestions to improve that would be awesome!\r\n\r\nThey think the
      photos are hot actually. Actually, many speakers put their pictures on their
      cards, because it is important to their business (World champion speakers and
      many professionals). If they didn't use their photo, what else would you recommend?\r\n\r\nIf
      they did develop some kind of a logo/mark, what do you think would be most appropriate?\r\n\r\nThanks
      again for the comments! I really appreciate the feedback."

  body: Lots of real estate brokers want their portraits all over everything too.
    Majorly cringeworthy! The only people who should have headshots on their business
    cards are performers and prostitutes, IMHO.

  body: "My recommendations:\r\n\r\n-Right align the ampersand and shift over the
    upper name to match the rest of the text. \r\n-Set the phone number in standard
    (123)456-7890 format that's used in the USA. While I personally prefer the dotted
    format, in a warm-fuzzies-and-photos card like this the dotted format might come
    off as pretentious.\r\n-Drop the underline on the back. Bold is enough.\r\n-Set
    the name on the back the same way that it was done on the front, and put the phrase
    \u201CImprove Your\u201D in bold so that it reads as a phrase followed by a list
    of terms."

    of consumers. Certain things make people lower their guard: families, puppies,
    religion, patriotism and smiley pictures (Which is why they all show up in congressional
    campaign commercials). If I worked in a field where a big smiley photo on my card
    made me more money, I'd have them regardless of how silly it looked.\r\n\r\nNice
    update on the back of the card. If you're going to do anything else, why not just
    lose the extra logo and just go with the four lines of text? It's the sort of
    oddly compelling thing that might encourage someone to flip it over and see if
    the other side explains how to Improve Your...."

  body: "What's with all that unbroken volume of blue? And the volume of blue on the
    left pushes, forces, and unbalances the elements of type - pushing them almost
    right off the card. And try not to lead the eye to bottom right - it ends downward,
    and hence has a negative connotation.\r\n\r\nNuke the other side completely, thx.
    The image of those two crudely cropped figures are all about gradients (gradients
    of light and shadow, gradients of colour and form, etc.), which is in direct contrast
    to flat (non-gradient) areas of colour (white background) and type, hence the
    disconnect and drastic design disassociation.\r\n\r\nThe whole design seems forced
    and awkward. Come up with a fluid concept - and run with that. The current design
    seems to be just an assemblage of technical needs with a complete disregard to
    an overall theme or design.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sure you don't want me to talk about
    why that is... \r\n\r\n__________\r\nHiro\r\n"
