body: I have to do a bookmark design with a hilariously large quantity of text. What's
  your favourite condensed serif that works in like 6.5 to 8-pt sizes? (All my fave
  small condensed fonts are sans, and all the good condensed serifs are better in
  12-14-pt and up, usually...)

  body: "An example of illogical truth: condensed and small size tend to not go together.
    Type usually get wider, x-height larger and ascender/descender shorter as they
    get smaller. I don't know of any condensed serifs for small size. Not sure what
    kind of a type budget you have, but Garamond Premier Pro \"Caption\" is a small
    size option that you may already have. Also free - but in beta so watch the kerning,
    SerifBeta6 from Betatype.com (I just used this to decent effect).\r\n\r\nNewspaper
    types may also suit your needs.\r\n\r\nCross post edit: Minion Condensed Caption
    -- Ok, I now know of one. I wonder if this was an exercise in completeness for
    the minion family, or if it's useful. I'll have to take a look. Thanks Stephen."

  body: Interesting. Serif Beta's not a million miles off Excelsior, an old newspaper
    font I was considering for this. But I've cooked up an insane mash of Constructa
    with gothic drop caps off Dafont...

    by Gerard Unger? He seems to focus on making his newsprint fonts especially space-saving
    (while remaining readable).\r\nBut I agree the thread title sounds a bit scary.

    additions.<cite>\r\n\r\nStephen, nice start. You could add Z\xF3calo Text to the
    Modern Alternatives list. (Or did that not go out to Vendors yet?)\r\n\r\nZ\xF3calo
    would probably not be suited to Kate's initial request -- too wide. But it seems
    that many of the newspaper text suggestions are veering away from the narrow criteria.\r\n\r\nI
    was working on something in that same classic Corona/Excelsior/Plantin vein, but
    actually on the narrower side and with a touch more Baroque flavor. But not really
    ready for primetime, unfortunately. \r\n\r\nWhat about Nikola Djurek's [[http://www.typonine.com/fonts/brioni/|Brioni]]?
    -- on the narrower side and I bet it would handle nicely small. Come to think
    of it, his [[http://www.typonine.com/fonts/tempera-biblio/|Tempera Biblio]] might
    also fit the bill.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."
