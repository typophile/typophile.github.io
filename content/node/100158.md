body: I'm trying to identify this typeface. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  I'm also looking for similar serif typefaces that are missing strokes or have similar
  gaps within the characters. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2013-01-29

    Font Cluster: Stencil Serif/Slab Serif Fonts]] could be helpful.\r\nNone of them
    are actually close. They share only \"serif+stencil\" specifications. Dala Floda
    is an original design and deserve its price.\r\nAnyway, here's a selection: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/applyinteractive/caslon-fina-stencil/|Caslon

  body: I agree that Floda is worth the price. It's a beautiful typeface, but I was
    just curious what else was out there. Thanks for your help.

    is so similar to Dala Floda and Galliard that we\u2019ve not included it in <a
