  body: ITC Plaza Ultra, except for the /S; that appears to be another font that has
    been condensed to sort of match the weight/look of the rest of the characters.
    Anyone buying the font needs to be aware that it is available from several vendors
    and not all the vendors have the same character set, thus might be missing some
    alternates.
