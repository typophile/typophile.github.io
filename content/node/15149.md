    body: "No, I would not compare it to Font Labs hinting ability, it is a different
      kettle of fish.\r\n\r\n\"In FontLab we use a small set of high-level hinting
      instructions that are automatically compiled to TrueType instructions during
      font export. Because these instructions can be set and edited visually we call
      them visual TrueType hints or just visual hints.\"\r\n\r\nTTHmachine (the cuurent
      version) is a tool for applying low-level instructions to fonts, it also has
      visual rendering to help in this process. \r\n\r\nThe aim is to add (in later
      versions) a higher-level hinting ability also (that could be compared to font-lab,
      I guess).\r\n"
