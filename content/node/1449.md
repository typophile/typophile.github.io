  body: I rather enjoyed Gerry Leonidas&#39; talk, John Hudson&#39;s new Hebrew face,
    Gerald Cinamon&#39;s Koch slides &#40;lots of stuff not in the book&#41;, the
    House of Downer demo, everything really. I only regret not being able to be in
    three places at once for some of those presentations. I really wanted to see more.
    That&#39;s probably the best complaint they can get. <BR> <BR>The food, well...
    I guess I understand now why I&#39;ve never heard of one going out to a Canadian
    restaurant. I preferred Leipzig. If I weren&#39;t allergic to seafood, I might
    have enjoyed the food more. <BR> <BR>So now that it&#39;s Monday, check out the
    announcement from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>.

    was complaining &#40;as is my wont&#41; of the stale state of typography in mass
    market magazines available at airports, but mentioned that there was one exception,
    but I couldn&#39;t remember the magazine name or identify the headline font, so
    I drew him a couple of characters. &#34;Oh, was that Natural Health?&#34; says
    Cyrus, &#34;That&#39;s the first issue and a new face I just designed.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>6. Best quote? &#34;The choice of type is based on reputation and trends,

    type luminaries in my home town. <BR> <BR>Taking Dan Carr and paul Razell to the
    Ho Sun Hing Printing Co, type foundry for a tour and demo of Chinese type casting
    was also a pleasure. <BR> <BR>It was not easy to get Fontlab information from
    the young men doing the digital work on the typeface during John Downer&#39;s
    Font Sprint, but I realize they were busy trying to drain the swamp. &#40;Fontlab
    does look like a hell of a program&#41; <BR> <BR>John Downer&#39;s signwriting
    ability just floored me. Such a talent! And  very nice guy as well. <BR> <BR>And
    to top it off, I always enjoy hanging around the False Creek waterway. <BR> <BR>The
    disappointing part is that I managed to meet very few type designers, and would
    have liked to have had the time to get peole to visit my own metal foundry. <BR>

  body: PowerPoint is actually a great program to write and put together a presentation
    as a structured document. It&#39;s how people use it that makes it a bad thing.
    The slide sorter view is really good, as well as the outline mode. InDesign doesn&#39;t
    compare when it comes to this. Try organizing your pages in the pages palette.
    It&#39;s a nightmere. <BR> <BR>Though I still do my presentations in InDesign
    and present in Acrobat. That&#39;s what I did for mine at ATypI. Can&#39;t do
    without the typographic sophistication. No kerning? Forget it! I&#39;m tempted
    to try Keynote. Would any of you recomment it? I&#39;ve noticed a few presenters
    used Keynote. I love the cinematic cross-dissolve!

    However, if you have Acrobat 6 Pro, you can export PDF from PowerPoint and have
    it even map transitions to their closest PDF equivalents. I haven&#39;t played
    with this much, since I think fancy transitions are often a distraction, so I
    can&#39;t say how well it works. <BR> <BR>Keith: <BR>I agree wholeheartedly that
    PowerPoint is great for managing structured presentations. That&#39;s why I still
    use it even though the typography sucks so badly. However, when time allows I
    do the initial version in PowerPoint and then redo it all in InDesign when I&#39;m
