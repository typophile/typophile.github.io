  detergent (soap) and other P&G style products. Lots of gradients etc...\r\n\r\nAny
  input welcome ... \r\n\r\nThanks"

    in a vector app. such as freehand or illustrator\r\n(you can create 3d boxes and
    custom gradients fairly easy)\r\n* use photoshop for final touchups\r\n\r\ndo
    you have specific requirements or ..."

    a product is almost silly. By the time the designer gets the project they are
    painted into a very small corner. \r\n\r\nIf this is a students project then just
    take a package open it carefully and use it as a template for where to place graphic
    elements. Last point gradients don't make a product good or bad. Some of the best
    packages on the market today are toothpaste and they are using metalic based papers
    and printing on them. Its a process you'd be hard to copy using a computer."

  body: Define the scope of the design needs. Find out about the printing to be used,
    everything including the shipping carton that the detergent is transported in
    will need art. Whatever is designed needs to translate well to these low end methods
    and work as a system. Also be sensitive to the costs over time. With large production
    runs special materials and methods can become expensive. Try to get an idea about
    every product to be included in the line. How will your detergent box art look
    when sized down to fit the small boxes at a coin laundry? And on small sample
    bottles? Or a coupon? Can it be rendered flexo, which can't produce a screen lighter
    than 10%.

  body: "Thanks for the input. Not for a student project, mainly to build up my portf.
    some. Cinci is a big packaging town. Thought I'd do some. So, \r\n\r\nDan, I only
    mention gradients because, everyone I go to school with refuses to use them, no
    matter what. Which is a bit ignorant in my view. Given packaging, you almost always
    use some kind. I have an affinity for gradations *not abusive,* as they are a
    naturally occuring phenomenon,\r\n\r\nBTW ... I'm thinking of a bit of a parody
    package. Das Boot branded saltwater clothing detergent? Do you think any employers
    could appriciate the humor? Or should it be serious?"

    I think what you should do is know the underlying process of how a product comes
    to market so when you get to talk to a design firm that does product design you
    will come across as informed. '

    you suggest, do these people that do tide really sit back and say, what kind of
    gradient do consumers need? or prefer?

    have the latter without the former, and the former is (for the most part) all
    about market research.\r\n\r\nYou don't mean to imply that companies create items
    that people need and then wrap them in attractive packages, do you?\r\n\r\nIt's
    pretty much always been more about grinding out enough research to best devise
    how to convince a bunch of people to buy something they don't want or need. You're
    not dressing up an object, nor selling what's inside, you're selling an idea,
    regardless of how asinine or useless the item or idea might be.\r\n\r\nSo, you
    identify the market of people who think they need over-priced coffee products,
    then nail down their weaknesses, then determine the best visual attack to play
    on their insecurities, then smack them over the head with the right colours, shapes
    and fonts. Next thing you know, they're beating each other senseless to get to
    the check-out first.\r\n\r\n[Jeez, looks like I need some beautifully-packaged,
    over-priced coffee to take the edge off this afternoon. Phew.]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Eric, I doubt my post had any influence, but I do hope I didn't cause too
    much discouragement with my anti-consumer rant. I read last year (or so) about
    the designer's manifesto (I can't remember the specifics, I'm sure someone here
    can point us in the right direciton) and the debate around it. To me, anyway,
    it was basically an attempt to reconcile the creative and technical side of what
    we do with the rather ugly and hucksteristic side of the game. The problem is,
    there is no reconciling it, really. In order to do what we love to do, and to
    pay the bills, we pretty much have to sell garbage for billionaires and billionaire-wanna-be's.
    And, occassionally, good folks wanting to do something decent; the bug here is
    that the latter are usually pro-bono clients, and that's fine, great even, but
    it doesn't pay the bills.\r\n\r\nI think what the folks here have been stressing
    is that it's hard to present a mock-up packaging sample because clients like P&G
    don't care if you're a good designer, only if you can sell what they're shucking
    out, and it would be really hard to present an impressive example of this sort
    of work without all the research to begin with.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you CAN come
    up with such an example, you'll make a big impression."

  body: "Eric,\r\n\r\nCincinnati is indeed one of the most packaging centric design
    communities in the country. It is heartening to know that young designers are
    considering \u201Cpackage design\u201D as a career choice. Unfortunately, there
    are no programs in the area that focus on the specifics of package design as it
    relates to the actual practice of packaging as an integral component of a MCG\u2019s
    marketing budget. That said, it is important to realize that most portfolios new
    graduates interview with have \u201Cno\u201D packaging examples in them.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I interview candidates, I look for strong type, color and composition skills.
    You need have competent software skills. Most PKG design firms in Cincinnati are
    going to require that you know Illustrator and Photoshop inside and out. Other
    software is a bonus. Package design is a unique practice in that \u201Cyour style\u201D
    is much less important than your ability to design to a particular target consumer
    set. Bold type and colors for laundry vs. sophisticated, quieter solutions for
    beauty care. Personality is a key component that is reviewed as well. Most firms
    have large teams that work on a range of projects over the course of a week. Deadlines
    are tight and demands put a lot of pressure on team members. I always look for
    some I think will work well within a team environment.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry
    about creating comps etc. Strong design skills, dedication to craft and a team
    oriented personality will be enough to land you an entry level job \u2013 regardless
    of where you went to school.\r\n\r\nPackage design firms in town to consider are:\r\nFisher
    Design\r\nLandor\r\nLAGA\r\nLPK\r\nDeskey\r\nInterbrand\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Analyzer.jpg]"
