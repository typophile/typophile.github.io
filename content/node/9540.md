  with a handwritten font that I would like to have identified.  I have attached an
  image with 2 samples.  Others can be found at CBS.com. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the assistance.

  body: Mike, as a true foodie, I have never told you how much I appreciate your word
    choices for your samples. I even know what Uppuma and Quinoa are. Xergis and Ishtu
    are the only ones I&#39;m not familiar with, can you enlighten me?

  body: Ishtu, as I recall, means what it sounds like &#40;almost&#41; -- it is a
    stew, but I don&#39;t recall the language &#40;Hindi?&#41;. Xergis escapes me,
    but I found all of these in books I had around the kitchen.  I used foods and
    spices, because I thought everyone could relate to them.  <BR> <BR>They were also
    chosen to use every lower case letter at least twice, at the same time that each
    upper case letter was used for the 26 words. <BR> <BR>I will see if I can find
    the references again, or get a definition for those two.

  body: Do you do Acrostic puzzles? I bet you&#39;d be good at them.

  body: Well, yes. I used to love doing them, but it&#39;s been a couple of years.
    I have a book of them around somewhere.  Acrostics, not crosswords.  <BR> <BR>
    Why do you think that?

  body: Acrostics are much more satisfying than crosswords. I thought that because
    of the way you explained your system for word choices.

  body: Interesting deduction. <BR> <BR>I found &#39;Xergis&#39;. It was in the index
    of &#39;The New Laurel&#39;s Kitchen&#39; by Laurel Robertson, et al. It seems
    Xergis is a cold soup made with cucumbers, scallions and yogurt, with some spices.
    She says it is a &#39;Levantine beverage&#39;, so that tells me it comes from
    the the Eastern Mediterranean &#40;Turkey, Syria, Lebanon &amp; Israel&#41; <BR>
    <BR>The same book also had Ishtu. It&#39;s a &#39;South Indian dish that is almost
    a sauce&#39; that is served over rice. I also found a dish &#40;on the web&#41;
    called Kozi Ishtu that was translated as Chicken Stew -- that&#39;s where I got
    the stew idea. <BR> <BR>Boy, do we digress, or what??
