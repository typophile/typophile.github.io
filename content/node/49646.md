  body: 'Yes, luckyhole, that''s what I thought, too. I wonder if Euripides associated
    feminine with "soft", for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae'

  body: "re: luckyhole\r\n\r\nwhy the cynicism? surely that's valid methodology for
    typography?\r\ninfact good typography is appropriate. you wouldnt use 'UltraBlackSlabs'
    to convey something fragile (unless you were aiming for irony)\r\n\r\nwas it a
    stupid request? "

  body: "@oldelpaso \u2014 Glad I could help. :^)\r\n\r\n@others \u2014 Let's just
    not have that discussion. I think we can all agree that we see type differently
    just as we see genders differently. "
