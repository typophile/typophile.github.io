body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a simple, honest and approachable san serif
  for use in body text.  My idea is to have a journal feel but without being too themey.
  Something with the characteristics above that come together looking elegant. I loved
  the feeling of Frutiger on my page ( one of my faves) and although quite neutral
  \ it's the complete opposite of what I want, its cold and distant and not really
  in line with the honest feel i'd like to convey.\r\n\r\nI like Myriad Pro but wanted
  to see if there are others you can recommend, perhaps something I am simply not
  finding. Any recommendations would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Thanks guys! I do like Ideal Sans, esp the g's.  It's incredibly versatile
    with all the different weights and corresponding feel, each one has its own distint
    look however I'm not looking to purchase anything new ( sorry should have mentioned
    that before). I think I'm warming up to Myriad Pro, is that a bad thing? I wanted
    to try something new but similar but can't seem to find anything suitable in my
    library. Argh!

  body: "Axia is a beaut! Definately want to try it out soon. Perfect for architecture
    related projects! Thank you! \r\n\r\nStill need to find the perfect type for this
    coming brochure tho. Going through my library again and like the idea of mixing
    myriad pro ( headers) and minion pro ( bodytext)\r\n\r\nI like the classical elegance
    of minion pro and think it works well for the length body text but like the idea
    of juxtaposing it with sans serif like myriad pro, still has that humanist feel,
    humble and quietly confident. \r\n\r\nThoughts of other pairings with a similar
    feel are welcome :)"

  body: "Given the fact Minion was born as a sister to Myriad, the two typefaces work
    very well together. I believe they share the same x-height and roughly the same
    width, although that can be modified with Multiple Master. I think Myriad and
    Minion were the first Multiple Master fonts released by Adobe in the mid nineties.\r\n\r\nMyriad
    has a great level of legibility, but it is used in Apple\u2019s advertising and
    therefore I think a lot of people associate it with the Apple brand."

  body: Yes the only thing that is dissuading me from using it is the association
    with the Apple Brand... but they do work very well together. It's looking very
    elegant. I also tried Gill Sans with Optima. I may use pairs or a single typeface,
    I shall see what works best. I am kind of restricted as I have to find complimentary
    arabic typefaces and given the lack of variety I can't be too experimental with
    the english.
