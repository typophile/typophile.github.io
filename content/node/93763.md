  Graphic Design student from New Zealand, and am a Masters Candidate at the Whanganui
  School of Design.\r\n\r\nMy dissertation looks into the current \"state\" of type
  work, both in terms of typography and typeface design. My primary focus is the mechanization/digitization
  of type work: the influence that mass-production and distribution principles have
  on both the value of a piece of work, and the extent to which its meaning can be
  read.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm fascinated with how these values relate to the origins
  of our language- ie. the spoken word and conversation. As cultural participants,
  we are bombarded with short, sharp digital messages. Books are read on mobile devices,
  newspapers presented on tablets. Digital media creates an illusion of productivity:
  the click-snap instant transfer of image and text interferes with our perception
  of conversation. Why write when you can email? Why call when you can text? The instantaneous,
  pixel-based nature of modern communication is at odds with thousands of years of
  evolution.\r\n\r\nThe precise Bezier curves and 1200dpi digital printing of our
  visual language bear no semblance to the gestural, cursive origins of our written
  language. The pixel is so far removed from our spoken language that it no longer
  bears any symbolic reference to the intended phrase, leaving majority of tone and
  voice up to the interpretation of the recipient.\r\n\r\nAs a paper, it will investigate
  the influence of speed: of production and of delivery. It will entertain traditional
  notions of craft with respect for the influence that technology has on type work,
  and will propose a synthesis between digital type practices and traditional craftsmanship,
  in order to restore the conversation within our type work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where
  are we headed? How many Garamond revivals do we need? Can the pixel carry any cues
  as to the voice of a piece of type- or does a physically crafted work achieve a
  better result?</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm not asking for anyone to do anything for me,
  simply challenge my way of thinking- and hopefully I can do the same for you. Thank
  you in advance for your participation!"

    and \"restoring the conversation within our type work\" does not require a \"synthesis
    between digital type practices and traditional craftsmanship\", it requires what
    it always has: a forward-looking synthesis between function and self-expression.
    For example in the sphere of typeface design the breaking of the link with handwritten
    letterforms is not a bug, it's a feature - because it allows for both better functionality
    and more freedom of expression. Interestingly this even applied to the hand-made
    metal types of yesteryear.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Haha yes, very true.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a question of appropriateness:
    I agree entirely with the notion of functionality and freedom of expression- but
    to what end? I guess my point is that it isn't possible to encode traditional
    vocal cues in purely screen-based type: it's a sign of a sign, if you will.\r\n\r\nI
    mean obviously, type is about communication, and creating a voice in type work.
    We seem to have explored this whole screen type thing, and, alone, it is not an
    appropriate way to present a conversation. Sure, we're going to get higher resolution
    screens and the correspondingly-designed versions of Arial/Times, but isn't this
    a pointless exercise?\r\n\r\nI'd say I'm trying to synthesize a more appropriate
    system of conversation through type work, taking into consideration technological
    developments as well as traditional practice.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks, I really appreciate
    your participation!"
