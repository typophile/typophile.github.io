  body: "InDesign doesn't support this directly, so you have to work around that.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want an entire paragraph boxed, cut the text and place it into a frame of
    its own. You can paste this frame back into its position inbetween the other text
    (note that it will <em>not</em> break at the end of a page), or place it on its
    own with text wrap applied. You can also create a table of 1 cell and 1 row, although
    the same page break restriction applies -- ID will not break a table row.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want several lines boxed inside an otherwise regular paragraph, create a character
    style with Underline and Strikethrough. Move the Underline position down and the
    Strikethrough up to good positions. This does not create vertical lines at the
    left and right positions; you can fake these by inserting a pipe \"|\" symbol,
    adjusting its thickness and height with the Vertical and Horizontal scaling and
    moving it up or down with Baseline shift. You might want to offset the following/preceding
    text with a hair or thin space (also with the underline/strikethru applied).\r\n\r\n[Added]
    It seems you may also be referring to \"inverse text\" :-) That's also possible;
    create a very thick Underline -- about the same as your leading --, and set the
    text color to \"Paper\"."
