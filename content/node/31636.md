body: "Hey all im trying to find a tutorial that can allow me to curve the baseline
  but leave the X-height alone kind of thing in Illustrator.  I feel that this should
  be pretty simple in illustrator, but its one of those things I have never had to
  do.  A link to a tutorial would rule.  I will make you coffee next time your jantzen
  beach.  Thanks Casey.\r\n\r\nI provided a link to show what Im talking about.  Mainly
  with \"Rose Festival\"."

  body: "Good mornin,\r\n\r\nI don't know about a tutorial, but may i suggest messing
    around with the envelope distort option in the object menu. You have the option
    to make with warp, or to make with mesh. The warp gives you some basic shapes
    that it'll distort to, which you can then mess with afterwards by using the white
    arrow to pull individual points on the mesh. However make sure you choose the
    colour of the text first as you'll be unable to do so afterwaards without expanding
    the object.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: Leslie Cabarga's book <cite>Logo, Font, and Lettering Bible</cite> has a whole
    slew of lessons on how to do this very thing in illustrator and look like a pro.
    The book is super, amazingly highly rated by me and others here on Typophile.
    Check it out.
