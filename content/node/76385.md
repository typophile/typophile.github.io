body: "I have the budget to buy a text font for a new art book project and looking
  for advice on a readable, modern sans. The subject is the art of the 20s but I am
  NOT looking for something overtly deco. On the other hand it should be appropriate
  and not too contemporary in feel. It should be simple, formal, classic and, as mentioned
  above, readable in small point sizes (notes, captions). The book has a lot of text.\r\n\r\nAmong
  the fonts I already have I'm considering Neutra, Seria Sans and Verlag, but those
  all have very small x-heights. I'm definitely open to suggestions and would love
  to work with a new font.\r\n\r\nOh and open type preferred. There will be fractions."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions, keep them coming! Lapidaria is lovely but I need
    a font with an italic. I'll take a closer look at Benton; I had considered News
    or Trade Gothic, or Akzidenz. 718 and Stainless are both too contemporary in feel
    and also too wide, I something more space-efficient.\r\n\r\nI like this font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/LEsprit-Nouveau-Purism-Paris-1918-1925/dp/0810967278\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/espritnouveau_6006.jpg]\r\n\r\nNot
    the display (Geometric 415) but the text font. Still waiting to see if it can
    be ID'd or if you all know something similar."

  body: I don't think so. The display type is (or Geometric, which is pretty much
    the same). But the text font doesn't match, look at the t, the y, the numerals,
    the itals.

  body: "URW Grotesk is only $99 for the family, that's a no-brainer. \r\n\r\nAlright
    Sans doesn't have great pricing options, $40 for individual weights/styles or
    $300 for the whole family, which has all sorts of bolds I'll never use. I wish
    they had smaller bundles, I just really want the lighter weights but would end
    up spending $300 just to get those."

  body: I guess they are interested in the threads, and this way they can easily track
    it to see new posts. URW Grotesk is quite an underestimated family, and the price
    is phenomenal. I already had it in my URW Typeworks collection, but did not use
    it till now. Seeing it like this it looks very good! There also is a companion
    serif called URW Antiqua.

    sans. I guess I was mislead by reading the information on the Linotype site, as
    Linotype obviously doesn''t own this design. Also Frutiger''s statement "Hermann
    ist nicht ein sans Mensch." And I was underwhelmed by his recent informal Palatino
    sans, and wrongly concluded that he hadn''t ever done a normal sans. But this
    has a lovely rhythm to it.  '
