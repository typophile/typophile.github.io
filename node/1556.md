body: Will Apple FontBook have a font auto-activation feature? I&#39;m planning to
  upgrade to Panther in the coming months and plan to use FontBook instead of Suitcase.
  If FontBook does have auto-activation is there any reason I would want to use Suitcase?

    happy about the Oct.24 release of Panther, and with it the release from servitude
    to crappy 3rd-party OS X font-management apps. &#40;ATM Deluxe, I pine for thee.
    &#42;sob&#42;&#41; <BR> <BR>Uh, what was the question? Oh yes... The nearest answer
    I could find was this: &#34;Font Book enables and disables fonts dynamically,
    allowing you to switch between different font sets without restarting applications.&#34;
    Granted, that&#39;s not necessarily auto-activation -- depends what they mean
    by &#34;dynamically.&#34; <BR> <BR>A recent post asked about font-previewing utilities
    for OS X. Looks like Font Book does have that feature: &#34;Double-clicking a
    font file &#40;or a group of them&#41; in the Finder opens a preview of the font,
    with the option to install it in just one click.&#34; <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a decent
    PDF showing the features of FontBook here: <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fontbook/"

  body: If you follow Suitcase&#39;s response to Apple&#39;s FontBook, of <BR>course
    you&#39;ll still need Suitcase. <BR> <BR>My initial take &#40;prediction&#41;
    is FontBook will negate the need  <BR>for regular users to have a font management
    app, but that <BR>people managing thousands of fonts will still benefit from  <BR>something
    like Suitcase. It really depends on how far Apple <BR>wants to take FontBook,
    but I&#39;m not expecting it to replace <BR>anything in its first release. <BR>
    <BR>That said, I think Suitcase, et al, have some catching up to  <BR>do in terms
    of ease of use and overall stability.

  body: I agree &#40;about 3rd-party font-mgmt apps needing to catch up&#41;. After
    sulking for a few months about the loss of ATM Deluxe, I bore down and test-drove
    Suitcase, Font Reserve, and Font Agent Pro. I didn&#39;t like any of them, but
    found Font Agent Pro the least bad of the bunch. Actually, it&#39;s pretty good,
    except that for some reason it makes Photoshop incredibly slow -- so much so that
    I never run the two at the same time, which is a major inconvenience. <BR> <BR>So
    I&#39;m really hoping Apple will give us something that&#39;s truly competitive
    with the other guys.

  body: Master Juggler is not bad. I&#39;ve tried them all, and it works for me. It
    supports Unicode, and they say they are planning an auto-activation feature in
    the next release. No demo though.

  body: Meredith, I was at an Adobe seminar yesterday and got a look at the Beta Adobe
    CS, but I degress. There was a represenative form Suitcase and he told me they
    bought Font Reserve and Font Reserve&#39;s president has joined Suitcase the goal
    is to take the best of both applications and roll it into one. So there is hope.

  body: QuarkXPress 6 does not support Unicode. <BR> <BR>In direct conversation, Juergen
    Kurz says that QuarkXPress 7 will support Unicode &#40;as well as OpenType layout
    features&#41;. He claims they&#39;re allocating 18 engineers for 9 months to add
    Unicode support, which seems like a plausible amount of work. <BR> <BR>&#40;Of
    course, among our applications, InDesign has been Unicode based since 1.0., Photoshop
    since 5.5 or so, and the about-to-ship Illustrator CS speaks Unicode as well.
    Current versions of Premiere and AfterEffects also have Unicode text engines.&#41;

    but do you really want to wait another 3 years before quark come out with unicode

  body: I wasn&#39;t suggesting anybody should wait for QuarkXPress 7 for anything.
    I just thought it was interesting news, and that people would want to know. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s an interesting question as to how long it will take them to get QXP
    7 to the market. They managed version 6 in 18 months &#40;standard for the industry,
    but lighting-fast for Quark&#41;. But they&#39;ve also just transitioned their
    development to India. they now have much less experienced but perhaps many more
    engineers to throw at the application. <BR> <BR>I have no idea how long it will
    take, but my guess is that the engineering changeover will significantly increase
    the bugs in the application.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, regardless, I am of course not
    encouraging anybody to wait. InDesign is a wonderful application and everyone
    should buy it.  <BR> The new CS version shows all the signs of an increasingly
    mature application, with increasing attention to workflow issues and performance
    as well as continuing to add innovative new features like nested styles. <BR>
    <BR>Of course, seeing as I work at Adobe, you may not expect me to be unbiased
    in this matter. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    as Font Book does many things that average users will appreciate,  and one thing

    a very functional  and robust product, as both approaches have their merits. And
    there are other  font managers around if you don&#39;t like that approach. But
    for auto-activation,  Font Book will not do the job.  <BR> <BR>Chuck Wege'

    can live without auto-activation &#40;like Jean, I prefer to know what&#39;s happening
    behind the scenes&#41;, but this report showed up this morning on <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/panreader.html#oct16"
    target="_blank">MacInTouch</a>: <BR> <BR> <BR><b>Font Book warning</b>   <BR>
    <BR>I was eagerly looking forward to replacing Extensis&#39; Suitcase 10 with
    Panther&#39;s  built-in Font Book to manage my 9000 fonts. Tonight I installed
    Panther and immediately  started importing type.  <BR> <BR>I dragged a folder
    of about 2000 fonts into the sets pane as I would in Suitcase  10. What took Suitcase
    30 seconds to process took Font Book about 10 minutes.  When it was done, I realized
    it had activated all 2000 fonts. There does not appear  to be a way to disable
    this activate at addition behavior, which would make the  job of importing 9000
    fonts extremely unpleasant.  <BR> <BR>Fortunately, it was instantly clear that
    Font Book was not going to work for  me. Activating and deactivating was very
    slow, and opening the application with  just 500 fonts took a very long time.
    I began removing my fonts from Font Book.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s where I discovered
    the worst of Font Book&#39;s bad behavior: it had added  each of the fonts to
    a single Fonts folder, DELETING them without warning from  the alphabetical and
    foundry-sorted folders that they have lived in for years.  Had I installed all
    of my fonts, fixing this would have taken much longer than  the half hour I just
    spent on it. Again, there&#39;s no obvious way to disable this  default behavior.  <BR>
    <BR>I wanted to love Font Book, but it has miles to go before it&#39;s any competition  for
    Suitcase or Font Reserve. I have a hard time understanding why Apple hyped  this
    application; getting designers excited about built-in font management software  and
    delivering a tool that definitely won&#39;t address their needs is counter-productive.  The
    upside is that it convinced me to download the Suitcase X1 demo; and I&#39;m extremely  impressed
    with the progress Extensis has made with this application. '
