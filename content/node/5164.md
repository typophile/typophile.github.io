  body: Very austere. I like it. What if you turned it onto a point? 45 degrees? Perhaps
    too corporate in general, but if it represents the couple then that shouldn&#39;t
    matter.

    I really wanted to put that part aside and focus on unity, strength, compromize

  body: How are you envisioning the printing of this? I know it&#39;s best to design
    in b&amp;w to work out proportions and overall design etc. But right now the mark
    looks a little severe and institutional. The ink and paper choice could give it
    a very different feel. An ivory stock with a silvery gray ink could transform
    severe into sophicated &amp; elegant. I also want to add an ampersand &#40;either
    a simple geometric one to go with your design or a very organic curvy one to contrast&#41;
    it might be too cliche, but it might also help to lose the corporation feel.

    An E balancing on point is going to remind people of Enron though. At the time
    of my posting I hadn&#39;t seen the peach colored version which I believe gives
    the mark a more humanistic feel. Your design does evoke the adjectives you hoped
    to express and in addition the ying yang effect of the Es does say man/woman,
    joining, marriage etc. Looking forward to seeing how you lay it out with the other
    type elements.
