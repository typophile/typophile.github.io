  I mainly wanted to make sure I didn&#39;t go too far overboard with the swashes.
  Also is the white type on a mottled background working? are the ragged edges too
  dated/cheesy? lemme know what you think. thnx. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: LighthousePROOF-56360.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*341.5*proof+01*LighthousePROOF%2eswf

  body: Paul you went overboard with the swatches.  <BR> <BR>Not in love with the
    ragged edges its been over done. Did you look at maybe making the photo fade to
    white creating focus on the main subject the lighthouse?  <BR> <BR>The white type
    doesn&#39;t bother me because you don&#39;t have a ton of text.

  body: i guess i recognized all those problems initially, but was unwilling to cut
    back. i&#39;ll hafta go back and see if i can put a little more restraint in it
    for the next version.

  body: okay, i cut back on the swashes and lost the jagged edges. It&#39;s fairly
    clean and straightforward now. Any comments or suggestions are appreciated. Thnx.

  body: Paul, very nice job. One thought, If you did that in Photoshop you might investigate
    making it a duotone or tritone to add a little depth to the image.
