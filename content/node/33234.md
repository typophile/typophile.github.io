  stores (retail, instrument, etc) or musical products (instruments, etc) logotypes
  that are out there in people's online portfolios that I can take a look at. I've
  been searching for some but just come up with the regulars: sam goody, guitarcenter,
  musicians friend... but I'm looking for different ones, that are designed more meticulously.
  Anyone got anything out there for me to look at?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
