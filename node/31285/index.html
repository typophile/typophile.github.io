  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The staff of my high school newspaper is planning a sex and sexuality census to be distributed to every student in grades 9 through 12 (approximately 500 students). I was wondering if I could get some criticism on my rough, current design of the census and teacher instructions sheet (attached). I will resist the urge to discuss the content and methodology of the census further since it is outlined in near-exhaustive detail in the census itself.</p>
<p>For the design, I am using the same typefaces we use for the newspaper after my recent redesign of it to suggest a connection with the newspaper: Farnham Display, Mercury Text, and Myriad Pro. Despite my attempts to make the design aesthetically pleasing, so far it&rsquo;s not so beautiful, partly owing to the amount of text we need to cram onto one piece of paper and the desire to make the text decent size. While suggestions to make it easier on the eyes would be greatly appreciated, I&rsquo;d most like to hear ways to make it clearer and less ambiguous, both design-wise and content-wise. Is there anything that confuses you, even for a second?</p>
<p>One final note: I have pseudo-redacted out the name of the school newspaper, the school, and some other possibly identifying information. If I missed any identifying information, please mention it to me either here or by private message so that I can remove it. Thanks very much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Try using two (or possibly three) columns, your present measure is too wide. For the purpose of data capture it might be sensible to number the questions and letter the answers. Try out using a tick (or cross) box for the answers, much clearer than circling answers and take up less vertical space. You could also try making all the tabs the same which should improve the first appearance. I have to question the requirement to write gender, two tick boxes would do, similarly with grade you don&rsquo;t need the space given it. You should find that you have more space to allow for the further comments, alternatively make the request to write on the back and provide rules to follow, the current space is too small and you will get a cramped area filled with writing. The bold sans in the instructions is way too heavy try using the bold variant of Mercury.

btw censuss on the 3rd line of additional information.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As long as you keep the introductory copy in one section and the questionnaire in another beneath it I don’t see how you are going to create confusion by putting it in columns, but you know your audience. Perhaps you could just use the columns for the questionnaire section.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would also consider putting the &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; answers to the right of the questions, aligned, rather than underneath. Also, where you have left room for &ldquo;gender&rdquo; and &ldquo;level&rdquo;, I would make gender a &ldquo;M/F&rdquo; answer as well as putting the answer spot to the right of the question.</p>
<p>This could free up some vertical space which would allow you to space out some of the instructional text. I don&rsquo;t think it will be confusing mixed with the other questions where the answers clearly need to be listed under the question.</p>
<p>You could also introduce check boxes next to the answers rather than the slashes that you have now.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read it yet for clarity of content, but I&rsquo;ll get back to you if I see anything odd.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, a couple more comments regarding content.</p>
<p>You might consider rewording the first question to &ldquo;which statement most accurately describes how you view your sexuality&rdquo; or something like that.</p>
<p>I see problems with the term &ldquo;serious relationship&rdquo; because the definition may vary from one person to the next. Some might think it&rsquo;s time based, others might think it has to do with intensity of emotion&hellip; However, if what you&rsquo;re after is simply that the respondant sees him or herself as being in a &ldquo;serious relationship&rdquo; then it works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;to reprint all of or excerpts from&hellip;&rdquo; could be rephrased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;when a student has finished, collect their&rdquo; &ndash; this doesn&rsquo;t agree in number. It should be &ldquo;when the students have finished, collect their&rdquo; or &ldquo;when a student has finished, collect his/her&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, a personal irritant, is &ldquo;We of the&rdquo; You can be less wordy! Go for &ldquo;we believe&hellip;&rdquo;  &ndash; by now the people reading the survey know who the &ldquo;we&rdquo; represents.</p>
<p>One more, actually &ndash; I wonder if all the students who will be responding know what &ldquo;sexual intercourse&rdquo; is. I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest  kids are stupid, but definitions vary wildly&hellip; Are you going for the student&rsquo;s concept of what constitutes &ldquo;sexual intercourse&rdquo; or the technical definition? You may want to clarify with a definition or you may want to use a different term, like penetration.</p>
