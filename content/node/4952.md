  body: I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fonts -- I just don&#39;t have time right now to
    find them. But I&#39;m posting the logo for the rest of the eager id-ers out there...

  body: I think that has more to do with bad Illustrator/Corel customization to achieve
    the changes in height the designer desired. In doing so I think the designer simply
    messed up the angles.

  body: It&#39;s very close to the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/marlboro/neo-contact-d/testdrive.html?s=WILD%2BWING&amp;p=72">Marlboro
    typeface</a>, but let me see if I can get any closer. That middle serif on the
    W is kind of the killer.
