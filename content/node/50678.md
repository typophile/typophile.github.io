  body: "Many printers that regularly print packaging will provide layouts of their
    common in-stock box dies. \r\n\r\nOn a quick search I came up with [[http://www.imperialbox.net/boxxtyles.html]],
    but those layouts are all JPEG images. They ought to provide a vector version
    if you ask for it, but I haven't tried myself."
