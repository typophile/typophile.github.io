  although i have been reading\r\nthis forum a lot, with great enthusiasm!\r\n\r\nBut
  let's get down to business.\r\nI have been working on a sans serif font in fontlab.\r\nEverything
  works fine, kerning, ligatures.\r\n\r\nOnly......\r\n\r\nWhen i want to use my font,
  on a existing text in indesign, the ligatures don't work.\r\nBut, if i create a
  new text block, end select my font, and start writing, the ligatures do work.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is, that i want to use the font for a new book i'm designing.\r\nIt has
  a lot of text, which i can't just rewrite.\r\n\r\nI have tried the trick of copy,
  pasting (same font, or first changing it into another), also in a new document,
  \r\nbut same problem keeps on appearing.\r\n\r\nSo hopefully anybody can help me
  any further.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMaarten.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: So your OT code compiles and the ligatures work in your editor but not in
    real life? You'd better show us the code.

  body: It might be an issue related to your tracking value. In InDesign ligatures
    (and other related features) are automatically disabled if your value for tracking
    is too high (while they do work in Illustrator). Try setting Tracking to 0 for
    your text. And, I assume that Ligatures are switched on in your existing text
    :-)

  body: "Both, thanks for the replies. \r\nAnd Martin, you were right, it was just
    that i had the tracking to high, it was at 33 points, and after 30 the ligatures
    stop working.\r\nSo it is fixed, thank god!\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"
