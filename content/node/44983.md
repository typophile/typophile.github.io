  body: "Hmmm...perhaps the \"clean\" element has more to do with my own personal
    taste than the condition of the barn, however it's a wedding venue, so it's a
    lot cleaner than most barns.  :)\r\n\r\np.s.  Thanks, sii!"

  body: 'I associate lettering on barns with faded big blocky sans or slabs from old
    advertisements, especially for "mail pouch tobacco". I see [[http://www.amazon.com/Advertising-Barns-William-Simmonds/dp/0760320837|there''s
    a whole book of photos of these things]], which are so resonant of rural America
    when I was growing up. But that''s probably not what you''re looking for. '

  body: "I made a barn dance invitation about a year ago and ended up using Briem
    Akademi Std (slightly modified), from Adobe's FontFolio.\r\n\r\nIt has nice strait
    edges (I believe it was originally created to not have any rounded curves). It
    looks nice and clean, and barns are usually not constructed with elaborate rounded
    curves, etc... It's very plain and simple, without getting tacky (in my opinion).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barndance_4604.jpg]"

  body: 'It is interesting how the perspective in Barn Dance changes at mid-point
    on each side. D A and part of N in DANCE are are receding correctly, as are N
    and R  in BARN, and then the words curve forward. I wonder if you did this manually
    or relied on a digital distortion envelope? '
