I'd certainly be interested in learning about older examples... and the <em>oldest</em> example. I love traps! BTW in many cases it's difficult to be sure they were stylistic (some of them could be just unusually/unnecessarily large traps) and to me such cases can't count. In Bradlo, there can be no doubt.

		<div class="commentbody">To me, Bell Centennial Bold Listing, though it's inktraps are there for real practical purposes, is by far the earliest font to take the obvious-inktrap approach. Bell Centennial is the grandaddy of these ideas.  It's also interesting that Carter drew it out on graph paper, and someone else created the chirography.  So I would say the later had a lot more control over the final inktrap lines than Carter.  It's just hard to imagine that Carter didn't hand in a somehow rougher version then what was finally published. That's just how designing on graph paper tends to pan out.

Once the design became scalable people naturally had fun making the trapping not only obvious, but the only real reason to use the font.

<blockquote>someone else created the chirography</blockquote>

Easy, easy. Wrapping outlines around bitmaps is at least twice removed from chirography. Probably thrice.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qaab_5834.png]

...would disappear if they were printed on 1970's telephone book printing technologies at the point sizes that ..Bold Listing was printed at?

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>Are you saying that the bitmaps Carter drew were directly inputed into the machines that printed the phone books?</blockquote>

Well, not the machine that *printed* the phone book, but directly encoded as bitmap data for the machine which was destined to typeset the phone book after the conversion — the Linotron 606. (The printing was done by web offset, of course.)

The Linotron 606 was an early digital typesetter, but this was before the widespread use of bezier curves or scalable outlines for letter-shape description. I believe the 606 data was stored in run-length encoding and output in scan lines, but don’t quote me on that. The Postscript format wouldn’t be made public for another couple decades.

There were actually film friskets cut for the Bell Centennial letters to run early tests on standard VIP phototypesetters. And though Carter probably didn’t cut all the friskets himself, he would still have had a close hand in defining those outlines, as well as the eventual bitmaps.</div>

But I <em>am</em> interested in distilling things down to their purest forms as well.

What are good places to put inktraps in a 'S'? I honestly can think of many.

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, Richard Southall's fabulous "Printer's type in the twentieth century" includes a couple of passages about Bell Centennial. Kent is right about the Linotron 606, and the fact that the data was not binary bitmap data but raster line start/stop instructions. The only twist is that those raster lines were actually <em>vertical</em>; that might have actually been for reasons of economy, since [Latin] letterforms have more/thicker vertical stems than horizontal bars - you end up needing fewer start/stop instructions.

Southall also mentions a 1982 monograph by the Cooper Union titled "Matthew Carter: Bell Centennial".

Margaret Re's "The Art of Matthew Carter", and her recent Baseline magazine articles probably shed more light on this.

Its my favorite weight anyway, and also everything is pretty much as exaggerated as it's gonna get (unless there is a bolder weight in the family, like Ultra or something,) so for me it's easier to dial in the details, because they are more obvious.</div>

I'd tend to agree with you there though maybe it's only tangential to my point. 

What I meant was, until the smallest native spaces are determined, where native means those that are there before any ink has gotten trapped, what's the point of designing ink traps. Show me the "f","i" and "g""!

NS "Heavy weight is far harder to design than big x-height."

Really? I run out of y white space long before I run out of black x space.... every time. It's the em I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> The parameters are interrelated. 
I made the statement on the assumption that the comparison is between:
1. Normal x-height, heavy weight
2. Normal weight, large x-height

The issue I ﬁnd with heavy weights is that it’s not just a question of squeezing things in, with limited options, but there is considerable leeway in the width of characters such as /c and /w.
