  loft development is inside a 1940s Sears retail store and I have been hired to design
  these 2 pieces.\r\nI want to pay homage to the era without over doing it and am
  curious if anyone can point me to some 1940 - 1960 Sears logos.\r\nI don't plan
  to use the logos, but might create some graphic elements out of letterforms.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"
