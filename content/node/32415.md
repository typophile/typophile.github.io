body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have to recent logos here that I made about four months ago. I'd
  like some feedback on them. The first one is finished but changes can be made, haven't
  finihsed the website yet and just started making the businesscards.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadline
  Visual Arts (great name)\r\n\r\nThis is for a production company, founded by a friend
  of mine. I'm also part of the company, making dvd covers and stuff. Anyway the idea
  is to portray the company as serious and poweful, with a little hint of humor maybe.
  They make very low budget movies but we make everything look like it's with a little
  bigger budget :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.petergranfors.com/layout/deadline_logo_big.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nDina
  IST 2006\r\n\r\nThis project is over and done. It was a mobile TV project displayed
  at the Helsinki IST fair last year that lasted for three days. Dina is our schools
  tv channel. The logo aint perfect but and I'd like some pointers on this one as
  to what I could've done diffrently and improvment suggestions.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.petergranfors.com/layout/dinaist_logo_big.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nPS.
  I'm pretty new to typography. I don't have much knowledge about it and I just ordered
  a typography book to get a little more insight into the world of typography and
  design in general.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\npeter"

  body: It's not very visually interesting.  The "explosion" doesn't seem to come
    from any particular point, and the red/orange divide will be almost impossible
    to see at any smaller size.  Typographically speaking, Times New Roman has been
    used over and over again by every non-designer on the planet, and it's lost any
    sense of uniqueness it once had.  I can't say I'm a big fan of letterspaced small
    caps, either.  Do some sketches by hand and see what you can do to make it a little
    less staid.

    body: "forgot to add the other link.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started looking at other fonts
      then Times. I found Sabon pretty interesting and I think I'll try that instead.\r\n\r\nPersonally
      I don't have a real problem with the explosion, yet. The filmstrip bothers me
      more for some reason. Gonna try and make some scethes by hand and see if i come
      to a better solution.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    and centered.\r\nIt will look tighter and more elegant! "
