  body: If anything, the idea that x.mas sounds remotely cool or new shows how old
    and out of touch some people at Pentagram really are. Either that or it's just
    a brilliant touch of sarcasm to go along with the idea that Christmas needs re-branding.
    Either way, I hope that they sell copies of the prospectus; <a href="http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2006/12/22">from
    what I've seen online</a> it looks great.

  body: "The irony of graphic designers trying to 'fix' the 'overcommercialization'
    of xmas is just too much.\r\n\r\nAnd .mas? Trite even by non xmas/non designer
    standards. \r\n\r\nUnless, as jpad speculates, they're being sarcastic with the
    x.mas. If so, perhaps they're being a tad too subtle. "

    the problem with Pentagram; sometimes it's to to figure out when the work is amazing
    and when they need to get out of the office more often."
