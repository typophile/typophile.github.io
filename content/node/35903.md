  body: Could have started as type, but it's very hard to make out the individual
    shapes, let alone identify them.

  body: 'Yes, it is supposed to be the letters GV. I think originally whoever created
    the logo used two different fonts, and maybe drew an extra line to the left of
    the V. I can''t figure it out. I''ve been trying to redraw it in Illustrator but
    if I can find the font(s) it would look much better. '
