  lettering?\r\nPopular as architectural lettering on early-mid twentieth century
  social housing especially in london.\r\nAlso similar lettering found on brewery
  signage, Whitbread etc.\r\nExhaustive research is not throwing up many leads at
  the moment.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPete[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agurn_5309.jpg]"

  body: Thanks yes had a look at his early designs for whsmith already and they are
    probably the closest reference yet although the shoulder serifs on the N and A
    are more extreme. Photographic reference I have sourced does show that some of
    their later signage appears to stem from these forms though. Like you suggest
    it would might be a good idea to see if smiths have any early 'corporate branding'
    guidelines. Shudder. Many thanks for your response.
