  body: Thanks! Do you think the differences are just modifications they made? The
    lowercase "c" is the most obvious, but many of the other letters seem to differ
    in subtle ways that make the whole thing feel softer and a little more casual.
    In any case, it looked great on the big screen (it's always nice when they bother
    to kern).

  body: "You're right that the 'c' is not Antenna. Neither is the '&'. It also looks
    like the image quality is fuzzy a bit, or a blur was used to soften the letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    'c' choice is odd, because it seems not to fit well.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
