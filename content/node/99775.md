    place to ask for it. But I need the ID nevertheless.\r\nI'd be also very satisfied
    by getting another suggestion to a similar font... which should be, again, free."

    don't really belong here.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I don't need exactly THIS font. Every font which is at least a little similar
    will do quite fine. So I don't want it pirated. I just don't use it in a professinal
    way so I don't want to pay 30$.
