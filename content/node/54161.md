    favour is could you list the top 5/6 most important/popular serrifed and unserrifed
    fonts between 1900 and 2008 ?\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a list of 5/6 sans
    fonts in chronological order and the same for serrifed.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."

    could also do 2 lists with one being most important and the other popular.\r\n\r\nI
    don't really mind to be honest, it will be nice to see peoples opinions."
