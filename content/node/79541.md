  I had really no idea where else to go. \r\n( And this forum has always been so obliging
  in the past. )\r\n\r\nI am trying to hunt down the name for this particular sort
  of device do-dad. I know it has been used many times for infographics and in puzzle
  games etc.\r\nSome have called it a pinwheel but I know that's not right. \r\n\r\nBut
  I just can't figure out the name.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a digital form of this
  thing:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.andrewbosley.com/the-brainstormer.html\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    called Proportion Wheels.
