  body: What the.. I hacked in my reply as soon as I got the topic notification mail,
    and still you&#39;re 2 minutes faster. You&#39;re obviously so advanced that you
    can identify samples <i>before</i> they are posted. Whoa. What can I do to get
    to that level?

  body: Well, against my ISP&#39;s request, I set my send &amp; receive schedule to
    every two minutes. Combine that with how long it takes the Typophile server to
    send out the notification, which is sometimes faster than others, and there it
    is. <BR> <BR>Now, while I had the faster ID, I opted to post it w/o a link, so
    while I was away, getting the link and then realizing my mistake, you&#39;d slipped
    in with the right ID. So it is I who bow to you, Franz. The time thing was just
    luck on my part. <BR> <BR>Oh, and Tanya? You are no idiot by any stretch. A little
    starry-eyed sometimes, though... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Oh. Luck, huh? And here I was thinking your typographic prowess actually enabled
    you to tear gateways in the fabric of space-time.. Duh. I look really stupid now.
