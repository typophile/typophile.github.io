    and [[Margaret Calvert]]'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Alphabet\"
    target=\"new\">Rail Alphabet</a>?\r\n\r\nIn the mid 70's I went to Maidstone College
    of Art in Kent, UK. I recall lots of British Rail brand guideline posters all
    over the walls in the commercial design studio. In those days, I was committed
    to drawing, painting and latterly, photography and had little more than a passing
    interest in graphic design and typography.\r\n\r\nGiven the quantity, and quality,
    of material on the walls, I suspect there was a connection between the design
    team and the college.\r\n\r\nI wish I had paid more attention at the time."
