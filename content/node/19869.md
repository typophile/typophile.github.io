  body: You'd think if you could load a bigger version of that W into "What the Font"
    it would identify it. I haven't seen a lot of them that look like that. (Not that
    I've had tremendous success with that MyFonts feature...but don't get me wrong,

  body: "That W* is really ugly. There's something odd about it, as if someone stroked
    a thinner face and did some squooshing.\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>
    from Font Bureau has a similar W. I still don't like it..."
