body: "First of all, hello everyone. I'll come clean that this is my first post, but
  I have community aspirations... honest. I've had a long look around and I love what
  I see here on the boards.\r\n\r\nPlease have at me on this one. I'm quite close
  to the project, which has worked both for and against its success. So far as the
  type design has gone, I'd love the eyes of a master or two <em>before</em> it hits
  signage and letterpress plates.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nI'd very much appreciate
  a technical focus, which is why I've kept the background/design brief ambiguous
  (for now). I think there's plenty to discuss in the type itself. A few relevant
  details:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I drew the type from scratch in response to other identity
  elements. The proportions of the H and the 45-degree cuts were my starting points
  in common.</li>\r\n<li>The application will include letterpress cards, glass etching,
  and metalwork.</li>\r\n<li>Screen readability is very important in the final product.
  I'd very much like advice towards that goal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward
  to your thoughts. Please, tease apart the nuances, chew on it, spit it back at me.

  body: Question, why didn't you modify your E by either adding a spur or slanting
    some of the end terminals. It doesn't fit with the other characters.

  body: "I agree with Dan's comment. \r\nAnd I like the logotype overall, but I wonder
    why some details are applied once or twice, but not globally: \r\nThe \"crash
    notch\" in the U.\r\nThe serifettes in the H, G, L, and D. \r\nYou are having
    just a little trouble with the curves in the G. \r\nAre the horizontal strokes
    the same width as the verticals? The horizontals should be a bit thinner to look
    the same as the verticals.\r\nTo reiterate and expand on Dan's comment: why are
    some terminals angled, but not all? What's the reasoning?\r\nAgain, I like this,
    but I'm left with questions."

    body: "Some good, provacative questioning here. Thank you for your time, first
      of all.\r\n\r\nPlease don't let my rationale lead your reaction to the design,
      but here's a little more meat.  The full system incorporates a heraldic design
      that has been smartly modernized (and I solemnly swear I did this without gradients
      and 3D effects). Beginning with our name, the identity is hinged on executing
      the traditional model of a \"guild\" in a modern, relevant, even forward-looking
      manner.\r\n\r\nOther design impulses: a little mystique, gravitas, craft/quality/integrity,
      initiative/passion.\r\n\r\nSo details like the angled terminals are designed
      to create a particular movement through the word that relates to an angle used
      in the shield design. I wanted this to be deliberate, and lose the visual impact
      in applying it globally.\r\n\r\nI placed the serifs through a reductive process,
      and stopped when I felt like the survivors each needed to be there.\r\n\r\nIn
      the end, I might have been to precious about the E. You're both right that it
      falls right out of line. I'll post a revision soon.\r\n\r\n> Are the horizontal
      strokes the same width as the verticals?\r\n\r\nNo, the horizontal strokes are
      about 92% of the verticals (77:71 units exactly). Essentially, I want to achieve
      optical harmony without tipping over into an overly calligraphic stroke, for
      very good reasons. As the identity system incorporates a heraldic design, the
      goal is to avoid going too medieval with the type. All said, what do you think
      of the relationship in the larger sample? Am I tiptoeing too gently with the
      contrast?\r\n\r\nI did have a hard time developing the G, but was <em>just</em>
      starting to be happy with it. Can you please elaborate on \"just a little trouble\"?
      Here's a larger drawing of it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/theguild_g.png]\r\n\r\nI
      was working with two versions at the time of this image, opting for the second
      one in the end. The question here was to thin it out for appearance, or bulk
      it up to create a little more emphasis on the character's main feature. Another
      design aspect, such as the height of the top-left stroke's arc, is to make the
      counter as roomy and \"open\" as possible.\r\n\r\nI have to run my dog to the
      vet now but will return with more versions. Please continue with this excellent
      feedback (I can see all you lurkers out there).\r\n"

  body: "I think that your choice of G was probably correct, however the strokes seem
    to flatten out slightly on the right, especially before the spur, it is difficult
    with screen representations to  really be certain, but I think that a slight increase
    in roundness might be required. The transistion from vertical to curve on the
    left of the U seems abrupt inside the counter. I would be concerned about reproduction
    at small sizes in the areas around the TH where the angle (of the T) almost seems
    like a serif. The horizontals on the E and L also represent as slightly too heavy.\r\nTim"

  body: "timd has said what I was going to: the curve transitions in the G need a
    little work. And the horizontal strokes seem a little heavy, even with the compensation
    made so far.\r\n\r\nOne other thing: spacing. The G needs to move towards the
    U a little bit. This will also open up the word space. I know that you're separting
    the words with colour, but a little bit of air in there will probably help."

    body: "Thank you all for your guidance. I'm feeling much more confident in the
      result, having pulled my outlines into FontLab (previously in Illustrator, from
      inkings) and addressing the finer curves. The spur of the G especially made
      a difference, I think. \r\n\r\nThe E has been brought into line with the overall
      design, balancing nicely against the U.\r\n\r\nA few of the rasterizations could
      use a touch of hinting (the worst ist probably the right-middle) but for the
      most part it reduces smartly. Quite pleased aspect, as we'll have our share
      of screen applications. \r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your insights. Please e-mail
      me if you're interested in the resulting identity system, or a PDF of this revision.\r\n\r\n-Nicholas\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/theguild_typophile_v2.png]"

    body: "I fixed my e-mail settings, it should allow private messaging now.\r\n\r\nDan,
      no need to apologize. I just popped into fontlab and created alternate H, I
      glyphs to see what happens when I try utter consistancy. I feel pretty strongly
      that it's a mistake:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/theguild_typophile_dw.png]\r\n<em>(not
      happening for me)</em>\r\n\r\nIn my earlier design, I find the spurs and angles
      very complimentary, both in form and through their balanced placement throughout
      the mark. That's to say I don't find it all too inconsistent, but rather integral.
      Especially so now that I've worked on the E (in part because of your initial
      remarks, Dan).\r\n\r\nI truly believe that people \"other than in the know\"
      will respond more to <em>qualities</em> such as \"considered\" and \"elegant\"
      than if it was overly ornamented (\"busy\" and \"a font\"); that audience isn't
      attentive enough to those details to <em>quantify</em> them as a mistakes.\r\n\r\nThank
      you again for your feedback."

  body: "The inktrap feature on the U works well but seems superfluous/misplaced*
    on the E, the angled terminal is enough although I wonder if it would be better
    the other way up (nibbling more into the bottom of the bar).\r\n* superfluous/misplaced,
    as in, why shouldn't every junction of the E have one. \r\n\r\nI disagree with
    Chris on the terminal of the H, it kind of looks like it is dipping its toe in
    the water (to anthropomorphise a letter:). Although seeing them all in black I
    think you have a kerning issue on the TH and HE.\r\nOverall I think you are right
    to resist the temptation to unify all the the letters by applying terminals and
    serifs in each case, because as you say it would make it look busy.\r\nTim"

    job with THE in one spot and GUILD in another? If the former, I'm worried that
    those serifs may start to break up.\r\n\r\nI almost think the E has too much weight
    on it - its stem feels heavier than the legs of the H. I preferred the first version
    of the E posted to the revised one, as it draws a bit too much attention with
    the two diagonal cuts; did you try slicing the end of its lowest arm instead of
    the middle one?"

  body: Since Chris mentioned the spacing, the spacing of the HE is way too much.
    The E almost looks like it could belong to Guild. Also you need to make it read
    The Guild instead of TheGuild
