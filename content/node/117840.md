    'by' should be set in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/dream-lover|Dream

  body: TJ Evolette A Light is being used on the website, and for some of the type
    in the printed collateral. However, I'm not seeing the curved-footed R in the
    glyphs, so that may be custom.

    hasty to conclude. The other samples are surely using Dream Lover and as there're
    no alternates corresponding to these glyphs but still convinced it's the same
    font, they may have customized it."
