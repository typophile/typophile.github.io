  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Well, my account page says I&rsquo;ve now been on Typophile for 4 years.
Where does the time go?</p>
<p>Over this time I&rsquo;ve asked a few questions, suggested an answer or two, and entered a few of the design challenges (sometimes aquitting myself quite reasonably, at other times making a bit of a tit of myself).</p>
<p>It might be worth explaining at this point, as George Formby once said, why I&rsquo;m here and what my motives are.</p>
<p>Unlike the more useful Typophiles, I&rsquo;m not a professional typographer or type designer, nor even a graphic designer. I&rsquo;m just one of the many interested amateurs. But I do like to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo;. There are any number of creative endeavours – typography, cartooning, solving and compiling cryptic crosswords, Escher-style tessellations, hand bookbinding, ambigrams, – where I&rsquo;ve seen and admired other people&rsquo;s work, and thought to myself, &ldquo;I wonder if I could do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the answer often turns out to be: A bit: Just well enough to impress friends and colleagues who can&rsquo;t do whatever-it-was at all, but not well enough to run with the folks who do it for a living. And that doesn&rsquo;t really matter much, so long as I enjoy myself when I have a go.</p>
<p>My actual background stems from several years checking and formatting corporate documentation, which is why many of my posts involve standing up for MS Word. Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of typographic stuff that it can&rsquo;t do (or can&rsquo;t do very well), but there&rsquo;s also a hell of a lot of other clever stuff that it <em>can</em> do, which you only wish some of the DTP packages could do. And, it&rsquo;s a lot better than most users' experience of it would suggest: you just have to learn its idiosyncracies, which settings to switch off, which to switch on, and which toolbar buttons to avoid like a Mexican pig farmer with the sneezes.</p>
<p>I now work in the production department of the academic journals division of an international publisher, which is nice because it&rsquo;s an environment in which the desire to fix other people&rsquo;s spelling mistakes is a trait that&rsquo;s welcome, rather than considered an irritant (as it may have been in some previous jobs&hellip;). This job involves liaising between authors, editors, typesetters and printers. Some authors can be a pain when they don&rsquo;t understand that if our typesetters have already had their paper for a fortnight, any necessary changes should <em>not</em> be supplied as a whole fresh version of the original manuscript Word file. Or when they don&rsquo;t understand that if a 72-dpi image found off the web isn&rsquo;t good enough resolution for print, just opening that image in Paint Shop Pro and resaving it at 300 dpi isn&rsquo;t going to suddenly fill it with detail. Some editors can be a pain when they&rsquo;ve had the production schedule all year but still insist on submitting their editorials about a month after the stated deadline. Some typesetters can be a pain when they unaccountably set the © symbol in a different font from the surrounding text, or use the letters TM superscripted instead of the proper ™ character, or tighten the tracking to make a paragraph fit, but then forget to loosen it again after the author&rsquo;s marked up to delete several words. Our printers, touch wood, are all great and have so far never proven to be a pain. Hurrah!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a huge amount of scope for typographic self-expression, but I can&hellip;
(a) politely request that the typesetters do not hyphenate &ldquo;streetsweeper&rdquo; as &ldquo;streets-weeper&rdquo; or &ldquo;therapists&rdquo; as &ldquo;the-rapists&rdquo;, 
(b) occasionally get the opportunity to set a call for papers (when there just isn&rsquo;t the time to get them to do it and go round the intercontinental revise-amend-revise cycle with them), or an advert (when a non-print-savvy client pays for a half-page ad but supplies a full letter page of double-spaced Verdana rather than a pre-typeset PDF like everybody else) myself,
(c) suggest alternative approaches when a new journal&rsquo;s being launched and the designer hired to do the cover offers hideous ideas containing photos with a perspective effect applied for no readily apparent reason other than that he&rsquo;s found that with his new version of InDesign he <em>can</em>.</p>
<p>MS Word anecdote as an aside: In our department, one colleague produced and printed out a little insert to fit in a tray, with all our names in Times full caps and the numbers of the drinks we prefer from the drinks machine (so that anyone doing a drinks run would be able to remember who has what). Everyone else&rsquo;s names happen to contain letters that fit reasonably. Remember that Word has kerning switched off by default. The yawning gap between the A and V in DAVID on this insert gnawed at me for days. Eventually some drinks were spilled on the tray and my colleague opened the file to reprint it. I leapt in: &ldquo;Select all&hellip; now, go to format &gt; font &gt; character spacing &hellip; and switch on that kerning tickbox. Now watch my name when you hit OK.&rdquo; Thankfully she appreciated this new bit of type awareness and didn&rsquo;t simply brain me with the tray&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been here for years and not getting better either, but I&rsquo;m still enjoying every thread. I dont know why, I just never get bored with typography. The only reason I&rsquo;m being passive in this forum is because my English is bed. See? :D</p>
