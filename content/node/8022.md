body: Hello <BR> <BR>My name is Ragnar and I am from Iceland. I am currently studying
  graphic design at the Iceland Academy of the Arts for a Bachelor Degree and will
  be graduating in spring 2005. Right now I am wondering how I should continue my
  education. <BR> <BR>I have a lot of interest in typographic design. Not designing
  typefaces as such but the act of designing with typefaces. <BR> <BR>So I was wondering
  if someone here could point to me to schools that offer MA programs in typographic
  design or something similar. They can be anywear in the world. I am open to anything!
  <BR> <BR>Thanks alot, <BR> <BR>Ragnar Freyr <BR><a href="http://www.onrushdesign.com"

  body: Do you have a financial limitations? Must it be in the EU? Are you dead-set
    on formal education? Have you considered doing an internship first, one that might
    perhaps be with a company that does a lot of typographic design? Do you admire
    any typographic designers? Do they have internships?

  body: What languages do you speak? This could be a bonus and/or limitation in the
    short run. For instance, if you don&#39;t speak French or German, you wouldn&#39;t
    be able to start at most French or German institutions right away. Of course,
    you speak English, which will allow you to study just about everywhere else. <BR>
    <BR>If you are looking for typographic, and not type design programs, Switzerland
    has several choices &#40;but that is both cliche

  body: This is off the topic a bit, but,  <BR> <BR>Is type design getting more &#34;popular&#34;
    recently or is typophile simply making a small, passionate community heard louder
    &#40;even if only to each other&#41;. It seems like there is an ever increasing
    number of posts regarding people interested in pursuing places of higher education
    that offer type design. <BR> <BR>I have only been hanging out here for the last
    11 months, so I don&#39;t know how much this has come up in the past. While there
    is a lot of debate over the vast amount of type currently available, it is clear
    that the more demand there is for type education

  body: I don&#39;t think Typophile is a good indicator of general popularity. But
    radio shows and newspapers certainly are! And there has indeed been an mini-explosion
    of type talk in mass media lately. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I think that teaching type design is becoming more popular. That is why more
    institutions are starting to do it, even if a few bad apples like ENSAD axed it
    out of their programs altogether recently. <BR> <BR>Of course, before the 1980s,
    lettering and &#34;type&#34; design &#40;what one might call typeface concept
    design&#41; was a much more integral part of general graphic design education.
    In general, I would wager that even in this present renewal, far less people are
    being exposed to the details of letter drawing than in the past. However, the
    current &#34;type design&#34; educational opportunities, where one can be taught
    aesthetics, theory, and practice all at once, and in the span of a year at that,
    is ground-breakingly new, in my opinion.

  body: Hi everyone <BR> <BR>On the subject of type design programs - are there any
    suggestions on schools/locations? <BR> <BR>I am currently in the US and have been
    a very active graphic designer the 6 years since completing my BFA &#40;including
    collegiate adjunct facility experience&#41;. I wish to attend a MFA program with
    an emphasis on type face design. <BR> <BR>I appreciate any assitance!
