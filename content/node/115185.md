    body: "Hey Mark!\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your interest.\r\nI would love to inform
      you about new things but I am afraid there isn\u2019t much at the moment. For
      I am a graphic designer to earn my money and at the moment I have quite a hard
      time to stand up. \r\nI would need kind of a sponsor ;-) to keep on designing
      fonts for as you certainly know it is such an intense breath and time taking
      work. Yet, I still love it and will go on as soon as I can.\r\nMaybe I am too
      much into web design right now. So hard to tell these times which direction
      is the right one to go.\r\nFeel free however to comment everything. I promise
      to put more pictures here over the time.\r\n\r\nStefan"
