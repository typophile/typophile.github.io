  Fusion seems a bit buggier than it used to. I'm using version 12.1.7 currently...
  \r\n\r\nI've never really used anything but Suitcase for font management, but I'm
  willing to try something new. Any recommendations, or should I stick with what I'm
  used to? What about the native font management in Leopard? \r\n\r\nI'd love some
  point/counterpoint on this topic as I'm fairly ignorant on the whole subject.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    of what's bundled with the system.\r\n\r\nLinotype FontExplorer X is a very good
    alternative to Suitcase Fusion, and it's free!"

  body: "I met with the developers of FontAgent Pro a couple of years ago and I was
    very impressed. But I haven't tried the program yet. It may very well be the answer.
    Short of that, the best thing to do is to petition Adobe to bring back ATM Deluxe,
    which has always been the best font manager out there. \r\n\r\nWhy isn't it here?
    What went wrong?\r\n\r\nWell, ATM Deluxe didn't sell well, that's the main problem.
    Is it possible it was well under 50,000 copies, or does my memory deceive? The
    main problem with the Mac version was that it checked and invalidated the majority
    of competitor Bitstream and Monotype's fonts. That this was a desperate political
    move to encourage designers to use only Adobe fonts might be illustrated by two
    facts: (1) the problem was never fixed between the first version of Deluxe for
    Mac, 4.0, and the last, 4.6; and (2) the invalidation trick wasn't performed in
    ATM for Windows -- where designers don't, by a majority, live.\r\n\r\nFor whatever
    reason, Adobe decided to move all ATM functionality except font management (which
    meant PostScript rasterization and subpixel anti-aliasing) into its apps under
    the once-secret codename 'CoolType'. CoolType doesn't only mean anti-aliasing;
    it means making every Adobe app capable of rasterizing any Adobe font regardless
    of the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nYou can see that these actions came
    out of paranoia: that designers wouldn't primarily use Adobe fonts; that OS developers
    would pull the rug from under PostScript. \r\n\r\nThese fears were well-founded.
    What was wrong, I think, was Adobe's response. It simply wasn't necessary to pull
    font management out of the picture. This is something Adobe seems to understand,
    intuitively, better than any other company, in spite of its mishaps with font-interface
    strategy (MM numbers from 100 to 1000 is the best example of that). \r\n\r\nTo
    this day, there isn't a more reliable font manager for Vista than the old ATM
    for NT. OS X users deserve a chance to use Adobe's bulletproof font database programming.
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, the fact that ATM for NT still works under Vista means that
    Multiple Master fonts still work transparently in every existing application under
    Vista."

  body: The best font management system I have found is the Finder. Now that you can
    preview fonts and create folders inside of the Library/Fonts folder, I simply
    create a "fonts" folder for each project and drag them in and out of Library/Fonts
    to install/uninstall. In my experience all font management software does is screw
    up my fonts folder, corrupt fonts and crash my machine.

  body: "Christian, \r\n\r\nI agree that with Leopard's native font previews in Finder,
    working with native font files without any management software is easier. This
    combined with Spotlight may be a reasonable working method. \r\n\r\nThe reason
    I love Linotype FontExplorer X is that it stores its data in a SQLite database
    which I can programatically access from Python. I've written a few Python scripts
    that use the \"Comment\" field in FontExplorer's database to store extra metadata
    for various fonts. Then I can use the smart sets to filter out various sets. Very
    practical. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    problems with FontExplorer? \r\n\r\nAdam, a Fontlab-font management question:
    am I correct that with OS X and InDesign, if you generate a font to InDesign's
    font folder, you will always output the latest version? \r\nWhat else do you have
    to do? Close active documents that use the font and open again? Does the same
    work in Windows? And what do you do if you are using Quark 8, Win and Mac? "

    and I've found it fast (definitely fastest out of all products I tested) and reliable.
    I've even had over 65,535 fonts and it worked. \r\n\r\nSuitcase and Font Agent
    Pro were horribly slow on such large databases or produced errors (started overwriting
    the first records in the database after indexing 65,535 fonts), while Bitstream
    Font Navigator for Windows was still fast but, well, had the same problem (65,535
    fonts was the maximum). \r\n\r\nIf you generate the font directly into one of
    InDesign's or Adobe's private font folders:\r\n/Applications/Adobe InDesign CS4/Fonts/\r\n~/Library/Application
    Support/Adobe/Fonts/\r\n/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/\r\nthen InDesign
    will automatically update the font if you switch to it, even if you overwrite
    it. But remember not to change any family/style naming between iterations -- if
    you do, you should remove all the AdobeFnt*.lst files and relaunch InDesign, otherwise
    it may get confused. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "I am really glad to hear good things about Font Agent Pro because I want
    an alternate to Suitcase. \r\n\r\nI fully intend to go from OS 10.4 to 10.5 soon,
    along with a host of other software upgrades. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only
    one who struggles with upgrades and the ensuing disruptions they create. I am
    trying to keep up with the software companies but am losing the battle. As I try
    to keep up with Adobe and Microsoft, I really need stability in my font manager.
    I use Suitcase X1, which I went back to reluctantly years ago when Adobe abandoned
    ATM Deluxe. But Extensis is so quick to jump ahead to the next generation with
    Fusion 2, that I recently wrote them about my concerns regarding their Suitcase
    offerings for people like me who are slow to upgrade. \r\n\r\nThis was the exchange:\r\n\r\nI
    wrote: \r\nI have slipped behind in software upgrades. I am trying to upgrade
    now, as much as my budget will allow for, but I see that you have already jumped
    to an upgrade (Fusion 2) whose minimum requirements goes past my processor capabilities
    and Operating System. I am currently using Suitcase X1 and would like to stay
    as current as I can, but my computer is a G4 and I operate on 10.4. Do you have
    any suggestions, or should I find another way to manage my fonts that doesn't
    include your software? You don't offer Fusion anymore, so what am I supposed to
    do?\r\n\r\nI am getting increasingly discouraged by the rash of recent software
    upgrades that are not backward compatible (this includes Adobe and Microsoft).
    \ I sometimes wish that software companies would realize that some of your customers
    are suffering hard times. I can barely afford any new upgrades, let alone new
    computers and operating systems. Has anyone looked at a newspaper lately?\r\n\r\nThey
    replied:\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nWe have a limited amount of licensing available
    for Suitcase Fusion 1, but it is offered on a case by case basis. Be aware: Suitcase
    Fusion only supports CS2, and CS3, and Quark 6.5 and Quark 7. It also requries
    a 1GHz processor or better, as well as 256megs of RAM. Due to the advanced age
    of your hardware/ software, Suitcase Fusion may be of little or no use to you.
    We will also be unable to give you any sort of technical support on Suitcase Fusion
    as of 10/20/2008. The upgrade is fully priced at $49.98.\r\n\r\nIf you find these
    terms/ circumstances acceptable, please give a call at the number listed below
    and we will help you place an order for the previous version software. Thank you.\r\n\r\nKind
    Regards,\r\nCustomer Service\r\n\r\nHmm. Nice. Let me think, should I buy a new
    computer so I can use Fusion 2? Maybe not in this economy. I think it's time to
    \ find another font manager. I'll just have to limp along with my archaic G4.
    Hopefully Insider Software is a little less arrogant and a little more helpful
    to designers like me who opt for stability rather than having the latest thing.\r\n\r\nJim"

  body: "Well,\r\n\r\nI used FAP 3 until Fontexplorer appeared. It was the Fontmanager
    I was waiting for. It worked like a charm in Tiger, but since upgrading to Leopard
    I encountered some problems. \r\n- System font activation status isn't always
    up to date. I manage my System fonts with fontbook, but Fontexplorer doesn't recognize
    the status of the fonts in Fontbook.\r\n- With every restart, I have to \"refresh
    fonts\" to activate all the fonts that were activated before the restart. If you
    don't do this before starting an CS-app, you're screwed. You'll have to activate
    all your fonts again by hand. Annoying.\r\n- It crashes now and then (but keeps
    running, funny)\r\n- it takes a long time until they have updated PlugIns (Suitcase
    Fusion 2 has the CS4 plugins). I would like to update to CS4 this year, but I
    know the CS4-plugins for Fontexplorer won't be released until Q1 next year\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd
    I love to see a Support Forum that's moderated by Linotype itself. But it's a
    free application, so maybe that's not possible (altough I would gladly pay for
    this kind of app).\r\n\r\n@Hanneman: Despite my problems in Leopard, I think Fontexplorer
    is a very good (maybe the best) & cheap choice as fontmanager in 10.4\r\n\r\nHas
