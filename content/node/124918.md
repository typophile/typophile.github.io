  Jenson? Anyone have any idea what book it might be?

  body: "It's definitely printed, minus the handlettered initials.\r\n\r\nA friend
    who's a rare book expert helped me out with this. It is from a law book printed
    by Jenson in 1476. This page is about wills. It is obviously not the roman type
    that Jenson is famous for; it's a rotunda that he apparently cut late in his career.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    not what I was expecting to find at an American memoribilia fair. The dealer didn't
    even know he had it, or what it was. As an artifact, apparently not particularly
    rare or valuable. Just really cool."
