body: Which type do you think suits the target audience of 16-24 yrs olds? This is
  a magazine advert and I would like feedback. I have other advertising mediums too
  but would like feedback on this first so I can develop the others in the similar
  manner. Thank you.

      I have a feeling my layouts are not still right at the moment for the others.
      Would you like to see them? :)\r\nPS Can you think of any other typefaces that
      could be used? I'm definately going for san serif. Any ideas? Thanks in advance."

    body: hmmmmmm, so what would be your solution to that? Should I enlarge the pt
      size? or should I change typeface completely? If so, what typeface would you
      recommend? I'd like to know your views. Thanks.

  body: I think Eurostyle works well, except that "PLAY ON" doesn't look great in
    that particular face at that size. Perhaps you could use a different face for
    "PLAY ON" and Eurostyle elsewhere?

    body: hmmmm, now that's the confusing part. Am I allowed to use 2 faces on one
      particular piece? If so, what are the rules? Should the typeface be in contrast
      with the focal typeface or not? Please educate me :)

  body: "To change the Chlorine \"a\" you could redraw the \"serif\" to angle it away
    from the letter or turn it at a right angle, making it more prominent. I would
    use more leading than you have and for the longest truth turn over \"what\" so
    \"what kind\" is on one line and centre on the height of the lozenge, and draw
    up an apostrophe.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view you should create a lefthand
    and righthand version of the advertisement, currently your layout would almost
    work for a recto (righthand page) but if used as a verso the dares, logo and pictures
    would be partially obscured by the binding, (I say almost because most magazines
    will specify a safe type area which will be approximately 20mm less than the printed
    dimensions to take into account of trimming). \r\n\r\nThe various elements are
    somewhat disconnected, I would be tempted to move the headline and arrow element
    up and make the body copy more prominent and larger and to the same measure as
    the headline and turn over the lines to represent the meaning better.\r\n\r\nAs
    for mixing up typefaces there are no rules, essentially you can easily use two
    or three typefaces in this instance, for example, a display face for the headings,
    a text face for the body copy and another for the dares \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t
    mix similar typefaces, say, a pair of humanist sans or a pair of venetian serifs
    (although it can be done), it really is down to looking at combinations and making
    your own judgement. In this case however I think you are better off using one
    and making that work well.\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: " Do you think that the Chlorine typeface is good enough to communicate
      'Play'? Is it playful enough? Do you think that the typeface works for the bodycopy
      because i have had to increase the leading? Is it right? I have hardly ever
      played with the leading but I would like to know what you think. Could you recommend
      another 'playful, energetic' face appropriate to this particular theme? What
      about:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/rhino.font?text=PLAY+ON%21+where+ever+you+are\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/thickhead.font?text=PLAY+ON%21+where+ever+you+are\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/heartbreaker.font?text=PLAY+ON%21+where+ever+you+are\r\n\r\nor

  body: "Chlorine works on a level (because it has no uppercase, extended body copy
    will not be the best but in this limited situation it should be fine) it is a
    mixture of fun and techno and fits my appreciation of the demographic and your
    triangle.\r\n\r\nLeading is crucial in all situations, the default 20% of Quark
    and, I believe, InDesign is sufficient for many typefaces in most text settings
    but when working with a free font and all that brings with it in terms of kerning
    and spacing, you should apply your own leading and kerning because at the moment
    the leading is way too tight, I cannot see the kerning clearly enough to comment.
    As for the turn overs in the body copy I would make the last three sentences of
    your body single lines (or paragraphs) and break the first sentence to suit the
    line length you create. btw I think you are missing an \"are\" in the second last
    sentence.\r\n\r\nTim"
