body: "I am pleased to announce that after a long period of elaborate development,
  my second type family, Sindelar, is now available. It is the ideal text face choice
  for newspapers and magazines, comes in 18 styles and was designed between 2009 and
  2014. Sindelar is published by Willerstorfer Font Foundry and is available for purchase
  at [[http://www.willerstorfer.com]]\r\n\r\n<strong>About Sindelar</strong>\r\nSindelar
  is a capable, contemporary text face addressing today\u2019s news design requirements.
  Its large x-height, low contrast and robust serifs grant a high legibility in small
  sizes. The balanced, well chosen proportions make the typeface economic (i.e. space
  saving) without giving it a too narrow appearance. These characteristics make it
  the ideal choice for extensive text setting in newspapers and magazines \u2013 on
  paper and on screen (webfonts available soon).\r\n\_\_\_\_ Named after famous Austrian
  football (soccer) player Matthias Sindelar (1903\u20131939), one of the best players
  of his time, the typeface shares two major qualities with its namesake: their technical
  brilliance and their way of performing aesthetically to the last detail. The football
  player\u2019s nickname \xBBDer Papierene\xAB (the Paper-man) elegantly refers to
  the media too.\r\n\_\_\_\_ Although optimised for small sizes, Sindelar\u2019s low
  contrast and robust serifs give the typeface a strong impact and an unmistakable
  personality in larger sizes. Sindelar\u2019s calligraphic influences can be noticed
  in the Italics best. The italic letters are inclined by slightly different angles,
  respecting the letters\u2019 shapes and proportions and resulting in a balanced,
  yet vivid appearance. Sindelar comes in 18 styles \u2013 nine weights in Roman and
  Italic each. Each font is equipped with a huge character set of about 980 glyphs
  and various OpenType features.\r\n\_\_\_\_ The comprehensive specimen PDF gives
  you an excellent overview of the type family Sindelar. It shows various samples
  of all styles, the full character set, and informs you of all supported OpenType
  features. Download the specimen PDF [[http://www.willerstorfer.com/Sindelar_Specimen.pdf|here.]]"
