		<div class="commentbody">Forgive me Noah, as I've not read all of your other threads about this face. I'm a novice type designer and still have a lot to learn, but I can offer a little bit of a few things that I feel when looking at your face.

1) I haven't quite figured out the logic of your rounded corners vs. your squared off corners. I don't see any consistency in that design aspect.

2) Watch the weight of your strokes and stems, for example your K needs more weight on the strokes because your stem looks much heavier. On your R the bowl needs to be heavier and the weight of your junction strokes need to be consistent with your D and B.
 
3) Your X doesn't quite make sense to me, it seems you're going for a sans serif with a high stroke contrast... I think you can play it up more with this character. The rounded corners also don't quite work for me.

4) The Q has too many features. I would simplify it.

5) Your "c" has the perception of being too narrow in comparison to your b, d, and e. Your e and c look like they're from different planets.

6) V and A need a closer relationship.

7) None of your hooks (J, j, g, y) have a consistent style.

8) Crossbar of "t" is too heavy.

I hope that's not too harsh. All in all, I like the ideas, but if this face is to be used at all for body copy you have to limit the number of features. People should read words, not identify individual letters. While your letters are nice to look at, there doesn't seem to be a complete harmony between them yet. I think what you have posted is a definite improvement over before, and I have seen your other type designs posted here as well and I think you have a promising future ahead. I hope this helps, good luck. </div>

Then I revised <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/whipple2-5173.swf" target="_blank">whipple</a> a little bit more.

While the letter forms aren't exact, the similarities are pretty amazing. My letters are much more square, while your letters are slightly more rounded. There are glaring issues in my character design & kerning efforts, however I was working on that font almost two years ago and still haven't finished.

I'm not saying that you copied my font by any means, but it's darn close.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm sorry to disapoint, however; not only is this the first time I've ever seen your font but I also fail to see any similarities between "whipple" and kisbefe2 beyond the fact that they are both sans serif. Whipple has irregular strokes and a handwritten feel (the loop in the "d" or the exit stroke on the "t" are two examples).

Frankly, were I not convinced that your "I'm not saying that you copied my font by any means" is not an attempt at apophasis so much as a poor choice of words, I would be offended by the implication of your statement and amazed that you would attempt to make such a tenuous connection. The evolution of kisbefe2 can be traced through this forum from its beginnings as a one hour doodle <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/nsans1a-65284.pdf" target="_blank">shown here</a> (<a href="http://typophile.com/node/9241" target="_blank">thread here</a>) to a more mature but still rather poor face called <a href="http://typophile.com/node/12522" target="_blank">KisbefeSans</a> and later just Kisbefe.

		<div class="commentbody">OK dude, here's the deal:
I'll do some more critting, but then I have to stop. Really. Sorry.
Has to do with my New Years resolution, you see.

--

The diagonals are nicely fixed.

The terminals of the "C" don't work: just do what you did in the "G".

I'd lower the bar of the "F".

I'd give the "P" a bigger head.

I'd worry about the clotting in the "Q".

The "S" is a bit <strong>too</strong> malformed.

UC Widths:
Make the "K", "W" and "Y" wider.
Make the "U", "X" and "Z" narrower.

The "f" should have a thinner stroke at top.

"i"/"j": raise dots

The "w" is a bit wide.

Spacing: too tight.

The hook on your lowercase g still draws too much attention.

There are a lot of proportion issues here that you should work out first. Your stem and stroke weights are also inconsistent.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow Noah, some MAJOR improvements here. Two things that jump out at me, your "c" and "e" widths need to match more closely and the hook of your "y" doesn't work for me. I think you can go a little more ornate with your "y". All in all...great tweaking from the last showing. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">tbiddy, I've fixed the c&e and I'll post them when I've made a more substantial revision. I'm interested in your opinion on the "y". As it stands it is bland and I'm having trouble rescuing it from that fate. I've tried half a dozen variations and made one that seems a slight improvement <strong><a href="http://www.grodworks.com/temp/yy.swf" title="two y's" target="_blank">here</a></strong> but if you can think of something better feel free to post a sketch or link to an example I've no problem with visual aids :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Listen to your typeface. What I mean by that is look at the structure of your other characters to see what best matches. What I would do is look to the hook of your "g". If that doesn't work, try other parts of your characters to match a consistent flow. You're getting really close...</div>
