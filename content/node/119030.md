  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CitizenKaneEndTitleWithXanadu_4226.jpg]\r\nToday's
    movie trivia. At first I thought, \"Oh an ominous castle, must be Drarcula or
    Frankenstein. But wait ... the gate has a _K_! This is Xanadu the ill fated modern
    castle of media magnate Charles Foster Kane, played by Orson Welles in a 1941
    movie that is usually placed near the top of lists of the best movies of all time.\"\r\nIt
    would have been hand lettered.\r\nAFAIK this lettering was not made into a specific
    font.\r\nBut there are some script fonts from the era that could be substituted.
    Consider Coronet and similar fonts shown at http://www.identifont.com/similar?ID\r\nSome
    modern scripts that have a retro look somewhat similar to the lettering\r\nClaude

    end titles, but I\u2019m unable to locate it now.\r\nAlso several old threads
    on end titles and catchwords here on Typophile contain good discussions and references. "
