  I've been using the letterhead and tried to creat a new text field. When I do that

  print of the the text field with the interactive text I've added \"Dan-Project ApS\"
  ... the problem is that is getting cute in the button and I don't know why?\r\n\r\ncould
  anyone tell what i'm doing wrong?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Check to see if you have given a body size to it. It could be in "auto". Making
    text fields in pdfs is the biggest headbusting thing in this world. Good luck.
