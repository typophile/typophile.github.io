  been used too much (please, please, don't let it become another Papyrus!).\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone suggest a substitute?\r\n\r\nI'd like the same qualities of Cezanne, with
  the same or better legibility. Thanks!"

  body: "Thanks Josh. I really like the Dear-Sarah-Pro. But yikes, $119. I only need
    it for one word - I may just write it out myself!\r\n\r\nAbout P22: I like this
    foundry but am I missing the typetester? I'd like to see what my one word looks
    like but can't find where to view that from.\r\n\r\nAnybody?"
