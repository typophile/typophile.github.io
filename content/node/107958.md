  in the city of Leipzig, which has been re-constructed:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RIMG0487_1sw_6033.jpg]\r\n\r\n\u201CUntergrundmesshalle\u201D
  means Underground Trade Fair Hall. It is from 1924, appearently it was the world\u2019s
  first underground building of this kind.\r\n_\r\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t resist.\r\n\r\nI
  think this may be coming out soon:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild-grund-5_3768.png]"

    into a conventional \"Art Deco\" formula. This is a light and refreshing design
    that suggests a future of thechnological progress and achievements.\r\np.s. Happy
    you have not left Typophile.\r\nDon"

  body: "LIPSIA is the Latin Name for Leipzig. As such it is the proper and usual
    form in Italian and Spanish, in Portugese its L\xEDpsia. The actual French/English
    form is Leipsic, rather unusual nowadays."

    as Leipzig. Except for Hamburg (Hamburgo), M\xFCnchen (Munique) and K\xF6ln (Col\xF4nia),
    German cities are identified by its original names in Brazilian Portuguese."
