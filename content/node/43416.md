  having trouble trying to find the right balance and wanted some more eyes on this.
  My worry is that besides the type, there are too many visual elements trying to
  engage the eye and the line connecting figures is throwing the balance of the whole
  thing off.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some insights. The artwork is not very final, more
  of a placeholder. \r\n\r\n*Shoot the photo didn't load up. Here is the link: <a

  photo and it didn't post. any reason why?"

  body: Can't speak to the balance, but my first reaction was, is the big "i" the
    person's middle initial or is it just a stylized "i" to link the other two together,
    and is it supposed to be a microphone, a person behind a lectern, or both?

  body: I like the use of Dolly, but the lower-case "i"s are throwing me off. They
    could potentially work with the serifs cut off, but the extra tight kerning around
    them doesn't help. Usually I think logotypes should be more integrated with their
    icon if there is one, but in this instance I would rather see her name in just
    plain dolly and then create an "i" icon that mirrors some of those shapes.

  body: Also, the tagline is way too light, and will completely disappear at normal
    usage sizes.

  body: "@Feelthekern. Yeah the kerning doesn't have to be that tight. I can definitely
    give it some room to breath as there is no reason why its that tight currently.
    It's a rough draft so i'll definitely boost up the tagline.\r\n\r\n@all The big
    \"i\" could be indeed all of those, as many speaker use mics and lecterns. Currently
    it's wanting to double as a mic and symbolically a person. The lowercase \"i\"s
    were modified from the microphone in the middle and carry over the same stem width
    as the original characters.\r\n\r\nWhat i'm wrestling with is how much to keep
    and how much to kill. I'd be perfectly happy with a simple word mark and the tagline,
    but i felt like something a bit more interesting needed to happen as many word
    marks rely on simple twists, otherwise its just Dolly and Bryant. Since i wouldn't
    want to take much away from the beauty that is Dolly, even the line connecting
    two people would be possibly symbolic enough in the context of speakers connecting
    with the listeners. Though is that too simple or just enough?\r\n\r\nIf it helps
    her current audience types are primarily young African American girls and secondly
    a broader range of young people.\r\n\r\nSo many options to choose from. I'll see
    if i can work out a more hand crafted mic, lectern, person icon that matches Dolly.
    Other thoughts are most welcome.\r\n\r\n"
