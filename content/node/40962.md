body: "Good evening all... I am trying to identify a typeface used in a client's logotype.
  She tells me that it was created with Letraset type back in the 70s. It looks similar
  to Letraset Premier Light, but obviously different. Any thoughts to what it might
  be?\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\nck"

  body: Akira - Thank you so much! Its a perfect match. Only problem now is I can't
    find a source who sells it. Does anyone have a suggestion as to where I could
    purchase Fina?
