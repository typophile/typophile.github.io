  Severini - \"Cannoni in Azione (Guns in Action), 1915 - Oil on canvas. Private collection,
  copyright ADAGP, Paris.\r\n\r\nThis showed up in my mail box this morning thought
  I'd share. I can't read very much of the words but I likes BBOUMM, and the whole
  comp has a rich artistic academic lineage which I appreciate. Action words sure
  have come a long way(?).\r\n\r\nGino Severini (7 April 1883\u201326 February 1966)
  - Italian painter, graphic artist and sculptor. "

    which is the onomatop&oelig;ic sound of a one-cylinder marine motor.
