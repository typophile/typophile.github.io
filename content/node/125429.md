  body: "What you posted isn't a typeface. \r\n\r\nIn the era of moveable type (wood
    and metal), catchwords\u2014common small words such as \u201Cand\u201D and \u201Cthe\u201D\u2014were
    complete units of type that could be plugged into layouts. They were often decorative
    and/or angled (like your sample) and were used in letterhead and headline design.\r\n\r\nSearching
    MyFonts using the term \u201Ccatchwords\u201D will turn up dozens of digital typefaces
    that might include something similar.\r\n"
