body: Can anyone tell me what the two fonts in this image are? The first one appears
  to be an Italic version of Futura, but I'm not 100% sure as it could be some other
  modern style font such as Verlag. Hoping y'all can help on both!

    Medium Italic]]</strong>\r\n\r\nThe second one looks customized to me (not a real
    font), \r\nespecially the /R and maybe the /?"
