  on tee shirts? Or do I have to buy different ink?\r\n\r\nI feel silly."

    between textile and paper water-based screenprinting ink, but nothing so substantial
    that you couldn't do it just to recover the ink. As far as water-based goes, it
    lacks the opacity of Plastisol inks\u2014which are acrylic-based\u2014and cures
    itself. So you've got to move a little faster with it. It'll work though, its
    worth a shot. But yes, there are water-based screen-printing inks that textile
    printers use all the time. A lot nicer to breathe. \r\n\r\nI will say that i've
    had problems crossing plastisol emulsion with water-based inks and vice versa.

  body: "Am I right to assume that by water-based inks, you mean waterborne acrylic
    emulsion that is waterproof when dry, right? Not a soluble gum based paint like
    gouache or poster tempera?\r\n\r\nIf that is the case it should be compatible
    with most brands of artists acrylic paints and inks. You may need to add an elastic
    medium to prevent it from cracking on garments. Ceramcoat Textile Medium is good
    if you are producing a relatively small volume. It's available at craft stores.
    For larger volumes I'm sure a commercial silkscreen supply house can provide an
    equivalent. Of course adding clear acrylic medium of any kind will increase transparency
    of the inks, so this is generally only a viable solution on white shirts."

  body: Poster ink is thinner than textile ink. You'll get an image but it won't be
    very opaque (speaking from experience).

    masochist, sit there with a towel and an iron to cure every shirt. '
