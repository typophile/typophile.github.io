  body: I've always preferred Ludlow's Cheltenham swash characters, which is unusual.
    I tend to like ATF's versions of things in most cases.

    far as I know, Ludlow only did these cursive caps, no lowercase variants."

  body: "interesting. your ludlow swashes look like they've been designed to be non-kerning,
    similar to some bb&s swash caps that i put in the OT version of <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/caslon.html\">LTC
    Caslon</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bbscaswsh.gif]"

  body: Paul - Yes, I think Bookman is both oversaturated and dated. Cheltenham swashes
    are certainly antique, but I think the face would be more useful and relevant.
