  body: "I looked for this at MyFonts and Dafont. This could come from anywhere, including
    custom designed for Gamestation. It's the sort of font that can be easily created
    by anyone who can scribble letters. My advice is search Script>Trash category
    at Dafont for something close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
