  body: my mother&#39;s a 3rd grade teacher and i believe she uses the school house
    fonts tiff linked to above. i think their font pack even comes with some nifty
    software that links the cursive together as it would in handwriting. I&#39;ve
    used these b4 and they seem to be just like all those handwriting books i went
    through in gradeschool.
