  going for my MFA in GR and still exploring but so far typography has been my favorite
  part. I'm still learning and would love to know more typefaces other than the common
  ones (as they are also tabooed in our department) I'm currently creating a mood
  board for a project in my type class and wanted some help in picking typefaces.
  The topic is a personal museum and I'm leaning towards a museum that displays the
  work of the UN and perhaps some snapshots from the developing countries to raise
  awareness and get more people to help. When I think of the UN conceptually I tend
  to think clean san serif typeface reflecting the pillars of the UN's work and how
  the sleek stems reflect the pillars which are the fundamental part of a building
  in this case, foundation. But also, when I think of it conceptually I think of serif
  as being roots of a tree that grows and produces something beautiful which in this
  case is people's help. I don't know if I'm thinking about it too much, but I would
  love some feedback, and type suggestions if that's possible. :) Thank you!\r\n\r\nD"

    Try Helvetica Condensed. It's Sleek and Simple.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    suggest not using Helvetica Condensed. \r\n\r\nTry spending some time at Fontshop
    or Myfonts and test out different typefaces. It would break from the mold to use
    a serif face (or, for that matter, anything that isn't a geometric sans), for
    a museum identity. \r\n\r\nThat's my 2\xA2"

  body: Thanks for the response! I'm actually creating the museum's entire identity.
    A series of things including a book, posters and some of the things you find in
    a museum's gift shop. So I'll probably need to find more than one typeface (at
    least 3) for headlines, subheads and body text. Thanks guys.
