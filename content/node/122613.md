  own design studio soon. I'm about to buy a printer for proofing purposes but can't
  decide which printer will suit my needs. I work a lot with typography and illustrations
  in books, flyers, etc. so full colour and fine printing is a must. At this moment
  I don't have much money to spend so I had my eye on the Xerox 6600DN. Does anybody
  know if this printer is good enough for proofing purposes?"

    in color\", or proofing as in \"this is in Pantone 295 but maybe Pantone 296 looks
    better\"?\r\n\r\nAs with everything else, ultimately you get what you pay for."

    want to see samples from, then order a Test Drive from them for $19.95. You provide
    the test files of your choice.\r\n\r\nI did that when I bought my color laser
    and was really surprised at how bad text looks on some of the big-name brands
    you might think would be the best. I ended up buying a Ricoh because the quality
    on 12-point type was excellent and it has true Postscript 3. The Ricoh black-and-white
    lasers use a Postscript emulator. Doing a Test Drive saved me from making an expensive
    mistake.\r\n"
