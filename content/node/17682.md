  written down how you would say them eg Go to the bottom of x road, turn left. Take
  a right along the enbankment etc.\r\n\r\nI dont want to just have it as an ordinary
  paragraph and as there is no higherarchy for headers/pull quotes etc im looking
  for other ideas to make it more interesing?\r\n\r\nI was thinking along the lines
  of using // instead of full stops or dingbat arrows?\r\n\r\nAnyone done anything
  similar or any ideas?"

    href=\"http://rally-speed.tripod.com/Technic.htm\">rally roadbook</a>, if it slightly
    less important to have the directions as useable as that, you could do a 'map'
    with the directions following the roads from the top left corner to bottom right.\r\nTim"

    X ROAD was supposed to be in small caps, but Typophile doesn't support the \"small\"
    tag.)"
