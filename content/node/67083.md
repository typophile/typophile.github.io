body: Which embedding schemes make use of composites? When I use Cufon on an all caps
  font where the lowercase is made of composites it doesn't reduce the file size.
  How about other web font embedding schemes? Which ones take advantage of composites
  and which ones end up decomposing them?

    Do we really still need to decompose all of our Postscript fonts to get them to
    work as composites? Is it really safe to use them in TrueType fonts? Will using
    them in web fonts even make a difference if the fonts are being compressed with
    gzip when they become WOFF files?'

  body: "CFF fonts do not use composites natively. PS fonts use subroutinisation for
    outline optimisation. This is a font generation-time option in FL and other tools.
    So yes, if you are building FontLab projects using composites, you need to set
    the option to decompose during font generation and, if desired, use subroutinisation.\r\n\r\nTTF
    fonts do use composites natively, i.e. the TT glyf table uses composites in much
    the same way as they are defined within FontLab. Composites inherit hinting from
    base glyphs, so they are a useful way not only to reduce the size of the font
    but also to reduce the hinting workload. [I recommend against scaling, strethcing,
    flipping or otherwise manipulating composites -- other than shifting x,y position
    -- as possible in FontLab, though, as this seems to cause rendering problems.]
    In recent years, I've started to quite regularly see fonts including glyphs made
    up of overlapping components, e.g. a /Ccedilla/ glyph in which a /C/ base component
    and /cedilla/ mark component are used, rather than these being decomposed and
    the outlines merged. I guess this indicates that the makers of these fonts have
    sufficient faith in the current state of TT rasterisers, and consider poential
    problems associated with overlapping contours to be obsolete concerns."

    composites make any difference in other web embedding schemes?  It certainly seems
    to make no difference in Cufon. But I don't know for certain if Cufon decomposes
    . . . I'm not sure how it works.\r\n\r\nWhat about EOT and EOT Lite? Are composites
    retained or are they collapsed?\r\n\r\nSifr?"

    right.\r\n\r\n<em>What about EOT and EOT Lite? Are composites retained or are

    the internal compression in EOT (and WOFF for that matter) can nearly revert the
    increase in size. Similar repeating data structures compress very well."
