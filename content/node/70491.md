body: "I have a problem when I export text, and especially footnotes, from word (2003)
  to pdf.\r\nYou can see the problem in these screenshots (taken from the exported
  pdf):\r\n\r\nhttp://users.auth.gr/gtrianta/images/problem1.png\r\nhttp://users.auth.gr/gtrianta/images/problem2.png\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is these tag-like characters that appear with the footnote reference in
  the text and also the footnote number at the bottom of the page. I guess there are
  some sort of tags that word uses to make the footnote reference a link to the actual
  footnote when you read the text in word. Is there a way to avoid having these marks
  printed when you export the text in pdf?\r\n\r\nAnother problem (again with the
  footnotes) is shown in the following screenshot:\r\n\r\nhttp://users.auth.gr/gtrianta/images/problem3.png\r\n\r\nThe
  problem here is that when exporting the text in pdf, a number is added before the
  footnote separator as if it is a \"Heading 1\" styled text. The same number appears
  before every footnote separator.\r\n\r\nAny help will be highly appreciated.\r\nThanks
  you in advance."

  body: "This can happen if you used PDFMaker. The TPF and FPT are footnote markers
    that apparently get inserted by PDFMaker. I've found a number of PDFs on the web
    that have them in ZWAdobeF 1 point font. If you have Acrobat, print your document
    to a .ps file and then distill the .ps file.\r\n\r\nI suspect the heading style
    being applied to the footnote separator is also due to PDFMaker. However, the
    footnote separator might have picked up a hyperlink or other cross reference.
    Go into Normal view and open the footnote separator for editing; look for any
    field codes or whatever (you might have to set up your options to view field codes).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.acrobatusers.com/forums/aucbb/viewtopic.php?id=18320"
