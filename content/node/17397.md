  body: looking closer at it, i see quite a few things i would want to change. does
    anyone know where i can find a [[EULA]] for [[dstype]]? I didn't find one on myfonts.
    do they show that kind of thing before downloading?

    play with it. When I get home, I will look for the EULA (which I assume came as
    part of the download).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "In my untutored view, the faces from dstype are uniformly well thought out
    and professionally executed. I own several, including Esta and Quaestor.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to 'Esta', I also find a few things I'd like to tweak, but overall impression
    is a more decorative text face with many options for setting.  Somebody must like
    it, it's one of the bestselling faces on myfonts.\r\n\r\nSurely could use an OT
    version. The text weights, to my eye, set a little light on a desktop postscript
    printer, haven't had time for production runs. IMHO, the  regular text weight
    ampersand could be less linear to conform to the overall flavor.\r\n\r\nNo EULA
    came with pkg., nor is one immediately apparent at the web site.\r\n\r\nHope this
    helps.\r\n\r\nJohn"

    done a great deal with it yet, I missed small caps ligatures but then you can't
    have everything.\r\nTim"

  body: well to start with, i'd give it the OT treatment. i don't care abt small cap
    ligs, but i didn't notice any italic ligs. lastly, there are a few characters
    that i would redraw. but all this is if the EULA would allow it.

  body: "Hi, Paul:\r\nMyfonts usually gives a link to the EULA from the \"purchase
    options\" page. Have a look at dstype's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/viewlicense?id=347\">here.</a>
    It stipulates no mods without permission. Of, course, there's nothing to say you
    couldn't get permission."
