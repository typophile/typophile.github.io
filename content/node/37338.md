  specifically what general type sizes are required for reading at certain distances?\r\n\r\nI
  need to design a billboard and I'm not sure how small I can go with the type, yet
  still have it be readable from say 50 yards.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    quoted;\r\n\"As to size, I believe ADA guidelines specify 1 inch of cap height
    for every 50 ft of viewing distance.(I know this is what FHWA has built their
    spec on).\"\r\n\r\nI also remember using this guideline back in my days in the
    sign business. You might want to use a size larger than that formula provides,
    since a billboard needs to be read from a moving vehicle, which is considerably
    more difficult than reading while standing still.\r\n\r\nJason C"

    driver looks at a billboard for about three seconds. With that in mind, you should
    keep it simple and readable. Don't put to much information on it.\r\n\r\nCheers!

  body: "I just did 11 billboards for a campaign in New Jersey. 15 words. They range
    from 14' x 36' (signage companies always do the dimensions backwards - at least
    for me) to 16' x 60'.\r\n\r\nI would estimate that the main letters (a band name
    in Franklin Gothic Condensed or Extra Condensed) are 8' to 14' tall (depending
    on the board size).\r\n\r\nThe other words are probably around 2' to 5' tall.\r\n\r\nThey
    are done to scale in Illustrator (1/48 to 1/12 scale depending on the vendor)
    so you can get there with point size. I have done them full size and then you
    have to set the type and scale it - 1200 points - I believe that's the limit in
    our software - is not large enough.\r\n\r\npbc"
