  Vancouver Island. I am vacationing here (and doing a bit of work), and wanted to
  see about meeting people. I started a Meetup group and everything.  :)\r\n\r\nThinking
  of having a small get-together next week!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Type-Victoria-Fonts-Typography-meetup/"

  body: Thomas, it isn't Vancouver Island, but you do know that Tiro Typeworks is
    supposed to be just across in Vancouver, right? It's been 50 years since I was
    up that way, but back then it wasn't toooo bad a trip...

    there's a Type Camp workshop happening in Vancouver on June 28 \u2013 maybe you
    can splice into those guys and gals. You can also ask Working Format. Lastly,
    it's not a crazy drive up from Seattle, and there's a bunch of font-heads there,
    so...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Many well-known typographers and type designers live on the gulf islands,
    so much that they have been nicknamed the \u201CTypographic Archipelago.\u201D
    John Hudson is on Gabriola Island, Ross Mills and Shelley Gruendler on Galliano
    Island, Marian Bantjes on Bowen Island, and Robert Bringhurst on Quadra Island.\r\n\r\nVancouver
    is quite a ways from Victoria, btw. What with needing to wait for the ferry, it
    is nearly a three hour trip all told, although only half of that is ferry transit
    time per se. Seattle with its faster catamaran service, right from downtown, combined
    with minimal wait times, is effectively nearly as close."

    Makes sense.  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
