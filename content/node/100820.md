  body: "Jan, do you think a person -especially a recent arrival- could be forgiven
    for the following, based on your second post:\r\n- Thinking that Typophile is
    OK with some people pirating fonts, so it's OK to ask?\r\n- Providing a link on
    Typophile of where to download Rosewood Fill for free?\r\n- Thinking -based on
    the neutrality of your question- that you want to find a free source yourself?\r\n\r\nI'm
    personally confident that you're not a font pirate, but do you think incorrect
    perceptions of people and places can cause trouble? Do you feel that everybody
    makes mistakes, but it's good to try to make amends? Do you think we're all in
    this together whether we like it or not, or are we just individuals with nothing
    in common?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
