		<div class="commentbody">&#62;&#34;Unfortunately however, sales of font software for Precision Type and many others companies in the font business have been adversely affected in recent years by a growing supply of free font software via the Internet.&#34; &#40;From Precision Type&#39;s announcement&#41; <BR> <BR>Is that really the case? <BR> <BR>Possible culprits: <BR> <BR>1. Free fonts: bundled with applications &#40;Adobe&#41; <BR>2. Free fonts: with operating sytems &#40;Apple, Microsoft&#41; <BR>3. Free fonts: Freefonts.com, etc. <BR>4. Cheap font collections: Adobe, Bitstream, Corel  <BR>5. Pirated fonts: online p2p <BR>6. Pirated fonts:  b2b  <BR>7. Online competition: mega-stores &#40;Myfonts, Fonts.com&#41; <BR>8. Online competition: proliferation of online foundries and distributors <BR>9. Competition in general: eg Veer&#39;s DM &#43; online <BR>10. Product selection. <BR> <BR>On this last point, it may be that Precision Type had over-associated itself with foundries &#40;see list on its obituary page&#41; that started out as &#34;wholesale suppliers&#34;, but subsequently ramped up their &#34;factory sales&#34; internet activity to become much stronger competitors.  <BR></div>

They are also illegal in many countries, in contravention of &#34;Fair Business Practice&#34;, but the authorities are not going after the font perp&#39;s, their #1 target is Microsoft -- as with the recent EU fine of Microsoft for bundling other software with its OS.   <BR> <BR>Here is a section from the Canadian Competition Act, &#34;Offences in Relation to Competitiion&#34;: <BR> <BR>50. &#40;1&#41; Every one engaged in a business who <BR> <BR>&#40;c&#41; engages in a policy of selling products at prices unreasonably low, having the effect or tendency of substantially lessening competition or eliminating a competitor, or designed to have that effect, <BR> <BR>is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. <BR> <BR>This is an &#34;anti-dumping&#34; law, which would apply to bundling free software, but as with many things digital, there appears to be a different standard as to what businesses can get away with. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, <BR> <BR>There is a pretty huge difference between Microsoft&#39;s bundling web browsers and media players in their operating system, and other folks bundling fonts with their applications. Among other things, I doubt you&#39;ll find folks engaged in font bundling writing notes to each other about how the small type foundries must have their air supply cut off. <BR> <BR>I rather suspect that making false public allegations that somebody is breaking the law can get you in trouble. I don&#39;t know whether your current comments are libellous. I also don&#39;t know how much of a defence ignorance is against a libel lawsuit. I just think you should be a little more careful. <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t a threat or anything: even if I was personally ticked off enough to talk to our lawyers, I doubt Adobe would bother with this sort of nonsense. But you&#39;re making pretty broad blanket statements, and some folks in the type industry are much more aggressive in their legal activities than Adobe is. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting point. I do know many european countries prohibit the selling of a product at a loss to cut the competition out. <BR> <BR>Of course, in the US, we don&#39;t really care about that &#40;in the legal sense&#41; and let businesses get away with that.  <BR> <BR>The big issue with digital media, though, is that the cost of replication/distribution can be argued at being close to nothing. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Also, did Precision Type ever offer online ordering and downloading of fonts?</i> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s been four years since I worked for a company that was a reseller for Precision Type &#40;Beowulf in St. Paul&#41;. At that time they sent us several CDs with all their fonts. We&#39;d send a P.O. for the font we wanted and they&#39;d send us a code to unlock the font. We could then e-mail the fonts to our buyers. At the time it seemed speedy! <BR> <BR>I use their book often when trying to track down unfamiliar typefaces. However, it&#39;s much easier just to post a sample here on the identification board. The speed of responses here is just amazing! <BR> <BR>kristin <BR></div>
