    in case you missed it):\r\n... was set with types of D. Stempel AG FaM and historic
    faces taken from that foundry's archive ..."

  body: "You might think it would be a typeface designed by Herr Zapf, but at least
    it was not any of his works that I had in any of my books.\r\n\r\nI also notice
    that when you look at the rest of that page the other type on the page has a different
    W; also the large sample does not show a J, which is a key letter for me.\r\n\r\nI
    searched with these letters in the Serif Font ID Guide but found no matches in
    the almost 1,300 families we have catalogued so far.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I've not seen the book, but this strikes me as a lettering sample. Hermann
    Zapf, being a master calligrapher, could fool most of us.

    D looks quite zapfish to me though. Palatino, Optima, Edison, Aldus, Aurelia,
    Orion and Sistina have similar features. "

  body: "I don't know what it is, but it certainly isn't a Hermann Zapf <em>typeface</em>.
    It is possible that he lettered the drawing, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nThere are
    many non-Zapf Stempel faces in the book. It must be one of the typefaces that
    Stempel had in its back catalog. The book was a marketing instrument not just
    for Hermann Zapf (and the typefaces he designed for Stempel while he was their
    art director), but for the company as a whole."

  body: "So the book does not identify the type samples shown in it? Wouldn't that
    be odd for a 'marketing instrument'?\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I skimmed through
    the Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces' and this was not shown there either.
    I think I have run out of places to check in my library. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    this index was? I scrolled through all the pages of the book shown on your site,
    and failed to notice anything that seemed like an index to the typefaces used.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Mike, there are 100 specimen pages numeroted followed by an epilog by Paul
    Standard, then three pages of complete index, with pages, writers and fonts used.
    I shall photography oneday these pages, but the book is very rare and I try to
    take care of it ;-) //p
