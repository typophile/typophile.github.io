body: a geometric sans like Avenir or Avant Garde. They have similar geometric foundations
  so I'm thinking either is a pretty good match for a headline/body copy relationship.
  Thoughts?

  body: "I'm currently working on a branding project using Lubalin Graph in the logo,
    and although I'm not completely decided, have been playing with serifs (such as
    Century Schoolbook) for use as a secondary/body copy font.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm
    taking the opposing view in that similar can be to much, but opposites sometimes
    attract.\r\nAlthough of course it depends on the context in which they are being
    used. "

  body: "Well, not body in terms of book layout, but a stationary system. I think
    the legibility of either is sufficient for this use.\r\n\r\nAnd to clarify, Lubalin
    Graph (slab serif). I wasn't aware there was a sans. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    feedback. Much appreciated."
