  body: "The effect is custom. Note how the angled cut rises with each of the ten
    letters in the word.\r\nSo pick a heavy sans of your choice and apply a diminishing
    angled cut one letter after another to form the word you want to make with this
    effect.\r\nfor example, ITC Franklin Std black: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/franklin/std-black/\r\nDon\r\n"
