  body: "Reminds me of F. H. Ernst Schneidler's  \"Schneidler-Mediaeval mit Initialen\"
    aka Schneidler Initials released in 1936. But manually widened and with some editing
    cvhanges: clipping the tip on the bottom rhs of _N_, replacing the leg on _R_
    and widening the bowl, clipping the stem on the bottom rhs of _U_. \r\nCompare
    the image to the Schneidler Initials digitized by Jason Castle \r\nas Sh\xE0ng\xF3

  body: "But the serifs are closer to Copperplate, so I suppose this is another font
    or perhaps an adaptation of Copperplate or an expanded width version of NiveauSerifLight,
    with the leg on _R_ replaced etc. \r\nHere is NiveauSerifLight\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NiveauSerifLightAsCONSTRUCTIONS_4272.gif]
