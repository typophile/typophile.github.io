  uses for their new Valentine's Day ads.  Does anyone know what font they used and
  if so - can it be used by the general public??\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Valentine_4366.gif]"

  body: "It's like Perpetua Light, if there were such a thing. Hmm, the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lapidary-333/|Bistream
    version]] is still too heavy. \r\n\r\nYou know that outrage we can do by adding
    white stroke to thin the typeface? Or some other graphic 'massaging'? It just
    seems to be too much like Perpetua to be anything else.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    in \"l\", \"n\" and \"i\" on a perfect horizontal, as well as rounding the bowl
    of \"a\". To make myself perfectly clear, this is what Perpetua would have looked
    like \u2014 just compare.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/valentine_5546.gif]"

  body: "Well, yes, that could be done by someone good with outline manipulating.
    I'm not advocating it, but I think you see my point about how much this resembles
    Perpetua. There is another Gill face called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/aries/|Aries]]
    that is also similar, but less so.\r\n\r\nIn truth, having some idea of the artists
    available to Tiffany's, I wouldn't be surprised if someone working for them drew
    the word by hand, to make a more elegant version of those Perpetua letters. It's
    easy to forget how many skilled lettering artists are still around, although some
    of them are regulars here.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines I was hoping to find that
    Dennis Ortiz-Lopez had done a Light Perpetua, but I could not find that among
    the types shown on [[http://www.ortiz-lopez.com/|his site]]. He has done this
    for several other classic typefaces, but I didn't see this one. \r\n\r\n- Mike
