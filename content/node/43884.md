  a forum (on any subject) it seems friendlier here than most. For some reason forums
  often tend to be ripe with egos and spiteful people. Maybe it's the anonymity.\r\n\r\nSo
  anyway, yesterday I expressed my 'sympathy' for Typophile. I'm not blowing my own
  trumpet (it was only about \xA37 after all). I just want to know if I can now plop
  the little shield top-left onto my avatar. I didn't get any email confirmation other
  than the PayPal receipt. I don't want to be rude. Can I just leave it there forever?
  It was a once-off payment.\r\n"

    patience. ;-)
