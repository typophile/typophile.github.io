  body: "Dimitri,\r\nAre you sure that you posted your thread correctly? I don't believe
    that your thread would have been removed as there is a strong understanding by
    the moderators not to do such things generally. If your thread had been removed,
    there would have been some discussion (amongst us moderators) and you would have
    been notified. This leads me to conclude that there was probably some other problem
    with your thread besides it being removed. I'll look further into this and post
    back to you."
