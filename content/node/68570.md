body: "I'm designing some preliminary styles for a website that revolves around people
  watching/chatting about television. The audience is teenagers and college kids and
  I want it to be fun without being too corny. I also want to avoid the standard retro
  1950s Golden Age tv stuff. \r\n\r\nOne font I've been playing with is Chalet NY
  1980. Any other suggestions?"
