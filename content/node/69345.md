  body: "That looks like a built-in printer font, but FontFont has some under the
    heading of \"Ironic\" fonts. I like this description, because it means using computer
    digital fonts to look like something non-digital. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-luggagetag/one/\">FF
    Luggagetag One</a> looks the most similar, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
