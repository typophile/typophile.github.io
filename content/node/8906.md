body: '<I>I received this email recently. Can we help this person find some answers
  to his questions? -jb</I> <BR> <BR>Respected Sir <BR>  <BR>Our language Malayalam
  has got more than 900 unique characters. &#40;It is one of the national languages
  of India, spoken by 30 million people of Kerala, the southern most state in India&#41;.
  <BR>  <BR>25 years ago we had cut short our mother chrs to 90 to accommodate in
  typewriters. Since then we followed these chrs in printing and computers. <BR>  <BR>Two
  years back we started a linguistic movement &#40;non-profitable&#41; to resurrect
  our lost chrs in typesetting, because our  original chrs were functionally superior
  and aesthetically more beautiful. The movement is called RACHANA which means &#39;graceful,
  Divine  Writing&#39;. <BR>  <BR>We designed two typefaces using Fontographer. Each
  typeface consists of 6 ttf files to accommodate all the 900 chrs. We programmed
  an editor called Rachana. With Rachana all the conjuncts can be made by combining
  basic keys. <BR>  <BR>Rachana is slowly spreading. So far 6 books have been published
  by different publishers. <BR>  <BR>Now, we would like to have your expert opinion
  on the following: <BR>  <BR>1&#41; Can we accommodate all the 900 chrs in a SINGLE
  ttf file? I have noticed that some of the windows fonts &#40;New times Roman, Arial,
  Tahoma&#41; have more than 1500 slots. How these fonts with extended chrs are made?
  <BR>  <BR>2&#41; If we are successful in making fonts with the above structure,
  can we use it in Adobe PageMaker? &#40;Because 90% of the DTP centers are using
  this package for final layout&#41; <BR>  <BR>3&#41; Is the font structure of Linux
  based on 16 bit chr? <BR>  <BR>We would be indebted for your reply. <BR>  <BR>Thanking
  in anticipation, <BR>  <BR>Hussain <BR>Documentation Officer <BR>Kerala Forest Research
  Institute <BR>Kerala, India <BR>  <BR>hussain@kfri.org'

  body: 'Is the &#91;original&#93; Malayalam writing system in Unicode? If no, you
    have to make your own &#34;standard&#34; encoding. Are the 900 glyphs actually
    variants of the 90 &#40;either contextual or aesthetic&#41;? If so, you should
    consider OpenType technology. In which case, I don&#39;t know about PageMaker
    or Linux, but it should be implementable through InDesign. <BR> <BR>BTW, try these:
    <BR>1. The OpenType list: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otlist.htm"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otlist.htm</A> <BR>2.
    Qalam: <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/qalam/" TARGET="_top">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/qalam/</A>
    <BR> <BR>Anyway, great project - best wishes on preserving/reviving your culture.
