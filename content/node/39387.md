    fits the bill, but that was sort of the point. Less blatantly, nobody really ever
    gripes or gushes over Adobe Caslon, but it gets used constantly. "

    a fairly ubiquitous font. However, I\u2019ve mostly heard really good things about
    it. Perhaps another type better fits the bill. One that I\u2019ve used <i>very</i>
    often in projects I have not designed but have worked on as the layout artist
    on groups of projects years apart, and for different clients, is New Baskerville."

    vote Morris Fuller Benton, the king of boring average workhorses."

    35 typefaces, they are widely distributed and well-known. Both are legible, but
    few would ever choose either as the first typeface that comes to mind for ANY
    job. Yet, if used, it's a perfectly AVERAGE and adequate choice.\r\n\r\nBecause
    Bookman has a bit too much individual flair, I'll vote for the latter.\r\n"

  body: When i read this question i tought not about a neutral type, instead i elected
    the one i believe is above all the neutral types, but not good enough to be "the
    one". Guess for me average means the best type for general use, and for me it
    is Agro Sans - simple, white and beautyfully versatile.

  body: Arial might be totally "average" or "invisible" on office documents, but in
    a context like a wedding invitation, 36 pt. Arial Bold would look pretty odd.
    The idea of what's invisible to type people and what's invisible to the average
    reader are two very different things -- Zapf Chancery would probably look great
    on a wedding invitation to the non-designer.

    is not going to be bothered by the micro-detailed problems in Arial. Whether or
    not these impact their reading speed and/or comprehension is an entirely different
    debate, but it's not going to be consciously noticed at least.
