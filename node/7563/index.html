  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So, there's a videogame called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Half-Life 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Its interface uses what appears to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FF DIN Light<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I'm a huge fan of both. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, as most fans of a game or movie are inclined to do, they want to get their hands on the font. Being the foolish typophile that I am, I chastised the people running the site for allowing font piracy on their site, while they berate game piracy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's a response I got from a fan on the site: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->as for &quot;the amount of effort it takes to make a font&quot; please.. dont make me laugh. Making a font is EASY. There are fonts out there that cost thousands of dollars, just so you have the right to use it publicly, its a joke. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fonts are not hard to make, stop kidding yourself. and FF DIN is a very basic looking font, clean lines, nothing fancy. I bet it didnt take long to make at all. It would be like me making signatures for people and charging them $1500 a go.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've already blasted him for his ignorance and explained (briefly) that he's wrong, but what I'd like to know is if anyone here knows how long <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albert Jan-Pool<!-- raw HTML omitted -->'s FF DIN <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> took to make? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is why people pirate fonts. Why non-designers do. I'm just throwing fists against the castle walls in an attempt to change maybe one of their minds.</div>

But it was my second outline font - I can do it a bit faster now. But not in an hour, like those guys probably think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've never made a font, and I've only made small promotional games, but I'm guessing that a game like half-life 2 would have taken many many times more hours than FF Din. I haven't checked the prices of either, but I would guess that FF Din costs more than a copy of half-life 2. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But its not really about the hours, is it? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You would assume that game designers feel that their role is a creative one, and probably the programmers do too. Designing and creating a typeface is also a creative role. The cost of both products includes a premium for the creativity of their designers. The size of the potential market is also a factor, as well as the composition of that market in terms of individuals or businesses. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are so many other factors that determine the price of a product that to reduce it to how many hours it took to create is irrelevant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now Mr. 'FF DIN is a very basic looking font' has to answer the question: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If it didn't take very long, and its easy, why did he want to steal someone else's work instead of just knocking up a clean, basic font himself?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it looks like they're only posting the font resource that comes with the game files anyway, which I believe doesn't have a complete character set. So, while that's not great, it's not terrible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My little tirade on the site was meant to be an indirect heads-up to the site moderators to cover their asses and quash any piracy, but we'll see. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ironically, Half-Life 2 can cost from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->$55<!-- raw HTML omitted --> up to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->$80<!-- raw HTML omitted --> depending on which version you get via retail outlets (the collector's version has all sorts of goodies). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another interesting note, Valve, the developer, is spearheading a new online content distribution method called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steam<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. On this platform, there's a $90 version. The interesting part is that it's an actual application that runs on your machine. You actually have to have a web connection to activate their products which is done via an application on your PC. A bit of remote DRM on their part. Considering how open these gamers are to letting Valve crawl onto their PCs and control their software, and the amount of $$$ it takes to get a PC to even play the game decently, I'm surprised they're so defensive about $40.</div>
