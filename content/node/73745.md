  in FontStudio?\r\nStarting from a current font like Frutiger Extrabold and then
  get the distortions over it without needing for hours and hours?\r\n\r\nThanks a
  lot\r\nStefan"

    RENDER &gt; CLOUDS, PASTE the results INTO selected type, save then Auto-trace
    in FontLab...'

    repeat. Rescan. Autotrace. Tweak. \r\n\r\nOr use any one of a number of photoshop
    filters like the Mr Retro series. But that's not as fun. "

  body: "There\u2019s no fast or simple way to do it because most of the time that
    goes into distressed type is spent cleaning up damage done during distressing
    to make letters legible and fixing the errors introduced by autotracing. If you
    do the distressing by hand you\u2019ll also have to spend time reshaping the letters
    because the distressing process tends to warp and stretch the paper. \r\n\r\nDistressing
    manually with drybrushing and sandpaper will average 10\u201320 minutes per character.
    If you use Photoshop, the Mr. Retro Machine Wash filters, do cleanup with a Wacom
    Tablet, and autotrace with ScanFont you can get this process down to about five
    minutes of work per character. \r\n\r\nI still have all this stuff set up from
    when I did <a href=\"http://www.dunwichtype.com/?page_id=45\">Black Monday</a>
    if you\u2019re interested in contracting this out."
