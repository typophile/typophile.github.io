  first version of the symbol is a quieter one and resembles a comet:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HDFlogo_3413.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  second one adds more sparkle, but feels flashy (and masonic?):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HDFlogo1_5668.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts? Thanks you!"

    is a good association.\r\nI like the second one (and \"flashy\" goes well with
    \"happy\").\r\nOne thing you could try is less star and more sun.\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DIN_4844-2_Warnung_vor_Laserstrahl_D-W010.svg"

  body: "Yes, the second one. In the first one the joy is too timid/weak, and remains
    enclosed and contained within the dark \"D\". In the second it breaks free. Seems
    really very good.\r\n(I don't see a masonic connection?)\r\n\r\nOther things:\r\n-
    The mark might be too small compared to the type below.\r\n- The italic type seems
    possibly a bit too big compared to the \xABHAPPYDAYS\xBB.\r\n- The \xABHAPPYDAYS\xBB
    will eventually benefit from a bit of kerning love."

  body: "In fact, I'm very agree according by altaira and riccardO said, with the
    second alternative of your star, but specially in that of size of \"foundation\"
    and I guess your \"H\" of your logo have the same size of the \"HAPPYDAYS\", so
    I would like to see the comparision between both alternative sizes, that current
    and such one were the image logo was a little bit grow and italic very small than
    CAPITAL phrase.\r\n\r\nJust for be a better perspective.\r\n=)\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nPS:
    and sorry for my messy english ever."

  body: "Thank you! As always, great comments.\r\n\r\nI will try to play with the
    sizes, like you suggested (although I'm pretty fond of the same-point-size for
    all the three elements as it is now). Now that you all pointed it out, it's obvious
    to me you are right about the timid laser-sun in the first example. Ricard0, I
    will try to sunny the star.\r\n\r\nI'll also pay more attention to the kerning
    and post the results."

  body: "OK. I can't work it into a sun in this concept without making the symbol
    too complicated. But I'm happy with the star-light.\r\n\r\nHere is the logo with
    more attention to kerning:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3688.
    HDsamesize.gif]\r\n\r\nNext, I've made the \"foundation\" smaller:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6064.
    HDsmall3.gif]\r\n\r\nFinally, I've also enlarged the mark:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4671.
    HDbig1small3.gif]\r\n\r\nConceptually, \"foundation\" is quite important, as they'll
    be communicating mostly to raise money, so number 1 seems most appropriate to
    me. On the other hand, as it is not part of the name, perhaps it should be smaller,
    as in number 2. In the 3rd version the symbol just seems too bold. But if treated
    in a lighter color, it might just balance with the black text.\r\n\r\nFor now,
    I'd go with 1 or 2. Thank you again for your competent comments."

    bigger logo in #3, but agree that in its current state it's a bit too dark."

    10, I first tasted a banana. Believe me, that logo has a whole lot of flavor to
    me. I think I had the sticker on my grandparents' door frame for a long time.\r\n\r\nChildhood

  body: Haha, nice. I also have pleasant memories tied to Dole. Growing up, my dad
    always chopped peaches and put them in a plastic bag with a sprinkle of sugar
    as my dessert in my bagged lunch. Oh how I miss bagged lunches.
