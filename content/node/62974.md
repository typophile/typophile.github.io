body: "There is a font that we are using for all of a clients communications. It is
  a very thin hairline, so has been used with a fine stroke added to increase thickness.
  \r\n\r\nI now want to recreate this font with the increased thickness so others
  can use it without needing to add the stroke. Is there any easy way to adjust the
  font in FL5?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    designer to interpolate a slightly heavier version for you, which would provide
    better results than bolding the design.

    an expanded path of 4 units and using the bold effect set to 4 units?\r\n\r\n@
    James - if there was time and budget I'd definitely do it that way, but it's not
    a large job."
