  body: In a time when everything seemed so new that nobody was sure how to fit it
    together, there was such a thing as "computer camp". My best guess is that this
    is a remnant of one of those.

  body: I think the sign maker intended hilarity. So many times the fonts used on
    these kinds of signs are either rugged or meant to suggest a rustic sensibility,
    which is meant to be closer to nature. Really though that stuff is just more human
    culture & is not closer to nature than say ... helvetica or any other font. So
    why not push back?

  body: It looks like the beginning of a game. You can pick up the rocks at the bottom
    of the sign, put them in your inventory and start walking the trail. Be very careful,
    there might be enemy's all around, so keep one rock in your hand!!!

    looks like it would be in the last scene, just beyond the opening credits.\r\n\r\nWhere
