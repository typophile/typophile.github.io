  and added a ramen bowl in its place. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/37649.jpg"

  body: That looks so 70s. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call it an improvement, when
    the first one wasn&#39;t so great to begin with...

    is just a representation of his smile from making money hand over fist. '

  body: Ramen bowl... hahaha. <BR> <BR>but... <BR> <BR>&#40;grrrr... still have trouble
    posting images. I was trying to do a side-by-side comparison with the ubiquitous
    <a href="http://abc.go.com/">ABC</a> logo.&#41; <BR> <BR>Inferiority complex?

  body: I think its a step in a better direction. <BR>As ambiguous as it may be, it
    definately leaves <BR>the identity open for growth, and futher/later definement,
    if that makes sense. <BR> <BR>Along the lines of, a brand is what you make of
    it. If it is too visualy pigeonholed up front, it leaves less room for viewer
    to decide. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

    and the City now.

    tv screen. I seem to recall seeing this. <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve changed my mind about the redesign since I&#39;ve seen it in use.
    They wanted to have it float at the bottom of the screen semi transparent. So
    it makes sense to make it boxy and simple.

  body: The first logo looks pharmaceutical. The newer version is ambiguous. It could
    be the logo for a pregnancy test kit.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/"
