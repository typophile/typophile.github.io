body: "I am going to suggest an argument which I have been struggling about recently.
  It is a shared opinion in book typography that a generous leading helps the reading
  process; and a 120% ratio (leading percentage referred to type size) is a typesetting
  norm that is usually given as correct for setting pages - obviuosly also depending
  on the typeface's specific design (ascenders and descenders lenghts, for example).
  But I am more and more persuaded that a *tighter* leading not only generates a better
  colour and texture - a page that *looks* better - but also helps reading as well,
  contributing on visually connecting one line to another. I have a set an example
  to clarify this, with the left page set in Adobe Garamond 11/13 (the standard 120
  ratio) and the right page set at 11/12. I am curious to know any other opinion on
  the matter.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/texture_6687.jpg]"

  body: "Good point. I think it\u2019s no good for continuous reading if the leading
    is too wide when text is set in a typeface with low x-height and long descenders
    and ascenders. One sees this very often in publishing where omnipresent Garamond
    is used. This causes more pages and the book thicker, which may be the reason
    behind it.\r\nIf the lines are falling apart something is wrong. But this is to
    be judged by a good typographer: a type with the classical proportions of a Renaissance
    Antiqua needs less leading, others with larger x-heights and shorter descenders
    and ascenders a bit more."

    Also, I think the genre matters a lot in this respect: for instance, I''d hate
    to read philosophy set with such tight leading but it might be okay for fiction.'

  body: "Few loose observations:\r\n\r\nLeft page's leading seems to be intended for
    more \"humanistic\" content then the other. (Anyway: it's like Rorschach's Test,
    isn't it?).\r\n\r\nBut, sincerelly, I don't think the right page has better colour
    and texture.\r\n\r\nBoth pages are in English, which gives an even colour. My
    language (Polish), containing high percentage of diagonals: a, k, s, w, y, z,
    would create a messy surface with such tight leading.\r\n\r\nOnce I mechanically
    increased contrast of a tested typeface (of a medial contrast) which seemed to
    need some larger leading. The vivisection returned distinct boumas which resulted
    in faster reading and allowed to reduce the leading. So I suppose, also the inner
    wordspace is an important factor.\r\n\r\nI also think (as a habitual reader),
    that the even colour is not always the best and desirable solution. \r\n[Footnotes
    of complicated content (so using small caps, italics and numbers alltogether)
    set in the best typographic manner, are extremely heavy to read]. \r\nIn the plain
    text, elements like en-dash help during scanning a page or searching a certain
    place in a book. But they are visible only at larger leading.\r\nPolish typesetting
    practically abandoned the em-dash in recent years, what results in better colour,
    but dialogues in fiction seem to be spoken with the machinegun speed, since there
    is no pause in the air; they melt together. So I see a paradox here.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, there is a lot of dogma about. The other argument for generous leading
    is that it minimizes the variance in word spacing you'll get with justified csettings.\r\n\r\nI
    think what is really going on is that *readability* is a matter of type size,
    measure, leading, and word spacing. Change one, and the optimum value of the others
    may change. \r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, designers often give different answers than readers
    -- yes, I've done some limited testing, using editors as readers, versus designers.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    all these are constrained by the trim. Times past, paper came is certain sheet
    sizes, and people wanted to be efficient; not pay for a larger sheet & then trim
    away what wasn't wanted.\r\n\r\nAnyway, sheet size affects margins, which in turn
    affect measure, which affects leading, type size, etc.\r\n\r\nFor a generality
    though, yes, I think you are right, current leading practices are a designer affectation
    from looking at shapes rather than words.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is a very interesting setting of dark and light typefaces with different
    leadings in Mitchel and Wightman's Book Typography. (p. 185-6) It shows that with
    the dark Quadraat, it benefits from generous leading, whereas the light Spectrum
    benefits from tighter leading. They conclude, \r\n\r\n\"If you decide to use a
    dark face it wll benefit from increased leading to prevent the overall colour
    from becoming too black. Equally, if you decide to use a very light face, reducing
    the leading will prevent the text from becoming a pale grey.\"\r\n\r\nOverall
    lightness and darkness is not the only factor. The impact of leading also varies
    with the length of the extenders, and also how the weight is distributed in the
    face. \r\n\r\nOne of the things I was fascinated with in Linotype Caslon Old Face
    (a metal face only) is that it looks dark, but could be set solid or almost solid
    and still look good. I tried to achieve this in my revival Williams Caslon Text,
    also. That is, I tried to \"square the circle\" by looking both dark and open,
    so that it could take less leading yet not look too light. \r\n\r\nAs the influences
    are so complex, the only thing to do is to try out different typefaces with different
    measures, sizes and leading, and see what looks inviting and readable to you\u2014as
    well as considering what the economic demands are.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I like
    the more lattice-like look of the page with less leading than is fashionable now,
    but it has to be the right typeface design that can take it. Adobe Garamond, with
    its long extenders, doesn't need as much leading as, eg., Quadraat, I would think,
    though I haven't actually tested them against each other.     "
