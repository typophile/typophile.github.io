Its pretty bold to ask someone to create artwork from a font they don't have and have it sent to them. Its a twist on &quot;can you send a font to me for free&quot;. I included the email address because this guy needs to know its soooo wrong. Any thoughts, Dan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry for a late reply, guys, but I had my reasons. I'm no goddamn weasel. <BR> <BR>I never <i>wanted</i> to have a long-winded discussion about all this shite because the absurdity in that only makes me more disappointed in you. The absurdity is in the fact that it would take you five minutes to help a stranger who politely asked for help if you <i>were</i> able to provide him with the outline, but instead you choose to use your &quot;valuable&quot; time on talking out of your asses. This is what prompted me to write the original comment in the first place, so absurdity laughs me in the face when I see you continuing being totally clueless. <BR> <BR>I do mind answering a few questions for two reasons. First of all, no one answered, or even tried to answer <i>my</i> question, so I don't feel like answering yours. Second, I've heard &quot;What do you do for a living?&quot; argument a hundred thousand times before and you don't have to waste your time convincing me that the world revolves around money &ndash; I know that already, and I do need money to eat and be able to talk to you. <BR> <BR>By asking me about what I do for a living, you are only proving my point. You think about money and even want to talk to me about money. Well then, why the fück don't you just say it? I mean, if you see nothing wrong with measuring everything with money, why don't you just stay cool and answer my question like this: No, I can't think in terms of anything other than money. Than we would agree and no one would get hurt. How about that, eh? <BR> <BR>If you want to talk about money, go talk to Meredith &ndash; she seems to be more than willing to put words into my mouth. If you ask me more question, I'm sure she'll be glad to answer them for me. <BR> <BR>You don't have to call me mister to pretend to be polite when you aren't. I don't have the courtesy, but neither do you, so let's just cut the crap, shell we? I'm not insulting you on purpose, but you <i>are</i> being insulted by my honest opinion about you. You can change that opinion, if you wish to, or care &ndash; it's mostly up to you. <BR> <BR>I don't &quot;barge&quot; in here. What is this, some kind of small, snobbish, private cocktail party? Am I supposed to crawl or squeeze in here? This is a public forum were I chose to voice my goddamn honest opinion. If moderators feel like it, they are welcome to ban me from here. And by the way, if you weren't all singing to the same stupid tune, I probably wouldn't have my voiced opinion the way I did. Do you realise how cliquish you all sound? <BR> <BR>My whole point, if you still haven't realised it, is that you should be nice to people around you when you can, when it doesn't really cost you anything. When was the last time you helped a old man on the street to carry a slightly heavy bag? I can argue that it does <i>not</i> take much to provide someone with an outline, if you have what it takes. If you can't help, or don't feel like it, just go by. I don't <i>care</i> whether you roll in the money or not, but when you start talking about charging money for five minutes of your time, you are making an arse out of yourselves. We are not talking about greed here, but arrogance. <BR> <BR>I'll comment on the original post that started this thread: It's not illegal to make an outline of a typeface and share it with someone else, nor do I think there is anything ethically wrong with that. Comparing an outline of a few letters with a font sounds like a bad joke &ndash; there is much more to a font than that. It's almost an insult to someone who actually <i>has</i> created more than just a few letter outlines. It's not bold to politely ask for free help as the guy did. If anything, it's <i>daring,</i> and I wish there were more daring guys like him. <BR> <BR>To Yves: No, the typography section on my webpage is not my idea of being funny. In fact, I haven't written anything more boring than what you can read there. There are even some factual errors in there, like the claim of non-existence of system-wide font substitution in Win2000, but I'm too lazy to correct all that shite. On the other hand, I don't take myself too seriously, so you are welcome to laugh at my boring babble if you think it's funny. <BR> <BR>(I don't understand &ndash; if everyone disagrees with me, who the fück voted my first comment so high? Should I suspect you guys for pulling off some kind of prank on me? I don't think this is amusing.) <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sergej&hellip; I think most people here do think in other terms than money. If you do work honestly as a designer or even as someone who designs type, you always end up underpaid, except if by some magic trick you end up being the next Neville Brody, David Carson or Stefan Sagmeister. You always put love in your work and do the details and stuff like that &hellip; an no client ever pays enough for that. You don't become a designer for the money&hellip; and if anybody does, he or she will end up disappointed. As with any craft, I guess. You do it because you love your job.  <BR> <BR>&gt;you should be nice to people around you when  <BR>&gt;you can <BR>Most folks here are &ndash; check out the typograhic ID section, It takes TIME to identify typefaces for the people asking here&hellip; and while other companies charge money for font identification, here it IS free.  <BR> <BR>The problem here is that the initial poster from MyFonts.com isn't willing to spend 35 $ or whatever it is on Charlotte Sans and NETWORKING SOLUTIONS LTD. doesn't sound as if he's doing a work-for-free or thing or a student job here, does it? And for a simple sample, there are enough type teasers on the web &ndash; as on the Fontshop site &ndash; to get a gif of the visual feeling of Charlotte Sans, but no, he wants a useable and scaleable and editable EPS &ndash; ergo he wants to save money on not buying the font.  <BR> <BR>If he were a student or would make clear that it is pro-bono work, he'd probably gotten his outline. I've yet to meet a small-minded and petty type-designer.  <BR> <BR>I agree with your initial POV, that people should be nice to other people, but most remarks here didn't strike me as arrogant or mean-spirited but rather as tongue-in-cheek until you kind of  PO'd Yves and some others.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have no objections against asking someone to set something in a font and convert it to outlines. It's not like 'borrowing' an actual font. The critical data is not in the outlines. But, for me, it's much easier to buy the actual font because you can do so much more with it, for such a small price. If you were to charge for the typesetting service, how much would you charge anyway? $50? I'd rather buy the font! <BR> <BR>That brings me to a question&hellip; I'm doing an identity program for a client using Luc(as) de Groot's Corpid. Now, they want me to set their address in Corpid in a proper format, as an outlined EPS file so they could drop it into their documents without having to buy the actual fonts. Is that acceptable?

But the whole discussion here is about giving design work for free, <b>not</b> about giving fonts for free. And this is a thing every designer has to decide for themselves <i>if</i> they can afford to do so. <BR> <BR>I think you also should differ between those who <i>can't</i> set type properly and need it done and those who are designers and are just after saving the money. But are you really saving a dime if you pay $40 for the setting instead of $50 for the font  (for the designer, not the typophobic)? <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In future I shall just use the scan that my customer provided and redraw the whole word and that way I shall keep everyone happy. How many times have you designers out there redrawn a 'no smoking' sign even though it was once drawn up by a designer who probably doesn't receive any more royalties for it. <BR> <BR>I fully appreciate Isaac's posting on my site now but I would say that photography definitely has far more imagination than a simple few words of a font. <BR> <BR>No, I would not class myself as a jerk, clueless or even a leech and I sincerely apologise for causing so much trouble. I would just class myself as asking a favour that one day I would like to return. As I said, I could have redrawn the words by blowing the jpeg up to around 400% but that would have taken time and that was against me. <BR> <BR>As a matter as interest, how many of you designers have been influenced by other's work and have incorporated an element of that design in your own work? How many photographers have tried to copy Ansel Adam's work, or how many painters have tried to copy Picasso's work? Do you get what I mean? <BR> <BR>Once again, I'll just spend that extra bit of time recreating the whole thing. This was part of a logo for a company based in England and I usually contact the particular company direct for their logo and that way I'm not in breach of copyright. <BR> <BR>Can't believe I've caused so much trouble over a rather innocent request and I can't apologise enough. <BR> <BR>Ian 'the jerk' Gregory</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't see you as a jerk, but a bit uninformed. You didn't explain your needs in the original post, so you got a reaction to the information you gave. This gem, &quot;I fully appreciate Isaac's posting on my site now but I would say that photography definitely has far more imagination than a simple few words of a font,&quot; only furthers the impression that you don't understand the point (from my perspective). <BR> <BR>A) The typesetting (or copying, as you put it) is only <i>part</i> of the equation. <BR> <BR>B) The font <i>as a whole</i> represents a lot of time and energy and creativity. <BR> <BR>You indicated in your original post that you wanted to circumvent the purchase of a font that you recognized and costs only $40. Why not add that negligible cost into your bill? The time spent on the purchase and typesetting alone should cover it anyway. Redrawing a font that isn't made of basic geometric shapes is time-consuming and difficult, and will just result in a sub-standard product anyway. <BR> <BR>Your needs are understandable, I'm put in that position occasionally as well, but you've stumbled onto issues that are large and long-running. If you want to people to understand your needs and your situation, then write clearly and completely next time. Just asking for free font outlines and typesetting without explanation doesn't garner much sympathy. <BR> <BR>I'm also curious what 'imagination' has to do with anything, as well.</div>

We have Photoshop 6, Illustrator 9 and Mac OSX but that's about as far forward as we're going to get for the moment.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Not sure why they felt the need to be anonymous <BR> <BR>Exactly. The best practical question to ask is: Has anonymity been used to good effect? I've read pretty much every single post on Typophile (except I totally pulled out of the Type-ID forum recently, and I'm largely avoiding the &quot;formally off-topic&quot; threads), and I think I've only seen two cases. It's like TV: <i>hypothetically</i> very useful to society, but in reality one of the worst things on the planet. <BR> <BR>That said, I don't think being reactionary is a good thing. We haven't had many anonymous attacks lately, and this little one here shouldn't cause a policy shift of itself. Plus personally I don't see fit to pressure the listmoms too much about management - I trust them. I've only ever given a listmom a management &quot;demand&quot; once, when I was being systematically defamed for over a year. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; if i had the font i'd probably hook you up. i hope someone does. <BR> <BR>Hmmm. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

My comment earlier is true, there are alot of angry people here and could use an anger management course. But I guess its better to vent here than create a crime with their anger. I don't post Anonymously because I am responsible for my comments and my actions. This is why Ian should be given a break. He took the heat. Its time to shut down this string and move on.</div>
