  <BR> <BR>Is this font commercially available? &#40;For me to buy, that is&#41;.
  <BR>It seems a nice match for Big Caslon I would like to use for a project.

  body: It seeems as if this font is still not available commerically. However, you
    could always email Harry at Font Bureau to see if it is something that will be
    available soon.

    is in general weak. Unless it&#39;s a commission.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

    border=0> <BR> <BR>Your opinion , fair enough, but it sounds a teensy bit  <BR>pretentious
    telling Mr. Schwartz should be ashamed. <BR>Let&#39;s just stick to the fact you

  body: Type founders were slow to put the sans form into metal -- it had been around
    for many decades in signage &#40;painted and architectural&#41; by the time of
    the Caslon foundry&#39;s type version. <BR> <BR>Founders were also slow to add
    a lower case, it took decades to emerge, in fact. <BR> <BR>So Schwartz is savvy
    to base his lower case on contemporary signage. Without seeing his sources, and
    without a knowledge of English signage of that era, it&#39;s difficult to criticize
    his interpretation. Do you have samples, Reminiscor? <BR> <BR>There is another
    strategy for creating the lower case, which would be to derive it more closely
    from the serifed types of that era, which were mainly moderns. That would produce
    something which looked neater, and more like the English type of the era, with
    a less &#34;unfolded&#39; curve and smaller aperture.   <BR> <BR>But the idea
    that this would be more typographically authentic is false. The modern form of
    letter was just as developed in signage and lettering as it was in type. &#40;This
    can be verified by examining gravestones.&#41; The signwriters who developed the
    sans were skilled in rendering the refined modern form. The difficulty was purely
    one of design -- they were in terra incognita. It took a long time for a satisfactory
    &#34;standard&#39; of the lower case sans letterform to emerge, because the task
    is extremely difficult. &#40;Caps much much easier.&#41; For us today, with our
    tools, and knowledge and experience of the sans form, it&#39;s relatively easy
    to derive a grotesque sans from the early 18th century modern serifed style, and
    it would work well with such type. &#40;BTW, Big Caslon is not such a type, dating
    from almost a century earlier.&#41; <BR> <BR>If the lower case of Caslon&#39;s
    Egyptian appears &#34;flawed&#34;, that&#39;s not through any lack of skill on
    Schwarz&#39;s part &#40;you won&#39;t find it in his other work, so why here?&#41;
    but because it&#39;s a necessary condition of his quite correct methodolgy.

  body: I second Nick&#39;s request for samples. Christian Schwartz&#39;s work thus
    far has <i>only</i> shown a continued growth as a type designer. I&#39;d imagine
    that if the Caslon sans didn&#39;t have that naivete it wouldn&#39;t work as a
    revivalist sans from that era at all.
