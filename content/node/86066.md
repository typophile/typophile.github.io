  so little compared to other type families i usually see.\r\nis it because these
  are not good designs?\r\nor what is going on with these?\r\n"

  body: P22 sells their fonts at a loss and makes up the difference in movie receipts
    and t-shirt sales.

  body: you mean they make most of their money from selling t-shirts and movies?

  body: It is possible that Si was referring to the legal action taken by P22 against
    Universal for selling t-shirts and other merchandise using their typefaces.

    simply, Kennerley is out of fashion right now.\r\nHowever, given that it was the
    most popular face of the teens and twenties, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it
    came back into fashion at some point in the future, if and when historicism displaces
    modernism as the preferred retro vogue.\r\nBut then, new cuts would be required,
    with size-speci\uFB01c versions no doubt."

  body: I think p22 has a royalty based licence, so you pay a relativily low price
    upfront, but are restricted in the ways you can use it. f.i. if you design a book
    and have it printed 20 000 times or something, you have to pay a royalty fee for
    this to p22. I don't know how high this fee is, though.

  body: "As I understand it, the P22 EULA only requires special licensing for things
    like logos, packaging, identities, movie/TV use, etc. The wording appears to be
    slightly ungrammatical, but it seems that designing a book with a P22 font, regardless
    of print run, does not ordinarily require anything but the basic license. But
    in the attempt to catch all possible high-value uses they can extract money from,
    they worded that part in such an open-ended manner that reading the EULA doesn't
    make this entirely clear. I think it was partially clarified by Richard Kegler
    in a post here a few years ago.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would note that the
    rest of the license is both clearer than usual and quite reasonable. In particular,
    they allow modifications (for internal use, as usual), which is really important,
    so they're one of the relatively few foundries I am inclined to license fonts
    from. I'm not a Goudy fan, but I've even licensed Kennerley."

  body: "Would be interested in the clarification by Mr Kegler, any idea how to find
    this thread?\r\n\r\nBTW I reread the license and it seems you are right, that
    the extra license applies mostly to logos and large campaigns and media productions.
    It is indeed a quite fair license, and the fonts are very affordable."

    find anything very helpful. It could be defective memory, or it could be the present
    deficient searchability of Typophile."
