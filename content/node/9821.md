body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;i need crit on this poster,
  so lemme tell you a few words about it. <BR> <BR>it is a promotional poster for
  a graffiti jam, commemorating the bombing of yugoslavia 24.03.1999 <BR>the date
  is also the name of the event. <BR>here&#39;s the logo of the event: <BR><a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/logo.gif"
  target="_blank">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/logo.gif</a> <BR>and
  here is the poster: <BR><a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/05_typo03.gif"
  target="_blank">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/05_typo03.gif</a> <BR>
  <BR>on the poster the bridge connects the place of the jam, it takes place along
  the bombed and destroyed bridge here in novi sad. <BR>i had problems with typo placement
  here. <BR> <BR>also there are a couple of other posters on this adress so if you
  wanna look deeper into it go right ahead. <BR><a href="http://www.semperfi-1982.com"
  target="_blank">http://www.semperfi-1982.com</a> <BR> <BR>i have gotten some really
  contradictory crit from my profesor at school and from some other people so i think
  i&#39;ll need another oppinion. <BR> <BR>sorry if this sounds desperate, &#42; sniffs
  for desperation scent in the air &#42; , this is kind of important to me. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Im usually a big proponent of white space but the top right corner seems awkward
    with the starburst/logo way up in the corner. <BR> <BR>Maybe try it bigger? <BR>
    <BR>Also maybe you want to put that splatter on the bottom right on top of the
    bridge?!? <BR> <BR>I really do like the bold shapes and white space&#40;are these
    going to be silk screens or Photocopies?&#41; but maybe you should but some more
    texture in it.. especially considering what the event is about.

  body: thanx for the feedback casey, i apreciate it. <BR> <BR>thre are a few other
    versions of it with the typo placement changed, and just so you know i will do
    a new one today, because i have an idea. basically no one likes the &#34;Graffiti
    Jam&#34; type, so i wanna ditch that, i am considering either spraypainting it
    or scratching it. i might even place it on the bridge itself, i&#39;ll see what
    will i do. <BR> <BR><a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/05_typo02.gif"

    <BR> <BR>ok guys, expect a new one soon <BR> <BR>PS <BR>they will probably be
    printed in offset print
