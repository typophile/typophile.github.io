  $99 for customers in the rest of the world. That makes it about 50% more expensive
  in Europe.\r\n\r\nSo, why the difference? The meanies! Are we Europeans richer?
  A bit stupid? Are we more generous with our cash? It's not an unfamiliar scenario:
  directly changing a dollar sign to a Euro or Pound sign and keeping the numbers
  the same, so I thought I'd ask them to see why. It's actually quite a difference.
  Below is my email thread with FontShop. I've given Theresa the whole weekend and
  yesterday to reply to my last (cheeky) message, but I don't think she'll bother,
  so I thought I'd share it here.\r\n\r\nIf not mean, it does seem a bit unfair. Do
  you think we can lobby them to fairly convert the $99?\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>On Jan 25,

  it's a mistake on the website? Or is shipping included? I can't believe it is because

  the price of the FontBook is correct and does not included shipping. It is set at
  a value that does not change and therefore the cost of the book is higher than it
  would be if purchased in the US because the Euro is stronger than the US dollar.
  Sorry for the inconvenience. If there is anything else that I can help you with

    you are the one who sounds a little angry.\r\n\r\nActually, I suspect that the
    FontBook is produced and printed in Europe. Therefore, given the weak dollar,
    it might be the Americans getting a deal by only having to pay $99, not the Europeans
    getting shafted\u2026\r\n\r\nNote also, that for the past few days, the dollar
    has been rising and and falling and rising again slightly against the pound and
    the euro, and perhaps the pound is falling slightly against the euro as well.
    These things change all of the time! But a book is produced up front at a specific
    time. Constantly changing prices based on volatile exchange rates is something
    that most international companies do not do. And FontShop is a small company (at
    least compared with, say, Apple), so I wouldn't expect it from them."

    much higher prices than their American cousins. It as though companies feel that
    Americans just wont pay the higher prices whereas the rest of the world will.
    The rest of the world ends up subsidising lower prices to Americans. (This even
    happens on U.S. Amazon.)

    than those in the rest of the world and stump up the extra (equivalent) $47 without
    question then? To be honest, I am neither convinced of the truth of that idea
    or the prescribed reaction. I am more convinced that Europeans complain less and
    buy artificially expensive goods more readily and FontShop are just taking advantage
    of that. Or that we're consistently offered no other option but to pay the arbitrary
    premium here in Europe.\r\n\r\nI certainly agree that the bottom line has no emotion,
    so <em>Mean, mean FontShop</em> should probably be replaced by <em>Cynical, cynical
    FontShop</em>. (I'm tempted by <em>Profiteering, profiteering...</em>, but that
    would probably be going a little too far.)\r\n\r\nAnd yes, a FontShop font - say
    FF Meta Book - is similarly priced at \u20AC229 or $240. A realistic conversion
    of $240 would be \u20AC162 making it a substantial 71% more expensive in Europe.
    Am I 71% better off than an American? I doubt it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of you are
    right and there's little to be said about the price difference. It is after all
    a free market and FontShop are far from the only people who mark up their products
    so much for the European market. And do I have to buy it? Well, no, of course
    I don't. And nor will I. \r\n\r\nI think more than the mere fact that they do
    this, it's the fact they're so blatant about it which makes it look so bad. Reputations
    are undone over matters like this and I can't be the only one who's noticed it.
    Worse, and I'm sticking my neck out here I admit, (and no, I'm not in any way
    justifying or advocating theft) won't such seeming unfairness make the moral distaste
    of copying/taking a font rather than buying it seem just that little bit more
    easily forgotten if its legitimate sale looks like it's part of a racket?"
