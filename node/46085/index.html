  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When I think of fonts, I tend to think about the usual fonts we are told to use in college and high school which is Times or Times New Roman. Then after those two, Arial comes to mind. I’ve never really had the opportunity to explore fonts and find the one that I like or fit me. I soon found that no matter what I write it will be in either of those three fonts, but what about if I want something creative and fun? I had no idea where to go to find a font that represents me. The typical fonts that are on Word don’t express who I am, so I went searching to try and find myself in type. I was lucky to find one that I thought expressed my love of the one thing that is most important to me, music. The font that I found is Bleeding Cowboy. The reason I love this font is because of the bleeding effect because I bleed music and it is what I live for as well as the feminine touch it has with the curls on the end of certain letters. That’s what makes this font perfect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Christilisa,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see someone take an interest in typography and importance. I would like to know what your experience lies in (are you a graphic designer? Musician?). Some would call what you were describing as the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; of the typeface. This one does have a very strong voice, although I may disagree that it is bleeding. Have you ever done any screen printing? It looks like a grungy, low -quality (not an insult) screen print, which seems more indicative of a specific kind of music. I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is that other people won&rsquo;t necessarily perceive it as your identity, which is the point of a logo. The name of the typeface is secondary to what it actually looks like. Nancy has given you a good resource to look at for some basics, but maybe there are one or two things I could offer as something to watch out for. Bleeding Cowboy is what is described as a &ldquo;Display&rdquo; typeface, which means that it would be fine for big headlines, or a logo, but not as much for body copy (smaller text, such as the contact info on your business card) becuase it can get illegible (and at a whole page, it would be nearly impossible to read). I would recommend pairing it with a more normal typeface, as it would help emphasize the character of &ldquo;Bleeding Cowboy.&rdquo; One other rule that typographers and designers live by is to <em>never</em> distort the text from its proportions. By warping the word Eclectic Music, it destroys the fine tuning that the type designer put into the curves and shapes. Ultimately, it has a tendency to make it look more computer-designed, and less by a human hand. Instead, try manipulating the size and angle of each individual letter.</p>
<p>I quickly mocked up a sample, may not be the best solution, but it touches my points:</p>
