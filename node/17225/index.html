  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Everyone!

I'm doing a logo for a birthday party room & retail space for girls. Basically, 1/2 the place is a retail store thats selling dolls, puzzles, etc & the other side is a dressup, karaoke for the kids who have parties.

Its called bella club. 

I want you to critique my logo (so far). Black is probably not the final color.

1- The diamonds represent a black & whote harlequin counter thats inside the retail area. Do you think the white is TOO white?
2- Do you enjoy the outer glow? Will this be hard to quality control when in vector (e.g. printing errors, etc).
3- Too adultish? Age group is 4-12. Mind you, the soccer moms are the ones paying for all this (higher income target audience).
4- My clients are trying to add a crown to this. Do you think its missing something or do you feel its finished?

Thanks in advance</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The first things I thought of, when I viewed the logo PDF, were, 'Las Vegas' / 'Casino' <em>( Maybe thats just me, but, Yea, I think it may be too 'adultish', if its, as you stated, intended for kids :)</em>

I think this should rather be bright, colourful, and most of all, FUN
<em>( Not as 'serious' as your current logo scribble would propose )</em>

Something 'happyhappyjoyjoy' :), playful, slightly 'girly'ish'

		<div class="commentbody">Agree with Dav, defintely not a logo for a kids club. Maybe you're taking the word 'club' far to serious. It needs to be kid like, cheerful, friendly, not 'sophisticated' as the Bella.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I believe children (especially girls) enjoy the pretence that they are going to a sophisticated club so the script treatment is probably going in the right direction. That said the club bit doesn't work for me. And you are right about the glow, it is probably too risky unless you can control the print. The crown sounds a bit princessy to me although I suppose that would depend on the treatment.

		<div class="commentbody">Not sure if they have <a href="http://www.clublibbylu.com/">Club Libby Lu</a> in your area. Their logo has the crown your client is pushing for. Also a very "girly" typeface, like Dav is recommending. 

If Club Libby Lu is a direct competitor, what you've created <em>might be</em> appropriately different from the "expected" treatment.

Black and white are probably a bit too sophisticated for little girls. And I'd lose the glow/shadow due to the control issues you've mentioned. It does look a bit "Vegas" to me, also. But then again, not all little girls are into pink ponies and princesses. If the store has a more Old Hollywood glamour feel to it, this kind of treatment might work. </div>
