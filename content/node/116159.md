  Fabian De Lange's typeface Eclectic, my only problem with it is that I am having
  quite a bit of trouble pairing it with a serif and a san serif for body and title
  copy, I've copied some links to show Eclectic.  I am open to any suggestions! Thanks
  so much guys and have a great one!\r\n\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/FabianDelange-Eclectic-2011.jpg\r\nhttp://freetypography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/electic.jpg"
