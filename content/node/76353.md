  me with:\r\n\r\n1) do you put spaces before ellipses in a sentence?. example: \r\nbla
  bla bla... bla bla bla \r\nOR \r\nbla bla bla ... bla bla bla ? \r\nthe text I received
  uses no space at the beginning and\r\nI don't know if this was a mistake or not.
  \r\n\r\n2) do you always use \xAB\u2009\xBB? even if its just for one word? \r\ne.g(random
  sentence from text) Ce dernier mot, qui a donn\xE9 \xAB\u2009table\u2009\xBB...
  \r\ncan this ever be \"table\"?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you to whoever answers."
