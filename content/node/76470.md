body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI have a client (a wine company) which has a printer
  that is able to print/burn letter on wine woodbox. It looks like the printer has
  arial as the default embedded font. So they want their custom type to be print also
  and want their own font to be embedded in the printer's memory.\r\n\r\nI contacted
  the printer distributor who told me that the font need to be converted in postscript
  DST. O_o\r\nI have no idea and never heard of this DST format. Anybody might know
  about it and is it an easy way to convert a PS1/OTF font into this DST format ?\r\n\r\nThe
  printer also accept HPGL format\u2026 I recall that it is a Corel format. Also anyone
  knows how to convert OTF font to HPGL without too much assle ?\r\n\r\nthanks in
  advance,\r\n\r\nJulien"

  body: "Courtesy of Google...\r\n\r\nHPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) is
    the standard print format for HP plotters, i.e., the data stream sent to HP (and
    compatible) plotters.  If you are now plotting to a Hewlett-Packard plotter, you
    are using HPGL!.  Most CAD programs output HPGL directly because they can print
    on HP plotters.\r\n\r\nHPGL is a an open language vector graphics file format
    (as opposed to raster or bit-map), assuring optimal file size with very fast and
    100% accurate rendering.  HPGL/RTL can be output by all CAD/CAM/CAE systems.   All
    HP printers starting with the LaserJet 3 include HPGL as an integral part of PCL
    support.  RTL (raster transfer language) is a raster-based specification and a
    subset of standalone HPGL (but not within PCL). SwiftView supports standalone
    HPGL, HPGL2 and monochrome RTL, and HPGL in PCL. "

    file format, but a graphics file format (in the same way that HPGL is), so you
    can't convert a ps1/otf to dst, you'd need to set the type and convert the image
    to dst. \r\n\r\nJason C"
