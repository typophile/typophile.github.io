  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>That&rsquo;s right. Gameloft is using Celestia Medium Redux, a fan modification of copyrighted Generation B. Someone needs to stop them.</p>
<p>[[http://www.haroldsfonts.com/genB.html|Generation B]], made by [[Harold&rsquo;s Fonts]], is inspired by film logos and posters between 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the official fonts of Hasbro&rsquo;s current <em>My Little Pony</em> line up of toys, media franchise and official merchandises. It&rsquo;s also in the subtitle part of the logo of the current generation&rsquo;s well-known cartoon show, <em>[[http://www.hasbrostudios.com/Our-Shows-Folder/My-Little-Pony|My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]</em>.</p>
<p>With the rise of the cartoon&rsquo;s fandom, some fans tried to create their version of Generation B. One user created a thing called [[http://fav.me/d3dqa8d|Celestia Medium]], but soon gave up after some concerns. Then, another user came up with small letters and Greek/Cyrillic letters, and named it [[http://www.mattyhex.net/CMR/|Celestia Medium Redux]], the font in question.</p>
<p>Apparently, Gameloft is using Celestia Medium Redux in their upcoming official <em>My Little Pony</em> mobile game, instead of Generation B.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t blame some individuals using knock off fonts on their unofficial, personal fan works because counting all of every single person who used it is impossible and suing them is technically a waste of time and money (unless you are from Disney). But this is a different matter. It&rsquo;s the official merchandise. Gameloft is using a fan-made font that (technically) infringed copyrighted font design (or, in the U.S. terms, a digital font file that might have altered from the original file) in an official game, instead of the original and official one! It&rsquo;s more like the developers involved didn&rsquo;t know anything about the font (If it&rsquo;s not, this is more serious problem!).</p>
<p>Now, someone needs to stop Gameloft from using Celestia Medium Redux before they officially release the game on 8 November, and put them on the pressure to change the font. But honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what should I start with as a third person.</p>
<p>Before you go, here is opinion from a professional-skilled artist who likes <em>Friendship is Magic</em>:</p>

<p>You know something! At least Woodrow is more legible than Generation B. But from what I know, it has no Greek and Cyrillic letters so I think it may cause a little trouble for internationalisation.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, legally there&rsquo;s really nothing we can do . . . A close comparison would be that a client specified Futura for their App and rather than buy Linotypes, they bought URW++s or Paratype&rsquo;s . . .</p>
<p>We know the folks from Hasbro have properly licensed the font and specify it in all the styles guides for the MLP product line but do not provide it to vendors.</p>
<p>Oddly, Gameloft DID contact us and we negotiated a license for them for this use, but then radio silence until we received word about their new game using a knock-off version of Harold&rsquo;s original font.</p>
<p>Again, legally they haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong but of course we&rsquo;re disappointed they chose the course of action they did.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your answer. Seriously, why Gameloft choose that way? Nevertheless, we should keep spreading this news everywhere and put Gameloft folks on the pressure until they entirely change that font to a proper one. Remember, for economic reason, not everyone can count and sue every person using knock-off fonts in their personal fan works. But big and well-established company like Gameloft using it in that officially licensed game? This is more than a serious problem.</p>
<p>Remember the [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/with_copyright_protectors_like_these_who_needs_enemies.php|Hadopi logo incident]]? Although that would be a slightly different case from this because it was about logo designers using a legal font intended for exclusive corporate use in a logo of another, unrelated French government agency for copyright protection, people have noticed the infringement and soon, after lots of complaints and pushing, the agency had to change the font to a properly licensed one, before making another change in years later.</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip; This is becoming a bit more complex problem than I thought. What should be the attitude to the knock-off/fake/unlicensed fonts, especially when major company making an officially licensed product?</p>
<p>Simply getting a license will cause no problem, and it will bring original and quality fonts. But it costs so much if it&rsquo;s too expensive, and in major cases, using the font for different purposes may require to buy another licenses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, knock-offs are technically not illegal, only a little different from the original, and it will help reducing costs if it is free. But someone will notice it anyway, and even if there is no basis to sue, some will still tackle and complain. Besides, some of them has inferior quality than original.</p>
<p>This is getting more puzzled&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, despite not being illegal, it still shows how terrible Gameloft is at choosing fonts. And still, the people at Font Bros. are disappointed with what Gameloft have done.</p>
<p>I think that, normally, big major companies with such scale as Gameloft would just end up buying a proper license. Why did they act like&hellip; Um&hellip;  &lsquo;Hey, I have no money for this.&rsquo;? (Just my shallow idea, though.)</p>
<blockquote>On the other hand, “Celestia,” used in the context of typefaces and fonts, is a registered trademark of Mark von[sic] Bronkhurst.[sic] So, he might have a legitimate case to pursue against the maker of Celestia Medium Redux, if he cared to — at least to change the name, if not to cease distribution.</blockquote>
<p>This is kinda interesting. In the universe of the current line up, Princess Celestia is the co-ruler of the &ldquo;magical land of Equestria&rdquo; who raises the sun, along with Princess Luna who raises the moon. That is where the name of the original Celestia Medium knock-off font came from, and I guess the maker of that font may have not know anything about it. (And yes, it has absolutely nothing to do with Mark van Bronkhorst&rsquo;s [[http://www.mvbfonts.com/mvb_celestia_antiqua/|Celestia Antiqua]])</p>

<p>A quick Google search finds that Gameloft has been criticized for copying other games, and that some employees have complained of 100-hour work weeks.</p>
<p>Many game companies are under a lot of economic stress because the rise of small game apps for smart phones and tablets. Used be that computer games routinely sold for fairly high prices; now people go app stores and buy games for a few bucks each. So companies may feel the need to cut corners to keep prices down.</p>

<p>Yes I&rsquo;ve brought this up before.  The whole idea of plagiarism needs to be looked at differently in an area where everyone&rsquo;s work is 90% identical anyway. However this seems to make most around here very uncomfortable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>As the guy who &ldquo;started a crusade of FUD,&rdquo; (an interesting way of putting it) some more information about the history of Celestia Medium might be helpful.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of the fandom, the only people who knew of / used Generation B in their work were me and a few others who actually took the time to figure out what font was being used. There was no knockoff version available at the start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if she thought it was wrong she wouldn’t have done it in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong because she didn&rsquo;t know about Generation B or that she was ripping someone off in the first place. Sometime in spring 2011, PurpleTinker developed the Celestia Medium font based on a screenshot of Generation B (that was not labeled as such). She traced a PNG file of the Generation B character set that was posted on Equestria Daily . The first version of Celestia Medium was a literal trace of Generation B, but all of the metrics and proportions were screwed up. It was also missing the uppercase and special characters. The actual glyphs were fairly close to Gen B (it took a smart eye to notice specific glyph differences), but the glyph sizes were all normalized and the baselines too. This reduced Celestia Medium to a very block-like face, resulting in long strips of letters that had none of the whimsy or motion of Generation B. They were more difficult to read as well. A clear tell of Celestia Medium was the letter Os: they were the same size as all the other glyphs. Compared to the toy boxes, promotional materials, etc with used Generation B, it looked quite ugly. It sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the real deal.</p>
<p>I wrote the first &ldquo;Why you shouldn&rsquo;t use Celestia Medium&rdquo; in June 2011 based on the font that existed, and PurpleTinker agreed with me that people should use the genuine article. She was unaware of Generation B itself, having traced that PNG of the rip. There&rsquo;s no animosity between us on that, and she handled it about as classily as someone could.</p>
<p>When she took the font down, MattyHex started making Celestia Redux based on the original font file for Celestia Medium and started tweaking the glyphs to make it slightly different (and worse) than Generation B. I wrote the second &ldquo;Why you still shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; bit in September 2011 right around the time that the Redux version came out. Since then, MattyHex has expanded the feature set of Celestia Redux considerably. He&rsquo;s added many special characters that didn&rsquo;t exist in GenB, and he also added a new set of lowercase glyphs (relegating the copies of Generation B&rsquo;s lower case to CR&rsquo;s upper case). The lower case makes it into something completely unrelated, and it&rsquo;s not a very readable face either. So Celestia Redux at this time has morphed into something quite different than Generation B, but people still try to use it as a substitute. Its uppecase still fares poorly compared to Generation B, especially now that he&rsquo;s specifically changed the uppercase glyphs to look kind of like Generation B but not exactly. MattyHex doesn&rsquo;t have the excuse that PT did; he made the Redux version specifically knowing about Generation B to create a knockoff version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing for random fanartists to use Celestia Redux once or twice, but it&rsquo;s very tacky and a bit low for Gameloft who has an official license of the game to use a fan knockoff font. It&rsquo;s a pure case of cheapness and greed, which is not unsurprising given their other games and business practices. Other Hasbro licensees continue to use Generation B. This is not the first time Gameloft has appropriated fanworks; they&rsquo;ve used several pieces of fanart (likely acquired from google image search) without contacting the artists as assets for the My Little Pony game and their advertising. As far as I know, this is the only case of Celestia Medium slipping into a licensed product. Not even the fan created licensed shirts on WeLoveFine use it.</p>
<p>On the usage of Celestia Redux in the game itself, they shouldn&rsquo;t have used it (or Generation B, for that matter) for all of that body text. Something more readable should have been used instead. I believe there is a body copy font that Hasbro uses on the toy boxes, but its specific name is escaping me at the moment. Generation B would have been fine for titling, but Celestia Redux is used for almost everything in the game, and it&rsquo;s very difficult to read because of it. It&rsquo;s true that Font Bros. basically has no recourse, because of the way the laws work here in the states (Which I&rsquo;m sure many are aware of) and their response here details it pretty well. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that nothing can be done, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my primary objection to Celestia Redux these days is 1. that it&rsquo;s ugly and 2. I think it&rsquo;s a shame that Harold is not getting his fair share from the unexpected popularity of ponies. Tons of people out there (that are not Hasbro) are making a lot of money off the pony fandom these days for things that are less work than fonts, and there&rsquo;s a lot of Celestia Redux being used in fanart or projects that are used/sold for profit. I just think people should do the right thing and pay the man his due.</p>

Everything is a remix, but time and respect make worlds of difference. When Todd Goldman traces the work of relatively obscure living cartoonists and sells uncredited, unlicensed T-shirts of it at Hot Topic, we should not pretend that this is equivalent to John Williams echoing Gustav Holst in his score for Star Wars.  There is a continuum between homage and ripoff, and the dividing line of what&rsquo;s acceptable is fuzzy but not extremely so.</div>

<p>Apparently, there are [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20629245|ongoing criticisms about this game regarding its economy system]]. But that&rsquo;s another problem.</p>
<p>I saw someone intervened in this thread with debate on originality, inspiration and plagiarism. At first, I couldn&rsquo;t decide which side I should take. Now, at least one thing is clear: We can tell whether it is a rip-off, knock-off, plagiarism, copyright infringement, parody or homage by looking closely at it and finding its background and context.</p>
<p>I may have missed a chance to comment, but I think Diner, oldnick, hrant, cerulean, Thomas Phinney and JamesM can get together to think about how to convince Hasbro and Gameloft to solve this problem. I&rsquo;m going to send Diner&rsquo;s (official?) complaint to major fan news blogs, but how can I publicise this issue months after the games release? Please give me some advice.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, everyone!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Given the description of the situation in the initial post, I&rsquo;m surprised to learn in a later post that Gameloft did not do anything actionable.</p>
<p>That implies, at the very least, that the font they are using is <em>not</em> a mod of the font from Harold&rsquo;s fonts in question; that it&rsquo;s freshly drawn, even if it closely resembles the other font. Font software is well protected by copyright law, even if font designs are only weakly protected in the U.S. (as opposed to not protected at all: there were changes in the law recently).</p>
<p>However, on re-reading the thread, it appears that Gameloft <strong>ought</strong> to be in deep trouble with <em>Hasbro</em>, because they&rsquo;ve licensed the My Little Pony product, and they&rsquo;re not appropriately protecting its brand identity; by not using the official font specified, they&rsquo;re making a licensed product that is not, in this one respect, however minor, differentiated from what a knock-off counterfeiter could do.</p>
<p>And that would remain true even if Celestia Medium Redux is an entirely legitimate typeface in the same genre as Generation B, and not a rip-off or plagiarism.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s also the question of violating the trademark of the original Celestia Medium, as it may not have been withdrawn long enough ago for it to be inactive&hellip;</p>

<p>The licensing agreement undoubtedly gave Hasbro opportunities to view the game at certain milestones during development and during beta testing, to protect their interests. If the knock-off font was close enough that Hasbro didn&rsquo;t notice and object before the game&rsquo;s release, they&rsquo;d have a hard time making the case that consumers (mostly children) would notice it.</p>

<p>Art is selfish, and to me only interesting to the artist. Craft exists to serve others, which is exactly my cup of tea. But seeing Craft as some sort of soulless drudgery is exactly what the flaming artistes want.</p>
<p>HOWEVER: There is no pure Art or pure Craft; one might imagine an axis with those extremes, with any creative act sitting somewhere on that axis. So any creative act draws <em>inspiration</em> -in a traditional artistic way- from its environment; this does not equate to <em>plagiarism</em>, by any level-headed definition of those terms. Khaled&rsquo;s view comes off as conveniently absolutist. Typical so-called &ldquo;open-source&rdquo; agenda-driven obfuscation. He wants me to quote a percentage?! That&rsquo;s what I call shallow. And really, &ldquo;if she thought it was wrong she wouldn’t have done it in the first place&rdquo;?! What planet are we on again?</p>
<p>I myself revel in shades of gray, and to me things that are a much darker shade of gray deserve more corrective effort. Duh.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A thread in which I recently participated concerned a typeface that someone expressed shock was still being offered for sale, despite being claimed to be an imitation of another typeface. In that case, it seemed clear to me that the &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; was merely a typeface belonging to the same genre; similar, but in no way a rip-off.</p>
<p>Looking into this case further, I see that here nothing of the sort applies. The two faces in question were clearly based only on the source typeface, not its sources - and they are, despite that, poor quality copies.</p>
<p>So, while I might still question whether there is any illegality involved, I definitely do agree that Gameloft ought not to be using a typeface of that sort instead of the real thing. In fact, if they <em>can&rsquo;t</em> negotiate reasonable terms for the use of the real thing (as they would be using it to create artwork, not to let users type words in the game, I presume, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to embed the font and enter into the stratospheric realms of that sort of licensing&hellip; but maybe they would need to embed it, say for scores and the like - I can&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> they&rsquo;re doing this to save $20) they would be better off buying a copy of Fontographer, and designing their own similar face.</p>
<p>Which could consist of one thing that Generation B, the real thing, seems to be conspicuously lacking for a face of this type&hellip; alternate characters.</p>
<p>(EDIT: Visiting the Harold&rsquo;s Fonts page, I see I was unfair; they do have &ldquo;big&rdquo; and &ldquo;small&rdquo; alternates for all the letters, at least.)</p>
<p>A face could have the same &ldquo;feel&rdquo; as that one but with different letters large, small, wedged left, wedged right, displaced upwards, displaced downwards, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I thought I&rsquo;d look around to see other faces that were similar, but I couldn&rsquo;t get closer than faces like Crazy Loot BTN, Mother Hen AOE, Mister Rii PB, MVB Hotsy Totsy, Perfect Magic Bold, and Harry Plotter, which were still all quite different.</p>
<p>EDIT: Although I didn&rsquo;t see any real match, when I saw the full actual face on the Harold&rsquo;s Fonts page, instead of making me think of My Little Pony, it made me think of Big Daddy Ed Roth - whose name I keep having trouble remembering.</p>

<p>I think all of us draw inspirations from others and while deriving your own work from others seems fine to a certain degree there&rsquo;s a fine line between inspiration and plagiarism.</p>
