  font metrics. And by this I mean to ask for the typography terminology, not the
  computer terminology.\r\n\r\nSorry that I am struggling with this request. I want
  to find a way to describe the height associated with the small-caps portion of some
  text that I have set for a project. I made  custom small caps by adjusting the font
  size and adding weight via stroke. The height is greater than the font's small cap
  format and the font's x-height, but smaller than true caps. Also,it's not a common
  fraction as it is relative to the size of the artwork when produced to avoid problems
  with scaling.\r\n\r\nI think the term I need is x-height, but I would like to verify
  that by looking at a diagram of professional typography terms.Is there such a term
  as xcap-height?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nI am a new
  member, but I have already learned so much from this site! Thanks.\r\n\r\nJase"
