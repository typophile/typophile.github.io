body: "Hi there, \r\nI am wondering how is the propper notation for dates, and what
  is the difference in Great Britain and the United States \u2013 if there is any
  difference at all. \r\n\r\nI have a wonderful reference book in German, which is
  called \"Detailtypografie\", but I couldn't find anything similar in English. \r\n\r\nI
  prepared a couple samples and I would like to know:\r\na) What is the proper way
  to write the date where (GB/US) \u2013 concerning both, the comma and the superscript?\r\nb)
  What is allowed/accepted?\r\nc) What shouldn't be used at all.\r\n\r\nAny comments
  appreciated.\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nPetra\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/date_question_v1_3852.jpg]"

  body: "Your best bet is probably to check with the style guide of your publisher,
    since there is very little standardisation even within the UK. For example, the
    [[http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/d#id-3033557|Guardian]] and the [[http://www.ox.ac.uk/branding_toolkit/writing_and_style_guide/typographic_formats.html#adates|Oxford
    University]] style guides both go for 27 January 2012, although I would normally
    write 27th January 2007 and see that far more often in non-professionally type-set
    documents. Then there is the question of whether you should write \u201Con the
    27th January\u201D or just \u201Con 27th January\u201D &c.\r\n\r\nAs a general
    principle, though, in the UK January 27th is much less common simply because we
    tend to say \u201C27th of January\u201D whilst Americans, I think, might say \u201CJanuary
    27th\u201D and write it that way. It\u2019s also why the mmddyyyy format is very
    confusing for those of us in the UK but less so in the States!"

  body: "Thanks Jacob for your input. My publisher has no written style guide for
    English language, that's why I am checking for the common usage. I consulted a
    couple books already, e.g. the Economist style guide, but I didn't find any satisfying
    answers. That's why I thought I could try posing it here.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPetra\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In formal writing, in the US, the ordinal \u201Cth\u201D would generally
    not be used. \r\n\r\nFor a range, most common would be \u201CJanuary 27\u201329,
    2012\u201D or \u201CFrom January 27 to 29, 2012, we will . . . \u201D\r\n\r\nFor
    a single date, most common would be \u201COn Sunday, January 27, 2012, we will
    . . . \u201D\r\n\r\nWhen reading aloud many readers will pronounce the numeral
    in ordinal form, but the abbreviation is generally not written explicitly.\r\n\r\nIf,
    however, the author insists on a structure that places the date before the month,
    as in examples 6 & 7, then in that case the ordinal would usually get expressed:
    \u201COn the 27th of January, 2012, we will . . . \u201D But these days, I expect
    most editors would encourage the less verbose, simpler form.\r\n\r\nAnd there
    are occasionally those American publishers which permit a more European convention:
    \u201COn 27 January, 2012, we will . . . \u201D But these are not common."

  body: "Sorry, I should have been clearer: what I meant by \u201C[I] see that far
    more often in non-professionally type-set documents\u201D, was that when people
    pass around Word documents, I see \u201C27th January\u201D (with superscripts)
    far more than \u201C27 January\u201D but far less so in books, newspapers and
    magazines. As that other thread suggested, the ordinals do look like a mess unless
    you have a font which includes ones that won\u2019t mess up the line-spacing. "

  body: In the UK it's definitely day, month, year, and I would avoid superscripts
    completely. I can't see a purposeful reason to give the suffix 'th' a special
    typographic treatment, although Word does this by default. It's not like we emphasise
    the 'th' when we speak it.
