  a re-design of a website and I've decided to use Clarendon for the site's branding.
  What I am looking for is a clean, complementary sans-serif font to pair with it,
  and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions? The site is for a News professional.
  \r\n\r\nThank you so much!"

    Sans]].\r\n\r\nBut you should probably clarify if you're talking about how the
    sans would be used (body text, menus, headings?) and how you're going to deploy
    the font (as graphics, as one or another form of web type?). "
