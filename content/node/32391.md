  is a OpenType humanist sans serif, both adaptable and lively. In smaller point sizes,
  the hairline weight of Agilita is so fragile, it pulsates with the possibility of
  disappearing and reappearing. The larger the point size of the hairline, however,
  the more it wants to take charge, its delicacy lifting off the page and grabbing
  the eye. In heavier weights, Agilita displays an amicable human robustness and warmth.
  This unique range of appearances from quivering playfulness to classic solidity
  gives Agilita an independence ideal for highly versatile design applications.\r\n\r\nAgilita
  is created by [[Juergen Weltin|J\xFCrgen Weltin]], who has already shown a talent
  for embracing diversity and adaptability in his designs. He received accolades for
  the clean, yet eye-catching strokes of his typeface <a href=\"http://www.typematters.de/TM_Yellow.html\">Yellow</a>,
  designed for the British Telecommunications directory, and has successfully merged
  the practical and whimsical side of lettering in such typefaces as <a href=\"http://www.typematters.de/TM_Finnegan.html\">Finnegan</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.typematters.de/TM_Balega.html\">Balega</a>.\r\n\r\nFirst
  sketches for Agilita were drafted early in 2000. J\xFCrgen Weltin made a point of
  designing clear descenders and ascenders to outline classic letter proportions for
  a\r\nmore definite word shape. The fine, distinct emphasis on the horizontals helps
  convey a functional yet dynamic humanism. OpenType features include old style figures
  and a unique @ sign all which go beyond the line and extend the playful movements
  of this limber typeface - no matter what the size or weight. All in all, the wide-range
  font family has 32 type styles and consists of ten weights from hairline to bold,
  plus six additional condensed styles.\r\n\r\nOf the ten Agilita weights, the lighter
  ones are certainly the most exhilarating. Hairline, Ultra Thin, Thin, and Extra
  Light - these four weights emphasize the power of\r\nAgilita's almost buoyant appearance.
  Printed in large sizes, these weights command the eye with their agility and expressive
  human characteristics. The Hairline and Ultra Thin styles have been especially designed
  for display use or for oversize texts in large-scale signage.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility
  and mobility of Agilita means it is also ideal for small detailed layouts or a wide
  range of other graphic design applications. For example, two sets of arrows are
  available in all weights for use in orientation systems and complex design or editorial
  projects, e.g. the special arrows and signs can also be used in dictionaries to
  add clarity to detailed entries. Designers will also find the corresponding condensed
  weights especially suitable for narrow columns and tables where horizontal space
  is scarce. In addition, tabular figures in light, regular, medium and bold share
  identical widths and are compatible with their italic counterparts, so no last minute
  line shifting or adjustments is required."
