  Type 1 and eventually render it archaic? If you already own a T1 font, is it fair
  to be expected to pay full price for the OpenType version when it becomes available?
  Any thoughts?'

  body: I may be biased but T1 has been archaic for ten years. What other technology
    are you using in your day-to-day graphic design work that&#39;s not been upgraded
    in 15 years?  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: I know I left that one open. But, if you&#39;ve been using the same eraser
    for 15 years, then you either have a very big eraser, don&#39;t use a pencil,
    or make very few mistakes. When it does wear out will you complain about ahving
    to buy a new one?

    <BR> <BR>In asnwer to Kevin&#39;s questions: <BR> <BR>OpenType will not render
    Type 1 archaic. OpenType exists because Type 1 <i>is</i> archaic. Eventually,
    operating system developers will simply stop supporting Type 1 fonts, along with
    all other 8-bit software. <BR> <BR>Will you be expected to pay full price for
    OpenType versions of fonts that you already license in Type 1 format? That will
    likely depend on individual font companies. Smaller companies who tend to have
    a better idea who owns legitimate licenes for fonts might provide an upgrade price,
    but I don&#39;t see how this would be possible for a large company whose library
    is cross-licensed to multiple resellers.'

  body: If you have a receipt of your purchase, or if you downloaded the font after
    purchaseing it from a vendor directly &#40;FontShop, Monotype, Linotype, etc&#41;
    I would recommend calling the company and asking them for a deal.

    reasons. OpenType can be used by unscrupulous foundries to extract more cash from
    their buyers. Or it can be used by free font designers to provide easy support
    across platforms and add additional features to those fonts. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I like OpenType, and I&#39;m not sure I can be bothered with worrying about how
    to produce vanilla TT or PS formats. <BR> <BR>How many drivers out their now know
    how their engines work or could fix them? I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be far more likely
    they&#39;d understand a Model T. But which would you choose? <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m
    not sure the reference to needing FontLab stands up to scrutiny. Many of the features
    that free font amateur designers would need &#40;and I&#39;m one of them&#41;
    can be accomplished by cheaper tools. TypeTool being the obvious one here as it  can
    export as OpenType &#40;TT outlines only though&#41;. How much does a $99 TypeTool
    license really mean when spending '

  body: 'Dan, <BR>why don&#39;t you go further? Isn&#39;t it limitation for type designers
    that they must buy and use expensive computers with very limited offer of operating
    systems? <BR> <BR>Your statement on Type 1 fonts is typical ethnocentric example
    of a member of the Euro American culture. Why do we need complex typefaces when
    256 glyphs in Type 1 was enough for many years etc. Let me argue with you. <BR>
    <BR>I am from the Czech Republic. As you probably noticed in Prague, we use many
    accented characters &#40;not available in Latin 1 Western encoding&#41;. Now imagine
    what does it mean to set multilingual text in archaic applications like QuarkXPress:
    you must have a particular typeface for each script or even for each language.
    It is possible to work this way with Type 1 fonts but the final result has a lot
    of problems: <BR> <BR>- you cannot export text edited in non Unicode application
    &#40;XPress&#41; back to Unicode text editor &#40;you can only choose one encoding
    for all the text&#41; <BR>- you cannot create correct and searchable PDF <BR>-
    you cannot export the text as HTML and publish it on the web <BR>- it is difficult
    or impossible to use the text in multilingual databases <BR>- it is problematic
    for blind people to use such a text <BR>etc. <BR> <BR>Unicode and OpenType fonts
    are a great advantage in many aspects: <BR>- they allow type designers to respect
    traditional ways of writing minor languages <BR>- they allow type designers to
    respect the history of particular typeface &#40;alternate versions of glyphs etc.&#41;
    <BR>- they allow and simplify multilingual communication &#40;one font for several
    languages&#41; <BR>- they are platform independent and they are not stored in
    multiple files  <BR>- they motivate type designers to know more about diacritics,
    about language specific issues etc. <BR>- they allow non Latin type designers
    to create compatible fonts with both major platforms from the rest of the World

    is a victory of multiculturalism and plurality over ethnocentrism and narrow mind
    of Western programmers.</b>'

  body: '<i>Some of the articles on Luc&#39;s site seems to postulate that the only
    pure font format is Type 1, because Type 1 is a &#40;more or less&#41; simple
    table that can be read and edited by almost anyone.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m one half
    of a very small font foundry, and I find making OpenType fonts much easier than
    Type 1 fonts. Yes, I had to learn a pile of stuff, but I actually think the file
    structure, the availability of tools for both making and testing, and the benefits
    of a single, cross-platform binary make OpenType simpler than Type 1. The irony
    of Luc&#39;s rather bizarre essay &#40;and note that he is not a font developer,
    so I don&#39;t know from what perspective he makes these assertions&#41; is that
    OpenType is a much more difficult proposition for large foundries with giant libraries
    of existing typefaces than for small foundries making new designs. Consider how
    long it took even Adobe to convert their library from Type 1 to OpenType: that
    is a major undertaking, requiring massive resources. Meanwhile, I&#39;ve been
    happily making OpenType fonts for six years, without having to worry about the
    problems of library conversion. I think small foundries are in a better position
    to take advantage of OpenType than many larger companies. If you look at the initial
    OpenType offerings from e.g. Linotype vs. Jeremy Tankard, it is clear that format
    conversion of a large library doesn&#39;t leave much opportunity to extend functionality,
    add cool new glyph variants and layout features, not to mention extended language
    support; whereas, conversion of a small, boutique font collection or development
    of new designs can involve much more creativity and new features.'

  body: Filip, I&#39;m totally for OpenType!&#42; I linked to, and paraphrased, the
    above articles to point out a different &#40;and in my opinion problematic&#41;
    point of view. I wanted to incite a discussion just like this one. <BR> <BR>With
    all of the good arguments, like the ones you pointed out in your posts, why do
    you think that some designers still cling to Type 1? Adobe hasn&#39;t made a Type
    1 font in over six years, but Font Shop makes Type 1 &amp; TrueType versions of
    its new releases, because Quark and Freehand users want them. While some people
    would argue that Adobe is trying to support its own innovation and products at
    the expense of other companies, others would argue that they are moving the industry
    forward. By still making fonts in old formats, are other foundries holding technology
    back? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m for moving forward, for many reasons. Aside from greater
    multi-lingual support, the creation of new typefaces in OpenType format makes
    for good business <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
