  body: "(I'd suggest the Critique section.)\r\n\r\nOffhand, the Q tail is odd, the
    B and R too thick at the curves joint, the e and s too narrow, the f ball too
    tight to the main stem, g ball too tight to the bowl and its diagonal too steep
    and thick, the tittles too small, the figure balls too small, 1 too short and
    the 7 stress backwards.\r\n\r\nI really like the k and would like to see that
    curviness in some other letters (it's there in e), possibly at the bottom of d,
    h, m, n and u, or even a 'u'ish y?\u2014as things stand at the moment it is one
    of many display didones, with not a lot of unique personality to call attention
    to itself.\r\n\r\nAlso, sounds too much like Bin Laden.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for you're feedback Stephen, and the quick analysis Nick \u2014 it's
    hard to get this sort of thing where I am.\r\n\r\nFunny you should mention the
    Osama/Otama link actually. A similar thing happened back in the early 2000s when
    a rather successful New Zealand band called Shihad were trying to make it big
    in the States. They were advised that their name was too similar to Jihad, so
    they changed their name. With the name change, they also lost their soul and turned
    to absolute rubbish. \r\n\r\nLuckily though, when they failed in the states and
    came back home, they changed their name back and are currently going better than
    ever.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I couldn't seem to put my finger on the word, but there is
    a definite shyness that flows through the design when compared with something
    like Linotype's Didot \u2014 which I see as having a very strong graphic execution
    and character. To me, Otama heads more down the lineage of H&FJ's Didot.\r\n\r\nI
    really like the flamboyant k too, but I've been looking at it (along with the
    g) as the character that is working the least from this quiet and shy perspective.
    Especially at subheading sizes from 14-24pt. It may be a stretch, but I'd like
    to try suggest that Otama has been influenced a lot by the philosophy and uniformity
    of grotesques like Helvetica and Gotham. Though shy is perhaps a more fitting
    and humane adjective than uniform.\r\n\r\nThanks again for giving me some things
    to think about."
