  the name of the \"NYC\" letters in this picture. I think it's the new NYC.gov font,
  but couldn't find good resources. This picture is taken of a New York City cab.
  They recently changed the look of the cabs so i was interested to see which font
  it was. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/light-taxista-bryant-park_4905.jpg]"
