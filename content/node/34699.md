  some help on this. I am redesigning my menu and marketing materials and I am looking
  for a contemporary font for use in marketing materials. Our marketing materials
  are understated and classic if that helps at all and I'd like to find something
  distinctive. \r\n\r\nAny and all suggestions would be appreciated. I consider myself
  skilled at putting together some reasonable layouts and copywriting but I'm not
  confident enough in my ability to select the best font.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBryan"

    - pedestrian (freightish a word?)\r\n\r\nUpscale should be something \"classy\"
    like a Carlton\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=carlton\r\n\r\nor
    an Egmont\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=egmont\r\n\r\nbut
    then again, it means what kind of \"upscale\" -- is this catering to the \"in\"
    crowd of the day? Is it catering to the money that is out there? What type of
    fare? What price range? Who are they trying to attract.\r\n\r\nAh, so many questions
    go into play before one picks out what would best marry the \"product\"....\r\n\r\nP.S.
    If it is just for the menu - I'd try to find a serif font that had a bold and
    an italic counterpart. I keep redesigning menus here, because the original designers
    didn't take into consideration - the 1) lighting of the restaurant and 2) the
    eyes of the customers.\r\n\r\nI just did an \"upscale\" seafood restaurant myself
    - they owners insisted on Caslon Antique for all their menu choices - but we gave
    the customers - Caslon Book for reading purposes...\r\n\r\nGood luck with the
    menu. There is more work involved then most are aware. Especially when you are
    all finished and the Chef says, \"wait a minute...\"\r\n\r\nP.P.S. You may want
    to show an example of the restaurant's logo - because you'll want a face that
    compliments... (or is that complements in this case?)"
