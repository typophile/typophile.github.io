  through this site, bought the font and love it, and want to make sure a draft colophon
  I put together seems sound to eyes and minds more experienced than my own.\r\n\r\n-
  - - -\r\n\r\nThis book has been set in LTC Metropolitan - a 2000 digitization by
  Gerald Giampa of the celebrated font \u201CCentaur\u201D drawn by Bruce Rogers in
  1914.\r\n\r\n\u201CCentaur\u201D was in turn a revival and interpretation of the
  earliest fonts of Venice - the 1475 Roman of Nicolas Jenson & the 1495 types of
  Francesco Griffo.\r\n\r\nFor the 1929 Monotype release, Rogers chose as accompanying
  italic the 1925 font \u201CArrighi\u201D of Frederic Warde, which had been inspired
  by the 1520 chancery cursive of Ludovico degli Arrighi.\r\n\r\n- - - -\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think - dates look right? Any boners?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"

    of Eusebius in 1470. (I'm not sure where 1475 comes from.) I've never heard of
    any reference to Francesco Griffo's work in relation to Centaur.\r\n\r\nA font
    of 14-point was commissioned by Henry Watson Kent for use by the Metropolitan
    Museum in New York, hence the name for Giampa's version.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "How to to this politely? Oh, hell, I've never been polite except by accident,
    & always fail worse when I try.\r\n\r\nCentaur, in PostScript, in text-size settings
    (say 11- 12-point) looks terrible in a book -- that is, when printed offset. It
    looks OK on laser proof, but that is a very different inking system.\r\n\r\nThis
    is not the fault of the printer. It is the fault of the designer for choosing
    the font for text.\r\n\r\nI've never used Metropolitan, but a quick look at samples
    on the website would make me cautious. YMMV.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIn passing, the
    1914 Metropolitan commission was not quite the same font as the Monotype machine
    versions usually listed as 1929."

  body: You should strive to make your usage consistent. I would shy away from quotation
    marks, but if clarity demands that you set apart the font names, go ahead and
    use italics, bold, small caps, or whatever works for you -- as long as all the
    font names including LTC Metropolitan are treated the same.

  body: "Let me second what both Kent & Charles have written. \r\n\r\nAs Kent suggests,
    you need to do a bit more reading about Centaur. For a very cursory telling of
    the tale, see\r\n\r\nhttp://harvardmagazine.com/web/extras/bruce-rogers-centaur\r\n\r\nYou
    might also look for a copy of the book \"Centaur Types.\" Rogers wrote it and
    supervised composition and printing in the late 1940s. A few years ago some copies
    came on the market.\r\n\r\n& Charles is right about Centaur in text settings.
    It is an abomination. Carefully spaced in display settings it can be OK if paired
    with the right text face. Unfortunately, too many people have heard in design
    class that Centaur is one of the great types. & that is true of the metal version,
    if it is well printed. But they have been taught very little about how to evaluate
    a classic type in versions other than the one it was designed for. So they use
    it. \r\n\r\npowers\r\n"

  body: "Michael,\r\n\r\nI don't know if you are still reading this thread, and while
    I do think the criticisms expressed here are valid, it isn't like we all didn't
    make similar mistakes (if you agree they are such) along the way, & usually repeat
    them in slightly different ways, every day.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to learn to think
    about media, esp. when something like \"print\" isn't one media. Papers differ,
    and take the ink differently. Technologies differ, e.g., metal and photocomp,
    as do their usual parings, letterpress & offset -- though metal comp is occasionally
    printed offset, & photocomp printed with polymer plates. Xerography is different
    still, as is the computer screen. Viewed this way there are a lot of different
    medias, even though they are often lumped into just two.\r\n\r\nNo one I know
    is an expert in all these areas. And our expectations of type are such that the
    type itself is not what matters, it is the \"printing\" that counts. In learning
    our craft, we all have, and continue to stumble, usually more often that we succeed.\r\n\r\nSo
    write you colophon, keep on working, & we hope you will keep on posting to typophile.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nCharles"
