body: "My work is mainly big headings (80 pt type say) and small body copy (12 pt).
  However the most easily readable text typefaces don't add much personality to my
  pieces and since there are only those two kinds of type I have been feeling that
  I need to add some personality to my body copy (usually only a paragraph). So here
  are the problems with using display type for my body copy paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. readability
  is diminished\r\n2. some times it fills in when reversed out\r\n3. some times it
  fills in when screen printed (not the end of the world since my look is very organic)\r\n\r\nWhat
  can I do?\r\n\r\nThe only other thing I can think of doing is making the body copy
  paragraph bigger but then the heading loses dominance.\r\n\r\nPlease make suggestions!"

  body: "1. Season your body copy with: Drop/raised cap, small caps, italicization,
    em/en dash rather than comma, swashes, quaints.\r\n2. Experiment with leading
    and rag.\r\n3. Surely you can find some sturdy body types with a bit of personality!
    (Hint: I've made a few.)\r\n4. Apply a teensy bit of \"stroke\" to the text to
    beef it up."

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nThese are great suggestions.. I have to admit that I don't know
    what a quaint is?\r\n\r\nYou are absolutely right about the leading and rag that
    should do the trick and a few swashes would not hurt either!"
