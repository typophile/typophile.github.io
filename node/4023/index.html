		<div class="commentbody">Instead of 100% black for type, how about a mixture of 50/50/50/50 (that's a guess). That could screw up hairlines on serif type, even without mis-registration.  <BR> <BR>You could combine this technique with &quot;graded&quot; fonts such as Poynter Oldstyle (from the Bureau), one version in 100% black on one layer, another, heavier version in 50/50/50/0 on a back layer. <BR> <BR>I've designed several faces that incorporate stylized distress that mimics the effect of letterpress type &ndash; Brown, Paradigm, Worldwide, Walburn. (All on view at shinntype.com.) <BR> <BR>There is a difference between stylized distress and raw, random distress: classic in this genre is Poliphilus. More recently Founder's Caslon. <BR> <BR>And finally, why not use real letterpress?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Physical things like letterpress get obsolete much, much slower than something like a font format! :-) More than <i>use</i>, however, most people who use letterpress these days are in fact <i>abusing</i> it. They use its tactile quality as a reactionary escapism from the coldness of the digital world. Valid feelings, but spawning invalid expressions. If this all sounds obscure (it would have to me about 1.5 years ago), it just means you have to get to know letterpress first-hand, and see the contemporary conflict between sensationalism versus substance evolving. It causes things like Tiffany &amp; Co. to commission a letterpess-looking version of their logotype for friggin' $10,000 (never mind that it will generally be applied with foil stamping).

		<div class="commentbody">There are still quite a few people printing lettrpress in a private press environmnet. A great many of them doing very good work. As Hrant has stated: some doing awful work by over-impressing, and some doing the same by attempting to kiss-impress and under-ink. <BR> <BR>I am not aware of anyone successfully offering letterpress commercially in Canada, other than in the capacity of numbering and perfing. <BR> <BR>I occasionally conduct workshops in letterpress and in typecutting. The workshop I instructed at the ATypi conference in Vancouver last Fall had only one attendee . . .  from Australia. <BR> <BR>I am instructing a Chicago man for a few days at my workshop in May in punch and matrix cutting. <BR> <BR>Yesterday a man from Washington state called me and we talked at length about a book he is having letterpressed at Steinhour Press using polymer plates. The book is a good size; around 100 pages. He was looking for a type that looked like it had letterpess roots, and was considering Lanston Type Co.'s Metropolitan. (Since Metropolitan was had digitized directly from the Lanston patterns, I felt that it was as good a choice as any).  <BR> <BR>I am in the midst of a personal project: the limited edition printing of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I've cut a new metal type for the book. I am anticipating making about 100 or so copies. <BR> <BR>In my part of the world there are two very fine letterpress printers: Barbarian Press and Heavenly Monkey Press, both very active. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR>   <BR> <BR></div>
