body: "I tried running the images through several font matching sites, but the results
  were kind of all over the place.\r\n\r\nThe first looks like Nimbus Sans with the
  exception of the terminals. The second image looks like Helvetica, again except
  the terminals.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!"

    to be a modification of Chalet New York 1960, by House industries:\r\nhttps://houseind.com/hi/chalet\r\n\r\nThe
    smaller sample is indeed Helvetica Bold:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/"
