  body: For CS3 and earlier you would need to use InDesign ME, the version of InDesign
    sold by WinSoft that is modified for setting Middle Eastern languages. For CS4
    and later, the western-language InDesign has a hidden Arabic typesetting ability
    that you can activate with templates, scripts, or plug-ins.

  body: "The OP is working in CS3 ...\r\n\r\n<cite>I've tried using several Arabic
    fonts in CS3 and am having trouble getting the characters to connect properly
    (they don't connect at all).</cite>\r\n\r\nCorrect. By default, when you type
    a single character, InDesign picks the \"Isolated\" form, whereas software designed
    to work with Arabic automatically use the \"Initial\", \"Medial\", and \"Final\"
    character forms. If you want to do this by hand: it's not <em>very</em> complicated,
    but it's a lot of work: select each character, one by one, and look in the Glyphs
    panel for its alternates. Then pick the appropriate one, by hand. Take care in
    selecting the correct ones: the <em>right hand side</em> is -- in Arabic Right-to-Left
    writing -- the \"Initial\"; all inbetweenies are \"Medials\", and the <em>left
    hand side</em> is the \"Final\".\r\n\r\nNote that not all characters come in all
    4 shapes; for example, Times New Roman only has Isolated and Final forms for the
    Alef. I *think* (but I could be dearly mistaken) that the Final form should only
    be used as such, so in this case you should use the only alternative everywhere
    else.\r\n\r\nI hope you have a good example to work from ... It might be faster
    and more accurate to do this in Word, print to PDF, and insert as image."

    recommend this for any serious work, proper Arabic shaping has more than piking
    initial/medial/final glyphs (and Arabic characters have infinite number or forms
    not only four, the only limit is what subset the type designer choose to put in
    his font), not to mention ligatures (for fonts that have them) or mark positioning."

  body: "Khaled: of course. It's as tricky as the OP's \"typing in backwards\".\r\n\r\nFor
    any serious work, one needs the ME version of InDesign -- I'm not sure if CS4's
    undocumented World Composer hack (and the associated scripts and templates) behaves
    exactly the same as \"the real thing\" does.\r\n\r\nCan you rate how good Word
    is with its Arabic typesetting?"

  body: I don't use Word myself (or InDesign) but MS's OpenType engine is the "canonical"
    implementation and it is known for its good complex text support. I've seen some
    quirks with Kashida justification with Office 2007, no idea if it were fixed in
    later versions.
