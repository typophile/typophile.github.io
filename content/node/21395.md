  like TNR skewed to me, the rest looks more like some sort of Garalde, but let's
  face it: I'm lost and I need the help of pros, such as the good people of the Typophile
  Type ID Board. Have at it please! Any assistance is much appreciated.  "

    kicks in whenever the intended font cannot be found.

  body: "Ok. Wow. That would explain, why I couldn't find anything like it.\r\n\r\n*blank_stare*\r\n\r\nNow
    why would anyone go and print their business cards in Adobe Serif? And (much more
    to the point) what font was it *supposed* to be set in? And how come nobody noticed,
    when it wasn't?\r\n\r\nMysteries upon mysteries, I shall go and investigate, thanks
    for your help, everyone!"

    I've asked myself those exact questions. People just don't notice (or they don't
    care)."

  body: "They don't notice.\r\n\r\nI witnessed an incident that involved two headings
    printed on paper \u2014 one in Arial and the other in Times New Roman. When I
    asked why the person had changed the title font inside the document, the only
    thing he noticed was that the Times heading was larger (it was a higher level
    heading), made it a little smaller and bold, printed it again and was happy.\r\n\r\nFor
    him, \u201Cfont\u201D meant the size and they both looked identical to him when
    bolded (they were all caps, by the way)."
