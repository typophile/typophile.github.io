  anyone knows of  a font version of this or has any other information, I would be
  extremely grateful!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/identifont_4949.gif]\r\n\r\nIt's
  a left-leaning modern script from the cover of an old theater playbill from the
  1930s.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and have a beautiful day.\r\n\r\nHoward\r\n\r\n"

  body: I can think of similarly flavored scripts that lean right (<a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/Radio/mudTyper+Weights/">Radio</a>)
    and don't lean at all (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/coquette/">Coquette</a>)
    but not left.
