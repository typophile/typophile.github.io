  body: You'd think that a printer's fair at the International Printing Museum would
    utilize some metal or wood type from their archive rather than digital types.

  body: "I thought that Rosewood fill looked familiar! Not sure if it really looks
    good on its own.\r\n\r\nI agree on the digital irony. But I'm not complaining
