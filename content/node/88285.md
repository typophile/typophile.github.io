  appreciate some guidance on correct styling of footnotes reference numbers, both
  within the text and the numbers next to the footnotes themselves.\r\n\r\nThroughout
  I'm using \"proportional old-style\" numerals, and I'd normally aim to not mix old-style
  with the default figures. However the font (Hoftype Cala) I'm using has the option
  of \"OpenType Superior/Superscript\" (in InDesign character style under Basic Character
  Formats > Position drop down).\r\n\r\nShould I use this setting for the superscript
  footnote references? Even though those aren't old-style figures? And should I do
  the same for the footnote number alongside the footnote itself?\r\n\r\nthanks very
  much!\r\nMichael"

  body: 'Yes. Unless the fonts contain old style superior/inferior figures (I don''t
    know of any besides one of mine, but there sure are), go with the ones included
    in the font. These are better than scaling a set of old style figures to fit,
    because the weight will be all wrong. For the listing, lining figures are useful
    for marking the hierarchy: the listing numbers lining, the numbers in the notes
    old style. '

  body: "Yes and yes. Then, as always, you should look how well they work in your
    setting, and fine-tune your style accordingly.\r\nAs an example, in one layout
    I did using Chaparral as text font, I used the less proper numerator Open Type
    option because it sits lower and I had a pretty tight leading. Also, I bumped
    up a bit its size."

    or \u201Cmicro\u201D) font for the footnotes, I would suggest that the numbers
    in the footnotes be full size, rather than superscript. Otherwise they may be
    too slight.\r\n\r\nBut really, if you\u2019re going to the trouble of using proper
    superscript reference numbers, you should also be using a size-specific font for
    the footnotes themselves.\r\n\r\nWith Cala, which has no \u201Copticals\u201D
    per se, you could use Light for the main text, and Regular for the footnotes,
    with relative sizing &c. that produces the effect of similar weight."

  body: 'I would second the recommendation not to put the figures in the footnotes
    themselves in superscript: it''s what you''re looking for at the bottom of the
    page, so there''s really no point in making them small. If you have the space,
    another nice detail is to have the footnote text indented slightly, as they do
    <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=4fDj5mcAXgkC&lpg=PP1&dq=heinzelmann&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false">here</a>
    (although they unfortunately superscript the reference in the footnote itself).'
