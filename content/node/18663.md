body: I'm not sure if Adam's around, but maybe someone else might have an idea on
  this one. I'd like to add some custom Unicode codepoints to FontLab's Unicode list
  so that rather than entering the codepoints for each individual smallcap glyph I
  can use the Glyph > Glyph Names > Generate Unicode command. I use Adobe's values
  listed in their <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt"
  target="_blank">Glyph List</a> and I'd like to add all the smallcap glyph names
  and codepoints to FL's list so that they're available to the Generate Unicode command.
  So, my question is, where does FL store it's Unicode list and can it be edited/added-to?

  body: "Nevermind, found it. Looks like it's either a matter of using the same glyph
    names as listed in FL's Standard list (or one of the additional optional lists),
    or editing one of the lists to suit your own custom glyph naming (keeping a back-up
    of the edited file, of course).\r\n "

  body: "If you're on a Mac and FL5 then go to Library>Application Support>FontLab>Mapping
    and open the standard.nam file and save a copy of it. Don't change it as FL allows
    you to have custom files elsewhere. Open the copy in a text editor and you'll
    see a Unicode list in the format \"0x000 glyph name\". For example: \"0x0120 Gdotaccent.\"
    \ Make your list in the same format by adding to the copy. Be sure and change
    the header to reflect that it's a new file and save it as plain text under a new
    name with the extension .nam. Then put it in (User Name)>Library>Application Support>FontLab>Mapping.
    When you start FL it should reflect the additional names.\r\n\r\nOf course small
    caps -- like any non-Unicode glyphs -- don't need Unicode points, and Adobe recommends
    not using numbers from the PUA since there is no standard for their use. This
    is despite the fact they use them. If you're being anal about your small caps
    then you're making two sets, one that maps to uppercase glyphs (c2sc) and one
    that maps to lower case glyphs (smcp) which runs into more work than you need
    in terms of codepoints. As long as your encoding includes the small caps you should
    be fine.\r\n\r\nWhat's more important is have your own encoding that includes
    all the characters you want in your font. Once you have your full glyph set then
    in Names Mode save the encoding with a unique name and the extension .ENC to the
    folder (user name)>Library>Application Support>FontLab>Encoding. You can have
    several different encoding files reflecting different glyph sets say ones that
    includes Greek or Cyrillic or ornaments, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat's also helpful is to
    have your own \"alias.dat\" file that includes all unique glyphs like the small
    caps accent glyphs. For instance if you create your small caps as glyphname.smcp
    or some other extension, this isn't in the alias file so trying to generate atilde.smcp
    doesn't work. \r\n\r\nMake a copy of the alias.dat file from Library>Application
    Support>FontLab>Data to (user name)>Library>Application Support>FontLab>Data,
    then open it in a text editor and follow the format of the file to add unique
    characters. It should be \r\natilde.smcp a.smcp+tilde. This allows you to use
    Generate Glyphs command to make these. Again be sure you don't overwrite the original
    alias.dat file.\r\n\r\nI hope I explained this satisfactorily; if not let me know.
    It isn't that hard to do and as long as you don't futz with the original files
    any mistakes are fixable.\r\n\r\nGeorge\r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes,
    until I met a man who had no Bodoni"

  body: "Hi George,\r\n\r\nThanks for all the input; as usual, shortly after posting
    I discovered most of what you've described, but your reply also raised another
    issue: making two sets of small caps. I'm unclear on this front. What I've done
    in the past is use the same set of small cap glyphs for both the c2sc and smcp
    OT features. Are you suggesting this is cheating? What, exactly, is the importance
    of having two sets of the same glyphs? (If that's what you were suggesting.)"

  body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nSo, essentially what you're saying is don't Unicode my small
    caps? (I don't see any values for them in the AGLFN.) Is this because, somewhere
    down the line, Unicode values will actually be assigned to small caps and thus
    using custom values (or Adobe's values) will eventually create a conflict?"

    to customize the suffix that FL appends to incoming glyphs? For instance, if I'm
    merging a font of small caps into the base font, and I select FL's option to append
    the incoming glyphs, can I change the default suffix of .001 to, say, .smcp?"

  body: "As for your first question, you can assign Private Use Area Unicode codepoints
    to all your unencoded glyphs such as small caps (it's easiest through Glyph /
    Glyph Names / Generate Unicode / Assign PUA) but you don't need to stick to any
    \"standards\" there, because there aren't any. You may, if you really desperately
    want, assign the PUA codepoints that Adobe has specified in their Corporate Use
    Area as listed in the Adobe Glyph List, but even Adobe doesn't stick to these
    assignments anymore. PUA assignments are by definition arbitrary and nobody relies,
    or should rely, on the fact that a particular kind of glyph gets a particular
    PUA codepoint that is consistent across fonts. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
