body: "It seems that if people omit the 'http://' in their home page link on the profile
  view, the link is just appended to the current page link when clicked, so it shows
  up like\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/user/www.userpage.com\r\n\r\nIt's not the end
  of the world, but it's quite annoying. Is it possible to fix?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've
  just discovered (by trying to add a home page link to my profile) that Typophile
  no longer allows just writing, for example, www.userpage.com into the field: you
  have to put the http:// too. Could this problem be from some earlier version of
  Typophile, where the input field was less picky?"
