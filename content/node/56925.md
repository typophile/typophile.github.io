  musical and theater\r\nentertainment for the 50+ demographic.\r\n\r\nWhat typefaces
  can you suggest to me\r\nthat have fun, energetic qualities, yet\r\nstill bold and
  professional that would\r\ncater to the 50+ demographic? Serif or\r\nsans, I'm looking
  for pretty much\r\nanything at this point.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to hearing
  your\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\u2014Sobering"

  body: "GREAT suggestion Florian. Expo Serif Pro is indeed an astonishingly beautiful
    and complete Pro family that would suit Sobering's demographics. I might use it
    myself on some project. Never saw it before, so thank you.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
