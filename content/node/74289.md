  body: Extremely hard to read, but visually interesting. I would say try re-posting
    this without "truly wicked" written anywhere to gauge how many people can actually
    read it.

    styles such as Old English.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldEnglishT_5559.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    vertical stem of the T might also improve the R"

    could serve as the stem for the R and the D.\r\n\r\nWICKED is more apparent than

  body: "Here's what I meant by the more \"independent\" vertical, that sticks with
    the D at the end but gets read as part of the R rather than the T at the front.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truly_6033.png]"

  body: Look, here's how you do it. Make a whole, solid vertical that will be the
    left stem of the R and the left stem of the D. Connect it at the top of the R
    and the top of the D. Leave the bottom of the D open (but not too open) to keep
    the T separate, and, of course, the bottom of the R will be open to keep the E
    separate. A reader's grouping of shapes into letters is biased toward the cues
    at the top.
