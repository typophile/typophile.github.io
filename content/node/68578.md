  body: "I think you are right. There is a newer version called NuSwift (designed
    in 1995), which must have very subtle variations from the earlier Swift (designed
    in 1985) by Gerard Unger. Honestly, I can't tell the difference with my uncalibrated
    eyeballs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Apparently, that should be spelled 'Neue Swift'. According to [[http://www.linotype.com/6093/neueswift.html|this
    page]] on the Linotype site, Unger designed Swift 2.0 (now distributed by ParaType),
    which was refined into Neue Swift, as an Open Type design for Linotype.\r\n\r\nAs
    I read it the variations are very minor, and were made because of certain shortcomings
    of the URW Ikarus digitization tool first used to digitize Swift.\r\n\r\n- Mike
