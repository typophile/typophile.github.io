  am actually looking to know the name of a typeface I am interested in using in a
  project but I cannot figure it out.\r\n\r\nIs the Serif used in the New York Times
  magazine recently in the past few months.\r\n\r\nI would like to know the name of
  it if possible.\r\nI will see if I can post a picture of it.\r\n\r\nThanks ,\r\n\r\n\r\nCristian"
