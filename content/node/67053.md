  It was slightly modified by Froben, of Basle, who adopted the peculiar mannerism--probably
  imitated from Gothic forms--mentioned above, of having his types 'cut on their backs.'\"\r\n\r\nWhat
  does he mean that the types were cut on their backs?"

    of the nick.\r\n\r\nBut this \"imitated from Gothic forms\" clearly indicates

    is said to devote considerable space to Johann Froben, whose chief claim to fame
    appears to have been scooping the Elzevirs with a Greek New Testament by underhanded
    means.\r\n\r\nUpdike says that the printers of Basle generally used a \"squarish\"
    style of Roman type..."

    a Google search do look like they have heavy northwest-to-southeast bits (see
