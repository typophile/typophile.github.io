  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Recently, I've been toying with the idea of returning to the project that brought me to Typophile in the first place: To make a characterful text font. My <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/91743">first attempt</a> failed almost immediately, but I've learned a lot about type design in the meantime. 

I'd like to make <strong>Traction</strong> the female hiking boot of oldstyle fonts: Sturdy and functional, a grippy all-terrain profile, yet organic and human, and within the constraints of practicality as elegant and sexy as possible. The main "bite" should come from bold, almost exaggerated serifs, reminiscent of slab serifs, and broken strokes that reinforce the glyph where it is most needed.

My main inspirations are Quadraat, Marlene, and most importantly, Satyr. I'm avoiding looking at those typefaces now in order not to plagiarize them too much. Hopefully my own take will ultimately stand on its own rather than look like an obvious derivative.

Here are my first two letters:

Originally, I had more of an inward curve in the right leg, but it looked wobbly and made an unwanted "jolly" impression. I suppose I could give the leg an outward curve, but then wouldn't it basically be the Satyr {n}?

I'm also tempted to make the serifs longer, but then sequences of {n} start to look too loosely spaced.

Anyway, here's yesterday's progress:

A typeface like this is just asking for dozens of ligatures and swashes, should be lots of fun!</div>

With that adjustment to /t/ at the bottom, should you revisit the outstrokes of /c/ and /e/?

FWIW I think the /n/ structure is sufficiently unconservative. Maybe the head serif, which strikes me as interestingly long, could be a bit more thick.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like the top serifs, the 'b', the 't', the 'e', and the general feel of it. I'm curious to what kind of 's' you have in mind. Maybe the 'd' and 'a' is a little tight in their southern junctions? That might be unproblematic at larger sizes, but I would have let in some air down there anyway. Personally, I'd open up the bottoms of 'n' et al too, but that is a matter of taste. 

It is not a bad idea making the right leg of 'n' more similar to the back of the 'a', I think. Don't worry about being derivative. All designers are inspired by other people's work. When I drew Satyr I had Mrs. Eaves (!) in mind. 

Keep up the good work!

@ Joshua: I've given the outstroke-type serif on {n} a chance, but didn't like it. I feel like the glyph is tap-dancing (see below). Not at all what I'm going for...  I think I'll stick to my merely moderately unusual {n} for now.  ;o)

And while I love ligatures, I'm not sure this it the right font for going crazy with them.  I'll certainly have some non-standard ones like {tt, Th, Qu} and the like, but apart from that? Do you have an example of what you're thinking about?

@ Craig: I gave the top of the {t} just a little nudge upwards... wouldn't want to go farther than that; I'm a big fan of low and wide {t} designs.  Added weight to the bottoms of {e} and {c}; looks better indeed. 

Yes, the top serif of {n m r} exemplifies this rubber sole grip feeling I'm trying to evoke. Added two units to the thickness of the top serif in ; tried more but it started to look out of place.

@ Sindre: I haven't really thought about the {s} yet; I'll see when I get there.  ;o)  

I made the {a} wider by 10 units and broke the foot away from the bowl. Yep, big improvement. {d} was a lot airier than my previous {a}, though, so I left it unchanged for now.

I tried reducing the inside serifs on {n}, but didn't like the resulting feel of {nn} sequences. Reducing serifs in a grippy font just seems off anyway.  ;o)

Oh, and this will totally need a higher-contrast display cut sooner or later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're right, that serif isn’t working. Perhaps if was a bit smoother and dipped below the baseline? However, I do believe the regular 'n' is fine :)

I was thinking swashes in the italic mostly, but also some others along the lines of 'gy' and archaic letters/ligatures.

@ Joshua: Textura has been a strong influence on most of my fonts so far, so I'm not surprised to see it seep into this one as well. It's certainly welcome.  :)

@ Hrant: Yeah, you're right about the descenders. I expanded them a bit. The font is now 1050 ems tall; that's no problem these days, right?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T6_4959.png]

I'm getting a bit of a "sloppy" vibe off the last few characters. I guess I shouldn't have finished them at night... maybe I should make some of those strokes straighter after all?

After some more experimentation, I abandoned that bearded {f} design for a pretty Garalde banner. I think I can get away with it, especially since it also appears in {y}, where the "beard" just looked really stupid. I'm wondering whether I should also turn {j}'s descender into a banner...?  I do like the current look, though.

Hmmm... is {b} a bit too rotund?</div>

Non-1000-upm fonts are rarely a problem these days. But not never...
Really, if you're that close to 1000, spend the time making it fit.
But first: what's your talus (internal leading), at top and bottom?

If I don't make it into a corner but just shift the weight there, it works, but I think I prefer the original design with its emphasis on the horizontal stroke.

I'm not sure I feel like rescaling all letters at this point. I don't know what a talus is, and I don't recall seeing a field to that effect in Glyphs.  I thought it just made the line height equal to the span between descender depth and ascender height...?

Incidentally, do I need looser spacing, at least for the non-display versions?

I'm wary of skewing the middle of {B}. A lot of fonts do it, one way or the other, and I usually don't like it. Anyway, up close, the current {B} already looks quite dynamic:

		<div class="commentbody">@ AL: Good point about the "beards" — they don't have exactly straight sides, but they look like that in comparison with the more pronounced curves everywhere else.  I'll give them a bit of concavity.

How is the {ß} forced? It's the same architecture that Garamond and Palatino use, for instance. I much prefer this over the Sulzbacher form, and it's nicely "grippy", too.

As for Satyr: Sindre himself told me not to worry about the similarity...  and seeing the two fonts side-by-side, I find them very distinct from each other. I suspect Satyr might end up begetting an entire generation of new fonts in this style, as did Frutiger...  I'd like to christen this kind of fonts "organic serifs", while I'm at it.  ;o)  The non-straight stroke boundaries remind me of how trees grow additional material wherever the mechanical strain is greatest, rather than just following a geometric ideal.

@ Hrant: I haven't yet seen a talus feature in Glyphs... though I'm sure it must be around somewhere. I'll ask.</div>

Palatino Nova (bottom) makes ‘ß’ look less like a ‘ſ+s’ ligature, which I think is a good thing. If you change anything, I would go in that direction.</div>

I agree with the eszet advice you're getting; it should be one thing.

BTW, we <em>will</em> need to find a good term for this style. My eternally-gestating Paphos fits in there too.

		<div class="commentbody">Alright, I finished my first weight, including small caps, figure sets, arrows, kerning, ligatures, contextual alternates; the works.

However, I'm a bit disappointed at what the font looks like when used for text.  It strikes me as too black and too vertical.  I might have accidentally made the display companion to the Traction text face!  :\  I'm hoping this might get better once I have a spectrum of weights.  I might then declare the current weight Medium and have a Regular, Book, and Light to make for nicer text setting.  Maybe I should also make a dedicated text cut with wider rounds and looser spacing.

First of all, though, I plan to build an italic for my current weight.  I have some unconventional ideas already.  ;)

@ Hrant: I disagree about the corner in the capital Eszett; it reads as a TZ ligature for me.  However, I gave mine a "shoulder" on the upper left, which considerably improves its looks as a capital letter.  Thanks!

That /a/ is indeed crazy but the /g/ may be worth playing with more. The monocular /g/ is I think the least handsome letter to my eyes.

It's tempting to keep the sort-of-binocular (sesquiocular?) {g}, but wouldn't it be at odds with the single-storey {a} then? Or should I try to come up with a more handsome monocular {g}?

I've tried tinkering with the baseline serifs, but they immediately start looking too low to my eyes if I budge them...

<em>Do you intend to force weights to the same advance width?</em> — Not really, it just came out that way in this quick-and-dirty tryout. Actually, weight change is something I've never really done successfully (I did it for Backstein, where it was much easier than usual, and still I didn't like the results much).

You can see a specimen of the current weight here:
http://www.cinga.ch/type/Traction_specimen.pdf

Clearly, this weight is too heavy for body copy. It will probably end up as the Medium, with a lighter Regular and Book intended for body copy, as well as Light, Thin, Semibold, Bold, and Black for editorial work. I do see the Medium as sort of the default weight for branding, though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,

I just saw this now, and really like the look. It also reminds me a bit of Michael Harveys work, like Ellington (consider it a compliment, I love Ellington).

The only thing that keeps bothering me is the S, especially the capital version. The bump in the curve irritates me, and as a whole it looks a bit unbalanced to me (a bit top-heavy perhaps). I am no pro, just a type geek, and would like your perspective on this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I also like that /S a lot, so it's not going anywhere.  ;o)  The bump used to carry too much weight, but I think I've addressed that problem. I might still lift the spine just a bit to see if it is, indeed, top-heavy.

Working on the display cut skews my perception of the text cut — it strikes me as all chunky and fuzzy now when viewed at large sizes. Well, I guess that's what display cuts are for!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The display cut is pretty much finished now, I intend to give it its final polish and release it within the year. 

Meanwhile, work on the weight spectrum of the text cut is progressing, albeit slowly:

http://typedrawers.com/discussion/386/traction-a-text-font-with-grip-and-bite-in-development#latest

I'm glad to see that the "chunkiness" and "gnarliness" that the default weight of the text cut suffered from when set in multi-line text blocks is amended by interpolating down to lighter weights. I still think it needs to become a bit sleeker and lighter for comfortable reading, but for that I'm planning to widen the sidebearings. Maybe I should also tone down the fat terminals a bit in the text version...?

		<div class="commentbody">It's interesting to ponder: does the bigger size of a display cut mean that, with the constraints of running text removed, the quirks are free to be bolder? Or does the bigger size mean that the quirks need not be so bold to be easily seen?
I imagine that can only be well answered if the given function is more specific (What <em>kind</em> of bigger text is this?). 
I'm thinking particularly of that corner in the /s/. Would a more subtle treatment be useful at these sizes?</div>

I would say that, at least theoretically, it is not necessarily the same "quirks" (actually: features) that need to be tamed versus emboldened between text and display.
