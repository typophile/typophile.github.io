  body: Wouldn't surprise me. Safari has a pretty strict performance over features

    closet Apple-berserker talk? There most certainly are fractional pixels, on many
    levels. <em>Especially</em> on an OS that worships wysiwyg!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    then, for max performance just snap to powers of 2!\r\nWho <em>really</em> needs
    9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 point anyway?\r\nI'm sure the right kind of press
