  for a long time, but now i'm back on track, so i hope you are all still interested
  in what i'm doing here. \r\ni made several changes. the most important thing is
  that i reduced the cap-height, but there are many other, more subtle changes, that,
  i hope, improve legibility.\r\nall other styles will be coming soon\u2026\r\n\r\nand
  hrant, i just read your post from dec. 4th again, and in retrospect i'm not really
  sure what you meant with your \"macro suggestion\" (->adding shears). maybe you
  could elaborate on this (if you still remember)? ;-)\r\n\r\nas always, all critique
  is welcome.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance and so long\u2026\r\nhanno"

  body: "I use \"macro\" in crits simply to mean global stuff that applies\r\nto a
    face as a whole, as opposed to \"micro\" which is generally\r\nfor individual
    glyphs.\r\n\r\nI think the tail of the \"J\" should be stronger than anything
    up top.\r\nStill love that \"Q\"! :-)  \r\n\r\nI don't like the top of the bowl
    of the \"a\" - somewhow it seems undecided whether it's going straight or curling
    up slightly. I think the \"f\" could be less shy. The dots of \"i\" and \"j\"
    are out of character; try make them a square but with the top edge at an angle
    (the same angle as the stem shears). The top of the eszet is too square. The angles
    on your grave and acute are very shallow - why?\r\n\r\nThe numeral \"4\" seems
    a bit wide. And I think if you put that terminal on the seven, you should think
    about doing the same to the \"2\" and/or \"5\".\r\n\r\nLastly: the vertical proportions,
    combined with the overall spacing* make me think that this needs to be slightly
    darker. Don't let my tough-in-spots crit discourage you though - when completed
    I think this face has a fighting chance to gain some recognition.\r\n\r\n* Your
    blank space is a bit too wide though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "This looks really good!\r\n\r\nSome micro crits :-)\r\n1. The 8 is slightly
    too dark. 2 is slightly too light.\r\n2. The s is a little too wide.\r\n3. l (lowercase
    L) has slightly too might space on the right sidebearing (this is the tradeoff
    of a design with a tail). Especially next to combinations where it should be kerned
    (lt, lw)\r\n4. y is too dark in the crotch (the joint). I know this is a trademark
    letter, but I think it needs modification if this is to work in text. Perhaps
    a more traditional version of text? Y doesn't happen often in german :-) Not so
    in english.\r\n5. c also a little too wide.\r\n6. I don't like the comma/quotes.
    They are not long enough and too chunky. Too much like fat fake quotes!\r\n\r\nAnd
    macro crit:\r\nI agree with that the overall spacing is not right. Optimize the
    spacing for 9-12 point. I also think the word space is too big. I disagree that
    you need to make it darker*. Just track the sidebarings out a little bit and close
    up the word space.\r\n\r\n*You might even make it lighter. This will help with
    interpolation later.\r\n\r\nGood stuff!\r\nR"

  body: "Dear Hanno Bennert,\r\n\r\nI see it is wider than the version 1., and it
    has a better x-height.\r\nSome curves are stiff, the bottom part of \u2018S\u2019,
    and the \u20185\u2019, as for the\r\nfive I prefer the previous version vith the
    oblique stroke.\r\nAgree on consistency as it has been pointed.\r\nThe \u2018B\u2019
    is too wide for me now, I\u2019d go back to version 1. for it.\r\nIs the \u2018T\u2019
    little bit out of the cap height ?\r\n\u20184\u2019 is too wide now, and I\u2019d
    I\u2019d go back to version 1. for the figure one.\r\nAgree on consistency as
    it has been pointed.\r\nAs for the \u2018y\u2019, I think the negative v-space
    is too much, so you might\r\nimprove your design by pulling up the all the control
    points in the joint.\r\nI also disagree that you need to make it darker but you
    need to bold a tad\r\nup the cedilla and probably the agonek. Assuming the \u2018dieresis\u2019
    as correct\r\nvertical position you have to line all the accetns to those dots
    but the ring.\r\nThe Euro sign is wrong, the right end of the bars does not have
    to be parallel.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work.\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"
