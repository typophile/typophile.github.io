  superior design, but I was wondering what you think the family tree for Helvetica
  would be... grand parents, parents, respectable offspring, and bastard relations
  (Arial..)... what type of personality would these family members have... temperament,
  etc.\r\n\r\nHave a fun and safe holiday season.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSal Randazzo\r\n"

  body: Segoe is the yuppie, corporate dastard, step-grandson of Helvetica. He looks
    good from a distance but has now been jaded and his intentions have been turned
    straight evil.

    Helvetica.

    sake I guess it should still be on such a 'family tree' list."
