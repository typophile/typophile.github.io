  seen at the link below:\r\nhttp://www.empirepalace.net/images/logo.gif\r\n\r\nAll
  the lowercase characters are very similar to Bickham Script, but the uppercase characters
  are throwing me off.\r\nThe uppercase \"E\" seems pretty standard and can be found
  in a few English fonts as well as others.\r\nBut that \"P\" has a pretty unique
  style to it, so surely someone has seen this before.\r\n\r\nIve been searching through
  all my font books with no luck, so im hoping the collective wisdom of the world
  wide web can be of some help. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe it is even a combo of different
  fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
