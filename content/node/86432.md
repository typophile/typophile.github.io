  some guesses to get it to narrow down, because the resolution isn't very good on
  the image.  Take a look and see what you think.   \r\n\r\nThe pic uploader isn't
  working for me so please follow this link:\r\nhttp://professionaljobsearch.com/job_search.pages/ext-tapitGuide.html\r\nThen
  go to Your Resumes, click Before and After, then Next (universal), it's the second
  one. \r\n\r\nThanks. "

  body: The bold text is indeed ITC Clearface, but at least some of it appears to
    be stretched horizontally (the caps and small caps parts). The lighter font is
    Times or Times New Roman.
