  body: Well, it&#39;s based on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helveticarounded/helvetica-rounded-bold/testdrive.html?s=SPACE&amp;p=48">Helvetica
    Rounded</a>.. It&#39;s pretty easy to get to that stencil look from there. And
    if there&#39;s just the logo I doubt that there even is a font.
