    and drive past Lux several times a week. As seen from the road, the bottom bar
    of the &#34;L&#34; closes up the top of the &#34;u,&#34; and the name reads as
    &#34;Lox.&#34; <BR> <BR>Great coffee, though, and the owners are really nice folks. '

  body: ' Hello Marcox. Well there is a story behind this. <BR>Back in 1998 I created
    this logo in a horizontal and vertical format for the a cafe called Lux in <BR>the
    hip part of Seattle called Belltown. There was a neon sign as well as vinyl window
    sign fabricated. This establishment was sold in 2000 to a couple who sold again
    a year later, but kept he logo and brought it back to Phoenix, Arizona when they
    sold the Seattle location. I reprinted the businesscards and this promo with the
    new address on it in december 2001. I have not ever been to Phoenix or seen the
    new location, so I find it interesting that someone in the typophile community
    drives by there all the time. thanks for the info. Ole  <BR> <BR> The owners Felicia
    and Daniel purchased a cafe usy streets in in the hip part of Seattle called Belltown
    a few years ago. The cafe already had the logo you see above in a horizontal format
    in Neon signage. The '

    Thanks a lot Ole! <BR>Do you guys know of any other fonts that has the similar
    kind of feel that this one has? <BR>Im thinking especially of a font Paul Postma
    did as their corporate font for Koweiden Postma assosiates. The font was called
    &#39;KP Din&#39;. I doubt it&#39;s ever released as a font to buy.  <BR> <BR>
