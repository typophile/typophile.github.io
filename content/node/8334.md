body: Hi All <BR> <BR>I was wondering who you would pick as your all time top ten
  Dutch type designers? <BR> <BR>I am looking to get some books about Dutch type,
  and I thought a top ten would give me some names to search abe books with... <BR>
  <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim

    van Dijck <BR>Jan van Krimpen <BR>Gerard Unger <BR>Fred Smeijers <BR>Chris Brand
    <BR>Evert Bloemsma <BR>Martin Majoor <BR>Peter Matthias Noodzij <BR> <BR>I have
    excluded non-Dutch designers working in the Netherlands &#40;Fleischmann, Kis,
    etc.&#41;. Remember that I am a book typographer, so my list tends toward more
    &#34;conservative&#34; design &#40;e.g., not LettError stuff, which is good, I
    just can&#39;t use it much for my work&#41;. <BR> <BR>The <i>Dutch Type</i> book
    is a good resource, as is <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/holland.html">Luc&#39;s
    page</a> on the Dutch font scene.'

  body: 'Great question. No matter what the universalists might say, to me ethnicity
    is a huge contextual factor. Which doesn&#39;t mean the question of who is Dutch
    [enough] is a simple one! For me Fleischman is more Dutch then RvL for example
    - although in the end I would include both. But not Kis - his whole point was
    to go back home after learning punchcutting in Holland. <BR> <BR>But I can&#39;t
    come up with ten. Not because there aren&#39;t enough good Dutch type designers&#42;,
    but because beyond the small top tier there are in fact too many to mention -
    which would make it unfair &#40;and a lot more work!&#41; to cut off at 10. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Although my particular way of seeing Design &#40;as opposed to Art posing
    as Design&#41; does in fact exclude many people others might put at the top of
    their list. <BR> <BR>Anyway, my top tier is something like this: <BR> <BR>Christoffel
    van Dijck <BR>Johann Michael Fleischman <BR>Evert Bloemsma <BR>Gerard Unger <BR>Wim
    Crouwel <BR>LettError <BR>Petr van Blokland <BR>Luc[as] de Groot <BR>Thomas Milo
    <BR>Bram de Does <BR> <BR>Well will you look at that - in the end I got exactly
    10 after all!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure Tom Milo would not consider himself a type designer. If
    you want to acknowledge the design quality of his Arabic fonts, then you need
    to mention his wife, Miriam, who is indeed a very talented type designer.

  body: I got <i>Dutch Type</i> for Christmas. It&#39;s the best type book I&#39;ve
    seen in a long time. I highly recommend it. I won&#39;t get to start reading it
    until I finish Kinross&#39; new edition of <i>Modern Typography</i>, which I also
    got. As well as some strange new machine from Holland that blows bubbles in my
    coffee.

  body: Tom might not, but I do.  :-&#41; <BR>It&#39;s a matter of definitions I guess,
    sort of like deciding who&#39;s Dutch enough. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I did
    manage to forget the important role of <BR>his wife, so my entry should read Tom
    &amp; Miriam Milo instead. <BR> <BR>hhp
