body: "I'm currently designing an industrial design portfolio, and planning on using
  either Gotham Bold, Black, or Ultra for titles in all caps, and most likely Mercury
  for larger paragraphs (though I have also considered Miller). What I am looking
  for is a sans serif font that I can use for short sentences that go under photos
  in my portfolio. I don't want to use gotham because it looks too spaced out for
  a body text. Is there a second sans serif that I can use that plays well with both
  gotham and mercury? I'm looking for something that looks clean and modern, and that
  is easy to read on a mainly white background. What would you suggest?\r\n\r\n"

    Mercury for longer texts."

  body: "I like the look of Whitney in smaller sizes a lot, but I don't like Whitney's
    angles so I don't want to use it for headings. I want to use Gotham Ultra in all
    caps for the headings because I want something that is modern, simple, geometric,
    and somewhat architectural. Because it's for an Industrial design portfolio, where
    the headings are all that are going to be read during the first look through,
    the headings typeface is very important to me. Having said that, I don't like
    the look of Gotham for body font, so my hope was to use only capitals for titles,
    and then another font for the short captions. I am aware that this is not common
    practice, but was wondering if there was a way to make it work?\r\n\r\nI'm looking
    at Benton Sans as a way of meeting in the middle, and using it for headings and
    body text, but although I like it for body text, I wish it was more geometric
    and came in as thick of variations as Gotham does.\r\n\r\nIs there a font similar
    to Gotham that also reads well as body text?"

  body: Thanks for the ideas. Verlag was an option I looked at originally, as was
    FF DIN. Wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I did recently see Alright Sans,
    and I think I may go with that. It's almost everything I like about Gotham and
    Whitney combined

    self-pub book will have this as the primary cover graphic...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?rkxxrc9599dle6n\r\n\r\nI
    was keen on using Gotham Bold or Ultra for the cover and chapter headings, and
    Gotham Book for long text passages, and Gotham Light Italics for short vignettes
    of a few sentences to a few paragraphs that break up the text.\r\n\r\nBut the
    comments about Gotham's unsuitability for text give me pause.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess
    the go-to solution is Mercury or Miller... But if I am doing that I might as well
    go for (much cheaper) Proxima Nova instead of Gotham...\r\n\r\nAppreciate any
    suggestions for achieving a hip look. \r\n\r\nGunnar"
