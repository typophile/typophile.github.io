body: "I am creating a poster brochure aimed at teenagers but still appealing to adults
  - parents and teachers. I want a body font stylish, modern, with an edge. I've used
  Univers for one of the headings and the company's logo is in prosper-book. \r\nI
  want something nice and readible and breezy. I was looking at Optima but it's a
  bit too old fashioned and I was looking at using univers for the body but I'm sure
  if its as readible and I'm not sure which weight to use. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  appreciated, thanks!\r\n\r\nAndy"

  body: "I'd go with a 'poster' typeface. Think Champion [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100002|Champion]]
    , [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]
    or maybe [[http://typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=NjI1|Heroic]]. I'm not sure
    if that's what you had in mind, but hopefully it'll help.\r\n\r\nMaybe if I knew
    a bit more about the brochure I could suggest some more."

    is a new face which may fit the bill.
