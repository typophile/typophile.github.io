  body: "Yes, I believe that too, after hunting the font books and scrolling the 'slabserif'
    collection at MyFonts.\r\n\r\nThe absolutely monotone strokes, and the Aachen-like
    S, with an oblong O have been hard to find in one font, but if you are not above
    using two fonts, you could probably make this with your idea of Egyptienne Condensed
    and a font called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/vinchenso/\">Vinchenso</a>,
    by Bob Alonso.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "The <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php\">Serif ID
    Guide</a> includes slab serifs, but the problem is that this sample uses none
    of the 12 Key letters, although I could guess the E and M, and one or two other
    caps. \r\n\r\nThat's how I got the Amasis idea.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
