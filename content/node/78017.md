  body: I'd take anything close, as well. I know I have something like this in my
    collection, I'm just having a devil of a time finding it.

  body: Johnny Depp and Rango look like custom lettering. "From the director of ..."
    looks like a font, and it could be a custom font made to match the lettering,
    although it doesn't quite match with those spurs. It's got a Tim Burton look,
    but maybe that's just because it's a poster for a movie with Johnny Depp. The
    "Nightmare Before Christmas" & "Alice In Wonderland" fan fonts on the free sites
    are slightly similar.
