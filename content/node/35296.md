  a black screen saves more energy, and if google were to have their main page as
  white on black, it would save '750 mega watts/hour per year'.\r\n\r\nsee here: http://www.blackle.com/
  \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone knows of any research regarding it being easier
  to read text on screen in white-on-black rather than black-on-white?\r\n\r\nTa\r\n\r\nGraham"

    plasma panels. LCD monitors are illuminated behind their entire  matrix of what
    are essentially tiny shutters. In that case a black screen would use more energy,
    as power is required for each pixel to darken.\r\n\r\nText on paper is generally
    much harder to read reversed out (white on black) even when special measures are
    taken to make it less difficult. On-screen, the letters are backlit, so some problems
    such as ink gain are not an issue."

    green or amber type on black.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure at which point we decided to
    reverse the whole thing and go with mainly black text on white...it was likely
    around the 1984, I'm guessing ;o)\r\n\r\nI think the argument is that a medium-intensity
    color like amber or green on black is a nice contrast without causing eye strain.\r\n\r\nIf
    you do reverse out your text, do not use 100% intensity colors on black. White
    on black on screen can be very hard on the eyes. Consider something like 70% grey
    on black.\r\n"

    makes reading very difficult due to the low contrast, especially on low point
    sizes.\r\n\r\nGraham, I researched into this a while back, and on screen, white
    on black is easier to read. This is largely due to the illumination of white on
    screen that causes eye strain. Sometimes, though, it may seem harder to read white
    on black because we're all generally used to reading black on white in print."

    Having said nthat surely the Parc guys are to blame? "

    Yea, 70% grey on black would be a nightmare to read. ;o)\r\n\r\nThe problem with
    white on black is that the contrast is just to high. You need to tone down the
    white just a tad to make it comfortable for most folks."
