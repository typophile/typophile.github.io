  before but they are used in a logotype. <BR> <BR>So there is the possibility that
  they are custom. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your help! <BR>Adam <BR> <BR><img

  body: I also thought it had that Bodega Sans flava, mixed with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/plaza-2/">Plaza</a>-style
    embellishments. <BR> <BR>But at this moment I have no idea what the real font
    is, if it is indeed a font.

  body: I agree with Yves. Maybe <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FB00001702P2"
    target="_blank">this showing at Phils Fonts</a> isolates the Oldstyle better?  I
    think the add-on swash is just that, and it looks too light for the font strokes
    &#40;IMO&#41;. A little outline tweaking would account for most other variations
    from the original font, I think.

  body: Thank you all very much! It was customized, whether it was done well or not,
    is another discussion. <BR> <BR>Have a great week. <BR>
