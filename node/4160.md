  body: Hi Alexis, <BR> <BR>This looks like Bickham Script to me, you can buy it from
    Adobe.

  body: Be sure to get the Bickham swash caps or you won&#39;t be able to to do the
    embellished caps &#40;the uppercase F, for example&#41;.

  body: These days Adobe sells only the OpenType version. You&#39;ll need an OpenType
    savvy application &#40;such as Illustrator CS or InDesign&#41; to take full advantage
    of the extra goodies. However, if you have one of those, the extra stuff is all
    built in. <BR> <BR>That being said, there is an even more cool version of Bickham
    Script in the works, but we have not given a release date for Bickham Script Pro.
    <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Yes, you can still get the MM version from some folks who resell Adobe&#39;s
    fonts, such as MyFonts.com. Given a reasonable alternative, I would not recommend
    buying an MM font at this time, however. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
