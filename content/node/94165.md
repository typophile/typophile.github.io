  in image but in vain.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please identify the fonts in the image.
  It looks similar to ABBEYLINE but the fonts have slight difference in width for
  some characters.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time and help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12251_4985.gif]"

  body: "The proper place for such requests is the Type ID Board. That being said,
    whatever typeface was used here, it has been sorely abused. If your sample is
    from a PDF file, an unfortunate swap may have occurred, because the wordspacing
    is inconsistent, and the letterspacing\u2014in one egregious instance\u2014is
    totally inappropriate.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, if it is in fact from a PDF file,
    you can check the Document Properties under Fonts and see what's happening, which
    most likely is not what the original author intended.\r\n\r\n"
