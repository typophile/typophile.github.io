  picture is from an 80's renault 5 gordini'turbo'\r\n\r\n Unfortunately these cars
  are like hens teeth nowadays. Getting hold of original decals is impossible , orginal
  ones are long faded and no longer 'sticky' . It's basically down to pot luck on
  a foreign eBay website and even then it's going to be hit and miss as most are replicas
  that dont actually look anything like the original.\r\n\r\nI am looking to get some
  made up for my car but am struggling with the font here. I would very much appreciate
  some critical eyes to go over it and see what you think.\r\n\r\nThe closest i can
  find is Palatino Linotype. The angle on the flick backs on th e'u' , 'r' &'b' are
  not horizontal though\r\n\r\nTVVMIA\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/help-wot-font_5090.JPG]"

    face called <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/renault/&sample_text=Turbo&sample_size=96\">Renault</a>
    is for sale, and your word \"Turbo\" is as close as you can get (it doesn't match
    perfectly though). Just add the stripes.\r\n\r\n> <em>Unfortunately these cars

  body: Just go for the bold weight from Scangraphic at $17.50. Just make sure to
    select the correct optical size -- <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/scangraphic/renault_sb_bold/">Renault
    SB Bold</a> is for body sizes and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/scangraphic/renault_sh_bold/">Renault
    SH Bold</a> is for headline sizes.
