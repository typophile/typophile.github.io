  thought of Zapfino. I sometimes get the feeling it's can be hard to read. the point
  size is set at 23, what leading should it be subsequently?\r\n\r\nany other suggestions
  of typeface are very welcome."

  body: "Even though Zapfino contains many flourish lines, it certainly is not quite
    suitable for long texts as it distracts the reader from the content. In my 'own'
    opinion, try Poetica Chancery with variations or Snell Roundhand, Edwardian Script
    or even Shelley families as these are more readable. But it's solely up to your
    intentions and ideas.\r\n\r\n--- pinky kinky winky ---"
