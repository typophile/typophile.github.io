  It is called: Antic. I'm still working on the italics because I want to make them
  \u201Ctrue italics\u201D, not just slanted.Hope you like it how it goes so far,
  and comment is welcome. Below there's a link to the pdf.\r\n\r\ncheers!\r\n\r\n*link

  body: "Show black & white pairs, alphabets and pangrams of the same size instead
    of posters.\r\n\r\nSome of your letters (e, c, o) are slanted, while others (n,
    t, f, v, x...) are not.\r\n/e/ bar falls out of style by being so thin. On the
    other side, curves are thicker than other stems.\r\nCompare /n/ and /r/ connections
    - they are not the same.\r\nHairline /a/ looks fine, but heavier weight's tops
    are too heavy.\r\nEither /M, O, C, Y/ are too wide, or other capitals are too
    narrow. Inconsistency.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m_6735.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/synt_5770.JPG]\r\n\r\nCan't

  body: "Looks very promising, like it a lot!\r\n\r\nFirst things that I noticed is
    the somehwat small crossbar on the /e/ (in the \"synth mixtape & coffee\" line
    it really stands out). The /a/ on that same line also looks a bit off. Looks like
    you are trying to create contrastb there but it's not working exactly right (not
    sure how to fix it though, im not a pro myself)\r\n\r\nas noted above, the /y/
    seems a bit out of form since it's leaning a bit & has odd angles?\r\n\r\nI like
    the /a/ and /c/ a lot. love how that c drops at the top\r\n\r\nI see that the
    /M O C/ are wide as Minerva noted, but not sure if you should fix them. They need
    some companions maybe? You could decide to widen the /P/ and /R/ and similar others
    as well? Just an idea though, not sure how that will turn out!"

  body: "It'd be a good idea to set some paragraphs (black on white) at text sizes
    and perhaps the glyph set at a large size so we can zoom on all the details and
    see how it performs in running copy.\r\n\r\nTake all advice with plenty of salt...\r\n\r\nSince
    this has a humanist architecture, consider the speed of writing...I really like
    the dynamism/forward motion of the e, and I think I'd try to match that in some
    other letters. The t for example is more restrained in its foot, which turns up
    more. Look also at how swoopy your ampersand (or the g) is compared to the f,
    which is much firmer. The base of the t is malformed in the middling light weights.\r\n\r\nYour
    a sticks out a bit much for me: remember the game is to get even rhythm and counterspaces
    among all the letters. Especially in the boldest weight, it's hard to see whether
    the problem is the small counter of the a or the much larger counter of the o.
    I think o generally needs a little contrast, and probably some narrowing. (Also
    the c) \r\n\r\nI think the n and r have different joins by necessity. I'd probably
    tweak the m however. There's something funny going on at the x-height in the m,
    n and r for me: the arch looks lower than the spurs, or the spurs look too long,
    I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nCrossbars of I could be more definite, if you're going to
    go with this style.\r\n\r\nIt's normal for curves to be heavier than stems, at
    their thickest point, to compensate for the parts where they are thinner. I can't
    see any spots where you've made them too thick, other than perhaps the top of
    the e.\r\n\r\nSpacing looks tight in the boldest weight."

    I've corrected now, and the joints on \u2018n\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019 are different
    \ by necessity, as @Bendy point it out\r\n\r\n@stinger: I also first noticed the
    \u2018e\u2019 crossbar too, but I wasn't sure, that's the kind of things that
    need to be said by someone else\r\n\r\n@Bendy: I wasn't aware of the stiffness
    on \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019, and yes the \u2018t\u2019 on light weight
    is wrong, I'll try to low a little bit spurs on \u2018m\u2019 \u2018n\u2019 and

  body: "Are the alphabets updated version?\r\nAnd instead of pictures and body text,
    give alphabet (and some pangrams) .pdf's. Can't zoom in now.\r\n\r\n/e/ crossbar
    still falls out. Try making it like /a/ pointed variant.\r\nWhile you want flowing
    feel with some slanted letters, /a/ is pointing in the opposite direction.\r\nWhen
    you change (thicken) /e/ bar, /g/ ear has to be changed too.\r\n/b/ is narrower
    than /d/, /p/ is WAY narrower than /q/.\r\n/y/ is still too slanted. It has to
    be made from /v/.\r\n/z/ diagonal needs to be thinner.\r\n/x/ is slanted (not
    sure if intended).\r\nAdd a bar to /G/ terminal.\r\n/S/ too wide.\r\n/Z/ and /z/
    are slanted to the left. \r\nMake /1/ flag shorter and more angular.\r\n/2/ diagonal
    is too thick.\r\n/6/ and /9/ are way too slanted.\r\nPlus, there's lots of optical
    correction to be done."
