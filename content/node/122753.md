  design. Open Sans is probably the most used Google font. So what do you guys think?
  Lack of originality? Very easy to copy, as you can see in the attached image.\r\n"

  body: "No specific problem with the font choice - it's readable, clean and modern
    as reflects their (self-)image. Given their financial problems, I'm not entirely
    startled to see them using a freebie font - at least they picked a well-designed
    one. I'm not too keen on those apostrophes, though, and the spacing around the
    top 'r's' looks very off.  Not awful, but the whole thing is lacking in flair.\r\n\r\nAnd
    using a generic font is a mistake, as you say, for any organisation that expects
    to be mocked and parodied. Anything that helps pranksters create fake Labour posters
    easily is a big mistake. \r\n\r\nThe Tories (Britain's Conservative party) found
    this out the hard way last election - within days of their poster launch there
    was a [[http://mydavidcameron.com|website that let people make parody posters]]."

  body: Even though I am not from Britain (but from its neighbour to the east), I
    think the political party visual identities are rather nice over there. The trend
    of flat design has certainly hit the party headquarters in Britain. Labour use
    Neo Sans as their main font.  The Tories apparently use Futura as their new font
    (a departure from Lucida Sans and Franklin Gothic).  UKIP use Interstate and The
    LibDems use Helvetica. Don't care about SNP... Separatists.

    will-it-go-boom-if-I-nudge-it-three-degrees-off-plumb applied to the Open Sans
    uprights?
