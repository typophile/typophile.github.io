    a few people get hired to do type design each year. Regarding freelance, I\u2019ll
    tell you what everybody told me: either design at least a dozen great fonts of
    your own or go to grad school and then maybe people will think about giving you
    some work. This is not an easy field to break into!"

    You can use ellipses a lot, if it is consistent with your style. But if you use
    them everywhere, it looks like you don't know how to punctuate. ...IMHO

    demand for font production workers.\r\nSo to make a living at type design you
    will have to become an entrepreneur.\r\nI suggest you leave the USA (see <a href=\"http://www.coldtype.net/Assets.10/Pdfs/0510.Reader46.pdf\">this</a>
    article, page 17), for a place where people of colour suffer less discrimination,
    where there is universal healthcare, &c., &c, and live away from a big city, where
    there is a low overhead and a decent standard of living--as long as high speed
    internet is available! Then you will be able to make a living from selling fonts
    on MyFonts, as you build up your catalogue of type designs.\r\nAs for racial discrimination,
    you may find it looking for a job, but not when someone is licensing a font, because
    who designed it is not generally part of the business decision, so again, be an
    entrepreneur, don't look for a job.\r\nWhere would you like to live? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is that there's a lack of minorities in the entire field of graphic design. This
    could work to your advantage, especially in corporate jobs. On several occasions
    over the years I've had people at corporations ask me if I could suggest minority
    candidates for design jobs, because they weren't getting minority applicants.\r\n\r\nAs
    others have said, you may find it difficult finding a job doing just type design,
    so you might end up having a day job in a design department and then do type design
    evenings and weekends until you build up enough business that you can do it freelance
    full time."

    Shinn - I never expected anyone to give me a job...I was asking a curious question
    to the \"public-at-large\"... I've worked very hard to get and keep my jobs and
    clients... so I guess have that \"entrepreneur\" thing down. As for your suggestion
    to leave the country... I'm not going anywhere...although I hear Canada is nice,
    Atlanta is fine for me...I guess I will just have to work harder and about facing
    racial discrimination...you can still be turned down when licensing a font especially
    when you make face to face presentations of your work to those who make the business
    decisions at creative studios, agencies, newspapers and the like...but that will
    not stop me...\r\n\r\n@terminaldesign - I'm at 5 typefaces so far...2 set to release

    Sudweeks - About the handle...if you know what it means to me I might consider
    changing it...\r\n\r\n@James M - That is a bigger issue (Cultural diversity in
    Graphic Design) that has been discussed and somehow fades away every time it is
    brought up... [[http://kissmyblackads.blogspot.com/| click here]] to find out
    more...But the part time designer/ part time type designer is where I am right

    I think it's because they understand that not following the conventions puts a

    but to many readers it is off-putting, and signals being wet behind the ears,
