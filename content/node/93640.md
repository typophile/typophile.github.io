  image. I have been struggling to identify this font on various forums and sites
  but without any success. \r\n\r\nThe nearest one I found was \"Screwtop Regular\"
  but that consists of dots whereas I need a font without dots. \r\n\r\nPlease help.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance \r\n\r\nMark"

    in which case the typeface is probably proprietary to the machine.\r\n\r\nIf you
    want solid\u2014rather than dotted\u2014letters that look as ratty as your original,
    you could set your copy in Photoshop, rasterize it, apply a Gaussian blur, then
    adjust the levels to pure black and white."
