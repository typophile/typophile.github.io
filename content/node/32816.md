  working on an experimental wood typeface design / production project. The project
  was recently selected to be featured in a <a href=http://www.mcla.edu/Gallery51/0703/
  target=_blank>Contemporary Letterpress</a> exhibition, so I figured it would be
  a good time to put all my process together for others to see.\r\nYou can read more

    and your presentation of it. When will you start selling prints?

  body: "I have found your site before. It was intriguing to me that there are someone
    who actually like letters carved in wood; is interested on them beyond their forms,
    not digital, where they are more then a idea. They ARE, not only as letter forms
    : They are tangible. Exist, and occupy their own physical space.\r\n\r\nPraise!"

    I can see it used for upmarket posters/signage in a store like FRESH & WILD, a
    campanion to the chalk board lettering.\r\nbest of luck with it."
