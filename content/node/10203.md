    <BR> <BR>Damn. If I could just get the wonderful line weight right out of the

    target="_blank">ITC&#39;s version</a> has the correct r. So does Linotype&#39;s,
    but Bitstream has a hook on the r. <BR> <BR>It still looks customized.

  body: I have a friend at the Times special mags, I can ask him if it&#39;s a commercially
    available font. But since the Times tends to get original/proprietary fonts drawn,
    like their lovely light Cheltenham, it may not be for sale to us peons.

  body: Dear Patricia, <BR> <BR>That would be great. <BR> <BR>As the above research
    &#40;and mine - I&#39;ve got both Memphis, Lubalin &amp; Calvert open right now&#41;
    demonstrates we can get close but not perfect.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a beautiful
    redraw.

  body: The Times has been using Stymie.  It must be an Ultra Light version, as I
    only have up to a Light weight, but it seems like the same characters. Bitstream&#39;s
    version appears to be the closest - the lower-case &#39;r&#39; seems to vary with
    different foundries, with the previously mentioned hook. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/stymie/light/testdrive.html?s=High-rise&amp;p=72"

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been besotted with those self-same slab serif fonts since last
    Fall&#39;s special issue of the Times&#39; T magazine, and I called and asked
    the art directors ..er... directly, and they were very helpful.  The irony is
    that I&#39;ve had the font in my company&#39;s library all this time...

  body: Stymie was my first guess too but no version/weight I could find had that
    distinctive vertical dot on the i.

  body: So George, how many beers do I have to buy for the NYTimes staff to get a
    license for the font? <BR> <BR>Patricia, if he can&#39;t answer that one, what
    say your friend? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Everyone, thanks for the invaluable help.
    Stymie was off the radar and I was about to redraw Lubalin Graph, and then I came
    across Lubalin Graph XLit it has the closest line weight but with a higher x-height
    than the specimen <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/lubalin-graph/xlit/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/lubalin-graph/xlit/</a>.
    <BR> <BR>I am all the more knowlegeable but still coveting the face. Besotted,
    indeed.

    it is a Times custom font. <BR> <BR>Not the answer you wanted I know.

  body: Ah Kyle - I wish I knew that answer - I&#39;ve had quite a few font infatuations
    meself! I usually wait until I find another obsession and move on - unsatisfied
    but renewed!  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Lubalin Graph XLit approximates the weight, but
    I do prefer Stymie&#39;s lowercase &#34;a&#34; - it just makes it more approachable,
    I think. This reminds me of how I was obsessed with Teleneue and then saw the
    XLit version in &#42;surface magazine, which brought the need to a whole new level...!

  body: There was an ITC face called L&amp;C Stymie Lightline which was similar to
    this, but there are differences such as the dot on the i. Also, it has not been
    digitized &#40;AFAIK&#41;.

  body: Image Club had ITC Stymie Hairline in the last couple of its Letterpress CD&#39;s
    &#40;5.0 and 6.0, which I have&#41;. Does that sound like the same thing Mark?
    I can make a sample from it, if you&#39;d like to see it.

  body: Yes, I think it would be the same thing. It was part of the initial set of
    typefaces ITC released, all display faces, some picked up from VGC designs done
    by the ITC people before ITC was formed in 1970. The L&amp;C &#40;which stands
    for Lubalin and Carnase&#41; may have been dropped at some point.

    to enjoy the Times Magazine each Saturday. What a treat... <BR> <BR>George- Your
    trailing love for type sounds familiar. I think that it one of the reasons why
    we continue to appreciate, use and make these things. <BR> <BR>Mike- Yes, Please
    make a sample. If it scratches the itch I will press ITC for more info. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    y&#39;all.

  body: Stymie&#39;s definitely experiencing a resurgence in popularity &#40;assuming
    it was ever popular, considering it&#39;s not that new a font&#41;. I&#39;ve seen
    posters as well as logos using the font in the West Village, and I just became
    aware of it because of the New York Times&#39; T magazine usage.

  body: Kyle, <BR>Sorry for the delay, but I&#39;ve been gone all day. Image Club
    fonts are now sold by Monotype Imaging &#40;Fonts.com&#41;, but Stymie Hairline
    is no longer in their collection. As I understand it you can still get some of
    the old Letterpress 6.0 CD&#39;s &#40;Typophile Grant Hutchinson recently had
    some, if you want to get in touch with him.&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/serifa/thin/testdrive.html?s=High-rise&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Serifa</a>, by Adrian Frutiger, has  Thin weight, which is about
    as close in something commercial that I know. You could also write to me &#40;off
    thread&#41; for other ideas.
