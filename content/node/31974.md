body: I'm typesetting a poem that has some pretty wacky spacing, and it needs to be
  right-justified with wide spaces between the words and margins. But when I try to
  insert spaces at the end of the right-justified lines, they don't actually appear.
  Is there a way that I can get the spaces to work the way I want, or do I should
  I just stick some sort of invisible character at the end of the line, after the
  spaces?

  body: I was confused at first by what you said, but I think I now understand what
    you mean. You want to add spaces at the right side of each right-justified line,
    but InDesign thinks that by choosing right justify, you want all the lines to
    line up uniformly; thus, adding spaces with no characters following them does
    nothing. There seem to be two options. 1) You can add the spaces you want to the
    right of a line and then type any character; you'll see the spaces suddenly appear.
    Then, just make that character's color transparent (highlight it, then in the
    toolbox, choose the red slash for the fill color). Now looking at your original
    question, this is your "invisible character" method. 2) Use right justified tabs
    to align each line independently. Trying it out myself, the tab method seems overly
    awkward and confusing for right justification, so I might go with the invisible
    character method. Hope those solutions help.

    to line up on the right, y'know....  :-)  \r\n\r\nIf you want nothing to line
    up, which is what it sounds like you want, then Marc's is the most effective solution.
    \ Or you should left-justify and tinker with the indent -- gets you the same place
    by the reverse means."
