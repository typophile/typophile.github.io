  body: I couldn't tell you, but it'll be well worth waiting for if it's even half
    as good as the Mac version. Honestly it's the only font management app I've ever
    got along with. It makes font management a joy which is exactly opposite to the
    experience of Suitcase Confusion or any of the others including FontAgent.
