  these strange capitulars.  She is writing his thesis about Sebasti\xE3o Nunes, a
  Brazilian Poet of the 90\u2019s that used those capitulars on his book Hist\xF3ria
  do Brasil a satiric view of the Brazilian historiography. The colophon doesn\u2019t
  inform nothing about the typeface and the author too.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nTo me,
  the typeface looks like a kind of clipart from an old book capitular. Take a look
  in the irregular contours, the oldstyle proportions and the \u201Cancient-greek-roman\u201D
  ornamentation. To me is  something from XVI century.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cassia_6664.gif]"
