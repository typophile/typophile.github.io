  must either be a silly joke or designer masturbation at its finest.\r\n\r\nCan someone
  explain to me how Johnathan Ellery's book <a href=\"http://www.brownsdesign.com/work/?id=23&subcat=&cat=41&i=118\">\"87\"</a>
  is not simply a gallery of numerals designed by other artists (type designers)?
  I find the <a href=\"http://www.brownsdesign.com/work/?id=23&subcat=&cat=41&i=110\">copyright
  page</a> particularly amusing, given that it seems none of the content is original.
  Please tell me I'm missing something."

    the meanings of \"87\" and perhaps it's metaphysical ramifications on our lives.
    \r\n\r\nI don't think your missing anything Stephen...this book appears to be
    exactly what you said. A gallery of numbers from different typefaces.\r\n\r\nLook
    for the exciting sequel to Johnathan Ellery's \"87\" entitled \"69\" due out this
    summer. "

  body: "I haven't seen the book. I did visit the link.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is some
    meaning in the choice and sequencing of type? (If the choice of type used for
    a book communicates something, cannot multiple such choices say something?) Perhaps
    this ties in with the arrangement and choice of numbers?\r\n\r\nIn crude terms,
    there is about 10-20 bits of information content per font choice and a similar
    amount for the layout and choice of numbers. Not a huge amount of explicit information
    content for a book, but perhaps it's simply well-compressed with a wealth of implicit
    information lying in wait for those who choose to seek it out."
