  in 2008. I would love to read your feedback, as I'm hoping on some really good insights
  as I share the redesign process here.\r\n\r\nSo, here's the sketch:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Illiad_5598.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst
  two cents, anyone?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance. Cheers!"

  body: 'I agree with Hrant: those gaps are too effective fixation points for comfortable
    reading. Your other design features are more than enough to make your font stand
    out. Loose the gaps, and you have a very good headline font.'

  body: The light italic looks very cool! The w is looking very narrow and thick in
    the bottom. It appears to look a little different in "ottawa". The a leans a little
    left for me, which is not a problem in the middle of a word, but at the beginning
    feels odd. I agree with whats being said about the gaps.

  body: "james: I also love the italic, thanks!\r\n\r\nThe \"w\" incoherence is something
    I'm struggling right now. The light version is very curvy, while the black is
    very orthogonal, and the resulting weights are interpolations of these two.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the \"a\", your right. The top bar is too wide.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
