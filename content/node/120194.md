  body: "Good find Mike. All I can find out about this font is that it was by Bernard
    Jaquet, presumably a French or Swiss designer, and it was first used by the French
    \ dry-transfer lettering company, Mecanorma in 1971. [Source Identifont http://www.identifont.com/show?1CG
    and http://www.identifont.com/show?273K ]\r\nDo we know anything more?\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks much for that, Stephen.\r\n\r\nIt's incredible that the same designer
    created Spring - digitized by Canada Type as <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jojo/'
    target='_blank'>Jojo</a>. Maybe he had two personalities ...\r\n\r\n It appears
    that Identifont and MyFonts (for Jackson) have Jacquet's name misspelled."

    fit the Austin Powers movies as \"groovy\" -- I prefer the  unique formalism of
    the other design.\r\nDon"

  body: <a href="http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44643.html">Luc Devroye</a> seems certain
    they are two different Jacquets, but <a href="http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Jacquet/BJacquet.pdf">Hans
    Reichardt</a> (Klingspor) feels they are one and the same.

  body: BTW, my Typophlile track link doesn't seem to include posts for the new(ish)
    Font ID forum. Is that true? Or am I missing a secret feature?

    :(\r\nI followed the links in your earlier post and confirmed my impression that
    the digitization of Jackson MN is of poor quality compared to the original.\r\nHere
    are a few letters from the pre-digital era[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EgittoRipotecaItalianaExcerpt_4021.jpg]\r\nThe
    best quality image was from the Ripoteca Italiana version, so I used it for this
    excerpt. The Mecanorma dry transfer sheet looks the same.\r\nHere are a few letters
    from the digital Jackson MN\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JacksonMN_FO__6098.jpg]\r\nNot
    only are the outlines sloppy, but height of the letters varies  noticiably.\r\nDon"
