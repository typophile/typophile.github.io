  to find a match for this font but haven't succeeded so far. It does look so much
  like Poster Bodoni (or some kind of a heavy Bodoni) yet again it is a lot more \"compressed\"...
  Anyone who can please help with the right id?... (Or would this by chance be another
  case of a type having been \"squooshed\" as Yves Peters hinted about in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19652\">that
  previous thread I asked about Times New Roman</a>?...)\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated for
  any further help. :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trexo_3532.jpg]"

  body: This one is not squooshed, so we're indeed looking for a condensed, very fat
    Bodoni-like modern serif. The hunt is on...

    been \"subject to squooshing\" and when not?... (And once more pardon for all
    of my ignorance... :-P)\r\n\r\nAnd still thank you again for all and any additional
    help in this \"hunting\", thank you indeed! :-)\r\n\r\nP.S.: If it is of further
    help in any manner, the sample is from 1997.\r\n"

    tell.
