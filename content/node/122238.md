  about the redesign of Vogue's typography, but I can't see that this is one of those
  typafes:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The foundation of Paris Vogue\u2019s redesign is a new
  typographic system. Using Gerard Unger\u2019s Paradox for body copy and the 18th-century
  Fleischmann for stand-firsts, M/M adopted a rough-edged schoolbook typeface for
  headlines (a face they named Gulliver after the subject of the book) and employ
  one of their own existing designs (now called Carine) to title fashion spreads.

    after Carine Roitfeld of French Vogue, that looks nothing like your sample:\r\nhttp://www.buero-newyork.com/work/carine-typeface-1#asset-0\r\n\r\nI
    guess since both are bespoke and not commercially available, being named the same
    isn\u2019t such a big deal...."
