  making a customized newspaper of Russian origin for a motion graphics shot.  I am
  using a lot of scanned material from Russian print papers I bought in Brighton Beach
  to construct the paper, but need this font to customize the content of the headlines.
  \ I'm hoping to find the correct cyrillic font from this scanned image.  Is this
  recognizable to anyone?  Thanks for the help.  JK"
