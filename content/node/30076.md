  body: "Also available as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=M.125834.0.0\">ITC
    Bookman</a> from FontShop. Sadly, our sampler doesn't show the swash alternates
    quite yet, but I assure you they are there. You can get a sample by calling up
    the boys at FS.\r\n\r\nI can't speak to the differences between Jukebox's (Veer)
    version and the Monotype version, except to assume that Jukebox used scanned samples
    for their interpretation and Monotype probably used the original foundry art as
    they own ITC."
