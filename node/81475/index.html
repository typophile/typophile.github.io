  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi.  My name is Drew and I am doing a branding and development project for a local Mortgage company.  The company name is First Home Equity Loans.  He asked for a new logo to be &ldquo;upstanding, professional, and to look bigger than the company really is&rdquo;.  He is a former Marine and carries himself and his business in a very upstanding and patriotic demeanor.  I developed two different ideas for the logo and he chose from the two.  I would like some feedback on both of them as the one he chose will need to be more fully developed and the one he did not choose I would like to possibly use in the future.  The customer was happy with the file called &ldquo;fhe logo approved.pdf&rdquo; and I would like to finalize that one.  The other file &ldquo;fhe house tab sample.pdf&rdquo; is the file I would like to possibly re-use in the future.  Again I would appreciate any feedback or critique.  I will try to be responsive with any requests. Please keep in mind this is one of my first projects and I would like to make this a portfolio piece.  Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way I would like some feedback on the perception of the geometric icon in the approved logo.  Is it recognizable? does it read as houses connected or not?</p>

<p>sample - seems really busy. i&rsquo;d suggest you start in black white first then move to color.</p>

You have the opportunity to emphasize certain words to guide the eye toward more important parts first.  Then consider a left alignment, the center align is not doing any favors to your composition.

		<div class="commentbody">Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that &ldquo;home equity loans&rdquo; is one idea or term.  If so, it would make the most sense to have FIRST be larger on the top line, and the rest smaller on the bottom line.  The way you are breaking the text now, it reads as FIRST HOME, which might be only for people buying their first home or something - and EQUITY LOANS which I am not sure is the proper term in the business.  Hope that helps.</div>
