  body: "So do you think it's stretched or something? Cause the proportions aren't
    the same (see \"P\").\r\nOr is the sample pre-digital, so that nothing we find

    the tracking.\r\n\r\nAnother candidate is the old FontBank [[http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/hefty.htm|\"Hefty\"]]\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Mike, agreed. One possible problem with Archive Antique Extended though \r\nis
    that it looks like a \"dirty\" digitization; for instance, head serifs of \"U\"
    and \"L\" \r\ndon't line up.\r\n\r\nHefty is fun too. Ah, I enjoy this genre :)"

  body: Nina, you're right. The reason its slightly different is probably because
    there were many metal and wood types in the genre and only some have been digitized.
