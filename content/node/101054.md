  I read the rules before posting but could not find any regulations regarding requesting
  help from fellow users. If I have broken any rules - please do not hesitate to lock
  or delete this topic.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of starting up a small charity
  (donation predictions: below $9K a year, unincorporated). The charity will be geographical
  concentrated to the poorest parts of Africa in terms of GDP. As of today, the charity
  does not have any capital to speak of, and I can therefore not acquire professional
  design services from a bureau. My skills in InDesign and Illustrator are limited,
  and I could really need some help to create a Color Profile and a logotype (type/font)
  for the charity; or at the very least some professional advice about these matters.\r\n\r\n<strong>Regarding
  Color Profile:</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat type of colors should the charity use?\r\nGeneral
  advice when it comes to colors?\r\nYour suggestions (color codes)?\r\n\r\n<strong>Regarding
  Logotype</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat font do you recommend?\r\nGeneral advice about logotypes?\r\nWould
  you be able to help the charity by providing a suggestions/ an InDesign template?\r\n\r\nI
  would happily provide you with more details about the charity, but I do not want
  to bore you with excessive information in the first post! Please feel free to reply
  to this thread. And if it not forbidden by the forum rules, I would happily give
  you my e-mail in a reply to this thread.\r\n\r\nThank you all! All advice/comments/suggestions
  are appreciated!"

    flags\u2014so, when in Rome\u2026\r\n\r\nSometimes, the name of the organization
    for which a logo is designed suggests a particular typographic treatment. Care
    to share?"

    to develop your logo, stationery, etc. Perhaps a design student at a local college.

  body: "Hi Vilgot, for inspiration of a logo design and branding color scheme I'd
    like to share with y'all my friends gallery:  hamillgallery dot com.\r\n\r\nTake
    your time and go through all of their most awesome African stuff. The masks, the
    weapons such as sheilds, the figures, the textiles, etc., etc.. Look at the patterns
    and look at the color schemes ...we're taking awesome traditional motifs that
    are very current and seem very modern / timeless.\r\n\r\nFor just one example,
    but mighty powerful at that, check out the Yoruba beaded crown from Nigeria!!\r\n\r\nAmazing
    color scheme(s) and there at least 3 or 4 strong logo inspirations you could glean
    from just that one example ...not to mention that bead work pattern alone. Beads
    strung together are a symbol of uniting.\r\n\r\nAs Nick asks ... what is the charity's
    name?\r\n\r\nn.  "
