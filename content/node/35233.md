  body: Italic headline in The Walrus is a Didot of some kind. Couldn't find a weight
    that matches in the Linotype version, although that's the one it most closely
    resembles.

  body: "I think the text font is a Garamond, and I'd guess <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/atf/garamond-no-3/\">Garamond
    No. 3</a>, based on the J , M and Q. I think there is an Adobe version of this.\r\n\r\n-
