  body: I am setting text for a 12 page fiction piece. Back ground is dark blue, text
    is white. I have been using Gills Sans Book and Book Italic and have done all
    I can to save space with spacing, etc.. <BR>Here is screenshot of current layout.
    to answer your question-can it be ugly, well I already think Gill Sans is kind
    of ugly so I suppose this question is relative.  <BR>I bought a condensed version
    of Clearview today, thinking it may work but in is even less space saving than
    Gills Sans. <BR>I have tried to reduce size from 8pt to 7.6 and this only helps
    a tiny bit.

  body: Wow. Is the objective to get rid of all but the most dedicated readers who
    desperately want to read this? Make it as hard to read as possible? <BR> <BR>This
    text suffers from two problems for ease of reading extended text. It&#39;s reversed,
    and the point size is small. Combining those two problems along with making it
    twelve pages will make it very challenging indeed. It&#39;s not that readers can&#39;t
    read it, but rather that they won&#39;t want to bother. <BR> <BR>Unless of course
    the pages are only maybe 3&#34; x 4&#34; or something, and the total word count
    is only a couple of hundred words. Then it will be challenging and weird, but
    not totally crazy. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    Myriad MM perhaps? <BR> <BR>Never used MM&#39;s myself. Anyone out there got anything
    good to say about them?

  body: Ole, set one page, go back to the client and show them the horror of it and
    get them to spring for another signature or two. Its only paper. I agree with
    Thomas, don&#39;t KO that much copy, its a real no no for long text.

  body: How can you guys see any image? I&#39;m on IE on Windows and see nothing.
    <BR> <BR>Ole, although the white-on-navy scheme doesn&#39;t raise a big red flag
    in my view, the rest does seem hairy. Gill I actually find ugly too, but Clearview
    is certainly not space-saving, quite the contrary - it likes it airy. Try looking
    for a wide&#42; font with a large x-height, a bit dark, and I guess stylish -
    this last bit will be hard though. I guess you want a sans? I just read &#40;on
    the ATypI list&#41; that there&#39;s a special version of Fedra for use by Collins
    dictionaries; that would be both economical and attractive, but only the Serif
    might have that special cut - and it might be proprietary. <BR> <BR>&#42; This
    actually helps apparent size while saving line height &#40;by using a smaller
    point size&#41;. Unless you have very few linebreaks, then narrowness &#40;at
    a larger point size&#41; might make more sense. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Ole <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t see any images either? But I&#39;ve followed this
    thread with rising interest. Seem a bit like &#34;Mission impossible&#34;, but
    you might find Stalemate suitable for this project? It was made to fit both for
    the web and in print, It&#39;s slightly condenced and therefor saving some space.
    Great care have been taken though, to perserve the &#34;white inner spaces&#34;
    of each letter. Also the big contrast in the weights &#40;light, medium and black&#41;
    could work nicely together sometimes. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll find Stalemate here:

  body: Ole, <BR> <BR>Clearview Compressed is much narrower than the Condensed. Why
    not send me a paragragh or two with specs and I&#39;ll make a sample for you.
