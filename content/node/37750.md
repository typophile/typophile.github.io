  body: "With such blurry images, and upside down no less, and with no further clues,
    this is going to be a tough one.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, you can find a good resource
    at http://www.vintagetype.com/\r\n\r\nThere you will find numerous samples of
    vintage typewriter faces based on particular models, and once you place the typewriter
    it should be relatively easy to place the timeframe.\r\n\r\n"

    contrast and sharpen them, then we'll talk. ;^)"
