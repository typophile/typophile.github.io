body: "Some questions regarding diacritics, precomposed glyphs and Unicode, whose
  partial answers I found in other threads:\r\n\r\nUnicode philosophy does not admits
  further inclusion of letters with diacritics if they can be achieved combining glyphs
  already coded. So glyphs like Yoruba's E acute with dot below will not be included
  in any future Unicode version: they must be mounted in client program (text editor)
  using base glyph plus combining diacritics.\r\n\r\nThe better way to get these combined
  glyphs without codepoint is <code>mark</code> feature. But this is still not supported
  by FontLab and most client programs. Even if we could do it with FontLab, there
  are kerning problems caused by some diacritics.\r\n\r\nLet's say you use <code>mark</code>
  feature to build something like \xEF. Here, diaeresis go further than the base glyph
  limits so the kerning bust be adjusted.\r\n\r\n<strong>(1)</strong> <em>How to handle
  kerning issues produced by diacritics in a </em><code>mark</code><em> scenario?.
  The font needs to have specific kerning exceptions for each combined glyph whose
  diacritics produce this effect?</em>\r\n\r\nIn other hand, you can simply ignore
  <code>mark</code> feature by now and add the precombined glyphs you need to the
  desired language support. Typed sequences are defined as substitutions in <code>ccmp</code>
  feature and no marks are necessary.\r\n\r\nAnyway, these precombined glyphs have
  no codepoint as they are out of Unicode specification. Without a codepoint these
  glyphs suffer some limitations: they cannot be inserted by keyboard codes or Windows
  Character map, they cannot be used in replace commands (except ID CS4+) and they
  are not searchable in PDF documents. Even the keyboard layout editors cannot reach
  them as these editors work based on Unicode.\r\n\r\n<strong>(2)</strong> <em>Is
  not a reasonable idea to set codepoints from PUA to these precombined glyphs?</em>.
  I see this is not ideal and far from Unicode original idea, but this method was
  adopted in some fonts. Although I understand this option has drawbacks, the advantages
  does not pays off?\r\n\r\nFinnally, combining diacritics are used both in <code>mark</code>
  and as components to precomposed glyphs. They must have zero width so they are keep
  before the zero limit. I cannot find any instruction about the position for these
  diacritics within this negative space. What I conclude from some fonts: usual way
  is to put the combining diacritic aligned as if there is an o before zero point.
  If you have uppercase variants, align them with O. Like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tela_09132010_225630_5141.jpg]\r\n\r\n.\r\n<strong>(3)</strong>
  <em>Is this a correct criteria or there are other issues related with combining
  diacritics positioning?</em> Actually, using anchors to handle components the position
  is not relevant. But for <code>mark</code> this seems to be essential.\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the long post, but I was not able to describe these details in a shorter way."

  body: "1. If using mark positioning, then you need contextual kern lookups to avoid
    collisions. For kerning to glyphs preceding the diacritic, you need a pair adjustment
    that uses the following mark glyphs as context. For glyphs that follow the diacritic,
    you can kern off the marks, although you need to take into account the possibility
    of stacked marks and mark order.\r\n\r\nAs I've expressed elsewhere on Typophile,
    the interaction of base glyph spacing and positioning (kerning) with mark positioning,
    is the weakest aspect of the OpenType architecture. The OT lookup structure makes
    this kind of work both arduous and inefficient.\r\n\r\n2. Avoid PUA codepoints
    like the plague. They should never be used for anything with semantic content.
    The correct way to handle precomposed diacritic glyphs representing combinations
    of Unicode base+mark(s) characters is to map them with ligature lookups in the
    'ccmp' OT Layout feature.\r\n\r\n3. There is no standard offset for marks on their
    zero widths. I tend to offset them as you have shown, over a medium width vowel
    such as o, since this ensures that they will have at least reasonable positioning
    even in software that doesn't support GPOS mark positioning. But it is just as
    valid to e.g. optically centre them on the zero-width. What I strongly recommend
    is that you offset them consistently, so that the same anchor or composite position
    can be used for all marks on a common base glyph."

  body: "Thanks a lot, John. As usual, you give excellent information.\r\n\r\nTo apply
    kerning to marks is really complicated. Even if FL6 supports marks, I'd prefer
    to use precomposed glyphs \u2013 at least by now.\r\n\r\nI still did not include
    my precomposed glyphs in <code>ccmp</code> feature. After this is properly set,
    user could get the precomposed glyph through code <code>uniXXXXYYYY</code>? Of
    course, one needs to use a consistent naming schema to make this work.\r\n"
