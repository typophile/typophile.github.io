  What do you think about Rosewood and Chaparral used in conjunction?\r\n\r\nhttp://vervesix.com/casa/bg_myspace.jpg\r\n\r\nDon't
  mind the kerning.. had to do it in Photoshop. I'd like to work with the Rosewood
  serifs more, even make a few ligatures (e.g. the lower adjacent ligatures of the
  'IS' in DISCO). Also, do you find the leading I chose annoying at all? I feel like
  there are both good and bad things happening where the letters touch...\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any constructive input!\r\nCasey"

    reason it\u2019s called \u201CRosewood Fill\u201D is because it\u2019s meant to
    be used as a fill layer to create chromatic letters</a>. "
