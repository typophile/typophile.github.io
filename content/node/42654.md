  but I would be eternally grateful if I could gage a reaction to the logomark I have
  designed below. If you could let me know what you can see in it, and the nature
  of the business that it is intended for that would be great!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dreamsarescape_3693.png]\r\n\r\nThankyou"

    on with the 'rubber' tip..?\r\n\r\nPersonal comments;\r\nKeep it simple. Is there
    too much going on? Strip it right down to the core. Will it work as 1 colour,
    grayscale even?\r\nIm still trying to figure out what its saying... or the wit
    within it, should I say.\r\n\r\nIll be interested to see what this turns out like.\r\n\r\n--\r\nRez

  body: "hello, im new to here, i think you will enjoy it!\r\n\r\nwhat this pencil
    brings me in mind... is the word VOID.\r\nwhy is that? well the first part is
    like an individual speaking on transmitting a message, thats where i get vo...
    (voice)  thi midle part brings me a (i) simply because of the shape and similarly
    the last part brings me out a (D)... so i see void and i actually like it a lot.\r\n\r\nI
    would say that the nature of business that this mark was intended to represent
    is a comunicational party, or transmitional party, something like blogs, probably,
    because of the fact that in blogs, people \"write\" their oppinions, they \"submit\"
    their thoughts ...\r\n\r\ni dont know if i got even close to what the logos actual
    work is but i think thta if you consider the above you will find that it is a
    pretty much logical explanation."

    to tell a novel-length story all by itself.\r\n\r\nThat said, I see a green pencil
    with a D on the end and a speaker icon on the front."

    ;)\r\n\r\nDo you think this will design will perform well for a design agency?
    or is the pencil a bit of a cliche??"

  body: "I'd say a pencil is cliche in the way scales of justice are cliche for a
    lawyer or a hammer is cliche for a carpenter.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's OK to use
    a cliche ;o)\r\n\r\nIt's a nicely designed pencil, so I'd say, sure, it will work
    just fine for that purpose."

    guessing the front of the pencil with the led is supposed to be some sort of waves?
    Sound waves?"
