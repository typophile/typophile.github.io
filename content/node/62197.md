  you please suggest a sans serif font that is a good combination with Centaur?\r\nAlso,
  would you recommend any other serif/sans serif font combinations which are historically
  relevant to art and museums?\r\nAny feedback would be much appreciated.\r\n...Thank
  you!"

    ITC Legacy Sans, for example.</cite>\r\n\r\nAn eminent choice. Ronald Arnholm's
    <em>Legacy</em> and <em>Legacy Sans</em> are based on the work of the Venice-based
    punchcutter Nicolas Jenson (as is Bruce Roger's <em>Centaur</em>). You might even
    use those two faces for the body and marginalia, respectively, and use <em>Centaur</em>
    for headings or as a display face. Robert Slimbach's <em>Adobe Jenson</em> also
    has much to recommend it, and like <em>Legacy</em> was designed on a computer
    (whereas <em>Centaur</em> is a digitization of a Monotype revival of a roman cut
    in 1469)."
