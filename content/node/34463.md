body: "Just something I did out of boredom...\r\nInspired by Joseph Yap who made a
  logo for his son (http://typophile.com/node/34024), I made a logo for myself. As
  you can (hopefully) see it's inspired by heavy metal logo's like Judas Priest &
  Iron Maiden. Not necessarely my kind of thing, but I've always liked the look of
  it, it's s\xF2\xF2\xF2 cheesy ;-)\r\nJust so you know, I'm not actually planning
  on using this. At least not until I've grown a Hogan Hulk moustache, a David Bowie
  (Ziggy Stardust period) mullet, expanded my wardrobe with some bandana's & start
  using make-up to accentuate my eyes ;-p"

  body: "Probably everybody has some problems reading it. It's not the top of the
    readable type anyway. :) Jokes aside. I can read it. Not as normal body text,
    but for logo it's fine. I was just struggling with the \"cs\" ending because to
    me that was a weird combination of letters. Checking your profile, I saw it is
    normal in your language.\r\n\r\nDid you try to make the ascender on \"k\" a bit
    higher to make the gap between \"t\" and \"k\" the same as it is with other letters?\r\n\r\nGradient
    is almost not visible. To me that means: discard or correct.\r\n\r\nBottom line:
    nice play on type."

  body: "I did have some problems with the gap between the k & t, but they don't line
    up well to make the ascender of the k higher. I gave preference to aligning the
    rest of the letters (o with u, m with c & s). I did think about adding a \"dirty
    splatter/spot\" (or maybe a star for that glamorous look) in the corner of the
    t & k to camouflage the gap, but I haven't found the right \"splatter\" yet ;-)\r\nThe
    gradient did look brighter in Illustrator, but I'm still playing with that for
    now. If I end up using it as a \"signature logo\", I'll probably adjust the colours
    to each design.\r\nThe cs-ending is actually not usual... Trust me, I always have
    to spell out my name about 50 times before people get it right ;-)\r\nThe name
    actually originates from Croatia, but has been \"butchered\" in the past (the
    rest of my family still spells it Lu'kac with a reversed ^ on the c)."

  body: "I've adjusted my k to \"fit\" into the t (and I made the stroke of the t
    a little longer to align with the ascender of the k again).. I'm not too sure
    whether the \"triangular gaps\" of the k are not too big now though. I kind of
    liked the smaller gaps, but I'll have to give myself a little time before I can
    compare the two results objectively (as far as that's possible ofcourse) ;-)\r\nI've
    made the gradient a little lighter as well which -I think- is definitely an improvement."

  body: "Ok. Luka\u010D then... :)\r\nGradient is now VERY visible. As you have said
    before, you'll adjust the gradient probably for press not screen.\r\n\r\nI'd keep
    the descended \"a\" because the second line is now not as dynamic as it was before.
    And there was a line from t to a. The first solution with \"k\" is better. This
    one looks like the stem is thinner than other strokes. I know it's of the same
    width but...\r\n\r\nYou could also try repositioning the first word horizontally."

  body: "> I'd keep the descended \"a\"\r\n\r\nI actually did keep it ;-)\r\nBut since
    I added it to the first logo at the very end & have about 20 different versions
    in my Illustrator document for comparison (anyone recognize this chaotic way of
    working?), I made a .gif of the wrong logo. I'd like to upload the last logo WITH
    the descended a, but I can't. Seems like technology has caught up with me once
    more... I'm still working on -prepare to laugh at my misfortune & backwater system-
    OS 9.1 & now that Typophile has also upgraded I can't upload anything anymore.
    Funnily enough, just a couple of days ago I posted a thread that I wasn't going
    to be participating actively anymore in any threads (just be a passive spy for
    a while due to certain circumstances), but I did want to keep posting on a few
    recent threads I started myself... Be careful what you wish for, right? ;-p\r\nAnyway,
    if anyone here wants to send me an email to aspronaut@gmail.com or tom.lukacs@telenet.be,
    I'll be glad to send him/her over the finished logo (so far at least) & give him/her
    permission to post it here for further comment.\r\nIf there's a real generous
    Samaritan here, he/she could also post a pdf on another thread of mine (http://typophile.com/node/34339).
    If I can get the pdf posted there, I can ask a friendly administor to delete all
    the other images in that thread.\r\nSuch a shame about the upgrade :-("
