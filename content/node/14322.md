  branches; the attachments show the central office and (in better clarity) one of
  the regional offices. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gos.gov.uk\r\n\r\nAll
  are part of the UK government.\r\n\r\nI've recently been asked, in my capacity as
  a designer at one of the offices, to help with branding guidelines. The current
  branding was issued in 1994, and is in use at 11 offices across England, each employing
  about 300 people (so maybe 3500 total). It appears on business cards, signage, stationery,
  PowerPoint presentations and everything else you'd associate with a large corporation.\r\n\r\nGiven
  the installed base, I can't recommend substantial alteration to the identity. But
  I am considering resetting the text. You'll have noticed it uses artificial small
  caps: in my opinion, this is a poor choice, particularly as the ITC New Baskerville
  used has a <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/itc-new-baskerville/\">small
  caps version</a>. Thus, I'm considering the following options:\r\n\r\n1. Leave everything
  as it is. This is cheapest, and no hassle.\r\n\r\n2. Switch to ITC New Baskerville
  (small caps), and recommend upgrading all signage, stationery and so on immediately
  at considerable expense.\r\n\r\n3. Switch to ITC New Baskerville (small caps), and
  recommend that it's implemented when possible (eg. change website immediately, b/c
  on next order, signage can remain).\r\n\r\n4. Recommend switching to one of the
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-baskerville/john-baskerville/\">other</a>
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/baskerville-mt/\">baskervilles</a> <a
  href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFoIMrsOT.php\">available</a>, and either update all
  immediately (as 2) or when necessary (as 3).\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts,
  and arguments for or against change. I need to make a presentation on this a week
  today; after that, I'd need to get buy-in at director level. Change is possible,
  but I need to project a very cogent case."

  body: "Well, IMHO *any* Baskerville is better than ITC's... I think Adobe's Berthold
    Baskerville has a lot more character and is probably more usable in an office
    environment (due to less contrast). Addin g the Book variant to the mix gives
    you even more options.\r\nBTW: These are available as OpenType."

    It has a great deal of flexibility, extensive language support, and is available
    in Type 1 and OpenType.\r\n\r\nYou'd have to test it out, but I bet you could
    implement in stages, a la your option 3, without anyone noticing."

  body: i cast my vote for [[storm type foundry|storm's]] john baskerville as well,
    if you're able to make a switch. i would advise against setting text in [[mrs
    eaves]].

    without anyone noticing? \r\n\r\nBear in mind also that it will being used for
    display only, as the attachments I sent. Largest size will be A0 signage, smallest
    size a business card (or web graphic). Maybe I need different versions to cope
    with this."

  body: By the way, could someone with these fonts send me the text "Government Offices
    for the English Regions" in small caps? I'd understand if you don't want to send
    outlines, but a PNG at least as good as PDF specimen sheets would save me heaps
    of time making a presentation.

    found some Baskervilles not previously mentioned (look near the top of <a href=\"http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/choice.html\">this
    page</a>), including Timberwolf's Baskerville 1757. My graphic compares this with
    ITC New Baskerville, Storm's John Baskerville, and Mrs Eaves.\r\n\r\nTwo Baskervilles
    I couldn't find samples of, and would have considered, are the <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90131.html\">Berthold</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=243211\">Monotype</a>
    versions. Are these worth pursuing? \r\n\r\nSo far, I'm favouring ITC New Baskerville,
    since it's nearest to what we're already using. The Storm design has a low small
    caps height, which I'm not keen on. I do really like Mrs Eaves, although it's
    a bit of a departure. Viewed with the arms, they look like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://gtmail.150m.com/Arms-version.gif\r\n\r\nI
    think what I might do, rather than giving the decision makers the choice between
    artificial small caps (as we have now) and genuine small caps, is to give them
    the choice between ITC small caps and Mrs Eaves. I'd be happy with either."

    like a plan. There is such a thing as freedom <strong>from</strong> choice too!\r\n\r\nTo
