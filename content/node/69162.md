  mostly text with very few pictures. A very classic approach in design but well done.
  Do you know of good editorials that i could take a look at the use of typography
  and design? I thought on Penguins Books, maybe some Phaidon ones but i cannot think
  of another one. \r\n\r\nAny help or ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nS"

    Both are very classy, easy-to-read typefaces. If you're looking for actual samples
    of books, try the Amazon.com preview reader. You can look at pretty much any book
    out there up close.\r\n"

    will check Book Antigua since i don't remember it quite well. \r\nAnyhow do you
    know of Editorials with concern in quality book design that might appear at Amazon?
    I guess Penguin it well known...\r\n\r\n"

    title will do, as he's basically designed them all). If you can find a copy of
    his book <em>Life Style,</em> he devotes many pages to this topic, and even specifies
    some 40 or so composition rules that he follows for Zone Books. It is all very
    sound advice.\r\n\r\nOther excellent points of reference are some of the better
    designed titles from MIT, as well as anything put out by the Princeton Architectural
    Press.\r\n\r\nThe work of Richard Eckersley is superlative, but harder to come
    by. (He did many titles for the University of Nebraska Press, among others.)"

    Mau...now that you said i am connecting the dots, he is the designer of the famous
    Architecture book  S,M, L, XL, of Rem Koolhaas one of my favorite studios. I will
    try to get Life Stye if it available somewhere in Spain.\r\n\r\nMIT and Princeton
    Architectural Press are good tips as well, i guess there more easy info on the
    net. \r\n\r\nI just found some samples of Richard Eckersley\r\nhttp://nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu/~mrogal/th5.html\r\n\r\nis

    in love with the cover) and I love flicking through it for ideas.   It covers
    lots of different editorial designs, including magazines etc, which won't relate
    to your book exactly, but it might help inspire you...\r\n"

  body: With Penguin, just try and pick up one of the older (orange/green/blue) paperbacks
    for a few pennies on amazon (or at a second-hand bookshop) to look at the layout
    and typesetting. They're all just based on golden section rules, there's a load
    of information online if you dig around, and here's [[http://ronin-group.org/misc_etext_tschichold.html|Jan
    Tischgold's composition rules]]. Monotype Joanna, Monotype Plantin and Linotype
    Pilgrim show up frequently, all would be good choices. Joanna and Pilgrim are
    both Eric Gill typefaces, very good, make very readable book text.

  body: I should mention that Bruce Mau plainly acknowledges his debt to Jan Tschichold,
    and there exists a clear lineage between the two men's respective rules of composition.
    Both are worthy of close study. Bruce Mau elected to set all of the Zone Books
    in Eric Gill's Perpetua, which Tschichold had been known to use to great effect.
    (Many of the classic Penguin covers were of course set in Gill Sans).

    the posibilites of Eric Gill's Perpetua. I will take a look at Zone Books as well
    as \"Great British Editorial\" if i can get a hold at Amazon. I didn't know about
    the connection between Bruce Mau and Jan Tschichold, that is interesting indeed.\r\n\r\nI
    became very much interesting in Golden Section as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    good info. Editorial and Book Design is definitely an Art. \r\n"

  body: "Sebastian, the Tschichold/Penguin approach is a great reference - one of
    the greatest editorial design achievement of XX century, though it should not
    be taken as an absolute reference *per se*. Tschichold was a master in book design,
    and was central in reviving the quality editorial design in popular literature
    during last century, but one should always consider that he was a man thinking
    and working some forty/fifty/sixty years ago, in a completely different technological
    environment. That is to say, for example, that the typefaces he used and championed
    (in letterpress years) aren't necessarily the best ones to use today. I, for example,
    would think twice before setting a book in Perpetua or Joanna: excellent metal
    types (see Gill's essay \"On Typography\") with a weak digital translations. Same
    for the Golden Section - setting a double page spread with those proportions can
    be risky if you don't mind having a very narrow inner/very wide outer and bottom
    margins (and you should always consider how the book will be binded - softcover
    of hardcover?). So, if you're after some good editorial book design (in the essay
    genre), first of all I would have a look to your local bookshops and libraries,
    I'm sure there's tons of good stuff among Spanish publishers. Then I would consider
    using a contemporary typefaces; and if you're after a revival, there are some
    great *recent* digital interpretations to consider, both in the Renaissance/Venetian/Garamondish/Humanistic
    and in the Neoclassical/Romantic types. Finally, here is a quick link to the work
    of a great book designer (see the illustrated books section in particular):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.matthewavery.com/index.php?/projects/illustrated-books/"

  body: "I didn't mean to suggest that Bruce Mau's use of Perpetua had anything to
    do with Jan Tschichold (I have no evidence either way). It's a superb design.
    Ordinarily I would agree with Nicola's assessment of the face's digital incarnation,
    but for Zone Books it was an inspired choice. An outwardly correct form, slightly
    sculptural, but with a subtle hint of perversity. In their pages I have even noted
    a customized version, where the ascenders/descenders of the italic <em>f</em>
    have been, how shall I put it, somewhat \"castrated\"&mdash;\r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    recommend it to a novice.\r\n\r\n"

    for the slow reply i was out in a rugby tour. \r\n\r\nncaleffi, indeed interesting
    to take Jan Tschichold reference but be aware of today's technological changes.
    Good point about Golden Section as well, not sure which will be the binding system
    now. I believe it will be softcover with maximum 80 to 100 pages. Actually is
    more of a Journal, Essays Books than a regular narrative biger book. I like Avery
    work, very nice indeed.\r\n\r\nChristopher, i did check some Zone Books on the
    net, not a physical one and they seem to be very quite originally designed.\r\n
