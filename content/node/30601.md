  or how to say it...but here goes:\r\n\r\nFrom my screen name, you can kind of tell
  I like icy things, and I've been searching for a font that would fit that somehow.
  However, I have not yet found one that was \"sharp\" and \"cold\" enough, reminiscient
  of ice and icicles and things like that, without looking evil. Any suggestions?
  Ideas?"
