  body: "For the handwritten fonts, I think the easiest thing you might want to do
    is go to dafont and find some freebies. Alternatively, there are hundreds of commercial
    fonts available all over the place that will give you the same results, usually
    with a better quality of production.\r\n\r\nFor the \"Kate Spade\" font Decotura
    or Bedega Sans might do the trick.\r\n\r\nAlso might want to look at:\r\nCasablanca\r\nModified
    Gothic\r\nCarlos\r\nLinotype Avenida\r\nPlaza\r\nHuxley Vertical"
