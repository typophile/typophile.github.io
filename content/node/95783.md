  body: "I'm going to guess that this is custom and hand drawn. Look here:\r\nhttp://www.downeast.com/about/downeastenterprises\r\n\r\n<em>\"Fifty-nine
    years ago, the slim first issue of a regional magazine appeared on selected newsstands
    throughout the length and breadth of Maine. On the cover, a stylized woodcut of
    a Maine harbor was topped by a hand-painted logo with the words \u201CDown East\u201D
    \u2014 a reference to the practice of sailing downwind to the east in order to
    reach Maine from Boston during the great age of sail. The new magazine, which
    was loosely modeled on The New Yorker, was the brainchild of a Mainer named Duane
    Doolittle.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.downeast.com/files/images/DE%20First%20Cover.thumbnail.jpg\">\r\n"
