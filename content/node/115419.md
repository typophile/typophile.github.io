body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font query_5307.png]\r\nI am trying to
  locate this font.\r\nIt was used by my church for this December, 1990 bulletin.\r\nI
  can find similar fonts, but not all the letters and numbers match up.\r\nThe numbers
  0 and 2 and letters A, G, R, C, and K seem to never match up.\r\nI have been searching
  font sites for over a year without any luck.\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n"
