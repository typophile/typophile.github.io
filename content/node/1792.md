body: A couple of months ago, there was a thread discussing which was the sexiest
  letter, which presupposed a context of the Latin script. This thread is now buried
  in the archives, but I would like to revive it solely for the purpose of pointing
  out that <i>there are no sexy letters in the Latin script.</i> At least, not compared
  to these sinuous, copulating beauties from the Buginese, or Lontara, script. <BR><img

    <BR>And is a writing system sexier if you can&#39;t read it? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: no [comma, pause] ambiguity makes it sexier, because we have to take the shapes
    shown to us and imagine what they mean.

  body: The problem with symbols you don&#39;t know what they mean can best be illustrated
    by this story. I was given a jacket with an embrorded Dragon on it. I work in
    Manhattan, NY. I was comuting at the time to CT and on the train a business man
    who did alot of traveling to the far east asked me if I knew what the Dragon symbol
    ment. I told him I didn&#39;t. He told me it was a symbol of a gang and if I went
    into the wrong part of town I could get shot. I stopped wearing that jacket to
    work.
