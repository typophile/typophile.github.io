body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am a type enthusiast living in Sydney Australia, and have been
  frustrated by the lack of organisations and interest groups inspired by our wonderful
  world of typography.\r\n\r\nRather than get frustrated, I have decided to do something
  about it, and am going to establish an <i>informal</i> club called <strong>The Australian
  Typography Club</strong>. Inspired by organisations like <a href=\"http://www.typocircle.co.uk/\">The
  Typographic Circle</a>, and <a href=\"http://typeclub.com/\">Type Club of Toronto</a>,
  the purpose of our club will be <i>to promote choosing, using, and creating great
  typography</i>.\r\n\r\nThe short version of this thread is that I am seeking advice
  and direction regarding:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>setting up a typography club</li>\r\n<li>knowledge
  of the type scene in Australasia</li>\r\n<li>general guidance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIf
  you can help, please read on!\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\n<strong>ABOUT ME</strong>\r\nIn
  the world of typography, I am just another keen user (a mere nobody). What's worse,
  I write quite messy (but that's another thread). I am however a very capable person,
  and run a publishing design studio in Sydney. I will make sure The Australian Typography
  Club succeeds.\r\n\r\n<strong>ABOUT TYPE IN SYDNEY</strong>\r\nFor the past couple
  of months, I scoured high and low to find any sort of organisations, group, or course
  concerned with type. Bonus points for anything in Sydney. Results:\r\n\r\nThere
  is <a href=\"http://www.agda.com.au\">The Australia Graphic Design Association (AGDA)</a>.
  Many have their views on AGDA - and I have heard them being described as inaccessible
  or irrelevant. Most importantly, I do not believe there is a focus group concerned
  with typography. To be honest, I'm a little hesitant to contact these people.\r\n\r\nThere
  is an online community <a href=\"http://www.australianinfront.com.au\">Australian
  INFront</a>. This is a great online only community, with respect of typography.\r\n\r\nEducation-wise:
  There are the usual type subjects taught as part of tertiary courses. Various industry
  short courses also exist, for example run by <a href=\"http://www.aftrs.edu.au/aboutus/contactus/nswact.aspx\">AFTRS</a>
  \"<a href=\"http://www.aftrs.edu.au/courses/industryshortcourses/findacourse/typographyforthescreen.aspx?iteration_id=5803&PEPICourseID=138\">Typography
  for the Screen</a>\". Oh dear, but this is run in Melbourne.\r\n\r\nIf you're aware
  of other organisations, groups or courses relating to type in Australia, please
  let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>PURPOSE OF THE CLUB</strong>\r\nThe mission of our
  club will be <i>to promote choosing, using, and creating great typography</i>.\r\n\r\nOn
  a day-to-day level, the purpose of the club would be to create a real-life community
  for type enthusiasts to meet, collaborate, and learn. Meetings would be held periodically
  (in my studio if needed), where Australian typography enthusiasts of all ages can
  discuss <i>choosing</i>, <i>using</i>, and <i>creating</i> great typography.\r\n\r\nAs
  a 27 year-old, I have a personal interest to get younger professionals / uni students
  involved. The type scene exists in Australia. There's a type gene in our DNA - we
  just have to get together.\r\n\r\n \r\n<strong>ESTABLISHING THE CLUB</strong>\r\nAs
  an informal, not for profit, general interest club, I would imagine that the membership
  would steer it's direction over time. It however firstly needs to be established.\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  following are 3 issues I would love advice with. Please help!</strong>\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\n<strong>==>
  Issue 1 of 3: <i>What is Australian Type?</i></strong>\r\nWhen it comes to type,
  Australia is no New York or Amsterdam. Heck, we're only 220 years old. Compared
  to other cities, there is little historical culture. How can we define Australian
  Type? What is it? Is there such a thing? Where have we come from, and where are
  we going? Is it even important that there is such as thing as Australian type?\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>==>
  Issue 2 of 3: <i>Attracting the right leaders</i></strong>\r\nWe would love to attract
  respected and knowledgeable type industry leaders to be involved in the club in
  some way. Those in Industry, type designers, foundries, educators. Who are these
  people in Australia?\r\n\r\n<i>From Industry</i>:\r\nDevelopers: I am aware of Elliot
  Harper, Chapter Rep of the <a href=\"http://www.indesignusergroup.com/chapters/sydney/\">Sydney
  Adobe InDesign Users Group</a>. Also <a href=\"http://www.creativesweettv.com/\">Mike
  McHugh</a>, Creative Systems Engineer at Adobe - a fantastic Adobe CS trainer.\r\n\r\nAgencies:
  My knowledge of type specialist in design agencies in Australia is limited. There
  are of course highly respected agencies like <a href=\"http://www.frostdesign.com.au/\">Frost
  Design</a>, and others specialising specifically in type, magazine and newspaper
  redesign. Problem is: I am not aware of who the gurus are.\r\n\r\n<i>Type Designers
  / Foundries</i>: \r\nUnfortunately drawing major blanks here. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/1519\">Kris
  Sowerby</a> of KLIM fame is from New Zealand. That's the closest I get.\r\n\r\n<i>Educators</i>:
  \r\nThey lurk around teaching courses in places such as <a href=\"http://www.billyblue.com.au\">Billy
  Blue</a> and TAFE Enmore amongst others. They know their stuff. With more homework
  I can find out these peoples names', but would love some help.\r\n\r\nAttracting
  these people involves inviting them to contribute at meetings with talks, help set
  up the club, or merely come along for the ride, if they're at all interested. Remember
  it's about choosing, using, and creating.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>==> Issue 3 of 3: <i>Getting
  members to join</i></strong>\r\nGet issue 2 right, and this one should be quite
  easy. \r\n\r\nFor industry professionals: word could spread with the right seeds
  planted.\r\n\r\nFor young professionals and uni students, from first hand experience
  I know there are plenty of young enthusiasts out there. Promoting typography to
  up and comers is only positive for the industry. Quite easy and effective to contact
  design colleges, I also hear a community announcement on FBI radio etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================\r\n\r\nSo
  all in all, I'm keen to hear any words of <i>advice, direction, or comments</i>
  about the ambition for The Australian Typography Club. \r\n\r\n...especially in
  relation to the <strong>3 issues raised</strong>, and names of people / type designers
  / foundries / gurus.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anyone from other type clubs who also could
  provide advice?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help and advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n*edited to expand
  scope to Australia (was initially Sydney based only)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nA <a
  href=\"http://forums.australiantype.org/viewforum.php?f=3\">Forum</a> has been established.
  Please help out if you can!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://forums.australiantype.org/viewforum.php?f=3\">http://forums.australiantype.org/viewforum.php?f=3</a>"

  body: "Hi Nathan. Great idea and I'm all for it. Trouble is I live in Melbourne.
    I've been travelling to Sydney on PR consult jobs this year, but I'm only there
    for a few days at a time and it's very hard to convince my employers to let me
    have any time off for things like type club meetings, or anything else for that
    matter. Mainly I'm employed as a brand consultant, AD and writer.\r\n\r\n<em>There
    is The Australia Graphic Design Association (AGDA). Many have their views on AGDA
    - and I have heard them being described as inaccessible or irrelevant. Most importantly,
    I do not believe there is a focus group concerned with typography. To be honest,
    I\u2019m a little hesitant to contact these people.</em>\r\n\r\nMe too. I've had
    some contact with AGDA in the past and found them rather inaccessible and largely
    inactive. Certainly they didn't express much interest in typography.\r\n\r\n<em>Type
    Designers / Foundries:\r\nUnfortunately drawing major blanks here. Kris Sowerby
    of KLIM fame is from New Zealand. That\u2019s the closest I get.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm
    one of Melbourne's indie type designers / font manufacturers. There are others
    here, but I've had no contact with them, largely by choice because I'm very indie
    and like to work on my own, figure it all out for myself. Now that I'm established
    I'm getting more comissions, and I may be about to sign a deal with a high-profile
    indie retail / custom type outfit in London, who I cannot name at this time.\r\n\r\nOne
    other Melbourne type designer is Graham Meade:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/meade/graham/\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure where the following people are located:\r\n\r\nJan Schmoeger:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/schmoeger/jan/\r\n\r\nWayne
    Thompson:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/thompson/wayne/\r\n\r\nJesse
    Andrew Tilley:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/tilley/jesse/andrew/\r\n\r\nIn
    Sydney there's Russell Bean:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/bean/russell/\r\n\r\nThere's
    a list of Aussie type people at Myfonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/country/au/\r\n\r\nOut
    of all those people, the fonts I've made appear to be the most serious as far
    as typographic design goes. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/arboghast/james/\r\n\r\nI'm
    not prolific, and the best is yet to come, but out of the two main retail fonts
    I released last year, all two of them made the Typographica best fonts of 2007
    list. I figure that's a good sign. I'm just moving into text fonts now.\r\n\r\nFor
    the time being it's best if you ask me what I can do for you and your endeavor.
    I'm happy to talk about it here online or we can converse by email.\r\n\r\nj a

    Stephen Banham lives and works in Melbourne, in case you didn't know. I first
    heard of him five or more years ago when he began his anti-Helvetica campaign.
    Letterbox is not a \"foundry\" by the way. It's a font making outfit.\r\n\r\nWhat
    makes you think we did not know of Stephen Banham? Thanks man, you're all heart.
    Perhaps Nathan knows of Stephen Banham too but also omitted to mention him. People
    have reasons for omitting to mention things and it shouldn't be at all surprizing.
    It has to do with being human and making errors.\r\n\r\nHave a great day Kris!\r\n\r\nj

    like to, so life is pretty tough for me. Just keeping my day job going is a struggle.
    Establishing and running a type business as James Yencken and Jonno Bellew have

    amazing, so inspiring, and so much fun. I\u2019m already saving my pennies for
    next year.</em>\r\n\r\nTypecon is a type trade show where (this year for instance)
    400 of the 470 attendees were there to flog their wares. A certain amount of commercialization
    is neccessary to support industry conferences, but still I find it hard to get
    enthusiastic about paying $350 (add a few grand in airfares and accomodation on
    top of that) to go to a convention where more than half the presentations are
    of no consequence or interest to me, and where most people are consuming alcohol.
    That turns me off, because I don't drink. I'm a smoker and I'm damn proud of it.
    The other problem for me with Typecon is I'm no type nerd. I'm an artist and a
    writer.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, I think Typecon is great for the people who like
    and enjoy that kind of thing, and I wish SOTA and the Typecon people all the best
    in future gatherings. Everything has its place in this world. I don't dislike
    Typecon nor am I anti-Typecon or anti-Type nerd. It just isn't for me.\r\n\r\nAt
    least I don't think it is, but I would very much love to be convinced otherwize.
    Typophiles you are most welcome to turn me around on this. Convince me. Tell me
    why I should go.\r\n\r\nBut enuff sour grapes. It's telling that James Yencken,
    a designer, knows of other designers interested in typography as well as actual
    type designers in Melbourne. I'm out of touch with the design scene since I mainly
    work in public relations, as a writer of business collateral, creative concepts
    for ads and some corporate branding. I have kept my interest in type going however
    by forging a career as a typeface designer and font maker. That's not well supported
    by my daytime contract work, but I guess I can't have everything.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    wouldn\u2019t jump right on the AGDA hate bandwagon fellas.</em>\r\n\r\nI appreciate
    what you are saying there, but your choice of words has a polarizing effect. Leave
    out \"hate\" and \"bandwagon\" please. \"Hate\" is a dangerous corrosive word
    and we're all better off not using it. It has a corrosive effect.\r\n\r\nThe opinion
    I expressed of ADGA earlier is based on contact I made with them and their utter
    lack of responsiveness. They didn't return my any of my calls or emails, and I
    made quite a few of them. I am very professional in my business correspondence,
    much more professional than you may see me from time to time in online discussions
    at Typophile. I made the effort to establish repore with ADGA repeatedly and got
    nothing in return, not one word, not one call back. What else am I supposed to
    make of that?\r\n\r\n<em>They put on some good events and the people in charge
    in Melbourne are a young progressive bunch.</em>\r\n\r\nGood for them and I wish
    them all the best with their endeavors. Sorry, but in my estimation they have
    a colossal amount to learn about professionalism and how to communicate.\r\n\r\n<em>They
    would almost definitely support any kind of type initiative; but everyone involved
    in AGDA is also a busy designer with limited time.</em>\r\n\r\nI think you should
    speak for yourself, and let them speak for themselves. And James, please take
    all of what I'm saying in good faith as it's meant that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Pat Armstrong:

    The Type Club\r\n- pre general membership phase\r\n- attracting the right stakeholders:
    type designers, supporters\r\n- penciling an initial mission/charter/purpose\r\n-
    establishing what 'membership' is\r\n- thinking about real-life events\r\n\r\nPhase
    2: Attracting Membership\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Organising the first event(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly
    thoughts on Membership:\r\n- goes without saying that this is a not-for-profit
    club\r\n- target base: design professionals, design students, enthusiasts, type
    designers, educators, academics\r\n- membership is free for type designers, students,
    academics\r\n- $20/pa design professionals and general enthusiasts\r\n- hard to
    draw a line I understand\r\n\r\n- Membership gets you:\r\n--- the Australian Typography
    Yearbook posted to you annually, which showcases the best of Australian type.
    Type designers contribute and showcase their work here. (I am a publisher and
    can produce the yearbook cheap but nice.)\r\n--- admission to type events\r\n---
    other stuff (provided by supporters)\r\n--- tshirt? (may need to bump up membership),
    but need to keep it down too\r\n\r\n\r\nA website link will be published on this
    thread when the time is right, where others can help with Phase 1, and become
    part of the core founders. There's no way I can do this on my own. ETA: 1 week.\r\n\r\nKeen
    to hear any other opinions, thoughts + advice. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is what people say about Typecon and what I can see in photos of the event each
    year. Obviously attending one in person will make the picture much clearer for
    me. I'm sorry I generalized, but that is human nature. As for my opinions, well,
    I am not sorry for having opinions based on observation from a distance. Fact&#8212;people
    tell me Typecon is packed with nerds. That isn't my opinion, it's what people
    tell me, including people who have been to Typecon.\r\n\r\nWhat else am I supposed

  body: "The quickest way to get this off the ground will be to establish a website
    with blog / wiki. I'm very keen to help with that stuff.\r\n\r\n@Nathan\r\n<em>Agencies:
    My knowledge of type specialist in design agencies in Sydney is limited. There
    are of course highly respected agencies like Frost Design, and others specialising
    specifically in type, magazine and newspaper redesign. Problem is: I am not aware
    of who the gurus are.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat baffles me is why so few of Australia's
    type specialists or gurus show up at Typophile. Typophile can seem bewildering,
    elitist, even offputting at times, depending on the topic being discussed. But
    it's an international community with a lot to offer, and to be part of it you
    have to roll with the punches and take a tolerant, long-term view. You (Nathan)
    and other Aussies have done that. You made the effort and now you're getting something
    really great in return. I've had my darker moments and occasional loss of faith,
    but in the end I stuck with Typophile. I'm still here.\r\n\r\nSo where are Australia's
    big shot type people? Why aren't they Typophilers? This curious dearth of Australian
    presence puzzles me.\r\n\r\n<em>The Sydney Typography Club</em>\r\n\r\nIs it going
    to be named that, or The Australian Typography Club, or The Australian Typographic
    Board as David Sudweeks is suggesting, or something else? Irrespective of where
    meetings and events are held and where the organization is headquartered, naming
    it The Australian Typography Club (or something similar) will go a long way towards
    securing membership from every state. I saw the <em>*edited to expand scope to
    Australia</em> bit, so does that mean we can substitute each instance (or most
    instances) of \"Sydney\" with \"Australia\"?\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm not into is
    the notion of Melbourne as Australia's culture capital. Currently I don't subscribe
    to that view, even tho I unwittingly repeated the myth several years ago on the
    page about me at Planet Typographie. Sydney is a very cultured place, no less
    so than Melbourne, just different. I hope you and other interested parties in
    Sydney can see beyond the Sydney versus Melbourne thing too, because it's a load
    of bunk with the potential to derail a national type society. \r\n\r\nj a m e
