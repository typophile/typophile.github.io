  a screen grab of the video just gives me a mysterious black rectangle, so you'll
  need to check out the clip yourself:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJteBqThugg\r\n\r\nAnyone
  recognize it?"

  body: Thanks for the screen grab, iDoc. The "a" on Monday at :07 is very distinctive,
    too.

  body: I like Antenna, but it seems odd that they would switch so soon after their
    <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/klavika06.html">Klavika</a>
    stuff which still looks quite current.

  body: Thanks for the ID! They still use Klavika. I can't be sure, but I think Klavika
    is used in promos where they leave a show's logo intact, and Antenna is used when
    they replace logos with a cohesive font. I think single-show promotions mostly
    use Klavika, and there may be a distinction made for dramas vs comedies. During
    the summer, Avant Garde was filling the role of Antenna during their "All-American
    Summer" campaign.
