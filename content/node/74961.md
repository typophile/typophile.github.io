body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nSomething new is preparing slowly and this is just small preview
  of one of them.\r\n\r\nIt's called \"Passage\" and for now it has only 2 styles.
  Currently working on one more (higher contrast of \"Passage Decor\") and have one
  more decorative idea on my mind.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TDF_Passage_6215.jpg]\r\n<strong>Passage</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TDF_Passage_Decor_4798.jpg]\r\n<strong>Passage
  Decor</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a couple of days I will attach some more previews
  with longer texts and other tests, this is everything for now.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think?\r\nWasted time or not? :)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDusan"

    the round and straight parts on the U could be a bit smoother? And the leg of
    the R looks like it goes in a little to me.\r\n\r\nKeep going."

    is weird somehow, like it's not the same style as the rest of characters.\r\nAbout
    /U/... need to rethink a little. I know what are you saying.\r\n\r\nJust made
    something extra.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScreenShot242_5825.png]\r\n<strong>Passage

  body: That new image looks great! With the R, what if you changed it so the leg
    is straight, and connects to the bowl instead of the stem? That would still keep
    the old American-ish and art-deco feel, but would probably make it fit better
    overall.

    right about them. They look annoying and queerish  a little."

  body: It would also be very good to have an alternate B, since that structure wont
    work in every situation. Although,  it definitely looks good on the "America Bananaman
    Panama" example from earlier.

    now, there will be 4 styles (Normal, Light Decor, Regular Decor and Initials).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    is a try to make something little bit different, maybe with more modern look,
    but it's going to need a lot of time to make something our from it. For now it's
    just a try.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScreenShot246_5566.png]"
