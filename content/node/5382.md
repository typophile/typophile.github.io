      looking for a font that replicates the McDonalds font, and as you know, it doesn't
      exist. Its not for money and just an assignment. is there any way i can get
      the one that you created? thanks!

  body: Is it immoral?  <BR>Strictly speaking, yes. It is pandering to greed &#40;something
    for nothing&#41;, which is one of the sins. <BR>Now it could be argued that it&#39;s
    altruistic to provide fonts for the poor souls who can&#39;t afford them. <BR>But
    the fact is, everyone who has access to the Web is on a computer which comes supplied
    with fonts sufficient for the basic necessitties of typesetting.

    not stupid, because quite honestly the quality of my fonts &#40;I can admit it&#41;
    isn&#39;t such that I could expect any money for them.  <BR> <BR>The only negative
    aspect I could see is that it dissuades people from buying the fonts of people
    who design and sell good ones. But no one is owed a living doing XY and Z... if
    you can make a living at it, well and good. If you can&#39;t, do something else.

    Obviously there&#39;s a difference between home users who just want fun fonts
    and professional users prepared to pay for a quality product. I got some nice
    mails from folks who&#39;d used my fonts in church missives and things like that.
    That said, I also saw my work cropping up in shop displays, on the sides of buses,
    one was even used in a TV news feature. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say it&#39;s not immoral
    as long as they&#39;re your own designs &#40;not derivative&#41; and you make
    no claims over quality, that could lead to a muddying the typographic waters.
    There are many more immoral things to do......

    are putting together a website &#40;I&#39;ll post the URL after it launches in
    a week and a half&#41;. <BR> <BR>We want to open our platform up to other interested
    students at our school as well. Last week, we began to think about what we wanted
    to be as a group, what we stood for, etc... This way, it would be easy for us
    to figure out which other students/work would be a good fit for us and our collective&#39;s
    site. <BR> <BR>Several of us have worked &#34;in the nearby type industry.&#34;
    We all have strong feelings about type design, and plan to continue focusing our
    studies/lives/etc. toward that. Anyway, here are our general guidelines for type
    that can be displayed on the site: <BR> <BR>1. the work may not be derivative
    <BR>2. the work may not be available anyhere as a free font at the moment <BR>3.
    the work should be &#34;good&#34; enough. By good enough, we mean, that we as
    a group should all be able to sit and talk about it. Of course, none of us are
    professional type designers, so &#34;good&#34; is still relative. But we have
    to set the bar for ourselves somewhere. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, there are students
    at our school who make typeface design experiments that are derivative. As a group,
    we are all in agreement that derivative work is bad, and that we should not support
    it. <BR> <BR>While we all agree that we don&#39;t want to create a free font site,
    I&#39;m not so sure that we are all in agreement about the distribution of free
    fonts in general. I tend to agree with Nick, and think that free fonts hurt the

  body: I should add that although I don&#39;t think giving away fonts for free is
    immoral, I do think it tends to devalue type, and is usually bad for the type
    industry and those who wish to make their living at type. <BR> <BR>So, if the
    question is, should we give away some fonts, given that we don&#39;t care whether
    we make money, I&#39;d say &#34;that depends.&#34; Personally, I&#39;d suggest
    you decide what you think the fonts are worth, and charge that amount for them.
    They might be quite cheap. I guess the problem with that is that getting into
    the whole e-commerce setup might be expensive and troublesome, given that you
    don&#39;t expect to charge much. I wonder what one would do for sort of &#34;poor
    man&#39;s e-commerce&#34;? Maybe let people pay with PayPal, and email them their
    fonts afterwards? Say, you could auction the fonts on e&#42;Bay! Okay, now I&#39;m
    getting silly.... <BR> <BR>Seriously, though, one element of the problem is that
    most users don&#39;t understand the quality difference between most of the free
    and shareware fonts and high quality well crafted fonts. So as long as there are
    lots of free fonts, they think people are &#34;greedy&#34; or something if they
    want to charge for fonts. <BR> <BR>What I do think is unethical is making knockoffs
    of existing retail fonts &#40;whether free or not&#41;, or distributing other
    people&#39;s retail fonts illegally &#40;piracy&#41;. <BR> <BR>My two cents. <BR>

    seems immoral to me. <BR> <BR>I understand the argument that it may devalue the
    work of type designers in general, but I&#39;d present <a href="http://www.yale.edu/printer/typeface/typeface.html">the
    Yale typeface</a> as a good counter example. Granted, it&#39;s not free to <i>all</i>,
    but it is free to students and faculty. It&#39;s an example, in my opinion, of
    an organization absorbing the cost for the general betterment of their typographic
    environment. This strikes me as a moral act, or at the very least an act that
    isn&#39;t immoral. Proper credit and emphasis are also given to the designer and
    the intentions associated with the font family&#39;s designs, which contributes
    to my support for this project. <BR> <BR>Personally, if taking things that&#39;re
    free means I&#39;m greedy, then I was greedy by reading Typophile before contributing,
    where I got insights, opinions, and help for free. I also offered them up without
    the promise of reciprocation from any individual I helped &#40;and still do&#41;.
    Distribution of free fonts &#40;or software, for that matter&#41; can be done
    in the name of public good and open exchange of ideas, which has little to do
    with commerce and a lot to do with growth and community. <BR> <BR>I buy fonts,
    but I also download and appreciate generous free offerings such as Unibody and
    Silkscreen. I don&#39;t think honest, well-intended distribution of personal work
    is the problem. The gauging of type&#39;s value by the public at large is influenced
    much more thoroughly by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe than by John Doe&#39;s Personal

    <BR>If an artist comes into a community and tries to give away free badly done
    paintings, people probably won&#39;t take them. I think that&#39;s because people
    have more opinions about painting.. Type is a field focused on very small differences
    &#40;compared to painting, sculpture, etc. where differences are more readily
    noticed&#41; It takes more time and patience to understand type, whereas someone
    can look at a painting and right away tell you if they like it or not. Even at
    young ages, all children have favorite colors, but once they learn to read, do
    they have favorite typefaces? Would they, if someone taught them earlier? I really
    think they would, but perhaps I&#39;m just being hopeful.. <BR>Anyhow, educating
    people somehow about type is the fastest way to ending free-font webpages.  <BR>
    <BR>So then, would it be ok to teach them for free? <BR> <BR>We want people to
    appreciate good design, but how much are you willing to give away? Should people
    keep their good advice to themselves? Hopefully not! <BR> <BR>The bigger problem
    is that most people don&#39;t want to take the time to know. Design is something
    we feel like we have to do. Its an option for the general public, and then the
    only thing that matters is if it matches the bedspread. I&#39;m exaggerating..
    I really do think though if it were explained to them in an interesting way, and
    not at 20,000&#43; a year, then more type would sell, and the need for good design
    might be more appreciated. <BR>

    loved to read and I loved to read books that had a certain type in them.  I never
    learned the names of the type I liked, but I did recognize that certain types
    made the reading experience better, the way good paper did. <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m
    working in a specialized web design field and I need to build a type library.  I

    I didn&#39;t have the knowledge to recognize which free fonts were original and
    which weren&#39;t.  So I went back and deleted the free fonts, except for a very
    few that I feel certain about.  <BR> <BR>I see nothing wrong with someone offering
    a free font if you purchase a font.  But I think that we should respect the artists

  body: If you are the designer of a font, why should you not be able to give it away
    free? I&#39;m glad someone mentioned Gentium, which is a great example. <BR> <BR>People
    in the past have drawn comparisons with music - no-one asks why we need music,
    so the argument goes, so why should we ask why we need new fonts. Likewise on
    font distribution, surely?  <BR> <BR>I dont think that too many people would hold
    with the argument that ALL music HAD to be charged for &#40;or not released or
    performed&#41;, so that those who are at the top of their profession should not
    feel somehow devalued, and I dont see why that analogy isn&#39;t fitting here.
    <BR> <BR>Type design isn&#39;t all about the money. Some people are designing
    fonts simply because they enjoy it and may want to share it with others. Others
    are learning &#40;this is where I am at&#41;. Others to provide an altruistic
    service to the wider community. And many people are trying to make their living
    from it.  <BR> <BR>All are surely acceptable, if not welcome?

    Instead, we want to educate our own fellow students first. There are 700 students
    who study with us, most of whom have no idea about type. Many of them probably
    just assume that it is automatically generated by the computer itself! <BR> <BR>We
    want to to show them what is interesting about type design, why some students
    at the school do it, and why stealing fonts is bad &#40;everyone knows that students
    steal typefaces&#41;. We would also like to say, &#34;hey, be carefull about free
    fonts.&#34; They might not be good. And using them might even prevent newer, better

    in the sense of trying to use legislation to change a person&#39;s value system.
    <BR> <BR>There is a distinction between someone&#39;s broad morality &#40;or value
    system&#41; and anti-social, or socially disruptive behavior, which is frequently
    justified on moral grounds, and which government is entrusted to legislate against.  <BR>
    <BR>A lot hinges around the issue of whether an &#34;immoral&#34; act has a victim.
    Governents are more likely to legislate against anti-social behavior when there
    is a clear victim. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s one thing to say that the government has
    no business telling people how to behave when their behavior only effects themselves,
    quite another to use this as an argument to excuse activity which harms others.

  body: Brian, to be honest, I was a little surprised they could pay attention to
    my lecture. I got them in front of a white board and drew a few Bodoni letters
    and a few Garamond-ish forms to discuss stroke axis. Then I told them that this
    comes from the cant of a chisel-tip pen, and historical movements, etc. I followed
    with a few points about stroke contrast. Then, I pointed out x-height and character
    width. I used this to demonstrate the far more subtle differences between Times
    and Garamond, now that they understood the terms. Then I said, imagine the number
    of characters on a single page in a book. Now multiply that by the number of pages.
    Now you see why such little differences are so important, etc., etc. <BR> <BR>With
    some dry-erase markers and about 10 minutes, I was able to communicate most of
    that info. However, I also had a willing and intelligent audience of one. <BR>
    <BR>I also got into kerning and kerning pairs, how many characters are actually
    in a font, and how many weights a truly versatile text font requires &#40;emphasizing
    that the bold is not just a computer extrapolation, but an actual unique design,
    etc.&#41;. But that was more aimed at demonstrating why font families can cost
    100s of dollars when you get them packaged with software that costs about as much
    as one font. That was probably an additional 10 minutes or so.
