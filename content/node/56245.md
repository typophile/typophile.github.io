body: "Hello fellow typophiles.\r\n\r\nI'd like to show my new release. It's a sans
  called Gesta.\r\n\r\nGesta is a friendly versatile sans serif typeface suitable
  for corporate and editorial purposes.\r\nWith its generous x-height and slightly
  curved strokes, Gesta combines a distinctive and warm feel with a modern look.\r\nIt
  is available in four weights from light to bold with four matching italics and its
  OpenType features include small caps and old style figures for every weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nit
  is available at MyFonts. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/r-type/gesta/\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  would also like to thank Typophile and the typophiles for your help.\r\nThis where
  I got help and great suggestions: http://typophile.com/node/53140\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarm
  Regards.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textSetGesta_5241.jpg]"

    some more weights. I also thought about an extra light or thin. But for now I'll
    let it rest :)"
