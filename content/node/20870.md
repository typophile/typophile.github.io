    fine art museum and almost next door to MassArt. They also have a great cafe,
    one of the better museum gift shops anywhere, and a beautiful courtyard. I'll

    August 10 - 2:30 - 4:30 pm-----------\r\n\r\nTour and Play at Firefly Press |
    FREE!\r\n\r\nVisit one of the finest letterpress printing offices operating today.
    Firefly Press, in operation since 1978, is an entirely letterpress operation,
    doing true letterpress only - printing directly from metal type that they set
    in-house. Firefly follows the philosophy, not just the mannerisms, of such Boston-area
    printers as D. B. Updike, Bruce Rogers, W.A. Dwiggins, and Rudolph\r\nRuzicka.
    Firefly projects include small books and brochures, broadsides and certificates,
    invitations, announcements, and stationery. They didn't set out to be a museum
    - it just happened that way. They print on a Vandercook proof press and a Chandler
    & Price Craftsman platen press, and have two\r\nLinotype machines, two Monotype
    composition casters and a Monotype\r\ndisplay type caster, and about 250 cases
    of type for hand setting. A typecaster will be operational for this visit, and
    attendees can print their own keepsake on the Vandercook!\r\n\r\nFirefly Press\r\n119

    are in the Darth Vader-esque Tower Building at MassArt, 621 Huntington, Boston.
    Instructions on taking the T from the Hyatt are on the TypeCon site and in the

    of stairs, and there will be TypeCon volunteers waiting to check you in and direct
    you to the workshops!\r\n\r\nSadly, no Type Radio folks will be in Boston, but
    they'll be at TypeCon next year (venue announcement happens Friday! I'll give
