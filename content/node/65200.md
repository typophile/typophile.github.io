  the typeface Century Old Style so strongly resembles the Old Style typeface designed
  by Alexander Phemister as to be almost an imitation (although, apparently, it does
  have one change: drastically shortened descenders) - while the version of Bookman
  with which I am most familiar, the one drawn by Ed Benguiat, also might take some
  inspiration from it, but still seems to me to be an entirely new typeface, for which
  Ed Benguiat should get all the blame - and the credit.\r\n\r\nYet, a Google search
  shows Phemister mentioned most often in connection with Bookman. This may just be
  because Bookman is vastly more popular than Century Old Style. though, and not because
  the link is stronger."

  body: "The two main 19th century styles of text face, Modern and Old Style (which
    ironically came later) are pretty generic.\r\nSo Century OId Style is what one
    would expect a modern face, Century, to look like, given an old-style treatment.\r\n\r\nMost
    interestingly, it creates a huge scale of page.\r\nCheck out the large size in
    the 1925 Linotype Manual to appreciate how tight it sets, both in horizontal fit
    and vertically (as you note), it blows avery other face in the manual out of the
    water.\r\n\r\nIt was well used for these qualities in the 1960s, 70s and 80s in
    advertising and brochures--making it far more popular, in my experience, than
    Bookman.\r\n\r\nI used Century Old Style quite a bit in the early 1990s as both
    a text and display face, but Bookman in its various manifestations always struck
    me as being too crudely fitted for nice typography. But perhaps people today are
    more appreciative, given the present interest in slab serif styles."

  body: 'Phemister''s Old Style for Miller & Richard became one of those iconic faces
    of its period as to be practically generic, and it spawned a number of imitations/inspired-bys.
    Century Oldstyle and Bookman Oldstyle are but two, evolving in slightly different
    directions. '

  body: "According to Mac McGrew's 'American Metal Type Faces of the 20th Century'
    Bookman Oldstyle is a result of thickening the strokes of the original Miller
    & Richard design. The contrast, in particular, is much reduced. The ATF version
    shown from 1906 looks pretty much like itself, including the popular swashes.
    The low contrast allows for those meaty swashes, which are the blessing or curse
    of many shop signs. \r\n\r\nThe descenders in the ATF version are even more squashed
    than later versions.  "

    Old Style and Old Style Antique were two different faces, and the latter one does
    resemble Bookman.'
