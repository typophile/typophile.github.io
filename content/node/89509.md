  they would have used in an invitation to a sorority dance  party in 1975. Thanks.

  body: "In a moment of self-doubt I started to question my suggestion of Park Avenue,
    since it didn't originate during the period. However a reassuring Google image
    search for \"invitation 1975\" (without quotes) turned up 3 instances of Park
    Avenue (or something like it) just on the first page! Phew.\r\n\r\nNot that sorority
    sisters wouldn't use something more contemporary...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R6dMSe8VI2c/TMsDY_FvOtI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/7l84HJbwSlo/s1600/wiz_invitation.jpg\">"

  body: Motter Femina was made in 1981, but the 70s didn't really end on time. If
    you want a really heavy-handed 70s stereotype, it fits.

    fonts appear to be renamed revivals that don\u2019t credit the original designer.\r\nAnd
    many were revivals already during the 1970s, e.g. those in the Art Deco style.\r\nPlease,
    take some time to do the thing right, and take it to the next level.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
