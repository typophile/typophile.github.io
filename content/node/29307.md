  match.\r\nI have no idea what the Furnishings Inc text is, but the Commercial..
  text seems to be Bodoni, but I can't seem to find the proper weight to match, so
  guess its something else.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

  body: Looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/empire/familytree.html">Empire</a>
    designed by Morris Fuller Benton. This particular sample looks like the freeware
    version called "Ultra Condensed Sans Serif".

    the N looked different. I found the freeware version. I just need to recreate
    the logo. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on the Commercial... text part?"
