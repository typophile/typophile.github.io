    closer inspection, I think Trajan is a more likely suspect/victim."

  body: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Titus&x=0&y=0">Titus</a> in a small
    caps version? Does that even exist?

  body: There's got to be another, bolder version of Titus. (<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/36530">Look
    here.</a>) Apparently with small caps...

  body: "The SC are faux, I think. As for the weight, we have talked before about
    creating 'bold' by adding stroke thickness to type. In Illustrator you can add
    it in any increment you want, like 0.1 pt, for example.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: There was, predigitally, a Medium weight of Titus. I know of no digital version,
    though.
