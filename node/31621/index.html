Any truth to this? Can't say I heard it before. What was John Warnock doing in Chicago in 1871 anyway?

		<div class="commentbody">IIRC Hermann Berthold updated the points/pica system to work with metric measurements in the late 19th century. But the British then got pissy about not being the ones who designed the measurements; they then created the current point/pica system. I believe that I read it in Megg's <em>History of Graphic Design</em>, but I don't have a copy at home so I can't look it up.

As for how the current system came to the US, it seems that the US would have been following whatever Europe was doing up to at least the early 1900s, because the US was importing much of its type from Europe. I guess that I'll have to ask the author for his sources so I can look this stuff up...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For my old codgerly mind, 12 points equal a pica; 6 picas kinda almost, but not quite equals an inch. That was the good old metal type days.  Along comes digital in the mid 80s and the software folks take over. Some guy named Warnock decides that this incredibaly small fraction between an inch and 6 picas isn't worth screwing with and just changes it in some wierd software thingy called PostScript and, DANG! There ya hav' t folks :-)

		<div class="commentbody"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_%28typography%29">Here</a> is probably more than you wanted to know about the evolution of the 'point'. James Mosley tells me the French inch was larger than the English inch, so the Didot and English points are different, and accroding to the article the Americans had a 'Printer's foot' that was less than a standard foot and then in 1886 ... 

Never mind :)  </div>

Sometimes I wonder if, had the French and English inches been the same, would the resultant lack of British jokes about Napoleon's height have preserved peace between the countries, leaving Napoleon free to dominate continental Europe? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, the official French foot was 12.7897 English inches. If you bring up ‘Typographic unit’ in Wikipedia, it has the whole story, pretty exactly (as it so often does). Especially if you follow up its reference to Sébastien Truchet and google a bit with his name. And I’m glad Adobe cleared up that messy definition of the US point. I could never remember how it went, and the English inch and mile and all that stuff feels more natural, somehow.</div>
