    usually has one or two <a href=\"http://cooperunion.augusoft.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=1011&CategoryID=2&SubCategoryID=19\">Continuing
    Education courses in type and calligraphy</a>. I see that this semester they have
    a letterpress course.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.centerforbookarts.org/\">The
    Center for Book Arts</a> is another place to check every now and then, even if
    typography is not their main interest."

  body: James, shoot me an e-mail if you're interested in getting work through temp
    agencies -- it probably won't be typeface design, but it'll help pay for those
    classes. :-)

    It starts on Tuesday Jan 27 and it runs through April. Hopefully it will be an
    ongoing thing.
