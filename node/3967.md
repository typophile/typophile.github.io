  design firm Mintchaos. <BR> <BR><b>Note:</b> I apologize for the links instead of
  embedded images. I couldn&#39;t get them to work. <BR> <BR>Figures one and two show
  the two variations I&#39;m working with. I started with #1 but my preference has
  been leaning towards #2. There are also small version of both to show how they read
  at very small sizes. <BR> <BR><a href="http://outbox.staging.mintchaos.com/logo/mc.1.logos.gif">
  Figures one and two</a> <BR> <BR>Figure three shows some colors: <BR> <BR><a href="http://outbox.staging.mintchaos.com/logo/mc.3.colors.gif">
  Figure 3 - color test</a> <BR> <BR>Figure 4 is a business card mockup &#40;There
  is also a <a href="http://outbox.staging.mintchaos.com/logo/mc.4b.bcard.gif"> version
  of the bcard using the logo from figure 2</a>: <BR> <BR><a href="http://outbox.staging.mintchaos.com/logo/mc.4.bcard.gif">
  Business card mockup</a> <BR> <BR>And now that you&#39;ve seen it, a bit about the
  Mintchaos and the logo.  <BR> <BR>Mintchaos is my personal design firm. Our main
  focus is web but we do some of everything. The short version of my web-design philosophy
  is that everything should be done in the cleanest and most technologically &#34;correct&#34;
  way I can. This includes adherence to web-standards, accessibility, future-proofing,
  etc. while at the same producing visually appealing solutions that lack needless
  complexity. I probably sound like a pompous &#149;&#149;&#149; saying it. but that&#39;s
  what I do. <BR> <BR>The logo is only made up of only one primary triangle, the one
  used for the wings. The shapes in the middle are made from the triangle. The triangle
  it self is a golden triangle. And the shapes in the middle are <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PenroseTiles.html">Penrose
  Tiles</a> &#40;these tiles can cover an infinite space and never create a repeating
  pattern&#41;.  There are only two edge lengths used in the entire logo, and they
  are the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=the%2Bgolden%2Bratio">golden
  ratio</a>. Mathematically speaking the longer length is 1 &#43;  &#216; long and
  the shorter length is 1 &#43; 1/&#216; long. &#40;Not exactly the correct symbol
  for phi, but this forum eats HTML entities.&#41; <BR> <BR>The goal of the logo was
  to create a simple and recognizable mark that betrayed the complex exactness that
  it is built on. Which is what I try to do. <BR> <BR>That said, have at it!  And
  thank you in advance for your thoughts!'

    I was 8, maybe its an idea for Mint Chaos? to look into. Sorry for butchering

  body: The first impulse in perceiving the word is to see &#34;tch&#34; as a common
    letter grouping, and so surmise that the word is pronounced &#34;Minch-ouse&#34;
    and might be someone&#39;s last name. One has to examine it for a few seconds
    before saying, &#34;Ohhh, it&#39;s mint-chaos.&#34; <BR> <BR>Perhaps if &#34;mint&#34;
    were in smallcaps, and &#34;chaos&#34; in lowercase? But I&#39;m not sure if that
    would work, since &#34;c&#34; wouldn&#39;t really distinguish itself as one or
    the other.

    sounds like a pretty tight equation.   <BR> <BR>Is there anything chaotic about
    it or is it simply an interesting name you&#39;ll use to attract.  <BR> <BR>The

    generation so I just don&#39;t get it. For that reason I won&#39;t comment except
    to advise you never to letterspace lower case. I know it&#39;s trendy but so are
    four-letter words in Hollywood.

  body: 'Tanya: I would say that the chaos part is all about the inspiration. Pulling
    all the random pieces together and &#39;mint&#39;ing them into something well
    defined. Also it ties in with the use of penrose tiles&#40;unrepeatable patterns&#41;,
    and golden ratio &#40;an irrational number&#41;. <BR> <BR>Pronunciation: It is
    pronounced mint-chaos. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have a problem with people getting
    it. I&#39;ve been operating under the name for a few years. <BR> <BR>Paul: Thank
    you for your comments, and yes, this mark has been harder for me than anything
    else I&#39;ve worked on. I&#39;ve revised it to not be tracked so loosely. I&#39;m
    pretty sure I can see the value, but if anyone can explain &#40;or point me to
    some information&#41; about why, from a typographical standpoint this is unwise
    I&#39;d love to hear it. Typography is one of my weaker design areas and is something
    I&#39;m trying to learn more about.  <BR> <BR>Here are the new, and probably final
    versions. I&#39;ve decided to go with the original &#40;fig 1 above&#41; design&#41;.
    I think it&#39;s stronger and more focused. And as a friend said &#34;#1 looks
    like an &#39;M&#39; but #2 looks like <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/vcr_pp.html">
    Pom Pom</a>. I have toned down the &#39;g&#39; in design a bit as Andrew suggested.
    <BR> <BR>The colors are still up in the air somewhat. Except for that green, I
    really like that. <BR> <BR>I want to print the ghosted repeating line that is
    behind the logo in the business card as a spot varnish, not as an actual inked
    color/value. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your input! And if you have any more thoughts
    I&#39;d love to hear them. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32205.gif"

    the mark, I can live with the &#39;mintchaos&#39;, but that g throws it all. <BR>More
    so in the stacked verticaly alighed version, than the horz version. I think you
    could get away with it there. it seems like you have all this symetry going on,
    and this little g sticks his foot in the door. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I&#39;m repeating myself, but if you&#39;re emphasising chaos as a theme,
    you might want to create something consistent with the rules of a true Penrose
    tiling. That is to say, if you fit the two shapes together to make a diamond,
    you&#39;ve defeated the purpose.

    your concept and name, though I must admit because &#34;mintchaos&#34; is one
    word, it can have a tendency not to resonate clearly upon initial glancing...
    <BR> <BR>As for the altered &#34;g&#34;: I think the reason why some people have
    a problem with it, is because it sticks out and seems to aggravate a seemingly
    cohesive and symmetrical design...perhaps this can be remedied by having the logo
    graphic be unsymmetrical in some way.  If some other part or section between the
    graphic and the typography were not so balanced, the altered g would not cause
    such a stir...this is what I see in my mind&#39;s eye, so forgive me if reality
    proves this advice otherwise...but I do feel you are very close to having this
    solution finalized.'

  body: 'First off, thanks to all of you for your comments, they have been quite helpful.   <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m working on some new versions of the type that I should have ready
    to post tomorrow sometime. Trying to visually break up mint and chaos to increase
    recognition, without hurting the flow of the design.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying
    some versions that don&#39;t have &#39;design&#39; in them at all. Because that
    is not all I do, and because it will make the logo more versatile. I am not pleased
    at all with how the above version looks horizontally.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also trying
    some other fonts, although I really like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/target/">
    Target</a>. I keep coming back to it. I&#39;ll show you were all of that is going
    tomorrow. <BR> <BR>As far as the symbol goes, I&#39;m in love with it, and doubt
    it will change. I think it will serve me well over time. Everyone seems to see
    different things in it: Darth Vader,  origami, a rocketship, a kite, a KKK mask,
    a nun. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Daniel: I really like this color of green. And while it isn&#39;t
    &#39;mint&#39; in the artificial sense of the word it isn&#39;t all that far off
    from the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shamanactivity/amazon4.html"> real
    thing</a>. <BR> <BR>Scott: I took the shading out of the symbol to purify the
    internal shapes. I&#39;m still undecided over which one I like better. I think
    both styles work well.'

    I think you should go with the &#34;artificial&#34; one insted. This one is not
    &#34;fresh&#34; enough for me, too yelow... :-&#41; <BR> <BR>One last thing, the
