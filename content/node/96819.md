body: "I am a novice font designer and want to design non latin fonts at some point
  or the other. I was wondering if you guys who design Arabic typefaces actually speak/understand
  Arabic( stupid question?). To put it in a better way, should I learn Arabic to typeset
  it? I did try searching this forum but i can not go back to previous discussion
  pages(forum is broken? The links are not loading). \r\nIf it's still not clear ,
  i am talking about John Hudson(http://typophile.com/user/1262)"

  body: "I have nativity in three scripts (including Arabic) and can read five languages;
    I've made fonts both for scripts I can read languages in and scripts I can't,
    and I've come to believe that you don't need nativity in a script (which practically
    has very little to do with spoken language) to make acceptable fonts (although
    you certainly do need nativity to <em>innovate</em> in a script). The central
    things are observation and thought. However as a rule it take many years to accumulate
    enough of those two things to get quality results.\r\n\r\nBTW don't conflate \"type
    design\" with \"typesetting\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
