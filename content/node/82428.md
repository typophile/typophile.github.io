body: "I have designed an invitation for the celebration of my daughter's bat mitzvah.
  To match the grey / x-height / etc. between the Hebrew and the English, I went through
  a few iterations.\r\n\r\nInitially, I was using a script face for both languages;
  however, I wasn't too happy with the English, so I changed everything but the name(s).
  Once I spaced the two sides, the Hebrew ended at 9.5/18 and the English at 11.5/18.\r\n\r\nInitial
  typefaces were Fontbit Egotrip (Hebrew) and Sudtipos Adios Script (English). Those
  are still the faces of the names. The rest of the text is now Fontbit Hadasa New
  and Mrs. Eaves.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the height of the Hebrew? OK? Too small?
  I haven't gone through the text to make sure kerning is correct, but I'm happy to
  take suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe sample is attached.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "Maybe make it slightly larger - but not much.\r\n\r\nOther things:\r\n- The
    gaps above and below the scripty names seem imbalanced.\r\n- The contrast between
    the Hebrew and Latin scripts is very large, and notably it's much stronger than
    the contrast between the Hebrew and Latin fonts.\r\n- Mrs Eaves is very poorly
    spaced; I would go through it all with a fine hair comb.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "First let's start with the Hebrew body text:\r\n1. you could actually make
    it a little smaller if you like.\r\n2. you could add a bit more letter space (not
    word space).\r\nNow for the English body text.\r\n1. the kerning is a bit rubbish.\r\n2.
    I would tighten the tracking.\r\n\r\nthe script names look great. Don't touch
    them!\r\n\r\nEveryone makes (imo) the mistake of trying to match Hebrew and English.
    Forget it. They are two different languages built differently. Try to get the
    English to compliment the Hebrew. They don't have to be the same colour. Think
    of it as trying to put to shapes next to each other which are not the same size.
    They don't have to be the same colour to look nice. You can have a dark grey shape
    next to a light grey shape and they will look lovely. But if you try and have
    two greys that are nearly the same, then it becomes very difficult.\r\n\r\nThat's
    my two cents worth (with British spelling :-) )"

    Forget it.\r\n\r\nIt's true that too often there's too much formal congruence
    imposed across scripts. But just like with anything else, you can't simply ignore
    that two things are sharing a space. For example, if you made the English text
    small and lighter, you would make your non-Jewish guests feel inferior.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think that the Latin-alphabet script typeface is legible, and does not
    need to be replaced. I can't really comment on the legibility of the Hebrew one,
    but it doesn't appear to be likely to be unreadable.\r\n\r\nFor a formal invitation,
    it is reasonable to use a Roman typeface with a small x-height. But doing so is
    what has created the problem with the invitation; the Hebrew takes up a small
    proportion of the space, and yet it already looks visually larger than the Roman.\r\n\r\nSince
    using a typeface with a large x-height for the Roman would simply be inappropriate,
    I think that one has to simply live with this contradiction. Thus, while I would
    suggest increasing the size of the Hebrew text from what it is in the example,
    I would suggest only a very slight increase, so that the line widths of the Hebrew
    text remain somewhat smaller than those of the English text."
