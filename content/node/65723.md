body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working on getting a font ready, and I'm having a problem
  with pdf embedding. Here's the summary: I design my fonts in TypeTool, then use
  FontForge to make .otf files. But, when I use these otf files to make a pdf with
  Word 2007 (currently the only pdf-making program I have that can deal with otf's,
  since OpenOffice can't), my fonts show up pixelated. Other fonts don't. I've tried
  fiddling with the options in the otf generation dialog in FontForge, but I can't
  seem to get rid of the pixelation. Does anyone know what could cause this?\r\n\r\nHere's
  a pdf of the problem, with the first six words being in my font family. You have
  to zoom in a bit to see the pixelation. If it'll help, I could send you a copy of
  the font for a look.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\nNathanael"

  body: The bottom sample doesn't pixelate. Is there anything different with that
    one?

  body: "The fonts in the bottom sample, i.e. Bell MT and Times roman italic, are
    embedded. The previous fonts are not as you can see with Acrobat reader when you
    select \"Document properties\" \"fonts\".\r\n\r\nI have never had that problem
    on a mac. Maybe one thing to check is the embedding rights. In Fontforge, with
    \"Elements\" > \"Font info\" > \"OS/2\" > \"Misc\" > \"Embeddable\", you can fix
    those rights.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've got that set to "Editable Document", and both of the boxes (No Subsetting
    and Only Embed Bitmaps) are unchecked. I've also tried with "Printable Document"
    and gotten pixelation. I think I've tried it with "Installable Font" too and gotten
    pixelation, although it was a while ago. The other two I just tried again today.
    Someone else is on the computer now, so I can't try the third again, but I don't
    think it worked.

  body: Your settings for embedding look just fine yet your font is not embedded as
    you can see by trying to select a character in the pdf; what is selected is an
    image, most of the time of a full word.

  body: I've been told that the computer where I used Word has some other software
    on it that may have confused the computer. I got a PDF to export okay with PDF995,
    but I'm still not convinced my font is entirely usable. I suppose I'll check back
    if I figure out more, but if anyone has possible other answers, I'm still open
    to those.
