  have this features:\r\n\r\n<ol> <li>supports all of languages using Arabic script
  (unicode range 0600-06FF and 0750-077F).</li>\r\n<li>Have 5553 kerning pairs.</li>
  </ol>\r\n\r\nAs an experienced designer, what's your opinion about my first typeface?
  it's based on XB Niloofar and Zar fonts. Some glyphs are scanned from printed papers
  of 1998 year, I could not find the original Zar font. (see attached pdf.)"

    with Arabic, I\u2019d love to see this up close. I find the Arabic script in itself
    beautiful and facinating."

    of view, so please take them with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThese spots, and a few
    others, are places where your strokes seem to form heavy black spots. Is this
    intended?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bilde2_5948.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bilde3_4117.png]"

  body: "I see you. Last one is a bug: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/69087\">(look
    at here)</a>\r\n\r\nBut about other heavy black spots: One of the most common
    paradigms in Arabic Calligraphy and type-design is making heavy marked text to
    seem Mono-Weight --> so from a far enough distance, the whole text should look
    like a silhouette gray illusion (see below images). (I think kerning of Latin
    fonts is based on the same idea.)\r\n\r\nhttp://29letters.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/arabic-letterforms.jpg\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v4maAoBsN18/SdSrLqguRdI/AAAAAAAAAKg/VWPi962_1ks/s320/thuluth.gif\r\nhttp://www.islamicity.com/mosque/ihame/aw62d.gif\r\n\r\nIn
    order to simulate this behavior, i write an algorithm to decide about mark positioning
    and kerning pairs. but in some situation there is no way (that I'm aware of) to
    make the text mono-weighted, because of the nature of glyphs: in general they
    should be written by the Qalam (try to find Qalam's path on nowadays fonts):\r\n\r\nhttp://de.academic.ru/pictures/dewiki/108/learning_arabic_calligraphy.jpg\r\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3473/3257108503_f87b226321.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    try to design the font with same look --> it seems to be a little inconvenience!
    but I'll try to solve the problem ...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n"

    be aware that a monolinear sans need lots of subtle optical corrections. For example,
    the eye of a binocular \u201Cg\u201D almost always needs to be mathematically
    lighter to match the weight of the other letters. Likewise, joints, like where
    the curved part of \u201Cb\u201D hits the stem or the two diagonals in \u201Cv\u201D
    meet will often look to heavy, even if their weight is correct. "

  body: "Soroush,\r\nI suppose this detail in medial heh is of calligraphic origin,
    but it looks like metal type artefact. Also la looks weird. Do you plan to add
    ligatures?\r\n\r\nFrode,\r\nwe've got used to a system where all letters try to
    have the same level of gray. In latin it would disturb, but in Arabic, black dots
    of final meem and medial ain may improve readability."

    stage I introduced some shape changes which solve few small problems. For example
    my medial heh has only the upper loop, so the sin-heh- pair looks ligated. But
    that's all. Nothing more I could do without ligatures). "

  body: "The first impression when seeing the pdf samples (apart from the kashida
    problems and some clashes of marks with letters) is very positive.  The letter-shapes,
    proportions, details and sizes are very pleasant to look at.  I specially like
    the large harakat marks, thin verticals and elegent stroke taperings.  Purists
    might object to this or that point insofar as the letters might adhere to any
    given calligraphic tradition, but considered as a font everything in it works
    beautifully together. For some reason it reminds me of light hand-set text fonts
    used in the Palestinian newspapers \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064A\u0646  and  \u0627\u0644\u062F\u0641\u0627\u0639
    printed around 1950.\r\n\r\nBecause it is a font with a limited number of ligatures,
    perhaps it is better not to have the initial 'ain (illustrated by frode in \u0639\u0647\u062F\u062A\u0645
    above) start too high and slope down as it does. It looks a bit odd compared to
    the overwhelmingly horizontal spine of the other letters.  And as I have long
    advocated in Arabic font design:  make the dots (not the marks which are large
    enough here) larger for the sake of legibility. I know it is not traditional to
    do so, but on a screen and in small print sizes the dots tend to disappear and
    they carry very important information about which letter one is reading! Examples:
    \u062C \u062D \u062E   \u0628 \u062A \u062B   etc."
