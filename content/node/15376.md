  body: From what I can make out on the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/" target="new">website</a>
    the logo looks like it's set in [[Matthew Carter]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=ITC.119127.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=The+New+York+Public+Library&sampleSize=24"
    target="new">ITC Galliard</a>. Can you post a scan or direct us to an online PDF
    that displays the typeface you're referring to?

  body: "I got some information on the NYPL's brand identity from their Communications
    and Marketing Deptartment and they said, \"Galliard Bold and BoldItalic are used
    for extreme emphasis, and should only be used on documents such as report covers,
    presentation materials etc. They are not to be used in the letterhead nor when
    creating our logotype.  Otherwise the font Library, in Italic, Romand and Smcaps
    is used for the NYPL name\".  \r\n\r\nI can not find any examples because I am
    not sure what Library looks like, who designed, etc...which is the info I was
    hoping someone knew."

  body: The name "Library" indicates this could very well be a custom proprietary
    typeface.
