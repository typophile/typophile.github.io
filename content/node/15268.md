  and would like to try out Gmail, but I don't know anybody who has an account, and
  it's an invitation only sorta thing.\r\n\r\nSo \u2014 if any kind person out there
  has a Gmail, and would like to send me an invite, I'd really really appreciate it!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n[since
  spymac rarely works I can be contacted at chadpbrewer(at)hotmail.com]\r\n"

      of. Let me knkow if someone wants one. Anyone know of a place where I can donate
      them? I know they were doing that for some time for US soldiers.

  body: "Maximum attachment size could range from around 6 mb - 10 mb, depending on
    what type of attachment it is (total message size including encodes cannot exceed
    10 mb). I believe that goes for both upstream and downstream.\r\n\r\nAnything
    larger would take forever for the recipient to receive anyway, especially if they
    are on a slower connection. \r\n\r\nAlso a very generous 2,500 megabytes (2,5
    gig)of total storage space.  When Gmail first rolled around, it had a then-unheard-of
    one gigabyte storage allotment, five hundred times (!) more than Hotmail had at
    the time (Hotmail later increased that limit to remain competitive.. but so did
    Google!). \r\n\r\nFrom the official FAQ regarding spam:\r\n\r\n\"We are committed
    to keeping unwanted messages out of your inbox. Gmail includes a sophisticated
    spam filter that we're continuing to improve. The Report Spam button in Gmail
    is a way for users to help with this effort. It removes spam from the inbox and
    sends valuable data to the Gmail team working on spam blocking.\"\r\n\r\nNot sure
    what that translates to in practice, but considering their keen attention to detail
    and service, I'm sure they are probably at the top of the game regarding spam
    prevention. Of course much spam can be attributed to users simply not exercising
    proper e-mail care and leaving it in the wrong places online, thus making it vulnerable
    to be indexed by web-crawling spam bots.\r\n\r\nPersonally I've had my Gmail account
    for well over a year and had 0 spam messages that I cannot attribute to my own
    carelessnes (I get periodical e-mails that I consider spam from a forum I signed
    up for a few years ago and unfortunately their unsubscribe address isn't working).
    \r\n\r\nI do not usually adopt the role of being an unwitting viral marketing
    vector for companies, but I'll make an exception for Gmail since it's served me
    so well. If anyone  needs an invite, give me a shout--I also have 100 available.
    :-P\r\n\r\nThey actually seem to refresh after a while, I gave a bunch away already
    but it's back at 100. Clever to keep the invites going even as a mere formality,
    because it keeps people talking about it. I have seen many topics like this one
    on various forums."
