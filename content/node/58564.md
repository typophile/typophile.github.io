body: Hey there, am I crazy or is there no numero glyph in the AvantGarde Bold world?
  I don't see it in the (OT) Pro or Alternates according to ITC online charsets, and
  I only have web access through my phone at the moment, or I could do the footwork
  myself. I can't believe it's not there, hell, there are three alternates for ordinal
  numerals, there has to be a simple numero! (I hope... If not it's going to be fun
  building one with no software over lunch)
