  be a title/display font, these are the very first sketches. So far I think it is
  promising. What do you think about it?\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have some Q&Q. Thank
  you in advance.\r\n\r\nP.S.: working title is Pontifex, but I've found a font family
  named Poppl-Pontifex. I'm not sure if I should change the name. Should I?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pontifex_test_012_3575.jpg]"

    some times ago.\r\n\r\nI wanted to do that fat sans into an alphabet but in the
    middle of the process the idea come - adding this unusal terminals. I liked it
    and kept it.\r\n\r\nThat's the story so far."
