  a copywriter, not a professional) cannot remember having ever seen a ligature for
  ff\xE8 -- which could be put to use in making a nice Italian caff\xE8. Can anyone
  point me out to instances of this ligature (or other ligatures of an f followed
  by a letter with a grave accent)? Or is it inexistent? And if so, why would that
  be?\r\nThanks, Bart"

    an alternate |f| with shorter overhanging."

      I do not know my way around yet. Could you tell me where those earlier threads
      are to be found?\r\nI can see how an f with shortened terminal will leave room
      for the accent on a following \xE8 -- but why would one rather not have a ligature
      like the common fi-ligature? At least such a glyph would be less outlandish
      than this f\xF3 ligature...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f-o-accent-aigu_6392.jpg]\r\n(found
      on P\xE9ter M\xF3lnars Flickr-pages)\r\nAre there other examples? I would love
      to see them.\r\nThanks, Bart"

  body: The dot of an i is (with the exception of Turkish and Azerbaijani) not an
    accent and does not impart extra information, so it can be subsumed by the f without
    causing confusion. You want to be sure of whether you're looking at an accent
    or an unusual serif, because it changes what you read.
