  body: "Are you saying it's known that the sample dates from the 20's or 30's ...
    or just that it looks that way to you?\r\n\r\nThe closest that comes to mind is
    Florentine Bold (predigitally). Today's digital, commercial version of <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/florentine/'
    target='_blank'>Florentine</a> does not include the bold. Opti offered the bold,
    but they are long out of business - and were of shady reputation anyway.\r\n\r\nOddly
    enough, the Solotype Catalog's brief showing of Florentine Bold (probably phototype)
    includes an 'A' much like yours - something I've not seen in any other showing
    of the typeface."

    most famous is the poster lettering for Fritz Lang's Metropolis [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MetropolisLang_5327.jpg]
    I have not found any matches for your lettering. I was able to find a serif font
    with tapered strokes, but it has a whimsical and informal flavor rather than the
    formal thick and thin structure of _ACAPULCO_. Here is  Phil Bracco's Spidertoes

  body: 'Thanks everyone! I didn''t have an exact date. I was guessing based on the
    piece of collateral I cut it from which was sort of deco. Looks like an exact
    match is tough and it is an obscure cut. Florentine is the closest yet. '
