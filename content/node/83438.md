  font in the above photo based on a Latin original?\r\nIt sure looks familiar...
  To me it has a late 90s FontFont feel.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "There's a whole lot of similarities (ie the strict monoline roundedness,
    the slightly awkward geoetricity) to typefaces based on Leroy mechanical lettering
    machines or carbide engraving machines, stuff like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/din_17_sb_regular/|DIN
    17]] or [[http://www.optimo.ch/typefaces_Gravostyle-Basic.html|Gravostyle]] or
    [[http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/|Gravur]].\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure there are ones that are even closer though - I can't quite remember which
    one, but I swear I've seen \"gravure-style\" fonts that have an /n/ that looks
    even more similar to the armeninan /\u0578/ in that picture."

  body: "You're making me think that maybe it's not a font, that it was cut from a
    \"moving skeleton\" (typical in machines that cut shapes in materials like metal
    or wood). However there are some typographic details, like the curl-back in the
    \"\u0575\", which is a spacing trick (like one sees in the Latin \"j\" sometimes).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I still think its a digital font based on moving skeleton lettering, if nothing
    else because the Arabic underneath is clearly not created by that method.
