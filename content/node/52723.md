  body: I don't know about the MacBook or the 2.4 GHZ iMac; I have a recent 2.66 GHz
    20" iMac and the screen display is not good. The colour fades from top to bottom.
    My local dealer put in a new screen and it was just as bad; Apple replaced the
    computer; still the same problem. I've learned to live with it. Check carefully
    before you buy!

    and I have never been happier. The portability is great to have, allowing me to
    meet with clients at Starbucks or B&N (since we have an AT&T Internet account
    at home, the Internet access is free). I have a spare 24\" WideScreen I use as
    as extra monitor too. Once I moved from a single to double monitors at my last
    job, I have a difficult time going back to a single screen.\r\n\r\nIf you need
    the portability, the choice is obvious. If not and you will always be working
    from the same office, I might go with the iMac (and still use the second monitor
    ... heeheh).\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nWynne Hunkler\r\nPrincipal | <a href=\"http://www.wynnefields.com/\">Wynnefields

  body: "If absolute performance isn't a factor then go for the laptop: portability's
    a huge boon. \r\n\r\nDepending on how good your current monitor is, if your budget'll
    stretch to a large high-quality external display to go with the laptop then do
    that, too (and a nice aluminium Apple keyboard while you're at it). I went for
    a 27\" Dell 2709W wide-gamut monitor, as I work with photographs frequently and
    it fit my price-performance criteria, but if colour accuracy's critical then consider
    an S-IPS panel or similar (which will be considerably more expensive).\r\n\r\nGiven
    a choice, I'd prefer a MacBook + monitor combo to just a MacBook Pro, due to the
    huge screen 'real estate' when the MB's hooked up, but I'll concede that the non-aluminium
    MacBook's display panel is downright awful \u2013 hopefully the al MacBook's a
    bit better in this respect. So if you're planning on using it as a straight laptop
    for most of the time, it may be worth spending the extra on the Pro.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Oh, forgot to add, buy as much memory for it as possible from Crucial, OCZ or
    similar (it's too expensive from Apple). You'll need to get a 'Santa Rosa' MacBook
    (2.2GHz) to take advantage of 4GB as the older MacBooks only recognise 3GB of
    it, so watch out for that. This'll make a big difference if you work with the
    Adobe apps frequently, they'll take as much memory as they can get!"

    the 17 inch pro seems a bit limited) ... When things heat up i prefer to hook
    it up to a larger monitor or an HD Display because of the very limited screen
    real estate (it gets pretty hectic when using multiple apps like illustrator and
    photoshop along with indesign for example).\r\n\r\nApple makes a $20 mini-DVI
    to whatever connector for the Macbook (it's the only v-out port on the Macbook),
    i got three variations of that connector for my work, movie time, and audio, and

  body: I bought a new MacBook Pro (mainly for the bigger screen) a few weeks ago
    and I use it together with a second (23" ACD) display. Portability is important
    to me and this setup also allows me to work on 2 screens. The laptop screen for
    glyph editing and the larger screen for some metrics windows. The glossy screen
    is great. Better than the matte MBP I had before this.

    the things that scare me about the new models are the keyboard and the screen.
    So, you don't pick up reflections of things behind you? What's your opinion of
    the keyboard?"

    that much. And in bad lighting conditions also don't affect the glossy screen
    as much. Or when there is a light behind you reflecting in the screen; with the
    glossy it's just that but for the rest the screen stays normal, with the matte
    screens the light reflection becomes a large bloom-like effect, making your screen
    pretty much unusable.\r\n\r\nPlus; the colors and contrast are / look much more
    vibrant with the glossy screens.\r\n\r\nOn the keyboard.... not noticably different,
    they are basically just the same, only the way the case sits around them is different."
