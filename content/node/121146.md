  body: "At the time this was lettering. \r\nIn 2007 Paul Barnes designed an art deco
    titling typeface based on this style of lettering, called Empire State Building,
    for exclusive use by the Empire State Building. \r\n---start quote---\r\nThe original
    lettering carved into the stone of the exterior and applied to the mosaics in
    the lobby were the most obvious starting point, but they lacked a lowercase and
    were a bit 'too much' for general use in signage. However, several advertising
    types from the late 1920s and early 1930s surely influenced or were influenced
    by this popular style of lettering. Morris Fuller Benton's Louvaine and Dynamic,
    released by American Type Founders in Jersey City in 1928 and 1930, and Ultra
    Modern, released in 1928 by the Ludlow Foundry in New York, each provided convincing
    examples of what an appropriate lowercase might look like, and pointed to what
    a simpler companion style for more informational signage might look like.\r\n---end
