  Niemeyer buildings in Brasilia. It takes modernism | bauhaus in a new direction.\r\nI
  know some things are not right yet, I somehow think I know which but I certainly
  don't know how to fix that. Help! Please! The following link is to a large image\r\n[[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2494/4137562760_8cc073a3b9_o.jpg]][img:sites/default/files/old-images/brasilialphabet_4439.jpg]"

    a take on the banning of upper-case by some bauhaus theoricians.\r\n"

  body: My mind is slow tonight. I should have said that I have to play around a bit
    more with the weight of the upper case. It has to be markedly darker, narrower
    and with a larger x-height with a smaller stem height. Still, I can probably lighten
    it up a bit...

    that name is taken. A typeface called <a href=\"http://www.typogabor.com/hollenstein/pages/25-hollenstein.html\">Brasilia</a>
    was designed by Albert Hollenstein and Albert Boton in 1960. It is now available
    from a number of distributors\u2014as part of the Monotype\u2019s <em>Creative
    Alliance</em> font library\u2014under the name of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/pl_brazilia_vp/\">Brazilia</a>.
    Apparently, the design of Brasilia/Brazilia was inspired by the architecture of
    the new capital city of Brazil, which was the hottest thing going, in 1960."

  body: "This shows more promise than I would have expected (since I'm not a fan of
    this style). But what I would do is make it more display, and more interesting,
    by: dumping the current lc; making the current UC the lc; and making caps -maybe
    that only reach the x-height- with mostly traditional structures. I think then
    the results might even be nicely saleable.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
