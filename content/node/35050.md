body: I am trying to locate a good Illustrator tutorial on drawing tapered curves
  and swashes that someone mentioned a few months ago. This was the one that explained
  how to get really gorgeous and complicated tapers, not just generating generic ornaments
  with brushes. Searching is not bringing up the post, does anyone remember it?
