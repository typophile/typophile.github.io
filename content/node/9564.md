  body: I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;re going to find a commercial font that would
    share more than possibly one or two vaguely similar characters to your sample.
    It&#39;s from 1909 &#40;but I bet you know that because you scanned it from Smoke
    Gets in Your Eyes, didn&#39;t you?&#41; and definitely created by hand.
