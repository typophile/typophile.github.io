  body: It looks like you changed the UPM value in the FontInfo dialogue. Check the
    'Metrics and Dimensions' pane in FontInfo. The problem as it shows suggests that
    you reduced the UPM size with the 'Scale all glyphs...' option <strong>not</strong>
    set.

  body: "Hej Christian,\r\n\r\ndon't worry, your glyphs aren't messed up. You just
    scaled the preview in the font window.\r\n\r\nMake a new global guideline in the
    glyph window, a bit below your descender value, then right-click on it and choose
    \"Guideline is -> Visual Descender\" and it should be fine again."
