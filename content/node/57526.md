  drawn capitals (\"The IKEA PS Design Neverending Story\") before I start searching
  myself? It <em>does</em> look vaguely familiar. Oh, and it is a font -- identical
  characters look identical; they've just been scaled.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ikea-poster_6028.jpg]"

  body: "Are you sure this is a font Yves? Those E arms don't all meet the stems the
    same way. I think they repeated \"STORY\", but other places the letters seem to
    vary. I searched Part 12 and 14 of the Script Guide, and didn't find a match,
    but some of the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-childs-play/|FF Child's
    Play]] fonts were similar. Stuart's Spaghetti Western (FontDiner)had similar shapes,
    but with serifs.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Boys]] are fairly similar too, but I still think this might be custom/hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n-

  body: The one I posted is not a font, btw. It's just a lot of vectors packed in
    a zip. Quite a bit of alternates in there as well.
