  body: I have never had luck with that before with script fonts, especially at whatthefont.
    I guess it was my break points or luck of the draw. I will use due diligence next
    time before posting. Thank you for the find!

  body: script fonts are harder. and sometimes with things like this sample you have
    to guess at removing the outline or not. my first try included the width of the
    outline. second time i removed it. as for breaking the connections, i usually
    leave the tails to the right, and cut clean on the left of the glyph. like it
    would be if you typed it alone. sometimes you can see where the connection is
    and break it there.
