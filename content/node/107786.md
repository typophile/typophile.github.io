  a 1946 volume. It looks a little like [[http://www.linotype.com/86761/AmericanaStdRoman-product.html|Americana
  Std]], but the G, for instance, is different.\r\n\r\nThomas"

  body: The font is Latin Antique, shown in Inland 1907 and later in BB&S. DeVroye
    also has a page on his site from Inland showing the name as Poster Latin Antique
    but I don't know the date of his source. McGrew says Stephenson Blake also had
    a version available in the 50s/60s. A quick search did not turn up a digital version.

  body: "Thanks George for spotting the Inland source.\r\nJaspert's _Type Encylopaedia
    (1970) shows Latin Antique from Monotype but the letters are narrower. It also
    mentions Stephenson Blake as a producer of the font.\r\nSo the1946 publication
    could well have used the BB&S type inherited from Inland.\r\nLatin Antique was
    in the 1897 and 1907 Inland catalog. Poster Latin Antique disappeared between
    the 1897 and 1907 catalog. I can't see much difference:\r\nHere is Poster Latin
    Antique:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PosterLatinAntique24ptInland1897_4472.jpg]\r\nHere
    is Latin Antique:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LatinAntique24ptInland1897_4048.jpg]\r\nI
    agree that there is no digital version of the Inland design.\r\nDon"
