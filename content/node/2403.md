  body: 'Goran, sorry that was my idea of a bad joke. The Yankee owner is George Steinbrenner
    and he just buys championships by spending Grotesk amounts of money. His team
    this coming year will have salaries totaling over 180 million dollars and he doesn&#39;t
    care. The Brewers in the National league have a 30 million dollar budget for its
    players. '

  body: Goran, the best solution is your handlettering. The history of the Yankees
    is interesting, did you know about the curse of the Babe?
