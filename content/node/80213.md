  font by Monday and the person who designed, and original vector files, are MIA.
  I've searched everywhere for a similar font and could only find \"Spring\" \"Amorinda\"
  \"Indy Italic\" and \"Mr Dafoe\" but they aren't quite right. Very distinctive swashes
  on the lower-case letters...\r\nI attached the image with the words \"Cook-Off\"
  below...\r\n\r\nThank you so much!"
