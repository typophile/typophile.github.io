  logo, originally designed by Frank Miller's brother. This could be a fan font, but
  I hope it's a quality design. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lucky-luke_unknown_5059.jpg]"

  body: D'oh. Could've found that one myself. Unlinkable though, as its design is
    ripped off; not original. :^/

    favourite comics as a kid. My Dad had a bunch in French that he used to read/translate
    for me, and when I started to learn French in High School, I''d try to read them
    myself, and watch how I got better over time. '

    2009 in the US</a>, but no news on the Australian front.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think
    the best comics for learning French are <a href=\"http://www.asterix.com/index.html.en\">Asterix
    et Obelix</a>, because the writing is (was) so incredibly clever and funny."

  body: "Certainly agree with you there, Yves, and my Dad had a bunch of those in
    French as well. He lived in France for a few years before I was born and built
    up quite a collection of Asterix comics. Tintin too. And yes, I can't believe
    how well they were translated into English. The names \u2013 Getafix, Unhygenix,
    Fulliautomatix, Vitalstatistix, etc, etc \u2013 are particularly memorable.\r\n\r\nRiccardo,
    so they have. The TV show was shown here in Australia many years ago (I remember
    the theme: Bang, bang a Luke-y Luke!), but I've never heard of any of the films."
