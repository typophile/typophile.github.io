body: So Bruce Rogers creates what is widely acknowledged to be the finest interpretation
  of Jenson&#39;s Roman ever made, and the patterns are lost? I don&#39;t even know
  what a pattern is, but I have this mental image of someone at a yard sale buying
  something whose worth and use they could never fathom. <BR> <BR>I mean, sure, some
  of the matrices are in a museum somewhere, but just imagine the lucky bastard who
  buys the patterns at some estate auction. Will he save them? Or will he throw them
  away? Will he even know what they are?

  body: That stuff usually got melted down and re-used for other fonts, or sold as
    scrap... and then melted down and used in a tank or something. Patterns were generally
    made of brass as far as I know; expensive raw material... On the other hand, if
    some guy can end up with a lost Elvis recording in a suitcase bought at a garage
    sale, then hey, who knows what typographic treasures are wallowing next to the
    washer-dryers of suburbia!  :-/ <BR> <BR>Many gems have been lost this way, but
    often it&#39;s not easy to blame anybody - you can&#39;t see what the future holds
    after all. <BR> <BR>hhp
