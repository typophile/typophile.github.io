body: "I want to know what people think about contextual variants, as seen in arabic,
  in latin scripts. I am trying to design a typeface that consists of different letterforms
  according to their context. In otherwords, an a would look different depending if
  it was interacting with an a straight edge letterform, a curved letterform etc...
  My hypothesis is that if we can eliminate some of the unnecessary positive and negative
  space between letters, we can facilitate a more comfortable reading experience.
  I was wondering if people had any insight? resources that I might consider looking
  into? Or any examples where this has already been done. \r\n\r\nthanks! "

    people haven't been trained to read that way so it would take quite a bit of exposure
    -- and retraining -- to get them used to it. That shouldn't be taken to mean I
    think it would not work or that it shouldn't be done. \r\n\r\nA good way to find
    out would be to actually make such a font or a small family, then perhaps have
    a study done by researchers or scientists to validate the merits of such an approach."

  body: Many fonts have contextual alternates, mostly to avoid unsightly collisions.
    A recent success is Ernestine, which makes pairs like rv, rw, ry look better by
    trimming the left serif of the latter glyph so that the bodies can be moved closer
    together. But you need to keep in mind that the different spaces between letters
    can be a big part of what facilitates reading. Quickly differentiating letter
    shapes is important to reading, and just like ascenders and descenders help the
    reader recognize word shapes, so do things like the space in the lower right of
    the r.

  body: "<cite>an a would look different depending if it was interacting with an a
    straight edge letterform</cite>\r\n\r\nBut an a is read, because it looks like
    an a. How would different a shapes be an improvement? Connected scripts have different
    letter shapes to facilitate the connections itself, not to improve the legibility
    of the single letter (I think). I am not convinced that structurally different
    shapes as contextual alternatives or forced ligatures (people have tried this
    before) can be an improvement for Latin.\r\nAt least this is how I understand
    your approach. Small corrections for certain letter combinations are already getting
    more and more common in modern OpenType fonts. \r\n\r\nBut maybe you can create
    some sketches of that approach first? Would probably be easier to talk about it,
    if we can actually see and read it ourselves. "

  body: "This is an idea I have played around with, aiming to regularise the shape
    of smaller white areas between terminals and adjacent shapes.  I sometimes find
    the angularity of triangular shapes that occur when oblique terminals are adjacent
    to vertical stems, or vertical terminals are adjacent to curves, visually distracting.
    I've no idea whether his has any impact on readability, and am not claiming this
    design approach as aiding reading. I just wanted to explore the potential for
    producing a more even pattern of white space between the letters. Obviously, this
    approach is primarily relevent for sans serif types, and perhaps more so for display
    settings than for text (where the particular white space areas may be too small
    to have significant impact).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cochin_3732.png]"

    indeed. But to simply design a typeface in which this feature is present, and
    where it turns out to be unobtrusive, and at least not impair readability, is
    a first step that should not be dismissed as worthless.\r\n\r\nThe example shown
    of changing the shape of the letter \"c\" shows that the benefit to be expected
    from this is the same as that from good kerning - a more even color of the text.\r\n\r\nPeople
    have lived with typographical methods that permitted essentially no kerning, from
    which we can conclude the effect of good kerning is subtle. Sometimes, <em>doing
    it right</em> is its own reward, and designing types as they should be designed
    won't have enough of an impact to bring one fame and fortune - or even significant
    recognition from one's peers."
