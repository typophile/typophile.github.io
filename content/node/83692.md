  body: What would you like this potentially very condensed sans to accomplish? And
    if you don't mind me asking, why Caslon 540?

  body: "Aim for something from around 1900, or in the genre of that era, e.g. Champion.\r\nThat
    will impress typographers you are aware of the face's history.\r\nOtherwise, any
    condensed sans you like the look of.\r\n"

  body: Caslon 540 is a display face. Are you intending to use a very condensed sans
    serif for text??

    face for everything else is adobe caslon. \r\nChampion is a great suggestion.

  body: As to why Caslon - wanted something traditional / classic, literary-ish, with
    a little imperfection... despite it having a distinct period associated with it,
    it also feels sort of timeless...? Is it an odd choice?
