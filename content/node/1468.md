  body: ya 20 is great. but maybe it has more to do with illustration? I don&#39;t
    see how it highlights typography.

  body: 'Having had a go at this, I think the distinctive challenge here is to make
    the shirt visually interesting and still primarily typographic or lettering, rather
    than illustration.  <BR> <BR>In this batch, 28.006 does a nice job of this. <BR>
    <BR>How hard it is to make a good shirt that is mainly typographic I think illustrates
    how type&#39;s design is based on its almost always being supportive, rather than
    the center of attention. '

  body: I&#39;m liking 28.004 - not sure how your job case  shirt is wearing, but
    mine was all cracked after just two washings, so I&#39;m leaning toward the designs
    with less ink.  <BR> <BR>28.027 is cool too - makes me think of a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala"
    target="_blank"> mandala</a>.

    is cracked as well. It&#39;s beautiful.

  body: We talk as much about laundry as t-shirt designs in this thread.  <BR> <BR>It
    can be difficult to find a screenprinter that can really manage large coverage
    areas. It took me quite a white to get one to do our company shirt properly printed
    with its 10x12 print area and 8-color imprint &#40;it used to be 13 colors!&#41;.
    We tell our customers the same washing advice, bj. <BR> <BR>Time to weed through
    all the new designs and find a top three. I need a large glass of wine.
