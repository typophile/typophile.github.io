  just did 2 wiki entries. One worked fine, the second one, I added to the 'book'
  list, then clicked on it and hit 'edit,' wrote it and submit. I thought I checked
  it. It's the 'Complete Guide to Typography.'  I came back this evening and clicked
  on it, and it came up with an empty entry. The bar on the right side of the Wiki
  entry page has it listed, but it wasn't connected to the book list link. I went
  and copied everything over to the 'correct' one, i was just wondering what I did
  wrong, and maybe the MOD wants to delete the superfluous non-linked entry here...\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/complete_manual_of_typography\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEric"

  body: i believe this happened because there was a comma in your title name. I actually
    deleted the article that had "the" in the name and relinked it to the [[books]]
    page, so everything should work now. let me know if you're still having problems.

    god's sakes. It is junk and is making Typophile look amateurish. Well... You are
    the best we have but, please, this sucker doesn't even work.\r\n\r\nGerald"
