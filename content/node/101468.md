  now\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clasing characters_5914.png]\r\n\r\nMy
  metrics are as follows:\r\n\r\nTh highest point on the accents is 901(tops of accents
  and carons etc.) (my UPM is 1000)\r\nThe lowest point on descender is -250\r\nx
  height: 480\r\ncap height 675\r\nAre my accents too big? Are they placed too far
  away from the base glyph?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Your vertical metrics values exceed the UPM (901+250=1151) and this behaviour
    would indicate that you have not balanced the metrics accordingly. If you read
    through [[http://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf|Karsten Luecke's guide
    to font metrics]] carefully and adjust your settings accordingly you should find
    that the vertical metrics start behaving as you would expect. At the very least
    you will have a greater understanding of what those settings change.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    the Typophile threads listed below all deal with this issue in detail:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/77906\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13081"

  body: "If I read correctly, 901 is the maximum ascender value, i.e. WinAscent, not
    the TypoAscender (which the OP does not mention).  I've always understood that
    it's TypoAscender and TypoDescender that should fit within the UPM, not WinAscent/Descent.\r\n\r\nTypogruffer,
    what is your actual character ascender value, i.e. the highest point of any base
    (non-accented) character?  And do your OS/2 and hhea table metrics match it and
    the other values mentioned (as described in the referenced PDF)?\r\n"

    using Karsten's PDF as a guide. I will get back to you with the results.\r\n"
