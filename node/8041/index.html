<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I recently posted a request for a font to be identified on the Type Identification Board and received a rapid reply. I was reviewing a document and saw a font used that I liked. While trying to track down that font (Bank Gothic), I realized that in order for a sheet to print with that font used, it would have to have been installed on that machine (at least I think so). How does one know if the font they are using is being done so legally? <br> <br>All Microsoft Windows machines are provided with a certain preloaded package of fonts which I would assume implies that they (the fonts) can be used for any purpose. Is there a standard set of fonts that is "free" or available for unlimited public use? For instance, Arial and Times New Roman would appear to be universally approved for unlimited use. Is there, for lack of a better description, a regulatory body that controls this? <br> <br>I searched through the directory structure of several computers at work and compared the font lists in each and they are all different. The majority of fonts were common, but each had files available exclusive to that particular machine. How does Microsoft or Apple/Macintosh decide which fonts are loaded when a machine is built? Do they pay royalties to someone? Does someone own the rights to fonts as common as Times New Roman or Arial? <br> <br>I appreciate any time anyone could give me in answering these questions. Typography was something I took for granted until recently but it is fascinating. I have found several font sites and will sit and surf and critique (to myself) fonts now. It really is amazing the diversity that exists. <br> <br>Thanks again! <br> <br>PS Does anyone (or everyone) know who is credited (if there is someone) with creating the "Jackdaws loves my big sphinx of quartz" tagline for display of all letters of the alphabet?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Most of the fonts bundled with MacOS, and many older versions of Adobe applications were licensed from other foundries. (Helevtica, for instance, which ships with MacOS, is licensed from Linotype; it is not owned by Apple). <br> <br>Adobe has its own type library, which has grown over the years. I believe that Thomas posted here some time ago that Adobe was no longer bundling non-Adobe fonts with their software. Was that for all applications, or just some? In any event, even Adobe fonts that come "free" with Adobe products are covered by the software's license. So, one cannot do whatever one wants with them (like freely distribute copies, etc). In this regard, bundled fonts are no different from fonts that you would license from a foundry on your own, except that some foundries have more restrictive EULAs, and some have less restrictive ones.</div>
