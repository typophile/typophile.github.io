  wasn't even close, and Whatfontis identified it as FORQUE which is a creative commons
  free font. I'm almost certain I've seen a commercial font like this.  Anyone care
  to help a fellow out? It's like a song I can't get out of my head. \r\n\r\nAlso,

    page that seem familiar. It just looks very like something I''ve seen on Myfonts.
    It''s going to bug me until I know one way or the other. '
