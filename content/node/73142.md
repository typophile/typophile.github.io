  body: "I'm not sure I have much to offer in the way of help here, but I have only
    seen two faces that I can remember with such an idiosycratic distribution of heavy
    and light strokes. Those two are both by John Bomparte, and one is more or less
    just a serif treatment of the other: Monique (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/monique-sans/)
    and Michelle (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/michelle/). \r\n\r\nIt's entirely
    possible that it's a custom job, or by a tiny foundry that isn't represented in
    any of the main archival contexts.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone has seen it elsewhere?\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Here's a bigger sample.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wharton_5135.jpg]\r\n\r\n-NJ"
