body: "Hello everyone, I'd love to hear your comments regarding a brand logo I made
  for a company that sell special anti-stick coatings created using nanotechnology
  that protects different surfaces from dirt and corrosion and decreases cleaning
  time.\r\n\r\nIt's called QuickNano because the idea is that you can use latest nanotechnology
  quickly in your own house.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what typeface to use. On the picture
  is Myriad Pro. Maybe you can suggest an alternative typeface?\r\n\r\nDoes the basic
  concept work? Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Qnano-2_4696.jpg]"

  body: "With the color and the droplet I immediately think it's something water/ocean
    related, doesn't really give me a tech vibe at all. The Q icon is kind of interesting,
    I think a more modern looking sans and maybe a different color palette could go
    a long way.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head maybe Klavika, Stalemate, Neo Sans?"

  body: I agree with Chris. I'm getting the water purification, waste treatment or
    recycling, but not the non-stick coating. Shades of gray is probably a better
    choice in terms of color, and I would look at other concepts that do not involve
    a droplet. Droplet is confusing.

  body: "Thank you for your comments!\r\n\r\nFirst we tried to make a scientific logo,
    that'll say \"science\", \"nano\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Quicknano-logotypes_6244.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
    then we thought that we need a friendly logo, since the product is for home use
    and it is not a scientific company logo.\r\n\r\nThen we started working with all
    these water droplets, because the effect of the product makes water bead up on
    the treated surface and roll off in droplets. So I figured that this logo answers
    to friendlyness and to main effect (water rolls off the protected surface).\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the typeface could be more technological. Here are some typefaces I
    tried:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QNfonts_4388.jpg]\r\n\r\nI also
    switched the colours so the word \"nano\" will be more bright.\r\n\r\nLooking
    forward for your comments! Thanks!"

  body: "Worry about color later in the process. Get the mark where it needs to be
    first.\r\n\r\nSomething is just off--the letterform is close to being a Q but
    for whatever reason I don't find that it's right.\r\n\r\nIt could be a number
    of things, like the size of the droplet itself, its angle, etc. The droplet gives
    me the feeling that its separate from the oval behind it. As if its the letter
    O with something coming out of it, instead of saying to me that both elements
    are incorporated together to make one letter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps trying flipping the
    droplet on its vertical axis so it spills down to the right.\r\n\r\n"

    the water comes <em>out of</em> the surface, not that it \"rolls out\"."

    techno IMHO). What do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Qnano-4_6559.jpg]"

  body: That's looking better. More Q like. I think the droplet now needs to be moved
    left a touch, then rotated clockwise slightly. Just compare it against the real
    Q below and adjust until you're happy.

    feel derivative to me. I would say start over.

  body: It's also pretty much the same mark, changing the direction of the droplet
    etc isn't changing the tone or image conveyed.

    \r\nIt's not about making what we think looks good, it's about making what's right
    for the job. We're also not the client so...you know.\r\n\r\nAlso, curious...if
    you're not a designer, why are you on the logo project?"

    can't tell you precisely what to do, but I'll attempt to offer you one direction
    of inspiration:\r\n\r\nIf it were me designing the logo, the one thing I would
    take note of are that the company's final product (the whole) is created by many
    small things (the parts, the nano molecules if you will), coming together as one.
    So I could envision some sort of logo in which smaller components come together
    to form a larger mark.\r\n\r\nBut if you're not a designer this is probably out
    of your league--and at the very least for now you've made it look more like a
    Q."
