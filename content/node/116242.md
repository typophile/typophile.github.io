  body: "Looks like Eagle Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/ except
    for the _G_. Eagle Bold was the signature font for the US WPA/NRA of the 1930s.
    It has been the inspiration for several similar fonts including Naked Power Black
    by Typodermic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/naked-power/ which has a
    _G_ in the Futura style of the image. Still looking for an exact match. Failing
    that, Eagle Bold would work as an approximation if the _G_ was edited.\r\nA little
    lighter weight , but also worth trying, Hurme Geometric Sans Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans/
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-2/\r\nDark enough,
    but misses the mark on several counts Telefon Black http://www.identifont.com/find?font=telefon+black&q=Go\r\nDon"

  body: "I agree with Don's suggestion of Eagle, as an Art Deco type that has a similar
    look. Mark Simonson also has a font family that includes much of the Art Deco
    vocabulary in the form of alternates for his [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/?refby=bowfin|Mostra
    Nuova]] family. See the Bold Alt D variant for the closest match.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: I really thought it was [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2|HI Neutraface
    No.2]] Display Titling but even if some letters look pretty spot on (/A, /S, /R,
    /N...) they are obviously some off (/M centre vertex even with the alternate,
    /G crossbar transition...). After some diggin', I finally found the origin of
    these samples. It comes from [[http://www.starwoodhotels.com|(Star)W(ood) Hotels]]
    identity and it's actually their (new) corporate typeface called 'W Sans New'.
    I'm still convinced it's based on Neutraface No. 2 Display Titling though.

  body: "You might ask Chester Jenkins for the terms under which he made the font
    for W. If he sold them the rights for  forever you are out of luck. If he sold
    them an exclusive  license for a limited number of years you might be able to
    purchase the right to use a copy after that period. If I understand correctly,
    he copyrighted the font in 2011. Three years have already passed. \r\nDon"

  body: Don't think it is commercially available and actually (nothing personal of
    course don't want to sound offending :), I don't get the point to buy (and so
    reuse) a font that has been specifically done for a company. And for this case,
    you could easily go with Neutraface No.2 :) and if you like this kind of fonts,
    we could probably compile a good list. We already have Don and Mikes's excellent
    suggestions of Eagle and Mostra Nuova.
