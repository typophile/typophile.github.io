  Post Script Opentype fonts and using this process at the moment to hint.\r\n\r\n1.
  Set the Alignment Zones - Not using auto zones which doesn't seem to do a great
  job.\r\n2. Auto Hint the fonts with either FontLabs Auto Hinting or Adobe's AFDKO
  - I've tried both to compare results. I then adjust hints that don't seem to work.\r\n3.
  Set the Standard Stems  - Again not using auto stems but the method described <a
  href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=NotesOnHintingWithFL\"
  target=\"_blank\">here</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter using this process and changing lots
  of different parameters I'm still getting hints that don't seem to be working.\r\n\r\nThis
  image shows the Sub/Superscript, the Superscript on the right is jumping all over
  the place at small sizes.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can try to improve the
  hinting ?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sub_6709.png]"

    that bottom alignment zones belong in 'Secondary zones'.

    the x height blue zone?). I would be happy to look at your vfb file if you like.\r\n\r\nmalcolm"
