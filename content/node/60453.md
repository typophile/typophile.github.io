body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm in the beginning phases of designing a logo for a community
  website that allows subscribers to create their own website within, a sort of mixture
  between geocities, myspace, hubpages and squarespace - if you can imagine what that
  might look like. I've had little time to think hard about this but this is what
  I've come up with so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo 1_4525.1.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
  1_6593.2.png]\r\n\r\nThis logo (as presented here) forms the top bar (look at facebook
  or myspace to see what I'm getting at). That top bar will span the entire width
  of the web browser and then below will begin the actual website of the subscriber.\r\n\r\nAny
  initial thoughts? \r\n\r\nThanks"

    website header itself, it's somewhat redundant.\r\nFor the typography I'm not
    that keen of it. However I lke the 2nd option more.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks DavM, I guess the idea behind the .co.ke at the end is because this
    is very much a web-based project, and to use you as an example, your website would
    be davm.myurl.co.ke, where myurl = what you see in the pic (I don't like how Google
    finds these threads so that's why I didn't write the name). Perhaps you're right
    though, maybe just drop it. I prefer the second option too.\r\n\r\nAny more thoughts?"

  body: "Agreed on dropping co.ke (even if the k is so cute!).\r\nI think anyway that
    the first option, though a little too heavy, has much more personality.\r\nThe
    second one is far too internet generic for establishing a brand."

  body: 'Thanks Riccardo. I like the second one but you''re right, Arial Rounded has
    been used by many internet brands like Skype. The first is called Berlin Sans,
    I like it because it isn''t one you see online. Which leads me to another question,
    in case there are any typography historians out there: who created Berlin Sans?
    what for? what are its connotations? what is its normal context? Any other font
    recommendations that capture the internet brand feel but still unique and fresh?
    possibly friendly and not too expensive looking? (our members will pay a small
    annual fee)'

  body: "From MyFonts (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/berlin-sans/overview.html):\r\n\r\n<cite>Berlin
    Sans is based on a brilliant alphabet from the late twenties, originally released
    by Bauer with the name Negro, the very first sans that Lucian Bernhard ever designed.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    see it has various weights. Have you tried setting it in roman?\r\nAs per a different
    typeface suggestion, I would search for one that offers some distinctive/unusual
    letterform among those in the logo."
