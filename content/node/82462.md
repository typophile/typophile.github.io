  Torah Typeset.\r\nThe font I am looking for is very similar but the differences
  are quite obvious to the trained eye. I have included an image for you to see the
  differences between fonts.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me find the name for the
  \"unknown\" font.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help."
