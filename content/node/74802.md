  you might find it of interest\r\n\r\n<cite>Design Week / LA is an annual celebration
  of design that inspires and brings together Los Angeles' abundant and vital design
  communities by promoting a wider awareness of design through initiatives and programming
  that highlight the richness and diversity of design activities happening throughout
  the communities of LA. This year's Design Week / LA will be taking place October
  9 - October 17.\r\n\r\n[[http://designweekla.org/]]\r\n[[http://twitter.com/DesignWeekLA|DWkLA
  on Twitter]]\r\n[[http://www.facebook.com/pages/DesignWeekLA/121595634559184?v=info&ref=ts|DWkLA
  on Facebook]]\r\n\r\nIf you're organizing or promoting a design-related event during
  Design Week, we'd love to feature it on the site. Please visit our \"Add an Event\"
  page to submit your event info:\r\n\r\n[[http://designweekla.org/add-event/]]\r\n\r\nOr,
  if you're in the LA area and want to organize an event but need support, this would
  be a great time to check out AIGA Los Angeles' new micro-programming initiative
  (and you don't need to be an AIGA member to take advantage):\r\n\r\n[[http://aigalosangeles.org/features/2010/07/micro-programming-faqs.php]]</cite>\r\n\r\nHope
  to see some of you out and about!\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nSpencer Cross\r\nhttp://tokyofarm.com\r\nhttp://kernspiracy.com\r\nhttp://designweekla.org\r\n"
