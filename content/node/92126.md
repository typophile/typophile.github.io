body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nFirst time posting at typophile so am not 100% sure if this
  is the location. I don't have a specific font I am after I am only just starting
  to learn about typography and was hoping someone might be able to give me some ideas
  of fonts that convey a feeling of change or difference.\r\n\r\nIt would be even
  better if they provide a sense of moving towards change, or moving to a 'different'
  place.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help, and feel free to bump to another thread
  if more appropriate.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDan"

  body: If this is just for a heading or title or logo, have you considered contorting
    the entire phrase to give it what you consider the feeling of 'change'?  Such
    as gradually increasing in size for growth, or a sinusoidal design for variability,
    etc.

  body: "hi guys thanks for the fast responses. It is for a logo. Company is called
    delta cycles and the premise is that delta cycles exists to promote cycling through
    a change to the norm. Principally they will be manufacturing bikes out of bamboo,
    which isn't entirely new, however it is different for the marketplace in Australia,
    where they operate.\r\n\r\nThey have an icon which they are wedded to (see http://www.deltacycles.com.au),
    however they would like a font for the name that will look as good on a bike as
    it does on printed material. The owner likes the look of the rapha logo (http://rapha.cc)
    but doesn't want to rip them off as it will just look copy cat which he doesn't
    want.\r\n\r\nHope this helps on the input front.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDan"

    now.
