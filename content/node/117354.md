    Gothic...

  body: Really tiny samples. When I zoomed in a loooot, I could see that it must be
    <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-HHJRl8">Serif Gothic</a>. Count yourself lucky that
    they used such a distinctive typeface.

  body: I also second <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-HHJRl8">Serif Gothic</a>. Mostly
    judging by the 'R' and the way it has a rounded leg and with the gap where the
    leg and counter connect.
