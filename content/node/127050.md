    more details about the sample (source, age)? It\u2019s very similar to Sabon,
    but not a match. Knowing if it\u2019s from a website or a print piece might help
    with the ID."

    blowing up your sample and sharpening it in Photoshop, I think we are dealing
    with Sabon here:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/"
