<cite>If you produced expensive, frequently pirated software, you'd probably want the process for buying it to be as easy on the customer as possible, right? If you're Adobe, not so much. Yet another reader writes in to share her frustrations with trying to buy Adobe's Dreamweaver.</cite>

I've never run into issues with upgrading or purchasing Adobe software (granted I don't do the purchasing). But it's interesting that a simple process of upgrading a single product [GoLive CS2 to Dreamweaver CS3] is giving this person such headaches. 

Has anyone else encountered similar issues?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've never had any issues either. I buy the software, pop in the disc, it either finds my the serial number from my previous version, or if it's an install on a clean drive, I type in the old one, then the new, let it do its thing, and I'm done.

I guess my only issue is that I hate typing in those HUGE serial numbers.

I have the occasional minor glitch installing other software, but nothing like she had. Her problems were quite annoying, but I think it's safe to say they're not the norm.</div>

When upgrading to CS3 (I had CS and Macromedia's MX 2004 Suite) I ordered a stand-alone upgrade for Fireworks, under the mistaken assumption that it would upgrade my Macromedia MX 2004 Suite version of Fireworks. The website and documentation I saw didn't suggest there would be any issues. After installing everything and proving that CS3 Design worked as advertised but Fireworks didn't, I called Adobe to find out why my Fireworks CS3 wasn't working.

Turns out that the Fireworks CS3 upgrade only updates a stand-alone Fireworks license, not the MX 2004 suite license. Adobe said that I would need to purchase a new, full version of Fireworks. I didn't like that and I really didn't "need" Fireworks, so instead I went through the "Adobe refunds me while I destroy my Fireworks CS 3 copy" process. I discovered soon thereafter that several other people were effected by the same lack of information on the Adobe User-to-User forums. And shortly after that, Adobe put up additional information on the website to clarify that you couldn't upgrade to Fireworks CS3 using a Macromedia suite license. And they eventually did a special deal where if you bought the CS3 upgrade they would reduce the price on the full version of Fireworks.

In Adobe's favor, the service reps were very apologetic and professional. But the thing that still bugs me is that they didn't think creatively about how to solve my problem (I wanted an upgrade, not to buy a full new version!) and they could have completely avoided the entire issue if they had the right information online!

And I don't want to even get started on the Adobe Acrobat "Yahoo Search" tool and FedEx Kinkos "print" button. Proof that marketing is taking over the engineers at Adobe...</div>

Yep. I recall spending 3 days on the phone with Adobe to buy a font. 

Adobe is really no different than other giant software companies (or any other semi-monopolistic industry...yes I'm looking at you giant Telco and Cableco). 

The support folks are good people, the company/system, not so much.
