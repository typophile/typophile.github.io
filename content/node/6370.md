body: Can someone tell why this 98SE computer stopped displaying some regular fonts
  both on the desktop and in message boxes? Within MS Word the fonts show properly.
  Deleted ttfcache, have enough memory &#40;288MB&#41;, problem only started a few
  days ago and possibly the problem is related to some dll that Windows uses to display
  fonts. BTW - there are installed only about 344 fonts in Windows/Fonts. <BR> <BR>Thank
  you for any assistance or direction on where to get help!

  body: It turns out the fonts that do not display correctly &#40;90!&#41; are not
    corrupt. A new font to replace a badly displaying font was downloaded and installed
    and it still displayed wrongly in X-Fonter but it displays correctly in MS Word
    and also if one simply opens it from Windows\Fonts. <BR> <BR>Whatever dll or app
    that Windows uses to display fonts in certain apps is what is corrupt. <BR> <BR>What
    can that app be?
