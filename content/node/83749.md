body: "Some months back, it was announced here that Firefox 4.0 would use Microsoft's
  DirectWrite text rendering, meaning, among other things, that CFF OpenType fonts
  would be rendered using ClearType subpixel rendering, like TTFs, instead of the
  old, much lamented Windows PostScript rasteriser. When Firefox 4.0 arrived, I was
  surprised to find that DWrite rendering was not active by default, and that I had
  to manually set some config flags in order to activate it (not something I'd be
  comfortable recommending to the average browser user). This week I wrote to John
  Daggett at Mozilla, and asked him to comment on this and whether there is any change
  in Firefox 5.0. He graciously gave his permission for me to post his reply here,
  and to continue the discussion on this forum.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>DirectWrite is
  on by default but only when hardware acceleration is enabled. There's a long list
  of whitelisted/blacklisted drivers that we maintain, mainly because of various driver
  bugs. MS has something similar but I imagine they can support a wider set of drivers
  because they know more about precisely where drivers have bugs. The latest numbers
  indicate that over half of Firefox users on Windows 7 run without acceleration enabled.
  That's based on a combination of underlying hardware and driver versions so those
  those running without acceleration will probably decrease over time as drivers get
  updated.\r\n\r\nI'm pushing to have DirectWrite enabled *always* on machines that
  support it (i.e. whether hardware accelaration is enabled or not) but that's been
  hard to do because there's been a lot of pushback among users who are accustomed
  to existing GDI rendering. This is especially true for the core web fonts (Arial,
  Tahoma, Verdana) at 9-13ppem sizes. The default DirectWrite rasterization is relatively
  light and so there have been a fair number of complaints about fonts being \"fuzzy\".
  For now, we've created a list of fonts that default to GDI rendering at small sizes
  (<16ppem) with fonts like Arial, Tahoma, Verdana on it. I'm hoping we'll be able
  to sufficiently resolve this for those users to allow us to enable DirectWrite always
  in a future version.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOne immediate thought that I have regarding
  this is that perhaps Mozilla could find a way to enable DWrite by default for CFF
  fonts? I don't think anyone is going to complain that this is worse than the old
  PS rasteriser rendering!"

    I fail to see how the same hardware issues won't put the kabosh on CFF DWrite
    rendering, too.</em>\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph of John D's comments indicates
    that this is not fundamentally a hardware/driver issue, but a design decision,
    i.e. that it would be possible to enable DWrite by default \u2018whether hardware
    acceleration is enabled or not\u2019 (presuming an OS that supports DWrite). He
    further suggests that specific (TTF) fonts can be excluded by name, so what I'm
    wondering is if other (CFF) fonts could be <em>included</em> by flavour.\r\n\r\n<em>Also,
    isn't it a big surprise that Microsoft seems to have the leg up on getting DWrite
    to work?</em>\r\n\r\nMS invest in massive hardware testing and maintain a very
    extensive driver registry, so of course they have an advantage over companies
    that don't do the same level of hardware and driver testing."

  body: "IE always uses D2D/DWrite. Only if there are known problems with graphics
    card or driver, IE9 will use D2D software rendering. This should produce the same
    (although slower) layout and rendering results as hardware accelerated mode, incuding
    ClearType with subpixel positioning. \r\n\r\nHere is relevant post on IE team
    blog:\r\n\r\n<a>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/04/01/getting-the-most-from-ie9-and-your-gpu.aspx</a>\r\n\r\nBesides
    rendering quality, compatibility of layout is also very important (e.g. same site
    laid out using pixel-aligned or subpixel glyph metrics). Having different layout
    results depending on user's hardware would be support nighmare, we went through
    this. It is not clear from John's response if this actually happens in FireFox.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

    what results are you seeing for otf fonts in FF5? In some tests I am seeing DirectWrite
    ClearType rendering."

  body: "Mike, I've not had an opportunity to test FF5 yet (too busy), but my understanding
    of John Daggett's comments is that you will see DWrite rendering of both CFF and
    TTF fonts in both FF4 and FF5 <em>if hardware acceleration is enabled,</em> but
    that some core TTF fonts are currently excluded due to negative user feedback
    on the rendering (perhaps fixed, according to Si's comment).\r\n\r\nSo what I
    take away from this is that what you will see in FF4 and 5 will depend on both
    the machine being used and which specific font is used.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion was
    that if, as John D suggests, it would be possible to support DWrite regardless
    of hardware acceleration, but there are concerns about rendering of some TTFs
    and hence the possibility of using DWrite for some fonts and GDI for others, it
    might be possible to first apply default DWrite rendering to CFF fonts, since
    they will more surely benefit relative to the old PS rendering."

  body: I understand reasoning why decision about subpixel rendering can be based
    on font/size, but using hardware capabilities for this purpose is strange (you
    can use it for other puuposes, of course). Results on screen produced by DWrite
    should not depend on whether you use hardware or software rendering. And the other
    way around, DWrite provides ability to produce both subpixel ClearType or GDI-compatible
    rendering, independent from hardware mode. Would be interesting to hear what John
    D think.
