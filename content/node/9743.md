  <BR> <BR>Currently we have a CGI shopping cart that works pretty well.  Basically,
  I maintain MySQL tables of our products, sizes, scents and prices.  I have PHP pages
  that read the MySQL tables, and using forms, call the CGI shopping cart scripts
  necessary to add items to the cart.  I like how this works, because we have many
  products, and I already have a PHP interface I use to maintain the products. <BR>
  <BR>One crucial aspect of the CGI shopping cart is that it allows us to see pending
  orders, in order to calculate actual shipping costs before we charge credit cards.
  <BR> <BR>But, not being a CGI person, I cannot customize the shopping cart, nor
  can I pass PHP session variables to the invoice.  Also, the CGI cart has one drawback...it
  requires cookies. <BR> <BR>So I want to switch to a PHP shopping cart that provides
  the same flexibility.  One that does ONLY the cart portion...not the inventory and
  product tables.  One that I can pass information to from my pages in order to add
  items to a user&#39;s shopping cart. <BR> <BR>All of my research has only uncovered
  PHP shopping carts that you have to enter all your products into.  Are there any
  PHP shopping carts that ONLY provide the shopping cart and invoicing piece, and
  allow the web master to handle the products and pricing tables? <BR> <BR>Thanks
