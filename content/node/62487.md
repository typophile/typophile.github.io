  body: "I only had the patience to search about 1/3 of the sansserif collection at
    MyFonts. The two closest fonts I found were Font Bureau [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/|Agenda]]
    and Red Rooster [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/dundee-rr/|Dundee}}.
    They both have a similar 1, closed 4 and assymmetric 3 with an upward angled top
    counter. Best I could do in the time I gave myself. Neither is exact.\r\n\r\nInformation
    that might help is the age and place of origin of the sample. My impression is
    that this is rather old, say 1930's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sam, I have to disagree with Mike on the age of this sign. \r\n\r\nThe Braille
    appears to have been put up at the same time as the numerals, which would date
    it after the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 (this is assuming
    the sign is in the US).\r\n\r\nThe disproportionate spacing between <strong>1</strong>
    and <strong>4</strong> also places it in the digital age; it indicates this was
    set on a keyboard, where all numerals have a one-en set width. "

  body: "Thank you all for the posts. I'm about to look though the suggestions but
    I wanted to answer your questions real quick.  The sign is maybe 3-4 years old
    and I just found out the manufacturer last night.  \r\n\r\nMy boss told me to
    recreate the sign and left it at that.  I spent about an hour and a half browsing
    font libraries and to be honest after about 20 minutes they just start blending
    together... I'm still a typeface newb I guess.  Anyway, last night just before
    I left work he said I didn't have to bother with the ADA molded type because the
    manufacturer would have that on file. \r\n\r\nAlso it looks like Scala Sans is
    a match :)  \r\n\r\nThank you all for your hard work. It is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nSam "
