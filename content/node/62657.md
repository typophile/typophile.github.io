  fonts and edited a couple letters so suit the logo better. I honestly hate using
  a straight font without editing it for the logo design. Please let me know what
  you think ;)\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: "Hey! I really, really like this logo. I don't know if you wanted criticism,
    but I thought of a few things that could maybe make it better.\r\n\r\n1. The \"l\"
    person is a little too tall, I think. If you made all the other \"people\" taller,
    maybe it would make the l person seem less out of place.\r\n\r\n2. I don't like
    the gradient drop shadow. I don't think it works for a logo. Consider doing a
    different angle of it? I just don't like how it's so invisible more to the left
    of the logo.\r\n\r\nHope this helps! I really like the design.\r\n\r\n-- David"
