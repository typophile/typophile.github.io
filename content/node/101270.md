  Baskerville, Optima, Century Schoolbook, or Palatino, or many others) seemed to
  me to be favoring the recent too much (among recent ones, there's Stone... typefaces

    if Copperplate Gothic was chosen not because of its quality, but because of its
    use, that might make sense. But if you go back to 1969 in your imagination, when
    Times Roman existed in quality authentic forms and was used well, I think it stands
    up to comparison with Caslon and Baskerville... and thus it <em>should</em> be
    on a list of the best typefaces of all time.\r\n\r\nEven if some of the digital
    versions today wouldn't be that far out of place on a list of the worst ones either.\r\n\r\nBut
    a list of the \"worst typefaces\" is sort of like a list of the worst comic books
    or the worst movies - those lists never seem to include the <em>really bad</em>
    ones, only the bad ones from sources that should have known better.\r\n\r\nThus,
    you won't find [[http://fontforge.org/sfds/index.html|Caslon Roman]] - or, more
    appropriately, the typeface from which it is derived (and I don't mean Caslon)
    - on a list of the worst typefaces of all time. Not that I fault George Williams;
    I praise his effort in making available a Unicode font with a wide character range
    for free.\r\n\r\nBut the face itself is based on older Chinese and/or Japanese
    versions of the Latin alphabet, made without the proper cultural basis for the
    aesthetic of the Latin script. It is hideous in appearance, to put it briefly.\r\n\r\nAnd
    then there's Fifteenth Century, now known as Caslon Antique. Before we had Comic
    Sans to kick around, that one used to get a lot of criticism from typographers."

  body: "Articles like these really annoy me because it perpetuates flawed ideas on
    typography coming from the mainstream rather than making informed judgements on
    these typefaces. For example, while I agree with some of the statements on Copperplate
    Gothic, it seems really silly to criticize a glyphic, industrial-inspired typeface
    designed more than 110 years ago for not being inspiring to the modern viewer.
    Would we expect it to? It's not like we're marvelling on the modernism of Akzidenz
    Grotesk either.\r\n\r\n\"but it has made it on this list because it is so madly
    overused by the amateur or lazy designer, often thrown onto a page because it
    has that \"basic blocky text\" look to it. Professional designers find Arial quiet
    nauseating.\"\r\nDo you find this to be true? From my experience it's not like
    that at all. A professional designer wouldn't use Arial because it has that \"basic
    blocky text\" look to it, or I would argue the designer is seriously lacking in
    knowledge and judgement (but then I've also seen professional designers make the
    most laughable remarks about Helvetica in the Helvetica documentary, so who knows.),
    but a professional designer would use Arial when applicable. I know in this context
    Arial wasn't necessarily selected just for its design, but the government of Rotterdam
    uses Arial for its branding and I'm actually damn glad they didn't use Helvetica.
    http://studiodumbar.com/work/city-of-rotterdam\r\n\r\nThe article features a picture
    that says \"Arial. The perfect way to show that you just don't care.\" Helvetica
    often seems to fit that statement as well, possibly more so than Arial. It's not
    the average user but the amateur designers who think Helvetica is the designer's
    choice and therefore make a judgement based on misinformation. In fact, it's this
    same misinformation with which articles like these are written.\r\n\r\nI can see
    the tradition of judging typefaces on their popularity rather than its design
    and application, which I think is a sad practice. This way the mainstream tends
    to outlaw typefaces which were perfectly fine before they started misusing it.
    I would rather educate people on the use of certain typefaces than ban these typefaces
    for its misuse, which is particularly the case with Comic Sans. The shirt that
    says \"I love to hate Comic Sans\" actually seems to be the sentiment of the bancomicsans
    movement. It's not that the website is so bad, but it's just wonderful to hate
    something together because it validates your taste, even if that taste was influenced
    by the movement in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf it's all about popularity and application
    then I tend to put Trajan on the bad list. \"Some designers criticise its over-use
    in the movie industry - it has even earned the nickname \"the movie font\" - but
    it rarely looks bad and can always sell a movie!\". It rarely looks bad, but it
    almost always looks contextually bad.\r\n\r\nWhere does that practice come from
    anyway? You would think for movies there is a budget to hire a professional typographer
    and type designer and do something with the title of the movie. Something different
    from putting a glyphic roman typeface on a poster about Egyptian mummies; something
    different fom using a glyphic roman typeface for a British ship from 1912. Neil
    deGrasse Tyson complained about the sky in Titanic in the scene after the Titanic
    sank not being the correct one and a portion of it being mirrored (http://news.discovery.com/space/astronomy/neil-degrasse-tyson-tightens-titanic-accuracy-120402.htm)
    and it was fixed. I feel like our knowledge should be valued more, and perhaps
    we should be more expressive about the mistakes in typography. I think we're relatively
    humble while I don't necessarily feel a reason to be.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was no
    mention of Futura being used in the fashion industry. I don't think the author
    of the article looks at fashion magazines."

    to use Monotype Grotesque where it is appropriate, but anyone who would use (gasp,
    shudder) Arial for anything important is showing he has no taste.\r\n\r\nAnd it's
    also possible to say that this position is one of mere snobbery.\r\n\r\nBut it
    is legitimate to say that Monotype Grotesque was, like other typefaces, designed
    to look good... and it could hardly have been improved by being thrust into the
    Procrustean bed of Helvetica metrics. If you want a sans-serif face more suitable
    to body copy than Helvetica, there is Univers!\r\n\r\nArial isn't all that terrible,
    though, and even if one can make an ironclad case that there is almost never a
    case where Arial is best if Monotype Grotesque, Univers, and Helvetica are available,
    lots of people do not have lots of typefaces available (not having bought a Corel
    product for the Bitstream collection) and just use what was built into Windows.\r\n\r\nIt
    is, I suppose, an entirely legitimate part of a professional graphic designer's
    job to make his work not look like it was done by Joe Average on a laser printer,
    and that means avoiding overused faces even though there is nothing bad about
    them. But this is about something other than pure aesthetics, and when that fact
    is not noted, arguments result from the confusion. Times Roman doesn't look different
    because of how many other people are using it, but typography is also used as
    an exhibition of status."

  body: "<cite>Most professional designers would strongly prefer not to use Arial</cite>\r\n\r\nYes,
    because of the controversy, not because of its design. Professional designers
    wouldn't touch Comic Sans either while it's not a bad typeface for comic books.\r\n\r\n<cite>but
    anyone who would use (gasp, shudder) Arial for anything important is showing he
    has no taste.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm personally convinced this is a placebo effect.
    If Arial was just another typeface without all the funny business with licensing
    etc. which made it controversial, I don't think as many people will dislike Arial.
    It's also a strange practice to compare it to one other typeface and consider
    Arial to be of poor taste simply because it doesn't look like the other typeface.
    I'm not accusing you of this, but it's very common among people who actually don't
    know much about type. The fact that we type designers also get affected by this
    controversy is painful to me to see.\r\n\r\nI tend to avoid Arial because of the
    controversy, not because of the design. I have to say though, it has never been
    a particularly beautiful typeface to me, but there are many typefaces like that.
    There's plenty to dislike about Helvetica as well. In fact, whoever uses Helvetica
    likely has no taste either. Not that's it's distasteful, but usually it's not
    a design-conscious choice to select Helvetica. It's the placebo effect again,
    where people will use it simply because they hear it's good. It's not, but it's
    very hard to alter the reputation of a typeface.\r\n\r\nI don't think it can be
    said that Studio Dumbar has poor taste either. It's one of the best design agencies
    of the Netherlands and among the top design agencies of the world. Obviously that
    doesn't make each and every one of their choices objectively good, but it does
    show how Arial can be used well and I appreciate the fact that the agency doesn't
    seem affected by what the mainstream thinks. It's our job to create trends, not
    to let the mainstream restrict our design decisions.\r\n\r\n<cite>And I've seen
    many corporations specify Arial because they know that every employee and vendor
    already has it.</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd probably this is a primary reason for selecting
    Arial, but there were several other options for free and/or default fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    also have to say I think Arial is actually a better typeface, technically. It's
    more legible due to the greater variety in letter shapes, the hinting is far superior
    to Helvetica (Helvetica renders horribly on the web in Windows environments) and
    in Helvetica I can see it's not designed by a proper type designer while Arial
    is. I can see why people prefer Helvetica though, because there are more alignments
    so it looks more orderly, but this is also why it's not a good typeface for body
    text. You may dislike Arial aesthetically but it's technically better than Helvetica.
    Saying anyone who uses Arial for anything important is rather silly in my opinion."
