And I suddenly realized that tracking is linear - not proportional. I don't know why but I had naively thought it was proportional.

It must be far too processor intensive to be otherwise - but ideally speaking... wouldn't it be better to open spaces between letters and the letters pace on a proportional basis?

Aside from making your computer dead slow - what downsides do you see?

At small sizes proportional tracking probably wouldn’t work because hardly any space would be added to letters with narrow or negative sidebearings and I think that this would probably generate some very weird looking words with v and w in them. It would probably work better at larger sizes, but at that point there’s going to be manual intervention anyway, so I doubt it would be especially useful. </div>

That would be the desired effect, James, not a negative. If what you say is true, all letters would have the same sidebearings and no kerning.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, in David Kindersley's theory, if the font has been correctly spaced in the first place then linear tracking should be OK. 

But Robert Slimbach says that in larger optical sizes the spacing on rounds and straights need to be adjusted differently. If this is also true for ideal tracking, then percentage wouldn't cut it either, as you'd need to discriminate between straight-straight round-round and straight-round. 

I think tracking the lower case of a well spaced font is very likely to go wrong if it is more than a small amount in any case. Of course with small tracking, any non-linearity of ideal tracking has less of an impact. What is 'small' some of the experienced book designers here on typophile can probably tell you. Upper case can take much more positive tracking and probably Kindersley is right about that.   </div>

I had a non-proportional tracking in mind that would stay fixed at an absolute value, regardless of the size; e.g. +2pt instead of +20/1000em. I miss such an option of optical tracking – tight(er) for larger sizes, loose(r) for smaller sizes, every now and then. Well, not very often.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, the principle difficulty of proportional tracking is captured in the question 'Proportional to what?' Sidebearing measurements capture a distance between the origin point and advance width, respectively, and the left and right extremes of the glyph outline. That tells you absolutely nothing about appropriate optical spacing, which is a complex relationship between three factors: size and shape of inter-letter white spaces, glyph shape and glyph density. The complexity of this relationship -- and how this relationship changes at different scales -- is what stands in the way of the holy grail of automated spacing.

If we could proportional track text in an optically appropriate way, we would also be able to proportionally space text automatically; indeed, we could erase the mechanical distinction between sidebearing spacing and kerning.

The other thing to note about tracking, by the way, is that all the adjustment is added to or subtracted from the advance width, i.e. to one side only of the glyph (although there may be a mirrored adjustment in RTL text in e.g. InDesign ME).</div>

Surely being able to add space linearly is one absolute proof, if it is needed, that you got the spacing (and subsequent kerning) correct in the first place. What you did (if you did it well) was make the spacing optically <em>equal</em>. Surely that is what kerning is all about, making the space between different pairs equivalent. So I work hard to get all the gaps equal to, say, 50 (units deliberately not specified). How will all the gaps look 100 if I then add 20 to one pair and 80 to another? Remember that you are simply adding 'white' in between the white extremities of glyphs. Am I making sense or have I way oversimplified it? Surely all the optical trickery is already done when you've finished kerning. There is nowhere else for tricks of the eye to hide once kerning has dealt with such tricks.

Now if you can demonstrate how added white space can look different depending on the shape of the white space it is being added to, please do so. Plus someone please show me a comparative example where variable tracking is better that linear. I'll believe it when I see it. I'll gladly be proven wrong.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Linear spacing also works with pairs such as AV because one is adding an equivalent area of spacing to the gap regardless of whether the shape of the white space is a rectangle or a parallelogram. The more complex the relationship between the kerning pair, the more parallelograms you need but the width of all the parallelograms is always equal.

Because one is adding area, the addition is always linear because the height is a constant:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HHAVOKY_4126.png]


That is not to say that white space next to black doesn't <em>appear</em> whiter and thus less is needed. I've no doubt some of you will think these red areas look different in area but I would say not significantly. Mathematically speaking at least, they are all identical in area.

Can you do a version where you switch the kerning on and add linear space (as in line 2 but kerned already) to make the line the same length? That is the one that I maintain will look best. Either way, you're gonna need the kerning switched on for a satisfactory result (even before manually adding positive percentage).

Or have I completely misunderstood? Surely one needs kerning on to fix local errors once the global spacing has been decided?

		<div class="commentbody">Craig, thanks for the examples! 

Sorry if the original post was not 100% clear! Chris is correct : I mean that the increase in space between letters ( and the word space) in tracking is not a percentage of the space between glyphs but increased in a linear and therefore constant steps.

If the space between the stems** of an n + n which for example in the type I am making now is  216+180 =396 ( I have a 2048 em).  And if the space between an o + o  is more or less* 60+60=120. From a critical point of view I know that speaking about the flats the number I have is of course not taking into account some things that do also matter like the serifs, the density of the serifs, the serifs shape, length and so on. But for the sake of having something concrete to measure from and to allow the argument be presented quickly let's pick the stem. The flat to round is a bit over 2/3 at .696 of the flat to flat. Then in rough terms this means that my round + round is about one third .333 of my flat + flat.

Of course what happens when you add to these figures in a linear manner is that their ratio to each other changes. And what i am wondering is if maintenance this ratio looks better or not.

 For me looking at the lower case is a bit more interesting because we read more of it. If I do a quick experiement I will need to try to make the net impact on line length equivalent as Craig did. Probably the way to do it is to add and subtract from the existing glyphs side spacing by a percent and then take that length and match it using tracking. Doing a negative as well as a positive would be interesting as well. I suspect it is with reduced spaces that the greater benefit would be seen if there was one.

I will post the numbers I have shortly. John, you are 100% corerect in saying "Proportional to what?". Hopefully the numbers will explain that well. However if they don't or if you think there is a better way of doing this please let me know.

Nick when you say "IMO as tracking increases, the width of the Space character should decrease." you means that as the spaces between letters get smaller the word space should also get smaller - correct? If so In Design does precisely this. I don't have Quark so so I don't know what it does. Or are you really saying that letters that are spaced wider need less word space & the opposite? Surely not.

The next step will be to post my numbers and then to do some test words.


*The extrema are at different heights but the diference is maybe 1 o 2 em so it hardly matters 

** Measuring this way is slightly arbitrary.</div>

The flaw I see in your plans (and in my experiments) is that that is the <em>distance</em> between the letters, not the <em>space</em> between the letters.</div>

Sounds like a good read. What book is this this from?


@ Job:

I briefly checked out [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kindersley|David Kindersley]] on Wikipedia and couldn't find mention of his theory. Can you direct me to where is this documented?

I think you have to get above above 5em/1000 which I think is where our sensitivity to such things probably begins before this gets interesting. My numbers don't show me where that is yet. What number do you think is relevant?

I do know that John's question of relative to what is still very relevant simply because fonts don't currently offer anything for an app to grab and manage on a percentage basis. My Percentage numbers are based on relatively easy cases. And Craig's comments address this as well. He is correct.

I am going to chew this over for another hour or so.</div>

About half of that thread Craig links to is me not understanding Kindersley, and then finally understanding him correctly, so if you look at it skip ahead to where I "get it". 

Kindersley's book, really a booklet, is called "Optical Letter Spacing". There is a third edition, published in 2001. Kindersley's stuff is very interesting, because it is a quite different approach, but was never fully worked out. His explanations are pretty confusing also. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kindersley had a quite different approach from Adobe's optical metrics program. The Adobe program is based on the Hz program developed by Hermann Zapf and URW, if I remember rightly. And it is based on the idea of 'equal area' of whites between letters and avoiding closely proximate blacks, if I've got it right. Kindersley had a quite different approach, based on the distribution of weight of the black in a letter. As several people have pointed out, most recently Kent Lew, Adobe's Optical metrics program doesn't work very well. 

An attempt was made to computerize Kindersley's approach, but it never really got off the ground, except for one brief (and impressive) test, but with a lot of ad hoc stuff being done for the test. 

Currently what seems to be better than Adobe is KernMaster from Dutch Type Library, and iKern, a program that its author, Igino Marini, is using as the basis of his kerning service to type designers. These are for the design stage, not for doing on the fly in an application. </div>

I was looking at my resources on the hz program and letter adjustment is all called kerning. There is no explanation about the math. An on the fly ikern is probably the closest thing to what I was thinking of.

Despite being utterly impractical it may be interesting to look at. But my sample will have to wait until tomorrow. </div>

That's only the tip of the problem, though, because optical spacing involves things other than inter-letter space. So even if you are able to quantify that space in a way that is meaningful and manipulable, you still have to contend with how that space is optically affected by the shape of the adjacent blacks and by letter densities. It isn't just a problem of quantifying a variable, but of too many different variables affecting each other in different ways and different amounts in different contexts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've used DTL Kernmaster a little. I'm going to try it again on a more typical text face to see if it behaves better in that situation. I tried it, with some scripting help from Karsten, during spacing of the massive Gabriola font. In the end, I replaced pretty much all the Kernmaster-generated values with manual values, but I did find the tool useful in identifying pairs that needed attention. This is actually backwards to how Kernmaster is typically used: normally one defines the pairs for the tool to look at and potentially kern, and then run the tool. Karsten's scripts made it possible for me to fire the tool at arbitrary combinations of glyphs, and then use the Kernmaster results as clues to which pairs needed kerning.</div>
