body: "In 2008 <em>TypeTogether</em> released the <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree\">Bree</a>
  typeface, a sleek sans serif that quickly became a favorite among brand and editorial
  designers.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif\">Bree Serif</a>
  follows the same theme as its predecessor. It is a young and energetic upright italic
  that approaches readers with hip and somewhat elegant charm. It has a range of styles
  that can perform as counterparts to the original <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree\">Bree</a>
  fonts. At the same time though they bring a whole range of new and individual features
  that make <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif\">Bree Serif</a> a
  separate type family in its own right.\r\n\r\nThe characters in <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif\">Bree
  Serif</a> maintain the original flavour of handwriting, but have a more subtle appearance
  to support optimal editorial usage. The slabby nature of its shapes, particularly
  in the heavier weights, makes for a strong impression.\r\n\r\nSome of the characteristic
  features of its sans serif cousin are present in <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif\">Bree
  Serif</a> too, such as the single-story \u2018a\u2019, the cursive \u2018e\u2019
  and the rhythmical \u2018k\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019. Alternate letters of these are
  also available when a more neutral look is desired.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif\">Bree
  Serif</a> offers a mixture of fluid and attractive forms that convey a contemporary
  and vivid aspect. If you loved the multi- award wining <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree\">Bree</a>,
  you will surely love its seriffed cousin!\r\n\r\nDesigned by <em>Jos\xE9 Scaglione</em>
  and <em>Veronika Burian</em>.\r\n\r\nMore information: <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif\">Bree
