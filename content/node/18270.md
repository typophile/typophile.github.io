  Something that has more personality and comtemporary attitude compared to Helvetica,
  and legible as display.\r\n\r\nmy project is targeted toward a youth and young adult
  audience, so you get the idea\r\n\r\ncan you guys suggest me a list.\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: Oh yeah, If it's possible, if it can work with Quadraat serif, it would be
    great. This is what I have so far. I find the quadraat sans condensed  too rigid.
    I am looking for a replacement for that. Anybody have suggestions? or is quadraat
    sans fine, the way it is?

    body: I think slightly, but not comical. Do you know any other helvetica-like
      typefaces? Thanks
