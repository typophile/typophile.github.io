<p>When I look back at them some are better than others but we all learn over time.  Anyway, I&rsquo;m trying to get a bit more serious about things these days, and I&rsquo;d be interested to hear people&rsquo;s thoughts on my latest project, a modern serif face called &lsquo;Fleete&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>These images seem strangely soft. Why is that?</p>
<p>Your examples of use are book oriented. I am not sure this is the best application for your font as it has been designed so far. It seems more like a display face. If you are in earnest about it being a book face that would color my comments quite a bit. So I would like to ask you about this distinction first.</p>

Yes, if you fix your image you can have better comments, and if you want comments on the curves you can upload vector graphics.

<p>The softness comes from my having printed hard copy specimens, and then scanned them-I thought this would give a result more representative of the face in use.  On reflction a silly idea, I shall post some better images shortly.  I&rsquo;ll also see about some vector graphics too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am finding the bulb at the right bottom of the e distracts me. I would reduce it. The upper right of the e seems too light. The gap produced by the very long arm of the r is also distracting. The c seems to closed. I think the tail of the y might benefit from having a more substantial and definitive finnish such as a bulb end. The same advice for the g.  The dot on the i is too light. The s is a nice design but for a different font. I don&rsquo;t think it works here. The ends of the z are too light and disappear. I would look at a deeper join for your n and m. Why are the strokes of the n,m,u having on the first vertical stroke be heavy and lighter afterwards? The u should not be a rotated n.</p>
<p>Overall look at the characters and notice that some are far heavier than the others. Look at how other fonts are not like this and how they achieve and even emphasis from letter to letter. Example w vs, x</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cuttlefish- I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was modular in a formal sense, but it is true that I&rsquo;ve tried to keep similar curves across the different characters where they were appliable-maybe tried a bit too hard in a fee cases, as Eben picked up. :)</p>
<p>I just had a look at our Rutager and Rutabon- I can see the similarity you refer to, though aspects of them in turn remin d me of an old creation of mine &ldquo;Cleaver&rsquo;s Juvenia&rdquo;, which was derived from the face in a 19th century soap advertisment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello, I like the general feel to it, also I did like your book-like specimen in the beginning (though it&rsquo;s definitely not a face for a whole novel, for one or two pages, even in bread it could be nice). It definitely has a 19th century feel to it.</p>
<p>I disliked the m,n,u, as it was noted by Eben already. I disliked the original g, missing the upper part of the right stem. It looks like an old &ldquo;con-&rdquo; or &ldquo;-us&rdquo; abbreviature instead of a g. I preferred the original g to the one with the bulb ending the stroke.</p>
<p>I really like the &ldquo;t&rdquo;! I always wished to design a high-t, but most of the time failed to get it to harmonise with the other letters, due to the top serif issue. Nice!</p>
