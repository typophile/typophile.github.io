body: This was done a year ago by a designer who has moved on. The Mac he worked on
  has been upgraded, and fonts added or replaced. We thought he was using Copperplate,
  but I can find no completely "sans" versions. The "O" makes me think Eurostile,
  but the "R" is wrong. Anyone have a thought?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leftbanner.jpg]

    body: Okay, but... was the S worked over a little? The ends are normally cut off
      at around a 30 degree angle instead of being parallel to the baseline.

      body: Sorry- I wish I could say; but you're correct. For an exact match, we'd
        need to trim the "S". On my monitor, the ends of the stroke appear like a
        "tail" more than a straight angel cut. Possibly it was "cleaned up" in an
        over zealous optimization process.
