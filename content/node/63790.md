  was fine until suddenly our beloved Fontlab started exporting the font corrupted.
  It makes some characters appear and reappear when I use it in indesign.\r\n\r\nMy
  encodings are corrected coz I have used it before, and had no problem.\r\n\r\nWould
  anyone by any chance know what's going on and how can I solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in Advance"

    if you can strip the offending portion of code.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort, you could
    export your vectors and then re-import them, and then re-do all the info and metrics.\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe it is the format. Have you tried generating different formats?\r\n\r\nWhile
    it's true that your font \"works\", it sounds like it has a bug."

    some glyphs are showing up blank, this often indicates a problem with the interaction
    between your hinting and the start-point of your paths. Try relocating all start-points
    to the bottom left-hand corner and then rehinting the font.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Hey guys,\r\nThanks for your suggestions,\r\nIt turns out since the font
    is a kind of pixel font, I had to uncheck the \"use subroutines to compress outlines
    in the CFF table\" from the preferences panel. Don't ask why :S\r\n\r\nA friend
    had the same problem once...\r\n\r\nAnyways \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nKj"
