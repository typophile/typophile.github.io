body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI need to create a document that has both English and Japanese translation.
  When I select text in Illustrator and choose one of OSX's, e.g., Hiragino Kaku,
  Hiragino Maru (which, incidentally, show up as Kanji in Ill's Character Pallette,
  I just get English letterforms.\r\n\r\nI tried installing the Japanese \"Language
  Translations\" from the system CD to no avail. I think all tha does is allow you
  to run OSX in that language.\r\n\r\nThis is driving me plum crazy. Any else solved
  this? The fonts show up in FontBook, Textedit, etc., but don't apply when chosen.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n
