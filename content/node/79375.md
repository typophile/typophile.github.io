body: "hi,\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get some feedback on this logo for a web based legal
  services provider. \r\n\r\nSpecifically - whether the rotated A breaks the wordmark
  too much, and any thoughts regarding the spacing, negative arrow. Or anything else
  that comes to mind for that matter. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/il001_5409.jpg]"

  body: "As soon as i saw this i read 'ILEGAL' - which i imagine is undesirable. I
    suspect that this is either because of the IL alignment or the rotated A breaking
    the instant into INST which my mind then dismisses as a non-word.\r\n\r\nWil"

    with that issue - maybe I''ll have another look. '

  body: I find the sideways A distracting. Basically I look at that, wondering what
    it is, and I don't read the rest. I see the arrow, but I also see a stapler, hole
    punch and a bulldog clip, plus an arrow doesn't mean "instant" to me.

    the only thing that really bothers me is the round type."

  body: Thanks for the feedback so far. The round typeface is a stated preference
    of the client, who wants something vaguely informal/relaxed/web2.0-ish. This is
    the colour palette I'm leaning towards (pretty obvious, but green for instant
    - something more serious for legal). Cheers. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/il002_4563.jpg]

  body: "Purely aesthetically, the tiny stem of the arrow in the A bothers me - it's
    very thin compared to the rest of the counter space. Have you considered removing
    the crossbar entirely, for an even more web-2.0-ey play button effect?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    does the \"LTD\" have to be there?"

    stem is quite narrow - more so on the reversed version. Will look at that. Cheers. '

  body: slight update based on Birdseeding's comment. Removing the crossbar completely
    makes it look too much like the morethan logo, if you know what that looks like.
    Now that I've thought about morethan it won't go away.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/il003_5567.jpg]

  body: "Better! You might want to do separate versions for positive and negative
    space that optically look the same, that's how the big agencies do it.\r\n\r\nStill
    unsure about the arrow stem, it's the sharp edges (as opposed to the soft ones
    elsewhere) that bother my eyes a bit too, and it's still narrower than the aperture
    of the G and S. Not sure anything sensible can be done about that, except possibly
    move the crossbar down (ie. left) a bit and widening the gap even more. Or removing
    the gap altogether, it can still be an arrow I guess. Not convinced either will
    work. :)"

  body: "The arrow is a clever idea, but it's rather tiny and at first I just read
    it as an odd, sidewise A. \r\n\r\nMaybe if there was a way to make the arrow more
    prominent, like doing it in a different color or something."

  body: "why not leave the A upright? You can still have the arrow. Im not sure a
    right point arrow says \"instant\" anymore than an upward point arrow does.\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe just the arrow head pointing right inside the upright A. It would look different
    enough to notice but not so different it stops looking like an \"A\".\r\n\r\n"
