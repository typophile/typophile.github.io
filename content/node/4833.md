body: Hello all, <BR>First I would like to introduce myself as the newest member in
  this forum or the rookie <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>I am counting on the expertise of a lot of members here
  to find an answer to my problem. <BR>I am a graphic designer, just switched to a
  PC, I finally converted the postcript fonts and will be using ATM light to turn
  them on/off. <BR>This is where I get confused, I realized I have more than 300 fonts
  installed in WindowsXP, from what I understand it shouldn&#39;t be more that 200
  or the system may run a little slow. I am thinking about converting most of them
  to type1 and manage them through ATM, But I don&#39;t know witch ones are system
  fonts, and have to be managed by windows. <BR>Please help. <BR>Thank you.

    wanting to fix it I ended up posting the thread twice. <BR>I am sorry!

  body: There are plenty of critical system fonts that are TrueType fonts &#40;.ttf&#41;.
    I wouldn&#39;t touch Tahoma, for instance. <BR> <BR>Additionally, I don&#39;t
    know anybody who thinks it is sensible to convert Windows system fonts to Type
    1. Why on earth would one do such a thing? You&#39;d break the extended language
    support and the TrueType hinting. In any case, it is not permitted under the Windows
    license. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t find the list of Windows system fonts, although
    I know it&#39;s on the MS web site. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Steve, thanks for the hint, I noticed the .FON have a different looking icon.
    <BR> <BR>Thomas, I want to make sure I don&#39;t mess with the system fonts, and
    convert the rest to type1 so I can manage them with ATM light, and not have them
    slow down my system. <BR> <BR>Thank you guys for the feedback, please keep it
    coming.

  body: ATM Light doesn&#39;t really &#34;manage fonts&#34; in the sense of turning
    them on and off and handling sets. For that you need ATM Deluxe &#40;or one of
    its competitors&#41;. ATM Light just provides rasterization services, and most
    of that is now build into the OS &#40;except for multiple master support&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Changing the format of the font won&#39;t help system performance. For
    that you need to deactivate some fonts, which you can do just as easily regardless
    of font format. <BR> <BR>These days Windows can handle having hundreds or even
    thousands of active fonts. The main thing that gets slowed down is that certain
    applications enumerate all the fonts when the app is launched. Plus anything with
    a WYSIWYG font menu may have some extra work to do. But all this is pretty much
    linear; there&#39;s no magic number where things suddenly get much worse. 300
    fonts isn&#39;t that much worse than 200. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: It seems that I neglected some parameters. let me restructure my question.
    <BR>I have two collections of fonts tha came with some clip arts. True Type, and
    Postcript, about 1000 fonts each. <BR>What/how would be the best way for me to
    use these fonts. &#40;windowsXP&#41; photoshop, illustrator, quark, dreamweaver...

- body: If &#40;cough, cough&#41; there&#39;s any worth keeping, only install those.
    Then with ATM Deluxe or Suitcase you can turn them on and off individually. <BR>With
    dreamweaver, you won&#39;t be using fonts other than system fonts or default sans
    or serifs, unless there&#39;s something I don&#39;t know about. Nobody will be
    able to see anything else, unless they have the same font installed and active.
    <BR>Atm deluxe can handle both ttf &amp; ps. Also, if you need type reunion, it
    comes bundled with atm deluxe.  <BR>I&#39;m not sure atm light handles ttf, and
    if it does, deluxe isn&#39;t so expensive anyways. And, like Thomas said, windows
    rasterizes most everything already. <BR> <BR> <BR>
