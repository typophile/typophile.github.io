body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letters_6281.jpg]\r\nNeed some help with
  the ID of this font please, I am a type teacher and am teaching students about fonts
  and how to make them as an exercise and one of my students submitted this as a final
  font and I'd like to know if this looks familiar to anyone? Seems to be a condesned
  version of Helvetica but I could really use an expert eye.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    make me think this is original work. But it does seem like an \"interpretation\"
