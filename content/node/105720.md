  this work and now they need the logo re-created in vector format. The font I am
  looking for is the \"Jokers Corner\" title. This looks like a western or perhaps
  carnival type. Does anyone know what font this could be?\r\n\r\nThank you for any
  input that will get me closer to finding this font."

    Boston Truckstyle</a>. If a J with a spike on the bottom is not included as an
    alternate, it's easy to add the spike.\r\nDon"

  body: "Found the J with the spike. It's actually a lowercase j, at least in the
    old version that I have had for many years.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LHFBostonTruckstyleLC_InUse_4486.jpg]\r\nSo
    you can use the lowercase without any editing of the letterforms.\r\nDon"
