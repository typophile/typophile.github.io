    the spiked glyphs wouldn&#39;t align in Illustrator. '

  body: ' John, the spiked stencil, now you&#39;ve outdone yourself. Never seen anything
    like it. However, I like the bottom ones &#40;Rounded and Grungy&#41; better than
    the spiked ones. Can we see more of those? The spiked ones might work for a zoo
    exhibit or a World&#39;s Longest Fingernail Competition. Have you tried a setting?
    <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>Also, a quick way to align these...use the nudge arrows.
    You can set the values using control-k, then nudge them to a guide or a snap-to
    grid. Quick and painless. If you use the open arrow or open lasso tools to select
    specific points, the nudge will also help you move your points around to experiement
    or to precisely align. '

  body: ' In the Grungy version, I would suggest rounding the top right of the J,
    rounding the upper left and lower right corner of the O, and rounding the lower
    right corner of the Y. <BR> <BR>The rounded version doesn&#39;t feel as unique
    to me as your other versions - Get more expressive with it and experiment, it
    may become something amazing. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: your type here reminds me of some of my experiments, which have yet to be
    posted here &#40;i&#39;m fairly new&#41;  <BR>regarding your 14.sep posting of
    &#39;rounded&#39;, i feel that the Q is handled very well &#40;you&#39;re aware
    that there is no Q in the grungy set&#41; <BR>the character which is bothering
    me in the rounded set &#40;actually both sets&#41; is the K. there is nothing
    round about it, and it feels like an R to me. maybe add your round treatment on
    the upward right corner of the bowl... <BR>another problematic letter in the rounded
    set

  body: ' Q problem - perhaps the spike darts out from the center and not on the side.
    i.e. instead of it being a crazy serif its actually involved in the letterform.
    <BR> <BR>with the roundy knobs version replace spike for roundy knob facing up.
    <BR> <BR>Grundgy Q is just fine - you&#39;ve utilized the corner shape consistently
    such as G, S R, 5 and 6. but I think you forgot to break off the stroke on the
    R...the rest do. <BR> <BR>X - umm, perhaps use up the full grid there and make
    the 2 splits along the same lines as your O - you&#39;ll get a nice mini x in
    the middle eh? '
