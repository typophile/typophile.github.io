body: "Wondering if any art directors have advice on what its like, how to best become
  and typical duties of an Art Director. I have wanted to be a creative director or
  art director for some time and have been told that I am already doing what they
  do(as a designer, teacher - and on a below designer salary!) but wondered if there
  is any advice out there. Topics that would be helpful would be Salary, Duties, Skills,
  work styles, etc.\r\n\r\nSome back history on me if it helps:\r\n\r\nI'm a Graphic
  Designer, Illustrator and Instructor of Advertising Design, Photoshop, Illustrator
  and other technical and theory based class for a local college.  \r\n\r\nI've worked
  in the field for 7+ years as a designer/illustrator and a teacher for 4+. I only
  have an AS degree, have won numerous awards and have a portfolio of work spanning
  companies like Disney to the University of Florida.\r\n\r\nManaging and leading
  is a strong suite for me and i think the experience i've gained over the years puts
  me right where i need to be but always felt that having a degree was required...
  Now that i've found out its not... and have been approached.. can anyone tell me
  what i'm instore for?"

  body: "Tough question.\r\n\r\nI've been a designer for well over two decades (is
    it three now?), and i can honestly tell you that i have yet to encounter two workplaces
    that share the same definition of \"Art Director\" or \"Creative Director\". \r\n\r\nSpeaking
    generally, one would expect an art director to \"direct\" -- to move the work/design/concepts
    forward with his/her own vision... and that almost NEVER happens! EVERYBODY's
    an art director these days, especially with the advanced tools/software so available,
    so it is next to IMPOSSIBLE to call the shots -- unless you're lucky enough to
    have superiors that trust what you think and stay the h*ll out of your way. Otherwise,
    become a CEO or something, and tell the Art Director you hire how to do HIS job.\r\n\r\nA
    lot of people get hung up on titles, but I've never really given them much stock,
    other than how they reflect on salary. For several years, I was Creative Director
    of a shop in L.A., then became a full-fledged Partner, but the shop folded and
    now I'm at a new studio labelled as a \"Senior Designer\"... there is no higher
    position in this group, because the owner/CEO is the high poobah and the final
    say in all creative (other than the client, of course). His brief attempt to install
    a Creative Director to take up his lack of time was a disaster, because they never
    agreed on anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    they are about the same. '

  body: "What Scott says is accurate based on my experience as well. For me, an \u201Cart
    director\u201D should really just be another competent designer to bounce my ideas
    off of and brainstorm with. Depending on how big the firm is, an art director
    can also be the one responsible for communicating creative strategy with the client.
    But in my experience, the lines between role of art director/creative director/senior
    designer are often quite blurry."

  body: What if you spend half your time in meetings talking about design, half your
    time in front of the computer doing the design, and half your time writing copy
    to go with the design? Wait ... is that 150% of your time? Sounds about right.

  body: "I would add to Scott's assessment, that people make the job their own.\r\nIn
    other words, different people do the same job different ways.\r\nThat's particularly
    true of art direction, where people can come to the same job from different backgrounds,
    with different ways of working. \r\nFor instance, you may be inclined to illustrate
    a piece yourself, whereas another AD would choose from illustrators they've worked
    with before. Or prefer photography over illustration. Some may use Helvetica for
    everything, others gotta have a new face for each project."

  body: "hello\r\n\r\nMy experience is similar to Scott's, I have been a Senior Designer,
    Head of Design and Art Director - there has not been much difference between the
    roles and as Scott has already said, different agencies/businesses have different
    interpretations of what an Art Director is.\r\n\r\nMy only comment would be that
    as an Art Director there is much more emphasis on 'team leading', knowing how
    to get the best out of your designers, how to motivate them, provide inspiration
    etc. I have only worked for small agencies, I have no idea how large agencies
    with fluid design teams define the role of an art director, but as Nick has said
    most people make the job their own - just be upfront about how you would approach
    the job."
