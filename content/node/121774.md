  It's a kind of Monospace / Fixed Width font, but has several special thingies, like
  the dots in the \"\xDC\" (yes, I'm German). Anyone can help? Thanks!"

    body: Thank you! I've stumbled across Bennu Sans myself (amongst several others),
      but I guess I need the exact font (notice also the "A" and the strike-though
      zero).
