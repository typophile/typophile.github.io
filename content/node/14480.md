  body: Thanks for the amazingly fast reply. The big question now is which package
    or individual styles to buy. Soooo many choices. :-)

  body: Hrant's legendary 1 minute I.D. actually was the first one, but since then
    -- with e-mail notification helping -- a couple of people have beaten that record.
    Unfortunately, now that e-mail notification has disappeared from Typophile, we've
    fallen way behind again. I'm bugging the Punchut Boys to reinstate e-mail notification
    just for the Type Identification Board so we can have some serious competition
    again.
