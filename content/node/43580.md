  speakers, etc. \u2013 and I'm looking for examples of vintage audio typography.
  Any thoughts on specific typefaces and/or places I could find a stockpile of examples
  (outside of your standard Google search)?"

  body: "[APPLAUSE FILTERS IN FROM AUDITORIUM]\r\n\r\nSounds good to me. You see a
    trend for sure. Slightly modified sans with some veneer of modernity. Is that
    Eurostyle under the Creek mark? It is an industry ruled by engineers and geeks
    obviously highly influenced by electrical diagrams."
