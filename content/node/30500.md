  body: "I also had the feeling that it was a Zapf typeface, but the lowercase 'a'
    looks considerably different than Palatino. At least the version I know... Maybe
    some customised version?\r\n"

  body: "The Swiss magazine <a href=\"http://www.dumag.ch/heft.php\">\xABDU\xBB</a>
    doesn\u2019t use a Palatino, but several versions of Bram de Does\u2019 beautiful
    <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/lexicon/lexicon.html\">Lexicon</a>. If you
    know German: There has been a thread going on about the subject in the German
    <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?t=2205&highlight=lexicon\">typoforum</a>.\r\n\r\n\xABDU\xBB,
    or some of the issues anyway, belongs in my opinion to one of the finest magazines
    ever. "

  body: Well, we're <em>definitely</em> not looking at Lexicon, but at a version of
    Palatino. Except for the slightly different lc 'a' all the other earmarks are
    there.

  body: "Sorry, I was so excited that \xABDU\xBB has been mentioned that I didn\u2019t
    even have a look at the sample. Indeed, this doesn\u2019t look like Lexicon \u2013
    which is used however in every variant throughout \xABDU\xBB. Mixing Lexicon with
    some Palatino seems a strange choice to me \u2026"

  body: Du uses Lexicon for the text, the one i posted for the headings. Is there
    different versions of Palatino at all?

  body: "Palatino is known for having numerous knock-offs, even some created by Zapf
    himself. It could also be a custom type created for the magazine. My suggestion
    would be to contact them.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Now that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told: It is indeed a customized version
    of \xABPalatino\xBB, appropriately named <strong>DU-serif</strong>, which apparently
    should be revised again soon."
