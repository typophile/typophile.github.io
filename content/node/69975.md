body: "An experiment in satire expressed through typographic style. This recent quote
  from a Muslim cleric seemed custom made for the format of a Wild West wanted poster.
  I based the typography on actual fonts from old posters and contemporary wood-type
  fonts, but rendered it in walnut ink, then added my own faux Asian-Farsee brush
  calligraphy. Apologies to the purists, at least the text is exact, as lifted from
  one of the many inexact translations available at online news sites and on the crumpled
  up front page of the Times at my local coffee shop.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WomenWhoLR_4131.jpg]"

  body: "Such silliness indeed deserves mockery.\r\n\r\nOne hopes, however, that most
    Muslims - even most Shia Muslims - in fact have more sense than to esteem that
    particular cleric.\r\n\r\nFor an unrelated reason - because I wanted to know of
    the source of a quote - I happened to hunt up information about a Muslim woman
    of the early eleventh century who would have been a seismic risk by this standard:
    Wallada bint al-Mustakfi."

  body: 'Thank you for the research. I had never heard of Wallada bint al-Mustakfi
    and her story is amazing. She even has her own Facebook page, although only two
    people willing to publicly acknowledge they "like" her:). '

    -wise but remains elegant stylistically.\r\n\r\nWhat's 'walnut ink'?"

  body: Walnut ink is I think made from actual walnuts (some alchemy-mashup there,
    maybe they put it in a wine press??).It is a dark rich brown that puddles like
    watercolor.
