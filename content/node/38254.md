body: I am a typography student interested in contacting [[Akira Kobayashi]] and finding
  articles or books with/by him. I have attempted to contact him through his Linotype
  email, but after a week of no reply I'm getting very anxious. Any help, clues, or
  anything would be greatly appreciated.

    okay. Do you have a telephone? Even if the receptionist won't patch you through
    you'll be able to find out if he's on vacation or otherwise indisposed. "

  body: "Thanks for the quick replies. I have had trouble finding any means other
    than email to contact Kobayashi, so I am waiting solely on an email I sent him
    at his work. I'm just worried he'll miss it or something like that.\r\n\r\nAny
    other means of contacting him would certainly be welcome."

  body: "Dustin, Akira is a generous and kind man who isn't likely to intentionally
    ignore anyone. He does travel frequently, and may be away from the office right
    now. I know that some of his colleagues are away, so he may be at the same event.\r\n\r\nYou
    can call the Linotype offices - the phone number is on their website: http://www.linotype.com/53/contactdetails.html\r\n\r\nThey
    have normal business hours in their time zone, so keep that in mind when you call.
    You should be able to find out Akira's availability when you call.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with everything."

  body: "Dustin,\r\nI've heard Akira is coming to Japan on business trip for the seminar
    of Tokyo Type Directors Club and Tama Art Univ.\r\nThe seminar will be held in
    October 29. so maybe he will stay in Japan till the end of this month. I guess
    he can't respond while he is on the trip. Did you get Lino's auto reply? I'm sure
    he will answer your email after he will be back to his office."
