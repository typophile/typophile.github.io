  When I noticed the [[digraph|Digraphs]]. This was fascinating because it related
  so well & was yet different than the earlier Ligature thread. The digraph we all
  probably know best is 'IJ' used in Dutch. Whenever I have seen it it just looked
  'right'. But apparently there is also 'ch' 'll' and 'rr' in Spanish, 'ch' in Czech,
  'dz',  'ch',  'lj', and 'nj' in Croat, and many more. I will provide a full list
  later perhaps. Some of these seem like they would set less well in the same space.
  \ In a monospace they nearly all stick out like a sore thumb despite the consumate
  expertise of Peter Bi\u013Eak. In a less constrained design they might be really
  lovely. But maybe not. Maybe their compression is part of their identity. My question
  is, how seriously does anybody take these anymore & why? Please enlighten me.\r\n\r\nBTW,
  this is what <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/site/font_features.php?family_id=5&id=58>Peter
  says</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>Digraphs</strong>\r\nSome languages (e.g. Czech,
  Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Slovak, or Spanish) use two
  characters to represent a single phoneme; those double characters (dz, ij, ch) are
  called digraphs.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Digraphs are treated as single \u2018letters\u2019
  on their own right. They influence hyphenation, abbreviation, and alphabetic order.
  Digraphs function as letters for the purposes of sorting e.g. in Czech, Slovak,
  Spanish and Welsh \u2018ch\u2019 serves as a single unit and words beginning with
  \u2018ch\u2019 have their own section in a dictionary.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Digraphs
  should not be confused with ligatures which are graphically stylized combinations
  of two or more letters. Whilst some ligatures indicate that successive sounds are
  to be pronounced as one (\xE6,\u0153) most of them are just typographical letter-combination,
  trying to improve a appearance of the words and eliminate possibly conflicting characters
  pairs (ff, fi, fl, ffi, fl). Those ligatures have a practical significance only
  for typesetting, and do not represents a semantic difference.</cite>"

    necessary to modify the standard \"ae\" and \"oe\" digraphs, to make them slightly
    narrower than just merging their components. And it's especially important to
    make a distinction between these characters in italic. Why? -- because that's
    the way the old guys did it, and because it's smart alec stuff. And of course,
    it improves readability by disambiguation and more harmonious proportions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caesar_4908.png]\r\nBut

    so far: speaking from the point of view of a text face or even directional signage
    point of view we have:\r\n\r\n- Digraphs which (maybe) should look obtrusively
    compressed like 'rr' 'ch' & 'dz' so that their status as a digraph is reinforced\r\n\r\n-
    Digraphs which (maybe) should not be obtrusively compressed like 'ij' and which
    a layperson would ideally not notice.\r\n\r\n- Ligature/Digraphs which inevitably
    seem to be compressed like 'ae' but which (maybe) aught to look as natural as
    possible despite certain inherent difficulties in acheiving this.\r\n\r\n- Ligatures
    which probably aught too look as 'natural' or unobstrusive as possible like 'ff'
    'fi' 'fl' 'ct' & 'ffi' etc and which a layperson would ideally not notice.\r\n\r\nIs
    a structure like this accurate? If so, which digraphs fall into which camps?\r\n\r\nAdam,
    given what you said about the 'ae' and your notes about the polish vs. french
    'acute' it strikes me that there might be cultural preference for the design of
    digraphs too. What do you think? \r\n\r\n"

    off, seems like by definition a glyph like \"\xE6\" can be defined as both a digraph
    AND a ligature.\r\nBut for most digraphs: ij, ch, \xDF, its a matter of phonetics.
    An \"fl\" ligature is still two sounds in one breath while \"ij\" is simply \"\u012B\"
    (as far as one syllable). Sure \"fl\" is one syllable as well but it seems like
    its more a matter of aesthetic congestion of ascenders that the two letters compromise
    into one.\r\n...I'm really just thinking this through rather than proving anything
    at all.\r\n\r\nSo then would diacritical glyphs be labeled as digraphs? Seems
    like most of them derived from two characters mashed into one and then simplified
    to a small mark above (or below) the original character. (see: a\u0364)\r\n\r\nIs

  body: "Matt: <em>But for most digraphs ... its a matter of phonetics.</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    this is key to understanding the role of digraphs in orthography. Some languages
    treat some digraphs as distinct letters for sorting purposes, but that shouldn't
    be taken as a defining aspect of digraphs. English has many digraphs, but does
    not treat any of them as distinct letters (nor does it pronounce them consistenty).\r\n\r\nDon't
    forget trigraphs and tetragraphs, which are relatively common in some orthographies.
    Some Irish dialects pronounce up to six letters as a single phoneme.\r\n\r\nOther
    than those digraphs that have morphed into ligated forms, e.g. \xE6 or fraktur
    ck, or that have a history of either ligation or other stylised treatment in display
    letters, e.g. Dutch ij, I don't think it is either possible or desirable to given
    special typographic treatment to digraphs, trigraphs, etc. There are simply too
    many variables of use in actual languages, such that the same combination of letters
    may constitute a digraph in some words but not in others."

  body: "<cite>how seriously does anybody take these anymore & why?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    think there is no one answer to this - in some languages, the digraphs used in
    the language are still taken very seriously, and in other languages, they are
    largely ignored and disused.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think a threefold distinction is needed
    - there are digraphs like the Dutch ij, there are ligatures like the English ffi,
    and then the ae and oe ligatures are treated as orthographically distinct objects
    even in English - yes, you can spell encyclopedia as encyclop\xE6dia or as encyclopaedia,
    but that's because \xE6, being distinct from \"ae\", can be rendered alternatively
    as <em>either</em> ae or just e, not just the former choice.\r\n\r\nSo when something
    is both a digraph and a ligature, it's really a distinct letter, but with visible
    parentage. The German eszet is perhaps further along in the process than some,
    as it is not perceived much as its historical value of a ligature of two letters
    \"s\", the first being a long s, but instead is often just thought of as another
    letter, even if it doesn't currently have a matching upper case."

  body: "I might have overlooked an excellent explanation, but I must say I still
    don't see the logic in considering \xE6 to be a ligature.\r\n\r\nAlso, I realize
    I'm not familiar with most of the digraphs and in fact I don't understand the
    need for most of them. It might be that to which extent you can grasp the logic
    behind these characters depends on the language you speak. For example, I don't
    see the logic behind digraphs such as LL, LJ, SS and RR at all, However, I do
    understand /sz. That's a distinct sound so a digraph seems logical. /cz and /rz
    are taking it too far again, but I suppose if I were Polish I could see the logic
    behind them.\r\n\r\nI'm Dutch and to be honest I try to avoid designing a special
    digraph character of /ij, but in many cases I still do to improve spacing. I tend
    to design an obvious digraph for display typefaces, but for text faces I tend
    to treat it as a contextual alternate. For example, I just designed a typeface
    called Zwartika (which is essentially Helvetica Ultra Black) for a school project
    and considering the descender of /j doesn't fit underneath /i without extending
    the descender to an undesirable depth, I get into trouble with these characters
    \u2014 especially if you apply an outline to the font, as it will look like /j
    is on top of /i. In order to fix this I added an alternate for /j with a condensed
    tail, rather than making a special digraph. For the capital letters I added an
    alternate /J with a vertical cut and a distinct digraph as well, as Zwartika is
    meant to be used for display purposes. For general reading I would recommend the
    alternate /J rather than the digraph.\r\n\r\nI find most of the digraphs shown
    here to be too obtrusive. In fact I feel \xE6 and \u0153 are often pushing it,
    though I accept them for their historical value and because I do like the texture,
    particularly in serif fonts. The monospace digraphs ebensorkin showed are absolutely
    horrendous to me. I feel a monospace /m is already uncomfortable, so putting two
    letters in the same space is unacceptable to me. I guess some languages insist
    on those digraphs. Can anyone who speaks languages where such digraphs are common
    tell me if they're required? For the monospace typeface shown, would it be lacking
    without the digraphs or wouldn't it matter either way? How does the function of
    the digraph and the spacing you have to sacrifice relate?"

    it obviously <em>is</em> a ligature - it is the two letters, a and e, combined
    into a single linked graphical element.\r\n\r\nYou are right that it's nothing
    like the ffi ligature - the two letters are joined because they form an orthographical
    entity, not just for appearance reasons. But English speakers basically don't
    recognize the \"digraph\" as a concept applicable to their language. Instead,
    a digraph is just any two letters - what the Playfair cipher encodes.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.quadibloc.com/crypto/pp1321.htm]]\r\n\r\nSo
    the only word they <em>have</em> for it is \"ligature\", even though it is definitely
    not a ligature in the sense you are using the term."

  body: "I have to admit I use my own terms or use terms in a way I feel are more
    applicable at times. Sometimes I forget and I get into trouble. But really, shouldn't
    there be a great distinction? The way I reason it, a digraph is a combination
    of letters that denote a specific sound and could in some sense be considered
    a separate letter. Sometimes that's what it does become eventually. The Dutch
    generally don't recognize /ij as part of the alphabet, and yet we often refer
    to it as a letter and I've seen game shows where it's used as a single letter
    rather than two letters. If a word starts with /ij then both letters become uppercase
    rather than just the /I.\r\n\r\nA ligature however usually seems to have little
    to do with pronunciation or considering it to be part of the alphabet. Ligatures
    are stylistic combinations of letters. According to my reasoning the Eszett came
    from a digraph and not from a ligature. The principle of a ligature is at play
    here however, at the point where the digraph starts morphing into a new letter.
    sz I would consider a digraph while the stylistic representation of sz in its
    transitional form between the digraph and \xDF could be considered a ligature.
    Same goes for ss. While ss is a digraph, long s/s is a ligature to me, which one
    day could have become a letter.\r\n\r\nConsidering every combination of letters
    to be ligatures seems much too broad to me.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>But English speakers
    basically don't recognize the \"digraph\" as a concept applicable to their language.</blockquote>\r\nThat
    seems besides the point. They should still use the term even if it's not applicable

    point clear. Yes, English speakers, when discussing the typography of other languages,
    should definitely distinguish concepts applicable to those languages, even if
    they have no counterpart in English. You are quite correct to say that.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem, instead, is that terms for things they don't normally have occasion to
    talk about will be part of a specialist vocabulary. Yes, \"\xE6\" is - or was
    - used in English-language typography, but for words derived from Latin. So the
    word \"digraph\", in the sense you're using it, isn't really part of the English
    language - the word \"ligature\" is the only one handy.\r\n\r\nThat it happens
    to mean both ligatures that are purely visible, and ligatures that are phonetic,
    is simply glossed over. After all, in Japanese, the same word serves for \"inhale\"
    and \"gobble\" or \"wolf down\". In both English and French, the same word means
    \"look at carefully\" and \"wristwatch\" (watch, montre)."
