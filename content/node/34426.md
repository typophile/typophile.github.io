  primarily to military affiliated organizations and universities.  Five by Five is
  military jargon (WW II) meaning \"loud and clear\".  My goal with the attached wordmark
  (logo) was to create something that is firm in tradition (balance and symmetry)
  but comes across as contemporary and modern.  \r\n\r\nI am looking to get some professional
  feedback on this wordmark and any input or suggestions that anyone may have.  Thank
  you for submitting any comments."

  body: "I feel most people will read, \"SIVE BY SIVE.\" Plus, this solution is not
    unique. We've all seen it before: 3hree, SE7EN, etc. Using numerals in place of
    the first letter of the word doesn't necessarily say anything about your design
    company. At least nothing which I can discern. \r\n\r\nI also see your choice
    of typeface as somewhat tech-inspired. I don't quite get \"firm in tradition,\"
    especially since the mark is less than perfectly readable. The weight of the face
    seems a bit weak to be considered firm in tradition. \r\n\r\nThis is only one
    opinion and I'm trying only to be helpful so please consider my remarks as food
    for thought. Somebody else may come along and say you're spot-on."

  body: "I agree it reads \"SIVE BY SIVE\"... And font choice makes it look more like
    a design company for digital media. If the \"design\" would be green I would say:
    \"ok this is air traffic control company.\"\r\n\r\nJust an idea: why not play
    with type. If \"five by five\" is \"loud and clear\", then make type say that.
    Emphasize LOUD and polish/sharpen the CLEAR. You can add design underneath or
    sideways as it's now (great solution for different brands to change \"design\"
    to brand names, but you're not having products to use that), because it's just
    an addition to the primary jargon saying."

  body: "Well it's hardly 'loud' or 'clear'. And it doesn't really appear 'firm in
    tradition' of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe vertical line has no connection to the matrix
    that forms the letters.\r\n\r\nMaybe add a corpse. The military like those :-/"

  body: "Hey Terrance, \r\n\r\nIf anything, the font choice reminds me of stitches
    on a cotton material, not very design or military in my opinion. Also, why don't
    you explore the use of the numbers a little more? The 7-eleven logo and 24seven
    spring to mind. A mix of numerals and text... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Paletten_3793.jpg]\r\n\r\nGood
    luck and looking forward to any other ideas you come up with. "

  body: "What about a logotype that read...\r\n\r\n[5X5]\r\n\r\n...with or without
    the square brackets and possibly in a stencil font. The stencil font route may
    be too predictable though.\r\n\r\nThen back it up with the company name in full
    and set in a clear and simple font where necessary."
