  body: "The closest to Face Photosetting's Stack is the font by Bright Ideas called
    Staxx, which was found by Ryuk.\r\nLike Stack, Staxx has three layers, a shaded
    effect, and sharp corners. Stroke thickness and spacing between stacks are similar.
    Letter-forms for the capital letters are generally similar but the numbers are
    quite different. Major differences in the capital letters include  the lack of
    a spur on _G_, angled instead of horizontal terminals on _S_, the curved stroke
    and terminal angles on _C_ and _G_, and the bottom stroke on _J_.\r\nComparison
    was made to the Stack specimen in my Letraset Product Manual. See the scan I posted
    in http://typophile.com/node/107360\r\nUnfortunately, Staxx is unusable for commercial
    purposes because it is an orphan font by a defunct company, and there does not
    seem to be any legal owner of the intellectual property in its digital fonts.\r\nDon"

title: I think the types used for the logo were originally presstypes from Letraset
  around 1974.Color tint added much later. Can anybody identify the fonts (or something
  very close) and where they can be purchased?? Thanks.
