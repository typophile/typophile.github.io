body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nAttached is a couple halfway polished concepts we're giving
  to the client, who is a printing and related services company.  Client wants to
  have the divisions represented, and so far prefer the stacked version on page 3
  -- since they are not wanting to shorten the division names.  (Here is <a href=\"http://appersonprint.com/assets/body/body_01.gif\">the
  original logo</a>.)\r\n\r\nAll comments accepted and respected, of course! "

  body: "Serif one is the best, I think that type Apperson looks like the old one
    so is kinda boring.\r\n\r\nBtw how did you manage to make such nice thin solid
    line ( 1px) that you use as divisor ( second version) ? Illustrator?\r\nCould
    you please answer how? Because I always get blurrer or too light lines._____________________________________________\r\n-\r\ngolden

  body: "@ All:  Thanks for the comments.  I posted it here because I'm not totally
    content with the direction (and am fishing for ideas), and it might be time to
    go back to the drawing board because it's \"ho-hum\".  Two are just subtle changes,
    and we're fans of the classy serif'd version as well; but as you all know -- it's
    hard to get some clients to accept change.\r\n\r\n@ Lex Kominek: Good catch!  We'll
    fix the swoosh on the \"A\" for the next version.\r\n\r\n@ garden:  The PDF was
    generated from Illustrator as direct print to PDF, so the vector art was conserved.
    \ It's just a line with a stroke of 0.6pt. Photoshop is a raster program at heart,
    and is probably what causes the blurring on your lines if you're exporting from
    there."

  body: "Apperson's audience is big corporate down to a single K-12 and higher ed
    teacher.  \r\n\r\n\"The industries that we are strong in for printing are: International
    Trade; Education; Finance (Credit Unions, Mortgage Companies, Pawn Brokers, etc).
    \ For Data Collection (DTS): Hospitality; Medical; Education\"\r\n\r\nIf any of
    you are still awake... they want a \"newer feeling\", but didn't like the serifed
    options we had shown them.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do they do?  Good question -- they
    print forms and create the data capturing equipment and software to go with the
    forms.  They also do fulfillment and logistics ~ they store a company's forms
    offsite at Apperson's warehouses and build a custom ordering site for each client."

  body: 'I would see if you can pull the letters out of the wave a little more maybe
    - but it''s probably too late. Another idea would be to make the wave taper more
    & sooner to allow the text a chance to be read. The O N will take care of themseves
    but the P&R suffer from the ''immersion'' in the wave. Still this would be mitigation
    rather than fixing. I would also look at move the word trade & division just a
    litle to the left because the space between the L & T is optically too wide even
    if it is digitally ''correct''. Or give the E & D betwen Trade & Division more
    space. '

  body: "I think this is one of those examples of why you never give clients the option
    you're not 100% sure on ~ because they'll pick it every time, guaranteed. Although,
    they asked for a logo with an arc in it, and got what they wanted and love it
    - so that's good.\r\n\r\nThanks Paul & Eben.  I've updated a bit to get the middle
    letters to float more, and refined the waves & division kerning with your suggestions.
    \ It definitely improved:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apperson2_6339.gif]"

  body: "That does look better. Cool.\r\n\r\nOn the off chance that more can be done
    and you feel like it:\r\n\r\n- maybe pull the swash on the A slightly more to
    the left? Or reduce the amount it sticks out slightly. Either thing might help
    the A compete less with the under arc and improve coherence.\r\n- maybe pull the
    cut where the leg of the R meets the bowl in further to let the R read better\r\n-
    maybe tweak the ends of the S so they come slightly less close - again to make
    the Letter read better & faster. \r\n\r\n"
