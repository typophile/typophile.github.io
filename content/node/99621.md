body: I find the K in most web fonts to be one of the least attractive letters yet
  have a blog with a name beginning with a K. I am looking to change my current title
  font, Pupcat, to something with a similar retro feel but a nicer k, and something
  that will look good used alongside Trebuchet. So far the only possible font I have
  identified is Bistro Script. I would really welcome some other suggestions. Thank
  you.

    re-read a recommendation from Hrant elsewhere on the site, the Ks (upper and lower)
    in [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_pitu_pro/|FF Pitu]] are
    beautiful! I am also a big fan of Monokrom's designs, [[https://monokrom.no/fonts/faunus|Faunus]]
    and [[https://monokrom.no/fonts/satyr|Satyr]]. Finally, a little less conventional,
    with a slant to the left, I really like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/mark_fromberg/|Canary
    by Mark Fr\xF6mberg]]."

    Bistro Script, I thought maybe [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/sudtipos/hipster_script_pro/|Hipster
