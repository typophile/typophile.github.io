    Penguin Book of Modern Speeches and The Penguin Book of Historic Speeches, 2012\r\nPenguin
    Press UK, London\r\nCover Design and <strong>bespoke typefaces</strong></blockquote>\r\nWhat
    I could say though is, part of the spurless /a, it is very close to Helvetica.
    As A2/SW/HK is run by Henrik Kubel, I would probably choose an Helvetica-like
    from his foundry A2-Type so, why not, [[http://www.newrailalphabet.co.uk|New Rail
    Alphabet]] (which appears to have the same spurless /a)."
