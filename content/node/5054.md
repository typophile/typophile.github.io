  body: Looks nice, it reminds me of Spiekermann&#39;s types. <BR>I&#39;d just say
    that the dot on i and j is a bit heavy, and <BR>the k needs some work. <BR>

  body: '&#62; it reminds me of Spiekermann&#39;s types <BR> <BR>Agreed, but that
    &#34;a&#34; is certainly very French. <BR> <BR>I think the &#34;e&#34; should
    have a thicker bar, and the &#34;k&#34; looks cramped. Otherwise pretty nice!

  body: 'Also agreed with the above... <BR>Very nice! <BR>The horizontals seems a
    little to bold. More thick/thin contrast will help. Look a the s I guess you should
    use this hoizontal width. <BR> <BR>Pictures can say more than my bad english...

  body: very thanks Jens Weigel, but i dont know if it is recomendable adjust the
    points in the screen, i hope soon i will have the time to end the lowercase, and
    do the first tests in the laser printer. <BR> <BR>Many theorics can recommend
    optical adjusts, but i think to see the print over the paper is the correct way.
    <BR>i not saying tou have not the reason, i say the real test will say how much
    i

  body: Dear Juan <BR> <BR>yes your are right! The adjustment I did was a quick and
    dirty adjustment. My english isent very good so better I show it what i mean.
    <BR> <BR>Of course on print it looks different. Maybe you could post a printable
    PDF &#40;White background, some different textsize&#41;
