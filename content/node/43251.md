body: "I need a font for a campaign that conveys \"romance,\" however, I do not want
  a script font. \r\n\r\nThis is for the headline (eg, display purposes)-- the photography
  is romantic, but modern (clean, warm lighting)\r\n\r\nI was thinking something along
  the lines of an elegant, clean, lightly-seriffed font.\r\n\r\nany suggestions? thank
  you!"

  body: Probably terribly old-fashioned of me, but I'd try Perpetua. I believe there
    is a font taken from a display-sized master (other than the titling, which is
    upper-case only).

    It has a lovely italic.\r\n\r\nFournier is really nice too."

    Pro (Opticals)</a> is very lovely and if you need it for large poster sizes don't
    overlook the oft forgotten <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1505">Brioso
