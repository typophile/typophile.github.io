body: "Hello,\r\nI'm hoping there are some former phototypesetting workers on here
  or possibly some folks who are knowledgeable in that area. I'm desperately hoping
  to accurately ascertain a certain font used in various magazines in the 1980s. I've
  included some examples below from three separate magazines.\r\n\r\nHere are the
  examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://i1.wp.com/maximumrocknroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NorCal_scene-MRR006_1983.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://sendbackmystamps.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/editorial-news.jpg?w=949\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thrashermagazine.com/images/image/Features/2009/1983_mag/8302/8302%20800t/8302C2-p1crop800.jpg\r\n(Left
  side)\r\n\r\nThe fonts are neither Signa nor Univers (the G and 9 are slightly different).
  Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!!"
