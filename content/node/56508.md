  one of their fonts. In particular, I need to see if it is possible to get one of
  their fonts in a different file format than what is currently available on their
  site. I've tried contacting Adobe through standard channels (phone and web) but
  haven't had any luck.\r\n\r\nI was hoping someone here could point me in the right
  direction with a name, email, or phone number of someone who I could start the discussion
  with.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDavid"

    sure the font was licensed from Adobe as they resell other folks fonts. "
