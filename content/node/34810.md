  specimen book <a href=\"http://www.hooptie.de\">Motor City</a>. So far we were not
  lucky with our German publishers. They were not \xBBastute enough\xAB - as Hrant
  put it. ;-)\r\nCan anyone suggest a good publisher for graphic design/typography
  books, maybe in the U.S. or in Britain? \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hooptie.de\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bookb1_3890.jpg]</a>"

    you might also want to approach Carlos Segura of T-26... Take a look at his <a
