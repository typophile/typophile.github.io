  to a domain parking page. I hope this is only temporary!

  body: Good news. It's at www.greekfontsociety.gr now. Makes more sense for it to
    have a .gr domain anyway!

  body: On the subject of GFS...I know that GFS Neohellenic has alternate versions
    of some letters, and I can see them in the Apple Character Palette on my Mac,
    but the typography panel in Cocoa applications doesn't seem to allow you to implement
    them. (E.g. it doesn't have a historical/archaic forms checkbox like, say, Palatino
    Linotype or Hoefler Text.) Is there any easy way to use the alternates on a Mac,
    or do you have to go the Character Palette every time?
