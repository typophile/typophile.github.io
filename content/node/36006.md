  by me!\r\n\r\n Jim also have me some great Linotype Ephemera which is helping in
  my Contextual Notan project. I will have photos showing the process up in time.
  \r\n\r\nI hope that Jim will give a presentation for TypeCon next year in Buffalo.
  If anybody has a requests let me know & I will pass them on.\r\n\r\nI will keep
  posting images to the the Typecon Flickr Stream until they are all there. This may
  take a while because I have about 20 Gigs of stuff. There is a nifty Zara Smile
  going up now actually. Check for it."
