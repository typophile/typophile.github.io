  wonder if the font which the word BOB DYLAN is written with is a Futura or a custom
  font"

    1980's. That means it may not be anything in digital form.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The album was a 1964 release. Display headings were typically set by Photolettering
    at that time. (Just for fun, look up the Visual Graphics Phototypositor, a contraption
    that looks like it was invented by Rube Goldberg.) \r\nThe hot designers of the
    mid-60s (among them Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast of Push Pin Studios) were
    rejecting the sterile modernist style in favor of a more playful, eclectic typography,
    with a retro touch supplied by 19th-Century wood type fonts that had recently
    been redrawn for Photolettering. I'm afraid all my Photolettering type specimens
    fell victim to mold in my old house, but that's what \"Bob Dylan\" appears to
    be--a 1960s re-release of an old wood type font.  "
