  me, it has more to do with the way that most people use the italic button in programs
  like Word (and even Quark!) \r\n\r\nwe all know that we're supposed to use the actual
  italic face, so when we do that, should we avoid use of the term <em>italicize</em>?
  is it better to simply say \u201C\u2026use an italic face\u201D or something like
  that?\r\n\r\nhas this term been used in the past or is it a reflection of more common
  type usage?\r\n\r\ni guess it just bugs me when the term appears on client revisions\u2026\r\n"

    Or you could be italicizing it by selecting the italic version of the typeface.

    lies in whether or not the term has been used in the passed, before the days of

    are essentially turning the roman into an italic. hence, <em>italicize</em>.\r\n(^

  body: "The word \"italicize\" certainly predates computer type, and simply means
    \"to print in italics.\" Its usage is similar to \"capitalize.\" It would be impractical
    for a grammar and style handbook to avoid straightforward verbs like \"capitalize,\"
    \"italicize\" and \"underline\" when telling you what to do with your words.\r\n\r\nNobody
    refers to an italicized word as \"an italic word,\" because an Italic word would
    be one with roots in the Italic family of languages. It's like the difference
    between an emphatic word (one might say that \"preposterous\" is an inherently
    emphatic word) and an emphasized word (you can emphasize any word; it's a thing
    you <em>do</em> to it when you represent it in sounds or type).\r\n\r\nIn typophile
    terms, you can only oblique a glyph, but you can italicize a letter. You italicize
    a letter by using an italic glyph for that letter."

    'limitation' in Windows GDI, if a true italic or bold exists you're going to get
    it. You rarely see fake italics in Windows generated content that uses bundled
    fonts. Exceptions being those families that have no true italic - Comic Sans and

    a noun or adjective, the first option to consider is using the word as is, unchanged.
    So, the word <em>italic</em> could theoretically be used as a verb, which is what
    happens with <em>underline</em>. So, \"Did you underline/italic that phrase?\"\r\n\r\nBut
    given the choice, people tend to prefer a word which contributes to a pleasant
    rhythm in sentences (and also perhaps looks good and reads well), even if, considered
    in isolation on purely grammatical grounds, it contains redundancy.\r\n\r\n<em>Underline</em>
