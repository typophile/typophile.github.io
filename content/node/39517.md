  luxury goods at discount prices.  The target audience is women of all ages.  The
  savvy internet shopper would probably be the main demographic; the ability to recognize
  a deal should influence one's decision to purchase at our site.  \r\n\r\nSo, most
  luxury logos I see are simple - text on solid backgrounds, etc.  I would like the
  same for ours but I'm curious as to what I'd be looking to do.  Obviously our current
  logo (if it can be called that) is awful and we need to do something pronto.  \r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated."

  body: I was thinking (before I even looked at your wordmark) the name looks as if  it
    would be nice in a Spencerian Script. You guys beat me to it. I think the only
    change that could be made would be to not have a Rasterized image of the wordmark.
    Also create an initialized version of the type, i.e. "BC". Also mess around with
    the composition and placement of the words "blissful" and "couture".

  body: "A few more possibilities:\r\n\r\n:: Avoid the bevel effect on the flag for
    the language options. It takes away from the premium look a bit. \r\n\r\n:: Probably
    not have the menu run so close to the logo. Would it be an idea to relocate it
    horizontallly in a slim strip below the black band?\r\n\r\n:: Could take the currency
    and brand selectors also into the lower band to avoid clutter on the top of the
    page. \r\n\r\n:: A relatively large image, some kind of headline, or even a fine
    pattern on the home page may set the tone of the brand. Right now it seems to
    get transactional too soon. Even if they are dicounted, you may still want to
    communicate that they are luxury products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "At the very least re-make the images for the menu and the header, they look
    a bit rough.  Or change the menu to text instead.  I also notice the center header
    is not flush with the sidebars.  Another possible change would be making the image
    box a standard height, regardless of image size. This would lock the product pages
    into a uniform grid, rather than where it waves up and down depending on product
    images\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oops. Just noticed that Tony was looking for suggestion on the logo, not
    the website as such :(\r\n\r\nFrankly, it's not a script face I particularly like.
    Even here it's a bit all over the place.\r\n\r\nYeah, your right. Luxury brands
    generally have just beautiful type nicely spaced. Besides, as a general rule of
    thumb, if the name is expressive, then keep the graphic simple. Blissful Couture
    even in this text, communicates a lot, so perhaps go for just a nice typeface.
    Warnock come to mind. \r\n\r\nWhat may be really cool would be to use:\r\nhttp://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/view_font.php\r\n\r\n
