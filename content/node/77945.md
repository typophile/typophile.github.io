body: "Hey guys,\r\nI'm wondering if anyone can identify some of the faces in these
  cheezmo examples? :) Impact seems a favorite of news broadcast design (is the Larry
  King Live a customized Impact, or a different face?) Any identification of the examples
  or alternate suggestions for appropriately ugmo broadcast design is appreciated.
  Thank you!\r\nm[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cnn-newsroom-9_3845.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/customImpact_3786][img:sites/default/files/old-images/State-of-the-Union--video---State-of-the-Union--podcast-e12701840_4882.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/State-of-the-Union--video---State-of-the-Union--podcast-e12701840_4882.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_5051.png]"

  body: A whole lotta Univers, in various widths and weights, except America's, which
    is Gill Sans Bold, and Newsroom, which is not (probably Futura Bold). The w. is
    also Gill, and the names are Futura (quite a dog's dinner of a logo)...

  body: "Hey old nick, I've tried a number of different family members of Univers,
    but I can't find a proper match for the \"Newsroom\" or the \"State of the Union\"
    (which look like they may be the same face)....the leg on the \"R\" in Univers
    curves up (isn't a straight drop) and in Univers it seems the stems of the M,
    N are closer to the same width than in these examples. Any other guesses, or is
    there a cut of Univers I'm missing? Your help is appreciated!\r\nm"

  body: If you look at oldnick's reply more closely, he said that America was Gill
    Sans and Newsroom Futura.
