  use as a watermark (just the \"S2\"). What do you think? \r\n\r\nThe concept drawing
  is a circus-y font (not sure what the correct name for it is) and a normal sans
  serif font combined with a transition into one another. I wanted to try this out
  because the website layout is going to be like that.. creative->professional. \r\n\r\nBTW

  body: hm, okay. I see S2 more than Sr but that's probably just b/c I designed it.
    How would you suggest it look more like S2 -- and are you referring to all of
    them or one in particular?

    it can be raised and slightly pushed closer to the S. Also, you nailed the travelling
    light effect. I actually tried to do shots of me spelling out S2 so I could use
    that as a reference but I couldn't get it how I wanted. I see how it could use
    more stroke weight. I'll work on those 2 things. Thanks.\r\n\r\n@TDF:\r\nOh well,
    there are a lot of logos out there that look alike. Although, stroke-1 doesn't
    look like the K2 logo. But, at least I feel more confident in the readability
    now that I see a company as big as K2 using the same concept."

    in comparison. You could refine it a bit more by making the loop to the 2 from
    the bottom of the s a tad rounder and the body of the 2 seems a bit fat. But having
    said that I don't really think its necessary for it to be read as a perfect S
    and 2 - its kinda interesting as a symbol without the immediate character recognition.\r\n\r\nThe
    shadow is unnecessary in my opinion and i'm not a great fan of the lime green
    - i get web 2.0 rather than arty and professional from that. The colouring of
    3 is interesting. looks kinda like crayons rather than light trails though. \r\n\r\nComing

  body: I actually like the original one labeled Stroke-1.gif. There's an elegance
    to the stroke that the subsequent versions don't have. I agree with the argument
    that it doesn't read as S2, but it is a symbol. Maybe you typeset "S2 pictures"
    underneath the pictogram as opposed to just "pictures"?

    for taking the time to mock up something. I've tried the s to the power of 2 concept
    a couple of times. I still keep coming back to the current idea b/c I think it
    looks slick and more creative. He wants that \"indie\" feel with a professional
    punch that the illustrator versions were supposed to serve. \r\n\r\nAlso, I think
    if the 2 was any bigger in the light picture it would look more like \"82\". But,
    I agree the s can be modified more.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nI just sent him a couple
    of these as mockups. I have a feeling he's going to choose the illustrator version

  body: I like the actual light one better than the illustrator version. Seeing i
    kind of makes the illustrator one look like a smear. Also I read the 2 as a 2
    rather than an r like the illustrator version. It might be cool if you traced
    it out in illustrator so that you had a vector version of it. It may also be nice
    if you gave it a color, perhaps a medium value so that it can be produced both
    over a black background or on white paper, perhaps a red?

  body: Also I experimented a bit with it in illustrator. You can make a vector version
    of it pretty easily by live tracing it with the greyscale mode and setting a blur.
    You can easily edit it how you want it from there, that way you wont have to deal
    with a raster logo.

  body: That should just be a matter of downsizing the image in Photoshop first. The
    great thing about live trace is that it can be used well on even lower resolution
    images, though I find that I have to go back in and edit my anchor points because
    there are usually too many and sometimes live trace leaves jagged edges and screwy
    corner angles.

  body: "Now that's what I wanted you to do. YES. That's much much better than original
    vector version done on a computer. But as everyone else seems to agree (including
    you) S will need a change.\r\n\r\n@tiffany: Any image (even this one) can be converted
    to black & white. And since we are in the age way over 60s' there are lots of
    logos these days that are used in full colour in 95% of applications. They do
    have a BW version too but most of the time it's not used. So in this particular
    case I'd focus on this soft-light-smear effect and then focus on vectorising it
    to also create a BW version.\r\n\r\nI'd still rather have a nice original logo
    like this than something not as distinctive.\r\n\r\nAnd as Cody said: you will
    \"maybe\" have to think of a negative logo. In your case it will be some colour
    on white background. Yes. But. If going for any colour I'd make both version in
    the same one, only different hue to create enought contrast with the background.
    In this case I'd push colours ot yellow-orange(ish) for black background (which
    would make it even more light related) and a bit darker orange version for white
    background. Regular people probably won't notice the difference created by the
    change of hue. And it will still work as a uniform logo in both versions.\r\n\r\nGREAT
    CHANGE. May I also say that apart from playing with light I also like the non-closed
    elliptical shape around it. Makes it very stable and even more perfect. You must
    have great motorics in your arm to create such a nice and smooth shape. Just curious:
    how many attempts did it take to get it right? :)\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
