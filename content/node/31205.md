body: "I use tables in Indesign for lots of layout control purposes - they are fantastic
  for building very complex grids and forms. I often use them to build graphs as well,
  even simple bar graphs, but am having a big problem now.\r\n\r\nI've made a dozen
  similar bar graphs, and had to resize them all slightly (using consistent scaling
  of grouped objects) to fit a new layout. I didn't resize them all exactly the same
  - they started out at different sizes and ended up with the same width; some are
  taller than others. Thus, the text in the various fields is now at sizes like \"7
  pt (11.2 pt)\" and \"9 pt (13.8 point)\" and I need to make it consistent throughout.
  Using paragraph or character styles (new ones) doesn't work, as the overall resizing
  of the table (105%, 117%, 140%, 82% etc.) seems to exert magical resizing powers
  on the text ... I can't copy and paste, either - text is resized upon pasting into
  the enlarged or shrunken table.\r\n\r\nHow do I release these stupid resizing percentages,
  and have them all - at the size they are now - become 100%, so that I can make type
  size consistent between all of them? \r\n\r\nI demand typographic consistency, even
  if my client doesn't notice. Arrrr, it be drivin' me nuts, as the pirate said to
  the barkeep."

  body: "Thank you Miss Tiffany, I've been wondering about that, too.\r\nSo it works
    when the text given says Scale Text Attributes instead of Reset Scaling. The text
    block can't be grouped, and use the arrow tool."

  body: Just a thought, I just designed a logo in Illustrator and sent it to the client
    when he went to resize it the graphics I made didn't resize. I finally figured
    it out, on his version of Illustrator he didn't have resize lines and effects
    checked in his preferences file. Always check the preferences file of your application
    if you get something wacky.

  body: "Well, instead of choosing reset scaling to 100%, i tried \"scale text attributes\"
    and that does the same thing.\r\n\r\nweird thing though; once you've done it,
    instead of simply turning it gray, it actually REMOVES the option completely from
    the menu!"
