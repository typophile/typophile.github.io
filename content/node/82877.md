  body: "Receipt printers like this don't use the fonts that are on computers. The
    typeface is part of the printer hardware. There are computer fonts that mimic
    the look of receipt printers, and someone might recognise a condensed sans serif
    that is similar to your sample.\r\n\r\nMeasuring a few receipts that are around
    my desk, most are 79mm wide but I don't think this is even a UK standard. It depends
    on what till and printer system the retailer uses."
