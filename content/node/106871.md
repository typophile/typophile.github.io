  but doesn't offer a lot of options. Are there any (paid or free) alternatives you
  know of?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

    covered.\r\n\r\nWordpress.org has WF plugins also."

  body: Sorry, I wasn't very clear in the first post. Typeshow is a webplugin for
    foundries to display their fonts to potential customers. Visitors cana type in
    any text and choose a font from the foundry to view it in.
