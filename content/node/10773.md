  body: It&#39;s Ungerish, but derivative. And it&#39;s got some ugly details in comparison.
    <BR>I just set the brand name in Amerigo Medium Italic to show the differences.
    Judge for yourself. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7782.gif"

  body: Thanks, Amerigo is the closest match so far. I&#39;ve also found this beer
    label, I know it has a custom drawn face which make me suspect that the two logotypes
    are made by the same design company. See similarities in lower case &#34;a&#34;
    for instance. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7803.jpg"

  body: Peter, <BR> <BR>Bran M&uuml;sli is made by Finax, and yes, Finax is on Embrink
    Design&#39;s client list along with Spendrups. I think we can assume that the
    Bran M&uuml;sli logotype is made by Embrink as well, and that the font &#40;if
    there is a complete font&#41; is not publicly available. <BR> <BR>
