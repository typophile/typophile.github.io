    which was inspired by similar sources.

    in love with this Brand Proost book and this lettering. I am trying to find a

    That should be pretty close to that book spine.

    Auricfuzz: Incognito is also one of gems that resemble Mercator's work. Trying

  body: Well, Incognito has a roman and italic that should work perfectly with Mercator-style
    swashes. Though perhaps it's not ideal for extended text.
