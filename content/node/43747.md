  about the two fonts used in the first two lines.\r\nThey both look familiar but
  I don't know their names.\r\n\r\nThe second one may be modified/created for this
  purpose, dunno, since the part of the  L leads that perfectly into the red A.\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated."

  body: Well what are you planning on using it for? if it's for the same campaign
    then sure use that font, but I'm sure you could just custom your own shapes in
    the style that they did for personal use.
