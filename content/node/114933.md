  Garden's rebranding</a>. So far most of the feedback I've seen online seems to be
  negative.\r\n\r\nI'm still pretty wet behind the ears as a designer, and I'm afraid
  that whatever atrocious errors those with more experience see in this logo are completely
  flying over my head with a great billowy <em>swoosh</em>.\r\n\r\nCould I trouble
  anyone for a constructive crit about what works and doesn't work with the logo?
  I feel like if I could put myself behind your typographically-attuned eyes, I could
  hopefully learn something.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Olive-Garden-Logo-Redesign-2014_4762.png]"

  body: Never heard of Olive Garden or the re-branding! I like it your design and
    it looks better with the brown background on the website.  The old logo was horrible
    kitchen-kitchy with the words "olives" and the image of grapes together giving
    instant brain-pain.  In this design the lettering is elegant and friendly, but
    perhaps a bit too large compared with the olive branch?  If the owners prefer
    it, you can have some continuity with the old design by embossing the lettering
    and drawing slightly, even giving the lettering a slightly rough edge?  The olives
    can be a bit more elongated.

    are effectively discarding *everything* but the name and re-creating the brand
    from scratch. These two logos are completely unrelated. They don't share the look,
    they don't share a feel and they imply a completely different restaurant atmosphere.
    The company effectively is closing down all existing Olive Gardens and opening
    something different instead. *This* is what people don't like, not the curves
    on the glyphs.\r\n\r\nImagine Coca-Cola deciding to re-brand using a geometric
    sans-serif against steel-gray background. Same here."

    will be confused. It's not unusual for companies to make significant changes to
    their logo. Some customers won't even notice the logo change.\r\n\r\nI'm not in
    love with the new logo, but it's okay. A lot of the criticism at the Brand New
    site is due to negative reactions to Olive Garden itself. Sure it's not the best
    or most authentic Italian food, but people don't go to Red Lobster, Applebees,
    or Olive Garden for fine dining, they go for a decent meal at a reasonable price."

  body: "As I said in a comment elsewhere, something about the color scheme and the
    olive branch reminds me of the logo for Todd English's Figs restaurant, though
    I doubt that was intentional.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figs_4639.jpg]\r\nI
    don't love the new Olive Garden logo, but I like it better than the old \"bring-the-whole-family-for-spaghetti-and-meatballs\"
    logo. I imagine they were going for modern and sophisticated (a more affluent
    clientele?), but they didn't want to scare away the family trade, so they backed
    off a little with a font reminiscent of grade-school cursive."

    a problem. I also think there is a style conflict within the word: some letters
    appear constructed and static, only with a tail or swash tacked on as an afterthought
    \u2013 others appear more fluid. It\u2019s all over well composed and the swashed
    capitals are very charming. The twig is nicely drawn."

  body: "It reminds me a lot of...\r\n<img src='http://i.imgur.com/S2eWrSv.jpg' />\r\n\r\nI
    think it took a lot more feminine approach to Olive Garden. I'm not sure about
    their main target audience but it's definitely appealing more to females than
    its old logo did.\r\n\r\nFor my taste, the composition can be improved. I think
    negative spacing needs to be fixed between Olive, Garden, and the branches. The
    placement for \"Italian Kitchen\" is just.. there. It's subtly aligned center
    to the \"arden\" in \"Garden\" but it does not work well with the rest of the
    design."

  body: "While I did not personally write this post, this article provides the best
    explanation as to why the new Olive Garden logo fails by a landslide [[http://www.adrants.com/2014/03/heres-whats-wrong-with-olive-gardens.php]]
    \r\n\r\nImho, what's wrong with the new logo has more to do with tonality than
    design style. The new logo looks more like something you might design for a frozen
    yogurt shop. It's particularly juvenile in appearance - not that juvenile is bad,
    but it isn't appropriate for a sit-down restaurant where a couple is expected
    to pay $60 for dinner, and that's before the wine arrives.\r\n\r\nI didn't love
    the old logo either. It was complex and clunky, and completely over designed.
    But this one is infinitely worse because it says \"cheap, fast and easy \" --
    a far cry from the sophisticated class of customers that OG wishes to attract. "

  body: "I second @apankrat. The new logo is actually very nice (although I would
    rotate olive branch a bit clockwise to adjust space between elements) but it doesn't
    have anything to do with the old one.\r\n\r\nUnless Olive Garden moves to a new
    market where they're not a recognised brand, new logo should be an <strong>evolution</strong>
    of the existing."

      sense... People hate change. Maybe if they'd illustrated a bunch of grapes instead
      of the olive branch (even if the branch is arguably more related to the name),
      it would've been close enough to the old logo to be considered a natural progression."
