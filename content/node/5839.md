body: in quark &#40;with preferences set to smart quotes on&#41;, after importing
  text, i would just do a simple find/change from &#34; to &#34; and it would automatically
  do the left and right smart quotes for me.  <BR> <BR>it seems that indesign is making
  me do the left and right quotes individually. single quotes are even more problematic.  <BR>
  <BR>is there a simpler way? <BR> <BR>
