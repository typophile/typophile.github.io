  Solo]]'s font catalog, as well as some of the alphabet books he published through
  Dover. As I've surfed the net to find out more about his fabulous collection of
  typefaces, it seems that people sometimes refer to the typefaces as \"his\". This
  has spawned some questions in my mind about what rights, if any, has he acquired
  along with his collection of 4000+ typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe Dover books contain several
  typefaces I'd like to use. Some of them are available as fonts, but some are not.
  Perhaps I just don't know how to find them. Anyway, according to the back covers
  of the alphabet books, the alphabets are copyright-free. What is the accepted practice
  when it comes to digitizing the alphabets in those books, using them as fonts, and
  perhaps selling them?"

  body: 'I know Dan X. Solo personally. He ran a typographic studio in Berkeley for
    over 30 years. He had a large collection of film fonts, including some of my own.
    He created thousands of fonts and is now retired and is an  avocational prestigitator.
    Copyrights have run out on most of his fonts. He also protected himself by creating
    pseudonyms on the questionable font names. '

  body: 'Thanks for the response Robert. Your post tends to illustrate my observation:
    that there is no clear distinction between the fonts he originated, and those
    he acquired. When he acquired new material, did he rename them to make them "his"?'

  body: "Hi Russ,\r\n\r\nIt was by the request of a client that led me to contact
    Dan Solo as to the origins of a particular font he featured in one of his Dover
    books called Kingston Script which he revealed to me it was in fact an original
    design of the Filmotype company.\r\n\r\nAfter learning of this, I spent many years
    researching the company, its legal status, and any living heirs to the collection
    to determing if there was a proper manner to acquire rights and redigitize this
    library of amazing fonts. I was successful in my endeavor and have been busy working
    on a digital revival of the library.\r\n\r\nMost of the 'gems' of his collection
    IMHO are in fact Filmotype fonts and I intend to get a larger showing of them
    available to share with the group for ID purposes.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart :D"

  body: the rest of Dan solo's collection consists of sources such as Castcraft, Facsimile
    Fonts and Visual Graphic fonts. He also had as his source the 2 versions of Hoffman's
    Schrift Atlas for reviving art nouveau types.

  body: "I've been searching for this topic... I have questions about Dan Solo's copyrights
    as well. I guess I am a tad late to the game.\r\n\r\nI found a font in one of
    his books that I want to use, but there isn't a digital equivalent available.
    Knowing that he \"found\" the fonts from various sources throughout the world*,
    I wonder about the copyright issues with the typefaces in his books - can I recreate
    a font from these books? Most of the fonts have no know provenance nor does Dan
    Solo give any credit to any of the fonts. I know some of the fonts are in fact
    reproductions of other differently named fonts but there are a few that I cannot
    find information on anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhat are the legal issues involved with recreating/reviving
    fonts in the Dan Solo Dover books? I plan on digitizing a font and tweaking/adding
    other missing characters once I can figure out the copyright issues.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDalton\r\n\r\n*not
    discounting his hard work at creating a library of fonts, but his books seem to
    come across as a inspiration for making fonts and the whole copyright issue seem
    hazy if he didn't create these fonts."
