  RomanLF, Italic, ItalicAltF, ItalicExpert&#41;. I do have &#34;Ligatures&#34; activated
  and I am using &#34;RomanLF&#34; for the text, but unfortunately no ligatures like
  -st- etc&#34; which are all in the expert set are used! Any ideas?

  body: 'Expert font are in fact not very &#34;expert&#34;, rather very stupid. It
    was once a way to distribute typefaces with extended character set. From PS Type
    1 fonts, InDesign can only insert few basic ligatures like fi, fl, but those ligatures
    must have correct glyph names. InDesign cannot insert other ligatures &#40;st&#41;,
    because these glyphs are available in different font &#40;Roman Expert&#41; and
    usualy have wrong glyph names.  <BR>There are two solutions: manualy replace &#34;st&#34;
    from one font by ligature &#34;st&#34; from another one or build your own OpenType
    font with correct LIGA/DLIG features. Unfortunately the second solution will be
    probably forbidden by EULA.'

  body: The third solution would be to tell FontShop that you want an OpenType version
    of the font, and see if they can provide one - if not now, perhaps in the foreseeable
    future. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    out on a limb.

    pimped or otherwise jacked up versions of their font software. ;o&#41;
