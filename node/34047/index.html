		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, they are sloped in plenty of fonts that I&rsquo;ve examined. It looks like it&rsquo;s a foundry by foundry policy, although the majority seems to favor no sloping.</p>
<p>In one sense, I understand the decision, in that sloped operators or other math symbols don&rsquo;t really have any meaning in the realm of math (at least not the math I&rsquo;ve handled), like sloped or italic letters do. However, it&rsquo;s always been a pet peeve of mine that if I had a situation where I needed to use a sloped symbol for some reason I needed to hunt for one.</p>
<p>As a typesetter, I always preferred consistency of slope within a font and switching to italic as needed. As a type designer, I like the idea of including both within the italic version of a font, with sloped versions available as alternates (or the default, depending on preference) so they entire issue isn&rsquo;t driven by mathematical requirements.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When typesetting mathematics, geometric symbols (like equals, plus, union, brackets, etc) are never slanted.  Letters are frequently slanted, but most letter-like symbols (such as nabla and infinity) are not.  An interesting symbol somewhere in the middle is the partial differential, whose slant is often somewhere between upright and the italic slant.  Does anyone know if the partial differential has been traditionally viewed as a slanted character?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that foundries that slant math symbols do so because just a few nonslanted symbols (such as a plus) in the middle of a whole bunch of italic text would look odd.  It&rsquo;s clear that the symbols are not intended for intensive typesetting of mathematics, since so many symbols are missing.  In fact, that often makes me wonder why foundries even bother to randomly include a few of the more esoteric symbols (such as the integral symbol).  Presumably anyone needing this symbol would need other technical symbols and would be using a more complete math font.</p>

<p>Just &ldquo;following spec&rdquo; &ndash; these characters are in the standard encodings.</p>
<p>Interesting that you mention brackets Stephen &ndash; those are usually slanted in italic fonts, on the assumption that they are not primarily mathematic symbols. So if those who set maths can choose between roman or italic fonts for things such as a/<em>a</em> and (/<em>(</em>, why not for the plus sign, the multiply, etc.?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Nick: <cite>these characters are in the standard encodings.</cite></p>
<p>True, and I guess if you want to adverstise a font as having such and such encoding, it should have all the characters.  However, we&rsquo;ve seen enough errors (or questionable choices anyway) in the encodings to be a bit skeptical of them.  (For instance, the &ldquo;omega1&rdquo; Adobe name.)</p>
<p>@Nick: <cite>Interesting that you mention brackets</cite></p>
<p>I think the sloped brackets are included in italic fonts because they can be used an non-mathematical symbols (ie, parentheses).  In general, mathematical symbols are pretty rigid, in the sense of having few alternate forms.  This is probably because the symbols are used so infrequently compared to letters, and because of the danger of ambiguity since math symbols often stand by themselves without benefit of a baseline or other symbols nearby.  Is it a slanted vertical bar, or a slash?  Is it a slanted plus, or a negated minus sign (whatever one might use that for)?  Another reason is that the demand for math fonts is not that high, so alternate styles were never really developed (because it&rsquo;s expensive!), and hence it&rsquo;s tradition to have just one version.</p>
<p>I think it would be interesting to create a sloped math font and see how it reads.  I don&rsquo;t think there would be much demand for it, though.</p>
<p>@Tupper: good point about short snippets.</p>

<p>Including slanted brackets in an italic font is good in that it allows the user to choose (assuming that there is a companion upright font with upright brackets). Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m with Bringhurst on slanted brackets and parentheses: generally better not used.</p>
<p><em>When typesetting mathematics, geometric symbols (like equals, plus, union, brackets, etc) are never slanted. Letters are frequently slanted&hellip;</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add that I (as one who reads mathematics content regularly) don&rsquo;t think of the letters in math content as being slanted, but that there are both slanted and upright letters. Both variants of a single latter can occur in close proximity with completely different meanings. I might be more likely to confuse m and n than m and <em>m</em>.</p>
<p>With long unbroken streams of English text, variants forms are useful for demarcating sentences (upper / lower-case) or indicating different voices (weight &amp; slant). Mathematics writers generally break up mathematical utterances into very short snippets.</p>
<p>One geometric symbol that could be seen as having slanted forms is the slash / back-slash (which can be used in mathematics to distinguish between left and right quotients).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In proper math setting, numbers are not slanted/italic either. Basically, variables are slanted, and have odd spacing (looser than in text), numbers and symbols are upright.</p>
<p>I think the reason is that italics were chosen for variables primarily so that the variable a and the article a are not confused. Similarily the el/one confusing is also harder to make, and to a lesser extent the zero/O error.</p>
