  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>What [[software|font management software]] do y&rsquo;all recommend for Mac OS X? I had been using Font Reserve in OS 9 which I basically loved but they don&rsquo;t seem to be making it anymore for the mac. I think Fontbook (which comes with the system) basically sucks. It has a nasty habit of activating all my fonts without my asking it to, my &ldquo;collections&rdquo; get mysteriously deleted, and it won&rsquo;t activate/deactivate fonts when I open individual jobs. It also has very limited preview options. I&rsquo;ve heard that Suitcase is good now - I ditched it years ago.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>(forgive me if this topic has come up before - I didn&rsquo;t do a thorough search before posting this)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Suitcase Fusion has plug-ins that bypass the Mac OS font system and talk directy to the application. Fusion also uses FontSense IDs, basically checksums generated from the font files themselves. For that reason, it is able to distinguish between two fonts of the same name during auto-activation. Other font managers tend to work off PostScript name only.</p>
<p>I tend to think that some Mac OS system font cache issues are related to activating an de-activating different font files of the same name. This may be why FEX has a feature for clearing font caches.</p>

<p>I agree. However, this is partly because Mac OS X is the most feature-rich operating system ever in terms of typographic functionality. It supports more font formats than any other platform. Windows doesn&rsquo;t have any way of isolating font activation per user. Windows also doesn&rsquo;t have any system-wide API that would make auto-activation possible, and I don&rsquo;t think Vista is going to be adding it. While these features were present in OS 9 to some extent, the way they were implemented meant that there was a much greater danger of system instability. Also System 9, for practical purposes, never provided much language support.</p>
<p>This comment, of course, is from the perspective someone using a Latin-based language with an interest in graphic design. John Hudson would be quick to point out that Windows wins in terms of support for complex scripts such as Arabic.</p>

<p>My problem is twofold:
All the obscure places that fonts are stored.
It&rsquo;s far more unstable than OS9 ever was from a font management perspective.</p>
<p>My need is reliability, not compatibility.</p>
<p>ATM Deluxe worked like a charm comparatively. I never had to think about it.</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip on the store prompts in FEX, I&rsquo;ve just started evaluating it for my production environment. Other than that it seems pretty seamless, but I&rsquo;m just using it at home and not in a heavy production environment.</p>
<p>Is anyone here using it in that way? What are your thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ Paul, my solution is to turn off the optional fonts in the System Fonts folder and let OS X just use the locked fonts. You can delete those directly off the computer but I keep them there, they are mostly all at the bottom of the font list in programs anyhow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you set your fonts up but I create folders for the Foundries and place the respective fonts inside, and you can create sets inside there as well or on their own. That way I never deal with having all fonts in the same massive folder. I use FEX at home, and used to work out of my house. I recently moved to a studio and use it here as well, I love it. The only time it&rsquo;s gone funky on me was when I tried to preview a corrupt font. Other than that activation and management has been instantaneous between programs.</p>
<p>Also, on my HD I created a font folder where I keep my fonts and organize my own fonts and have the preference set so FEX does not copy or move anything for me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>jselig - Almost the same method here, with one difference. I have my large font library and then I have an &ldquo;active&rdquo; font library of copies that is smaller. I only activate fonts if they are in the &ldquo;active&rdquo; library. The way fonts get corrupted is often when a crash happens when they are active. This way you protect your main library.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve gotta admit it&rsquo;s a little ridiculous. Every time you install something it places fonts wherever and then you have to track them down. I&rsquo;ve got it really stripped down and it&rsquo;s working, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very elegant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I love my Font Explorer X from Linotype; however, it is loading  during my computers start up and causes my cpu to start slower. It also causes strange ghosts of letters on my mac when I erase letters that are typed in things like this comment box or an email.  I  followed the Apple techs directions to try to help my computer start faster. He helped me get the program off off my computers background. Then, I went into a illustrator file and (shock) the type was @#^$%. I had to go into the program and turn on all the types again. After that my computer started up slow like it did before because the program is on my background again.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a way to fix this? I despise my apple font book that takes 45 minutes to open and has the previously mentioned problems. The FEX is great. I love the way it is organized. I have had no problems other that what I have mentioned. I am pretty sure this is something I did. I had followed directions the best I knew how.</p>

<p>This is not in FEX as an issue of &ldquo;politeness,&rdquo; for a lack of a better term… ;-)</p>
<p>Linotype&rsquo;s EULA forbids the modification of fonts. Font Doctor modifies fonts.</p>
<p>Linotype also offers a free lifetime download guarantee on all of our fonts… if your font file becomes corrupted, you can just log-in to to your account and download it again. You will be able to do this for non-Linotype fonts bought via the FEX store as well.</p>
<p>Since Linotype&rsquo;s EULA doesn&rsquo;t allow Font Doctoring, we didn&rsquo;t put this feature in FEX. We don&rsquo;t want to mess around inside other foundries' fonts, just like we wouldn&rsquo;t want them doing the same to ours.</p>

Can you help us understand why Font Doctor&rsquo;s operations, or any &ldquo;font fixing&rdquo; is threatening to Linotype? It is not as if the font is being renamed and sold or given away. In my experience, any action that inconveniences a customer usually has more disadvantages than protectionism.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>BEWARE: rant ahead&hellip;</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t hijack this thread, but these modification rules drive me crazy!</p>
<p>Look at FontFont&rsquo;s EULA. It doesn&rsquo;t allow modification:
&ldquo;2.6. You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter, or attempt to discover the source code of the Font Software. If you want to make modifications to the Font Software, you must obtain the prior written consent of FSI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, if I want to run FontDoctor on a FF font, I need to get a letter! (And of course, there&rsquo;s no assurance I <em>will</em> get one.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not sure what these no-mod rules are for. I&rsquo;ve been told that allowing mods increases tech support difficulties, but I wonder, is Adobe flooded with tech calls for font mods? Was Linotype, when their MyFonts EULA allowed mods? It seems that most people who actually read and abide by EULAs would be able to understand a clause indicating that modifications would not be eligible for support.</p>
<p>These clauses offend a foundry&rsquo;s most fastidious customers, customers who actually care about type, while leaving the uninterested unaffected! What a strange business approach: we only want customers who aren&rsquo;t interested in our product. I certainly won&rsquo;t buy font from outfits with that attitude.</p>
<p>By way of contrast, look at Village&rsquo;s EULA:
&ldquo;You may modify the fonts for your own purposes, but the copyright remains with Village, and the number of computers covered by the license remains the same. You may not commission a third party to modify the fonts without first gaining permission from Village. You may not sell or give away modified versions of the fonts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seems to cover it in a fair way.</p>

<p>Besides, if our customers have a problem with one of their fonts, we would prefer that they come to us with the problem, rather than relying on external solutions that may or may not work.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are several things that can go wrong with traditional Mac fonts that simply don&rsquo;t occur with later (data fork only) font formats. Some of these things occurred because of the way fonts worked under Mac OS 9 and before. For example, under Mac OS 9, the Finder would actually open fonts in a read/write mode and change font IDs if necessary. The Finder could modify fonts! (This cannot occur in OS X)Also, modification of font suitcases was an accepted practice under OS 9 and before. There is a lot of junk out there.</p>
<p>In these cases, the &lsquo;modification&rsquo; by Font Doctor isn&rsquo;t related to outline shapes, hinting, kerning or other design aspects of the typeface. Typically the fixes are simply repairs to the structure of the font suitcase. In my experience, if table data is bad, FontDoctor lists it as irreperable.</p>
<p>In some cases font vendors may not be as forthcoming with replacements as Linotype seems to be. Many older vendors have disappeared. Font vendors depend upon selling fonts, and also re-selling the same fonts later. I don&rsquo;t think it is reasonable to expect Linotype to help peoeple use fonts they already have.</p>
