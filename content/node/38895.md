  body: "Although I would like to be standing exactly where that wave is hitting in
    St. John, that first photo is probably my favorite. It just looks like Texas,
    probably smells like it too! (no offense, I've lived there for a bit)Even the
    old holes for the neon resemble bullet holes from the old west. The only thing
    missing from it is a tumble weed! Great shot, or should I say \"catching Texas
    in one shot\"\r\n\r\n-Lou\r\n\r\n-Do what you love and then do it some more"
