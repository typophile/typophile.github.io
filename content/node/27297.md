body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm using the metric assistance in FL 4.5 to ensure glyphs with
  the same shape are spaced the same. This works fine in most cases, but there are
  a few anomalies. I have a _L class containing, _L: Lslash Lacute Lcommaaccent Lcaron
  Ldot L' and I want to copy the right and width metrics form 'L', which is the key
  glyph, this works fine apart from the Lslash. Because I'm copying the right and
  width of the 'L', the Lslash should have a negative left sidebearing caused by it's
  protruding slash, but doesn't happen. The Lslash takes the left sidebearing and
  width, giving me a irregularly spaced Lslash.\r\nDoes the metrics assistant not
  allow negative side bearings.\r\n\r\nI would really appreicate any advise, this
  small point is driving me mad.\r\n"

  body: i've experienced similar problems in fl studio - it seems to have problems
    with 'some' glyphs build of components. there's not much can do really. at least
    nothing that i know of - except for waiting for an update.... ;)
