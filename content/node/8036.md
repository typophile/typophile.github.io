body: I am looking for an italic for Poliphilus. But I can&#39;t find Blado. We are
  talking metal type here - 16pt. Does any one know who might have it?  <BR> <BR>Or
  what about using Bembo italic? Good idea or bad? <BR> <BR>What other italics have
  you used with Poliphilus? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Sean

  body: Thanks Brian, <BR> <BR>M &amp; H does not have it. Which is sad because that
    is where my Poliphilus came from. <BR> <BR>Any comments on using Bembo italic
    with it?

    various faces: <BR> <BR><a href="http://members.aol.com/aapa96/foundry.html" target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/aapa96/foundry.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Bixler is only casting British Monotype and is not shown. Doesn&#39;t
    mean he doesn&#39;t have it. Berliner, last I heard, is no longer casting. <BR>
    <BR>Poliphilus and Blado were great letterpress faces.  Probably suck in digital
    version. <BR> <BR>Some interesting popular perceptions about the Poliphilus that
    aren&#39;t exactly so. Hmmm, I&#39;m starting to sound like Giampa the Great.
    Am I now the only Gerald? <BR> <BR>Bembo Italic won&#39;t match in the way you
    hope. There is quite a bit of written documentation on the two faces.'

  body: Thanks for the info Gerald. I will take a look around that link.  <BR> <BR>I
    have have tried to contact Bixler but have got no reply back. <BR> <BR>For now,
    I can&#39; find Blado in 16pt. and I have discovered, on my own, that Bembo italic
    will not match just as you said. So sad.  <BR> <BR>After taking a close look at
    both faces, in letterpress form, it is my opinion that Poliphilus is superior
    to Bembo. I&#39;ve always been fond of Bembo too. But now, there is a new kid
    in town. <BR> <BR>The search continues... &#60;i&#62;Blado, where are you?&#60;/i&#62;

  body: Oh, as a side note, I just recentlly found someone that is just blocks from
    my own studio that has a Vandercook. They are totally into giving me some access.
    What a great find and what a small world!

  body: Sean <BR> <BR>I think I had Blado in the 16-pt. I had it cast at Out of Sorts
    Letter Foundry as I recall. They are no longer around. But... I may have sold
    this to Don Hosek of Serif magazine. I sold him a number of metal typefaces. I
    remember that a few years back he was trying to sell his type off. You might check
    with him.

  body: Yep, Dan seems pretty hard to get a hold of. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll likely order
    my type from Bixler. I&#39;ll have to order 20lbs. though. I am hoping I will
    find someone to split the order with me. It would end up being about $150 each
    for 10 lbs. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.
