  who has typeset anything longer than 2 pages with oodles of acronym's knows that
  sometimes* you want those acronym's to disappear a little bit more into the text.
  Here is a link to an InDesign CS4 document with a style sheet setup which you can
  tinker with** and and see just how powerful GREP can be. I mean if you haven't already
  realized that on your own or from reading Nina's post.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.box.net/shared/qgxft86739\">GREP_Styles.indd</a>\r\n\r\n*I
  don't always set acronyms as small caps dependent upon the circumstance and typeface
  in use.\r\n** You will need an OpenType font which you can load and replace Arno,
  unless you have Arno."
