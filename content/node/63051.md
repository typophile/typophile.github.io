  body: (I first interpreted "standard Didot" as the cut the comes bundled with your
    computer or software. Now, I think you may have meant not an alternative cut,
    but an alternative style altogether. Sorry for the misunderstanding!)

    or a lettering artist? I remember Acne Magazine did, for the script they paired
    with Didot. It worked great.\r\n\r\nAlso, don\u2019t write of sans serifs! There
    is a custom face called Fashion Thin that is very interesting. Related: <a href=\"http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=61\">Finura</a>\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Never mind:) Spent to much time writing this post"
