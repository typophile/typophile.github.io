  anywhere. It seems to be a OS X Mountain Lion system font\r\n\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht5379\r\n\r\nIf
  anybody could point me in the right direction, of how to legally obtain the font,
  that would quite awesome. Also, if instead one can name an alternative font, that
  may do the trick. I need the font to create artwork for a sign. My customer specified
  the font on their end.\r\n\r\n"

  body: You should note that Apple and Microsoft use different layout and font technologies
    for handling Indian scripts such as Oriya. The Oriya MN font on the Mac most likely
    uses AAT layout tables, while an Oriya font for Windows will need OpenType layout
    tables. While it is possible that an OpenType  version of the Oriya MN font may
    exist, it might have a different name. I don't have the Oriya MN on my older Mac
    system, so can't suggest an alternative unless you can provide an image.
