  a question about modular grids. Is there a \"rule\" of how high each square should
  be or how many divisions you should use?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nTony Bolero"

    working with grids there is a recommendation to use for example a 12 or a 16 columns
    grid. "

  body: It's always a good idea to divide the grid into equal widths. Having said
    that, if you want to create something out of the ordinary, an unequal grid might
    do the trick and have a fabulous effect.
