  about the pricing for a corporate headline font ( three styles, three weights )
  for a european TV channel.\r\n\r\nSo, how much can I call?  I have to submit an
  \xBBexclusive\xAB and a \xBBnot exclusive\xAB offer. Is there a big difference,
  anyways?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Please help me with some figures.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJui\r\n\r\n"

    of detail you would need to provide on the client and the project at hand for
    people to really help you with the numbers is very likely to piss off your client!\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of exclusivity versus not, the difference is proportional to how much you
    can sell the design via retail yourself. Over time this is generally not negligible;
    also, the perceived difference can be used to manage the price negotiation, for
    example by giving the client a chance to fall back on a less expensive option
    than full exclusivity, without running away outright. But if you think the sort
    of design they'll end up happy with won't sell well in the open market, try to
    sell them perpetual exclusivity. In any case though, unless there's a specific
    technical issue that no existing font in the market addresses, <cite>some</cite>
    exclusivity is only logical, otherwise their competitor(s) can buy the font retail
    and sabotage them.\r\n\r\nIn fact this \"some exclusivity\" tends to make great
    sense because clients like this only need the \"novelty effect\" for a while,
    maybe 2 or 3 years. Such a scheme is common, and can strike the best balance for
    both parties.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to buy an extension thereafter), and/or reversion to the author after a period
    of 2 years of disuse in defined areas, would not be unreasonable, you think?\r\n\r\nNumbers
    are just for examples' sake. Your specifics may vary."

    and paid $300 for 3 fonts (REG, ITALIC, BOLD).  If this gives you an idea of what
    can be earned on the side if the font is only semi-exclusive I hope I have been
    of help.\r\n"

    fonts and semi-exclusive... Am I really that stupid?\r\n\r\nEnlighten me please."
