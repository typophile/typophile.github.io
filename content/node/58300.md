body: "Hello,\r\nI have some business users who desire to display a small, but variable,
  amount of text as a handwritten font on a web page.  They want the handwritten font
  sitting on blue baselines.  This would simulate the effect of writing on notebook
  paper.  Basically, a user enters some text into a field, and the website would display
  this text as this font style.\r\n\r\nSee attachment for an example of what the display
  would look like.\r\n\r\nDoes such a font with a built-in baseline exist?\r\n\r\nThank

  body: "It's possible to have a font with a \"baseline\" as part of the design, but
    there would be no way to make the baseline a different color than the letters.
    A character in a font can only have one color applied to it, and it must be for
    the whole character, not just part of it.\r\n\r\nNone of this matters because
    you can get the same effect on a web page using CSS. Make a class something like
    this:\r\n\r\n.baseline { border-bottom: solid 2px #e9f2f9; }\r\n\r\nThen you apply
    this class to the text you want the baseline to appear under."

  body: "Hi Mark,\r\nThanks for your advice.  The problem with the border-bottom is
    that the business users want to display the font in the web browser to all users.
    \ CSS may only suggest fonts via the font-family property (if the font is not
    on the person's computer, it will default to a system font), and the font-face
    CSS property is not supported in all browsers.  I had thought of using sIFR (http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/)
    to make sure all users see the font, but I had a tough time positioning the baseline
    in the Flash container.\r\n\r\nIf the requirement of \"end user always see this
    font regardless of browser\" was not a requirement, then I could do this in CSS,
    as you stated.\r\n\r\nThank you again for sharing your experience in this."

  body: "It has nothing to do with @font-face. This is an old CSS technique that will
    work with any text (no matter what font) that can be displayed in a reasonably
    modern browser (meaning any browser released since the late nineties). The border
    property works on all kinds of html elements. The rule in my example could just
    as easily be applied to anything, not just text. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the little dotted
    underline that appears when you move your mouse over links on this very page uses
    the same technique, except it's applied to the \"a:hover\" element."

  body: "There are actually two problems with using border-bottom in this case. First
    is that the descenders might get cut off on some of the less compliant browsers
    and second is a lack of support for multiple lines of text. If you're looking
    to use multiple lines of text, you could carefully construct an image to use as
    a repeating background on a body of text. That way, it will appear where you want
    it, be a different color than the text and repeat properly. It should also be
    possible to apply the same methodology to a sIFR implementation (though probably
    a bit harder).\r\n\r\nOf course, you're also trying to use a unique font on the
    web, so if you are only looking at a small number of these elements, then maybe
    just use photoshop to construct the text the way you want it to look with the
    baseline you want and place it on the web as an image. "

    Regardless of what browser you are using, you will see the font.\r\n2) The font
    sits on a baseline.\r\n3) The amount of text is variable and can appear on multiple
    baselines.\r\n4) The number of these small written passages varies\r\n\r\n\r\nMark,\r\nYes,
    I know that border-bottom will work on any HTML element.  \r\nborder-bottom satisfies
    requirement #2, but not #1 or #3 (as Aaron mentioned).  I was trying to ask if
    all four requirements could be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nAaron,\r\nThanks for the
    idea of a background image.  I originally had written off this idea, but I will
    work out a prototype to see if this will work and satisfy the business.  As for
    using a pure image consisting of text and baseline, I can't actually use that
    because of #4.  Since the text is entered by users, we would end up having to
    create hundreds or thousands of these images.\r\n\r\nBert,\r\nThanks for the link.
    \ I will look into this.  Not sure if we have the resources to create a photofonts."

    webpage rendering is done on user's personal computers and any fonts requested
    by the website are pulled from a user's personal database, it is important to
    know which fonts will be accessible no matter who visits the site. So, these overlapping

    Frode:\r\nI finally tried your URL and understand how your Flash works.  I must
    have completely misunderstood you the first time.  Your solution mostly likely
    solves my problem, except the Flash file would have to read text from XML, the
    database, or JSON.  Basically, the user enters the text on one page, but that
    text would be displayed on another page (where the Flash component actually resides).
    \ If my business users want to go with the custom Flash route, they would probably
    find someone through their networks to implement this.  (i.e. I have no control
    on who they hire or ask to do Flash work.).  At least your demonstration shows
    a Flash solution is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Aaron:\r\nConcerning font stacks,
    did you read this article?\r\nhttp://24ways.org/2007/increase-your-font-stacks-with-font-matrix\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nBasically,
    I proposed to the business users these options:\r\n1) sIFR (no baselines)\r\n2)
    Web-friendly fonts and use CSS to show the underlines.  However, if the user doesn't
    have the font installed, it'll default to system fonts.\r\n3) Custom Flash component
    (I didn't show them Frode's demonstration.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not heard their

    be a good backup system in place, ala font stacks. Of course, should EOT or font-face
    become widely accepted, then font stacks aren't really necessary (but would be
    good just in case).
