body: Having to produce posters promoting the [[http://uk.sonispherefestivals.com/|Sonisphere
  Festival]], and I've been asked to match the fonts. I dug out the one used for the
  festival logo (horrible dafont sci-fi thing), but the closest I can get to the one
  used in the menus is League Gothic. Anything closer would be greatly appreciated.
