  of the other characters (like alternate f's, etc) like you can see here:\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000104\r\n\r\nWhen
  I go into Photoshop - Character - OpenType, I only see Swash and Titling Alternates
  as options. Is there another way I get those characters to show up?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nShana"

  body: 'I''ve never noticed a glyph palette in Photoshop. However, two suggestions
    for inserting the exact character: 1) Open the ''Keyboard Viewer'' or 2) Open
    the ''Character Palette''. Both methods allow for insert text into an active text
    box in Photoshop.'

  body: We've complained about this Photoshop shortcoming before. It's sad. If possible,
    I highly recommend using OT fonts with extended character sets in Illustrator
    or InDesign and then bring the artwork to Photoshop if necessary.

  body: Agreed. Type in Photoshop is definitely less than great. I'd paste a Smart
    Object from Illustrator.
