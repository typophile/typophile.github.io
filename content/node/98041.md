    designed in the 1830's and became one of the most widely used English typefaces
    in the 19th century. I have not seen any condensed digital versions, but it was
    the common practice to develop various widths, weights and point sizes for popular
    typefaces.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn's excellent [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/?refby=bowfin|Scotch
    Modern]] is a re-creation of an 1873 version, which actually looks closer to your
    sample than digital Scotch Romans. The G is especially closer in shape. However,
    Nick's font does not have a condensed weight.\r\n\r\nThe American typeface [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/?refby=bowfin|DeVinne]]
    is also similar\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I don't think the specimens shown early in that book are Caslon, as we usually
    know it. If I read the introduction correctly those samples are called Modern.
    Henry Caslon is not the same as William Caslon, who was the type designer whose
    typefaces were the classics we know.\r\n\r\nI admit to not being expert enough
    to sort this out, but I don't believe the posted samples are Caslon.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi Mike, good to make the distinction.\r\nI was referring to the Caslon Foundry,
    not William Caslon I himself. \r\nIn 1829 Caslon IV sells the foundry to Blake,
    Garnett & Co. Later renamed to Blake & Stephenson, and later renamed again to
    Stephenson, Blake & Co. But they always keep operating under the Caslon foundry
    name.\r\nThey also acquired lots of smaller foundries, so I guess that this 'Modern
    Compressed Capitals' must belong to one of those smaller foundries. But they where
    being sold by the Caslon Foundry.\r\n\r\n> \"Caslon, as we usually know it\"\r\nYep...
    but even then, what we usually know today is a mix of lots of different Caslons,
    including the 'American' Caslon cuts by ATF.\r\n"
