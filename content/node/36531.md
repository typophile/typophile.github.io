  Dali: Painting & Film show for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. They are wanting
  to write the words "The End." on a forty foot exit hallway. It would be nice if
  I could find a script that mimics film titles done between the 1920''s and 1950''s.
  Does anyone have any good suggestions?'

  body: Hmmm, I don't really know what I am looking for either. These are great suggestions.
    I think they want a "Hollywood ending" feel to it. I am going to be gluing about
    10,000 plastic ants over the letters on a gold wall. Something more traditional
    cursive?
