body: "I am creating a script font with some slightly complicated contextual alternates.\r\n\r\nIt
  runs fine in the Fontlab quicktest and in Adobe applications but not in Word or
  Wordpad - that's as far as I've got with testing. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to arise
  when substituting a contextual alternate where the alternate glyph has a different
  width from the default. I don't know if this is relevant, I really haven't a clue
  what's happening.\r\n\r\nFor example, in typing 'feel' there's a glyph e.af which
  is an e coming after an f. Typing this results in the first e being placed too far
  to the right so that there is a gap between the f and the e and the first e overlaps
  the second e.\r\n\r\nI'm generating as .otf.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions gratefully received,
  it's driving me nuts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTanya\r\n\r\n"

  body: This may be a dumb question, are the alternates kerned, either manually or
    by class, exactly like the letters they replace?

  body: No, there's no kerning at all for lower case letters, the widths are different,
    though.

  body: A picture is worth a thousand words; a screengrab of the letter combo in the
    FontLab Metrics window and in a Word document would be helpful.

  body: It certainly appears that Word is using the default width, rather than the
    alternate width. Someone far wiser than I may be able to tell you why and how
    to fix the problem other than creating ligatures instead of contextual alternates...

  body: "Hi Tanya\r\n\r\nIf you have been testing and making amends using the same
    font name you may need to delete the Windows font cache file. You can find it
    in:\r\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\FNTCACHE.DAT (for XP)\r\n\r\nDo a restart straight
    after and a clean font cache will be created.\r\n\r\nM"

  body: "Thanks Oldnick, I think you're probably right and in the absence of anyone
    wiser I think I'll try editing the alternate glyps so they have the same width.
    I want too many alternates for ligatures to be a reasonable option.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Malcolm, that is very useful general advice.\r\n\r\nTanya"
