<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I'm laying out a book.
I'm using InDesign CS2 Version 4.0.4.
I downloaded Adobe Garamond Premier Pro (Style: Medium) and I'm testing it on my body style.
It's looks great with one problem. There is a strange arch that connects the right side of the 's' to the left side of the 'p' or 't' at the x-height in all my 'st' and 'sp' character combinations.
I do not think it's a printing issue. The strange arch shows up in all my electronic file types as well.
I'm saving from InDesign CS2 .indd file to a .ps file. Then I'm converting the .ps to a .pdf and printing on an HP C3180.
I've done some googling and some searching about on the net. It seems that no one has had this problem.
Can anyone offer advice or direction?
Thanks,
Mike

<div class=commentbody>Have you looked at the OpenType menu to make sure that "Discretionary Ligatures" is not checked?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the reply.
Yes.
I just figured out the mysterious arches are called ligatures.
I've unchecked "Disretionary Ligatures" and "Ligatures" in the character palette menu.
But the ligatures remain.

<div class=commentbody>Hmm. The st and sp ligatures should only show up if "Discretionary Ligatures" is checked. Sometimes these things can be persistent, for instance if you have somehow enabled them as part of your default text style. Also: Unchecking it when nothing is selected will not change existing text that has it enabled. Have you tried selecting all of your text and then looking at the setting?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes. It's strange.
When I opened the character palette, all that was checked was "Ligatures". I selected the text, un-checked "Ligatures," and nothing happened. I also typed the 'st' and
'sp' combinations into a new .indd file: same attempts at fixing the problem gave the same results. "Discretionay Liagtures" wasn't checked in the OpenType sub-menu. I checked that, than un-checked it (with the text selected) just to see what would happen. No changes both ways.
If I open the glyph palette, InDesign registers the ligature as a glyph. Is there a command like 'disable glyphs' or 'replace glyph with characters'. I can't seem to find a way to do this automatically. And it's a 180 page document, so I really do not want to do it one by one.
Thanks for your help.
Mike

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure, but I think that maybe you are not selecting the affected text before unchecking "Discretionary Ligatures". It works just like bold or italic or changing a font. You have to select the text you want to change first. If no text is selected, changing the setting will have no visible effect.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wish it was my mistake and it was that simple, but it seems it's not.
In all my checking and un-checking of both "Ligatures" and "Discretionary LIgatures," I've had text selected. Still, the "st" ligature and the "sp" ligature remain. This same selected text has changed appropriately when, for example, I have checked and un-checked the "Superscript" and "Underline" options. But when I un-check "Ligature" and/or "Discretionary Ligature," the ligatures remain in the selected text.

<div class=commentbody>Michael, are you on a Mac with Intel processor?

Actually, other people seem to be having the same problem:

Please contact me off-line. Thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes. It's an Intel Mac. A MacBook.
Are you guys on MacBook Pros?
I've gone a number of routes, through the character palette, through the paragraph styles palette. I can't get rid of them. I've checked and unchecked "Ligatures," "Discretionary Ligatures," even "Contextual Alternatives."
Two questions.
1. Is there any way to disable glyphs? Or perhaps a function where I can automatically replace a glyph with two characters?
2. For those who have had no problems with Garamond Premier Pro on Intel-based Macs: What style have you been using (as in "Light," "Medium," "Semibold")? ? I only have "Medium," which I bought as test run to see how it would look for my book's body text.
Thanks for your insights.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have both a MacBook Pro and a Mac Pro--no problem like this on either.
(Which is not to say CS2 apps don't have other problems on these machines. Just today, InDesign crashed about every other time I tried to place an image or export a PDF. Thank goodness for crash recovery, but still very frustrating.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Anything that shows up on screen is a glyph. Characters are abstract encoded slots. Glyphs are what shows up on screen.
You want to disable glyph substitution, but you've already done everything necessary for that.
It is very curious that a few people are having this problem, but most are not. :(

<div class=commentbody>Could be corrupt font caches. You can get rid of these with FontFinagler or other utilities (Onyx, if I'm not mistaken) and also with Linotype Font Explorer.</div>
