  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles!!

Please tell me how to use the pen tool while drawing a typeface?
I am designing a Devanagari typeface(attached) and really don't know how to use the tool so that it look more professional and finished. Any tricks_??

I tried converting few existing faces into the curves to see the node structure and they really looks so perfect and almost the same structure in most of the typefaces.
But mine looks totally unprofessional and dirty. Please tell me how they work in the industry_? Or they use completely different tools_?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/how to use pen tool_4500.jpg]

This is a snapshot from the Illustrator just to show the node structure of my Devanagari face am working at the moment.

thanks a lot

The most basic thing, according to Leslie Cabarga, is that when you delete a node the outline springs out instead of collapsing as in Illustrator. For letters this is useful. The are a whole lot of other things also that FontLab does, but download a free demo of one of their products and you can try it and explore for yourself.

FontLab is not very intuitive at first, but is very powerful, and you will keep discovering new things as you use it.   </div>

If the stems were completely vertical, there'd be no need for two nodes. The "t" I'm not so sure about. Once you import into FontLab, the Font  Audit feature would give you an error message about these points. It's a useful tool...but completely useless for a rough looking font.

		<div class="commentbody">If it's Frutiger, those aren't "extra": those are what it took to get the curve he wanted. If you ask me Frutiger typeface is one of those that is worth studying again and again--a masterwork from a master. 

Because with Bezier curves you are dealing with cubic equations, there is a limit on what shape you can draw from point to point. So if you want a different shape between nodes than what you can get with one Bezier curve, you need more nodes to get what you want.  

More experienced type heads than I can tell you more, but I would say draw it with as many nodes as it takes to get the shape you want. Then copy to mask and take away all but the extremes. Then adjust handles and maybe nodes to approximate what you had originally. Then add more nodes if not satisfied. Repeat again and again and ..... 

If you open a number of good typefaces you will see in what situations intermediate points are added. But the eye is the final arbiter. </div>

That had occurred to me, and may be the case here, but I suspect you will find if imported into fontographer or fontlab that you will get a significant number of points between the extremes. This is because, as Terry said, there are subtle flairs in Frutiger. They don't give the look of obvious flairs, but rather give balance and liveliness to the letters. I don't own it or I'd post examples; perhaps others can. </div>

It may take a brief time to learn the drawing differences in FontLab but it is well worth it in the time you will same later trying to fix your outlines.

this is one of the best. also Leslie Cabarga's <em>[[Learn FontLab Fast]]</em>. read through the user's manual. ask questions in the "Build" forum. i've also started some tutorials in the [[how-to]] section of the wiki, but they're not really FontLab specific.</div>

1. Theoretically, it will operate as a program more quickly, but this is not significant with modern computers, I have heard. 

2. Putting nodes at the extremes tells automatic hinting to hint correctly. As I understand it this is the main reason to put them there. Some of the tech-savy people can tell you more about this. 

3. On your 'S', it does normally have some nodes along the spine. This is not a problem. But you have a stray node off any line. This might mess up your font. You will probably get a warning from FontLab that you have off-curve points, if you try to generate a font (which you can't do with the demo, I think).

4. Generally, when you have more nodes you have more problem making a smooth curve. The trade-off is that with fewer nodes, you may not be able to get the curve you want. There are no rules about this, so far as I know. You just work with it until it looks good to your eyes. </div>

For example, I've found that when I use Windows TrueType fonts on Mac OS (it's not so bad with newer versions) or Linux, the shapes of the curves can be look weird.

PostScript curves don't seem to have this problem in Mac OS, but they do in Linux.</div>
