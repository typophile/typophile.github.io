body: "I have a really bad habit. Whenever I use a font in a logo (and other designs),
  I can't help but to tweak it. One reason is just to meet the needs of the design.
  The second reason is that it messes with the heads of the competition when a client
  brings them my art to recreate. What can I say. I work in a very competitive market
  where professional courtesy and copyright infringement are secondary to money. \r\n\r\nI've
  noticed that almost all EULAs do not allow for modification of their fonts. However,
  it is not clear if this includes modifying the outlines to fit a specific design?
  I've always assumed that it was to protect against changing the font file itself?

  body: "If I'm correct, the EULA keeps a user from editing the actual font file.
    If you are to outline it in Illustrator, or other such programs, You should be
    okay. In fact, nearly any logo worth it's salt has been modified from the original
    letterforms to fit the need.\r\n\r\nAnyone care to tell me if I'm mistaken?"

  body: Modification of the curves in Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw or whatever
    is okay by me; in fact, my EULA even allows modification of the actual font itself
    IF the modified font is used internally only by the licensee, and not resold.
    Few other foundries allow this latter instance but, if the changes make the font
    work better for a specific company and/or application, I don't see it as a problem.
