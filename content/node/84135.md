  the image recognition, Identifont questions or forum but am having no luck so far
  and it's been a few days. (I just stumbled across this site today)\r\n\r\nI can
  find similar fonts to this (Snowslider, Netto) but nothing that is close enough
  to tweak fairly painlessly in both caps and lowercase.\r\n\r\nAny and all help appreciated!\r\n\r\n"
