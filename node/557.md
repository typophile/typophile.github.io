  body: Upon further reflection &#40;hey, what do you want, I was aiming for speed&#41;,
    that might not quite be it, seeing as the serifs are thinner in the sample. However,
    if the sample was scanned from a magazine, that could account for it. On the other
    hand, it could be a custom version just for that particular magazine. Where did
    the sample come from?

  body: Thanks, Jared -- just trying to do my part, and, eventually, beating Hrant&#39;s
    one-minute record. I think Typophile time stamps should start having seconds on
    them. I &#42;know&#42; Yves is gonna back me up on this one! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
