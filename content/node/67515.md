body: Hi, I'm designing a branding for my school project for a Guy Ritchie film festival.
  He is the director of the movies like Snatch, RockNRolla, Lock Stock and Two Smoking
  Barrels, Revolver, Serlock Holmes. His movies are mostly about the lucky underground
  criminals of London. I would like to ask which typefaces are going to be appropriate
  for his style?

    you just listed give you a wealth of material to draw from?

    sort of thing in mind. Violent action films, guns, getting kicked in the groin
    etc.

  body: "^cfig is right.\r\n\r\nI think the challenge is to look at all of those existing
    titles, and divine some common ground... Overall, I think the brand should be
    understated because the communication is a showcase of other material, not a showcase
    of the man. He's the artist behind the work, and perhaps your type choice should
    reflect his role behind the camera rather than some representative cliche of his
    films."

    identity that we see in this films.
