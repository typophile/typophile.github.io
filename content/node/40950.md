body: "I created this logo on my daughters computer. Her computer crashed and had
  to have her hard drive reformatted. Now I can't figure out what the font was we
  used to create this logo. I used WordPerfect's Text Art to create the logo. I think
  the font name started with a B or C but am not sure but it was somewhere in the
  first half of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe logo is at www.epeakbiking.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/epeakbiking_6264.png]"

    a second I thought I would smell some Palatino (or <strong>B</strong>ook Antiqua)
    in this, but the \u2018g\u2019 is open.\r\nStarting with B or C, you say? Could
    have been some <strong>B</strong>askerville, once \u2026 then again, this could
    have been anything.\r\nHow many fonts do you have?\r\nF"

  body: It isn't something like Book Antiqua or Baskerville. Those fonts have nice
    smooth curves. As you can see this font has kind of rough curves. Also after discussing
    this more with my daughter I figured out we used Microsoft Word's WordArt, not
    WordPerfect.
