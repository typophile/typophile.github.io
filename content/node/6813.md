  body: It is not off topic, but I think there needs to be some clarification of terms
    before this argument becomes constructive. Porn, feminism, sexuality, these mean
    many different things to many different people. By using these words, you can&#39;t
    assume that people know exactly what you are talking about. There are branches
    of feminism that are pro-sexuality and pro-men, believe it or not, and obviously
    those that are against men AND porn. <BR> <BR>So what exactly are we talking about
    here? Is all exploration of sexual identity and desire porn, and therefore does
    that make all people who are interested and passionate about their sexuality violaters
    and abusers of women&#39;s sexuality? Every type of media produced about sex is
    not porn. It&#39;s like trying to argue the exact nature of what art is, it&#39;s
    so different for so many people, unless you know exactly what people mean by saying
    that word, there&#39;s no point.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t doubt that some forms of
    porn ARE abusive and degrading to women. But I would like to see some acceptance
    that some porn is empowering, intelligent and engaging, to both men and women,
    and perhaps we all need to accept that this is, like many things, not a clear,
    black and white issue.

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s off topic, given the topic. Personally, I&#39;m
    with Zara on this one. But that&#39;s just my opinion, of course. At the same
    time, I consider myself strongly pro-feminist. &#40;I used to say I was a feminist,
    but some folks claim that it&#39;s not possible for a male to be a feminist. Whatever.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just suspicious of arguments that porn is degrading only to women.
    Sometimes I think some of that belief stems from a conservative anti-sexuality
    viewpoint that says women can&#39;t possibly enjoy sex as much as men. <BR> <BR>An
    interesting feature of the porn industry is that if anyone is degraded, it can
    be argued that is at least as degrading to men as to women. Male porn actors are
    paid a small fraction of what the women are paid, they don&#39;t get the same
    kind of billing and very few become stars. And certainly what&#39;s required of
    the male actors is more demanding. Yet in hard core porn, they are more likely
    to be just mobile genitals in the movies, while the women are central characters.
    If women are the sexual objects of desire in porn, then men are just the desire
    itself. <BR> <BR>So, I guess I am more likely to buy an argument that porn is
    degrading to people in general. But even that is an oversimplification to me.
    What I &#42;do&#42; absolutely believe is that in the absence of other information
    and role models about sexual relationships, most porn, when viewed by people whose
    attitudes towards sex are not fully developed, has the potential to create unhealthy
    expectations and denigrate the value of emotional intimacy and love in a sexual
    relationship. On the plus side, most porn at least teaches that sex is fun, which
    is a Good Thing in my book. <BR> <BR>Probably there are a lot of companies/people
    in the porn industry I wouldn&#39;t want to work for. But I&#39;m pretty sure
    there are at least a few that I would be willing to do design work for. And almost
    all I&#39;d be willing to do expert witness, document verification kinds of work

  body: 'JFP: <i>I wonder about the survey you launched? Are you in front of such
    dilema yourself?</i> <BR> <BR>No, but it is something that I think about from
    time to time. One of the troubling aspects of the current configuration of capital
    is that it is very difficult to find any company that is not in some way connected,
    e.g. by investment, to other companies. So even if one wants to avoid working
    for e.g. war profiteers, one can never be certain that one is not in some way
    contributing to businesses that one thinks unethical. <BR> <BR> <BR>Regarding
    porn, I don&#39;t doubt that there are more and less abusive and exploitative
    examples and, if there is to be porn I doubt if many reasonable people would disagree
    that it would be better run by women and with guarantees to respect the rights
    and dignity of the participants. But before we start talking about some porn being
    &#39;empowering&#42;, intelligent and engaging&#39; we might ponder whether those
    things are, in fact, part of the distinction between the pornographic and the
    erotic. Most legal definitions of pornography centre on the functional intent,
    in which pornography is judged to be <i>solely</i> intended to provoke sexual
    arousal, which suggests that if the intent is e.g. to intellectually engage one
    may already be moving beyond the merely pornographic. I think this is a useful
    way to look at the question, and worth maintaining rather than blurring the line
    between the pornographic and the erotic in a way that can only benefit the makers
    of degrading and exploitative material. <BR> <BR>All that said, I&#39;m basically
    in agreement with William on the characteristic nature of porn. But will add that
    porn is as degrading to the consumer as to the women &#40;and men and children&#41;
    who are consumed. The reduction of human beings to sexual objects of animal gratification
    is inherently degrading, because we are capable of -- and, I would say, made for
    -- so much more. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; I don&#39;t believe there is any such thing
    as &#39;empowerment&#39;: it is a jargon-driven illusion marketed to the economically,
    socially or politically disenfranchised to convince them that their situation
    is a subjective problem of self-worth, rather than an objective state of injustice.
    It is the language of diversion: among other things, the process by which feminism
    in North America has been diverted into the dead-end of identity and gender politics
    and away from economic and social justice.'

    on adolescent sexuality&#41;. I literally can&#39;t remember not knowing where
    babies come from, either. <BR> <BR>But my own experiences aside, for a very long
    time the predominant message about sex in the English-speaking countries was that
    it was dirty and sinful. I think there is still a lot of residue of that attitude

    &#34;good&#34; is now pretty prevalent among folks our age and younger. <BR> <BR>On
    the side, I do believe there is such a thing as empowerment. But I think that
    people are empowered either by achieving economic and social justice, or by being
    given access to the levers of power that will enable them to achieve that justice.

    to exchange one set of extremes for another: puritanism for license, perpetuated
    by the fact that &#39;sex sells&#39;. And, of course, anyone who even suggests
    that there might be some appropriate balance is will be accused of being censorious,

  body: '&#62;Well, that&#39;s what Protestantism gets you  <BR> <BR>No, John, the
    view of sex as inherently sinful is mainstream traditional Christian, including
    Catholic. To start with you have Saint Paul saying that celebacy is spiritually
    superior. Then you have for example, Augustine: &#34;A good Christian is bound
    to love in one and the same woman [his wife] the creature of God whom he desired
    to be transformed and renewed, but to hate in her the corruptible and mortal conjugal
    connection, sexual intercourse and all that pertains to her as a wife.&#34; [De
    Sermone Dom. in Monte, 41.] And Pope Gregory the Great &#34;Sensual pleasure can
    never be without sin.&#34; And even in the current Catholic Church many view sex
    within marriage as &#34;mere tolerated in view of procreation &#40;New Catholic
    Encyclopaedia, Annual 1988, p 414&#41; <BR> <BR>There is a long Christian tradition
    of seeing the body as corrupt, and sexual desire as inherently sinful. I think
    that both this tradition and the &#39;modernest&#39; reaction to it, which I objected
    to Zara about, are harmful to human happiness and well being. <BR> <BR>As John
    noted, my touchstone for sound views of sexuality put human wellbeing first. My
    views are informed by Jewish views of sexuality, which are at odds with Christian
    ones, but I also object to traditional Jewish views where I think they are at

  body: '<i>...the view of sex as inherently sinful is mainstream traditional Christian...
    </i> <BR> <BR>Well, even noting that you ignored my ironical smiley, this is a
    gross simplification. The tension between the flesh and the spirit necessarily
    makes sex a complex issue for any religion that takes the interior life seriously.
    Christianity, like Judaism, puts limits on the appropriate expression of sexuality,
    for social, moral and spiritual reasons, limiting it to marriage, for instance,
    and in the case of Catholicism and Orthodoxy also affirming chastity and celibacy
    <i>as expressions of sexuality.</i> And yes this has sometimes led some to puritanism
    and a denial of all sensual pleasure, especially in that period when Greek and
    Roman converts imported stoicism into Christianity or, in the case of St Augustine,
    remnant Manichaeanism. But to cite a few readings -- only one canonical and that
    clearly not saying that sex is inherently sinful -- to suggest that this is the
    predominant teaching of mainstream Christianity is unfair. The wholesale condemnation
    of sensual pleasure has long been understood as contrary to the belief that the
    physical order was created by God and is fundamentally good: a basic teaching
    that is reaffirmed by the Magisterium when puritanism, stoicism or Manichaeanism
    rear their heads. What <i>is</i> mainstream is the observation that lust, i.e.
    selfish sexual desire for physical gratification, is one of the most pervasive
    distractions of the spirit away from God, hence it is counted as one of the deadly
    sins: those sins that by habit come to replace God in the human heart. Obviously,
    in this perspective, sexuality that is directed toward physical gratification
    as its sole or primary goal -- e.g. pornography -- is disordered. By the same
    token, not everything that is erotic is pornographic or in the nature of lust.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also note that, like most other things in North America, Catholicism
    here has been more touched by puritanism than in, say, Italy. A friend of mine
    who has led groups of North American pilgrims to Rome has observed their shock
    when they encounter the frankness of fleshy humanity in the paintings and statues
    that adorn many churches.  <BR> <BR>And yes, the Church still teaches that sex
    is <i>primarily</i> ordered to procreation, and that sex from which the possibility
    of procreation has been deliberately removed is disordered. But it does not teach
    that procreation is the sole purpose of sex or of human sexuality. Rather, sex
    is understood to be a wholeness, involving flesh, mind and spirit open to the
    gifts of God, including spiritual gifts, emotional gifts and the gift of life.
    What is sinful is to reduce it or to subtract from it any part of that wholeness,
    so that it becomes a shadow of what it is meant to be. This wholeness is well
    expressed in the official statements of the Church, e.g. the recent Catechism:
    &#39;Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body
    and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate,
    and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.&#39;
    [Article 2332] <BR> <BR>I should note that when I talk about religion, I am not
    expecting anyone outside my religion to agree with me or to conform to the direct
    moral implications of what I believe. I&#39;m just explaining where I&#39;m coming
    from. On the other hand, I don&#39;t believe that things are immoral because the
    Bible or the Church teach that they are: I believe the Bible and the Church teach
    that they are immoral because they are immoral, and can frequently be demonstrated
    to be immoral on purely natural and secular grounds as causing misery, undermining
    social bonds, leading to illness and death, etc. I&#39;m very well aware, having
    lived for many years as an atheist, that some aspects of Catholic morality make
    little sense &#39;from the outside&#39;. That is, I wouldn&#39;t expect any non-Catholic
    to abide by the Church&#39;s teaching on contraception, for example. Without conversion,
    without first turning toward to God and seeking His will, one isn&#39;t likely
    to perceive the fractured, or at best partial, nature of sexuality that closes
    itself off to the gift of life. <BR> <BR><i>My objections to Zara&#39;s views,
    and sexual modernism, have to do with their very harmful effect on human happiness,
    and in particular leading to the destruction of love.</i> <BR> <BR>In this observation,
    we are completely in agreement.'

    of teachings tha John is citing. Often they seem like well- or thinly-disguised
    versions of pleasure-is-bad. Maybe I&#39;m just projecting my prejudices. <BR>
    <BR>But my own view is pretty straightforward. Pleasure is inherently good--but
    that principle applies to everyone, and over time. <BR> <BR>That is, things are
    good that create pleasure for all affected. But short-term pleasure that causes
    long-term unhappiness is probably a bad idea. I think that most people have some
    &#40;usually a lot of&#41; emotional involvement in having sex, so for most people
    having sex with random people they&#39;ve just met is a bad idea. Not because
    it&#39;s immoral, but because it is has a good chance of leading to unhappiness.
    <BR> <BR>Relatively casual sex is often a symptom of other kinds of unhappiness
    or insecurity or feeling unloved. This too doesn&#39;t make it bad; just an outlet
    or a way of trying to paper over other emotional issues. As long as it doesn&#39;t
    simply create more unhappiness &#40;for example, through guilt, or feeling rejected
    when the casual partner doesn&#39;t remain interested&#41;, there&#39;s nothing
    &#42;wrong&#42; with it. But if you don&#39;t feel good about yourself in the
    first place, it sure isn&#39;t going to fill whatever void you&#39;ve got. <BR>

    to preserve another life. I do not consider a human being in the embryonic or
    foetal stage to be any less a human being than an infant, a child, an adolescent,
    an adult or a geriatric: they are all phases through which the same individual
    human being, created at conception, passes so long as his or her life is not interrupted.
    There is no magic moment after conception when a non-human suddenly becomes a
    human. This is not a religious opinion: I know atheists and agnostics, including

    abortion and capital punishment side-by-side deliberately, because in political
    discourse, especially in the USA, they tend to get separated.'

  body: John, do you honestly know anybody who found wine, beer or scotch to taste
    good the first time they tried it? It seems to me that these are acquired tastes,
    and the primary reason they are acquired is because of the effects of the alcohol
    in them. Otherwise, a lot more effort would go into perfecting non-alcoholic beer.  <IMG

    <BR> <BR>Labeling arousal and gratification for their own sake as &#34;animal&#34;
    is exactly the kind of denigration of physical pleasure I&#39;m concerned about.
    We celebrate many wonders and pleasures we share with other creatures that are
    pretty basic physical experiences, even having children. Food and drink don&#39;t
    have to have non-sensual artistic or philosophical value to be appreciated. Yet
    somehow sex is different. <BR> <BR>The big difference is that sex is a more powerful
    physical experience than the rest. Outside of certain drugs, it is the greatest
    of earthly pleasures. Unless one centers a religion around it, it clearly threatens
    the primacy of religion. Maybe that&#39;s the underlying reason why so many religions
    try to put sexuality in as restrictive a box as possible, to try to minimize how
    big a part of life it can be for people--make it less important to their happiness,
    and the religion more important. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'John,  <BR> <BR>Your apology for Christian views isn&#39;t traditional Christian,
    including Catholic. Here is St. Thomas in the Summa Theologica, clearly saying
    that if you have sex with your wife for the sake of pleasure, you are committing
    a sin:  <BR> <BR>&#34;For if the motive for the marriage act be a virtue, whether
    of justice that they may render the debt, or of religion, that they may beget
    children for the worship of God, it is meritorious. But if the motive be lust,
    yet not excluding the marriage blessings, namely that he would by no means be
    willing to go to another woman, it is a venial sin; while if he exclude the marriage
    blessings, so as to be disposed to act in like manner with any woman, it is a
    mortal sin.&#34; <BR> <BR>The modernist reaction against Christianity was for
    a good reason. The current attempts to paint Christianity as not having a significant
    hostile streak toward sexual desire are just historically false, including your
    effort John.    <BR>   <BR> <BR>&#62;especially the Abrahamic ones <BR> <BR>Peter,
    the traditional views of Judaism, particularly within the Talmud, are radically
    different from the Christian ones. For example, here is Rabbi Akiva: &#34;When
    the husband and wife are worthy the shechinah [Divine Presence] abides with them.&#34;
    &#40;Sota 17b&#41; Marriage and procreation are seen as divine commandments, and
    hence voluntary celibacy as a sin. Furthermore, for a man to sexually please his
    wife regularly is mandatory, even when there is no possibility of procreation.
    <BR> <BR>The views of Jewish thinkers over the millenia changed, and under the
    influence of Christian Europe became more prudish than in the Talmud.  <BR> <BR>
    <BR>&#62;pleasure is inherently good <BR> <BR>Thomas, your view is close to the
    Hedonist view that pleasure is the only good. But the Hedonist view is not psychologically
    sound, because pleasure, happiness and fulfillment are all different, overlaping
    things, and thinking of them as only one variable is a very serious blunder that
    has disasterous consequences. To quote Cheryl Crowe: &#34;If it feels so good,
    how can it be bad? If it feels so good, why am I so sad?&#34; The pursuit of pleasure
    can be destructive of happiness, and this is what traditional religions have understood
    well, and modernism has been fundamentally misguided in ignoring.'

  body: 'William, I&#39;m making no effort at all to counter St Thomas: I think he&#39;s
    absolutely right. He&#39;s saying that lust can occur in marriage, i.e. that the
    state of matrimony is not some magical protection against lust, as some Christians
    have treated it. Lust is selfish desire, which treats the other person as an object
    for physical gratification. So lust in marriage is a sin, just as it is outside
    of marriage, because it dehumanises and reduces sex to a merely physical act.
    The sinfulness is in the objectification and absence of virtue, not in the pleasure.
    If the pleasure is mutual, and not selfish and objectifying, it is not lust. St
    Thomas is making a charitable and pastoral concession though, by noting that lust
    within marriage is a lesser sin than adultery. <BR> <BR><i>Furthermore, for a
    man to sexually please his wife regularly is mandatory, even when there is no
    possibility of procreation.</i> <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s an excellent teaching.
    <BR> <BR>Note that the Church teaches that sex when there is no natural possibility
    of procreation is not a sin; what it proscribes is deliberate contraception, i.e.
    the artificial prevention of the natural possibility of procreation. This is,
    indeed, a recent clarification, and yes, there are some Catholics and other Christians
    who disagree with this. The Magisterium is quite clear however: &#39;Periodic
    continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation based on self-observation
    and the use of infertile periods, is in conformity with the objective criteria
    of morality. These methods respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness
    between them, and favour the education of an authentic freedom.&#39; [Cathechism
    of the Catholic Church, Article 2370.] That last comment, regarding &#39;authentic
    freedom&#39; -- as against the false liberty of taking a pill to get rid of consequences
    -- is to me one of the most attractive aspects of Catholic teaching on sexuality.
    <BR> <BR>As I understand it, the traditional teaching of Judaism also opposes
    contraception as being contrary to the mitzvah to be fertile and increase, especially
    when it is employed for selfish purposes. Apparently some forms of contraception
    are permitted in family planning, though, if the couple do intend to have children.
    Is this correct?'
