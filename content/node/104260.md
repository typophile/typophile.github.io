  friend has asked me to identify the font in the picture I attached.\r\nI have tried
  www.whatfontis.com and www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont but I cannot find what I'm looking
  for.\r\nMaybe you guys have used this type before in the past.\r\nSorry for the
  trouble, and thank you very much for your help! :)"

    file is already lost and he asked for my assistance. \r\n\r\nThe closest is (I
    think) FF Cocon Regular, or Mic32 New Rounded Medium with some edits.\r\nThe most
    notable difference is the uppercase 'M' character (those two touches the baseline).\r\n\r\n"
