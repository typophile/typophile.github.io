body: 'Hi! I''ve been on a treasure hunt looking for a font similar to Wendy (see
  sample). I need a script face that''s a little more sophisticated and not so widely
  used. Because I''m going to be using it all lowercase, it''s important that the
  "b''s" and "l''s" have flair. If this helps: the Wendy font is a little too round,
  or full, and skews towards the children''s market.  Thanks for your input! '
