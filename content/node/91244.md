body: "It's been a long while since I've been stumped by one and this one got me simply
  because there are far too many sites to get simple handwriting fonts like this nowadays
  so I have no idea where it could have originated. Unfortunately I need to find out
  this exact one and not similars. If anyone can help me I've attached what I'm looking
  for.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys!"

  body: I think it's handwritten as duplicate letters are different shapes.

  body: "I know that it's definitely not handwritten, as it's a variable letter that
    goes out to a mass market, so they use variable placements to put in the <first
    name> <auto value> and what not. The only explanation for the different letterforms
    for the same letters would be that it's an opentype with ligatures & alternates
    turned on.\r\n\r\nThanks though.. any other ideas?"
