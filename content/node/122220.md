  body: "Why not? But you should study print examples to ascertain the way you should
    compose. Eg the original Futura has long ascenders and descenders and \u2018likes'
    ample linespacing. \r\nLonger stretches of text may be problematic if the word
    count is on the high side, but short lines aren't okay either. Futura is a high
    bred workhorse typeface that needs a lot of attention.\r\n\r\nIn your example
    the full caps headings are awful, they need more letterspacing and subtle kerning.
    The body text appears to be unhinted, ergo very inconstistent in colour. Needs
    a lot of work, or searching for a better source of webfont.\r\n\r\nBut I do like
    Futura."

    body: '@Bert Vanderveen Thank you so much! Your feedback is so helpful and accurate.
      I agree, Futura needs a lot of attention. I''ll work on the suggestions you
      made and see if I can make it look clear and aesthetically appealing. I was
      a little hesitant because I wanted to do justice to it and was contemplating
      if it would be too subtle and delicate for a website. It''s a lot harder to
      make it work for the web plus that color makes it look finer. '

    for legibility, if it is set properly (decent type size, leading, kerning, color),
    it can be perfectly legible."

  body: "Yeah, of course. People also use Comic Sans. Apple also uses Helvetica as
    UI typeface.\r\n\r\nIf you set your Futura to 48pt and positive tracking, everyone
    can see it. We say it\u2019s not \u201Clegible\u201D only when you try and compare
    a 12pt/16pt Futura and a 12pt of, say, 12pt/16pt Sabon. There\u2019s no only one
    correct way to \u201Cuse Futura for a website;\u201D there\u2019re millions of
    way to use it.\r\n\r\nYet often times people use incorrectly. Not that it can\u2019t
    be used on a website; finding that millions of correct way \u2013 that\u2019s
    the problem."

  body: "Nothing here indicates bad hinting, save for perhaps the treatment of the
    B across weights. That\u2019s nitpicking though, and I don\u2019t even know what
    system this is rendered on. Linux? If that is the case, font hinting instructions
    doesn\u2019t work anyway \u2013 the FreeType rendering engine handles all the
    interpretation. \r\n\r\nTypography-wise, if you are setting text at this size,
    you need more contrast between background and text. It would also be wise to track
    the text a little bit, but you cannot do that reliably yet without modifying the
    font file. If you are set on Futura, I would first and foremost set it much larger.
    5 pixels to the x-height is miniscule."
