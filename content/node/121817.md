    on Thai versions of Hollywood movie posters, I find it really fascinating that
    they'd choose to use not a single Thai letter for such a national occasion. Clearly
    all these glyphs are Latin characters reappropriated (with one modification, the
    V is stretched asymetrically to form \u0E07.) I just love the unapologetic way
    the parenthesis and comma are used for the vowel mark \u0E34 and tail of \u0E0D
    respectively, it's just so naive and cheeky, and bizarre! I need to think some
    more about this.\r\n\r\n"

    sort of faux-Latin Thai were used for text typography, even if the people of Siam
    were able to read it, I doubt it would fly.\r\n\r\nThe Indic scripts, although
    very diverse visually, approach isomorphism in structure - most of them can be
    used to write Sanskrit, although they may include additional letters for that
    purpose not used in writing the languages to which they belong.\r\n\r\nOne could
    imagine, therefore, that eventually one single script might replace the existing
    scripts used from Tibet to Thailand, from Sri Lanka to Laos. I don't think that's
    particularly likely, as a common script won't do much to surmount the language
    barriers in that region, and in today's age of digital fonts and laser printers,
    it's not as if supporting different scripts is an intolerable economic burden
    somewhere."

    The Thai script is especially adaptable and as we saw this week in the Flickr
    group <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/cross-script-letterforms/pool/\">Cross-script
    letterforms</a>, it can withstand not only Latinisation, but Hangeulisation, Sinification,
    Japaneseification, Bengalification and Devanagarisation. Thai popular culture
    loves imitation, it's not really a question of foreign things being better, rather
    that there are things outside of Thailand that Thais want to appropriate and offer
    their own unique take on. It's more a question of pick'n'mix than pushing things
    in any one direction. That makes it often very indiscriminate and muddled, superficial
    and nonsensical, but also very fast-moving, vibrant, non-judging and fun.\r\n\r\nI
    like the comparison with Morison and wonder about how he would have approached
    Thai. We'll never know of course, but looking at the way he brutalised Greek I
    have some ideas. His approach seems to have been very sober and practical, using
    a repertoire of Latin-ish shapes to compensate for a lack of understanding of
    Greek letterforms. I don't think he would have had the guts or the imagination
    to go anywhere near this far. Yes, this recycled/repurposed Latin Thai is reckless,
    but I find it somehow delightful in its complete abandonment of Thai shapes. In
    a way, they demonstrate such familiarity with Thai letterforms that they can be
    done away with, abstracted so far that they're not there at all: their presence
    must be inferred from the Latin letters that stand in their place. To me, the
    way this is executed is something only a Thai designer could have come up with,
    which paradoxically makes the whole thing quintessentially Thai."

  body: "I can certainly appreciate the benefits of joyful imitation; it's something
    that has made Western cultures richer, hence stronger. I do fear however that
    imitation can be used to [mis]guide discontent. Right now for instance there's
    a vacuum of governance in Thailand, and people in power can use visual language
    to push the country in a political direction that suits them, to the detriment
    of culture. This includes co-opting well-intended imitation to eventually make
    even Thai text fonts copy the forms of Latin with little regard to what they actually
    need to be doing, culturally, functionally.\r\n\r\nBasically to me any design
    effort comes with responsibility, beyond the personal joy it brings. Back when
    I myself used to make Latinized Armenian fonts, I was so happy with and proud
    of my \"formal gymnastics\" of moving shapes around; but then I realized that
    was a very superficial approach and opened my eyes to the damage I was doing,
    without however reverting to the conservatism of blindly reviving tradition. That
    said, it's certainly a tough balancing act, which I will never completely master.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "As I noted in another thread, I'm beginning to get an understanding of what
    is going on. Chanik Aramian apparently came up with the earliest influential Latinized
    Armenian face, and it looks as though he did so because the traditional faces
    seemed to need a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've learned earlier about
    conditions in the diaspora as against the homeland, it looks, though, like there's
    going to be little demand for better Armenian typefaces. The homeland doesn't
    see anything amiss with heavily Latinized faces - they're what they're used to.\r\n\r\n(Although
    the phonetics of Western Armenian, unlike Eastern Armenian, are such that it doesn't
    <em>need</em> all the letters of the Armenian alphabet - Latin would be adequate
    for <em>that</em> version of the language - at least there is no danger of that
    happening. The influence of the church, a naturally conservative institution,
    contributes heavily to the survival of the Armenian language at all in the diaspora.)\r\n\r\nSome
    of the diaspora prefers the traditional faces without change, and some of it apparently
    doesn't mind the Latinized versions. Without demand in the community, expecting
    Monotype or Microsoft or Google to see that anything's wrong is difficult.\r\n\r\nStill,
    typefaces that attempt to meet your goals may sneak in to Google's font collection,
    and <em>maybe</em> they'll even get noticed."

    Asia in general. I know there is a lot of imitation of paintings in China as well.

    the latter half they focus on China.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Thailand's culture

  body: I'd say language skills are a different kettle of fish. More important is
    an understanding of Thai culture (its traditions and its popular culture), design
    trends, especially typographic ones, and a nuanced appreciation of the different
    kinds of Latinisation. That said, it's certainly helpful to be as familiar with
    Thai letterforms as possible, both in the many genres of type and in handwriting.

    that poster. I doubt that it's saying that Latin is \"better\", but it might be
    saying that Latin is more dignified, more suited to contexts where refinement,
    elegance, and prestige are needed.\r\n\r\nThe economic power of the Latin alphabet
    nations mean that a lot of typefaces have been around for it for a long time.
    And the model for capital leters in Latin serif faces... is the Trajan column,
    erected to proclaim an emperor's achievements. So our script is well-adapted to
    announcements on behalf of royalty.\r\n\r\nWhen I see some of the Indic scripts,
    I tend to associate them with the hand-painted signs of small businesses; colorful,
    and following a standard writing model.\r\n\r\nIf one tries to style a script
    to say something else, the Latin script provides a lot of ready-made models. A
    post here, I think by Hrant, showed a link to how this sort of thing can be done

    the link you provided I consider to be about a different principle. It's about
    stylistic translations from one script to the other. Certainly you couldn't call
    the Thai design above a stylistic translation. In fact, there is a total disregard
    for any translation. It simply uses symbols to mean something entirely different.
    It's conversion rather than translation."
