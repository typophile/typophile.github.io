  all occidental alphabets.\r\nAny idea where I could find this ?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nd."

  body: Well, I've noticed that when I open the Windows Character Map for a Type 1
    font, it shows the empty slots for every character in every language ever, with
    descriptions like "Latin Capital T with retroflex hook," "Armenian Small Ligature
    Men Xeh," "Canadian Syllabics West-Cree Nwa," and "Mongolian Todo Soft Hyphen."
    Kind of makes me wonder what they all look like.

  body: "FontLab Studio 5 will come with a coll new way to generate glyphs: just highlight
    an entire Unicode range or encoding range and choose Glyph / Create Glyphs if
    Empty. This will fill in the glyph slots with autogenerated glyphs without the
    need to type in glyph names. \r\n\r\nAlso, FontLab Studio 5 will come with a brand-new
    template glyph image font (the one that shows in the grey background) that covers
    the entire Unicode 3.2 range. \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio 5 for Windows will be released
    soon, with the Mac version to follow later this year. \r\n\r\nAdam"
