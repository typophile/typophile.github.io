  body: "This has a very nice look. \r\n\r\nI think something may be slightly off
    in the rhythm of the letters. This is so nice that it is worth tracking down and
    correcting. I am not sure what it is, as it is subtle, but eg. check if the bd
    etc need to be just a hair wider? Or maybe a spacing issue?  \r\n\r\nOn the terminals.
    Since most of the terminals have a slab serif, I am wondering whether the ends
    of the ce and some of the others without slabs need to be slightly fatter, especially
    in the light weights. (Compare the e in Frutiger and Myriad for some variations.)\r\n\r\nDo
    you think there is a gain in having the top serif on the d 'backwards'? I don't
    see it; it think it's distracting. \r\n\r\nFor me the ascenders and descenders
    on the italic bend too much. "

  body: "Very nice, especially the 'y' and the italic 'w'. Other glyphs as well of
    course, but those caught my eye.\r\n\r\nI agree with William Berkson, that the
    bend of the italic ascenders and descenders might be a bit much. But that's a
    matter of personal taste, I guess. But I don't see a reversed serif on the top
    of the 'd'? Serifs in slab faces usually go 'left' on the 'd'? Or do I misunderstand
    the comment? :)"

    body: "HI,\r\n\r\nAbout the bend of the italic ascenders, I see what you mean,
      but my intention with it was to give it something of calligraphy, inspired in
      gothic fonts (like Duc de Berry) or calligraphy. I wanted to stylize the curved
      ascenders of the calligraphic fonts and combine it with the rigid forms of the
      monolines and slab serifs. Maybe you'r right, but for now I still like it. Hope
      I don't grow tired of it!:)\r\n\r\nAbout the \"d\" serif they usually go left
      on slab faces, and in this one they also go left. But in the light version in
      this pdf it is going right, due to a mistake that escaped my eye. Sorry about
      that. I agree with William Berkson, its distracting when it goes right.\r\n\r\nWilliam
      Berkeson, i think the problem you see in the rhythm is due to the kerning which
      is not perfect. Or maybe the lack of kerning pairs that desappeared when I generated
      the font files (although I whanted it to work with the least kerning pairs as
      possible). I have to work on it.\r\n\r\nThanks."
