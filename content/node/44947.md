  body: I wonder how it looks if you put the first character upright, then rotate
    the next ones incrementally :)

  body: Hi Theunis-Thanks!- I did try this but I am unsure how to rotate the letters.
    I did the 2 above by using free transform to give it a bit of perspective-but
    when i did them all they looked dis-proportional. I dont think there is a 3d tool
    in the version of illustraor im using? Any hints?

  body: "Whether Mesquite or another font, one problem is that your letters are flat.
    That is, if you look at it 90\xB0 rotated, it\u2019ll be invisible. Adding a third
    dimension to your grilled letters might help."
