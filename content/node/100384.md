    post content like this on the <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/4\">General
    Discussion board</a></strong>. The Blogs section tends to be for, well, blogging
    and the like. People don\u2019t really look here for such information as you have
    posted, so it will most certainly get missed by >90% of the community. If you
    have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me directly at typographer@gmail.com.
    And remember; May the Fonts be with you\u2122."
