  body: "The font looks like Arabella designed by A. Drescher (1936) (see Jaspert's
    'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces'). The 'L' in the book is like the sample, but the
    sample's G has an added flourish on the tail, compared to the showing in the book.
    This might have been an added detail.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
