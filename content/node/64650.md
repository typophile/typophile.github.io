  trying to ID this. It's like Kabel and Geometric 231 but not because the ear of
  the \"g\" is diagonal and the \"L\" has a tail.\r\n\r\nAnyone know what typeface
  this is?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: While Adobe's version of Kabel has a much smaller x-height, ITC Kabel Book
    (also from Adobe) appears to be identical to the font on the canisters in the
    photo... except for the tail on the l, as you note. However, some fonts come with
    alternate versions of some characters - and sometimes a font will be used for
    a purpose like advertising, and an individual character in the font will be altered.

  body: "I think in the case of Kabel/ITC Kabel Adobe is just reselling Linotype\u2019s
    versions and doesn\u2019t have an actual version of its own. Concerning x-height
    there are basically two Kabels. The original one by Koch and the one from ITC
    with the typical large x-height, which seems to be the one in the sample."
