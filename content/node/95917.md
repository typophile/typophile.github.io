  seen this numeral design on a number of old clocks (this one is IKEA, but I own
  a Crate and Barrel one that\u2019s virtually identical), but I\u2019ve never seen
  the numbers anywhere else. Anyone know where they\u2019re from?"

    this is a clock face.\r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I find that when the
    hour hand of a clock reaches the ring of numerals, it makes it hard to tell which
    is the hour hand and which is the minute hand. This is especially true when the
    clock uses Roman numerals, as the minute hand blends into the I's.\r\n\r\nNot
    only does this clock use Arabic numerals, but the numerals are (or at least seem
    to be) designed to stay out of the way of the hour hand. Why else would the 10
    be compressed like the 10 in a deck of cards? Not that this is not done for the
    12, as there is no need. And the numerals seem designed to be as big, bold, and
    easy to read as possible within reason and within the limits of this design constraint."
