  body: The good news is it's not illegible at all. The bad news is that it's also
    not classic, sophisticated, mature, serious, nor traditional either.

  body: "Fair comments. I think what bothers me about it, is that I'm not satisfied
    leaving the font to do all the work and feel obligated to alter it in some way
    to make it more \"ownable\" and unique. Hmmm, I think I'll be presenting this
    to the client as a challenge since they also want to differentiate themselves
    from their competitors.\r\n\r\nAdditional comments welcome!"

  body: "I like the font. Is it the same like they currently use?\r\nMaybe adjust
    the kerning between /N/ & /E/ making the vertical line lighter than for the /L/.
    (The horizontal lines in the /E/ let it appear heavier than it is)\r\n\r\nOn a
    different note, if you have a look at their website a sans serif, could be possible
    as well.\r\nI tried the logo in a stencil sans serif\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LANE_3909.png]"

  body: "I think you guys are spot on...Something felt off-balance about it even though
    the vertical stroke of the \"E\" matched the thickness of the \"L\". Here it is
    thinned out. Now that it is more consistent with the angled stroke of the \"N\"
    it flows better. Did I take it too far though? Now the \"L\" feels a little heavy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LANE2_3789.png]\r\n\r\nemanuer,\r\nNot
    sure what website you are referring to? This is for a new company (no website
    yet). I ruled out the sans-serifs early on as I believe the serif font better
    communicates the brand attributes listed. They want a sophisticated boutique feel.\r\n\r\nThank
    you so much for the comments."

  body: "I think the changes on the thickness of the E have helped. But is the spacing
    between the A and the N looking a little tight? I might try increasing it a little.\r\n\r\nOn
    the whole I wonder if having the type tracked so tightly is the right approach
    though. It might be an idea to go the other way and space the letters out. It
    could give the wordmark a more indulgent, expansive feel, which may give it a
    more classic, sophisticated look, whereas at the moment it's looking slightly
    edgy, especially with those sharp serifs.\r\n\r\nHope that helps"

  body: "Merging letter together is not very original, the word itself is fairly common,
    and most importantly there's also this lump of whitespace between L and A. If
    anything, letters should better be pushed apart rather than together to help balancing
    the whitespace.\r\n\r\nHave you considered something along <a href=\"http://www.chopeh.com/work/danzk/\">these
    lines</a>? \r\n"

    I just wanted to give then an option for something edgier/unique.

    The whitespace mostly. How about matching the E stem to the N stem? '

  body: "Igdesign,\r\nI thought it is a new logo for the site [[http://www.lanefurniture.com/]]\r\n\r\nAbout
    the Weight of /N/ /E/, I agree it it may be a bit too tight now.\r\nAnother point
    is the /A/ /N/. The horizontal line of the /N/ crates an optical illusion which
    lets the end stroke of the /A/ appear to be asymmetrical, although it is perfect.
    An explanation of what I mean is here: [[http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm|Crossed
    lines can appear broken]]\r\n\r\nI personally find the logo suggested by apankrat
    beautiful. Although I don't know how versatile it is. \r\nYour current logo proposal
    will be perfectly identifiable at small sizes, business cards, letter heads, etc. "

  body: "Apankrat, thanks for the recommendation. I tried it (quickly) and especially
    like how the the \"L\" and \"A\" link up but I'm afraid this wouldn't work well
    in real-world use for us. I will certainly bookmark that technique for future
    use!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LANE3_3549.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrode,
    No harm done. This is an experiment for me. I did try using the stem of the \"N\"
    early on and it definitely doesn't work.\r\n\r\nemanuer, No furniture...IT Services/staffing
    firm. Great type design reference. I think I have been able to address that illusion
    as well as balance out the neg/positive space better. May continue to refine if
    this is chosen, but here is where I netted out:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LANE4_5543.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LANE5_6330.png]"

  body: Wait, it is for IT services?  I don't understand how your keywords fit at
    all.  And I think the vanishing thin strokes idea has great potential.  Work with
    the joins between the letters, and the relationship between the 2 diagonal strokes.  Maybe
    try some totally different ideas too.

    you are probably thinking of. The business development has been put on hold now
    so I won't be working on this anymore. Thanks again for all the input. Got a lot
    out of it.

  body: It's actually quite readable, at least at this size range it is. You may have
    a bit of trouble when you really scale it down, though, but otherwise you're fine.
    Legibilitiy issues aside, though, you're going to need to add something more to
    this in order to achieve all of the things you listed there.
