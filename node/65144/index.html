  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everybody!

I would need a font for my thesis, I don't need to use Times but the qualifications need to be: "similar" to Times: traditional serif, classic, high legibility.

It is an social science thesis, but it deals with more technical climate issues as well, so it can't be too playful. Italics are a must. 

Built-in fonts on Mac OS X:
Baskerville, Hoefler Text, Palatino, Times (&NR),  Georgia, Garamond (not as tall as Adobe Garamond or other cuts)

Freeware fonts I like:
Bergamo. Day Roman (italics and bold then in Garamond), Lido, Efont Serif, Gentium, Calluna (+ paying for italics)
<a href='http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/4862/screenshot20091208at100.jpg'>
<strong>Overview table</strong> for comparison, rendered by Mac PDF function (Quartz?)</a><br/>

Out of the presented I think I <strong>Calluna</strong> most, but would it be suitable for a thesis?

<li>Which of these fonts provides the best balance between seriousness, legibility and a warmer touch? How does it work in a long printed text?
<li> Do you think I should rule out a font with Old Style Figures? I will have a lot of quotes (Harvard System, 1984 p.999) within the text body. I prefer proportional Lining Figures.
<li> Which sans (neo-grotestk or humansit) would go with the serif you suggest? I have the system fonts (Helvetica, Geneva, Gill Sans, Futura) and some free ones (Aller, Museo, DejaVu Sans, Quicksand, Fontin, Delicious, Segeo UI – MS Frutiger Copy).
.


I would love to use Sabon or Arno, but well... to expensive for me.

I know this is a somehow tiring question, but I hope for your help anyhow. :)
Thank you very much for reading and commenting.

Florian</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Arno is only $35 per weight, Sabon even less. You don’t need the full family for a thesis. 

Old style figures are designed to be used with running text, lining figures are designed to be used with capitals. 

If you want to pair a sans serif with a serif I suggest having a look at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/32056?">this link</a>.

Good luck! :)

I'm using Xetex, with the KOMA-Script bundle, which is "supposed" to follow Bringhurst's ideas (or does it not?), and with all "niceties" available (oldstyle figures, ligatures). The results are nice, but after some time I stopped using Cronos for titles and changed for Arno for the whole text. The only question that remains is: does Arno match my subject (Islam) after all?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I would like to change discussion a bit towards another direction. Thank you so much for your input here, I think I will look for a first typeface to buy, and since this is a special thing, especially with limited funds, I would be interested in your input.

I read the "Choosing a font for book design?" thread, so I am aware of the fonts there.

I would prefer a font which was created for the digital time already in mind... if that plays a role. Something classic looking, easy to ready, serif, but still somehow new, fresh and a bit warm. Serif of course.
I need a roman and a italic version, and it shouldn't be too expensive. 
OpenType would be good, so I can use the Small Caps function of my Wordeditor program.
The font would be needed for longer texts, essays, PDFs (and this must be possible with the EULA - sorry MVB Verdigris), basically everything I would write and print or distribute otherwise. 

Are there any suggestions besides what I would consider so far, which is:
<li>Sabon – maybe a tad to traditional, but very homogeneous in appearance, my favorite Garamond.  
<li>Janson Text – looks good, but is it really well digitalized? After W and Y there are big gaps, aren't there?
<li>Minon – Really like it, has the right mix of everything, though maybe a bit to narrow?
<li>Andron – I like it more than Arno ;) :D Though maybe a tad to classic
<li>Eudald News, Edita, Whitman, Farnham – Anybody any experience with it? How do they compare with Minon and Janson? Would be interested in all these rather new fonts.

Basically I guess I would be looking for something in between Minion and Janson, if that makes sense. I like about Minion that the letters seem all to match very nicely, everything flows into each other, the x-height is somehow right, but it looks a bit to dark maybe and to narrow. 
Janson looks quite nice, somehow it is not a too far strech from Sabon for my eyes (don't know about their tradition), but less old-school. However I feel that with Janson Text the relationship of the space between the letters are not really perfect.

I hope you see what I would be looking for?
And any experience with the latter four would be interesting to hear.

thanks!

I like Calluna and I think I probably will get the italics and maybe bold anyhow, With Calluna, maybe I am a bit to conservative in regards to the punctuation marks and the q and the p, I guess the "fresh" approach I am looking for in an all-round font is something a tiny bit more "edgy", a tiny bit less "warm".

@ ycherem:
I am by far not an expert about the origins of Arno, apart from the buzz-word "Venetian". But I can tell you that Renaissance in Europe was partly triggered due to Arabic/Byzantine influence in Europe with Islamic scholars studying the ancient Greek and Latin philosophers and continental Europeans rediscovered them due to this influence. So maybe Arno is not too off after all ;)</div>

Cycles is perfect for my use I think. I am sorry for all the designers here, Jos and Andreas, I love your fonts, they truly impressed me, I like Andron even more then Arno and I am sure it will find its way to me in some time. And I truly love Calluna, it is a great modern font, a certain future buy. :) Congrats to both of you for your success.

For my purpose Cycles 11 is a great font and weight, it looks beautiful and is easy to read and well balanced, looks traditional without being too orthodox about its traditions. ;)

		<div class="commentbody">I enjoyed this discussion of high commitment very much. It’s the dream of a font designer to come in contact with users who consider the quality of type on that level.

As a summary, would you care to produce a little comparative specimen, showing Calluna, Andron, Arno, Cycles, ... whatsoever, with the same bit of text at same size?
Would be a nice conclusion to this thread.

I wish you success for your thesis!</div>

I hadn't thought about that connection... It just helped me to make up my mind. I had tried Warnock before, there is a book by Hamid Dabashi "Iran, a people interrupted" which looked great on Warnock, but when printed I guess paper and printer I used (average laser + a4 paper) didn't make a good impression. My two other options, Minion and Sabon, though great, didn't look as sharp (if that's the proper typographical term). I was one in love with Sabon, but now it seems rather cozy, too "round", and Minion looks a bit "squared". By contrast, the "coldness" of the sharp and slim forms of Arno, perhaps due to the fact that it was based on handwriting (a mix of Brioso and Minion), somehow makes me remember swords or metalblades, which is great, specially my subject(s).</div>

It is not really established in general knowledge how big the influence of the near&middle east area was during the middle ages for Europe. In math to medicine to philosophy there was a lot of research and a rich culture of literature, while in Europe a lot of knowledge was not lost bot somehow sleeping and it was a lot due to this influence that Europe started off again. No wonder the Renaissance draws on the antique, because this was exactly the knowledge brought back from Byzantine to Europe.  

@ Andres:
Sound like a good idea, let's see. 

Since you say for you as a type designer it is interesting what the type loving customers think I will tell my criteria in this special search. 

I was mostly comparing the overall look of the textbody and how easy it is to cut through the text. The individual shapes matter in so far, as they contribute to a round and harmonic image of the textbody and are in balance with the other ones and of course as well look somehow nice by themselves. But I didn't inspect any letter close up or anything.

If anybody is interested in my totally amateurish thoughts on individual fonts:

<li> Minion: close to perfect, a bit to narrow, dense, and it could be a bit rounder, but I would like to have this font later. Great to read.
<li> Sabon: Totally different from Minion, but as well almost perfect, coming form the other, the softer side. This font made me fall in love with type though and I think is one of the most beautiful fonts and the best Garamond. I am not sure if the spaces between letters is always balanced, maybe SabonNext is better here.
<li> Andron: I think it is somehow between (rounder than) Minion and (less traditional maybe... than) Arno and I like it better than Arno. It is less dark, a bit milder, looks very nice and sophisticated, should definitely be a serious consideration. Maybe update the website or make a parallel international one, just focus on the font? I like the sites of <a href="http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html">Jos</a> and <a href="http://www.type-together.com/index.php">type together</a> a lot. Maybe they are to "pop" for Andron, but I hope this font gains more recognition. A free roman font is a good thing. :)
<li> Calluna: I like it a lot, it is sweet and modern, somehow a bit radical and still graceful. I think Jos Buivenga produces good typos like crazy ;)
<li> I like as well Baskerville and Hoefler Text, but those coming with mac are for my purposes either to limited (I need OSF and LF) or are not the best cuts for body text, in my personal opinion. A closer look on Whitman and Eudald News might be interesting.

Alright, so much about it. I an overview table might follow. :)

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, paypal was loaded and charged, so yes, I got my first font ;)

I made two comparison tables, the first with a list of good serifs I have access too, and every student should be interested in, and the second one with the specimen of Arno from Adobe. 

<a href="http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/6104/comparison2.jpg"><img src="http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/6104/comparison2.jpg" /><strong>Baskerville, Cycles, Calluna, Times, Andron and Hoefler</strong></a><br/>

Arno, Cycles and Andron in comparison. **edited out link**

a complete Family for 69 $ or some 45€. Now this is a bargain every student should be able to afford ;)

I have to say though it is impressive what both Calluna and Andron are able to do. Calluna is beautiful as well, not far away actually from Cycles. One thing I notice about Calluna is that the top curves of round small letters (a, b, c, e, g, h, m, n, o, p, r) is very similar and regular, which is even more obvious because of the "direction" Jos put there. This is not a good or bad thing, I don't know, I guess it has two effects: the image of the text becomes more homogenic, but maybe there is less for the eye to hold onto. I don't know, was just an interesting observation for me. Anyhow I think the comparison to Cycles shows that Calluna is a very high quality font. As the comparison Andron/Arno gives a similar results about Andron. 

At least for my unprofessional eye. ;)

Congrats to the good designers here on the board. I am happy so far, hope others are interested in this thread. :)

Would you mind to change this sample and avoid these false small capitals, please? Though you mention the trick the visual impression is inevitably unfavourable. Especially in a comparison as fancy as this. Danke!

		<div class="commentbody">Sure, no harm done I hope. Well here is the Andron Freefont against the Adobe specimen of Arno and the Cycles font:
<a href="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/7756/arnoandroncycles.jpg"><strong>Arno - Andron - Cycles</strong></a>. 

And the 69$ are for the family of Cycles eleven, which consist of roman LF/OSF/SC, italics LF/OSF and semi-bold LF/OSF. Available at the website of <a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com">Stone Type Foundry</a>. This is a very competitive price if you don't need a stronger bold or bold italics, I can understand that it might raises concern.

From my side there is not much more to say at this topic. :) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">today, a few month later, I found out that there is such a thing as Apple Advanced Typography and Hoefler Text is one of the very few fonts supporting this feature. The only reason why I did not chose Hoefler Text was because of the old style figures it has as default. In Apple Pages one can though activate lining figures for Hoefler Text. So basically if I knew this earlier, I wouldn't need to go that much into the details of typography and different serifs. Well, I am more informed now. On the other hand writing a thesis with Apple Pages is not fun either.

		<div class="commentbody">thank you so much for this thread, it helps so much in deciding on a font for my own thesis (on english book illustration between 1866 and 1907).

I think I am going to use Andron for the main text, I love that it is dark and not too tall. However I would like to use a different sans serif font for the titles. Any suggestions on a font that would go well with Andron? If it had small caps, that would be a plus, though I haven't yet decided as to whether or not I am going to set the titles in SC.

Thank you so much in advance for your help and suggestions, it's really appreciated.</div>
