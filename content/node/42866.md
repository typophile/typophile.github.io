  is going to take place in 2 weeks, and I was wondering if anyone knows the fonts
  that were used in this poster? It appears to be something along the lines of \"futuristic,\"
  \"retro,\" and \"something of 80's style.\" If anyone can find them, I would really
  appreciate it. Thanks! :D\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jwdoctnovflyerweb_3498.jpg]"
