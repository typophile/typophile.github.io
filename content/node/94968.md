  />\r\nan unusual typographic experiment designed to explore the relationship between
  graphic design, typography and the reading of a page. [it] collects the responses
  of 70 international graphic designers when posed with the same brief \u2013 to design
  and lay out the first page of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, a text chosen
  in part because it directly references lettering as Pip searches for clues about
  his family from the letterforms inscribed on their tombstone. The brief encouraged
  the 70 contributors to explore, challenge or celebrate the conventions of book typography.
  Each layout is accompanied by a short rationale explaining the designer\u2019s decision-making
  process.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the text, here is a relevant
  passage:\r\n<blockquote>As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any
  likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs),
  my first fancies regarding what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their
  tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he
  was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn
  of the inscription, \"Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,\" I drew a childish conclusion
  that my mother was freckled and sickly. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhoops\u2026 I forgot

  body: "Interesting. There was another famous example along similar lines (though
    nowhere near as extensive) back in 1968 when six well-known book designers were
    invited by Hammermill Paper Company to design Kafka\u2019s <cite>The Trial</cite>.
    A comparison of the results was published as <cite>The Trial of Six Designers</cite>."

  body: I suppose the 1968 experiment could be seen as even more interesting by the
    fact that the design was for the whole novel!

    done i've experienced a great opportunity for 'playfulness' (if that's even the
    right word) within such rigid confines. The Trial of Six Designers is up on my
    search list tomorrow for sure.\r\n\r\nn."
