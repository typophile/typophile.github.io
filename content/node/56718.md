body: "Nice to meet you all. I'm a growing typo-addicts and wish to acquire some knowledge
  based on this typeface. I wish this question wasn't brought onto the forum before
  and hopefully it isn't a sensitive subject, as the topic is a fairly censored conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  was browsing fonts for a better knowledge of san-serifs and I laid my eyes on this
  typeface.\r\n\r\nIt is really interesting of how Robert Slimbach created this typeface
  with such a calligraphic influence. I believed it is one of favorites for typefaces
  I may use in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon further research of Slimbach, I found out
  that he was obsessed with revivals and calligraphic nature of the older typefaces
  such as Garamond. However, a lot of books and information online did not mention
  how he concludes his design on cronos.\r\n\r\nThen I ran into an invisible filter
  that covers all the backgrounds of this typeface. I did not found out much but supposedly
  it was a copy of the typeface, Today San Serif, by Scangraphic. Yet Adobe declared
  Cronos was an original face developed by Slimbach himself.\r\n\r\nI wish to find
  out more information about this typeface and its relationship with the \"original\"
  and the \"Slimbach's version\". I hope the fellow typographers can direct me to
  some books or other sources to find out more information. \r\n\r\nThanks you for
  your time!"

    Slimbach, who joined Adobe in 1987, began working seriously on type and calligraphy
    four years earlier in the type drawing department of Autologic in Newbury Park,
    California. Since then, he has concentrated primarily on designing text faces
    for digital technology, drawing inspiration from classical sources. In 1991, he
    received the Prix Charles Peignot from Association Typographique Internationale
    for excellence in type design. Slimbach now directs Adobe's type design program.
    He has designed typefaces for the International Typeface Corporation, as well
    as the Adobe\xAE Originals families Arno\u2122, Brioso\u2122, Caflisch Script\xAE,
    Cronos\xAE, Adobe Garamond\xAE, Garamond Premier, Adobe Jenson\xAE, Kepler\xAE,
    Minion\xAE, Poetica\xAE, Sanvito\xAE, Utopia\xAE, Warnock\xAE, and Myriad\xAE
    (co-designed with Carol Twombly).\r\n\r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayDesignerInfo&code=SLIM&store=OLS-US\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated
    by Adobe type designer Robert Slimbach, Cronos is a new sans serif typeface family
    that embodies the warmth and readability of oldstyle roman typefaces. Because
    it derives much of its appearance from the calligraphically inspired type of the
    Italian Renaissance, Cronos has an almost handwritten appearance, setting it apart
    from most other sans serif designs and making it an effective choice for text
    composition. The italic design was inspired by early chancery style italics and
    is both elegant and distinguished. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1733\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'My local Giant supermarket switched over to Chronos for all their signage.
    I don''t know about its relationship to Today, but I find it a little annoying,
    though generally I''m a big fan of Slimbach. Is it just me, or do others see some
    kind of forced or false bonhomie about it. To me its softness feels laid-on, rather
    than organic. Of course the whole thing is very well drawn, but I still find it
    off-putting.  '

    way). If you go on google book or something and search his name, there are a lot
    of mini-articles about him. I've read through his research on Garamond and Jenson,
    they are very fascinating to me. That he actually traveled around europe to find
    original prints and cuts, then redraw them, then, again, uses the historic calligraphic
    knowledge of his to determine Garamond's italics.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, he's awesome
    like that in my opinion, haha.\r\n"
