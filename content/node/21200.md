  two different fonts, but the largest one is the most important.\r\nit is a screenshot
  from an old game by Westwood.\r\ni would need a similar one as alternative or if
  possibly the exact one and, if free, it would be better, as it would be used for
  a non profit game translation.\r\nit could come also in a different format than
  bitmap, as i would rasterize it then.\r\nany suggestion?\r\nthanks! :) "

  body: The bold font is an old Mac bitmap font called Venice. The lighter one (in
    red) is similar to another old Mac font called Alice that was distributed with
    the Mac game of the same name (Apple's only commercial Mac game ever, as far as
    I know), though it may just be something else.
