body: Hello and sorry or my bad English. I have a huge problem. I'm working on a logo.
  Whenever I want to create outlines in Illustrator the fonts are getting bolder and
  are ruining the design. Is there a solution for this? Thank you very very much!

  body: Drawing programs like Illustrator and CorelDraw render vector artwork differently
    from the way they render text, and type always appears heavier when converted
    to outlines (in my experience). Either choose a lighter weight of the typeface,
    or add a white stroke to your converted outlines.

  body: Are you converting a TrueType font to outlines? I have had some (understandably)
    bad experiences converting the curves in TrueType fonts to Postscript outlines
    in Illustrator. You can always try putting the type in one color on one layer,
    the outlines on a higher layer in a different color, and then adjust the outlines
    to match the type.

  body: You should check if Illustrator adds a line thickness to your outline, instead
    of just filling the outline.

  body: "The STROKE window (pallette) will show whether you have a stroke with thickness
    or not. Alternatively you can change the colour of the stroke to \u2018none\u2019
    in the COLOUR pallette (that's the option in the lower left corner \u2014 a box
    with a red diagonal stroke in it)."

    The only solution is to not convert to outlines or to compensate with a graded
    version of the font or add a hack white hairline stroke. \r\n"
