body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a magazine for an organisation that has it's own
  font. It's a very limited font in that it only has two weights and only uses uppercase
  (except the 'y' which appears to be unicase. It's a bit in the style of Conduit/Din
  (caps), but with some personal flavors.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is about professional
  sports. For the magazine redesign I would like to introduce a similar or a complimentary
  sans serif or slab serif font but with more variation in weights and of course lower
  case. It could be used for captions, pull quotes etc. It's not for the body since
  they employ Melior for that. l experimented a bit with Gridnik and Blender, but
  I think they are too square.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TD_type_5104.jpg]"
