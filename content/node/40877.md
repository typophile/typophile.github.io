body: "Can anyone point me in the direction of some good examples of Church Newsletters,
  or similar that are also well designed. I am looking to do some work on a monthly
  newsletter for a local church and I am looking for inspiration.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
  I am looking to develop a very informal/handwritten approach that feels 'friendly'
  and maybe a little 'haphazard' rather than one which is 'clean' and 'well presented'.
  I want the newsletter to convey a 'small community' feel that is 'developing' and
  'learning' together, so I want the newsletter to 'look and feel' a bit quirky.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any suggestions for a handwritten/script font that is versatile enough to cope
  with a newsletter approach?\r\n\r\nAs you have probably all guessed by now, I am
  new to all this, but love the art of words, that so many of you here make look so
  easy and yet I know is the product of so much learning.\r\n\r\nI'm just wanting
  to get started, and looking for ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChris"
