  continues to plauge me and, now that I am realatively pleased with the roman form
  and am taking a break from the italic, I&#39;ve started in on a condensed version.
  I&#39;ll make a better sample sheet soon, but for comparision here are six &#39;graphs
  set in both the normal and condensed widths. The condensed feels a little too narrow
  for lots of text, but I can&#39;t decide if it is that all of the glyphs are too
  condensed or if specific ones are to blame. Any feedback would be great. I feel
  as though the serifs have suffered a bit, though I have tweaked them.<!--attachment:

  body: '&#62; The condensed feels a little too narrow for lots of text <BR> <BR>Well,
    it&#39;s supposed to be!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>If you want to cast it as an <i>alternative</i>
    to the &#34;normal&#34; one for text, then I think you have a problem because
    the normal one is already on the narrow side &#40;although it&#39;s also too loose&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>But if you decide to go for it: <BR>1&#41; Call it Narrow instead of
    Condensed. <BR>2&#41; Make it maybe about halfway between where it is now and
    the normal one. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: First I&#39;m told its too tight, then I loosen it, now its too loose. Arrrgh.
    Is there a rule of thumb I don&#39;t know about?

  body: 'No rule of thumb&#42;, just eyeballing refined over time. Observe, measure,
    think, all the time. Or if you&#39;re going to listen to other people&#39;s advice,
    learn to gauge what they mean by things like &#34;a fair amount&#34; versus &#34;slightly&#34;
    versus &#34;a hair&#34;. :-&#41; But whatever you do, note this: it&#39;s quite
    amazing how <i>small</i> adjustments need to be to make sense in type design -
    I think even seasoned designers are periodically humbled by the degree of subtley
    required. <BR> <BR>&#42; Although I can imagine somebody one day coming up with
    a killer formula that balances color, spacing, contrast, proportions, intended
    size, etc. Sort of like PV=nRT in chemistry. Of course it could never be so exact,
    but it could save a lot of time by immediately putting you in the ballpark. <BR>
