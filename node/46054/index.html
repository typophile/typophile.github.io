I learnt on Freehand, went out to the real world and they all said freewhat?... thank goodness I knew Quark (the battle tank, it is like driving a battle tank), Illustrator was easy to pick up, got me a job over 100 other young designers.

The more I use Illustrator CS3 the more I wish Adobe would have just killed Illustrator and gone with Freehand.

Completely agree - I'm very annoyed at being forced to migrate to a horrible overweight lumbering, flaccid vector program from Freehand which was pretty much perfect for actually drawing things.  </div>

A manager I had at an old job used to call it Ragemaker... :-D

Sometimes, if a client has created a job in Pagemaker and just needs to have some text updated, or translated, you have to stick with the application it was created in. But I know Adobe was encouraging Pagemaker users to switch to InDesign a couple of years ago... <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/">They had (or have) some sort of discount if you switched/upgraded to InDesign.</a> Besides, they stopped upgrading PM after version 7, if I'm not mistaken.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've always liked PageMaker and still occasionally use it to generate some book documents. I keep it on an older G4 along with other orphaned Mac software such as Streamline and Adobe Type Manager (for creating Multiple Master instances). 

InDesign (beginning with CS2) can convert PageMaker docs without problem except that it wipes out the kerning (actually a blessing). 

I wouldn't call PM "crappy software." As I recall it WAS the page-layout program that started it all and has gotten us here today. Hmmm? I've done an awful lot of work with it and, quite frankly, typography and design have nothing to do with software. I've handset a lot of books in metal type as well so I think I could suggest that the execution of typography and design are also hardly dependent upon the newer than the newest technology.

I do love working with InDesign (never liked Illustrator) but I can certainly do my work without it if need be.

Fireworks and Dreamweaver are now getting the CS make over. Acrobat is in a different building I think.

Any issues with Illustrator ask me (+ others)and see if I can help. Would like to make it easy for you.</div>

I wish Adobe would make a bare bones set of apps that only did the basics and cut the filters etc. Illustrator 3.X was very nice and lean but the postscript was rough.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't understand what everyone's problems with Illustrator are, I love it myself.

The only things I hate about it are how it's text handling has just died in the last few years.  Trying to manipulate text on Illustrator CS3 is like pulling teeth sometimes.  

And I absolutely hate that saved files have all the space hogging PDF crap tacked onto them.  I've saved files with and without PDF compatibility before and the size reduction from saving without PDF compatibility has been huge sometimes—I remember one file was almost 18 megs with the PDF crap attached and without it went down to under a couple megs.  But if you save without the PDF compatibility you also lose the icon preview in the OS so it's one or the other.  Despite the fact that hard drives are very large now I do like to save space when I can.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Freehand is great, I love the way it sets type. Freehand does some great things, its gradient tool is awesome. How about this crazy, multiple size pages within a document? Wow1
I wish someone bought Freehand. Adobe has killed some great software in the past, did they ever really do anything with FrameMaker? I'm not knocking Adobe, cause I love postscript, but outside of that and Illustrator, they have really just bought the pieces to the puzzle, kinda like the dude who retired today up in Washington.
