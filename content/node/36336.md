  from graphic illustrations of tree branches.\r\n\r\nI found an antique (Victorian?)
  version that's very ornate and detailed, but the one I'm searching my memory banks
  for is cleaner, more graphic and modern -- possibly even a 50s typeface.\r\n\r\nIdeas?
  Thanks!"

    I may have improved it by not seeing it for so long!\r\n\r\nTender(leaf) definitely
    not, but that actually may end up working for what I have in mind...\r\n\r\nThanks,
    guys."
