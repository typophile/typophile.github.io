  I thought I'd ask some of the UI and programming geniuses on here if you'd had a
  chance to play with Android yet.\r\n\r\nHow powerful is it?\r\n\r\nIs it capable
  to be used as a fully functioning non-mobile OS on it's own?\r\n\r\nIf so (and if
  not) how does it handle type rendering as compared to others?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly...do
  you think Android can potentially change how we view operating systems, mobile devices
  (or even other devices like e-Readers)?"

  body: From the fonts side, some custom TrueType fonts developed by Ascender, rendered
    using FreeType - nice, but not exactly revolutionary.

  body: "I'm not a developer, but as a UI designer I have had a chance to play with
    Android in action on the G1.\r\n\r\nDespite the poor visual design (and interaction
    for that matter), Android itself has a lot of potential and can be a very powerful
    system if the right people get their hands on it.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't know a
    lot about the development side of things, but it is my understanding Android has
    a unique rendering engine for type, though apparently has some difficulty with
    many TrueType fonts (if you were to install your own) - other than Droid, which
    is currently the default used on the G1.(It is also important to note that processing
    speeds of the hardware can be an obstacle for the OS)\r\n\r\nHere are a couple
    of resources:\r\nhttp://androidguys.com/?p=656\r\nhttp://understandinglimited.com/2009/03/07/android-complex-script/"

    documentation (http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html)
    says it uses FreeType - maybe with a twist? FreeType is currently developed by
    Google employees. \r\n\r\n"
