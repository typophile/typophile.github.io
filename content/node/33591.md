  <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/35/100101879_7d9663dd44_o.jpg\">here</a>.
  The design was finished in 1909 (funnily enough around the same time neon signs
  came about... maybe it was designed to easily accommodate the glass tubes?) Anyway,
  any leads I can get would be a great help. Thanks! (and sorry my first post here
  is a question...)\r\n\r\n-Sam"
