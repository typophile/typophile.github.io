body: "one of the funnest and hardest parts of my job is choosing a typeface, I always
  love getting advice from the experts on this forum.\r\n\r\nThe stories are: \r\n\r\n1)'The
  Wall' by Jean-Paul Sartre (story takes place in Spain during Spanish Civil War):I
  was thinking Le Monde Livre.\r\n\r\n2)'Olalla' by Robert Louis Stevenson: Having
  trouble with this one, I tried Bookman Oldstyle but hated it, the story takes place
  in Spain and Bookman didnt feel right, maybe something from Mario Feliciano?\r\n\r\n3)'The
  Stolen White Elephant' by Mark Twain: I was thinking Century Expanded \r\n\r\nThe
  text will be 9pt\r\n\r\nThanks"

    ) would be ideal, especially for Stevenson, who was a Scotsman. Sartre is another
    matter, entirely: anyone know any good existential or absurdist fonts?'

  body: "Just checked my copy of <em> los a\xF1os del dise\xF1o: La d\xE9cada republicana</em>
    by Enric Satu\xE9, and Franco-era typography seems to follow the trends prevalent
    in the rest of Europe at the time, meaning Art Deco styles in headlines and Futura
    (or its equivalents) in body text."

    text of Canada Type's specimen book is a story by Stephen Leacock (early 20th
    century Canadian humorist), which runs throughout, changing font as it goes. Most
    of them are quite decorative, and Ronaldson, which is similar in tone to Rowan
    Oak, particularly appropriate. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/"
