body: 'Hey there! <BR> <BR>Forgive any noobie questions, but I&#39;m at a bit of a
  loss and I don&#39;t know where to turn... Here&#39;s my situation: <BR> <BR>I work
  for a book publishing company. We&#39;ve set up a system where researchers enter
  information into an online database which we can then export, import into Quark,
  run some formatting programs, and have a fully-formatted book. The only thing that&#39;s
  holding us up is handling icons.  <BR> <BR>Currently, we have to hand-place icons
  in the book. I would like to fully-automate the process by creating a custom font
  that has these icons in it. Then all I&#39;d have to do is have the database spit
  out a string of letters and the row of icons would pop up, correctly spaced and
  formatted. <BR> <BR>If the icons were vector, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any
  troubles. However, since the icons are hand drawn and do not lend themselves to
  vector design, I need to do them as bitmaps. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m running into
  troubles. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using Fontographer, and I&#39;ve figured out how to create
  the necessary bitmap version of the icons, but whenever I export the font and try
  to use it, the bitmap doesn&#39;t show up. It&#39;s as if the program is looking
  for a vector version of the font that doesn&#39;t exist and won&#39;t see the bitmap
  version. <BR> <BR>So basically my question is: is there any way to create a bitmap-only
  font using Fontographer? <BR> <BR>Thanks very much! <BR> <BR>--eric'

  body: What&#39;s Fontographer?  <BR> <BR>If at all, BitFonter should probably be
    your choice for bitmap fonts &#40;<a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/bitfonter.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/bitfonter.html</a> &#41; as it supports
    the widest range of bitmap font formats. However, I think most bitmap fonts work
    on screen, but not necessarily in print.  <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: '&#34;True&#34; bitmap fonts &#40;either stand-alone like FON or NFNT, or
    embedded like in a TT font&#41; have sort of become bastard children, especially
    on the Mac side. Your best bet is to make what are called pixelfonts: outline
    fonts that mimic a bitmap font when used at a certain single point size. They
    contain blocky paths that snap to the &#34;intended grid&#34;, causing the outlines
    to render out exactly as the bitmaps would be. They&#39;re supported better than
    true bitmap fonts because the OSes can&#39;t tell they&#39;re anything besides
    outline fonts and hence can&#39;t discriminate against them. <BR> <BR>Note: another
    option is to use hinting to get an outline font to render well onscreen, but that&#39;s
    a lot more work, although it allows a single font file to address more than one
    size. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>If your application is narrow enough to accomodate
    true bitmap fonts however, you can either use BitFonter to generate a FON&#42;
    file &#40;Adam, is that a supported format?&#41;, or if you&#39;re stuck with
    Fontographer you can generate a BDF, embed it into a dummy &#40;or even legit&#41;
    TrueType font using the SBIT utility &#40;free from MS&#41;, and use that TT file.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; There are cheaper options to do this than BitFonter &#40;possibly
    including other Pyrus products&#41;, but BF is the most complete, powerful true
    bitmap font product out there. <BR> <BR>If you get stuck, and you have a budget
    for consulting, give me a ring, since I&#39;m in LA too.  :-&#62; <BR>818.507.6907

  body: Thanks very much for all your help! It looks like the best bet is for me to
    recreate the icons in Illustrator, since the bitmaps probably won&#39;t look good
    enough for print, no matter what I do. <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone for your input!
    And hhp - I&#39;ll hold onto your number; we may need consulting on other projects
    in the future ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Best,
