  body: Hello Hrant, <BR>Thanks for your message. <BR>If I understand your question,
    I don&#39;t know. But if you want, and If you have a very hi-res display setups,
    I can send you Mister Pixel by email. This font will be free, it&#39;s not a problem.

  body: 'Thanks for the offer! What format would you send it though? I&#39;m [generally]
    on Windows. <BR> <BR>Anyway, what I&#39;m mostly wondering is this: Since this
    is a large design, but with good weight and spacing, how does it function as a
    <i>text</i> font for hi-res displays? I&#39;m hoping John Hudson will chime in.
    <BR> <BR>And the main reason I&#39;m curious is that I&#39;ve been working on
    a similar font since &#39;98, but mine uses grayscaling, so it requires special
    treatmen/usage. It will be released soon. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I&#39;m on a 15inch Powerbook at 1280x845. I don&#39;t know what <BR>that
    is in PPI, but it looks great to me. Too large for body <BR>text, though. Maybe
    not on John&#39;s fancy display. <BR> <BR>The only glyphs that distract are the
    &#39;v&#39; and &#39;w&#39;. Where they <BR>get to be 1 pixel stroke widths it
    looks like a gradient to a <BR>lighter gray. Perhaps you can avoid this with by
    getting <BR>creative with their shapes. <BR> <BR>But as Hrant will tell you, 2-pixel
    stem widths make for <BR>good pixel font readability, so nice job!

  body: At an aspect ratio of 4:3, a 15&#34; screen is 12 inches wide. So your PPI
    is just over 100. BTW, how close to your screen is your head, typically? <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m thinking that a 1600 dpi display on a 15&#34; &#40;~130 PPI&#41; would
    make a 16 PPEM font really sing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I love the font&#39;s quirkiness. It seems like bitmap fonts end up being
    a tad mechanical, but I don&#39;t get this from yours as much. &#40;Of course,
    with 16 pixels high instead of 7-9, it&#39;s easy to add detail.&#41;

  body: '&#62;16 pt on Mac are now in 12 pt on PC <BR> <BR>Christophe, you may be
    running into the 96ppi vs 72ppi display difference on the two platforms. Essentially
    because Windows use 96ppi to figure out how to draw stuff, things come out looking
    smaller than on a Mac. How to get past this problem in producing a font like this
    is beyomd me. Hrant may have some good insight into the size difference and how
    to compensate / allow for it in your production. <BR> <BR>I like this face - it&#39;s
    quite nice, and I think that Hrant may be right: useful for text at high resolutions.

    to use grayscale bitmap fonts all over MacOS. Until then, as reported, they work
    great in Flash and Photoshop. <BR> <BR>The trouble is, there is no cross-platform
    bitmap font standard except TrueType and OpenType pixel fonts. Even MacOS which
    gave us brilliant post-PARC typography &#40;<a href="http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4"
    target="_blank">http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4</a>&#41; has
    now abandoned its bitmap font heritage. shame. Upside is, if they support pixel
    sizes, they have to support pixel fonts. Details to be posted to this board. As
    far as bitmap&#60;-&#62;outline correlation, it may have to be handled by the
    designer, not insensitive operating systems and apps. <BR> <BR>TiD wants to publish
    MR. PIXEL. Qu&#39;en pensezvous M. Badani?
