  What about articles?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen arguments for both. Some say phrases
  with prepositions can\u2019t be broken because that would be against the unnatural
  flow. Others say a headline is better readable if each line makes sense on its own,
  or at least its beginning does.\r\n\r\nExample (nevermind balancing lines, this
  is not the point here):\r\n\r\nAn Act to approve\r\nthe Constitution\r\nof the United
  Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nAn
  Act to approve the\r\nConstitution of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational,\r\nScientific
  and Cultural Organization"
