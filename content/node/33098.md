  body: "> maximebuechi\r\n\r\nI think it's an Americanism for 'Nice', 'Cool', 'Sweet'
    etc.. although it's been lost in translation, there's certainly an irony which
    has been found.\r\n\r\nMy only problem is the illegibility of the address beneath
    'Rick Shaw Stop' due to the stroke on the gothic type combined with the small
    .pt size.\r\n\r\nOther than that its certainly going to draw attention.. I just
    hope it's long enough for people to decipher what it actually says."

    \ Here are two easier-to-read designs by the same guy - thanks for linking his
    work!\r\n\r\n[[http://port.kidhack.com/print08.html]] & [[http://port.kidhack.com/print17.html]]."

  body: 'I don''t know that legibity is the #1 issue with a club flier. I think you
    want people to pick it up - one way to do that is to make them think - ''what''s
    that?''. I think it works.'

  body: "Yes, by \"neat\" I meant \"cool.\"  Had no idea that was an Americanism.
    :)\r\n\r\nOh, and everybody in SF who might be going clubbing knows where the
    Rickshaw Stop is... the address doesn't even need to be on the flyer. :)\r\n\r\n-m"

    new drum\xB4n\xB4bass project here in Brasil is called Marvada, which is a funny
    way of saying something\xB4s evil. I used blackletter AND bright colors for the
    project identity as well. Hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/chibachiba/2086666693/\r\n\r\nMerry

    to young adults.
