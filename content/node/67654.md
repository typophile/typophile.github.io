body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nWondering if anyone else is having the same problems searching
  the Typohile forums? Every search term I enter comes back with a \"Page Not Found\"
  error. Even the word \"font\" produces this.\r\n\r\nI'd love a quick solution to
  this one, if it exists, because I rely on these forums for info when I encounter
  technical probs, as I'm sure many others do.\r\n\r\nCheers, Wayne\r\nAustralian

    for reindexing or something?

  body: I note that two weeks later, searches that shouldn't come up empty (e.g.,
    "Klimax," "Mondegreen") still do. Are we still waiting reindexing, and if so,
    will we know when it is complete?

    jump out to another browser tab.\r\n\r\nLook for the \"Google Search\" tab on
    the search page at http://typophile.com/search\r\n\r\nOr go direct: http://typophile.com/search/google/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    404 Page not Found errors will now initiate a Google Search, hopefully getting
    you closer to what you were looking for."
