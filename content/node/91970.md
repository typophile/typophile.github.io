body: "Hi, I'm in the middle of creating a digital version of my 40s typewriter font.
  So far I used Bitfonter and have now imported into FontLab. For some reason though
  all the glyphs became much bigger in Fontlab, exceeding the ascender and descender
  heights by far. Anyway, I started to go about manually changing a few whilst mindlessly
  watching TV only to realise that surely there must be a way to change them uniformly??
  Even in BitFonter actually there is a way to resize all selected glyphs in the glyph
  window. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Select all your glyphs in the Font window and go to Tools > Action > Contour
    > Scale. To find the right percentage, first scale a single glyph while the Transformation
    panel is open. (You can also scale multiple glyphs with just the Transformation
    panel, but there's no option to scale the metrics.)

  body: I'd guess that your UPM was different between BitFonter and FontLab (possibly
    2048 in Bitfonter and 1000 in FontLab). In Fontlab, Font Information/Metrics lets
    you change the UPM with or without re-scaling to fit.  Two steps; First, set the
    UPM to its original value (2048) without re-sizing. (You CAN leave it that way,
    in which case an OTF would be non-standard but your glyphs will be exactly as
    you create them). Or go on to the second step, changing the UPM back to 1000 WITH
    re-sizing. You'll then have a standard UPM for OpenType, but your glyphs will
    have small (sometimes imperceptible and sometimes glaring) differences because
    of the different grid size.
