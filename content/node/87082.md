  [[http://typophile.com/node/83817|that]] I'm editing a student newspaper in Scotland
  this year. \r\n\r\nWell anyway, here's my biggest sticky problem: creating definition
  between the sections of the paper. \r\n\r\nTaking notes from Monocle (http://monocle.com/)
  and the New York Subway, I did these to differentiate between our four sections:\r\n\r\n[[http://photos.moniker42.com/photos/i-8d4rq53/0/M/i-8d4rq53-O.png|<img

  like the views one, certainly, and the culture one has a story behind it. Not sure
  about news and sport though... anyone have better ideas? How could I tweak this
  to make them fit more nicely with each other?\r\n\r\n(P.S. the glyphs are Gotham
  Bold, which we use for signposting/page numbers.)"

    sort of star? (Probably need to be at least seven-pointed, to avoid any specific
    cultural associations. \u2733) Which would associate with the idea of a news-flash.
    I certainly think the News one is currently working the least well. For Sport
    it\u2019s logical that you have a green background, so perhaps choose (or draw)
    a ! that has a <em>round</em> dot at the bottom instead of a square one \u2013
    to associate with the balls/pucks etc. inherent in so many sports."
