body: "Hi all,\r\nI've been working on this for a while now and thought it was probably
  at the right stage to show everyone any hopefully get some feeedback. The working
  title is Wolfgang but this will be changed once I think of something better.\r\n\r\nOne
  big thing I'm not sure about is the 'w'. I'm not sure if I should use the overlapping
  one or not. I like it and I think it is a bit different but I have been getting
  mixed feedback about it, some people love it, some think it doesn't quite work.\r\n\r\nThere
  are a few alternate characters I think I might go back to to see if it can be a
  little more consistent. There is a capital 'V' that is the same as one of the V's
  in the crossing 'W' and I may also do a capital A that is like one of these upside
  down.\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nAndy"

    wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso: If a type designer refuses to give a crit simply because he
    doesn't like it, he's either ungraciously selfish, or more an Artist than a Designer.
    Or quite often both.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAlthough this is not my cup of tea, here's
    what I see:\r\n\r\n\"a\": make the top fully round - no flat part.\r\n\"g\": don't
    make the left side of the bottom bowl overshoot the head.\r\n\"w\": no overlap;
    but the McDonalds thing is too much. So try taking the overlapped form and just
    removing the righthand inside arm.\r\n\"x\": needs curves.\r\n\r\nUC: no Art Deco
    low-waist stuff, I don't think.\r\n\"Q\": cool, but too dark at the join.\r\n\"W\":
    same as in the lc.\r\n\r\n\"5\": the head is going too far left.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. Thats one thing I forgot to mention, in most of
    the circles there is currently straight lines, I will make all of these slightly
    curved.\r\n\r\nI also need to go through and fix all the areas that look too dark,
    this is something I haven't addressed yet.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Andy,\r\n\r\nYou didn't say whether your intention was text or display.   The
    overlapped W becomes more problematic at smaller sizes.  It can cause a dark spot,
    particularly with a very low contrast font. For the same reason, it is less obtrusive
    as a cap than it is as lower case. You might think about using it in the cap only.
    \ In headings and display usage, where size can be large, you have more leeway.
    You may make the overlap an alternate so that the typographer can choose by virtue
    of how he/she is using the face.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Thanks Chris,\r\nThe intention was for it to be a display face that could
    work as body copy if it was needed. I.e. be quite readable at 10pt. Though the
    intention was never for it to be used in large amounts of body.\r\n\r\nI have
    tried so many different w's and I don't like any as much as the overlapping one.
    The alternate one in the pdf attached to my first post looks too much like the
    mc donalds arches fliped. I tried what hrant suggested for the 'w' but it looked
    wrong.\r\n\r\nI have made a lot of progress on this since the first post but I
    can't work out how to attach a file to a reply. If anyone knows could they let
    me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy"
