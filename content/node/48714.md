  body: 'By "belong to the same family" do you mean like ITC Garamond, ITC Garamond
    italic,etc. My understanding is that fonts that are generated as a suite will
    come up as styles in a menu unless the naming convention is corrupt. If you simply
    have various individual versions of a font, even if they are of the same "cut"
    or foundry, this will not work unless you use something like FontLab to regenerate
    them as such and that would likely be a license violation. '

  body: "Linotype has the habit of producing same-named fonts in two variants: \"family-linked\"
    and \"single-linked\". The single-linked fonts appear as separate families with
    just one style, while the family-linked fonts appear as multiple styles grouped
    under one family. The confusing thing is that the filenames of the fonts are the
    same so you need to be careful which fonts you actually install. \r\n\r\nI don't
    know if any other vendor is doing this, but still, family grouping conventions
    definitely differ between font vendors. "

  body: Yeah, a lot of the fonts that appear as single fonts, but have the same family
    name are from Linotype and Fontfont.  I think I've got at least 20 versions of
    Meta and Absara.  I was hoping to condense them so I don't have to scroll through
    all of them, but maybe I'll just keep most of them deactivated.  Thanks for the
    help!  Any more advice would be greatly appreciated.

  body: "Slightly off-topic, but along the same line...\r\n\r\nI'm working on an otf
    font family that contains Regular, Demi, Bold, ExtraBold and Black as well as
    their respective italics. Regular Italic, Bold and Bold Italic have their respective
    style flags set and those three plus Regular have their respective style names
    assigned.\r\n\r\nDemi, ExtraBold and Black are grouped into \"mini\" families
    consisting of their regular and italic faces.\r\n\r\nI have no problems with the
    fonts on a Mac. On a PC though, the font selector displays what to my mind is
    bizarre behaviour. (I freely admit that I'm an illegal alient on PCs. I have almost
    no idea of PC customs and practices...and should be deported back to Mac.)\r\n\r\nIn
    Notepad or Word, the font selector displays:\r\nAfont (regular, italic, bold,
    bold italic)\r\nAfont Demi (regular, italic, bold, bold italic)\r\nAfont ExtraBold
    (bold, bold italic)\r\nAfont Black (bold, bold italic)\r\n\r\nI have no idea why
    the font selector displays 4 available styles for Demi, when there are only 2.
    (Selecting regular or bold seems to select the regular Demi face / selecting italic
    or bold italic seems to select the italic face.)\r\n\r\nI expected the ExtraBold
    and Black to link to regular and italic styles... Does the font selector display
    the bold and bold italic styles because Windows actually uses the designated weight,
    rather than the style name?\r\n\r\nHave I missed a setting that links font styles,
    or is style linking all done through the font family/subfamily (style) names?\r\n\r\nI've
    read through FL's manual so many times my eyes are bleeding, but I still have
    probably missed something (it's hard to see through all that red). I've been scratching
    my head for so long and hard that I'm starting to look like, er, nick. If someone
    can point out what I've missed or point me to a manual page number, I'd sure appreciate
    it."

  body: "Later musings...\r\nMaybe I'm expecting the \"wrong\" behaviour from MS apps'
    font selectors.\r\n\r\nI thought if a single face font was installed, only a single
    style would be available in the font selector. Does the MS font selector display
    4 available styles regardless of the number of actual fonts in a family installed...flushing
    out the styles with faux styles?"

  body: "Sandy,\r\nexisting Windows GDI API has a limitation of only supporting up
    to four basic faces (regular, bold, italic, bold italic) per font family in its
    font selection logic. In addition, many applications allow one to apply additional
    algorithmic bold and italic simulation to a native font face. These factors contribute
    to what you are seeeing.\r\n\r\nThis is something we are working on improving.
    For example, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), a relatively new client programming
    platform built on top of .Net Framework, supports virtually unlimited number of
    font weight/width/slope combinations in a single font family, which allows an
    application built on top of WPF to present a single font family instead of four
    different ones in your example. Here is a relevant thread discussing this issue:

  body: "Thank you Mikhail. I'll take a look at it.\r\n\r\nMac type 1 fonts have a
    setting that prevents faux bold and/or faux italic. (It's still in the FontLab
    manual, but for the life of me, I can't find that actual screen.) That's the sort
    of thing I was looking for, so that if you create a font family, Afont Demi for
    instance, you can create regular and italic faces, and only have the regular and
    italic styles available -- not bold or bold italic (since no bold or bold italic
    faces exist).\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSandy"
