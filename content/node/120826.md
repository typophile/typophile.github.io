  with caps in the attached image -- I'm referring to the one line on top, and 2 lines
  of it more or less in the middle? The type is from a mid-18th century Spanish manuscript.\r\n\r\nFor
  a special event, I'm doing a poster that will feature this image, and I would like
  to use a similar font for the headline. I would love to find a font that retains
  some of the fluidity of this handwritten type.\r\n\r\nI'd be most grateful if anyone
  could suggest font(s) that come closest to this historical type.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance!"
