  exporting a png file from Adobe Illustrator (CS5), you got the option \xBBType Optimized
  (Hinting)\xAB. To me type in these pngs looks as crisp as in a pdf file with the
  font embedded. I\u2019m not sure if this was possible in older versions. The only
  difference I see is that in a pdf, you can zoom in. Is there another advantage of
  pdfs? (For posting on typophile)\r\n\r\nAlthough I read the threads about pdfs and
  font piracy, and I think that the people who steal fonts from pdfs would simply
  take it from somewhere else, I would feel better anyway if I don\u2019t have to
  upload a pdf with the (unfinished) font, just to minimize the possibilitys for pirates.\r\n\r\nInstead
  of a pdf, one could upload the same picture as \xBBtype optimized\xAB pngs in different
  sizes. What do you think about that?"

    high quality. If you're making the font in Illustrator, and it's just outlines,
    anyone who wants to steal it will have to go through a lot of work to actually
    steal it\u2014like copy the glyphs into a font editor, space it properly, fill
    in any needed (but missing from specimen) glyphs. Basically, the only people who
    not only want the font, but have the know-how to actually turn it into a font,
    will be the ones who wont just steal it, I think.\r\n\r\nAnyway, a PDF probably
    isn't a big deal. If they reaally want the font, they'll probably ask you about
    it."

    could be in 300dpi, too. \r\n\r\nBut probably you\u2019re right. Most likely the
    ones that are able to steal the font are either professionals and wouldn\u2019t
    do it or they are just bad designers ;-)\r\n\r\nBut aren\u2019t printable pngs
    with the type in different sizes the better way to do it anyway?\r\nThis would
    avoid a illegal copy of the unfinished font, bad or not spaced at all."

  body: "In Illustrator, just convert your text to outlines if you're worried. (I
    think it's cmd+shift+o) Because outlines would be too much work to try and mess
    with.\r\n\r\nPNGs are okay for quick previews, but on Typophile we really prefer
    PDFs for really looking at things. Like I said, converting to outlines should
    be enough protection if you're worried."

- body: "No, i\u2019m not worried, rather looking for an alternative. The problem
    with converting to outlines is that it doesn\u2019t look the same as real type.
    But this has been discussed before and I don\u2019t want to resolve past issues\u2026
    I think I\u2019ll just use a pdf and don\u2019t think about that stuff, I\u2019m
    not sure if anybody is interested in my font at all. :)\r\n\r\nThank you very
    much for your attention!"

  body: Also, note that the "convert to outlines" problem is with InDesign's command,
    not Illustrator's. I have not had problems in Illustrator.

    as well.
