body: Will tall, skinny typefaces and tight kerning become even more popular? Slab
  serif faces seemed to explode out of nowhere and it seems like everyone and their
  little brother jumped on the custom typography bandwagon. What are your predictions
  for the next year?

  body: "Everybody will make very heavy fonts with hairline counters.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    slabs didn't come out of nowhere: they convey\r\nstability and honesty, which
    are valued attributes\r\nsince the recent -and ongoing- financial tomfoolery.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think that \"women\" fonts will overwhelm the market. When I said \"women\",
    I mean on letter shape - sweet, (half) handwritten, with a lot of extra glyphs,
    with a lot OT features, for weddings, curly, tatoo, sketch, girly, with swashes,
    organic (whatever that means), chick, flourish, perfume, party... faces! Also,
    from our angle - 70-80% buyers of our fonts in 2011 were women even we don't have
    an font that fits fully into \"women\" typeface description. Also, plus the trend
    that new foundries follow is to make an easy-to-do (I mean, easier then sans or
    serif families) faces.\r\n\r\n(I hope I didn't sounded like some fashion gay expert)."

  body: "I don\u2019t see a clear trend. But I think that the number of super-families
    will grow even more in 2012 (that may have to do with the fact that it is getting
    harder to do original design)."

  body: Sorta in the middle, I think... more faces than 2011, fewer faces than 2013.
    People will continue to make faces the way they want to make them, including at
    each other.

  body: "I actually hope I'm wrong, but:\r\nWe will see a boatload of fonts that follow
    the \"go wild with\r\nthe styles\" philosophy of deviating the Italic, Bold etc.
    from\r\nthe Roman (as seen in Alda and some of Yanone's work).\r\n\r\nI want to
    be wrong because -although there's some potential\r\nglimmer of merit to this
    admittedly interesting idea- I have\r\nto believe that it's going to be a backfiring
    gimmick almost\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\nThere's a universe of fertile land (already
    being explored)\r\nbetween 100% interpolation versus going full-on 90s again.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
