  I was asked to help someone clean up a monthly newspaper about Wine.\r\nThey are
  currently using Times New Roman for the body text and Futura for titles and so on.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone recommend a serif typeface suited for the body text that would also include
  Romanian diacritics/accents ? As well\r\nas a sans serif typeface that would work
  with it ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nVlad"

  body: "The ideal newspaper text typeface to handle Romanian diacritics would be
    <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text/>Greta</a>, which Peter Bil'ak
    designed specifically to overcome problems with setting heavily diacritical languages
    in newsprint. To go with Greta you could try Bil'ak's <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_sans/>Fedra
    Sans</a>. There are terrific display versions of both Greta and Fedra on Typotheque,
    as well, that you could use to replace Futura.\r\n\r\nBut really, a bit more information
    on the newspaper might be useful. Who is its target audience?, How does it perceive
    itself?, etc."

  body: "Greta does look like a nice font. Be aware that it *looks* like it doesn't
    set as many characters-per-pica  as Times (few fonts do), so if space is an issue,
    you might have to make some compromises. \r\n\r\nAnother consideration is whether
    the newspaper is to be available in PDF format. Some foundries prohibit embeding
    the font in a PDF, some allow it with restrictions, some allow it but require
    a further license. \r\n\r\nFor example, Greta's EULA is livable; they do allow
    embeding the font in a PDF (with a quite reasonable restriction), but it looks
    like an extra license is involved.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
