body: "Greetings Typophiles!\r\n\r\nI'm starting work on my first typeface and I've
  run into a lot of issues and questions concerning how to translate my ideas from
  my sketches to vector. I've been sifting around for information quite a bit to get
  a sense for the process and all the little important details this encompasses...But
  for everything I've read I still don't quite have the experience to get me that
  confidence I need to get going with this project.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nRecently, I've
  read through these forums, countless blog entries and these websites:\r\nhttp://www.typeworkshop.com\r\nhttp://www.typedu.org\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/2009/03/23/the-first-ones-the-hardest/\r\nI
  even asked for this book for Christmas, which is proving to be quite a help concerning
  designing my letter forms and learning about them:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509\r\n\r\nOne
  piece of the puzzle I'm missing after all my research is how to go about translating
  my sketches and ideas into vector format. \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Typophiles, what are
  your guidelines and workflow when it comes to starting a typeface?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>What
  glyphs are the most definitive and will give me my basic curves and shapes for all
  the other letter forms?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I'm kind of a noob at bezier curves. Type
  workshop had some really helpful tips on how to keep the handles of the curves vertical
  or horizontal and to keep it simple..but I can't get the curves I want (Yes, I'm
  talking about you, 'a' and 'C')</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Concerning construction in Illustrator,
  how does everyone go about making their letter forms? Do you use a grid? Right now,
  I am using stroked lines to trace out the shapes. Or is it better to construct them
  out of filled shapes by subtraction and addition with the Pathfinder? This question
  also leads me to....</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Different weights. How am I to achieve different
  weights? What is the logic behind increasing the weight of a typeface? How do I
  know where and when I should adjust curves? And should I keep a spare copy of my
  typeface in stroke-only format so I can increase and decrease the weight as needed
  using stroke weight, then expand it into a solid shape?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nTo
  help you to understand more about what I'm asking, I will enclose some sketches
  of the proposed typeface. Please note that this typeface is still in the conceptual
  stage and I have by no means refined it to anywhere near where I want it to be.
  These are simply sketches and doodles...\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ob3sjL7ja54/TvybomhhTfI/AAAAAAAAA2A/0lWqD9-F0qA/s800/2011-12-29%25252010.57.22.jpg\">Sketch

  call it Canoe Sans because when I started to design it, the shape of the letters
  made me want to write 'canoe' over and over. It is very rounded and casual, but
  the organic curves are proving difficult for me to render digitally. Sorry for the
  wall of questions...any guidance or critique is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMary"

    bezier tools are worthless shit. Design your letters in a font design application.
    Don\u2019t try to build much with strokes unless you draw scripts. Letters don\u2019t
    have even strokes, so why bother designing with them?\r\n\r\n<cite>Different weights.

    doing. You\u2019ll just waste a lot of time populating mistakes over multiple
    fonts. Draw a lot of single weight fonts based on the proportions of existing
    designs in a wide range of styles. Worry about families after you can already
    design a good light font, a good black font, and anything in between."

    how other type designers go about handling this stage of the process so I can
    learn as much as possible. \r\n\r\nmrs. laurenv > I will definitely check out

  body: "Don't look at any other fonts, admired or hated, start working just from
    within what you see as you work.  Avoid How-to books and manuals of all kind.
    \ Learn to see by looking as a child looks when seeing something for the first
    time.  Don't read any books on type design until you finish at least one font.
    \ Spend days discovering what makes an \"n\" different than an \"o\". Create a
    curve that melts perfectly in to a straight line without a hitch or a bump.  Watch
    ice melt and notice the artful way it makes curves.  You have only one chance
    to work totally naively, don't throw that chance away.\r\nDraw hard bezier curve
    lines that feel like spring steel.  Then draw some that look like overcooked pasta.
    \ Figure out why they have these differing appearances."

    Maybe soon (or later) you'll see my typeface up on the critique board. I've got
    a long way to go though...but now I think I have a better direction."
