    perfect. I do suspect they have <strong>several</strong> choice words for it,
    however. \r\n\r\nMy inner geek can't help but point out a screen grab isn't needed
    to measure web spaces. All you need is Firefox and the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/539|cool
    little free utility called MeasureIt.]] Then, it's just a matter of clicking and
    dragging right in the browser window. \r\n\r\nThis is a geek-friendly thread,
    yes? :)"

    a great screen measuring tool (and one of my favorite apps for years now). Mac
    only tho.

    because its the text is too small and has too many words.
