<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, <br> I need to let you know firstly that I'm a chemical engineer with a non-professional interest in typography. <br> <br> Dealing with equations, as I do, I often have need to use superscript (esp. for exponents) and subscript (esp. for indices). <br> <br> For purely subjective reasons I want to use the OpenType "Palatino Linotype" font, rather than the default in Windows ("Times New Roman"). <br> <br> I'm hoping that you're not cursing MS by this stage, because I curse it enough as it is. I need to use MS Word because I need to use a plug-in which (I think) is only compatible with that. <br> <br> Back to the problem. Formatting in any of the other fonts works perfectly. It is exclusively in "Palatino Linotype" that vertical alignments are off (for my purposes). I need the bottom of the subscript to be below the line of the main text, and likewise I need the superscript to rise above the capital letter height (sorry, I don't know the jargon). This happens in every other font, but with "Palatino Linotype" the superscipt and subscript in MS Word are set up to be correct for fractions, so that they neither drop below nor rise above e.g. the letter "X". (The easiest way is to try this out yourself.) <br> <br> I have contacted MS, who indicated that this is due to the fact the "Palatino Linotype" is their 'flagship' OpenType font, packed with all the features - and, of course, MS Word (or Windows?) is not yet compatible with all of them. It seems this requires MS to make a major overhaul of their software, and is not expected in a patch, or even in the next full version (but perhaps the one after!). <br> <br> My questions to you are twofold: <br>(1) Given that I only need the plug-in while I am composing my prose/equations, can any of you recommend a (Word Processing) programme that will correctly handle equation-style superscripts and subscripts in this font? E.g. OpenOffice, Star Office? <br> <br>(2) Can any of you contact MS and/or start a petition to get the OpenType features implemented as soon as possible?! I realise that a lot of you may not regularly use MS products, but I do believe you would be doing a service to typography in general (and to me at the very least) by making these features more widely available to people in the 'real world' (no offence!). <br> <br>Thank-you, <br> DIV</div>

<div class=commentbody>wow, 2 chemical engineers on this board <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0>. I'm also a chemical engineer that left it towards design. <br> <br>On pappers we use LaTeX, isn't that an option for you? Even if you just write the equation on LaTeX and them import the EPS's to your word?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, <br> what a surprise to find another Chemical Engineer. And thanks for the reply. <br> <br>I was thinking about importing equations from either LaTeX or MathML into MS Word, but I don't know whether it's practicable. <br>Currently I write (somewhat) complex equations using 'Equation Editor' within MS Word. Although this is not great, it does get the superscripts and subscripts right. However, when I need to refer to inidividual items in the equations, I prefer to do that in the text, rather than having to open up 'Equation Editor' and create a separarte Object. <br> <br>EXAMPLE <br>Smith and Jones agreed that <br>___ x</div>
