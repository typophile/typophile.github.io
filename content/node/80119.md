  an Irish-themed piece, and am looking for a good font that reads somewhat Celtic
  \u2013 but is still well put together. The only ones I've found are freebies that
  are ugly in their dimensions. Some nice foundry must have done something that at
  least hints at Irish?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Herb is a gorgeous typeface. But it has nothing Irish at all. Whatever the
    ductus is, a minimum amount of specific Irish features might be given, so e.g.
    with A, D, E, R or a, b, d, e, g, r, t.
