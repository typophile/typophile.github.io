body: I'm submitting a proposed design of a Post-Op care manual for knee and hip replacement
  for an area hospital. Just wanted some suggestion on the right fonts to use. I'm
  looking for something with a large x-height; one sans for title, subheads and one
  serif for running text. About 90% of the patients are elderly and for the most part
  the type will not be smaller than 12pt. Some serif designs I've been considering
  are Miller, Elmhurst, Belizio (all from Font Bureau) and Garamond Premier Pro. I'm
  looking at Myriad Pro for sans. What do you think?

    that.

    body: 'I admire Warnock myself, but the real answer to your requirements is ITC
      Stone Serif and Stone Sans. The ITC version offers old style figures if you
      value them as much as I do; otherwise use Adobe''s OpenType version, which uses
      only liner figures but is otherwise very adaptable. Other options: NuSwift and
      Freight Text and Sans from Josh Darden. All have big x-heights and are not too
      delicate for corporate work. The biggest x-height known to man, of course, is
      ITC Leawood, a lot of fun to use but not as punchy as the options above, esp
      Stone.'
