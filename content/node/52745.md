  old sign</a> and let us know if there is a name for the script letters used there.
  I know it probably is not a specific font, but I'm not asking \"what font is this?\"
  Only trying to identify the script lettering style used. \r\nIf anyone knows of
  any fonts that match that style I'll take on the research from there.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    it an upright casual script.

  body: "Ah, thank you Stephen. It reminds me a lot of Monotype's French Script. I
    just checked and that's a good match. I was going to say French Script to begin
    with but was holding out for something more specific. Thanks all the same.\r\n\r\nj

    Avenue</a> or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/coronet-lt/\">Coronet</a>
    (uprighted). Or slightly of the American version of the <a href=\"http://www.typedesign.com/logos/esqu.html\">Esquire</a>
    lettering\r\n\r\nBut along your thoughts of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/upright-script/\">French
    Script</a> more formal perhaps.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and, in particular, the \u2018r\u2019 which connects from the bottom make it look
    very American, to me."
