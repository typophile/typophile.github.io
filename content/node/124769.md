    (http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/HeronSans/) has them also on |E| etc., but in
    the opposite direction than the sample, and it's not as condensed."

  body: "This is very close to many Gothic like Trade Gothic/Alternate Gothic. It
    also gathers influences from DIN mainly with spurless /G and /M centre vertex
    position. Closest I've found are [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chaletcomprime|Chalet
    Comprim\xE9]] (mixing 1980 styles) and [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas|Bebas]]/[[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue|Bebas
    Neue]] (Bebas closest for letters and Neue for digits).\r\nAnd if it's come from
    Nike (what I believe), there are many chances it could could be bespoke."
