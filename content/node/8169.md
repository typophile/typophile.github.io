  &#41; international web sites. Any local bookstore should be able to order the HOW
  Design Books offering. <BR> <BR>A somewhat irreverent look at the business of graphic
  design, the book is based on the author&#39;s mantra of &#34;it&#39;s better to
  be a smart-&#149;&#149;&#149; than a dumb &#149;&#149;&#149;&#34; -  Much of the
  text is from Fisher&#39;s own perspective on the industry after over 25 years as
  a graphic designer. It also contains anecdotes and career lessons from individuals
  like Milton Glaser, Clement Mok, Jack Anderson, Art Chantry, Genevieve Gorder, Nigel
  Holmes, Jennifer Morla, Peleg Top, Ellen Shapiro, Petrula Vrontikis and nearly 100
  other industry professionals.  <BR> <BR>The book includes advice on the building
  blocks of a career, education options, what designers have learned in the &#34;school
  of hard knocks,&#34; how to get more than your foot in the door in your quest for
  clients or a job, and various aspects of dealing with clients on projects. Communication
  issues are covered in some detail, as are establishing a business persona and the
  nitty-gritty issues of business - pricing, contracts and more. Marketing and promotion
  is a major topic in the book. In addition, a number of designers relate major career
  obstacles and how they were overcome - or avoided in the future. There'
