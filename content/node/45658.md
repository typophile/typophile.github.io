  I want to give them a fresher look as they want to slowly get away from an old conservative
  institution. It's a \"business school\" in the sense that preparing kids for the
  real world is their main goal.\r\n\r\nDo you have any font to suggest for a nice
  coupling with Optima Regular  (school's corporate font)? \r\n\r\nthanks"

    always keep it for their logo, but I wouldn''t use it anywhere else. '

  body: 'I hope my post didn''t sound too harsh. Optima, to my eyes, is not a current
    looking typeface. I was a teenager in the 80''s and saw a lot of Optima. I don''t
    know if anyone else feels the same way. I would try and steer them towards something
    more neutral, but still contemporary. There are a lot of typefaces out there that
    could work if they''re open to something else. If they have to stick with it,
    I would look at a sans that works, and keep it to a minimum. Maybe Avenir, Gotham,
    Frutiger? '

  body: "Hello Chris, your post didn't sound harsh at all. \r\nOptima was really popular
    in the late 70 (probably because it was first published then). Thanks for the
    suggestions. I was actually going for Bliss. I'll post some design in a later
    stage so you'll see the results!\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\ntezzu "
