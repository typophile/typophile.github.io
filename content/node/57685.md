  tittle font or something really close.\r\nI found TwyliteZone and it's not quite
  right: http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/2346\r\nSo any suggestions? It might be
  custom made back in the days, but next best thing would be that what is the closest
  to tittle font.\r\nSo maby it can be tweaked a little to make that horrific feeling
  to it. \r\nTanks a lot.\r\n\r\n-ABCDEFG\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TZ_3990.jpg]"

    would probably have been hand-drawn, considering the time period, but if it's
    from something later it could be a font. \r\n\r\nMy thought would be to play around
    with [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Albertus/fonts/|Albertus]] and distort the
    letters, particularly the serifs, until they are close enough.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
