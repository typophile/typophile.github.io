body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is the place for a question like this, but I
  am having a very annoying problem with FontExplorer X Pro. I have reinstalled OS
  X\r\non my MacBook Pro as a clean install, using no time machine. In moving the
  previous fonts back onto my HD, I also brought over the previous\r\n'FontExplorer
  X.fexdb' file so I can still keep my sets from before. From what I have researched,
  my sets should then be restored as 'missing' \r\nand in the 'Conflicts' panel I
  am to locate the files. I have had no such luck.\r\n\r\nThe 'Current Path' of the
  fonts also vary. I have managed resolve a few of them but only family by family
  at best.. and the ones that have a\r\n'Current Path' that differs too much from
  where the files are now located don't work at all. When I click 'Apply' the text
  field goes blank. Also, \r\nmany of the system fonts are 'missing'.\r\n\r\nMy question
  is mainly with the 'Conflict' panel and how to mass resolve conflicts!! Everywhere
  I read, people make it seem easy like all I have\r\nto do is 'replace path component:
  type Users/oldusername/ then in all selected fonts with: type User/newusername/'\r\n\r\nI
  did this and nothing happens. Possibly because some of those fonts are system fonts
  and 1 layer above /Users in /Library?\r\n\r\nI just have no clue.. this is starting
  to feel immensely hopeless and depressing.. please help..\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'FontExplorer builds two files: (1) just the raw database of fonts in a file
    located in Application Support/Linotype (FontExplorer X.fexdb), and (2) user "sets"
    and custom classifications, etc, in a file located in Preferences (com.linotype.FontExplorerX).
    You will need to restore these two files so as to recreate your sets and custom
    classifications, etc. Note, if you at any time do a clean install and locate your
    non-system fonts to any other location, you will need to use a (free) database
    program to edit .fexdb file (sqlitestudio found here: https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt).
    Hope this helps.'
