  Typefaces with over 3000 sizes shown in complete alphabets\"\r\n\r\nIn the book
  its labeled as Standard (Foundry). \r\n\r\nI have found digital version however
  neither seem to match. Can anyone suggest a closer match.\r\n\r\nI have convinced
  the client into using the font, now I have to deliver a digital version of this
  rare sample, so I would greatly appreciate any ideas. It is a beautiful font and
  is definitely markedly different from Helvetica for example.\r\n"
