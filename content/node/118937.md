body: This was used in the titles of sheet music printed by Forster Music Publisher,
  Chicago, in the mid- to late-1920s (on the first page of music, not the front cover).
  It is a little similar to Century Old Style, Bookman (and many others), but the
  distinctive shapes are the lower case h, m, n, c and e, and the upper case T. The
  lower case h and n are my main concern. The letters shown are taken from a few separate
  titles.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhichFont_3965.jpg]

  body: "I have not seen this font except in music industry publications by Music
    Publisher and Edwin H. Morris Company. \r\nThe distinctive bowed strokes on some
    letters and the unusual tilde serifs on them remind me of _Invitation_, by Morris
    Fuller Benton for ATF, created in 1917 or earlier. Invitation has bowed strokes
    on the same letters and usual serifs on them, but these are in the form of a reverse
    wedge rather than a tilde.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InvitationCharmapSM_6460.jpg]\r\nI
    don't know whether the sheet music font appeared before or after Invitation.\r\nI
    have not seen a digital version of either font.\r\nDo you have any more letters
    that you could post, particularly _Q_ and _&_?\r\nDon"

  body: "I have been trawling through PDF's of out-of-copyright sheet music from 1900
    to the early 1920's and have discovered that many of the major sheet music publishers
    in the USA (Leo Feist, Forster, Irving Berlin), Witmark, Jerome H. Remick, Harry
    von Tilzer, Shapiro, etc.) used this font or variations of it in the titles of
    their sheet music. The font (or a close relative) was also used occasionally by
    some European publishers of instrumental music. Later in the 20th century there
    is a fancier version (also with many variations) which has differences in the
    serifs and overall shape of some letters, such as the upper and lower case U being
    shaped like the U in the Korinna font (the top left corner being bowed inwards
    with a tilde serif), and the upper case A having a crossbar at the top like a
    smaller version of an upper case T, different amount of slope on the legs of the
    upper case M, etc. It might actually be a font of a different name which bears
    similarities.  \r\n\r\nIn the sample image I supplied, which was made up from
    screen shots of about three separate pieces of music, I think that I might have
    inadvertently mixed up characters from more than one version of the font. I shall
    have to spend some time working out exactly which one I am looking for. If I can
    manage to sort out the various versions, I will post back.\r\n\r\nThank you for
    taking the time to respond. The Invitation font you showed is quite close to the
    one I have in mind, but not identical. I have a PDF of the 1923 ATF font specimen
    book, so I'll have a look through that. \r\n\r\nSteven."

  body: "Thanks Mike, for mentioning Nick Curtis's Sil Vous Plait NF. We are very
    polite today:)\r\nNick's digitization is an accurate rendition of Invitation.
    Nick's shaded version of SVP is based on the shaded version of Invitation, which
    is also shown in ATF 1923.\r\nDon"

  body: After some research, I've found several metal fonts with similar lowercase
    characteristics during the period from mid-1890 through 1920, but not this exact
    one -- and none of the capitals look like this one. So now I am thinking this
    may have been a proprietary face commissioned by one of the presses during that
    period when there was a ready supply of punchcutters at hand. Probably more than
    a few of them needed the work, too. Even Monotype would do commission work back
    then.
