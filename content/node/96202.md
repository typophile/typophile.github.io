  identified it (book, site, memory &c). That way, you are helping people help themselves

  body: "@hrant: That\u2019s a perfectly valid answer as it lets the asker know that
    you learned it through repeated exposure and memory. Not by asking the internet.
    I know you\u2019re not a fan of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning\">rote
    learning</a> but unless you have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory\">eidetic
    memory</a>, that\u2019s <em>exactly</em> how you learn how to ID typefaces. And
    by you, I mean you, and everyone else (savants aside)."
