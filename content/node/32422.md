body: "I'm working on a game and would like the ability to use different fonts to
  add atmosphere.  The game is setting-independent, so anything that would add to
  the ambiance if used in the right context is good.  Something calligraphic for a
  fantasy adventure setting, something computerish for digital readouts in a modern
  or sci-fi setting, and so forth.  But here's the catch: I don't want the style to
  be too pronounced.\r\n\r\nWhile searching the links on this site I came across the
  \"shamcil\" font, which at first glance seemed good for a fantasy adventure setting.
  \ But after testing it I found a problem:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_4932.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  font can be difficult to read, at least at 12-point.  I need something about halfway
  between this and plain block letters - the style should be just pronounced enough
  to catch the player's eye and make him think \"nice touch,\" but not so much that
  someone used to plain text would have any trouble reading it.\r\n\r\nI need fonts
  that come in 12-point (or very close to it).  And I'm working on a shoestring budget,
  so if a font isn't free for commercial use it needs to be very cheap (no more than
  a dollar or two per usable font).\r\n\r\nSo, any recommendations?  Any help is appreciated."

  body: Yeah, I noticed that all the commercial fonts I saw out there were at least
    5 to 6 dollars minimum (and most far more than that).  I'm not trying to undervalue
    their work, I just really don't have that kind of money and didn't want to waste
    anybody's time by failing to make that clear.  I figured freeware would be all
    I'd actually get.

  body: "I understand.  I am most definitely a newbie when it comes to fonts, and
    it's kind of hard for a newbie to NOT have misconceptions that the more experienced
    will find amusing.  In ANY field.  :)\r\n\r\nI'm more worried about not having
    gotten any recommendations yet, given how fast I got help in the other thread
    I started.  Did I explain what I was after poorly, or are there just not a lot
    of fonts out there that fit the bill?"

    with some of them, though, it turns out that the idea I had for using them is
    simply not practical.  So, no more recommendations are needed.  Thanks anyway,
    everyone."
