body: "Here's a preview of a nearly completed font, !The Black Bloc. My attempt is
  to fuse the distinct look of a gothic script with a more contemporary style. I think
  this font looks far better in flowing text than as individual letters, which is
  nice! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tbb critique sampler_5733.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on line spacing, kerning (looser?) or anything else of note? Any tricks
  to getting it to look better on screen under 13 points?\r\n\r\nMy favorite letters
  are the e, W, x and M, my least favorite are the V, I and the T. Yours?"

  body: "Hi Choz,\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the 'x' is difficult to read, it looks like
    a mirror image of a 'z'. Maybe if you move the connection point of the 'side branches'
    a bit more the center it becomes more of an obvious x.\r\n\r\nAlso, the 'N' is
    confusing with the 'A' and the 'U' and 'V' are close as well. \r\n\r\nI think
    for a decorative fonts like this, it will be a challenge to go for on-screen readability
    at low point size. Did you try to see what happens? \r\n"

  body: "While Typophile was down, I have released the font @ exclamachine.com, though
    I wasn't going to publicize it til tomorrow. I had done <em>exactly</em> as you
    described to the 'x'!\r\n\r\nOriginally I had the 'U' and the 'V' mapped to the
    same glyph; that was even closer. ;) I hadn't noticed the 'N' problem until you
    mentioned it, thats why others' eyes are so good. It doesn't look particularly
    like the 'A', but quite like what someone might expect the 'A' to look like.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as screen readability, I struggle with that with all fonts, but the smooth
    flow of the lowercase helps with that a great deal. And I took more time than
    usual, to try and get it to scale better.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, very
    much. I plan to go back and add text figures soon; I think I will also redraw
    the 'N' if I can get a good image in my mind, before publicizing the font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoz
