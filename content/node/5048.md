  with this:  <BR>I&#39;m looking for this font, I&#39;ve found some similar &#40;stone,
  charlotte, mixage&#41; but really want this one! It&#39;s for a fashion magazine
  -- it needs to be contemporary and a little funky ... readable, lots of different
  weights and work well as titles and body text. I think this fits the bill really
  well. Of course I&#39;ll consider other options ...! <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance
