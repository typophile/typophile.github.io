  and invoice clients, it's saved me a ton of time and it's pretty amazing.\r\n\r\nAlthough,
  I am still unorganized with my expenses, accounting, etc. \r\n\r\nIs there an online
  software similar to Freshbooks that you're happy with?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Hi Dave,\r\n\r\nFreshbooks is a great invoicing software and when we first
    started as a consulting firm, we looked into Freshbooks as well.  We had similar
    issues with Freshbooks and decided to make an online accounting software to track
    income and expenses. \r\n\r\nYou can view a free live demo of Clarity Accounting
    -- our online accounting software, please go to:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.clarityaccounting.com/demo\r\n\r\nThe
    service only costs $10 / month to use and we provide a free trial and excel export
    in case you want to leave with all your data.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear some
    feedback from you after you've viewed the demo :)\r\n\r\nWe are considering the
    possibily of integrating with Freshbooks using their API. Do you think that would
    be a good idea?\r\n"

  body: I have a google spreadsheet for that. No bells and whistles, but works fine
    for simple expense tracking for me.

  body: A few months ago, I seriously explored the many options out there, including
    Freshbooks and other, less sophisticated products like [[http://www.blinksale.com/
    | Blinksale]]. But none met my requirements, which include being able to invoice
    in multiple currencies (namely CAD and USD, for me). Ultimately, I've found that
    none of these systems is up to snuff so I went old school and hired a bookkeeper.
    Oh, and I use [[http://www.billings2.com/ | Billings]] (which, like Freshbooks,
    is a Canadian product) for basic invoicing; it's likable enough.
