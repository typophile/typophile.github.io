body: "I am looking for reversed out versions of Helvetica and Garamond to mix with
  black on type in a document (long story short the client wants an interim document
  between two editions that indicates the areas that have changed and it must be possible
  to photcopy on a monotone copier). Failing Helvetica and Garamond any sans and serif
  could do. I know Linotype used to do a version of Helvetica and Univers Bold Reverse,
  ideally I would need a family though.\r\nThanks in advance with fingers crossed,\r\nTim"

    out how to that as a character style. However it would have been far simpler to
    use a font like Helvetica Bold Reversed, which was apparently only available for
    Linotron 202 according to the 1988 LinoType Collection.\r\nTim"

    just isn't an industry demand for them.\r\n\r\nThe only old technology work-around

    about every DTP app can display an outlined version of the font.\r\n\r\nI'm glad
