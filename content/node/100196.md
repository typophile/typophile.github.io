  to put my very first typeface here. \r\n\r\nI've started with type design and this
  typeface on Summer workshop Tipobrda 2012 in Slovenia. It went through many changes
  and ideas, many times thrown in trash, many times totaly redesigned.  I would like
  to stop at some point and do the rest of the design process. Still I'm not sure
  about this stage it and that's why I'm posting it here. \r\n\r\nHere is simple latin
  alphabet. Texts, diacritics and greek are in attachments. Also I put there one older
  stage of design. \r\n\r\nI'll be very gratefull for any comments and especialy critique.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnje

  body: Admirable! Something bothers me about the extrabold w, though. I don't object
    to the basic structure; I think it's that the second stroke seems to have a mismatched
    slope. Capital W doesn't have this problem, but the way the top of the middle
    stroke flares from (or tapers toward) the join may be conspicuous.

  body: It's nice. I think the caps may be too condensed, and you need to make a decision
    about the height of crossbars. I'd go for optically centred in E, F and H, and
    (maybe) just slightly higher in P and R.

  body: I think the crossbars work with this and help keep it from being redundant.
    I might just slightly lower the crossbar of E, and I mean very slightly.

  body: "Thank you for your finds. I can see the trouble with /w now. The thing with
    proportions bothers me from beginning. On the first sketches they were even more
    narrow. But then I was unable to match the lowercase with them. I'll try make
    uppercase bit wider. Is there any common connection between capitals and lowercase
    in terms of proportions? \r\n\r\nThanks Jan"

  body: I agree with Dave, I think a firm and clear decision needs to be made whether
    the crossbars are to be "normal" or "eccentric." Right now hairline /E/F/H/ look
    much more stylized than hairline /A/, and also more than any of the corresponding
    extrabold letters.

  body: "I've bee thinking whole afternoon about the crossbar thing and came up wih
    two solutions. At first I tried to apply more eccentric style to every crossbar,
    but there I was tightend with xtrabold cut, so it hasn't moved so much further.
    Then I made visually centered one. In comparision the eccentric one is more distractious
    then the normal one. What do you think is better?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://jancharvat.cz/projects/type

    design/own/anje/data/crossbartest2.jpg]]\r\n\r\nIn the begining there was some
    idea of making a font it with few differences. After nearly half a year they all
    dissappeared. Now looking backward I can see they were probably in most cases
    inappropriate. But I'm bit worried it's falling to ordinary, booring box of fonts...\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your time.\r\nJan"

  body: "The \"eccentric\" heights are more interesting.\r\n\r\nI still feel like
    in the extrabold only the /F/ and /H/ read as correspondingly eccentric. Can you
    lower /A/ and raise /E/ more? It may also help to lengthen the middle arm of /E/
    (and /F/) in that heavier weight."

  body: "eliason: You're right, definitely more interesting. When it isn't in comparision,
    I think  it's not distracting at all. I tried also to add more contrast to bold
