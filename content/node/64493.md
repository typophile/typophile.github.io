    and services that has been online for months or even years. History articles are
    often retreads about ornaments, Swiss modernists, and totalitarian propaganda.
    I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were in the $5\u2013$10 range, but why would I spend
    $30 on a redundant magazine when for $35 I can get a good book about something
    new?\r\n\r\n<em>Eye</em> no. 68, Beyond the Canon, was the last interesting design
    magazine I saw. Someone needs to just make that concept a quarterly. I don\u2019t
    ever want to read another magazine article about Helvetica, Wim Crouwel, Paul
    Rand, Stefan Sagmeister, or see another poster of a dictator."

  body: "1. Better content. Almost anything recent that ends up in a design magazine
    was probably seen online about 10,000,000 times in the last year. So if it goes
    to print, make it worthwhile. The writings of Alice Twemlow, Paul Shaw, and Rick
    Poynor are all examples of how to write the last work about a topic that\u2019s
    already been covered elsewhere. And Eye No. 67 is a paragon for people who want
    to get off the beaten path. Give us more articles about postwar design history
    that doesn\u2019t involve modernism. Minneapolis had designers before Prince needed
    album covers. Show me!\r\n\r\n2. If you want to practice book arts, go make books
    and not magazines. Stop using high-end paper that makes the magazines too expensive
    and too small. I don\u2019t care if you have to print on coated TP, just accomplish
    my next point\u2026\r\n\r\n3. Make design magazines ENORMOUS and get rid of all
    that white space. I am not buying another design magazine that discusses a designer\u2019s
    use of type and shows her work at such tiny sizes that the type is barely legible
    without a magnifying glass. This problem is not new, people have been complaining
    about it a lot longer than I\u2019ve been in design. The layouts in <em>Communication
    Arts</em> are one of the worst offenders. <em>Comm Arts</em> needs to be killed,
    dismembered, and brought back as a crazed Frankenstein\u2019s monster based <em>Coilhouse</em>,
    <em>Idea</em> and <em>V</em>. To accomplish this we must also\u2026\r\n\r\n4.
    Stop putting so much stuff into features and annuals! Everybody has already seen
    it and images will probably be archived online until we\u2019re all dust. Putting
    less stuff in design magazines and making it bigger means that there\u2019s actually
    some value to the images that do get run."

    I have advertised in Eye and Creative Review in the past, and although it is hard

    Is it because I advertised in these UK magazines? I really can't say.\r\n\r\nI
