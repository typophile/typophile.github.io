  with a Times New Roman typeface.  I really like it and I don't want to modify it.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if I would run into any copyright infringement if I leave it as is?\r\n\r\nHere
  is a pic attached.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5565.png]"

  body: If your question is whether you can use Times New Roman for your logo, there
    should be no problem; the thing to check is the End-User License Agreement ([[EULA]]),
    but there may not be a clear one if this is the version bundled with an operating
    system. Regardless, it is a valid use of a font to use it in a logo--otherwise,
    purchasing a font wouldn't be very worthwhile. There are sometimes limitations
    (e.g. you may not embed the font in a PDF, you may not use it in a video game
    without prior permission, etc.). If your question is about something else, such
    as the name or appearance, that I don't know.

  body: "Yes, but the EULA issue isn't going to affect you, if what you're doing is
    using it to create a logo, then delivering the logo as vector art (or other image
    file.) \r\n\r\nAssuming you have the rights to use the font, then you can use
    it to create a logo/wordmark. then you can distribute the wordmark as an image
    file with no licensing issues.\r\n\r\nThe issue would only come into play if you're
    going to do some sort of template design or similar, where you supply a use of
    the typeface, then each user would have to have the font licensed for themselves.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    you can use the font to create an image, then alter that image in any way you
    like. Say, you type out \"MiMo\" in TNR, then convert to vector shapes, then delete
    some of the serifs, and distribute the image file. That is a fine use of the type.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you can't do is open TNR in Fontlab, delete some serifs, save as a font called
    Times for MiMo, and distribute the font (unless the EULA allows that.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJason

  body: "Ahhh, that explains a lot!\r\n\r\nYes, I only want it for my logo as you
    see it on the image, nothing else.\r\nAnd since I have no symbol / graphic / drawing
    etc. as a \"logo\" but\r\nonly the name written with Times New Roman,  I was wondering
    if this is illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your time, AuricFuzz and Jason,
    I really appreciate it."
