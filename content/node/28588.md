body: "I've just got to Reading. Does anyone have advice/warnings/anecdotes? \r\n\r\nI'm
  in Halls, and it's Freshers' Week, a ludicrously repetitive series of group pleasures
  meant to ensure the mental comfort of the newest students. The psychological incompetence,
  the crudity of imagination, that must inform this program's design are still more
  frightening than its results. No means of rational intercourse is permitted the
  children bussed and goaded into Fez, or to the Union, whose wailing is obscured
  by recorded music and whose inexpensive drinks are salted with tears. Often two
  of the taller lads, perhaps bemused by love, begin to fight; a shorter friend, preferring,
  as he must, civility to strength, \"breaks them up\"; but - watch out! - one of
  the young pugilists in retreating knocks an unobserved fat girl, or a lurching mathematician:
  her purple-flavoured ale is spilt, his dead-pan seduction curtailed. What must ugly
  or intelligent undergraduates make of it? Presumably the poor things they just blame
  themselves for not loving it, or getting laid, as much as they assume they ought.
  \r\n\r\nSelfishly I'm alright, since the School of Typography is of course a miracle
  of scholarship and moral grandeur. There must also be lots of civilized postgrads
  in all subjects: any tips on how to find them?"

    early on as you can. My only regret during my time at Reading was not taking the
    list seriously until I was revising for the 3rd yr exams (this was back when it
    was a four year course). '

    halls &mdash; quickly! Everyone's been telling me we only have a short while before
    all our free times disappears altogether.

    at least 10 fun guys and beautiful girls. They run in packs and like to go dancing.\r\n\r\nThe
    guys might have a kick about during the day occassionally and some might have
    brought their cars all the way from Greece.\r\n\r\nGet yourself a push bike.\r\n\r\nStay
    away from the pub row downtown and try not to end up in the Purple Turtle. \r\n\r\nAvoid
    9am classes and get the important books fast since most will be not available
    in the library. \r\n\r\n"

    Arab girls who I've got cooking for me. One tells me that I am her brother's spiritual
    double, and therefore the proper sounding-board for her enthusiastic ideas about
    suicide.
