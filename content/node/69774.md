body: "Hello guys\r\nMaking a brochure where some pages are black set on white paper
  and some are reversed. Typography is the same but on the reversed pages looks visually
  different. Someone long time ago told me that with reversed type leading and tracking
  need to be increased to keep it visually balanced with the regular pages. Can someone
  please elaborate?\r\nthanks"

  body: Well, for one, usually you'll use a slightly bolder weight for reversed text.
