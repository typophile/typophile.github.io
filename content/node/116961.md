  2012 \r\nhttp://tdc.org/competitionwriteup/tdc-typeface-design-winners-2012/\r\nhttps://www.behance.net/gallery/2657771/YARD-RISK-AND-BUSINESS\r\n\r\nA
  few days ago, I stumbled upon the rip off version of my font by the studio Anagrama\r\nhttp://www.anagrama.com/portafolio/167-naci%C3%B3n\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on how to react to this and what I can realistically do would be much appreciated.\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\nH."

  body: "You call it a \"rip off version\". By that I would interpret it to mean they
    copied the design and are calling it by another name. Is that the case?\r\n\r\nOr
    is it a case where they are using an unlicensed copy of your font?\r\n\r\nWhat
    you do, or can do, is dependent upon the situation. More information is needed."

  body: "To begin with, here is what the typeface Chiavari looks like:\r\n\r\n[[http://helenezund.ch/chiavari.html]]\r\n\r\nAnagrama
    is in Mexico. It is a design and branding company, and Naci\xF3n, rather than
    being the name of a typeface, is the name of a housing project for which they're
    providing a brand identity.\r\n\r\nSo they might be <em>customers</em> rather
    than unfair competitors to the designer of Chiavari, and only garbled web links
    to this use of the typeface made it seem like that company was in the typeface
    design business... sort of."

  body: "Thanks for your post,\r\n\r\nI never commercialized the font and never gave
    the file away, except to a few type designer friends. I think they created a custom
    typeface for their client, veeeery much inspired by my design. Some letters like
    uppercase U and V are different but others are clearly identical\r\nIn red, their
    work, in green, mine. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot

  body: It sounds very much like one of your friends is not quite ethical. I think
    your best course of action would be to contact Anagrama and provide them with
    complete documentation that it is your original work being sold to them. If they
    are like most reputable firms they will quickly back off from using it if that
    is what you want. They may also provide you with more information as to how they
    came to use it which might be of help to you.

  body: "<cite>It sounds very much like one of your friends is not quite ethical.</cite>\r\n\r\nSince
    the font used by Anagrama closely resembles, but is not identical to, Chiavari,
    and Chiavari won an award, so its general appearance had received publicity, that
    conclusion does not seem to be warranted, because there is no reason to assume
    they got hold of an actual Chiavari font, and no need for them to access privileged
    information to know what Chiavari looks like."

  body: "Yes, it's too close. And the extent to which it's being used means it most
    probably is an actual font (although not necessarily one their client has been
    given a copy of). First thing to do is write a firm but gracious letter asking
    for an explanation, and outlining your expectations. In terms of expectations,
    I would set a price for Chiavari and put forth that either purchasing it or switching
    fonts would be acceptable (noting however that your lack of publication does count
    against you here).\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n1: How come you won in 2012 while the font was
    from 2009?\r\n2: They could have also seen it here: http://typophile.com/node/90125\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
