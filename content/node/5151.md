  body: As I recall from Arnold Bank, my old calligraphy teacher, the ct and st ligs
    were originally done in calligraphy.  I think by dragging the corner of the flat
    pen or using low pressure on the pointed pen &#40;and Wacom thought they started
    pressure sensitive drawing:-&#41;  Look at Blackletter writing as well as cursive.  Those
    old guys were really good at it.

  body: I don&#39;t remember the stroke order or even if this was done the same by
    most writers.  It was more on the order of a flourish and sometimes a way to make
    up for a spacing dilema.  An example is the end-of-line &#34;e&#34; which had
    a long extension below the crossbar.  Remember, letter and word spacing was done
    by eye and on the fly; sometimes the end of a line came unexpectedly so little
    tricks and alternate letterforms came about to save the day.  Later these variants
    became normal and sometimes could be used to distinguish individual hands.

    <BR>The Mercator ligation seems a bit mannered, no? It makes me think that, yes,
    the original motivation was chirographic facilitation, but then formal sensibilities
    kicked in. This, even though you&#39;re right in alluding to the fact that slanted/cursive
    writing is faster/less_formal. But the Psalter sample is much more sobre, and
    it still have ligation, albeit logically more reserved instances. <BR> <BR>&#62;

    never noticed happen.</i> <BR>Yes you definitely would. The examples that she
    shows are consistent with this. Her style also doesn&#39;t ligate except in tt,
    ra &#40;which looks cool&#41; and the ear on the g lending itself as the dot on
    i in a gi combination. <BR> <BR>The Mercator ligation does seem mannered especially
    in the word est and in the ct, though I think in the st ligation using the long
    s makes it look more natural. <BR> <BR>I think that the thin joins in Digital
    Fournier are definitely distracting. I asked my lady to read a page of the text
    and tell me what she thought, and she said those connectors on the s and t make
    me crazy. So in my informal survey, we&#39;re not the only ones. <BR> <BR>I have
    to say that ct and st ligatures can sure look cool. I like the idea of them. I
    think that the space between the letters having an arcing top could be nice like
    in the psalter example. I&#39;d definitely consider including these ligatures
    in an italic companion to a text face. <BR> <BR>Personally, I think that ff fi
    tt <i>are</i> more important. <BR> <BR>As for the &#39;discretionary&#39; descriptor,
    the employement of any ligatures would seem to be at the discretion of the typesetter,
    as their design is at the discretion of the type designer. Not really wrong but...
    <BR> <BR>It may be more useful to make a distinction about how <b>critical</b>
    a ligature is. In this regard I would say that fi is more critical than ct, as
    fi affords greater opportunity for letter shape collision and murkyness than st.
    Also since the st <i>is </i> a chirographic descendant, I would argue that it&#39;s
    existence is less critical and more appropriate to italic forms &#40;though not
    exclusively&#41;. I think I would enjoy seeing a text face where the ct and st
    looping isn&#39;t as sculptered as in Digital Fournier, but more integrated as
    in the psalter example. And I could imagine that it could look very attractive...

  body: '&#62;If a &#39;t&#39; follows, you are now in a good position to loop upwards
    to the top of the stroke. <BR> <BR>Sorry Victor, the writer is in a difficult
    position. <BR>To make the typical ct or st join according to the technique you
    describe, one has to push upwards &#40;bottom right to top left&#41; from the
    end of the c or s, digging the pen into the paper. <BR> <BR>However, it IS possible
    to do such a &#34;backwards&#34; stroke, keeping the pen barely touching the paper,
    and the stroke brief.  <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s a skill worth mastering, because
    the alternative is to bring one&#39;s pen back to the same spot three times, and
    each time to halt and raise/drop the pen: once at the end of the final &#34;c&#34;
    stroke, once at the beginning of the &#34;t &#34; diagobal upstroke &#40;see Camp,
    in above JW post&#41;, and once again for the beginning of the &#34;t&#34; crossbar.
    This does not feel like good, flowing calligraphy, and I think this is one reason
    why calligraphy has developed the &#34;ct&#34; and &#34;st&#34; ligatures, to
    avoid this constricted series of motions. <BR> <BR>Another chirographic reason:
    from an aesthetic point of view, the combinations ct and st are unsatisfying,
    because the horizontal strokes at the top of the &#34;x height&#34; are close,
    and yet one cannot render them as one horizontal joining stroke &#40;as in ti
    and fi&#41;, because that  would mess up the c/s &#40;for the same reason that
    one does not top-join ci and si as ligatures&#41;. So, finishing the c/s with
    a flourished ligature provides a sense that the character has been concluded purposefully.
    <BR> <BR>Why did the ct and st ligatures persist in type when so many others were
    dropped? <BR> <BR>Because the humanist t with its very short ascender is a weak
    glyph. It looks quite similar to r and c in old-style faces from Bembo to Caslon.
    The ct and st ligatures add distinction, in more ways than one. <BR> <BR> <BR>

    that in the Renaissance reed pens were in more widespread use in Europe than they
    were in later times, when they were almost wholly supplanted by steel nibs. As
    any Arabic calligrapher can ably demonstrate, a reed pen can be pushed without
    &#39;digging into the paper&#39;. In addition to widespread use of reed pens,
    contemporary instructions for the cutting of quills stress suppleness as a desirable

  body: '&#62;&#39;digging into the paper&#39;. <BR> <BR>John, digging in to the paper
    is the worst case scenario. <BR>A more likely event is having one&#39;s nib &#34;catch&#34;
    on a piece of fibre. <BR> <BR>A supple pen &#40;especially with a fine point&#41;
    can be a disadvantage when doing a push stroke, because it will start to bend
    and catch at the slightest resistance, whereas a stiffer &#40;and/or broader&#41;
    nib will push through, or ride over, resisting fibres and hold its angle. <BR>
    <BR>But suppleness is not a simple issue. <BR> <BR>The structure of a nib, whether
    in a reed, quill, or metal, is designed to be supple when pushed down, yet stiff
    in other directions -- not only does this allow the user to regulate ink flow
    by the amount of downward pressure, it also keeps the nib firm when moved sideways
    or pushed, when stiffness is required to prevent the nib from catching. <BR> <BR>The
    relationship between the hardness of the nib material and the smoothness/hardness
    of the paper/vellum is also an issue. <BR> <BR>Whatever the pen, going against
    the grain is counter-intuitive to the way one has learned to write calligraphy,
    and the way the vast majority of characters are formed. <BR> <BR>However, strokes
    that are difficult for a nibbed instrument are no problem for a pencil or crayon,
    and calligraphers develop their embellishments -- complex flourishes -- as extemporized
    single strokes. So there is definitely a reason to incorporate the more difficult
    strokes into one&#39;s style.  <BR> <BR>Interestingly, a determining factor as
    to whether one executes a difficult ligature in a single move involving pushes,
    or splits it to avoid them, is how much ink is left in one&#39;s pen, and how
    smoothly it&#39;s flowing. If one has recently dipped, it&#39;s easier to do push
    strokes.'

    of frequent sequences of letters -much more than just two- were cast as individual
    sorts, to save time while composing. The Times newspaper was set in such a scheme
    in the beginning, but then the printers union -realizing the savings in time,
    hence reduction in their incomes- decided to charge by the letter and not the
    sort, so the efficiency of the system became moot. And then mechanical composition
    came around, so it didn&#39;t matter. <BR> <BR>And here&#39;s the layout from

    union -realizing the savings in time, hence reduction in their incomes- decided
    to charge by the letter and not the sort, so the efficiency of the system became

    system became a hoot.&#41; <BR> <BR>Boy good thing that did not catch on, Linotypes,
    Monotypes and &#34;Computers&#34; would have been sold for &#34;doorstops&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>I would challenge you over this so-called-union-problem. What is your
    source? The &#34;Wizard of Ozz?&#34; Not that I disbelieve you. Just that I would
    like to understand the nature of the objection myself. Unlike yourself I have
    &#34;a more than considerable hot metal understanding&#39;. I have &#34;a working
    mans perspective&#34;. In other words this system is crapolla. <BR> <BR>There
    were many inventions and logotype schemes. Setting ligatures, &#40;logotype&#41;
    in hot metal &#34;does not save time&#34;. If they did the non union shops would
    have welcomed them, yes? <BR> <BR>The more ligatures, the more memory, the more
    travel of the hands, arms or body. Remember, Chinese often set type using roller
    skates. <a href="http://lanstontype.com/ChineseWindow.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/ChineseWindow.html</a>  Maybe
    the British Unions did not think &#34;roller skating was part of their job description&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>The California Job Case has spaces for ligatures, &#40;logotypes&#41;.
    Believe me, they were not located in the major traffic zones. They were kept &#34;out
    in the back forty&#34;. The boxes were so tiny it was hard getting your fingers
    into them, often the &#34;labour hoot saving logotype ligatures&#34; would jam
    themselves tight against the sides. <BR> <BR>Memory failure is certainly a consideration,
    if one did not realize at first they were setting a ligature, &#40;logotype&#41;
    they would have to think, stop, distribute the characters and then go for that
    obscure box containing <i>&#34;time and labour saving logotype, if only they had
    known they needed one, remember where it was, and had not loaned their roller
    skates to the baby sitter&#34;.</i> <BR> <BR>So don&#39;t go all &#34;romantic,
    poetic and nostalgic on me about hot metal&#34;. I can&#39;t stand to see a grown
    digital junky weep.  <BR> <BR>Get the picture. <BR> <BR>Tell me how many ems per
    hour was set with that silly scheme you have dug up. I can&#39;t wait for you
    to remember all those combinations and where they go. The hoot word breaks would
    be interesting to watch. Want to make a wager, how about a &#34;race&#34;? <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, that said, I am glad your are interested in this sort of thing. If
    I ever get to my material I would welcome a more elaborate discussion on the many
    different inventions. Don&#39;t take this as a criticism, it is a backhanded compliment.

    It&#39;s 100% anti-ductus. <BR> <BR>Hmm, do you have a good sample of Legato,
    Hrant? <BR>I&#39;m looking at it through FF&#39;s website, and honestly, I don&#39;t
    understand your enthusiasm. <BR>I mean, of course it looks great but... &#39;most
    significant font ever&#39;??'

  body: 'The difference between legibility and readability &#40;of fonts&#41; is central
    in the same way that the difference between deliberation and immersion is. The
    two have different rules, with legibility generally being much easier to satisfy:
    like a left-handed calligrapher&#42; will be able to decipher any single glyph
    just as easily as a right-handed person, and so would a person with no hands at
    all! This isn&#39;t to say that handedness is irrelevant to the discussion - in
    fact I think it helps show the limits of chirography, since handedness determines
    whether the traditional angle of the pen is &#34;natural&#34; or not. Very telling
    to me is that Gerrit Noordzij says that maintaing &#34;proper&#34; ductus is so
    important that it&#39;s better for a left-hander to write <i>vertically</i>, in
    effect rotating the forms 90 degrees - nevermind that people read <i>ballpoint</i>
    writing just fine. BTW, every time I say this there&#39;s a torrent of apolgetics
    and attacks, claiming that I don&#39;t really understand what Noordzij is saying.
    Bull. The bottom line is that he&#39;s asking left-handers to write in a way that
    they can&#39;t read their own writing! At least not without the <i>unnatural</i>
    need to flip your neck or your paper. And why? To maintain the Holy Ductus. Gimme
    a break. <BR> <BR>&#42; Of which there are very few - understandably - if sadly,
    because left-handers have unique properties. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s funny, left-handers
    are a small enough minority that they get abused, but they&#39;re not small enough
    a minority that they&#39;re invisible. How inconventient to chirographic theory...

  body: This is enlightening; please don&#39;t think I&#39;m arguing, I, personally,
    am just curious and eager to discuss the matter.
