  books (I get frustrated with \"traditional\" text books sometimes, for a variety
  of reasons). The class I'm wondering about specifically is called Print Based Media.
  The course description: <em>Principles and processes of visual communication in
  digital print; may include typography, image/text relationships, layout design and
  book arts.</em>\r\n\r\nI've only taught it one time before, but didn't require a
  book. Since it's a pretty basic class the projects stay pretty basic\u2014event
  posters, redesign book covers, one color, etc. I think the students would benefit
  from having a book to reference, especially since they generally haven't had much
  conscious exposure to design yet. Last time I taught it they were screaming for
  Photoshop tricks and computer gizmos, so a book that has some historical leanings
  might be nice.\r\n\r\nI probably haven't been very clear, so I apologize. Any input
  is appreciated."

    wish list.\r\n\r\nFor this particular class though, I need to stay less type focused
    (so why am I posting on typophile if I'm looking for general design books? Because
    there are a lot of smart people here, that's why). Amazingly, this school has
    exactly zero typography classes, so the students are not up to speed in that area.
    And a few other areas as well, but that's another issue. I just need them to go
    from the basic basics (form, line, etc, etc) to the mid-basics, like compositional
    basics.\r\n\r\nAs a side track, you wouldn't believe how many students are just
    not interested in anything off-screen. \"Can we use Photoshop for this?\" \"When
    can we learn Dreamweaver?\" Depressing.\r\n\r\nGood night."

    take a print-based course. It is impossible to design for print without understanding
    paper and ink, things like traps and dot gain ... etc.

    should know something about it, but I fear a massive mutiny if I make these people
    \"bored.\" I don't want to bore you with a list of my complaints and problems
    (kids these days!), so I'll just say that <a href=\"http://www.tricity.wsu.edu/dtc/\">the
    program itself</a> is not a regular graphic design program. Most of the projects
    will undoubtedly be output on the laser printers available at the school or on
    home printers. It's not bad to learn how to make something turn out good on a
    cheap ink jet printer, but some higher end or out of the ordinary stuff would
    be good as well. Lead type is definitely out. Boo-hoo.\r\n\r\nAnyway, any suggestions---no
    matter how technical or off-beat---are welcome and appreciated."

    biggest impression on me was Jan White's Graphic Idea Notebook.  It's just so
    weird and cool and inspiring, while at the same time reviewing the nuts and bolts
    of graphic communication (mostly in the context of pre-Photoshop magazine art
    direction).   To be fair, the version I read was the 1980 edition and not the
    more recent 2004 edition.  I'd love to take a look at that... although I prefer
    the older cover (the bigger img).\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1-58115-354-6-2T_5116.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1600_1_4112.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "Well, if you aren't going to bore them, where are you going to find your
    fun? :)\r\n\r\nA couple printing technology things that worked for me were: tearing
    apart an old hard cover book ($1 at a flea market) to see how it work, especially
    how the pages were imposed.\r\n \r\nGetting a piece of newspaper (this might cost
    more than the book) and having everyone tear out an ad or article. Great teaching
    moment on paper grain, and why you can tear easily one way, and not the other.
    Follow up with folding a piece of bond paper with and against the grain to see
    the difference. Finally, show the wrapper from the ream of bond (hopefully it
    will show the grain direction with an underline).\r\n\r\nLess exciting stuff involved
    looking at colored halftones with a loupe to see the angles of the halftone screens.
    Looking at black and white halftones to find the shape of the dots and the angle.\r\n\r\nMy
    students hated my course while they were taking it, but tended to rave over it
    when they got a job and found out that this boring stuff was important, and they
    moved ahead quicker than the students from other schools who didn't know it."

  body: "Isaac, \r\n\r\nWill you be teaching your students the difference between
    RGB colors and CMYK colors? I'm not kidding -- it seems that lots of practitioners
    don't know something as basic as that these days...\r\n\r\nAt the risk of boring
    your students <strong>even more</strong>, when I went to design school in the
    80s one of the first books we had to read for design class was <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=7264\"><em>A
    Primer of Visual Literacy</em></a>, by Donis A. Dondis. It covers the basic elements
    of visual communication (dot, line, shape, direction, tone, color, texture, scale,
    dimension, movement), the dynamics of contrast, visual techniques (i.e., balance-instability,
    symmetry-asymmetry, regularity-irregularity, neutrality-accent, etc.), and so
    on. I think that 99% percent of my class complained about how boring it was, but
    one of my friends later admitted that he'd learned quite a bit by reading it.
    This book is mostly text with a few simple diagrams, but there are two alternative
    titles that have more graphics (and have more recent publication dates): <a href=\"http://www.papress.com/bookpage.tpl?cart=110&isbn=1568985819\"><em>Visual
    Grammar</em></a>, by Christian Leborg, and <a href=\"http://www.viget.com/inspire/graphic-design-the-new-basics/\"><em>Graphic
    Design: The New Basics</em></a>, by Ellen Lupton and Jennifer Cole Phillips.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Eeblet mentions Jan White! I borrowed some of his books from the library when
    I was just out of school; he has a few (one of them was called <em>Editing By
    Design</em>... it was for newspaper editors, but had a great chapter on design
    and layout). I think they are great for beginners -- they aren't densely packed
    with text or theory. Just what your action-seeking students might be into.  :-)\r\n\r\n[EDIT]
    And wait a minute, beyond books, is there any way you can make a field trip to
    a local print or letterpress shop? How about a local magazine or newspaper? Those
    things are usually eye-opening experiences when you are still in school."

    as much typography material as I can since they haven't had any. The other thing
    I try to work in is chapter four from the Dondis book. Such great stuff, and it
    is dry and difficult to read, but great anyway (I love Univers generally, but
    the use of it in PoVL is not that great. It's very fatiguing).\r\n\r\nSome of
    the books I've been looking at from Amazon are poster collections (handmade and
    otherwise), books about how to use grids, and album cover design collections.
    I finally realized that I was looking for books to inspire rather than instruct,
    like eeblet mentioned. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/flatnessisgod-Ryan-McGinness/dp/1887128344/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid=I2MKO87R3L1KLP&colid=1PX0QJ3CQTQI9\">
    Flatnessisgod</a> by Ryan McGinness did that for me a few years ago, but unfortunately

    start at 6PM.\r\n\r\nOff topic: Ricardo, are you a Boca fan? My son is nuts about
    the team. He wears his official Boca Juniors socks any time he gets a chance,
    and is constantly kicking a ball around the yard pretending to score goals against
    River. Everything has to be blue and yellow."

    question, Isaac! No, I'm not, but my father was. I have a funny story about this.
    We moved to the States when I was 3 years old, then moved back to Buenos Aires
    when I was in third grade. I had no idea my dad was a Boca fan. So on my first
    day of class in Buenos Aires all these kids ask me what soccer team I am a fan
    of, and I don't know any teams. A bunch of them, obvious River fans, start shouting
    \"River! River!\" Next thing you know, I am at home having dinner with my folks
    and I tell them how I've become a fan of River. My dad's jaw drops, and after
    a beat he says, \"But I'm a Boca fan!\" Poor dad... I'm sure that was harder for
    him than when I told him I wanted to study graphic design.  :-D\r\n\r\nSo anyway,
    for a while I was a River fan. My little brothers became fans of Racing. I have
    to say, though, I'm not much of a soccer fanatic."
