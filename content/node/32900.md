  body: "It's a logo. Custom drawn. \r\n\r\nFrom the FAQ: For example if you\u2019re
    looking for the Gucci logo or the typeface used for the Bj\xF6rk \u201CVolumen\u201D
    DVD release, do a search by keyword for \u201CGucci\u201D or \u201CBjork\u201D,
    make sure you look in text of messages and limit your search to the Type Identification
    Board. (BTW they\u2019re both custom drawn so that\u2019s tough noogies.)"
