  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I wandered about Mid-city and the LGD to find and photograph some of New Orleans' unique signage. The imagery and type found runs the gamut from hand drawn and painted to neon and commercial. The signage represents a part of New Orleans culture and parts of my life, past and/or present, pre-Katrina and changes post-Katrina.</p>
<p>Locally owned corner store whose exterior used to have a only a spray paint piece of plywood to display its name

The Abstract Bookshop. Once a youth hostel/cafe/bookshop with poetry, music and plays turned recovery home for persons with addiction and mental illness. Now closed, but still a beautiful part of the Magazine Street landscape.

<p>Upset #1: Since Katrina, the strip mall that housed RockNBowl, Central Latino SuperMarket and a thrift store has been remodeled leaving the exterior bare and bland- stripping away the beautiful handrawn type that made it so homegrown and had really expressed the vibe of Mid City Lanes.

<p>Upset #2: As I began my assignment I knew that the very first sign I wanted to photo was the Crystal Preserves sign in Mid-City off I-10. This sign in particular has always had a special meaning to me. When I was a kid and my parents would take my sisters and I to plays, ballets and concerts downtown we would head home, getting onto the I-10 at Tulane and Carrolton. I would stare up out the window at this huge glowing sign and know that my parents were finishing off the night by treating us to beignets and hot cocoa at Morning Call. I was highly upset to see the sign gone, which still stood after Katrina, and some sort of condos being built where the Baumer Foods factory stood =(
