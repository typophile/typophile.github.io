  body: Hey Ricardo. Surely, you have a future....;&#41; <BR>You found typophile and
    that&#39;s a good start. <BR> <BR>With &#34;gimmick&#34; fonts...one suggestion...
    <BR>don&#39;t attempt to repeat the gimmick  <BR>on all the letters. <BR> <BR>Btw,
    in this case,  <BR>by &#34;gimmick&#34; I mean the wavy round structure. <BR>
    <BR>It can work on some letters, but on the H, I, J, L, T... <BR>it gives a person
    vertigo. <BR> <BR>What program are you using, just curious. <BR> <BR>good luck
    and try back with some other stuff. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj

  body: im strongly supporting bj&#39;s advice not to go too far with the gimmick.
    its some subtle richness of form that makes &#39;gimmick fonts&#39; much better.  <BR>
    <BR>goodluck

  body: Hello Ricardo,  I only see now your font and I want to leave some ideias and
    sugestions. <BR> <BR>Lowercase letters <BR>c - more condensed <BR>g - the round
    parts of this character are a little bit different of others similiar &#40;b,d,p,q&#41;
    <BR>x - more expanded <BR>w - probably more condensed <BR>y - I prefere the last
    version because the leg is more identical of the &#40;g&#41;. <BR> <BR>The lowercase
    letters seems that have few characteristics from the Uppercase. Probably they
    must have more points in common to have more coerency betten the two parts, its
    my suggestions.  Good luck for the work. <BR>Regards / um abra

    and &#34;z&#34; need to be more curvy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
