  You know, the little numbers and letters that run along regular 35mm film negatives.
  Unfortunately I haven't been able to google up a detailed picture, these one are
  the best I can find.\r\nIt doesn't have to be the exact font, any similar sans serif
  will do.\r\n\r\nhttp://home.germany.net/101-81660/keycode.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://home.germany.net/101-81660/randnum.jpg"

    to see? These examples are too small!

  body: The number looks like a Univers Extended to me. The Kodak looks like a Modified
    Franklin gothic Wide. The O in particular looks like the modified Character. That's
    my best guess.

  body: "Well, any medium where focus is not always perfect ends up rounding  corners.
    I can't think of a way besides over-sharpening to counteract that. A lot of fonts,
    even original digital ones, have thorns (although usually very mild ones). Probably
    because human vision itself has imperfect focus.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
