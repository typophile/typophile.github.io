<p><em>Who designed the shape of the credit card? And why is it exactly this shape that became almost the omnipresent, universal type of card?</em></p>
<p>I know, that it&rsquo;s shape is standardized by the norm ISO/IEC 7810. I also know, that the shape is pretty similar to the size of business cards in certain countries. So maybe, the shape was adopted by the already common medium. But that would lead to the question, why the business card is shaped the way it is. But maybe I&rsquo;m going the wrong direction here.</p>
<p>I thought this forum might be a good place to search for answers. Any ideas?</p>

However, if you look at the length and height of it, (84mm x 54mm) you will notice that the proportion of length to width is 1.59, which is incredibly close to the Golden Ratio (1.61803399).</p>
<p>And the corners of credit and bank cards are rounded so they are less likely to bend or get stuck in an ATM.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My guess is that the standard credit card size was based on size of business cards, which derived from the size of Victorian calling cards. There&rsquo;s an interesting article about calling cards at <a href="http://www.paperpenalia.com/cards.html">http://www.paperpenalia.com/cards.html</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;By Victorian days, a tightly structured hierarchy of card size&hellip;was used&hellip;The largest cards, measuring 3 3/8&rdquo; x 2 1/2&quot;, were reserved for married couples. A man could choose a card of either 3 3/8&quot; x 1.5&quot; or 3.5&quot; x 2&quot; dimensions. Sizes then ranged down to that for a married woman, a single woman, an unarried daughter still living at home, and a child, who had the smallest card at 2.25&quot; x 1 3/8&quot;&hellip;&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting, but if there is a connection between card size and paper size, I wonder if the connection might be the reverse — that stock was made to that size because it worked well when printing the most popular card size.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As to the chicken-and-egg question of card sizes, since today&rsquo;s 3 1/2&quot; by 2&quot; size was one of the Victorian alternatives, the first place I would look for an explanation would be at the standard sizes of paper stock.</p>
<p>Thus, the standard 8 1/2&quot; by 11&quot; page size derives from (American) Demy Quarto/4to.</p>
<p>But someone already noted that it derives from an American size of paper stock instead of a British one, so I&rsquo;m puzzled.</p>
<p>As to the credit card, the ISO/IEC standard gives it as 85.6 by 53.98 millimetres, which is close to 3.37 by 2 1/8 inches.</p>

Let me share something about credit card payment protection. Any person who has or is going to open a credit card account sometime in the future may get provided payment protection. On the face, it seems like advisable, but actually, it&rsquo;s a shell game that&rsquo;s dangerous for one&rsquo;s wallet.

		<div class="commentbody">It is, indeed the business card format&hellip; back in the 1950&rsquo;s, when Bank of America in San Francisco, began to notice that merchants were essentially acting as banks when the merchants managed substantial &ldquo;lay away&rdquo; payment programs, and in an effort to compete against this, BoA initially gave &ldquo;chits&rdquo;, literally typed with hand written signature pieces of paper, to their more trusted clients so they could go to to specific merchants for &ldquo;credit purchases&rdquo;&hellip; then it was just a matter of experimentation to formalize and standardize these &ldquo;chits&rdquo; into familiar and convenient &ldquo;cards&rdquo; that would be easy for anyone to carry around.</div>

<p>The Charg-a-Plate was 2 1/2&quot; by 1 1/4&quot;, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card|same Wikipedia article]] notes.</p>
<p>A business card, in the U.S. at least, is slightly smaller, at 3 1/2&quot; by 2&quot;.</p>
<p>There is no traditional paper size that is either 8&quot; by 14&quot; or 14&quot; by 16&quot;. There&rsquo;s 8&quot; by 10&quot; and 8 1/2&quot; by 14&quot;. And there&rsquo;s Large Post at 16 1/2&quot; by 21&quot; if one wants to go duodecimo&hellip; or, rather, 48mo.</p>
<p>However, the credit card&rsquo;s size <strong>is</strong> neatly related to Foolscap, at 17&quot; by 13 1/2&quot;; 17&quot; is 2 1/8&quot; times eight, and 13 1/2&quot; is 3 3/8&quot; times four.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true, and I suspect the reason that came to be is that the credit card companies needed to make their cards fit into the already existing slots and holders in wallets and purses that were already filled by business cards, driver licenses, ID cards, Social Security Cards, wallet photos, etc. How that size came to be the standard in, at least, North America, I don&rsquo;t have a clue.</div>
