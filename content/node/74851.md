body: "Hi folks!\r\n\r\nI'm a long-time member of this fine place, but alas I rarely
  post. This is the first time I start a thread and I do hope I'm posting in the right
  forum section.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, a dear friend of mine wrote me:\r\n\r\n<em>Since
  the beginning of this year, I've been working in a section of the Publications Office
  of the EU that deals with copyright. A few days ago I was given the task of revising
  a part of our site that deals with multimedia publications in terms of copyright.
  The paragraph about fonts (archaically called \"founts\") reads:</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Founts
  are sometimes subject to copyright protection, for example the fount currently used
  for the Official Journal of the European Communities (Albertina), and are thus not
  automatically usable in other circumstances without the prior written permission
  of the rights owner\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em>I was thinking of rephrasing it like this:</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Some
  founts are a commercial product and can only be used if they have been regularly
  purchased. For example, the fount currently used for the Official Journal of the
  European Union (Albertina) is produced and sold by Linotype GmbH and must be purchased
  from them to be used.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Then I showed it to my direct superior,
  who told me that there are open source fonts, commercial fonts and other kinds of
  free fonts that can be used free of charge only by mentioning the author of the
  font. I've never heard of the latter category, but maybe you can enlighten me (Google
  wasn't much helpful).</em>\r\n\r\nI told him that I've never actually encountered
  such a condition of use on fonts. Or at least, not phrased that way. Instead, I
  have encountered the familiar \"This font is free for non-commercial use\" or \"...for
  personal use only\". \r\n\r\nSo, what I'm asking you is basically this: Is my friend's
  boss correct in claiming that there are \"other kinds of free fonts that can be
  used free of charge only by mentioning the author of the font\"? It doesn't sound
  right to me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your attention and insight!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRick\r\n"

  body: "The license of the font <a href=\"http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/\">Kerkis</a>
    (a nice Greek accompaniment to Bookman) states that\r\n<cite>\r\nIf you want to
    use this font family in commercial work (like in books) you *must* include in
    the Copyright section the fact that you are using \"Kerkis (C) Department of Mathematics,
    University of the Aegean\".\r\n</cite>\r\nThe font is otherwise free to use.  However,
    I think Kerkis is now also licensed under the LaTeX Project Public License, and
    that license does not have such a restriction.\r\n"

  body: "You can not \u2018purchase\u2019 fonts (like most software) \u2014 you pay
    for a license to use them, the cost of which depends on the way the font is deployed
    and the number of computers it will installed on.\r\n\r\nThe so called free fonts
    mostly use a licensing scheme where personal use is free, but commercial usage
    is subject to a fee. \r\n\r\nThe whole attribution issue is debatable \u2014 I
    have never seen a EULA for a free font where this was a requirement. Distribution
    is a different aspect: you are required to keep font and EULA together when redistributing."
