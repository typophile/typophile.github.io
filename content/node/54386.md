  body: An extra heavy squarish wedge-serif, eh? Serpentine has some similar characteristics,
    but too much contrast and the serifs aren't big enough, at least in the bold version,
    which is all that I have.... hmm...

    Prince]], or [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/oldstock.shtml|LHF Old Stock]]
    which is slightly more ornate.

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions,\r\n\r\nThe first place I ran was to Letterror
    and Letterhead too. Federal is nice, but it has too much contrast. Serpentine...
    is, well... Serpentine. Oldstock is close, but too ornate.\r\n\r\nAny others come
    to mind?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nMichael"
