  off something this ornate. I know there are some serious issues with this guy, but
  I'd love some helping identifying some priority fixes since this goes to print in
  less than 24 hrs. Any feedback would be very appreciated!\r\n\r\nAlso, I started
  cutting away sections of the path where things overlap, to give it a ribbony, dimensional
  feel. Do you prefer with or without?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heart_Script_3470.jpg]"

  body: Just be careful about how you create the gaps, as it appears from this image
    that you're often making little dents in the sides of the stroke in front.

    it creates more complexity and delights the eye.  i won't comment on specific
    cuts.  I will make a note that i like that you also have areas where you make
    just one cut, like the tail of the \"R\" so that you're only breaking the line
    on one side.\r\n\r\ngood luck with the final drive.  And, i guess, Happy Holidays."

  body: "I think one adjustment that would quickly add a bit more finesse to the design
    would be to make upstrokes uniformly thin, and downstrokes thick. In the letter
    /e/ for example the stroke leading in would be thin up to the loop and come back
    down thick. Same for /s/; the spine is the downstroke. Make the spine thick and
    the stroke leading in thin. For /o/ the stroke on the right would be thin. Same
    for /v/. With /w/ you've got two downstrokes and two up. Down up down up.\r\nIt
    may be a bit much to master in the next 24 hours, but the reason why the shapes
    of some of the letters, particularly /a/ and /o/ appear to have kind of clumsy
    left-leaning strokes is because (1) the bezier anchors are poorly placed on the
    curve, and (2) their control points are overworking on one side of a given line
    segment, and underworking on the other. To correct this, place anchors at the
    extrema of the contour, and pull their control points out at right angles. Control
    points should distribute somewhat evenly the 'tension' applied to each side of
    a curve. You may need to insert some additional anchors, or pull a control point
    off to an angle other than a right angle while making adjustments, but most all
    what you're trying to do here is accomplishable using the method here prescribed.
    It is not all that intuitive of a process, and you may want to give up now, but
    this is how to fix the specific problem with your curves."

  body: Thanks Dave! All this is really helpful! Trial and error has been a useful
    way to learn, but these little tricks will help me avoid a lot of trouble.

  body: "Awesome! I love it!\r\nGreat work!\r\n\r\nSome feedback:\r\n- The top of
    the /a/ bowl can be closer to the stem. So the counter centerline has more slope.\r\n-
    The weight on the /N/ should be on the diagonal stem, not in the verticals ones.\r\n-
    Not sure about the /e/ in \"New\".\r\n- In York: the /Y/ can be wider, and the
    /o/ narrower.\r\n- The ribbon effect can be a little distracting, use it sparingly."
