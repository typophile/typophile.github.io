    Lettering Machine. Nick Curtis has a 3-weight font called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/planscribe-nf/?refby=bowfin|Planscribe]]
    that is based on the output using the Leroy device. It is not an identical match,
    but its feeling is similar.\r\n\r\nI could not find a more similar font.\r\n\r\n-

    Mike I saw the results of a lettering machine, but none of the digital ones  AFAIK
    has this G. I also drew a blank by an extensive review of sans-serif fonts with
    rounded ends.\r\nAny information as to where you saw this?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Good find Dick! Always a good idea to check the boutique publishers like
    Milieugrotesque that are not at Myfonts.\r\nBTW this is a most peculiar font,
    sans for the upper case, serif for the lower case, both monoline. Does the \"Senza\"
    in the name stand for the hybrid nature of the font?\r\nI gather that it is based
    on the typewriter font in an IBM Selectric typeball or element [what Milieugrotesque
    \ calls a golfball]  designed in the years when IBM was a real design powerhouse.
    These designs are a goldmine for digital font makers. \r\nOn refection, a hybrid
    font is an elegant solution for the problems of a monospaced/typewriter font.
    The serifs on the lower case help to fill the fixed space. The absence of serifs
    on the uppercase means that the there is less of a horizontal squeeze on the letters
    to make them fit the fixed space. But this is speculative, as it seems that the
    original IBM font was only provided as an serifed italic.\r\nDon"
