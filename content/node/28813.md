  why? Is evolution of type and evolution of alphabet 2 different things? From what
  i know, they are interlinked but i got the message across from someone elses forum
  that they were 2 different things. Please explain. What books would you recommend
  i  look at for more information. '

  body: First, you should clarify whether you really mean 'alphabet' in the technical
    sense of the term. Not all systems of writing are alphabets. The invention of
    the alphabet preceded type, and the invention of type preceded the use of alphabetic
    writing systems where it was first used (East Asia). Or do you mean to restrict
    the discussion to the use of type related to the Roman alphabet, and perhaps you
    are thinking about the evolution of the canonical letterforms of the alphabet?

  body: "Well, my language is Korean, but you are talking about the writing system.
    Korean is written primarily in the native Hangul alphabet nowadays, but this wasn't
    invented until the 15th century. Before that, Chinese ideographs were used, and
    nearly all written material was in classical Chinese. The educated elite continued
    to write in classical Chinese long after Hangul was invented, and Hangul didn't
    really become predominant until the 20th century. Printing has a long tradition
    in Korea that precedes the invention of Hangul by centuries--in fact, the oldest
    surviving Korean printed document, a Buddhist scripture, dates from 751. So most
    pre-20th-century Korean type is for Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, there's
    a Chinese-Hangul bilingual inscription on a tombstone in northern Seoul that warns
    those who would disturb the tomb, and also declares that the Hangul version was
    added for the benefit of those who couldn't read writing. Says a lot about the
    status of Hangul in those days when reading in the vernacular script didn't even
    count as reading.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the thousands of glyphs needed for Chinese character
    type means that the evolution of type takes a very different course in Korea.
    Because of the amount of labour that went into producing type, type production
    was largely state-directed.\r\n\r\nMoveable metal type developed in the 13th century
    and by the time of King Sejong, the inventor of Hangul, metal type production
    was at a sophisticated phase. Typically metal type would be cast based on the
    hand of renowned calligraphers. The so-called <em>Gabin</em> casting of 1434 was
    based on a certain hand available in some hand-written books, and missing glyphs
    were supplied by the future King Sejo, one of Sejong's sons.\r\n\r\nHangul is
    a much more interesting example because upon its creation, it was immediately
    was cast in moveable type. It must be unique among the major writing systems in
    this respect. The very first document produced using this script, the <em>Hunmin
    Jeongeum</em> (1446) is a manuscript, but the first Hangul type was cast in 1447
    for used in the mixed-script <em>Dongguk Jeong-un</em>, and it was followed in
    1449 by <em>Seokbo Sangjeol</em>, the first Hangul document printed in moveable
    metal type. (Edited because I had this wrong--I thought <em>Hunmin Jeongeum</em>
    was printed.)\r\n\r\nEven though Hangul is an alphabet, the letters are arranged
    in syllabic blocks, so the blocks are the basic units for traditional Hangul typeface
    design. As the number of Hangul syllables is almost endless (see the Unicode chart
    for Hangul syllables), the situation was similar to that of Chinese characters
    and again producing Hangul type was a state monopoly until I think maybe the 18th
    or 19th century. As an invented script, the first Hangul typefaces had really
    geometric designs (think Futura), and it looks like the same type was used for
    the glyphs \uB208 and \uACE1 for example, just flipped over. Later typefaces mimicked
    calligraphy more.\r\n\r\nI thought I would answer about Korean and type in general,
    but since you specifically asked about typewriters, I'll add that the first Hangul
    typewriter was introduced in 1949 by Gong Byeong-u. There are a number of typewriter
    solutions for Hangul, but I think Gong's separates syllable-initial consonants
    and syllable-final consonants as different keys, so it's called <em>sebeolsik</em>
    (\"three sets\", that is including vowels as the third set of keys). It's a really
    beautiful solution, and many modern Hangul typeface designs owe a lot to the letterforms
    produced by Gong's typewriter."

    and used for communication purposes, if that helps any further.

  body: "Korean typewriters produce horizontal text, left-to-right and with lines
    going down, just like how the Roman alphabet is written. I think there are some
    \"advance width\" tricks to make sure the syllabic blocks are formed properly,
    but otherwise the mechanics are the same as in Roman alphabet typewriters.\r\n\r\nTraditionally,
    Hangul was written vertically, but nowadays Hangul is always written horizontally
    for longer text unless one is going for a faux-antique look. Now that I think
    about it, the introduction of Gong's typewriter may very well mark the shift in
    momentum to horizontal writing for Hangul.\r\n\r\nThe 20th-century shift from
    vertical to horizontal writing presents some interesting issues for Hangul typeface
    design. Digital revivals of pre-horizontal-writing typefaces have to pay attention
    to the horizontal alignment of the glyphs. Until around the 1980s, Hangul typefaces
    used the same sort of glyph designs as the pre-horizontal-writing typefaces, only
    arranged horizontally and with a centred alignment. Nowadays, text typefaces are
    being designed so that the lines have a slightly higher centre of weight, which
    I think works better for horizontal writing.\r\n\r\nFor fun, I have tried out
    writing Hangul vertically by hand a few times, but I can't quite seem to get the
    alignment and spacing right."
