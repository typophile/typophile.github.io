body: Hello Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently working on a logo for a new, secular,
  private high school named after Aristotle. The Aristos Academy. <BR> <BR>Was hoping
  to get some suggestions for typefaces from that particluar era &#40;384-322 BC&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Any and all feedback would be much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: You&#39;re right, a lapidary font is the way to go. But I can&#39;t stand
    lithos :/ Are there any other alternatives?

    if there is a way to access to past GX weights will be a good choice too.

    is free&#41; and browse to Developer -&#62; Applications -&#62; Extras or Developer
    -&#62; Extras -&#62; Applications or something like that on your Macintosh HD.
    In there find and run WorldText.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately you have to install the
    whole half-a-gig of Developer Tools to get to WorldText. But some of those tools
    are important anyway. <BR> <BR>In one of the menus, click on &#34;Show Typography
    Palette.&#34; The Features tab works for Skia, Hoefler Text and Apple Chancery,
    and maybe a few other Apple fonts. The Variations tab works only for Skia. You
    can create a range of widths and weights with it.'

    an Illustrator or InDesign document. So if you want to do some fancy titling using
    AAT, you don&#39;t need to own UniQorn.

  body: I know the focus of this discussion &#40;as is appropriate in a Typophile
    forum&#41; has been on the typography, but now that I see that there&#39;s actually
    a graphic logo, I think you should get away from a Greek-inspired typeface entirely.
    &#40;And actually, Trajan is Roman-inspired. Just saying.&#41; <BR> <BR>The centaur
    image is strong -- I think it should dominate. The Greek-looking type really takes
    away from the potential power of the centaur. I think, looking at the Trajan variation,
    the type should be about 60% of its current size. I would suggest using a classic-inspired
    family -- <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/centaur/">Centaur</a>,
    perhaps? Just a little joke, but it is a nice typeface. Bears a couple of similarities
    to Trajan but is actually a full family and can provide you with a lot of flexibility
    for the myriad applications a school logo will engender.

  body: I&#39;m torn. I understand what you are saying Mr. Dave, but at the same time,
    I think the centaur is already dominant. The masculinity implied by Sophia &#40;even
    with that name&#41; overpowers the conservative Trajan. Trajan seems to obvious.
    If the Sophia is too liberal, perhaps Centaur might be nice.  And Mr. Dave&#39;s
    comment concerning flexibility is correct. <BR> <BR>Although, Centaur is no more
    Greek than is Trajan.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    not true.&#41; <BR> <BR>Quite right about Centaur being Roman-inspired, like Trajan.
    Those Romans really had a good thing going. <BR> <BR>One side note: there&#39;s
    a slight misspelling, not that it matters, on the Greeking. It should be &#34;Lorem
    Ipsum Dolor.&#34; But it got me to thinking: maybe the Greeking for a private
    academy should be &#34;Lorem Ipsum Dollar.&#34;'
