  body: Aha .... Symbol.ttf. I had looked at Wingdings 1 through 3 <BR>and failed
    to find the infinity symbol. Good to know where <BR>it can be found. <BR> <BR>Of
    course Chesh has it easily at hand, but then he doesn&#39;t <BR>have easy access
    to the 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 fractions, which I <BR>find <i>infinitely</i> more useful,
    or the superscript <sup>1</sup>, <sup>2</sup> and <sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
