body: "can anyone tell me how to make icons for files (to replace the standard folder
  icon)? i'm running OSX and i know how to copy and paste an icon but i can't figure
  out how to save the file so the thumbnail retains it's transparency (like most icons
  in OSX).\r\n\r\nis this possible in Photoshop or do i need another program?\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nnick cottrell "
