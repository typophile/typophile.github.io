  is a  <BR>story about an Italian couple that come <BR>to New Zealand and settle
  on a small <BR>island in 1906.  <BR> <BR>Many thanks, kris.

  body: 'A super-thrue italian type of XX century is Giovanni Simoncini&#39;s &#39;Aster&#39;.
    Other nice book-types are &#39;Simoncini Garamond&#39; &#40;you can find the original
    Scangraphic version, with SC, at <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com" target="_blank">www.fonthaus.com</a>&#41;,
    Giovanni Mardersteig&#39;s &#39;Dante MT&#39;, Aldo Novarese&#39;s &#39;ITC Novarese&#39;
    and &#39;ITC Fenice&#39;. An interesting type, close to the period of your book,
    is &#39;Pastonchi MT&#39;. Otherway you have historical italian types, from Bodonis
    to Bembo, Poliphilus &amp; Blado, etc.   '

    you can find thrue Scangraphic &#40;Neufville&#41; &#39;Simoncini Garamond&#39;
    exactly searching &#39;Garamond Simoncini&#39;. <BR>Also &#39;Jenson Adobe&#39;
    is a classic Italian historical face.

  body: Many of these would not be very reasonable choices for setting a novel in,
    however. Most versions of Bodoni wouldn&#39;t work well, nor ITC Novarese, nor
    ITC Fenice. Simoncini Garamond is an Italian version of a French face. I&#39;d
    say that Dante, Bembo and Adobe Jenson are reasonable options. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T

    versions of Bodoni wouldn&#39;t work well. I like &#39;Berthold Bodoni Old Face&#39;,
    with expert too. <BR>Ciao. <BR>'

  body: A fresh revival of Bodoni is Noverase&#39;s Fenice &#40;ITC&#41; <BR>and I
    think it could work to set and express that novel, <BR>Mr. Kris Sowersby; it keeps
    some romantic features <BR>but it is more arrogant in the serifs. <BR> <BR>Otherwise
    I would use a slab, maybe one which looks <BR>quite black on the page, I can&#39;t
    figure out which one now. <BR> <BR>PS/ <BR>I just got acquainted with a guy from
    Massey University, <BR>Wellington. I hope to visit New Zealand in the future!
    <BR>Hej, I could design that typeface for you! <BR>Are you in a hurry? Two years?

  body: Two Years, Alessandro? Why so long ;-&#41; <BR>I would love to, but I can&#39;t
    afford it. Give <BR>ua a buzz if you ever come to NZ. I&#39;ll show  <BR>you around
    if you like. <BR>Thanks for all the suggestions, though. I was starting <BR>to
    panic a little, thinking I knew of no Italian <BR>types, then remembered that
    there are  <BR>many fine ones. History, history.  <BR> <BR>As a side note, are
    there many &#39;contemporary&#39; <BR>Italian type foundries? I am sure that there  <BR>are,
    but I don&#39;t know of any.  <BR>

  body: Four years for the foundry :-&#41; <BR>For tomorrow I can send you the comma
    in OpenType format. <BR>Italic 1.0 is set Giovanni De Faccio&#39;s Rialto <BR>and
    Fabrizio Schiavi&#39;s CP Company &#40;<a href="http://www.fsd.it" target="_blank">www.fsd.it</a>&#41;.
    <BR>Hermann Zapf read &#34;Italic 1.0&#34; because I bought a copy <BR>in Rome
    another dude from down here sent him. <BR>Counting years, I&#39;ll be in the &#34;Italic
    5.0,&#34; cool!
