  body: They make me think of late 70s album covers. Total Elton John and cocaine
    business there. As to whether I think they&#39;re pretty, well...

  body: I dunno. That&#39;s cool for a style but there really isn&#39;t much beyond
    quick pentool and paintbucket illustrator 8.0 <BR>Now something brilliant. A script
    version of Babyteeth. That would be brilliant.

  body: 'The Hellobye stuff seems like pretty standard fashion-type stuff. I do like
    #14 at the hellobye site, but only in concept. I get quite frustrated alot of
    the time by this kind of stuff.  It&#39;s Hot Right Now, but it wont hold. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s intimidating enough how much can be done with computers and printing
    without people doing something so &#34;whimsical&#34;. Bloody fashion. So why
    is it that I go out with a fashion student? Hmm. Still, after all that the style
    is pretty cool. Very &#34;ephemeral&#34;. This person must do something that&#39;s
    really cool, doing all those shows and projects. <BR> <BR>- Chris'
