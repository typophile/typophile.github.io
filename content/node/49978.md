  body: "I think it is a combination of two typefaces\r\n\r\nThe R could be caslon/roman
    \ \r\n\r\n http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caslon/3-roman/\r\n\r\nAnd The
    ZA could be the same font with the serif's chopped off or\r\n\r\nPrado BQ-Med\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/prado-bq/med-osf/\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, "
