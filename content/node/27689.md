  body: The logotype is probably a customized Optima (judging from the lowercase "s"
    which isn't easy to draw). It could be a font also, I just can't identify it.

  body: "Hi Ole\r\n\r\nCould be a redrawn or squished version of ITC Newtext or ITC
    Novarese in the logo there - the 'f' is not like Optima, but there appear to be
    some minute flange-type serifs and a sharpness in the hook of the 'f'. "
