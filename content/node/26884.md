body: Trying to figure out if this font exists as an actual font or if it was doctored
  by the designer &#40;Tried to contact the designer, but no response&#41;.  Looks
  sooooo similar to Fonts at Typotheque and LucasFonts, which makes me think it&#39;s
  german/dutch, but nothing matches the lowercase &#34;a&#34; and upper &#34;G&#34;
  along with the small caps and other letters. I&#39;ve included as many letters as
  possible. Hope that helps.  Thanks!  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21290.gif"
