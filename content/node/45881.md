  no one at any board I've asked around at knows what font this is. I know it's a
  font because I've seen it on a few sites in the past. I contacted the owner of one
  site about it, but he didn't remember the name of it as it was on his old PC. Can
  one of you indentify it? Thanks in advance for any help!"
