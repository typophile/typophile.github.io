body: "About the dagger:\r\n\r\n1) Why is it full-height in so many fonts? Aren't
  daggers mostly used for footnote references (along with the the asterisk and double
  dagger)? So if it's going to be \"superscripted\" anyway, why not make it like that
  from the start, like the asterisk?\r\n\r\n2) The only use I know for a full-height
  dagger is when people use it to mean that somebody is dead (a usage that Bringhurst
  limits to European typography). But then, they'd actually want a cross, not a dagger
  (one would hope!). So, does that effectively preclude all-too-pictorial renditions
  of daggers as shown in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/10860\">this older
  thread</a> (scroll down to 2 April)? \r\n\r\nBasically, I'm wondering if I can get
  away with a superscript dagger that looks a bit more like a dagger than a cross,
  or if I'd have to \"neuter\" it so that it can pose as a cross; and/or include an
  additional (full-height) cross. Opinions?"

  body: A puzzling conundrum indeed. Certainly in a text font you'd want to superscript
    the daggers. The total height would probably be more than an asterisk since there
    is less to them visually. But for a display font, pretty much anything goes. Like
    so many things, it comes down to what the font is meant to be used for.

  body: "The reason is that sometimes the dagger is not used in it's super script
    form. For example if you use a dagger in tables you probabaly wouldn't - for the
    same reason you usually don't use old style figures in a table. You also would
    not want to superscript at very small sizes. \r\n\r\nIf you did design your unicode
    glyph dagger for superscript then undoing that so that the dagger can be used
    like a lining figure would be much harder than making it super script either manually
    or by using included super script functions that many programs offer. So unless
    you have a client that specifically uses their dagger in just one way I don't
    think deciding to make your dagger in a superscript size is a good idea. \r\n\r\nThinking
    about the case of numbers numerals (or ciphers as I discovered they are sometimes
    called) as an example, ideally you do have real superscript numbers in a font.
    And some fonts do. Also, there are unicode positions for superior 12 & 3, and
    for inferior points for all (1234567890), So similarly there could theoretically
    be a a unicode point for a super script dagger but because the dagger is rarely
    used it suspect it isn't enough of a burning issue for anyone for such a unicode
    code point to be added. \r\n\r\nThat doesn't have to stop you however. On the
    contrary! If a user wanted a quickly accessed and specifically designed dagger
    that was optically correct in it's details rather than one that was scaled, then
    when you build the font you could add the dagger unicode point to the set of glyphs
    normally included (unicode numbers) when you use the ORDN (Ordinals) feature,
    and/or SUPS ( Superscript) feature. This would give you fast access. This is not
    the only way to do it but it is the way that makes the most sense to me at this
    point. This is how some fonts let you type unlikely fractions such as 4/8. \r\n\r\nIf
    you wanted access in a program that doesn't have ORDN etc, but does support another
    feature then you could misuse a feature like CALT and type \u2020 and a code like
    'su' (\u2020su) and, hey presto! Then again to save time it would actually it
    would be easier to type '*t' or some combination on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nA bit
    of trivia coutesy of Phil Baines\u2019 Typo Quiz at St. Brides I attended recently:
    \r\n\r\nOn a cricket scorecard or team list, the dagger indicates the team's wicket-keeper.
    Notice that it is full height:\r\nhttp://arunan.50webs.com/scores2.png\r\nAlso\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"

  body: "Wow, thanks much for the replies.\r\n\r\nJason, yes it is a text font. For
    shortish text (not books), but text alright. Though a display version may follow.\r\nI'm
    currently trying to think of what kind of glyphs I'd want in there (and usually
    miss), which among others (like a number of arrows) brought up the issue of the
    \"superscript\" dagger, which I've only found in one or two fonts so far.\r\n\r\nEben,
    thanks for pointing out more \"full-height\" uses of the dagger. (Unfortunately
    I can't access the first [image] link you posted*, but I'll just believe you ;-).)
    \r\nSo in that case I guess it would make the most sense to make a full-height
    dagger, and probably even make it the default? But I'd definitely like to include
    the other one too; the SUPS sounds like a good idea. (Is that activated when somebody
    presses the \"Superscript\" button in InDesign, or would they have to access some
    obscure OT feature?)\r\nWell at the very least, I'd like to make it accessible
    as an alternate form in the glyph palette, via that little triangular arrow. (That's
    made via SALT I believe?) \r\n\r\n* Although it would be interesting to know if
    cricket (which I know absolutely nothing about) has a preference for cross-shaped
    daggers, or if dagger-shaped daggers would work as well? ;)\r\n\r\nI just ran
    across another point that might be justifying a full-height dagger, on the decode-unicode
    site: When the dagger is used as a footnote reference, these people say it will
    only be superscripted in the text, but then in the footnote itself (much like
    with numeric footnote references) it will be full-height. Which I'd expect would
    make the asterisk look really weird, though, because I have never in my life seen
    a full-height asterisk, so it can't follow the same treatment.\r\n\r\nBen: That
    is interesting &ndash; I didn't know there's a separate codepoint for the cross.
    I'm kind of reluctant to make that one though, at least not if I don't also make
    U+2670 West Syriac Cross, U+2626 Orthodox Cross, U+262A Star and Crescent, U+2721
    Star of David &c.! There <em>are</em> limits to my glyph-lust. ;-)\r\nI guess
    it's going to be an agnostic font."

    \r\n\r\nIt is also true that for tables sometime people modify fonts so that they
    have zero em width %, *, \u2042 etc that don't reflow the table. That may be a
    better model for tables than half tabular widths. And that is a custom rather
    than off the shelf font market. And yes those custom fonts do use half tabular
    width spaces and half tabular dollar and other monetary symbols. You are thinking
    in the right way. Notice too though what a specific use such a font must have.
    It is really only useful in specific places.\r\n\r\nBut all of this is just a
    long way of saying - Chris is right about making things look right first."

    :-\\\r\n\r\nEben, re the numerals and such, I see I'll need to think about this

    I'm realizing that I'm surprisingly insecure with all these little details.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    \u2042 U+2042 asterism: What a cool glyph (with a cool name too). Would the one

    business making the key glyphs really really good. Then somebody may be will to
    pay extra for the extras. As you see more and more how things are used ( & not
