  Sound text in the attached JPEG, for a project.\r\nI know its probably hand done
  \r\nBut if anyone can recommend a similar existing face I could use.\r\n\r\nHow
  amazing is the 'Cosmic' type as a mothership? Wow they had a laugh in the 70's.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\nMr B"

    it's definitely hand done. little bit of nouveau, some blackletter, a little bit
    of egyptian, and a generous toke off a doobie the size of a doberman's leg. the
    only thing this is missing is the actual van it should be painted on.\r\n\r\nrest
    is super geometric. grab a circle template."
