    currently slated for digitization but at this point in time not available . .

    meantime . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

    those Filmotype digitizations, Stuart. And I wouldn't let versions like Type Revivals'
    discourage you - they're WAY off the beaten path."

  body: "Thanks Mike! FYI, the best reference materials for these faces is the actual
    films .  . .\r\n\r\nIn general, all connectting script styles had lowercase forms
    that had both a low and a high tail ending which made different settings more
    organic depending on the letter that followed it. We intend to do this with OT
    automatically . . .\r\n\r\nIn addition, any printed specimen source materials
    we've ever seen had too much press gain which distort crotches where lines met
    and usually not enough of the character form was captured.\r\n\r\nThe process
    has been fascinating to say the least so far and I hope to begin not only font
    releases but documentation about the company and the device which I'm working
    on a book of the complete company history . . .\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart :D"
