  body: Rockwell was not developed until 1934, during a resurgence of slabs, so it's
    not really an Egyptian.

      purely a stylistic tag and Egyptian purely a historic one. MIddleton for one
      didn't seem to think so, hence Ludlow Karnak. \r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad

    name slab became popular a bit later.  These kind of categories placed on typestyles
    evolve and change. To me, a minor distinction between a slab and an egyptian is
    a nitpick--but I am an old fart, so pay me no mind :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
