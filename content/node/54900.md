  reason for posting is this:\r\n\r\nIs there a plugin for Illustrator that makes
  the bezier drawing tools to mimic more of how FontLab (or even Fontographer) is
  working. I'm getting so used to FontLab so it almost hurts when I have to draw in
  Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI have some memory that there is somekind of plugin that does
  this? Is it true? Anyone knows?"

    options out there aswell?

  body: If you're getting arm pain I'd recommend trying a drawing tablet - Wacom,
    etc. I used to get a lot of wrist pain from mouse use. Since switching to a tablet
    I rarely have any problems. You can also switch between the two.

    for sore wrists, you do not hold anything down, just flick the cursor or handles
    around and click or let go again to set. Saved my carpal tunnel."

  body: "I actually started out with Photoshop and Illustrator long before I ever
    got into type design. When I finally started working with Fontlab, I found the
    vector tool really weird, and for a while I insisted on drawing in Illustrator.
    As I've worked more and more with Fontlab, I've grown used to its tools, and often
    find them better than Illustrator. They're definitely better for doing certain
    kinds of precision work...but for some jobs Illustrator is better. They're both
    based on different philosophies about how vectors should work. Going back to illustrator
    doesn't bother me. I think in part that's because I use it for different sorts
    of work.\r\n\r\n\u2014Noam"

  body: I like Fontlab's tools for tweaking, but I prefer Illustrator for drawing.
    Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of things Adobe can do to improve Illustrator,
    but drawing the basic drawing tools work great for me. This topic comes up from
    time to time, and I've been curious to know what the actual problems are that
    make people hate it.

  body: "I really liked Illustrator 8's drawing tools. I'm not quite sure what they
    did in the later versions, but they don't feel quite the same. Since I started
    using FontLab a few years ago, it's become harder for me to work in Illustrator.
    It's mainly because of FontLab's keyboard shortcuts for moving B\xE9zier control
    handles and nodes, being able to slide nodes along a curve, being able to enter
    values for the length of control handles, and other little things that come in
    especially handy for drawing glyphs."

  body: "There's an excellent article in the March issue of Creative Review (UK) regarding
    Freehand users. There are still a surprising number of designers still using this
    sadly obsolete software. I have always preferred Freehand to Illustrator for drawing
    letters as it is just so much easier to use. Switching to FontLab was an easy
    transition as its' drawing behaviour is almost exactly the same as Freehand. I
    hate so many things about drawing with Illustrator - the way that you can't constrain
    angles when pulling a handle being the main gripe, selecting handles, having to
    use different pointers (why?), not being able to manipulate a section of a glyph,
    etc. It's a shame that when Adobe acquired Freehand they didn't incorporate Freehand's
    ease of drawing into Illustrator instead of just burying it. I still draw all
    logos in Freehand and then export the file to Illustrator and resave.\r\n\r\nI
    hope Freehand never becomes incompatible with the latest operating system otherwise
    Im buggered. Or maybe I'll have to use FontLab and copy and paste to Illustrator.\r\n\r\nNick

    made more sense, and it was a lot more accurate at the time."

    rather devout until I started designing letters. A friend of mine mentioned in
    passing the other day that there is a plug-in that lets you hold handle angles
    like Freehand does. I believe the plug-in he mentioned is the same one that is
    linked to above. I'm downloading it as I type to see for sure.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this will be a non-issue in the next version of Illustrator."
