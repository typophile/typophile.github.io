  these glyphs on and off, finally made an alphabet and a digital rendition. These
  haven't been vectored, or anything near it yet, I'm primarily working on letterforms
  right now.\r\n\r\nSuggestions and crits? I'm very new to this, I've made one font
  prior to this and it was somewhat a disaster. So, this is my second font in the
  works. Cheers to this being better than [[http://www.fontspace.com/unhinderedreams/vaguely-fatal|Vaguely
  Fatal]].\r\n\r\nUppercase draft(Blue is possible revision.)\r\nhttp://i51.tinypic.com/35ddmxl.jpg\r\n\r\nLowercase
  draft\r\nhttp://i55.tinypic.com/j7xaur.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm very open to suggestions/critique!

    you should sketch something that is not only a thin skeleton line but also explores
    how the "flesh" is formed. That will force you to answer some more questions,
    which is good.'

  body: 'Litera: Mm, child''s play wasn''t the look I was going for, actually. I''m
    quite new to the font creation process, and I wasn''t looking to just make just
    a thin font either. I tried to give them a <i>little</i> bit of body(Wound up
    reworking several characters to adapt to the new weight). Perhaps I''m going the
    wrong way about it? I''ve been treating this font the way I draw which may be
    my first drawback. Pointers?'

    the /i/, /l/ and /k/ are currently too thi, thouch in the same token I think the

  body: "1. Well individual characters have different weights.\r\n2. /g/ is severely
    unstable (falling to the right)\r\n3. /l/ seems left slanted because of the long
    bottom curve\r\n4. some bowls are square-ish others round...\r\n5. I don't think
    those tall points on /ij/ are working (bit too tall)\r\n\r\nThe thing is it's
    hard to say anything about this design because we don't know your desired intentions
    with this font. Maybe all the upper observations are desired. Maybe not. Maybe
    your font should be formal and with great finish detail or maybe wobbly.\r\n\r\nOf
    all the letters so far I like /a/ the most (even thought it needs lots of work).
    It's bowl shape is particularly interesting. But unfortunately I can't say the
    same about any of the other letters. They don't even seem to complement each other.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a rough start.\r\n\r\nWhat software do you use anyway?\r\nWhat do you think
    of your own font (be critical)?\r\nWhat are your intentions with this font?"

  body: "Litera: Yeah, I can see that about the weights. \r\n\r\nI agree with you
    about the /g/, I've yet to design what to do with /g/'s tail yet, whether turn
    it into an eyeglass /g/ or keep it in the same style, but more balanced.\r\n\r\n/l/
    is another character that didn't quite turn out how I'd envisioned it. I'll probably
    straighten out the /l/\r\n\r\nWorking at fixing the bowls, I actually know which
    direction I'm going with the bowls; that is, more rounded bowls.\r\n\r\nYeah,
    I see that as well, I thought it might have worked, it seemed an idea worth trying
    although it doesn't look as good as I'd hoped.\r\n\r\nMy intentions for this font
    are to create a somewhat playful sans-serif, playful but crisp and clean(no weird
    wobbles). I'd like it to have capabilities to be used at relatively small sizes
    and still maintain itself, it's kind of held up with the letters as they are,
    though they're quite...well. As you said, they need work. I'd also like it to
    be a professionally acceptable font, which it isn't at all at this point.\r\n
    The fonts that  partly inspired this are [[http://www.dafont.com/steiner.font|Steiner]],
    [[http://www.ffonts.net/tag/0/euphemia|Euphemia]], and the slab-serif font, [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Memphis/fonts/|Memphis]].\r\n\r\nCritically
    speaking; I like the thought of a \"playful sans-serif\"(I consider Euphemia slightly
    playful) and base idea, execution so far isn't all that I'm wanting it to be.
    I'm unhappy with the wobbles and weight inconsistencies primarily, next to widths
    of characters being somewhat haywire. I'm aiming at a font that's professionally
    acceptable(As far fetched as that sounds, it's a goal), and I don't feel I'm making
    that right now. I believe this has potential, needs polished a lot though.\r\n\r\nSoftware
    wise I use FontCreator 5.6 . I'm still new to the program right now, I've used
    it only a handful of times, cleaning up initial glyphs has taken the most amount
    of time so far next to playing with kern."

  body: "Based on the fonts you mentioned (mostly geometric) and even though you mention
    playfulness I think this is a <b>very rough</b> start and there's a lot of work
    in front of you. Your glyphs don't look geometric at all. As of yet.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you first get acquainted with the software you're using to produce some
    nice flowing glyphs and only after you know how to properly use your tools start
    developing a usable font."
