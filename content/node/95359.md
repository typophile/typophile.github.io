body: I'm working on a logo design and the client is concerned because they've seen
  a similar type treatment. I know this is a very common approach, but I'm wondering
  if there's a specific name for this kind of type treatment/arrangement?

  body: "You have combined two treatments.\r\n\r\nOne is what I have always considered
    to be the \u201Ctitle page\u201D technique of breaking down a sentence into phrases/components
    which are given dramatically contrasting settings.\r\nThis does indeed appear
    to be quite popular now in all-type posters with clever/inspirational messages.\r\n(These
    need not be symmetrical.) \r\nI call the style \u201Ctitle page\u201D because
    I believe that is where it originated, before becoming prevalent in posters and
    advertisements in the early 19th century.\r\nAlthough \u201Ctitle page\u201D is
    not a generic term, \u201Ctombstone\u201D <em>is</em> a category I\u2019m familiar
    with; I came across it early in my career in advertising, when symmetry was frowned
    upon as being dull, old-fashioned and unimaginative.\r\n\r\nThe other is the escutcheon/cartouche/label,
    which is not a free-standing item, but generally adorns an object as a logo or
    label, and has a roundness which often informs the disposition of type and lettering
    on curved paths.\r\n\r\nAs Joshua notes, there is also the dimension of \u201Cclass\u201D,
    which relates to the type styles used, more than the layout."

  body: "Joshua - thanks, I was aware this approach has been around for quite a while.
    I came across this while digging around online: http://www.flickr.com/photos/double-m2/sets/72157624084389178/\r\n\r\nNick
    - thanks, good info.\r\n\r\nLuma - the design I've come up with is certainly not
    trendy or hipster, and is very appropriate for their business, a financial services
    firm. I am aware of dribble and the hipster trend - but what makes a design 'hipster'
    is more than a particular arrangement. The two samples you posted have nothing
    in common btw."

  body: I apologize if my comment was too accusatory, I can see how it could be interpreted
    that way. Without seeing the actual work you have done, and since you were asking
    for the name of such a design style, my mind went right to the hipster branding
    site that I came across recently. It is an interesting question to ask "what makes
    these designs 'hipster'?" I am not exactly sure myself, but I do get a sense of
    the style and feel that seems trendy. The image I posted seems like it was a bit
    confusing too. It reads "THIS IS the neue This." An attempt to show the Helvetica
    trend replaced by the left hand style. I didn't make the graphic, I just found
    it and thought it illustrated what I was trying to say. Hopefully I was still
    able to be helpful and provide some food for thought at the very least!

    however.

  body: "Chris, I love that Flickr link. Some very interesting examples. \r\n\r\nI
    wonder if rounded layouts could have been inspired by traditional seals? Round
    seals have been used since ancient times and perhaps the style you're referring,
    though obviously different in several ways, was partially inspired by that look?

    etc. (I realize these may not be referring to the same thing). Digging around
    a bit today I came across the term "badge" which seems to make sense as well.

    event you're still digging for possible inspiration, or you're just itching for
    a jolly good read on the subject, I'd recommend, <strong>\"The practice of typography;
    a treatise on title-pages, with numerous illustrations in facsimile and some observations
    on the early and recent printing of books (1902)\"</strong> by Theodore De Vinne:
    [[http://archive.org/details/practicetypogra02vinngoog]]\r\n\r\nIt's a title you
    can choke on, but the book covers historical practises and how they became standard
    conventions; plus there's a turn-of-the-century plea for rational thought and
    a push for simplicity when typesetting those longer titles!"
