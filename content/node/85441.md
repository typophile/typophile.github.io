  includes a wide range of books with links for purchasing them. Please check it out

  body: I would recommend adding Lettering Design, by Michael Harvey, to the Lettering
    section. Lettering for Reproduction, by David Gates, is also good. Both of these
    books are out of print (I think) and the techniques are pre-digital, but they
    cover a lot of useful principles that are relevant to type design as well.
