body: "I have been asked if it is possible to get a font with a technically time-limited
  licence, e.g., the font dying after some time on your machine, like tryout-versions
  of applications do. Is there such a thing in the font\u2019s world? If not, would
  it be possible to develop?"

    used to use.

    on a time-based schedule and that implies termination naturally. But what about
    a font needed for offline work, for editorial composing? You\u2019d need an offline
    solution for that and need to download."

    though not really good for business to say so. \r\nThere is no function in a font
    to check either clock or calendar in the OT or OFF font formats, though it's been
    requested. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    be so wack that everyone would automatically delete it out of sheer disgust.

  body: "I suppose one could always devise some sort of devious GSUB rule which converts
    some very common letter sequence into a piece of executable code which takes over
    the OS and then does any one of the following:\r\n\r\n(a) erases the font file.\r\n(b)
    erases the users hard drive (just to make sure you get all backup copies of the
    font).\r\n(c) overwrites the firmware on any optical drives (in case they have
    offline backups).\r\n(d) starts sending deranged and/or threatening emails out
    to various government agencies (to ensure the user will be taken away and locked
    up).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this would count as good customer service.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    connections to both the Mafia and Jeffrey Daumler. We can call him \"Nunzio\"
