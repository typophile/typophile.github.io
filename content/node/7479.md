    to be set in &#39;Myriad Master&#39;, which ia assume is a typo. <BR> <BR>Si

  body: That was a bit of a cheeky answer so here&#39;s a serious one. Myriad Pro
    would likely be of most interest to magazine publishers using InDesign, so the
    best place to start would probably be the magazine publishers lining up behind
    InDesign - there&#39;s a list of &#39;customer stories&#39; at the bottom of this
    page... <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/customerstories.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/customerstories.html</a>
    and go from there.
