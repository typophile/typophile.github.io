  Ghotic, but it's not completely the same. Any ideas? Especially the round O and
  C are remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe letters are a bit blurry, but that's because it's a
  scan of a printed document. I'm sure the font is sharp...\r\n\r\nThe characteristics
  I see in thos font for are:\r\n- Round O and C\r\n- Diagonal ends of C\r\n- Middle
  \"bars\" of E and F are shorter than the top \"bar\"\r\n- Middle of M is on the
  baseline\r\n- Shape of the R\r\n- ..."

    correct. Any suggestions would be great!

    \r\nIt's more of a Futura-based typeface, though."

  body: Thanks for the tip. But I'll go for SF Florencesans. I even think SF Florencesans
    is a perfect match! I recreated the text in photoshop in a layer on top of the
    scanned text, and it matches perfectly (even the "R"). So I think SF Florencesans
    is the used font. Thanks for the help!
