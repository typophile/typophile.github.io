body: "This is how it works:\r\n<ul><li>A portion of a glyph is published in the Type
  ID Pop Quiz.</li>\r\n<li>Try to identify the glyph and the typeface. To win, you
  need to name at least:\r\n<ol><li>typeface</i>\r\n<li>weight</i>\r\n<li>character/glyph</li></ol></li>\r\n<li>Show
  off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it,
  when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your
  fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The winner produces a new challenge -- a portion
  of a glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including
  a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The person who posts a challenge can't
  win the next game.</ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and
  avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is a little too difficult, maybe
  try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27995\">Entry Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a>
  or <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28061\">Intermediary Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a>

    local business</a> used Opel Sans for its logo. Some graphic designer obviously
    was asleep at the wheel when selecting the face for the logo, though the name
    \"Opel Sans\" in the font menu must've set off some warning signal. Can't believe
    they missed that. :^/"

      I didn't think this would be that obscure (it's from one of the big foundries,

  body: "\"what really makes a cartographic sans different from, say, a neo-humanist
    sans, aside from its usage and ascender/descender/x-height?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the
    designer tells you it's cartographic, silly!  ; )\r\n\r\nSeriously, lots of typefaces
    are more useful on maps than all-caps Helvetica Condensed Light (common on maps
    in the US, sadly). Besides the concern with colored backgrounds, the size and
    orientation of type is important. All that's required is clear forms, good spacing,
    and a general ability to be read at very small sizes. Low contrast and open counters
    are preferred, and ambiguous grotesques like Helvetica are to be avoided. \r\n\r\nCartography
    tends to require very cramped layouts which force type sizes much smaller than
    we usually see in other documents. It's common for most of the information on
    a map to be set between 3 and 8 points. Maps also require many styles to differentiate
    features (rivers from lakes from roads from cities from oceans from railroads
    from altitudes from longitudes....). So a good typeface for cartography is one
    designed for small sizes, with a substantial range of weights and styles. \r\n\r\nI
    don't find Cisalpin particularly better suited to cartography than Frutiger, Meta,
    Minion, or Dante. A superfamily like Stone Serif and Sans is useful, with several
    styles in serif and sans, plus a large x-height. "
