body: "Hey guys, I'm in the finishing stages of a font, and am having some trouble
  with Robofab UFO stuff.\r\n\r\nI am able to export and import fonts to UFO format,
  using the macro panel in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nBut I want to be able to just export the
  glyphs that I have changed, instead of doing the time-consuming complete import/export
  over and over.\r\n\r\nI get this weird message everytime. I have reinstalled Robofab
  and Python, and the problem persists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone know the workaround
  for this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/error_5371.png]"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt appears that Python is trying to convert a string of text to
    ascii, and that some of the letters are outside the ascii range (0-127).\r\nI
    would check the font info fields (font naming, copyright etc) of your font and
    check whether they contain non-ascii letters.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get in touch
    with the Robofab developers quickly I suggest to check the Robofab group at Google:
    http://groups.google.com/group/robofab"

    the same problem.\r\n\r\nI joined the Robofab group, so hopefully that will solve
    the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: Are you using "DumpOneGlyphToUFO.py"? Line 32 (which is the line traceback
    says the problem is in) is trying to print the glyph name and the path that the
    GLIF is being saved to, do either of those use non-ascii glyphs in their names?
    Check the folder name for any extended characters, FontLab doesn't like non-ascii
    glyphs in its output panel.
