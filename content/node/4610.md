  Choice  <BR> <BR>When creating your Word Attachment resume, keep your font simple
  and easy to read on a computer screen. Be kind to your reader. Do not use italics

  body: Paper. That way I can control what stock my resume and cover letter is on,
    who printed it, and how it gets handled once I deliver it. <BR> <BR>If a client/employer
    requests a digital copy, PDF. Locked for editing and displays the way I designed
    it to.

  body: Alessandro, I don&#39;t get it; throughout her CV I see New Baskerville and
    Frutiger. with passable layout and legible copy. Looks fine in PDF but would look
    terrible in Word, since half of the features she uses &#40;continuous sidebar,
    alternate ampersands, small caps&#41; don&#39;t display properly in that program.
    <BR> <BR>Why did she need a better CV?
