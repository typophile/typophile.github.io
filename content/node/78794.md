  that was popular in the 60s and 70s.\r\n\r\nI've Googled, and looked at \"retro\"
  fonts to no avail. The attached picture is not exactly what I'm looking for, but
  at least give you an idea of what I'd like.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overlap_6626.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I can't use OT Pro fonts. I forgot I had Pricedown,
    which I may wind up using.

  body: That example looks a bit art nouveau. try Hedgerow or Carouselambra. Also
