  I was wondering how one\r\ncould enter this craft seriously, and which are the functions
  one could have in a type foundry developing or designing fonts.\r\nAre there many
  varieties of jobs within a type design in a big foundry? How is the working structure
  of a big type foundry like, for instance, LinoType?\r\nAnd the boldest question:
  Does anyone one about jobs in type foundries for those of us who want to work in
  type design and actually make a living of it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

    sense of the word. This is why so many type designers are their own foundries!
    But whether you're trying to succeed solo or by being an employee, first you need
    to have at least a couple of really promising designs out there, either to sell
    or to impress.\r\n\r\nSo make something, maybe post it here for a critique, and
    see where you get.\r\nJust know that it's both creatively and technically a high
    challenge.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "On the other hand some font houses have what are affectionately called \"bezier
    monkeys\" :-) who don't/can't come up with strong original designs but are highly
    valued for their \"finishing\" skills, which some \"official\" type designers
    actually lack enough of. Eric Gill for example never did any of his spacing -
    that was left to the \"boys\" at Monotype. Now, this sort of thing isn't glamorous,
    but if you happen to enjoy it, and the money it brings, then hey. Also, it can
    lead to becoming an \"official\" type designer, like it did with Ole Sch\xE4fer
    at FontFont. A number of people [formerly] at FontBureau also seem to have started
    off that way.\r\n\r\n> not long ago H&FJ was looking for a font developer:\r\n\r\nHow

    a type-specific education, there is not much choice, and the same holds true if
    you want a job.\r\nThe big difference is that it is now feasible to start your
    own foundry.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that some small foundries, although they
    may not have job openings, will take on interns. I presently have one -- it's
    a requirement of his design degree course that he works six weeks as an intern
    in a design firm."

    has that worked well, is it something of a break even, does the intern seem satisfied?

  body: "I do think that full-time, \"professional\" employment is probably hard to
    come by. You might have better luck setting your sights on freelance or contract
    employment. When I was getting into type (in the early '90s), there were a lot
    of small freelance jobs around. If you can make some friends and find those jobs,
    it's not a bad way to go.\r\n\r\nThese days Reading seems to be the most straightforward
    path, but if you have the time and energy, you can work your way up. Get the software
    and make your own typeface; that will get you some skills to use the tools efficiently.
    Then you might find a job to design something customized or ephemeral. Or perhaps
    someone needs help with kerning. Most of all, you need to develop a tolerance
    for horrifyingly long, monotonous projects -- which is a big part of real type
    work. If you cannot deal with that, I think your success will be limited.\r\n\r\nTry
    to work with and understand all the technical aspects of font production (OpenType
    layout and tables, hinting, Python scripting, etc.). It's important to carefully
    read a lot of type books, and, of course, look at a lot of type.\r\n\r\nIf you
    can get some small projects under your belt, you might find one day that you are
    qualified to help a \"real\" foundry with some contract assistance, which will
    give you more experience with how a font company needs to have their font data
    prepared. (It's often a level higher in precision and quality.)\r\n\r\nIn the
    end, like others here have said, foundries (like most employers) want a person
    with an ability to perform skillfully, intelligently and reliably. Such qualities
    usually come with experience and simply logging a lot of hours doing the same
    thing over and over again. All of this takes time, patience and commitment --
    but there are lots of ways to get there.\r\n\r\nOne more thing worth mentioning:
    Once you have the skills, you will need to convince people of that without the
    benefit of a university's stamp of approval. The value of networking and schmoozing
    should not be underestimated.\r\n\r\nI agree that having original design vision
    is optional. It's a goal that drives many people into the field, but like lots
    of other creative fields (e.g. music, theater) there are always lots of opportunities
    for skilled craftspeople who are not destined for stardom."
