  body: "One day we love someone - the next day we hate the same person. One day we
    endorse someone - the next day we turn our backs on the same person. One day our
    country supports another country - the next day it holds the same country in contempt.
    Within all of us I think there is an ongoing emotional struggle.\r\n \r\nBut I
    believe LOVE wins out in the end. "

  body: I wonder if color theory would play a role in this shirt's success. It seems
    to me up close to the person "hate" would read better and far away "love". Unless,
    of course the color of pink isn't the same chroma and then "hate" would always
    win. How sad.
