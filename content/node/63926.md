  if someone types \"forward\" then i want to replace it with \"backward\" but i don't
  want to make a glyph backward cause i have around 300.000 words.\r\n\r\nI saw this
  in the fontlab manual:\r\n\r\n*) FontLab Studio supports all of the substitutions
  except the multiple substitutions.\r\n\r\nIs there any program where i can do this?"

    like indesign then my answer is because i have to make a experimental font.\r\n\r\natm
    i use\r\n\r\nsub w' o' r' d' by r_e_p_l_a_c_e;\r\n\r\nbut to do that it makes
    a glyph for r_e_p_l_a_c_e.\r\nI would prefer, \r\n\r\nsub w' o' r' d' by r' e'
    p' l' a' c' e';\r\nso it doesnt make a glyph but that code doesnt work.\r\n\r\nAtm,
    i have added more then 1000glyphs and the font is 1,5 mb now.\r\nI i go on like
    that the font will be around 500mb which is quote heavy for a font :)\r\n\r\nhope
    those details help\r\n"

  body: "What exactly do you mean by 'it doesn't work'?\r\n\r\nDo you mean you are
    getting an error from AFDKO, or do you mean that you aren't observing 'a' being
    replaced by 'bc' when you test your font?\r\n\r\nIf the latter, this is not surprising.
    Very few major applications support one-to-many substitutions, so even if an appropriate
    lookup is present in your font, the substitutions will not be performed.\r\n\r\nFontLab
    doesn't support one-to-many substitutions, so you won't be able to code such substitutions
    there. The Adobe CS 3 applications don't support such lookups, so your font won't
    work correctly in any of those (and AFAIK, CS 4 doesn't support them either),
    nor do most other OpenType-savvy applications on the market today.\r\n\r\nOne-to-many
    substitutions are something which offers a great deal of promise for certain things,
    but they are still sufficiently undersupported that I wouldn't recommend relying
    on them at this time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's really very unclear to me why you
    would <em> want </em> to perform the kinds of substitutions which you are proposing
    above within a font. Cases where I would consider one-to-many lookups useful would
    include things like\r\n\r\n<code> sub eacute by e acutecomb; </code>\r\n\r\nwhere
    the replacement of a particular glyph by a sequence of glyphs doesn't alter the
    underlying semantics. The replacements which you are proposing, however, involve
    changes to the semantics which are the sort of thing which one would normally
    want to achieve by changing the <em> character </em> string rather than the <em>
    glyph </em> string, and that's the sort of thing which should be done by the application
    rather than the font.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you might clarify what it is that you are
    trying to achieve and why.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    could in principle make use of one-to-many substitutions to replace English <em>
    words </em> with Dutch ones, it would be impossible to replace arbitrary English
    <em> text </em> with Dutch text. Because English and Dutch syntax are non-identical,
    you'd need to have code which handles entire phrases. Since the length of those
    phrases is unbounded you'd be looking at an infinite amount of substitution code.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
