body: There&#39;s a camp send-up of old sci-fi films coming out, called <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/lost_skeleton/">The
  Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</a>. They do a very convincing job of mimicking the typography
  and effects of the time in the trailer. It also looks pretty funny.

  body: I give the trailer five stars for era-accurate typography. The music, camerawork,
    etc. seem right on target as well.

  body: By the way, if you go to the website for the movie &#40;Go <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thelostskeletonofcadavra/index.html">here</a>
    first, then click on &#34;Enter Site&#34;&#41; there&#39;s more stuff to see.
    The &#34;collectible&#34; artifacts &#40;&#34;Skelectibles&#34;&#41; are very
    nicely done.

  body: It reminded me of a B movie my father made in the late 50s or early 60s called
    The She Creature. My mother also did some calligraphy for movies during the 70s.
    I love this stuff.
