body: "I copied a piece of text with numbers from a file since I wanted to use the
  font to create another set of numbers. The trouble is when I type the new numbers,
  they look different (\"2\") and the numbers fall below the baseline (\"7\").\r\n\r\nBearing
  in mind it is the same font with exactly the same properties (baseline shift, character
  styles, paragraph settings, etc.) I cant seem to understand the problem. \r\n\r\nI
  can use the original text of numbers to create the new set of numbers but I want
  to understand what the problem is. Please help!!!\r\n\r\nIn the image, the numbers
  above is the result and the numbers below is the source from where I copied the
  numbers\r\n\r\nFont: Prelo Sans Light 7pt\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_4612.gif]"

  body: "You are using an OpenType font with oldstyle numerals enabled (the top example).
    These are often used in running text, since they tend to blend in better. The
    bottom example would be called lining numerals, in which the numbers are all the
    same height. More and more typefaces nowadays include these two sets of numerals
    and more.\r\n\r\nSwitching from one set to the other depends on the application
    you are using. If you are in InDesign, in the character palette click the flyout
    menu, then OpenType, and then (at the bottom) select the numeral style you would
    like. \r\n\r\nRead <a href=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/04/25/extreme-type-terminology-part-4/>this
