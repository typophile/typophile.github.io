    Could be bespoke and exclusive for the brand. Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/petala-pro|Petala]].
    Pro version has a single storey /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/petala-pro/bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/593980/306|a]]
    and /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/petala-pro/bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/593980/286|g]]
    available as alternates though OpenType features which should get you pretty close
    (only remaining top small spike). Other option, out-of-thebox but less close to
    me: [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/flex_bold_monday|Flex]] (backslanting
    italic /a and /g)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4329.png]"
