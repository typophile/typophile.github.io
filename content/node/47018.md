  body: "The font is called [[http://www.identifont.com/show?4UD|Mother Goose]] and
    it is from Fonthead design (Ethan Dunham). I do not see it on the Fonthead or
    MyFonts sites any more, but I have it from one of his early collections.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Sometimes designers decide for one reason or another to 'retire' designs,
    or perhaps a customer wants it to become exclusive, or maybe the name was a duplicate
    of another font and it gets renamed. In this case I really think Ethan must have
    just removed it from his collections, because I looked at every font on his site
    and didn't see it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Wow, I just found this thread. Sorry I'm late to the party. I did indeed
    remove the font because, well, it is terrible! But I have had so many requests
    for it, I put it back online for sale. I find it hilarious that WWDTM is using
    it as their logo. Appropriate perhaps.\r\n\r\n-Ethan"
