  to my question and so I am turning to Typophile:\r\n\r\nI am trying to generate
  a 6-font family for a client who uses windows (regular, medium and bold weights;
  each with roman and italics). I have managed to get the naming issues sorted, so
  that each variant displays and functions in windows/office drop-down font list.
  However, when I open the fonts panel form the format menu, windows is producing
  'bold' and 'bold italic' versions of the regular and the medium weights (I have
  attached a scan of the output which shows this) - but not in the bold weight.\r\n\r\nI
  am generating from fontlab 5  and presume that since the Bold and Bold italic versions
  are working fine, that this issue is connected to 'Font is Bold/Font is italic'
  tick-boxes in the first page of the font info panel.\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever experienced
  this/know a work-around  to solve this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"

    your regular with the bold and all the regulars with the italics (with the tick-boxes.)
    But you cannot prevent apps like Word to generate a fake bold and italic of your
    medium weight. '

  body: "Ralf thanks for your reply. \r\n\r\nTaking this information, I have been
    playing around with the settings, I think I have come up with a work-around. I
    would now like my fellow typophiles opinions on whether this would be acceptable/good
    practice:\r\n\r\n...so, noticing that the Bold and Bold Italic weights didn't
    suffer from this anomaly, I have ticked both boxes ('Font is bold' + 'Font is
    italic' in the font info pane) for all the variants. I have adjusted the the font
    naming accordingly, so that now each variant has a single typeface name and in
    effect displays as 6 different typeface families in the windows drop-down font
    list. \r\n\r\nAlthough each variant still has 'regular' and 'italic' in the font
    styles drop-down list, selecting 'italic' has no effect and the roman is still
    displayed. Similarly, clicking the 'B' or 'I' buttons does not alter the appearance.
    \r\n\r\nIn effect, the styles have been bypassed, and each font style has been
    saved as a single typeface family. This forces the user to select the precise
    weight and/or style from the font list, and prevents accidental use of the synthesised
    weights and styles. The only downside that I can foresee would be the added 'effort'
    for users who are accustomed to utilising the 'B' and 'I' buttons (though maybe
    there are other issues that I have not thought of - your opinions on this aspect
    would be most welcome).\r\n\r\nMike"

    also google for phrases like\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>\"font naming\" site:typophile.com</em>\r\nwhich
    should return some useful Typophile threads; I think almost all possible questions
    have been dealt with extensively here.\r\n\r\nWhat you did is one possible solution
    (scheme B in the PDF). Personally I think there's nothing bad about it, and with
    really big families it is the only solution to achieve cross-platform compatibility.
    Depends how one defines this, though.\r\nIn case of your three-weights family
    however, you might also try to divide your family into two families on the level
    of the 'Family Name'\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>MyFont</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[as
    'Family Name' for]\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>-- Regular</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>--
    Italic</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>-- Bold</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>--
    Bold Italic</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>MyFont Medium</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[as
    'Family Name' for <em>Medium</em> and <em>Medium Italic</em> whose 'Style Name'
    now is]\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>-- Regular</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>-- Italic</em>\r\nand
    then tick the Italic/Bold checkbox for styles <em>Italic</em>, <em>Bold</em> and
    <em>Bold Italic</em>. Further, on the FontInfo page for OpenType-specific names,
    you can name your font <em>MyFont</em> for ALL styles ('OT Family Name'), and
    name the medium weights' styles <em>Medium</em> and <em>Medium Italic</em> ('OT
    Style Name'). This will give you a family of six weights e.g. in InDesign. And
    will result in two families e.g. in Word where <em>MyFont</em> consists of <em>Regular</em>,
    <em>Italic</em>, <em>Bold</em>, <em>Bold Italic</em>, while <em>MyFont Medium</em>
    consists of <em>Regular</em> and <em>Italic</em>; the latter smaller family may
    still result in fake bolding if people use the Bold button with <em>MyFont Medium</em>
    since there's no 'real' in this family.\r\nNumeric weight values could be 400
    for regular, 500 or 600 for medium, and 700 for bold weights.\r\n\r\n[Edited twice
    or three times ...]"

  body: "The problem with this approach is that it makes the font menu that much longer,
    and doesn't group any of the fonts in a family. I hope that you are at least keeping
    the name ID 16 and 17 names correct so that OT-savvy apps can see these all as
    one family....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I take your point about the font menu being longer, and wouldn't advise this
    as normal practice. \r\n\r\nIn this case, I considered it's anticipated usage
    as the predominant (if not exclusive) corporate font on a limited number of workstations
    to be a valid motive for taking this step, as well as the fact that there is only
    6 fonts in the family. I appreciate this could become an issue should the client
    requests an expansion of the family at a later date.\r\n\r\nI did keep the 16
    & 17 names correct, and they appear as a single family in OT-savvy apps - Thanks
