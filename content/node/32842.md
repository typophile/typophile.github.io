body: "I was recently hired into a creative placement agency as a junior graphic designer.
  Their awesome brand has been poorly managed for a while, and I'm plugging holes
  right and left.\r\n\r\nThe display face for advertising and corporate material is
  Trade Gothic, primarily medium and bold no. 2. We need an alternative for body text.
  So far they have been using Verdana. Happily, a designer working within the company
  (in a non-designer capacity) knows how wrong this is and suggested that we switch.\r\n\r\nHer
  suggestion was Arial. I immediately said \"How about Helvetica?\" But I know Helvetica
  has its oddities too, from the Humanist R to the inconsistent tails. I'm wondering
  if there is something even better to suggest. I've been surfing the internet all
  afternoon looking for some good opinions.\r\n\r\nNecessities: sans serif, any and
  all media but especially print, text size; available for corporate use license without
  spending a fortune. The audience is a design-groovy company that represents designers,
  so it should be functional and interesting, but not ostentatious."

  body: "Grotesque types are great, but a corporate identity can be so much more.
    Why not ditch Trade Gothic and move everything over to typefaces with a little
    more personality?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_sans/\">Fedra
    Sans</a> is killer, does everything, and so much cooler than Helvetica. It isn\u2019t
    a cheap font, but Typotheque has all sorts of licensing options. "

    body: Thanks for the Fedra Sans link! I do love it. Unfortunately they're not
      completely rebranding, just allowing me to make suggestions where things can
      be spruced up while I'm working on it anyway. Trade Gothic won't be going anywhere
      for a little while at least.

  body: I would avoid Helvetica at text sizes, as with the other grotesque faces.
    Something with a more humanistic touch like Frutiger would be a lot easier to
    read at those sizes. <a href="http://www.linotype.com/55406/compatilfactregular-font.html">Take
