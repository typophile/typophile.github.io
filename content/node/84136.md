  project but I worry that I won't be able to set long stretches of type in it.  (Also
  yes, I know it's probably a cliche at this point, and yes, I know some other member
  set her invites in Affair, but AP is my favorite designer and Affair is amazing.)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  are there some complimentary faces I should take a look at?  Thanks!"

    theme.\r\nOld style figures (for address, date, and time) and small caps (for
    R.S.V.P.) of course.\r\n\r\nThe precious typographic noodling required to implement
    such features in text is in keeping with the mannered quality of the swashes in
    Affair."
