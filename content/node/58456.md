  released a font in which the parentheses etc. slots in the italic font house upright
  glyphs?\r\n\r\n* section 5.3.2 in my version (2.5)\r\n** he does mention a special

    in some other of his many fonts, as well. One is also free to disagree with Bringhurst;
    much depends upon the font and angle of the italic; while the effect can be pleasing
    with italics of 7\xB0\u20139\xB0, such as Novarese Italic, Perpetua Italic or
    Futura Oblique, it can also be horrifying at the pseudo-italic (shudder) standard
    of 12\xB0."

  body: Although with that example the caps are upright, too; on a quick look it looks
    like Novarese italic fonts that have sloped caps also have sloped parentheses.

  body: "So what's the point, exactly, of the upright parentheses? Craig's example
    looks pretty weird to me, and Bringhurst's argumentation \xE0 la \"makes little
    sense\" and \"generally to be preferred\" does not <em>really</em> help to penetrate
    the issue.\r\n\r\nI mean I understand that he says they aren't letters and an
    italicized parenthesis per se is a strange thing to conceive of; but certainly
    <em>if I'm speaking like this and including a (little) parenthesis in the process</em>,
    I really don't see why I should break the flow of the current italicization. <em>What
    if an entire paragraph is italicized &ndash; I tend to think of it as throwing
    the \"filter\" of italicization (is that a word?) over the entire thing. No way
    for a parenthesis to escape, and no apparent reason for that either.</em> \r\nAnd
    I mean, that question mark up there, the italic one, in the italicized parentheses,
    isn't a \"letter\" either \u2013 should it be upright too?!"

  body: "I think Bringhurst recommends this because he loves Renaissance printers
    and therefore he admires almost all of their practices. (\u201CThis rule [\u2026]
    was followed more often than broken by the best of the early typographers who
    set books in italic: Aldus Manutius, Gershom Soncino, Johann Froben, Simon de
    Colines, Robert Estienne, Ludovico degli Arrighi and Henri Estiene II\u201D).\r\n\r\nI
    admire Renaissance printers as well, and I have no doubt that they were far better
    than us, but certainly some of their ideas are not good for contemporary use.
    \r\n\r\nI mean, I love Manutius, but when I use an italic font I want to see the
    caps sloped, not upright. Same for parenthesis."

    provide kerning for when a word or phrase in italic is bracketed within roman

  body: "I have proposed the following OpenType Layout feature to be added into the
    OpenType specification. Of course, if it's accepted, it will take quite a few
    years until it's actually implemented in any major applications, if at all. Nonetheless,
    I'll let you know once (and if) it gets accepted.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\nTag:
    'uprf'\r\n\r\nFriendly name: Upright Forms\r\n\r\nRegistered by: Adam Twardoch\r\n\r\nFunction:
    Some italic fonts (such as ShinnType's Scotch Modern Italic or Peter Baker's Junicode
    Italic) will have both italic and upright forms of some characters in a single
    font: typically parentheses, other punctuation characters as well as other symbols
    such as mathematical characters or the \xA9 sign. This feature replaces the italic
    glyphs with the corresponding upright glyphs.\r\n\r\nExample: The user would apply
    this feature to replace <i>)</i> with ). In some typesetting practice, when an
    italic phrase is enclosed in parentheses within text set in Roman type, the parentheses
    should remain upright rather than italic. When the user sets the parentheses using
    the Roman font, spacing problems may occur in pairs such as the italic \"f\" followed
    by the Roman \")\". By including the upright alternate glyphs for parentheses
    in the italic font, the type designer can control the spacing and kerning behavior
    in such pairs.\r\n\r\nRecommended implementation: The uprf table maps the italic
    forms in a font to the corresponding upright forms (GSUB lookup type 1).\r\n\r\nApplication
    interface: For GIDs found in the uprf coverage table, the application passes the
    GIDs to the table and gets back one new GID for each.\r\n\r\nUI suggestion: This
    feature should be off by default. Note that not all italic fonts have italic style-linking
    in the family, so this feature should be accessible for any font that includes
    it.\r\n\r\nScript/language sensitivity: Applies mostly to alphabets that have
    distinct upright and italic styles such as Latin, Cyrillic or Greek; note that
    many non-Latin fonts contain Latin as well.\r\n\r\nFeature interaction: This feature
    is mutually exclusive with 'ital', which should be turned off when it's applied.
    It may be used in combination with other substitution (GSUB) features, whose results
    it may override.\r\n\r\n== Revise feature description 'ital' ==\r\n\r\nIn the
    feature description for 'ital', in the \"Feature interaction\" section, add as
    a first sentence:\r\n\r\n\"This feature is mutually exclusive with 'uprf', which
    should be turned off when it's applied.\""
