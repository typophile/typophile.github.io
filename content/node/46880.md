    for handmade stuff. My advice: use your hand and a pencil.'

  body: seriously.. hand done type. there's nothing wrong with looking at some fonts,
    and trying to mimic them, but no super clean computer designed font is going to
    look right next to the illustration.

    cohesive, I agree with everyone else...hand draw some type up in that black area.

  body: "Do you mean you want to find a type and then trace over it? I'd still say
    that'd be just as bad, too clean. Look at a font you like and then just eye it,
    it will make it less imperfect and fit so much better with the cover illustrations.
    \r\n\r\nOr if you're really against hand drawing it, then maybe try printing out
    the title (In a chosen font). Cut out the letters so it's individual letters,
    but tape them to another piece of paper (Just to make it less perfect) and then
    photocopy it. Then photocopy the photocopy, and so on. You'll get a more broken
    up appearance that might work well. Paste it on and do some funky coloring similar
    to the illustrations. (just an idea that came into my head)"

    Shout has a cover already. Admittedly, it's not the most thrilling album cover
    ever but it certainly exists.\r\n\r\n"

    is a Lou Reed poster he did, but he comes up with all kinds of bizarre ways to
    handmake typography."
