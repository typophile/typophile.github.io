  font, and make it looks not anti-aliased in pdf?"

    Reader not the originator of the pdf itself?

    enable the option... he will see the font looking soft.'

  body: "Are you sure you are using the term \"antialiased\", and the reverse, \"make
    it looks not anti-aliased\", correctly?\r\n\"Aliased\" is jaggy, with hard edges.
    \"Antialiased\" is with constructed soft edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing a pixel font,
    the text will (nearly) always be aliased. The \"nearly\" qualifier is because
    Acrobat <em>also</em> is able to antialias monochrome bitmaps of sufficiently
    high resolution (one can guess that to be > 1.5 x physical screen dpi).\r\n\r\nIf
    you <em>have</em> a real pixel (bitmap) font that you can use in InDesign, that
    will be passed on to the PDF unchanged; i.e., as pixels.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm pretty
    sure you cannot use real bitmap fonts in InDesign--it's way too smart to allow
    that. Perhaps you have a simulated pixel font instead ([[http://www.zone38.net/font/|Press
    Start]] comes first to mind). Those fonts are vector fonts, just like anything
    else, and just like other vector fonts it will be antialiased for screen in Acrobat.\r\n\r\nIf
    you really <em>really</em> want a pixel font, create the text as image in Photoshop
    and place that into InDesign.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can do it the other way
    around: read your InDesign created PDF into Photoshop and rasterize; then save
    that as PDF again."

    ).\r\n\r\nWell, you got the idea... \r\n=D\r\nthe font needs to look aliased,
    with hard edges.\r\n\r\nThe photoshop solution looks like a good one.\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: "Unibody is just a vector font, so it should look pretty much the same in
    the PDF as at did in InDesign. However they might be anti-aliased for screen in
    both Acrobat and InDesign.\r\n\r\nPlacing an image would probably be the best
    idea indeed."

    check box right next to smooth text.

  body: I think image smoothing kicks in only with high-res pixel images. In any size
    large enough to read, the 'pixels' of vectorized bitmap fonts are *huge*.
