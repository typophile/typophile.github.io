  I'm looking for some particular knowledge/advice. I'm working on the brand for a
  restaurant that is described as \"John D. Rockefeller and Theodore Roosevelt enjoying
  a whiskey together.\" \r\nObviously, there is a ton of reference to Victorian and
  Art Nouveau which would come right before and Bauhaus / De stijl which would come
  right after, but I'm trying to pinpoint if there is a typographic \"style\" that
  would have appeared in New York City in the year 1900. I'm trying to avoid \"western\"
  (wood type) and european (overly ornamental)...\r\n\r\nany thoughts and resources/examples
  would be very much appreciated! Thank you!"

    of NYC for that period. Any signage most likely was sign-painter's styles although
    many would be based on some metal designs.\r\n\r\n[EDIT]\r\nCurious about John
    D., I looked up his history and found an interesting fact about him:\r\n\"John
    D. Rockefeller abstained from alcohol and tobacco all his life. He saved most
    of his income and spent it on philanthropy. For this, he thanked his mother who
    taught him that \u201Cwillful waste makes woeful want\u201D.\"\r\n\r\nSo that
    restaurant might want to replace John D. with another as their inspiration.\r\n"

    Since you're in California you could also try a local library (talk to the reference
    librarian) if the NY photo collection isn't available online. \r\n\r\nFor a more
    fanciful approach you might look at the signage at Disneyland's Main Street. Not
    sure how accurate they are but they look real nice. I think there are some books
    and websites that show them, along with a Google Images search."

  body: "I take it that the cliche you want to avoid  when you say \"western\" is
    (what used to be called) French Clarendon, the usual style identified with the
    Gay '90s - think Wendy's.\r\n\r\nBut avoiding cliches and seeking true authenticity
    may go over the heads of a typographically unsophisticated public.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    something authentic probably will be recognized as old because people will remember
    stuff from old movies, old books, and so on - thus one really shouldn't be afraid
    of doing it right.\r\n\r\nAlso, the other important thing to consider is that
    the restaurant is intended to suggest a very high-class and expensive restaurant
    of that time period, not just an ordinary restaurant. That eliminates some of
    the styles of lettering used in that period - limiting one to more tasteful ones,
    less likely to be as obviously dated."

  body: "Thanks everybody for the thoughts! As I've continued to do research myself
    I've found some examples the exude that exude the feeling I'm looking for... what
    it is is Old fashioned, American sophistication... not overly ornate victorian
    wood type or wavy curvy art Art Nouveau. Good examples I have found are turn of
    the century stamps. I think the most common font (that I find to be extremely
    overused) that exemplifies this time period is Copperplate Gothic. Another font
    that I've actually used quite a bit is Columbia Titling...[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/columbia-titling/]]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    any other thoughts or examples?... I would love a resource with ephemera featuring
    a cleaning more sophisticated style."

    designing a logo for a real client? \r\n\r\nAs quadibloc referred to, if this
    is for a real client your concern isn't an authentic logo, it's a logo that creates
    the 1900's feeling and does a good job of marketing the restaurant. \r\n\r\nFew
    restaurant customers would know (or care) if the logo was authentic. You're designing
    for people in 2015, not people in 1900."

  body: "The years around 1900 were marked by the the popularity of display fonts
    that imitated hand lettering. These would have been copied by sign painters. \r\nPerhaps
    one of the most successful was the style that became familiar with _The Saturday
    Evening Post_ name plate. This was produced as Post Old Style. This was a \"rugged\"
    font -- a style that today we see as distressed or grunge. Smoothed digital versions
    are available. Consider Saturday Morning Toast NF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/

  body: "I agree that De Vinne was the height of fashion for display type circa 1900.
    There was a full range of  variations from condensed to expanded. \r\nI believe
    sign painters modeled some of their lettered signs on De Vinne. For a digital
    version http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/ \r\nNote that for
    many years the name De Vinne has been appropriated for a font that bears no resemblance
    to the circa 1900 De Vinne. \r\nThe 1900 era De Vinne is very similar to Hawthorn
