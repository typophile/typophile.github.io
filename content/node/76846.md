  from Brighton UK here attempting a typeface based on a logo i designed for our company
  - a design studio called Filthy in the UK. Attatched is the filthy logo, which is
  to be printed in a black foil and embossed, but for the moment i have added some
  lighting effects to give you the idea of the final outcome. Here i am attempting
  to create a typeface that is of a heavy weight and resembles latex when used as
  a logo (mirroring the Filthy theme).\r\n\r\nI have developed the typeface for a
  mailout and am now extending the face into a full working typeface. I believe it
  could be fairly interesting when completed. The face uses influences from rhythmic
  calligraphic stokes and from heavy weighted Caslon faces. I have added a humanist
  element to the face as well.\r\n\r\nI am doing okay with square based characters
  such as M and N, however v,w,s are all proving difficult and wondered if I could
  get a critique and advice from you all. Ill supply more artwork too when i can.
  Thanks!"
