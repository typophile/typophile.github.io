    pops first because we're used to reading black type on a white ground.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a really famous picture of Joan Crawford where the shadow of her leg looks like
    a hand grabbing at her nether regions, same thing - once you see it you can't
    not see it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hollywoodcelebrityphotographs.com/slideshow/bw/1284B-ss.html"

    by white space, not white text surrouned by black outlines.

  body: Black against white is much easier to read. Its the opposite for people with
    vision problems. Also depends on what you're eyes saw right before taking this
    in. The frontpage of typophile is white, so naturally your eyes expect another
    all white background. Try saving this page under favorites and come back after
    viewing an all black site.

  body: good definitely in the first one (for reasons others have mentioned). the
    second one it's evil that pops out first. it definitely has to do with what we're
    used to.

    first both ways.\r\nI think it's because:\r\na) The outermost contour reads \"GOOD\"\r\nb)
    As \"GOOD,\" I can explain away the unfitting shapes (the crossbar of E looks
    like a paintbrush going dry; the notches in V and L look like dripping paint).
    As \"EVIL,\" I can't explain the top line of the D especially.\r\nc) I am by nature
    a virtuous person. ;-)"

  body: "[Sorry, Patricia, I missed your earlier comment.]\r\n\r\nMiguel, simply inverting
    the black and white won't make a big difference, because you are still maintaining
    the exterior space and interior space relationship. If you change the background
    colour or the colouring of the EVIL, then you make it stand out a lot more, because
    you break the white space relationship that defines the black letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GEcol.gif]"

  body: "Yes, these are good examples.\r\n\r\nSo, lots of things come into play and
    need to be considered. Things like relation between shape and background (foremost
    element, symmetry); colour; contrast (between colours, patterns); and factors
    related with the user/viewer: mood, cultural background, intrinsic (e.g. colourblindness)
    or extrinsic (e.g. calibration of the screen).\r\nAnything else?"

    back away from the screen, further...further. The faces transfigure---good becomes
    evil and evil becomes good. This illusion doesn't work so well if you've got 20:20
    vision.\r\n\r\nI know this isn't typography, but it's a related, more detailed
    analog of the type sample done with gradients instead of hard-edged abstract forms.
    Both faces contain good and evil features defined at fine and coarse resolutions.
    The expression you see depends on how much detail is visible---depending on viewing
    distance.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
