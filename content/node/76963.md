  to me with the image below as a reference for style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref_5990.png]\r\n\r\nHis
  criteria were sophisticated, mysterious and similar in style to the image provided.
  This is what I've come up with, thus far. Still needs tweaking and I'm not sold
  on the _?_ yet:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leemayjahs01_4082.png]"

    lowercase connected script to me. And arabic (Chemical Brothers come to mind).
    Yours looks more Indian to me (and very uppercase ;-)"

  body: "riccard0: It was definitely a conscious decision to NOT make it an arab-esque
    connected script. Even though, the example is definitely lowercase, connected
    script, I chose to take the individual shapes and let them influence an inspired
    piece.\r\n\r\nT\xE9 Rowan: No idea! I've never seen or heard of it till now."

  body: "I agree with riccard0 that it looks more Indian than Arabic, but maybe that's
    fine for your purposes. \r\nThe counters of /M/ look too thin.\r\nMuch more can
    be done to have the letters fit each other better.\r\nBottom of /J/ looks thick
    and a bit out-of-character.\r\n/S/ looks very five-ish; is that okay?"
