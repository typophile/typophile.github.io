  Poland. I'd like to use typography appropriate to that time and place in history.
  Any suggestions you guys have regarding that would be great\u2014but also, can you
  suggest any reference books or resources to refer to for that sort of thing in general?
  Today I'm hunting for typography appropriate to WWII-era Poland, but tomorrow it
  might be 1850s Boston, or who knows where. I'd like to have a big fat book, or some
  kind of resource to refer to next time I need to research this sort of thing. Any
  thoughts? Your feedback is greatly appreciated!"

    Type Museum before it\u2019s closure to the public in 2006) 100 Hackford Road,
    London SW9 5OQ has all the business records (Lots of Big Fat Books) of the Monotype
    Corporation UK, along with much of Stephenson Blake, Sheffield and DeLittle of
    York\u2019s Wood Type - If you trawled through the business records you could
    find out for example which printers had Monotype casters and what matrices they
    had ordered - Monotype didn\u2019t really sell their equipment they effectively
    licenced and maintained it - a bit like Rolls-Royce jet engines today - so they
    kept very detailed records of who had what and what happened to them - copyright
    control in metal ... The Polish Type Museum\u2019s name currently escapes me but
    I believe they were signatories to the petitions and blogs opposing the closure
    of the London Type Museum - see typemuseumsociety links ...  To my knowledge no-one
    has yet conducted scholarly research into these business records ... this should
    also suggest other lines of enquiry elsewhere ... good luck Tim Martin"

    except to check with the reference department at  your local library, they may
    be able to find examples of Polish publications from that time period.

    hard to tell what exact geometric typeface is used, but I think you could easily
    get away with using Futura/Erbar/Kabel with the right type of setting.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, there's plently of serif styles as well if you prefer."

    so perhaps its appropriate, but Poland was invaded by Germany during WWII and
    I think some German fonts fell out of favor in Poland."

  body: Fraktur and other Middle Ages derivatives - if there were any in use - have
    extincted and do not exist nowadays. I have no information on what other genre
    was seen as "German" then, and I guess, that there were no people to care about
    fonts, as skilled printers, typographers etc were rather elites, what meant they
    were natural obstacles in the Grand Opus of German Reconstruction (What happened
    en masse to Jewish owners and labourers, everyone knows). And - also - Germans
    used everything found in the cases of printing houses, no matter what was that,
    "Polish" or "German"...

    to Jewish owners and laborers\r\n\r\nIndeed there was persecution of Jewish people,
    but around 90% of the Polish population during WWII were not Jewish. \r\n\r\n>
    Germans used everything found in the cases of printing houses\r\n\r\nI doubt that
    German typesetters were relocated to Poland. Invading forces are normally concerned
    with military and political matters, not taking over everyday jobs. \r\n\r\nAnd
    even if publishers were pressured into using German fonts, that doesn't mean that
    the public liked it. The Polish people hated Germany during the war and for many
    years afterwards."

  body: In my opinion Germans worked in brutal and illogical way. It is a myth that
    they were organised like clockwork (to certain degree, yes). It is sure that the
    print was controlled, and some issues demanded German hands. As Polish intelligence
    class was exterminated from the first moment and I think some of printers were
    at least suspected, from various reasons (possible sabotage, underground work
    etc). I do not think Germans introduced any typefaces known today as German (eg.
    Futura). I guess they used gothic typefaces already used by Polish German newspapers
    and for the occupied audiencies (Poles, Jews, Ruthenians) - everything found in
    the cases. So the only really "hatred" genre would be the blackletter as it signified
    apartheid.
