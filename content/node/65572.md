  documents. Ten to 60 page count, and copy and card stock paper will be used with
  the possibility of screen-printed covers.\r\n\r\nNo hard covers and preferably lay
  flat (I am open to other options). Coil and ring binding are too <em>assembly line</em>;
  I am looking for something a little more classy.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear your
  ideas.\r\n\r\n- corey"

    with a single signature. But coptic binding might be worth a shot. It'll lay totally
    flat, and it looks pretty classy.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_binding\r\n\r\n"

      option for you.You can also try adhesive binding and the lamination process
      to give a classy look to your papers.Hope you got the answer.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gbsupplies.com.au/machines-equipment/binding-machines.html/\">Binding

    is basicly a simplified version of the above mentioned coptic stich, which you
    can use when you need to bind multiple signatures together.\r\n\r\nsee: http://www.ambachthuys.nl/plaatjes/handboekbinden15.jpg"

    you have any information about the process of creating a cahier stitch?\r\n\r\nI
    guess what I am really looking for is some kind of machine that you can simply
    put a stacked number of pages and covers into, push a button and yield a binded
    document.\r\n\r\n<em>Velo</em> and <em>thermal</em> binding seem to be the only
    solutions (that I can find), now I guess I need to know what machine(s) and supplies
    to buy."

    none, really.\r\n\r\nA cahier stitch (also called a pamphlet stitch) is much easier.
    But still not easily (cheaply) done by machine. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTQVyQDufk\">Here's
    a video</a> of how to make a pamphlet stitch.\r\n\r\nHow many of these are you
    making?"

    the comb, velo, or thermal binding. There are somewhat expensive ($5K+) desktop
    perfect binding machines that will do a fine job, but the upfront cost may be
    prohibitive. \r\n\r\nI have a friend that loves these <a href=\"http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/NAVIGATION/Products.asp?Params=category=326|level=2|pageid=1749\">Circa</a>
    things for binding things around his office. \r\n\r\nI've seen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_tag'>Treasury
    tags</a> used for documents like you describe, but it may or may not be the look
    you're after. "

  body: 'Ah, coptic and pamphlet bindings are probably too involved for something
    like that. I have seen small desktop systems for poor man''s perfect binding.
    You have to use specific covers that have a channel of glue pre-applied to the
    spine. Arguably slicker than comb and coil, and probably adequate for small corporate
    jobs. '

    experiences with termal binding is that it's not very durable, especially if you
    open it flat.\r\nHave you thought about staples?\r\nAlso it's possible to have
    your cover go over your comb/sprial spine, to make it visually more attractive."

    that). Google 'wirestitcher'.

    covers for a run of fewer than 100 copies would be prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nOTOH,
    there are copy shops who could deliver a handsome product using Docupress\u2014or
