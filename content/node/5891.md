  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>I was wondering whether anyone could confirm or
  deny that the name of the &#39;@&#39; character is indeed the &#39;at sign&#39;.
  I think I&#39;m right in saying it had scientific origins, but I&#39;m not convinced
  it&#39;s true name is this. <BR> <BR>:o&#41;

    <BR> <BR>Yves, is it right that in Dutch its called the apestaart, meaning &#34;Moneky&#39;s
    Tail&#34;?, '

  body: Before PostScript, the character was known as an &#34;At Cost Symbol&#34;.
    Also refered to as a &#34;commercial at&#34;, or &#34;apiece&#34;.

  body: I&#39;ve never liked calling it &#34;the at sign&#34;. It felt clunky and
    without academic merit &#40;somehow&#41;. I think I&#39;ll start using &#34;apiece&#34;,
    very nice thank you.

  body: Hello Luke,  <BR> <BR>On the conference in Berlin this year there was a lecture
    from Alexander Nagel about the at-sign.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps you can ask him more
    about it.  <BR><a href="http://www.metadesign.de/html/en/140.html" target="_blank">http://www.metadesign.de/html/en/140.html</a>

  body: In Austria &#40; or Germany too, maybe &#41; its called &#39;Klammer Affe&#39;
    &#40; Or &#39;Klammeraffe&#39;, rather &#41;, which would &#40; roughly &#41;
    translate as &#39;Parenthesis Ape&#39; / &#39;Clip Ape&#39;.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'Joffre is right when I was at Reading University I researched it and the
    &#39;at cost&#39; and &#39;per&#39; both characters found in only American and
    Monotype character sets in the late 19th and early 20th century. Used for selling
    things..  <BR> <BR>The &#39;per&#39; design from 14..15th century English legal
    documents &#40;English Court-Hand&#41; and Latin based and the &#39;at cost&#39;
    also loosely seems to have it&#39;s origins in Latin truncation. Many other characters
    derive their origins from Latin truncation, the &#39;#&#39; &#40;pound or hash&#41;
    , the &#39;pound sterling&#39; and the &#39;shilling&#39; are all more modern
    forms of the Roman Libra as was the Italian Lira. The Roman Libra was a sign of
    monetary measurement and for weight measurement. Other characters such as the
    Rx or &#39;recipe&#39; an R with a slash through it&#39;s leg used now almost
    exclusively in America for &#39;pharmacy prescriptions&#39; is a Latin form, it
    is also a truncation from &#39;response&#39; used with the &#39;versicle&#39;
    in Latin liturgical prayer books.  <BR> <BR>This &#39;at&#39; or &#39;at cost&#39;
    seems to have survived since it found a modern use.  <BR> <BR>This an old posting
    I have still on my site of the Monotype Matrix case, one of the earliest and best
    examples of how it was part of a &#39;commercial character set&#39;. The book
    is 1916 and the date in the book as I seem to remember pre-dates Monotype, so
    it must be wrong.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.connare.com/matrix.htm" target="_blank">http://www.connare.com/matrix.htm</a>
    <BR> <BR>But the &#39;Euro&#39;. now that&#39;s Modern rubbish... is it the Cento
    sign? .. or Centi? and has no one ever clamed it to be a modern Latin form? But
    someone may call it the same at the Libra or Lira or Pound sterling, all being
    truncated characters.  '

    people would be like &#34;huh?&#34;, and you&#39;d end up having to tell them
    it means the &#34;at sign&#34; anyway. ;&#41;
