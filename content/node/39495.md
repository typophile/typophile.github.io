  loose guidelines on what faces to specify for Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic documents.
  Do any Typophiles out there have a favorite resource for international typeface
  matters?\r\n\r\nJAPANESE: So far, I know that Japanese is split into Mincho (calligraphic)
  and Gothic (monoline) categories, but I'm looking for the names of faces in these
  categories that are easily found or procured for users of Windows XP, Vista, or
  Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nCHINESE: I'm assuming that these two categories also exist for
  Chinese characters, but I just need the names of those categories and a name of
  a corresponding typeface I can recommend.\r\n\r\nARABIC: I'm ignorant. I can't even
  find if they have monoweight-stroke versions, though it's looking like the answer
  is no.\r\n\r\nAny help you could give me would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nEnrico"

  body: The forums at khtt.org don't look very well travelled (almost no posts have
    replies to them). I also looked at the Microsoft Typography page. Thanks for the
    links...those pages have some links that may have some answers to some of the
    more involved issues I'm looking at.

    Chinese, so that is something to specify when making questions about fonts for
    that language.

    and serif pairings that also had cyrillic and other language support. It's a really
    small number so far. Serifs are LT Excelsior, LT Minion, Adobe Garamond Premier

    than Traditional Chinese. More info at the links below:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_character\r\n\r\nhttp://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/chinese/\r\n\r\nMore

  body: ">Simplified Chinese has less characters than Traditional Chinese. \r\n\r\nNot
    fewer characters, but fewer strokes per character. Simplified characters are still
    ideograms, not an alphabet or simply syllables representing sounds. They were
    based on simplifications commonly used in handwriting, for speed. For formal calligraphy
    even on the mainland they often use traditional characters, which are thought
    to be more beautiful than their simplified counterparts. "

    Chinese characters, but no special keyboard. A Chinese font normally contains
    about 10000 characters, and Latin letters which include the accented ones. Here
    is how to type a character, type PinYin(no accents), the input program shows you
    all the characters that have the same PinYin(could be a lot) ordered by the tone,
    then you choose the one you want.\r\nIt takes hell of a time to finish a font
    because of the amount of characters."

    wife uses such a program. I was interested rather in how to type pin yin itself.
    For example here I have here is a pinyin word from the wikipedia article: t\xFAsh\u016Bgu\u01CEn,
    which means library. That has the u-macron and a-caron, which are not in the western
    european character set. \r\n\r\nThe MS fonts have everything on earth in them
    but the question is when people want to do signs etc in  Hong Kong and China,
    or books that give a pinyin romanization, what fonts do they go to? Do they have
    to have all the pinyin diacritics (the accents over the vowels to indicate the
    four tones) or what?   "

    As to what font they usually use, I've no idea, probably fonts similar to Song.
