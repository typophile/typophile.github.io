  body: Is this a typical British thing, calling it a knob? I picked that up from
    playing in pop/rock bands with Brits for almost twenty years, and I think I've
    never heard an American use it.

  body: "Knob, both as noun and verb, is a common Brit usage (I\u2019m not sure but
    I think <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/profiles/ben_elton.shtml\">Ben Elton</a>
    was the first to use it regularly on television, in this form and reversed \u2013
    bonk, to describe intercourse). Americans are often startled when Brits crack
    up over their use of fanny, fnarr :)\r\n\r\nAngel well done.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"
