  body: I don't know if this is valid but I would also recommend <strong>Open Sans,
    Roboto and Droid</strong>. They are all available on Google Fonts and are a free
    download (If that is a prerequisite?)

  body: '@hrant. Ofcourse. No mention of where he wanted to use. Guessed it was screen
    because he mentioned Calibri.'

  body: "It seems that Lucas de Groot made a version without rounded stems. When I
    read this on his website, I was a bit disappointed. I think Calibri would have
    looked better without the roundings.\r\n\r\n<cite>De Groot drew a contemporary
    sans serif family with subtle roundings on stems and corners.  However, as the
    roundings seemed to suffer under ClearType rendering, De Groot redesigned the
    font, taking out the rounded corners. When submitting the proposal to Microsoft,
    he sent along a sample of the original version, adding: \u2018I like the look
    of it, but as you see these rounded tops look real ugly in ClearType; don\u2019t
    choose this.\u2019 De Groot had in fact been critical of the ClearType rasterizer
    when he first saw it demonstrated.\r\nTo his astonishment, Microsoft chose the
    rounded version. \u2018As I soon found out, the rasterizer had indeed improved,
    and rounded tops and bottoms could be rendered smoothly now.\u2019</cite>"
