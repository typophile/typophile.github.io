  and footers?  Got to do an assignment to design a double page spread.  \r\n\r\nLooks
  like Times new roman or similar for body text but the footer doesn't look right?
  \ The number 9 don't drop below the baseline in the same way. when I use that font.
  \ \r\n\r\nAnyone got any suggestions?\r\nThanks"

  body: "I had started a list of magazine fonts and I had [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/minion/|Adobe
    Minion]] as the National Geographic body text. I also had noted that they used
    Galliard for some titles, and DIN and Univers for some headlines and captions.\r\n\r\n-
