  mentioned that my typographic choices reflected the aesthetic of the victorian revival
  that took place in design from the 1950s to the 1970s. he suggested that i do some
  research on victorian revival typography, but my random googling hasn't really led
  me anywhere. does anyone have any suggestions about where to look or what typefaces
  might be relevant?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "To see if there really was a \"Victorian revival\", look at magazines from
    the mid-century era, and from the previous half-century (to see if the style ever
    went away), and from the Victorian era (to see what the Victorian style is for
    yourself).\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that the so-called \"Victorian\" style was more
    prominent in mass media in the first half of the 20th century than modernism.
    I also find it hard to believe that an era which lasted 64 years only had one
    style.\r\n\r\nIn most cities there is at least one shop with a fanatic who trades
    paper ephemera, i.e. comic books, postcards, magazines, prints, movie posters,
    etc. There are also multi-dealer events annually, and these dealers also exhibit
    at flea-markets in general. it's always best to study source material first hand,
    not just read about it in books or online.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, \"Victorian\"
    typefaces, especially the grotesque style (e.g. Helvetica) featured prominently
    in mid-century modernism: in this 1960 brochure for a Danish furniture company,
    the types are a Clarendon and Monotype Grotesque (1923). However, while these
    genres of type are 19th century, they are not exact revivals, but updates--note
    the single-storey \"g\" in both.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Illums_4305.jpg]"
