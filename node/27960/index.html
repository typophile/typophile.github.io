<p>The most blatent example is uni0414 which is a stacked form in Cyrillic and in script fonts is frequently a Latin D instead. If the Latin form is acceptable why have a different Cyrillic form then? Anyone know?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;upright&rdquo; de is not a happy cursive form.

<p>No. That&rsquo;s just silly. Take a look at any of [[ParaType]]&rsquo;s script fonts and you&rsquo;ll find the same things. In fact, some slavic languages <a href="http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/4452/bgvsru9vl.jpg">including Bulgarian</a> prefer roman forms that more closely mirror the script forms.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sitting here making script letters and other Cyrillic characters which are more difficult to write don&rsquo;t revert to a Latin form so why the de? And I disagree that a script double-bowl &lsquo;g&rsquo; is more work since I sign my name with one (easier than that convoluted thing they taught me in school) and the font I&rsquo;m working on already has that form for the Roman &lsquo;G&rsquo;.  And if easier is the reason why wouldn&rsquo;t the same apply to the upright? The Latin form is easier to write than the Cyrillic.</p>
<p><em>Take a look at any of ParaType’s script fonts and you’ll find the same things.</em></p>
<p>Yes, but why? That&rsquo;s what I want to know. Compare PT Betina Script with PT Birch &ndash; similar non joining scripts &ndash; and Betina uses the Latin &lsquo;D&rsquo; and Birch a Cyrillic. It would seem to make more sense to change to the Latin form for a flowing scirpt, but PT Adventure does several odd things: Teh (U0422) for instance, which is more complicated. Is the choice merely based historical precedence or what? Is there a rule of some sort?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Betina uses the Latin ‘D’ and Birch a Cyrillic</em></p>
<p>They are both cyrillic, just as two different script shapes of d are. Betina&rsquo;s designer (Alexander Tarbeev) made the upper &ldquo;serif&rdquo; of D longer and tilted the vertical stem slightly to the right so it resembles a traditional cyrillic script D, but can also work as latin D (for which these features are acceptable but not critical). Why use the same shape for both, while it was easier to make two different ones? I guess some people like a challenge.</p>
<p>Birch&rsquo;s uppercase, strictly speaking, is not a script alphabet - it has no specific script forms. Its D is a &ldquo;printed&rdquo; shape made with multiple strokes and no circular motion, while script D is made with one stroke - down/left and counterclockwise.</p>

<p>My mistake, you&rsquo;re right. I have to plead brain-fade here. I was thinking of something else entirely. Sorry.</p>
<p>I use the lower case single-bowl &lsquo;g&rsquo; for uppercase but loop the descender back to make the lower bowl. Sort of like Galliard italic lc &lsquo;g&rsquo; but rounder.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it, and I love it. Its concept is somewhat similar to Karen Cheng&rsquo;s book, but Gordon analyzes each Cyrillic letter one-by-one in different styles, and he also includes samples from various Russian logos and calligraphic creations. This gives you a very fair overview of the extent to which you can experiment with Cyrillic forms while staying within the boundaries of what the Russian reader considers &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. You can order the book at:

<p>Thanks Adam, I&rsquo;ve been looking for an ABCDerium for Cyrillic and couldn&rsquo;t find anything. This looks like it will be of great help.</p>
<p>Do you also know of any good paleographies for Cyrillic that are in English? Everything I&rsquo;ve located is either in Russian or Bulgarian.</p>
<p>P.S. Just went to order it and the shipping is more than the book. $78 vs. $53. Anywhere closer that I might find it?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get a sense of the underlying design principles and appropriateness for these alternate characters. When is the uppercase deh not like a deh?
