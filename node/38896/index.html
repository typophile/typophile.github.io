<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm looking for opinions and/or rules about the use of small caps. In this example, the IIIrd and M.D. folowing the first name.

<div class=commentbody>I would be more concerned with the linespacing ('leading') of this item…
And a better Script would improve this piece a lot.

<div class=commentbody>...and the letterspacing of everything in uppercase, most notable is the word AWARD. There seems to be (or was) an uncomfortable trend to tighten characters, when in fact everything set in all caps should be loosened. In other words, don't tighten the WA, loosen up the rest. Loosen is a funny word.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the comments. The whole design is very loooose at this point, but I am tracking the caps at a setting of 10.
Bert, could you be more specific about what you don't like about the leading? I keep reworking the baseline grid but am fielding a continual stream of size and leading changes that are ongoing so I suspect it will all be reworked a few more times.
And please do feel free to comment about the small caps as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Aside from the kerning issue--which should be dealt with--a more important one is to show a more clear hierarchy. Everything being close to the same size and color makes it less accessible and compelling. I would say: decide on three things that are most important, and make these bigger, and make the others help in a subordinate role. Then the subordinate ones you can play with your typographic tool kit to get the right balance.
For example, the treatment of 'save the date' doesn't seem to have the right emotional tone. It is surrounded with something flowery, and in the same script as the name of the dinner. The emotional appeal should be in the title, I would think, and "save the date" maybe tacked on in a bold sans, maybe asymmetrically or at an angle as a matter of fact advisory. Then the later notice can be the same design without the 'save the date' notice. </div>

Thanks for the input—I'm kind of torn because at full size the IIIrd plus the M.D. feels very weighty. By the time we get to the progam there will be more text laden with acronyms.
William, I'm still in the phase of following the client's request on size and emphasis where I need to comply first then seduce them into something better. In my mind the date needs to be prominent as it is the primary piece of information, yet the style is to minimize this. The client wants the receipients' names large—as large as the name of the event. So I'll continue to work with it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you will find that if you set the type just a bit smaller, you can accommodate much of the advice (good stuff) you've been given. The size of space is every bit as important as the size of the type.
If you use the natural, unkerned space between, say, "R" and "Y" as the proper amount, then "kern" everything else (looser) to match that spacing, you'll be on a good track.
One general use of small caps is to not visually break up a line of type with so many full caps. But when each word begins with a cap (as with a name), you have already broken the line -- or, if you prefer, established a new rhythm. Personally, I would set the "III" in full caps, and that will mean that M.D. too should be in full caps.
FWIW</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK. I'm getting feedback on more issues so I'll work with it. Here's an updated version that is not a screen dump and is actual size, which may help. Comment on anything you see. Note that I would like to keep the nifty Th lig., which will separate beyond a positive 22 tracking where it is now. Thanks again for the thoughts. This still isn't kerned, and I'm still mulling some of the more general comments.

<div class=commentbody>Jumping in late - I don't think the date and time should be the same font/size as their names. I'd treat the date/time typographically differently.
I realize "All Saints Health Foundation" is also the same treatment but since it's separated it's less confusing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Perfect Florian. I have done what you have also done previously. This new client does not have any set style. I had checked Chicago but my wife has the most recent edition at work, and also Bringhurst, as was discussed in the thread. I think removing the periods will take some of the emphasis off the degree.
Thanks all.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Bert, could you be more specific about what you don’t like about the leading?</cite>
Close your eyes. That's the advice my teachers gave me. Not completely, but just enough to peer through your lashes. Single letters, words and lines dissolve into cloudlike shapes. That will allow you to consider the allover colour of the piece. And you'll be able to see where blocks of matter are uneven or too close to each other. It even helps to hold the piece upsidedown.
BTW: It's almost impossible to review something on screen. I would need a highres print.
