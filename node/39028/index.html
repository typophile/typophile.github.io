Hi. This is a logo for a church. It's a young pentacostal church founded four years ago and consist of students and young families, mainly aged 25-30 years. They strive hard to not grow older - thus the logo is aiming a bit lower.

<strong>Brief:</strong>
Øystein: "Strong, but still nice and caring. You know, like my two meter tall grandfather with the worlds kindest eyes".
Per Olav: "It should maybe express fellowship?"
Øystein: "Hey, be creative!"
Per Olav: "Yeah. We don't really want our people to love it at first. We want to get responses like 'this is really challenging me' from the church."
Øystein: *grin*

<strong>Some of my thoughts:</strong>
Church identities have a long tradition of graphic misery.
It should not try to say "everything" (with crosses, doves, hands and perhaps some architechtual drawings filtered into each other).
It needs to be a bit tough.
It has to be very simple.

I'm presenting it tomorrow.
Shoot! </div>

Miss Tiff: The not-so-perfectly-aligned-circles crossed my mind to.

Concerning my justification for the "target":
A church is obviously aiming somewhere, and I felt it was a good symbol.

Perhaps a change of colour could do the trick. The black is very "shooting target".

Here's some background on the symbol, by the way.
http://www.carantha.net/carantania.htm
(scroll down to "The Point in the Circle")
It's kinda interesting, in a historical perspective.

Seriously though, I think the top one in your last post is good. I'd like to see a rougher version (more like the picture from your example) for comparison. Also, the outline around the circle might need to be a bit thicker (or the dot smaller).

Joachim - maybe you're seeing breasts everywhere because you're from a city of boobs :-P

They loved the logo, and even read more symbolism into it. (Rings in water etc.) They have to run it through a few people though, so I'm not sure what it will come to yet.</div>

Seriously though, wouldn't the "negative of the original symbol" be a bit like an inverted cross? You might be aiming for a different sort of target there.</div>

Which came first, the chicken or the egg. Turns out it was the egg. Possibly god is a sign for the sun? The Egyptians used the symbol first, and well used the concept of monotheism. Typically the christians are not so quick to highlight their models, but hey, I like it.</div>

Maybe make the stroke of the outer circle the size of the radius of the inner circle. The outer circle makes me feel like it doesn't belong there.

Here's an example of what I mean...

		<div class="commentbody">Part of the problem with abstract designs is the average person will try to make the symbol into something they have related to in the past. The early remarks, like target, and dart board are valid. You might want to go a different direction rethink the concept. Sometimes I hook onto an idea and fight with it, put it away, and when I come back to it later realize I was forcing the issue. You might be forcing the issue. My advice is to put it away and revisit it after a long walk.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi. The thread is sort of old and the logo is out already, so I can't change it. I'm thankful for the comments though, as I'm learning a lot! Keep 'em coming.

I'm still a young designer in the middle of exploration. Currently I'm developing their visual identity, which spans a lot more than the logo. When the puzzle starts adding up I might post some samples.
I agree the logo could be stronger, but keep in mind the extremely low quality and conservative symbolism of similar identities. 

In the church the logo is used as:

1: A small mono symbol in the lower right corner, or centered at the bottom.

2: A large filled decorative shape. (Images, ink drawings, metallic inks, colours).</div>
