  body: "Florian,\r\n\r\nImages and files may appear missing because the site is still
    caching. This could take up to a full day or more.\r\n\r\nThis maintenance was
    not for fixing bugs or addressing feature issues - and yes we are aware of the
    problems you listed above and are working towards solutions. We were simply upgrading
    to a faster server - which was supposed to take 30 minutes but our lovely friends
    at MediaTemple decided it should take much, much longer.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    really \u2013 long downtime raised false expectations. \r\n;-)\r\nGood to know
    that the missing images will reappear.\r\nAnd a faster server? That\u2019s great
    news! Thanks,\r\nF"

  body: "What's with messing with the URL structure? It appears that the /cms/ thing
    is perhaps a staging area? I hope so, because if you thought that your Google
    indexing was bad before, wait until your entire site is de-indexed. Automated
    302 redirects are helpful, and if the move is permanent, full 301 redirects are
    essential.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, if the /cms/ change isn't a staging area for
    the server transfers, it's a poor URL design structure that does little to help
    the end user. A URL re-write could be used to make things more user, and SEO,
    friendly.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts, in any case. Take them for what you will."
