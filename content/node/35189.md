  \"Goldenbook\"...\r\nIt is for display..but I would like to find something for text
  as well.\r\n\r\nOr just cool typefaces circa that era that I should check out. This
  is for a magazine redesign in Boston.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMia"

    for since Goldenbook is better for display.\r\nLove ITC Golden Cockerel, so perfect.\r\n\r\nHeller's
    book is great. I don't have that copy. Will have to ebay it.\r\n\r\nWhat other
    faces do you guys think would look good for a type family?\r\nThinking Old Newspaper
    faces as well.\r\n\r\nBTW, the best thing about this Harry Potter was the newspaper
    design!\r\n"

    open to turn of the century to 1930's. Heavy black Egyptians to Thins like \"Goldenbook\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you want to do this properly, acquire some magazines from that era at
    old paper stores/markets, and a copy of \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth
    Century\" by Matt McGrew (Oak Knoll), which will enable you to identify the faces.
    You'll find that the 20s and 30s were radically different -- going from illustration
    and historicism to photography and modernism. Knockout and Belizio are 19th century
    styles.\r\n\r\nBroadway (Inline) is one of the most Art Deco faces, so is Radiant,
    which has a useful condensed. Bernhard Gothic and Kabel are more deco than Futura.
    Deco slabs (Stymie, Rockwell) are very different from the Egyptians -- round curves
    and not much stroke contrast. See Keith Tam's essay on this at Type Culture.com.
    Bodonis -- especially the dark weights -- were exemplary Deco faces."

    and movingtowards the 20's and 30's...\r\nNIck, thanks for all the amazing advice.
    I'm going to get the McGrew book right away.\r\n\r\nI have Bernhard Gothic and
    love Futura. Have Rockwell but enjoy Egyptians much more.\r\n\r\nBeen collecting
    samples on Ebay. Other than Gallagher's in New York, do you know of other vintage
    paper collectible resources?\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMia"

  body: "Some comic book stores also have old magazines.\r\nMost \"collector\" flea
    markets have stalls with magazine traders and dealers.\r\nIn Toronto, there is
    a twice-yearly \"Old Paper Show and Sale\", as well as an \"Old Book\" show, where
    some of the dealers have magazines, so I would imagine there is something similar
    in your neck of the woods.\r\nDealers who specialize in antique/vintage photos,
    postcards, movie posters, money, maps etc. often take out booths/stalls in such
    shows, so ask them when and where they show. \r\nAFAIK, trading on eBay has lessened
    the necessity for dealers to have stores, but they still find shows are useful.\r\nGoogle
    \"paper ephemera flea market\". Good luck!"
