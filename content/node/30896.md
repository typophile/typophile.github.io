    metal one made by Claude Garamond himself, back in the mid-1500s.\r\n\r\nNow if
    you're looking for a digital version of it, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1737.html\">Garamond
    Premier Pro</a> is by far the best revival of it, in my opinion."

  body: Although some would argue that the typeface <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/1530-garamond/">1530
    Garamond</a> by Tiro is a very good version of the "original".
