  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Six weeks away from graduation, and I am redoing yet another résumé. I have really focused a lot on typography through my studies, and am planning on furthering my education into grad school. Essentially, I do need this to look good, and be typeset well. Below are the specifications and the details about the design.</p>
<p>Size= 7.25 x 10.25
Typeface Indetification-
Name and Footer= Meridien Roman
All other= Kepler</p>
<p>My main concerns are:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the hierarchy is clear, easy to follow, and understandable.</li>
<li>It has been brought to my attention that I have used a category to seperate my &ldquo;Technical Qualifications&rdquo;, where as I have not included categories for &ldquo;Education&rdquo; and &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; for it would ruin my hierarchy. It is my opinion that these two categories are not needed, as the first two things on a résumé are typically your education and your previous experience. The question of flow is really the one posed, as some seem to feel that this omission causes an interruption.</li>
<li>I have utilized small caps in the sentence fragements where necessary, however, the term &ldquo;OSX&rdquo; baffles me. Should this be set in standard magiscules, or do they cause an interruption in the typography?</li>
<li>At this point, I have not yet decided how exactly I am going to orient the text block on the page, wether it be justified left with a larger right margin, centered, or what have you. If you have an opinion on this as well, I am more than open to hearing what you have to say.</li>
</ol>
<p>I really appreciate any suggestions and criticism, and the harsher the better. A dilutted opinion is one less valueable to my goal. Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my opinion, as far as I can gather from a quick glance.</p>
<p><strong>Dash issues:</strong>
I’d question your use of n-dashes instead of hyphens in your body text;
I’d also question your use of n-dashes instead of m-dashes in your dates.</p>
<p>I have neither Meridien nor Kepler. Their respective hyphens may be longer than usual (it seems so), nevertheless I’d use m-dashes for your dates.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar issues:</strong>
I’d question your omission of full-stops (periods to the American English folk).
I’d hyphenate the words “print” and “based” to read “print-based”.
Things are “comprised of” other things.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have always been told that n-dashes are preferred, as opposed to a standard hyphen. An m-dash does seem rather obtrusive in length for the use in dates, at least with Kepler. I suppose I could just substitute a glyph from one of the condensed weights to remedy this however. Perhaps you can recommend a font that has well proportioned m and n-dashes that I could view to gain a better understanding of just what a well proportioned dash should look like, width wise.</p>
<p>I also avoided periods upon another recommendation. I felt, as others did, that since I have avoided using complete senteces, that puntuation was not necessary. Additionally, I chose the word &ldquo;comprise&rdquo; based on the recommendation of Strunk and White. Their definition relates that this term literally translates to &ldquo;embrace&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t mind changing the word though, it is really not a big loss either way, although I would prefer to correct it so that I position the writing to affect the middle 80% of the population whom have the average understanding of grammar and spelling. This seems to be the best tactic, as the bottom 10% and the top 10% of designers are clearly not where I am aiming as of just yet, being not a seasoned designer myself.</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions, they are appreciated.</p>

<p>Also, I would try to avoid justifying the right margin.  Iam a wrong. Someone prove me wrong. Ive been working on my resume lately but I think there are standards you are trying to break.  I feel your contact info is tucked at the bottom and hidden. And over all the design is to grey.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong but based on my research this is how I feel. You definately are great at typography and iam impressed overall. I will post mine if you like. Maybe I should shut up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No, don&rsquo;t do that mad_grab. I have had some many different résumé&rsquo;s at this point, so, its not like I don&rsquo;t understand where you are coming from. I did not really set out to break any standards, and I typically do prefer to set well proportioned, fully justified text than to have ragged, unbalanced lines of type. I do do both, but on this occasion, I felt it better to keep it simple, the old KISS principle. The lack of character might be bad, but really, I aimed at again,  easy readability. I was surprised to hear Prakash Nair comment on the length, as its far shorter than any other résumé I have done in the past, its not even on a full 8.5 x 11 sheet. Also, I should point out that the character comes through the paper based on the stock that I have chosen to print with. I ran across it really on accident, its a laid text weight from Neenah, that is actually a light blue, you can view a sample <a href="http://www.neenahpaper.com/itemlisting/index.asp?ft=Home&s=Laidc&b=05&c=CBL">here</a>. I think that this lends enough character, plus the odd size, to set me apart.</p>
<p>I agreed although about my name and contact info, I will make those items more prominent. After all, those are rather important items of information.</p>

Medium singular, media plural
Strikes me as having too many adjectives and I get the feeling that they are there to make the line lengths.
I don&rsquo;t mean to be harsh, but it is worth considering these things</p>
<p>It is worth indicating the generation of software, and making a brief self-introduction to a potential employer, for example marital status, driving licence, home address etc.
Good luck with the job hunt.
