  body: "Does not match heisei maru gothic but might be in another Japanese font.\r\nClosest
    I have found would be AG Book Rounded at a weight between Light and Regular  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGBookRoundedLightInUse_4075.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGBookRoundedRegularInUse_5982.gif]

    a full match because the mid stroke of _3_ is too short.\r\nDon"

    body: "helvetica rounded came out in 1978, this record is from 1976. \r\nalso
      i can only find examples of helvetica rounded in bold. -- in the link you gave
      me, the 9 is much too thick . it could very much be helvetica but im just not
      finding any regular (non bold) versions! could you help me out and post an example? "
