  before I continue. It'll be obvious that I'm looking at the forms of Franklin Gothic
  for cues. Every now and then I feel like it's not original enough. So I ask you,
  trained experts \u2014 is this too similar to Franklin Gothic? In the end, I hope
  for it to be a strong but friendly and soft, grotesque face. I'm thinking it'll
  have more personality once I get to the bold/black weights. Should I just jump to
  those instead and neutralize the unique features for the text weights?"

  body: "A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure the slanted crossbar of e is working
    in this grotesque face.\r\n- Where rounded forms merge into straight stems, I
    think the combination of the thinned stroke and the ink-trap like cut are too
    strong - they seem to sever the rounded stroke. (I wonder if the \"inktrap\" should
    bite a bit into the straight stroke as well?)\r\n- Shouldn't bottom of b angle
    away from bowl (compare a and d)?\r\n- Leftmost stroke of A is too thin. \r\n-
    Round dots of 'i' with square period is a bit weird to my eye.\r\n- Your space
    character may be too wide, making the font's function in running text more difficult
    to gauge. "

  body: "Thanks for the comments, eliason. I really want to make the slanted crossbar
    of e to work. It gives an almost casual feel the whole face. Any ideas on how
    to work on that? I'll definitely take a look at the convergence of round to straight.
    It was my goal for it to have a smooth, monolinear quality, it's important not
    to sever the strokes. The W is bothering me, too but I can't seem to find good
    examples of that shape. Any recommendations would help. \r\n"

  body: "Maybe <em>more</em> slant on the e crossbar would work, then - so it's clearly
    a design feature rather than a misprinted letter. Look at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-kabel/|Kabel]]'s
    e (the first example of a sans with such a feature than comes to my mind) - a
    much more assertive angle.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else will weigh in on suggestions
    for the W - I agree it needs work."
