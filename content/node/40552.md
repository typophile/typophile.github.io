body: "Is there a way to restore a kerning exception so it again follows the key glyph
  in the class in FontLab? Can't find it... and I need it bad. I can only Reset the
  kerning.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "A single value?\r\n\r\nOpen the kerning list in the Kerning Panel (second
    buttom from the right in the panel's toolbar).\r\nNavigate to the exception pair.
    Alternatively, type the pair into the preview part of the panel and click on the
    right glyph of the pair; this will highlight the pair in the kerning list.\r\nClick
    on this kerning pair's line in the kerning list; do this even if it is highlighted
    already!\r\nIn OSX, hit the 'back' key. In Windows it might be the 'delete' key,
    I don't know.\r\n"

  body: "It's <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/downloads/KLTF-KerningTools.zip\">here</a>,
    \"Remove Exception Kerning\". It is important that you open the script in a text
    editor first and assign your own identifier tags which identify your classes as
    leftside, rightside (and exception). Else the script won't work. Also see the
    notes in the text file. Not tested much, so better try with a copy of the font
    first.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nKerning pairs of which one glyph is not covered in
    any class at all are <em>not</em> considered exception kerning pairs!\r\n"

    I go ahead and try it. Many thanks.\r\n\r\nInteresting that FontLab doesnt have
    this feature in built in the program, btw. I think it should be there."

  body: A bit late, but in version 5.1.3 it appears you can right-click on a glyph(pair)
    in the Metrics window (in kerning mode) and reset kerning from this menu. Then
    you can choose the range on which to apply it.
