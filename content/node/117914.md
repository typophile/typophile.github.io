  if you were to choose a typeface for a novel in the creepy genre, what would you
  use? There are elements of fantasy in the storytelling, but also quite some chill
  factor in the creepy sense.\r\n\r\nMy feeling was going towards something with edgy
  serifs, higher contrast, nothing rounded at least. It should be comfortable to read,
  yet leave an unsettling hint? Walbaum, perhaps?"

    used it some months ago for setting a poem about the Spanish Civil War, and IMHO
    it works great."

    maybe a bit more in-your-face scary; or perhaps something more organic with a
    slightly unusual/unsettling tension \u2013 Satyr was my first thought (especially
    since you say fantasy too). https://monokrom.no/fonts/satyr \r\nI guess it depends
    whether it\u2019s psychological creeping-under-your-skin uncanniness (\u201Csomething\u2019s
    not quite right here\u201D) that you\u2019re going for, or a more blatant scary
    vibe \xE0 la people walking through an empty castle waiting to be impaled by barely
    concealed spikes sticking out of every surface. :)"

  body: "Preissig is a bit in-your-face as nina says but I think Christobal is on
    the right track. Many of Frantisek Storm's typefaces have a special weirdness
    that could work well in such a case.\r\nYou already mentioned Walbaum, which is
    a excellent choice but there are stranger beasts among Storm's typefaces. "

    with its edges but the Storm foundry has some other good ones, [[http://www.stormtype.com/family-lexon-gothic.html|Lexon
    Gothic]] or [[http://www.stormtype.com/family-trivia-humanist.html|Trivia]] perhaps?
    I guess I'll have to print a page or two to see how they perform for reading text.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I agree, I love Satyr since I looked at it a few months ago..."

    time.  One example is <a href=\"http://myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/coldstyle/\">Coldstyle</a>,

    well for me as a text font.  The regular weight is quite light, which may be in
    line with a notion of creepy silence and shrinking because of fear."

    types that were used to set H. P. Lovecraft's original books. There's a whole
    [[http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/propdocs/propfonts.html|website]] dedicated
    to that but nothing that tickles me the right way. However, the handwriting might
    be nice to use maybe as a title face, or if there's a letter in the text, or some
    such."

  body: "My vote is for  ITC Veljovic -- Joshua says he read a book set in it -- because
    it's not going to be too distracting to the reader who wants to get through a
    novel without being constantly hit in the face by details of the font, while at
    the same time it has an effective haunting emaciated thorny look. In my opinion
    it works for extended text because it is is not a high contrast font. Leaving
    aside the sharp details, the light weight and low contrast is very similar to
    the Victorian Lightface text fonts that were condemned from the 1890s onward as
    being too wispy -- which might we might freely interpret as lacking the vigor
    of life in the flesh.\r\nAs for the Lovecraft fonts, note that they were created
    as \"prop fonts\" that work well in a prop document seen on screen, but would
    be technically inadequate for a book. \r\nDon"

    a good sign that the reader will be able to quickly scan the content without distraction.
    Just an opinion, but I would do it if I was trying an unusual font.\r\nDon\r\n"

    see some people have named sharp typefaces which I don't think I would've picked,
    but if you want a bit murky yet sharp then Mokka may appeal to you: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/mokka/\r\n\r\nLexicon
    I would also consider murky yet sharp and Trinit\xE9 is particularly dark. Expensive
    but it may be a viable option.\r\n\r\nI also have to think of Tribute. It doesn't
    feature bold but if you're setting a novel you may not need it. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/tribute-ot/\r\n\r\nSatyr
    is very dark to me; perhaps a bit too dark. Alegreya seems to be somewhat in the

    be interesting to set a similar length passage in Dez Petranian, and put it to
