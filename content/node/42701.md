  body: I dn't think this is a font. It looks like someone took something like a Trade
    Gothic Bold - condensed it and then had fun in photoshop. Though the Es look similar
    because of the inverted V hunk removed - they aren't the same... also true of
    the Is - even the erosion of the Vs are different.

    one captured against black only:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ve2_6250.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    not in dafont, either..."

  body: "Your cleaned up version certainly seems to indicate a grunge font was used,
    and not something messed up afterwards. I'm not sure how to account for the apparent
    variation in the I's, but they are basically altered in similar ways, with that
    large chunk out of the lower left edge. \r\n\r\nI know you checked Dafont, but
    of course they can't have every grunge font. I would guess making a custom grunge
    font isn't too hard (judging from how many of them there are). There are plenty
    in the commercial font world too -- have you checked some of the large collections
    that let you search with keywords? \r\n\r\nI just did that at MyFonts and what
    do you know? [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/damaged-guts/|Damaged Guts]]
    from Pizza Dude matches it exactly, if you squoosh\u2122 it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Spiffy, thanks Mike. I did look through MyFonts to some extent but may have
    been hung up on finding a condensed font.

  body: "Glad to help. I always try to look for the 'earmarks' of the lettering, rather
    than the width, or weight, because those can always be tweaked with graphics programs
    (and often are, sometimes to ill effect).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
