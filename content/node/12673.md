body: Can someone ID this font. It has qualities/details similar to Arial, Abadi and
  Futura. None match all the fonts - maybe a cheap imitation or can someone direct
  me to the correct font

    body: "i guess it is a mix of Arial Black and Futura Extra Bold Condensed. Gill

  body: Ach no, I think the caps are Futura. It's not easy to identify when it's horibly

  body: That's what threw me off as well -- the caps are from a different font than
    the lowercase.
