  something more exciting! With the age old problem of keeping typographic consistency
  within a large organisation (2000+ staff) I wanted to know: is it feasible for us
  to get slightly different cuts of dax/trade gothic done which we can rename and
  roll-out to all computers in our organisation for letters, presentations etc, rather
  than paying for a 2000 user license? if so, how much does a font have to be changed
  before you can own it in that way, and how much time/cost is it likely to incurr?\r\n\r\nReally
  just wanted to hear from a professional whether they thought this is the best way
  to go on this issue?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nOwen\r\n"

    money! And establish a unique (or at least distinct) visual identity in the process.
    On the other hand, getting a (legal) derivative of a \"famous\" font won't achieve
    that since the owner of the original typically wouldn't want to <em>lose</em>
    money. So the way to do it is find a modest but capable type designer to make
    a new font close to a style that you'd like. But yes, not <em>uncomfortably</em>
    close... lest you make the mistake that UPS did.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    don\u2019t know of any commercial type EULA that allows a user to change the typeface
    and redistribute it to users who do not have a license. What you want to do is
    very unethical and will likely make you the target of an expensive lawsuit. You
    should really pass this issue on to someone with a stronger moral compass."

    think a more probable use case for 2000 users would be a \xBBBasic Set\xAB of
    four style-linked fonts: <a href=\"for http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_dax_offc_basic_set/\">Dax
    Offc Basic Set</a> (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic), for which the 5-user
    license is $142 (~ $28.40 per user).\r\n\r\nA 1000 user license for the Basic
    Set is $3124 (~ $3.12 per user; for 2000 users you would have to ask for a quote)
    at fontshop.com.\r\n\r\nBut I agree, if you need more than these few styles, and
    can spend some more money, why not have somebody draw something unique that fits
    your company better."

  body: Haven't any of you guys ever heard of a site license? I'd see what FF would
    consider reasonable for one. Usually (according to a Spiekermann lecture I attended),
    a site license also allows for modifications, but you'd have to confirm that.

    I don't know if they carry the fonts you're looking for....\r\n\r\nBut in that
    case, you'd be paying more, not less; both paying for the original fonts and for
    the modifications.\r\n\r\nFurther, from some research I did about a year ago,
    given the prices cited above for the license fees for the existing typeface, and
    assuming you want a four-member (or more) family, you won't likely touch that
    for a new design of even vaguely comparable quality from an experienced type designer
    \ .\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "As Ray mentions, many of the larger foundries customize their own typefaces
    and type families all the time. As far as I am aware, the process is typically
    two-fold. First, the customer licenses the number of font weights for the number
    of seats that they want. Then, the font files are modified according to the customer's
    design wishes, and the fonts are also occasionally renamed. These edited files
    are the fonts that the customer uses (they use the fonts on to the number of seats
    they purchased licenses for).\r\n\r\nThe total fee (at least for the typefaces
    you mentioned) is likely less than what a custom, brand-new, from scratch, family
    of comparable quality would run at an outside designer or firm. "
