  body: 'Whaddya think I&#39;ve been doing for the last, uh, far too long? <BR> <BR>If
    there&#39;s a free font out there called &#34;Lightning&#34; or &#34;Electric&#34;
    or something similar that looks like this, I didn&#39;t find it. There are a bunch
    of free &#34;Harry Potter&#34; lookalike fonts, though they don&#39;t look cartoonish
    like this. <BR> <BR>The sample here looks like the stroke widths vary in such
    a way as to make it look not digital to me. <BR> <BR>And Kyle: I totally believe
    it. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Gosh, also koeiekat does&#39;t know. But it is a scan so your customer should
    be able to give you some more info. The whole feature around this may give a clue.
    i do not really like the thing but it is an interesting question. <BR> <BR>Have
    fun ... and be nice to the cats <BR>
