  What exactly are the limitations on the <i>usage</i> of these font files? Can I
  use them for whatever I want as long as they stay on the computer where I installed
  Adobe Reader?\r\n\r\n(No, I'm not going to read any EULAs.)"

    files (with the included fonts) <em>programmatically interface</em> with the Adobe
    Reader?\r\n\r\nBy the way: Did someone compare the included fonts with their commercial
    counterparts? I remember that one version of the Microsoft Reader came with Frutiger
    but this included font had a very bad kerning (if at all) so it was quite useless
    outside this application.\r\n\r\nGunther\r\n\r\n"

  body: The mumbo-jumbo you quote is why cannot be bothered with EULAs. I take it
    for granted no modification is allowed, but I don't consider that usage so it
    doesn't matter in this case. I want to know whether I can publish a book using
    the included fonts, for example. Is anyone going to stop me?

  body: "This business of high quality fonts bundled with Acrobat Reader 7.0 has set
    me wondering. I do not like mumbo-jumbo any more than Sergej, but I thought it
    worth a look, in case it is OK to use the bundled fonts in the normal way.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I first installed Acrobat Reader 7.0 on Linux, it was a pre-release version or
    something, available on an Adobe ftp site, but not through their usual download
    area. This version had a short license agreement about the fonts, as below:\r\n<cite>\r\nThe
    font software contained in this package is being licensed to you solely\r\nfor
    use with the Adobe Acrobat Reader product (\"Acrobat Reader\") subject to\r\nthe
    terms and conditions of the Electronic End User License Agreement\r\naccompanying
    the Acrobat Reader.\r\n</cite>\r\nI assumed from this that you are not allowed
    to use the fonts in any other application, so I did not make them accessible to
    my other applications. I did not read the main EULA.\r\n\r\nSince the first install,
    my Linux distribution has packaged Acrobat Reader 7.0, and I am now using the
    packaged version. I looked for the font license, to post it here, but I could
    not find it. I had an old system with the original Acrobat installation on it,
    and copied the license stuff from there. Having read the old EULA, it looked as
    if it was OK to distrubute the fonts to others by embedding. You could also distribute
    the fonts to, say, a print company, provided they have a valid license for the
    fonts. These are the clauses about the fonts:\r\n<cite>\r\n2.6. Font Software.
    If the Software includes font software - \r\n2.6.1. You may Use the font software
    as described above on the Permitted Number\r\nof computers and output such font
    software on any output devices connected to\r\nsuch computers. \r\n2.6.2. If the
    Permitted Number of computers is five or fewer, you may download\r\nthe font software
    to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of one output device\r\nconnected to at least
    one of such computers for the purpose of having such font\r\nsoftware remain resident
    in the output device, and of one additional such\r\noutput device for every multiple
    of five represented by the Permitted Number of\r\ncomputers. \r\n2.6.3. You may
    take a copy of the font(s) you have used for a particular file\r\nto a commercial
    printer or other service bureau, and such service bureau may\r\nUse the font(s)
    to process your file, provided such service bureau has a valid\r\nlicense to Use
    that particular font software. \r\n2.6.4. You may convert and install the font
    software into another format for\r\nuse in other environments, subject to the
    following conditions: A computer on\r\nwhich the converted font software is used
    or installed shall be considered as\r\none of your Permitted Number of computers.
    Use of the font software you have\r\nconverted shall be pursuant to all the terms
    and conditions of this Agreement.\r\nSuch converted font software may be used
    only for your own customary internal\r\nbusiness or personal use and may not be
    distributed or transferred for any\r\npurpose, except in accordance with the Transfer
    section below. \r\n2.6.5 You may embed the font software, or outlines of the font
    software, into\r\nyour electronic documents to the extent that the font vendor
    copyright owner\r\nallows for such embedding. The fonts contained in this package
    may contain both\r\nAdobe and non-Adobe owned fonts. You may fully embed any font
    owned by Adobe.\r\nRefer to the font sample sheet or font information file to
    determine font\r\nownership. See the Documentation for location and information
    on how to access\r\nthese sheets and files.\r\n</cite>\r\nThis appears much more
    permissive than I had assumed.\r\n\r\nThe new EULA says very little about the
    fonts. They are mentioned in the list of stuff that constitutes the Software,
    but there are no specific clauses about embedding, printing, etc. The only bits
    that look relevant say:\r\n<cite>\r\n...\"Use\" or \"Using\" means to access,
    install, download, copy or otherwise benefit from using the functionality of the
    Software in accordance with the Documentation.\r\n...\r\n2. Software License.
    As long as you comply with the terms of this Software License Agreement (this
    \"Agreement\"), Adobe grants to you a non-exclusive license to Use the Software
    for the purposes described in the Documentation.\r\n</cite>\r\nTrouble with this,
    I cannot find anything about the bundled fonts in the documentation, which I assume
    means the user manual available within Acrobat.\r\n\r\nAnybody know the score
    here? Is Adobe really giving away 8 fonts that would normally cost $35 a pop?\r\n\r\n"
