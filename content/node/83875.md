  contain a \"Ko\" or \"KO\" ligature (think Estilo)\r\n- or alternatively a font
  containing a nice swash K with an extended leg hugging an \"o\".\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    when I posted the above, but this line of thought isn't relevant to the project
    anymore. \r\n\r\nSo we can lay this post to rest."
