  typefaces printed in the 50's, i think, by Hazell, Watson and Viney. There's a sample
  page of Imprint. It looked nice \u2013 as in clean, solid, readable \u2013 so I
  bought the digital version. I know there are errors in translation with these things
  but it's nothing like the letterpress one; in set 'effect', I mean. It may be like
  it in form. \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest either i. a digital face that has a similar
  effect to the sample ( below, 'imprint' ), or ii. settings I could use to pull my
  digital Imprint ( see my 'experiment' screenshot ) toward the letterpress version.
  It seems to me that some digitised letterpress fonts are more faithful to the bits
  of metal, than they are to the inked, printed, effect. Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n"

    a bit darker on the page (ink spread?). You could tighten the tracking to fix
    the first attribute and add a fractional bit of stroke thickness to simulate the
    ink spread.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    version seems to have retained some of the sturdiness of metal.
