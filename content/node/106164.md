  body: "Well, we did have a thread here about a paper claiming that less-readable
    typography actually helped people understand what they were reading, because it
    forced them to slow down and think about it.\r\n\r\nWhich is probably why we don't
    deal much with the cognitive side of typography here. It's just to aesthetically
    depressing."
