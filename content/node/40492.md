body: I am on the lookout for a light, casual, feminine script. No crazy ascenders
  or descenders, flourishes or embellishments. Little to no slant. Perhaps with a
  handwritten, or even retro quality. Any ideas?

  body: Yes! The Charles Bluemleim collection I like. I have been a fan of Mrs. Blackfort
    for a while, but didn't know the designer. Lovely. Thanks for your help, everybody.
