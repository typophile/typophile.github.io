  but rather a perk for helping out a [[http://www.wnybookarts.org/|non-profit book
  arts center]] that I have spent the last 18 months working to build into a world-class
  facility for letterpress printing. The digital font is free if you become a member
  (memberships start at $25 for student rate) This is the only way to get a license
  for the font. I hope you will consider [[http://www.wnybookarts.org/joinus.php|becoming
  a member]] (plus you get additional swag... and letterpress print shop access if
  you happen to be in the Western New York Area. \r\n\r\nThe font in question is called
  [[http://www.wnybookarts.org/winchell.php|Winchell and the story of the font is
  here]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Winchellimage_3643.jpg]\r\n\r\nWe
  have hundreds of metal fonts, dozens of Woodtype fonts and over 100 Ludlow faces
  at the WNY Book Arts Center plus a library of type specimens and reference books.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for listening."
