  body: Doesn&#39;t seem like HTF Didot... <BR>There are some interesting features
    in this sample  <BR>&#40;wide E, small aperture on C, the K, etc&#41; that don&#39;t
    <BR>match Hoefler&#39;s faces. <BR>Anyway, I have no idea what it can be... I
    just did a <BR>quick MyFonts search and, nothing.

  body: Here is a sample of the same book that uses upper and lower cases. But I think
    thats not the same Didot of the &#34;Tamara&#34; advertising<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24150.jpg"

  body: I think that perhaps they slightly modified the letters. I&#39;ve not found
    an R that ends like that. Hoefler&#39;s Didots have a rounded bowl on the P as
    well. And their R is wider, as well as the comments made by Eduardo. <BR> <BR>This
    second sample looks more like Firmin Didot &#40;that ugly K gives it away&#41;.
    But the second line is not Firmin Didot. What a ball of worms.
