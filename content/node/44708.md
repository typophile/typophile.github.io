body: "the lack of recognition given to type designers is a significant issue.\r\n\r\nwords
  are seen and used every day but do we stop and realise who actually designed that
  particular typeface. should typographers go unnotice? \r\n\r\nBefore the digital
  age, typography was a specialised occupation, but now due to digitalization a new
  generation of typography has developed. any body can now design a typeface and put
  it on the web for people to use. should this be allowed ? and should the original
  type designers like john baskerville (baskerville) and giambattista bodoni (bodini)
  go unrecognised?\r\n\r\nplease comment or expand on this idea. doing a case study
  for university and need a variety of opinions.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    you do any other work on this project, you need to back that statement up with
    a lot more thought about why it\u2019s a significant issue.\r\n\r\nIf you think
    the purpose of most type is to be recognized, you\u2019re sorely mistaken. And
    recognizing the big names in type is pretty easy these days; a quick Google search
    brings up everything most people need to know, buying a book or two will explain
    a lot more. People have better things to do than keep track of who designed all
    of the important stuff in their lives, from type to computers to coffee cups.
    If everyone spent time worrying about designers, nothing else would ever get done."
