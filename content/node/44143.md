  is a discussion posted yesterday about the new Jason Smith (Fontsmith) font FS Mencap.
  Perhaps it is prematurely posted as there does not seem to include any visuals of
  the font and only contains information about it. As I find the actual visuals equally
  stimulating as the research behind the design I went searching for such with no
  luck. I tried Fontsmith.com, and Mencap.org with even less results than what was
  posted on the Microsoft site. If anyone has links to sites (with the glyphs/visuals)
  or were working on the project that would be greatly appreciated.\r\nI would like
  to learn more about similar fonts designed for people with learning disabilites
  such as dyslexia, etc... I heard of a font called Read and have read a bit about
  it a while back, as well as Clearview. Is there any other designs with as much research
  behind them that anyone knows, and links to such articles?\r\n\r\nOle"

  body: Involving readers in the design process is an interesting idea, and it bodes
    well that a top-notch, experienced type designer is producing this kind of typeface,
    rather than the usual neophytes.

  body: "As Nick says, it is good that there is a top-notch designer involved in this.
    My concern from the description is that they seemed to have asked group with disabilities
    their opinions rather than testing how well they read different fonts. \r\n\r\nI
    find that often people will say that a particular font is readable because it
    looks simple, like Helvetica, or because it looks good big in titles. But those
    qualities might not actually be more readable in text--it might be the opposite.
    The only way to know is not to ask people's opinions, but to actually comparatively
    test their reading speed and comprehension with different fonts."

    in our discussion \r\nif he has not already joined it by the end of the weekend.

  body: "The subject line of this thread is unhelpfully vague. If I\u2019m totally
    blind, do I need a special typeface? If I\u2019m missing a toe?\r\n\r\nIn any
    event, I have read all the claims about typefaces allegedly more compatible with
    dyslexia and learning disability and they\u2019re all nonsense, as are the fonts
    themselves. There are a number of very high thresholds to overcome here:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Typeface
    must be recognizable as an actual professionally-designed typeface. We may now
    know what that means, but given the finished font, we know when it <em>didn\u2019t</em>
    happen.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nTypeface must work better than rationally-chosen existing
    fonts in user testing. This tends to be completely screwed up (Cf. Tiresias) and
    is hard to measure in any case (where \u201Chard\u201D simply means \u201Cexpensive
    and involved\u201D).\r\n</li><li>Entire project must conquer the hurdle that nobody
    but the commissioning organization is ever, at any time, going to use the resulting
    typeface. What are LD readers gonna do then? \r\n</li></ul>\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe

    to use the resulting typeface. </em>\r\n\r\nLet's see what the font looks like
    before assuming that.\r\n\r\nHowever, for a name with mass appeal, Mencap might
    not be as good as something involving the word \"schoolbook\", which has a pretty
    good reputation in type circles. So the organization would have to supress some
    of its branding in having a typeface named after itself, and accept that there
    would be some resistance against using a face named Mencap in general publishing
    not specifically targeting those with disabilities, and choose a disingenuous
    name instead. But that may not be an issue in light of the role played by the
    UK government and that country's overbearing bureaucracy, which could result in
    a growing demand for faces such as this, in the public sphere."

  body: "I used Google to find the FontSmith site, and the face is visible there.
    It looks like a fairly conventional sans-serif face.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough,
    both the lower and upper case letters K have first one arm coming from the vertical
    bar, and then the second arm coming from the first arm. This may gladden the heart
    of another poster here who has a recent thread."
