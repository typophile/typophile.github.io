body: At the end of Wheel of Fortune this evening, Pat and Vanna were talking about
  their favorite fonts and Vanna said she uses Arial and Helvetica. Ok, so I am slightly
  embarrassed to admit that I was watching The Wheel, but it is worth public ridicule
  to bring this to the attention of typophiles everywhere.

    \ Vanna is still foxy after all these years, too.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't know
    what the deal with her using Arial is.  Maybe when she doesn't have Helvetica
    close by and handy?"

    as you are wearing it.

    a pre-primetime delight. What's not to love? Giant letters, all lit up... Yum.

    a good sign. \r\n\r\nMaybe she saw Gary\u2019s movie..."

  body: The Wheel was so much better before The Pat Sajak Show. Anyone care to field
    the chronology of typefaces used on the game board over the years?

    some serious <em>Wheel</em> viewing!  :-)\r\n\r\nI didn't realize it until now,
    but I saw your presentation at the New York TypeCon in 2005. Nice to see you here
    on Typophile."
