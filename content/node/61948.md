  handling in OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard]]. There are a few changes in this OS that I
  don't quite understand. Maybe someone can shed a light on these?\r\n\r\nAccording
  to Apple Snow Leopard is mainly an optimized, cleaned up version of OS X. Its goal
  is not to add tons of new features but rather improve what was already there.\r\n\r\nWith
  this in mind, it seems logical that Apple replaced a number of system fonts that
  previously were dfont files with regular Truetype (.ttf or .ttc) fonts. Getting
  rid of the 'non-standard' dfont format seems like a nice clean-up. But oddly Apple
  chose not to replace all dfont system fonts with regular TrueType equivalents. There
  are still a few dfont fonts in OS X 10.6. Why did they keep this clutter of TrueType
  formats?\r\n\r\n'TrueType Collection' (.ttc) is a new type of TrueType font packaging,
  in which multiple variants of a font are stored in one single file. One could consider
  this clean, simple and a good way of limiting file clutter. Unfortunately Apple
  is inconsistent in its use of this .ttc file format. Why isn't it used for all the
  TrueType font families that ship with OS X 10.6? Why use this technique for some
  families but not for others?"

  body: True, but Apple has up to now published very little technical information
    about Snow Leopard. I have yet to find a list of all the fonts that are included
    in the OS. Where is their own in-depth overview of what changed regarding font
    handling? I have more confidence in this forum than in my ability to get an actual
    reply from Apple.

    target="_blank">OpenType specification</a>. And just because Windows does not
    support dfont does not make it a non-standard format, not even in quotation marks.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)

    am not asking for anyone's guess, just hoping that someone knows the reason why
    Apple for instance chose to still use the dfont format for a few specific system
    fonts."
