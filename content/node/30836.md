  magazine is WISH from The Australian Newspaper.\r\nAny help would be appreciated
  as I have exhausted my knowldege.\r\n\r\nThe serif C and G seem distinct.\r\nThe
  sans g also seems distinct.\r\n\r\n"

    Face Baskerville</a>. Many here at typophile seems to rate the recent versions
    by <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php?id=22\">Frantisek
    Storm</a>.\r\n\r\nThe sans serif strapline is er, something that will doubtlessly
    be recognised instantly by someone else here; all I can say is it's not News Gothic,
    Trade Gothic or Franklin Gothic because of the hook of the 'r' and the position
    of the ear on the 'g'. It appears to be more contemporary than those, but they're
    the nearest I can suggest at this point."
