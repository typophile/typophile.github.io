  interesting legibility points. I found this thread that Chris Lozos started a while
  ago that addresses this: http://typophile.com/node/6026\r\n\r\nSince I'm in the
  process of developing a signage face I'm wondering just what makes a typeface most
  legible. How do you begin to test this? What letterform shapes have the greatest
  capacity for cognition? Is Century Schoolbook just as legible on a sign as Frutiger?
  Sans serif, serif or a mix of the two? How much is lettershape cognition based on
  country or region of origin? Is there any conclusive proof or studies supporting
  any of these ideas or theories?\r\n\r\nI thought it was a shame that this thread
  fizzled out, I think its an important concern.  \r\n"

  body: "I remember reading a study several years back that suggested that the comparative
    legibility of serif vs. sans serif type was based more on the age of the reader
    than on his or her country of origin. The study concluded that older readers found
    serif type more legible because that's what they grew up reading; younger readers
    found sans serifs more legible.\r\n\r\nAs best I can recall, the study is now
    more than thirty years old. I am fairly confident that the conclusions are still
    reasonably valid, but with a twist. The range of typefaces available now has expanded
    public awareness of the tremendous range of possibilities for expressing individual
    letterforms, so what is legible to the younger reader of today might well seem
    like hieroglyphics to his or her grandparents.\r\n\r\nBut we're talking about
    signage here, and good signs aren't intended to be works of art, but rather useful
    tools, and really shouldn't require decipherment. Probably the best test of the
    utility of a typeface used for signage is that individual letterforms be <strong>unambiguous</strong>.
    If they pass that test, all other design considerations are superfluous."

  body: "Research has been done on both country of origin and age.  My poor memory
    doesn't have the details (perhaps it was the Royal College?).  From what I remember
    of the conclusions it seems countries like England and the U.S. were more prone
    to read serif; countries like Germany and Switzerland were more prone to read
    sans better. This fits Nick's \"what they grew up reading\" theory as well. \r\nI
    have not seen a book that compares a large crossection of legibility literature
    since Rolf Rehe's 1972 book \"Typography How to Make it Most Legible\".  This
    book still did not satisfy my curiosity then and very much has happened since.
    The \"Typo\" readability issue http://www.magtypo.cz/english.html was a good beginning
    but I still have not seen work that gets at the whole problem enough to be practical.
    \ There has been far more research done in signage mostly by engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I am surprised Chris' original post didn't stir more discussion. Thanks for
    reviving the topic, Terry. \r\n\r\nChris asks a lot of questions, inadvertently
    revealing the state of legibility 'science' in the process. We really don't have
    any definitive answers to most of those questions yet. \r\n\r\nI maintain that
    any serious inquiry will require a long gestation period, sufficient funding,
    and input from a variety of experts, most crucially typographers. It might help
    to narrow the question down a lot. This is presumably what would be done in lab
    testing. Suppose we say we are discussing text typefaces designed for immersive
    reading, as in books? That helps us avoid distractions about display type, signs,
    glare, children, etc. and lets us focus on immersive reading issues like comfort,
    speed, etc. But Terry's project pertains to signage. So maybe we should narrow
    it down to wayfinding typefaces for particular environments, i.e. large metropolitan
    transit systems. That would take us someplace very different from the discussion/study
    of ideal book faces. \r\n\r\nTerry, how would you like to frame the discussion?
    It's clear that these areas overlap, but you may get farther if the topic is more
    specific. I'm all for starting 2 threads: 'Optimal Signage Legibility Fonts' and
    'Optimal Book Legibility Faces', if not more. "

  body: "Hmmmm, Carl...maybe there should be two threads on this. I'll go ahead and
    start the signage one. I am also interested in the legibility for reading because
    I wonder if the two overlap. \r\n\r\nActually...I did start a thread similar to
    that a while back, with very little response. Environmental design doesn't seem
    to be too terribly popular here. "
