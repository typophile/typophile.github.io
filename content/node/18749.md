body: Is there a set number or maximum number of digits that the Type-1 Unique ID
  Number can be?  Also, are there applications, OS versions, or printers that sometimes
  have trouble reading fonts that have no ID numbers, or longer ID numbers?  What
  might happen if two fonts loaded on one system shared the same ID number?  Thanks
  in advance.

  body: "Here's a slightly updated/expanded version of some information that I wrote
    for Adobe developer support on this question. (Edited again on 3/23 to improve
    clarity/accuracy.)\r\n\r\nYes, Type 1 UniqueIDs are a set number. No, neither
    Type 1 nor OpenType CFF fonts require UniqueIDs. Nothing will break if you omit
    them.\r\n\r\nBack in the mid-80s, when printing might be done on a 57K serial
    connection and printers might have 8 MHz processors, the caching of font bitmaps
    in PostScript devices enabled by UniqueIDs made a noticeable speed difference.
    With today's connection bandwidths and printers, the printing speed difference
    was insignificant for western-language fonts in our tests, and not enough to outweigh
    the risks of collisions between UniqueIDs for different fonts and the trouble
    of tracking the ID numbers. (Note that there did seem to still be some advantage
    for our Asian fonts with 10,000-25,000 glyphs.)\r\n\r\nA collision between UniqueIDs
    can cause glyphs from the first font printed to substitute for those of the second
    font with the same UniqueID. Although it is rare, it is a serious problem - and
    hard to diagnose when it happens, because it is rare enough that most people have
    never seen it themselves before.\r\n\r\nIf you must use UniqueIDs for some reason,
    you should get them assigned by Adobe to minimize the risk of collisions.\r\n\r\nXUIDs
    can be guaranteed to be unique, thanks to the extensible mechanisms and vendor
    ID registration involved. However, the same comments about minimal speed improvement
    apply here.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Adobe has stopped using UniqueIDs (and XUIDs)
    in our western OpenType CFF fonts. If we still made Type 1 fonts, we wouldn't
    use UniqueIDs for them, either. We *do* in fact still use XUIDs and UniqueIDs
    in Asian CID-keyed fonts, because the same analysis showed that there was some
    printing performance benefit in this case.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: 'Thanks Thomas.  Regarding the ID being a fixed number--sure once it''s set
    it is fixed, but is there a set number of digits that it needs to be?  Most I''ve
    seen are 7 digits long, but if you have an 8-digit ID, are there issues that can
    come up?  '
