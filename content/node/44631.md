  body: "The link for Sandoll Gothic is here: <a href=\"https://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/shop/product_down_read.asp?idx=187&listType=2\">https://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/shop/product_down_read.asp?idx=187&listType=2</a>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    purchasing the font is extremely convoluted for a non-Korean, mainly because the
    site is only available in Korean. You have to become a member, which requires
    you to e-mail or fax them a copy of your passport or driver's licence unless you're
    Korean and have a national identification number. Unless you have a working knowledge
    of Korean, you'll need a Korean speaker to guide you through the steps. The situation
    will be similar with other Korean foundries. You have South Korea's excessive
    regulation of internet commerce to thank...\r\n\r\nThere is a vendor I found whose
    page is in English offering mostly Yoon Design fonts: <a href=\"http://asiasoft.com/bin/category/?mainCatID=2&subCatID=9\">http://asiasoft.com/bin/category/?mainCatID=2&subCatID=9</a>\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    if you have $1585 to spare, <a href=\"http://asiasoft.com/bin/product/?itemCode=ADDW2K&search=\">the
    Korean version of Adobe InDesign CS2</a> comes bundled with an impressive range
    of releases by all the major Korean foundries..."

  body: "Sunil, I'm pretty sure that the EULA of Sandoll Gothic prevents one from
    sending it to someone else who hasn't bought the licence. In general, you can't
    just ask someone to send you a commercial font.\r\n\r\nIf you are not willing
    to pay for commercial fonts, then try to look for free alternatives, at least.
    Here is a link where you can download two quality free fonts, including Nanum
    Gothic, also from Sandoll:\r\n\r\nhttp://hangeul.naver.com/index.nhn?goto=fonts#fonts\r\n"

    and no alternative. Suggest if there is a way to get the font free or any other
    site where i can get it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nregards\r\nsunil"

  body: "Write to Sandoll directly and explain why you need the font for free. I'm
    serious. If you make your case convincingly, they might be open to granting you
    the licence for free. I know Sandoll has done promotions of this sort where they
    encourage those who can't afford their library, like cash-strapped NGOs for example,
    to explain why they need Sandoll fonts, and selected entrants can get the fonts
    for free.\r\n\r\nI've heard an anecdote about a penniless graphic designer writing
    to Process Type Foundry with a similar request, and he was also granted the fonts
    for free.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. If this doesn't work, and you absolutely need
    Sandoll Gothic, then be prepared to pay for it, because it's a commercial product
    that some people spent years developing, and they are well within their rights
    to charge people for the licence to use it."
