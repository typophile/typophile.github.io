    So the rest of the type is Helvetica Thin. '

    identify which one it was. It looks like Thin Extended though right? Seems a little
    short for thin.\r\n\r\nBut thanks for the Trade Gothic, I would have never guessed!
    It looks so good.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Btw, the Trade Gothic font on the website looks a lot more bolded. I couldn't
    find any Trade Gothic fonts beyond bold. Is there an extra bold that exists?

    it's not actually Trade Gothic (most of the Geometric Sans look the same to me.)
    \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the Helvetica, It's possible it is extended. It's too difficult
    to tell at that size, but judging from the N and M, it appears to be.\r\n\r\nI'll
    recheck my Trade Gothic guess."

    but they just don't have an extra bold one that looks like what we're seeing.

    that style well.\r\n\r\nAre you recreating the website or something? It's also
    possible that they added a stroke to \"thicken\" the look up."

    deal, I just like it so much."
