  used in the graphic below? I'll even settle for a similar style font in hopes of
  possibly creating my own stencil if need be. Just at my wits end of trying to figure
  this out. \r\n\r\nAny help is indeed greatly appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/nhb_6537.jpg]"
