  body: "Since Pradell was based on the work of a Catalan punchcutter that would be
    a logical and appropriate style, but to me the details are quite different. I
    think this lettering looks more like Garamond, but customized with the extensions/ligatures
    we see in the photo.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
