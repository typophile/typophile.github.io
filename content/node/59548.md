  have the font file. The font's name is Swiss 721 Cn BT, but what does Cn and BT
  stand for? I figure Cn means condensed, but BT? Could someone help me out with this,
  or even better... point me to the correct font on MyFonts? I'd love to buy it. :-)\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Thanks, Jan. Found it prior to your post, but was a little unsure on the BT
    acronym. Thought it might have been a font term that I didn't know. But again.
    Thanks. :-)
