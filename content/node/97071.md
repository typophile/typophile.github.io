  body: "Possibly custom. The closest I have, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ixipcalli/metrica/|Metrica]],
    almost perfectly matching, just needs to be vertically scaled. You could also
    consider it as totally reconstructed from the letter shape /o.\r\nMore in the
    same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/titanium/|Titanium]] (/d and
    /p need to be reconstructed from /o), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/magistral/|Magistral]]
    (same work as Titanium), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/rendtphysic/|Rendtphysic]]
    (slightly too much extended)\r\nFree alternatives: [[http://www.dafont.com/electro-static-rain.font|Electro
    Static]] (overall design's not matching but not too much work to do and free...),
    [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/maven-pro|Maven]] (/o is pretty close, keep
    it and rebuild everything from it) and [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Sansation|Sansation]]
    (same work as Maven)"
