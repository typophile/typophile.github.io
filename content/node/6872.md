  body: That&#39;s the way Adobe sets up fonts to prepare them for interpolation.
    What you&#39;re seeing are the start and end points, which are located only one
    unit apart from each other. This is to prevent the start and end points from overlapping
    if there are any rounding errors in the interpolation process. <BR> <BR>Alan
