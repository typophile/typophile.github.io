  on a website that is not identical to, but clearly based off of, my freeware font
  clementine sketch.\r\n\r\nHere is my font:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/Clementine-Sketch.font\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's the knock-off:\r\nhttp://www.scrapnfonts.com/searchdetail.php?psku=12384\r\n\r\nI've
  contacted the people in charge of the website, but of course they are insisting
  that the two fonts just happen to be similar -- and since the font IS redrawn and
  not identical to mine, they're just taking advantage of the loophole in the copyright
  laws governing fonts. So I'm not sure if there's anything I can do.. It just pisses
  me off that someone is profiting off of an ugly version of a font that I'm offering
  as freeware. (And then refusing to even admit that it's a knock off.) \r\n\r\nIs
  there anything that I can do in this situation?\r\nThanks for any help.\r\n\r\n-Teagan

    knock-off is not. I'd totally help you tell everyone that that site is lame for
    charging for a knock-off of your free font, and it would probably make yours more
    popular. Twitter may work.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think theirs has many differences
    from yours. While most of these seem like horrible butchering in order to claim
    it's different, I'd want more proof that it's indeed a rip-off before spreading
    the information and in order to convince others."

  body: "In terms of more proof -- Can't give you anything concrete, since the website
    owners are trying to deny that it's a knock-off. But, here's what they say about
    getting the font to work correctly:\r\n\r\n\"To get just the right effect with
    this font, start each word with a capital letter (it will be a lowercase letter
    with the left side of the outline capped off) and end each word with the right
    bracket, ]. Try it! It's an Awesome] Font]!\"\r\n\r\n...Pretty sure I invented
    that, except mine uses the ^ symbol instead of a bracket."

    means they took it down.\r\nCan't wait to see your two new fonts finished!"

    they finally agreed to take it down.
