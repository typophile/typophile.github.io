    Done just as Stephen describes: shutter open in dark room, Picasso draws figure,
    at very end pop flash, close shutter.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mili_picasso_6620.jpg]'

  body: "or if you are not a purist.\r\n\r\nImport or scan your base 'type' design.\r\nNeeds
    to have a photographic background or similar to work, like in your example\r\nCopy
    the 'type' layer in Photoshop four/five+ times.\r\nBlur each layer to different
    amounts, nudge them about a bit, alter the colours, impose different blends on
    each color dodge/screen/overlay.\r\nBasically experiment to you find what you
    are looking for.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yep, along with belleisle advice there's lots of ways to achieve the neon
    glow effect in Photoshop.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GlowLines_4921.JPG]\r\n\r\nOne
    real simple way is to use the Pen tool to create your shapes and on a new layer
    above it fill with colour and set the blending mode to Color. You could copy your
    shape to a new layer below it and apply to slight gauss blurr to achieve a diffused
    effect. In my example I just used two layers on a black bg. \r\n\r\nclauses, groovy
    linkage. Check out camera tossing on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=camera+tossing\r\n\r\n__________\r\nHiro"
