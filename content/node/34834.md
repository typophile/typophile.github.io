body: "So, I'm thinking about giving blogging a go. Per the nature of this site, I'll
  post on type design and typography, along with other matters related to graphic
  design. This won't be too constraining since these topics tend to occupy much of
  my time anyway.\r\n\r\nA brief introduction: My first serious exposure to graphic
  design was in 7th grade when I was taught Photoshop and quickly became enthralled
  with its incredible creative power. After several years getting to know the program
  inside and out, I moved on to InDesign and Illustrator to layout my high school
  newspaper. In the course of working on the paper, I started to consider type as
  I never had before. Reading Bringhurst's <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>
  crystallized my interest in typography, and I've been hooked ever since. I joined
  Typophile a little while after, and I've been a mildly active member in the year
  and a bit that followed.\r\n\r\nNow that my biographical whims have been satisfied,
  I'll try to keep what I write more interesting (I hope)."

  body: Sorry about that. It's probably no consolation, but I feel a bit out of sorts
    myself that my 8-year-old cousin makes PowerPoint presentations.
