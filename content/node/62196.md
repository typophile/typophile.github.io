  you please suggest a sans serif font that is a good combination with Centaur?\r\nAlso,
  would you recommend any other serif/sans serif font combinations which are historically
  relevant to art and museums?\r\nAny feedback would be much appreciated.\r\n...Thank
  you!"

  body: Centaur, in its digital incarnation, is a weak typeface. You could try <a
    href="http://store4.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1716">Adobe
    Jenson</a>, based on the same sources.

  body: "Hi Neha,\r\n\r\nyou might like <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FontPackages/SuperFamilies/11-01-2004.htm\">Legacy</a>.
    Like Centaur, it is a revival of the work of [[Nicolas Jenson]] \u2013 and it
    has a sans companion!\r\nFurthermore, I can imagine <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/today-sans/\">Today
    Sans</a> to work quite well.\r\n\r\nRelated thread: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31046\">Sans

  body: '@Manlio: digital Monotype Centaur is weak, but my accurate digital reconstruction,
    <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/museum.html">Museum</a>, is much stronger.
    Unfortunately, quite incomplete, so, while it might be usable for some display
    work, it''s nowhere near ready for being a text face for a book.'

  body: "Shinntype's <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins Sans</a>
    has a small x-height and large contrast between cap and lower case stem widths.\r\n\r\nYou
    could use it with an oldstyle like Centaur or Bembo, or with <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html\">Scotch
    Modern</a>, which it was designed to partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
