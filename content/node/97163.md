    like this.\r\nBut if this is the way the font is spaced by default, it\u2019s
    \uFB01ne."

  body: "Thanks. I'm working with tracking increments of \xB125 but if I decide to
    go finer I'll tighten the \"TH\".\r\n\r\nBTW as you can see it's Times, and at
    least the version on my system needs a good deal of help when set in all-caps.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "What is the final size and application?\r\n\r\nIf it is 24pt or less I would
    be inclined to open it slightly, using EAL as the basis. On my screen it appears
    at 18mm cap height at that size I would tighten TH by a gnat\u2019s as Nick suggested
    and possibly EA by two gnat\u2019s.\r\n\r\nTim"

    I'll have to move down to increments of 10.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "While it appears superficially that the T and H should be closer, my initial
    impression was that everything was right. So I'd be hesitant to pit a judgment
    focusing on the appearance of an individual combination instead of the font as
    a whole.\r\n\r\nOf course, in any case, correct letterspacing is <em>much</em>
    more critical in the lowercase."
