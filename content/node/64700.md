body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nBrief is for a draftsman and interior design company combined-
  must be simple fresh and modern. They wanted to avoid \"house\" type logo's.\r\nHere
  is the bw version- the colour version is white on blue happy to post if interested.\r\nI
  have also done another version of all of these logos incorporating (at lower opacity
  a blueprint)...but i am going to try and convince them that it would be best suited
  for website or etc.\r\nThese are rough ideas so far....please help I'm going crazy.
  \r\n\r\nTIA,\r\n\r\nMaree.\r\n"

    a simple reason: the briefing is too simple.\r\n\r\n- What kind of target-clients
    are they seeking?\r\n- Which are the idiosyncrasies of their work? Do they have
    a particular style?\r\n- Why would they want to redesign their brand?\r\n- Which
    kind of people would seek your client's services?\r\n\r\nWhen you and your client
    are not happy with anything, start fresh. And remember: do not show your client
    anything that you dislike. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "in avoiding the \"house type logos\" can I ask why you've decided to focus
    on the drafting/blueprint approach? That seems pretty housey to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nin
    some of the option spresented I can't work out if it's IRW or LRW.\r\nwhat do
    the letters stand for? do lrw and 'designs' need to be given the same amount of
    focus? I think it would be a lot more flexible concentrating on the interplay
    of LRW and dealing with the 'designs' bit later<br />\r\n\r\nthat's my 2 cent
    invoice anyway.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul</strong>\r\n<a

  body: "Thanks everyone appreciate all your comments...and I'm feeling a bit better
    this morning!\r\n\r\nLula- thanks but I have all that info in 2 pages of copious
    notes on exactly those questions and more when I met them..I didn't think I needed
    to type it all out here. \r\n\r\nMark- yes I see it now- its called delerium and
    desparation :)\r\n\r\nGeeza- thanks will have a play with that.\r\n\r\nRatbaggy-
    in saying avoiding house logos I actually meant a physical house symbol...they
    actually want to do more residential work- i tried a key type reference(where
    the \"i\" is) I tried a doorknob motif somewhere...I just don't know. The clients
    wanted a blueprint blue- etc because they pride themselves on their superior documentation.
    \r\nIt's actually L.R.W (initials) I tried some designs that way but client had
    a strong preference (before i even started designing- they havent seen anything
    yet) for lowercase which in terms of consistency of their branding/website etc
    I can see their point. I did try playing with the lrw bit but everything looked
    old school and not modern- or TOO modern....but you've got me thinking will try
    some more tonight. Thanks so much.\r\n\r\nM.\r\n"

    Even the house-like interdiction.\r\nBlueprints, for instance, are a reference
    from technical designers to technical designers, this may truncate the type of
    clients their image attracts.\r\n\r\nFrankly, what I mean is: if you can't use
    \"house\" as a concept/figuration, what will you use instead? You've presented
    many concepts, one proposal for each.\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad english, hope this
    helps!\r\n\r\nCheers!"
