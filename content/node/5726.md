body: I am currently putting together an exhibition for a gallery in the UK of poster
  design from around the world. Though the posters for the exhibition are all contemporary,
  I&#39;ve been fasinated by many older posters too. <BR> <BR>The posters of Bachs
  &#40;see picture below&#41; are fantastic, and his work was something I was never
  aware of.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/41240.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>Also Wes Wilson, I had never come across his name before but now
  Iam rapidly building up a collection of his posters via ebay... <BR> <BR>Anyway,
  I wondered who your poster hero&#39;s are...
