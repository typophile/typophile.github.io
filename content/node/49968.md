  a book in StormType's Walbaum Text with Optima all-caps titling, but there are several
  places where I'd like to use Walbaum at titling sizes.\r\n\r\nI like Storm's cut
  because they softened the face with slightly rounded edges of the serifs. The serifs
  also have slightly \"scupped\" top and bottom faces. I think this gentle flaring
  of the characters works nicely with Optima's bell-bottom-wearing profiles. But,
  Storm's cut is meant for use at 11-point and below - these rounded shapes look too
  chunky when enlarged.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a cut of Walbaum that has thinner
  and perfectly square serifs like H&FJ's gorgeous Didot for use at display sizes?\r\n\r\nI
  suppose I could sneak a little Didot in where needed (purists gasp here), but it's
  got that Frenchy look.....and this is a book about German philosophy no less (Kant,
  Schopenhauer!)\r\n\r\nI may just have to settle for using tiny tracked-out Walbaum
  small caps subtitles under Optima titles...\r\n\r\nThanks - DiSH"
