<p>A brief collection of (somewhat hostile) opinions I’ve seen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple, are you seriously making a mimicry of Roboto, which the typographic community have despised for a million times?</li>
<li>Apple, are you seriously copying prevalent neo-grotesks like Akkurat or LL Circular? (This rhetorical question is followed usually by an onslaught against Apple’s degraded moral integrity.)</li>
<li>Apple, your copycat neo-grotesk is done so badly, it’s like Arial when in comparison with Helvetica.</li>
<li>Apple, are you out of your ideas? Another Helvetica mimicry? I was waiting for a more original design and you’ve disappointed me.</li>
<li>For no reason, sans-serifs – especially neo-grotesks – are inherently bad. Those who are obsessed with this “Helvetica fad” are out of their minds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

<p>I think some people grossly overestimate the importance of system font selection, and few can do better than grossly underestimate the complexity of system font deployment.</p>
<p>For example: 
&ldquo;6. Susan Kare&rsquo;s original San Francisco was better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opinions abound, but the original S.F. did not play out so well to all of unicode, as this font must. So who cares? People who will argue over the techno-aesthetic comparison of two fonts that share nothing but the same name and publisher, kind of seem weirdly tripped out to me.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for a watch, but I will. That&rsquo;s the One and Only Way to know how good this font is. Pretty good marketing to type designers, no?</p>

<p>What it reminded me of was DIN, but moderated in the direction of a conventional sans-serif like Univers or Helvetica. Roboto may have some DIN influence too in its upper-case, but not to the same extent; by comparison, Roboto is close to News Gothic.</p>
<p>Akkurat? Not even close.</p>
<p>So to me, the question is: will the straight sides taken from DIN really improve the appearance of this typeface on dot-matrix displays, which is presumably the intent? Or, given the prevalence of high-resolution displays on mobile devices, was this an unfortunate step at the wrong time?</p>

<p>The display set uses proportional figures as default, what disrupts alignment on date or size columns (and also some menubar apps). Its huge x-height may work in very small displays with a minimum of text, like Apple Watch, but soon becomes very annoying in other scenarios — like Mac OS menus and dialogs.</p>
<p>Although better, the text set shares a number of  problems with the display one:
– error on dollar symbol;
– bad interpolated heavy Œ;
– breve accent misplaced in every occurrence;
– grave/acute bad positioning, especially with i;
– poor tilde and caron design.</p>
<p>The fonts also support only Latin extended, without Cyrillic, Greek and phonetic sets (Mac OS will invoke another font for these). Note that San Francisco is part of Apple Watch SDK, aimed to developers. So, this is not a beta testing initiative by Apple to improve font quality. It is simply an incomplete, unpolished typeface which may or may not be corrected upon Watch release.</p>

<p>Good point. However Apple&rsquo;s dual track records of not caring much about typographic quality lately and not really believing in open beta-testing mean the release version of these fonts will probably maintain many of these problems.</p>

This is not true considering Yosemite’s public beta programs.
<p>I think Apple will take the time to make things right. Apple Watch has been introduced as the first “one-more-thing” after Jobs, and that reflects how serious and ambitious Apple is regarding this product. If the Hellvetica mania on Yosemite is Jony Ive’s personal obsession, then I think this time San Francisco won’t be affected by that.</p>
<p>One of my friends has replaced his iOS system font with San Francisco. Everything seem to have been working fine for now.</p>

<p>The resolution of the fonts is around 3 times the resolution of the watch face, so the units per em of this font file would not likely effect rendering on this device. The reason 984 was chosen for this font is likely to be found in the combination of divisibility and file size reduction.</p>
<p>If this is a 1 x 1.25 inch device with a 384 dpi display, (which BTW, is 4.555 pixels per point), it&rsquo;s likely that a 984 unit font would work faster, and take up less space than a 2048 per em font, without any visual degradation. This would also save untold byte space in a font with an extensive glyph repertoire.</p>
<p>It is that extensive glyph repertoire, and previous hints of Apple not keeping much in residence on future devices, and knowing just how precious every single bit of space and processing power is in a wearable, that leads me to believe this font is going places. ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh, I was wrong about the integer point size advantage. Might there be an integer advantage somewhere else?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see how it makes sense to use 984 instead of 1000 after all. The savings (assuming compression, since otherwise anything from 513 to 1024 is the same) is very minimal, and sticking to 1000 (even with 2048 being an option) still has advantages in terms of robustness. In fact people have been reporting a bug related to deviating from 1000 UPM in OSX; it&rsquo;s ironic that Apple&rsquo;s own flagship typeface suffers from that.</p>
<blockquote>this font is going places.</blockquote>
<p>In the heart of every fanboy, there was never any doubt; for some even Chalkboard would&rsquo;ve been hailed as a genial choice. Nevermind that using a font that makes Apple look like Android (just like the size jump of the new iPhones) is supposed to be highly offensive, and more significantly, weakens the brand.</p>

It strikes me because I’m surprised how two typefaces that may look similar on the larger scale would be so much different when put into actual use.

Apple is definitely doing something on the cross-language typesetting aspect. First they’ve replaced most of the website typefaces with PingHei (CN, by Sinotype) and Apple TP (JP, by Type Project). And now this... I think they’ve definitely thought about multilingual typography.
<p>Increasingly confining latin letterforms to the grid is one thing to harmonize Latin and CJK scripts, but I think it’s far more than that. There’s already a consciousness about pairing typefaces based on their personalities and formal qualities, and I think it’s also possible to explore their pasts and work from the origin ground up (also a kind of denominator?), i.e. examining calligraphic reminiscence or history of how a particular typeface was achieved.</div>

Therefore I would draw the conclusion that there is no benefit to the reader or appearance of design cohesion whatsoever to designing typefaces with asian and western capabilities. However in forcing Roman letters to conform to Chinese formatting, the letter &lsquo;i&rsquo; becomes barely comparable to &rsquo;m'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the past several decades the Chinese language has been compromised far more brutally by Roman standards, and while even bold Chinese text doesn&rsquo;t carry the same significance as bold Roman, italicised Chinese characters would be greatly insulting, which could possibly be a future consequence of &lsquo;Asianisation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Definitely true. One have to have deep knowledge in both fields to pull this stuff off. But no, I don’t think they’re inept in this. They’ve got the right partners – On the CN side, Sinotype has been a long time partner with Apple (starting from Snow Leopard’s Heiti SC/TC) and also an influential foundry in China; on the JP side, Apple has Dainippon Screens (reliable foundry whose Hiragino Sans GB has been unanimously praised) and AXIS, whom I think is a new but promising partner. I don’t know for the Korean side, but in both CN and JP, Apple’s got some of the best people in this industry.</p>
<p>P.S. I know Dainippon Screens and AXIS are great foundries, but I wonder why Apple hasn’t cooperated with Morisawa&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with all the foundries you mention, but expertise in one script is weakly correlated with proper <em>harmonization</em> of multiple scripts; in fact experts in a script can be stubborn when it comes to adapting&hellip; Most &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; multi-script fonts typically take a textbook Latin design (like the Frutiger genre) and cosmetically adapt a non-Latin script to it, sometimes riding roughshod over the requirements of the script.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When have I said that livestock don&rsquo;t buy crap? When have I said that I&rsquo;m important to Apple? Mainly I&rsquo;m simply presenting two thought-out opinions based on my own observations and experience since at least the early 80s:
1: People without a single multi-cultural bone in their body shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted to deeply address multi-script type design. Compared to maybe a hundred people I know –and yes, including myself– you really have little clue beyond Latin. And Apple has some holes in that respect as well – just look at the Armenian that comes with OSX!
2: No matter how many devices this new San Francisco typeface gets shipped on, the logic pointing to its inadvisable proximity to its main competitor&rsquo;s core typeface would remain. It&rsquo;s simply not OK for somebody to look at an Apple Watch and think –even for an instant– that Samsung made it. This situation was entirely avoidable, but I think Apple has become more imitative than many people realize.</p>
<p>As before, I think your recurring core problem here is that any hint of criticism of Apple (just a few months ago you were fervently defending Helvetica as a great choice for UI&hellip;) results in an arrogant lashing out, even to the point of ignoring the obvious. You give zero credit for anything to anybody who disagrees with you on anything, no matter how many years they&rsquo;re wrestled with something you&rsquo;ve never thought cost-effective to bother with.</p>

I see it as very much associated with the era of low-res screens.
High-res screens should prompt designers to use more serif types, emulating the capabilities of print. That’s already happening in many apps.</p>
<p>The Apple watchface layouts have been designed from the outside, matching the simplicity and modernity of the hardware, and using the corporate UI style. But there are typographic means other than the mid-century modern International Style, to present information on such devices.<br>

<p>Serif typography is especially relevant since an expensive watch is about high fashion (and yes, not legibility). In fact this clearly applies to Apple as a whole, since they&rsquo;ve been hiring high-profile execs from the fashion world lately.</p>
<p>One technical issue however is that serif type doesn&rsquo;t mesh as well with Apple&rsquo;s anti-hinting philosophy.</p>

<cite>BTW it&rsquo;s funny how certain people accuse Android of ripping off FF DIN, without even bothering to learn where that comes from.</cite></p>
<p>To me, DIN means Deutsches Institut für Normung; they specified a style of lettering for use in drafting. (The Russians tended to use this style of lettering as well; in the U.S., Keuffel &amp; Esser&rsquo;s Leroy lettering guides were more influential - being a richer country, such luxuries were more affordable, and hand lettering was looked down on in drafting.) That it was FontFont that made a font called DIN based on this lettering style is, to me at least, secondary.</p>
<p>While San Francisco isn&rsquo;t similar enough to DIN to be called a copy, it comes closer to DIN than it does to several of the other typefaces of which it has been accused of being a copy.</p>
<p>@Nick Shinn:
<cite>But there are typographic means other than the mid-century modern International Style, to present information on such devices.</cite></p>
<p>Looking at information presented on the high-resolution screen of my smartphone, I can well believe that it is not strictly necessary to use a sans-serif typeface in order to maintain the illusion of infinite-resolution print.</p>
<p>For branding reasons, though, no doubt designers at both Google and Apple want their devices to fairly shout <em>Modernity!</em>, and for that, a sans-serif face is more appropriate.</p>
<p>As to your illustration, however, the use of narrow italics, a change of font to upper-case/small capitals instead of boldface, a typeface with a small x-height, and oldstyle figures&hellip; represents a direction in which they will not go for <em>good</em> reason.</p>
<p>If they use a serif face, it would be something more like, say, Corona.</p>
<p>As to whether &ldquo;the vogue for sans serifs&rdquo; will &ldquo;last forever&rdquo; - well, literally, the Latin alphabet will not last forever. Sans-serif, though, is a simple option, whereas there are many different styles of serif. Bracketed serifs, the mainstay of serif type, are more likely to disappear from use than sans-serif.</p>
<p>However, just as Bell Gothic was useful in letting I, 1, and l be distinguishable, a more reasonable alternative they might consider, if one needs a monoline face to disguise resolution limits, would be an Egyptian like Memphis or Stymie.</p>
<p>As for the Asianization of Latin script - San Francisco is not a typewriter-like monospace font, and so I don&rsquo;t immediately see how that could be a factor here, at least in a simple and direct manner.</p>

<p>I know, so why send me to look!? The way I see Armenian, all the &ldquo;good&rdquo; stuff appears designed for an auto body repair shop, and all the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; stuff looks like it was designed by the auto body repair shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Berlow, why do you think it’s impossible to go deeper than typeface pairing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I’ll be killing two birds with one stone, which won’t sit well. There’s this IP running loose, saying every light font in the universe is: “Anorexic!”, (or even more entertainingly, Apple Computer’s way of promoting anorexia). Laughable, I know — I do constantly. That same, loose-running IP says: “The Latin Script” killed the world’s other scripts, including his beloved auto body shop script.</p>
<p>But if you are concerned about UI font design and specification, as oppposed to the typical fear and anger of the future, do this simple math, you’ll see neither of those are really true and/or unavoidable: The average Latin word is 5 glyphs, the average Latin glyph has 2 strokes (conservatively), for an average of 10 strokes per Latin word. The average Latin stroke in a Latin readability font is 1/10th of the em, and&hellip; the average Latin word has as much space horizontally, as it takes, to present that word.</p>
<p>The average Chinese glyph is two words and has as much space horizontally as all other Chinese glyphs. Two words with a conservative Latin stroke count, is already 20 Chinese glyph strokes (not at all uncommon among Chinese glyphs). If one is lucky ;) 1/2 half of those average average average Chinese glyph strokes are vertical and 1/2 horizontal. But if the Chinese design has the same weight as a readable Latin, the em is full of strokes in both directions, with 0 white space. Nothing is too important to leave out entirely, so something’s got to give, and that is the ideal reading weight of the Latin.</p>
<p>This is all just rule of thumb, unless one has fonts fully dictionaried with a 1:1 contour to stroke ratio, and python, it’s hard to be more precise, (and I have a lot of NDAs). But anyone with a brain can tell you for sure, even before seeing Chinese on the watch, Some of Apple’s Latin system fonts are lighter than Latin’s ideal weight. And this little talk is only about strokes and space, leaving out the other 6 parts of the universal mantra from nothing (space), to ideas (glyph or string of glyphs), which is also full of compromises by each script.</p>
<p>It is a very small world we are looking at here. So, no room yet for serifs, hinting, script wars, or complete residence, i.e. “these fonts are going places” was not a fan reaction?, it was a technical specification, duh.;)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just evidence of your blindness. But you can&rsquo;t admit any failing; for example not that an Armenian typeface delivered to a client a few years ago had a couple of entirely defective letters, even though the client was charged an arm and a leg. I know people who do better work for free.</p>
<p>Latinization is a real problem, and I&rsquo;m not remotely the only one saying it. Only cultural chauvinism (perhaps stemming from not having a single cultural, nevermind multi-cultural, bone in one&rsquo;s body) prevents the admission of that. This is something I was sad to realize many years ago, when reading a talk synopsis, which I will one day dig up. It was basically an ineloquent version of the following by Morison:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Roman alphabet is not merely in possession, but it is in possession by right of conquest. The conquest was not made possible, or even expedited, by external authority; the victory of the Roman letter was due to its inherent flexibility and rationalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will Latin one day start shifting to look more like Chinese? That&rsquo;s entirely plausible, considering the world&rsquo;s probable economic future. But there is no evidence at all that it has already started down that path. And anyway, for the short term, instead of using voodoo math as blinders to actual design, come to Granshan in July to open your eyes to the broader world of type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stanley Morison (as Hrant tells us), back before we became sensitive to cultural diversity, went and said:</p>
<p><cite>The Roman alphabet is not merely in possession, but it is in possession by right of conquest. The conquest was not made possible, or even expedited, by external authority; the victory of the Roman letter was due to its inherent flexibility and rationalism.</cite></p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that the Chinese or Japanese writing systems, never mind Akkadian cuneiform or Egyptian hieroglyphics, would be a better way to write.</p>
<p>However, beyond that, it is hard to defend such a sentiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that when it comes to mechanical simplicity of typesetting, the Latin alphabet has some advantages over the Ethiopic scripts, the Indic scripts (Devanagari, Thai, Burmese, Cambodian, Tibetan, and so on), the Korean script, or the Arabic script. However, the obstacles to handling these scripts on typewriters, let alone mechanical typesetters, were far from insuperable.</p>
<p>And when it comes to Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Georgian, or Hebrew - there is no inherent superiority for the Latin script; for all practical purposes, there is an equivalency.</p>
<p>Well, one could note the ink smudging problem with Hebrew&rsquo;s writing direction for right-handed writers, to say the equivalence isn&rsquo;t absolutely exact.</p>
<p>One can praise the victory of the ancient Phoenician writing system, having most of the scripts listed above as its descendants, excluding the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ones, without being too chauvinistic. Alphabets did help bring about mass literacy, and that was a good and progressive thing.</p>
<p>I do agree that it&rsquo;s a problem when a people are hindered in carrying out the development of their script in a culturally authentic way. This is just one of the minor negative consequences of, say, the Turkish rule over Greece or the Russian rule over Eastern Armenia. To say nothing of the Turkish rule over Armenia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to the people of the languages involved to develop their scripts in an authentic way; no one else can do it for them. Latinization is a side effect of economic prosperity and a cosmopolitan youth culture; we&rsquo;ve seen too much of cures far worse than this disease to prefer nativism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>This is not to say that&rsquo;s what <em>you&rsquo;re</em> calling for, but some of us lack the imagination to see how else one would keep Korean or Japanese or X youth away from the corrupting influences of the Beatles or Elvis Presley or Britney Spears. Sure, especially with a language barrier, a vibrant local culture will mean local art - including typography - and music will find an audience, but often the most popular local artists will be those influenced by the global pop culture instead of indigenous traditions.</p>
<p>There are occasional rays of hope from that perspective, such as when a traditional Finnish folk song went viral on the Internet -</p>
<p>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rQKPijI]]</p>
<p>but the colossus that is Hollywood seems to trample all before it.</p>
<p>Well, young people want to be cool and up-to-date, and the United States, for all its flaws, has a well-deserved reputation for largely respecting personal liberty.</p>
<p>The point I&rsquo;m sort of dancing around here is this:</p>
<p>When you present a problem, real though it may be, in such a way, that one possible response is -</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that X is a problem. <em>But what the heck do you want me to do about it?</em></p>
<p>then, a lot of people, instead of replying that way, will just go a bit further&hellip; and essentially dismiss X as a problem. Basically because there are so many problems that one <em>can</em> do something about that one can&rsquo;t do enough about them all, what&rsquo;s the use of even putting X on the list of problems?</p>
<p>So in a case like that of Latinization, where no cure comes to mind that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;worse than the disease&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s really helpful to often include concrete recommendations for action to avoid getting dismissed.</p>

<p>John:
Well expressed, showing a sensitive understanding of cultural progress.
I for one am not a conservative, at least I don&rsquo;t think I am. I truly believe that the only way for a culture to survive is to adapt, including assimilating cultural colonialism. I dislike revivals of old Armenian metal type as much as I dislike all the Latinized crap from the 80s to this day. So, to be practical, what do I like? Well, I&rsquo;ve tried to make things I like, which I like because they try neither to keep Armenian in a museum nor throw out the baby with the bathwater, but to in fact keep my script vital:

<p>Even if the screen speedup is insignificant, it might save a tiny bit of battery power, which is crucial in a device that will have a tiny battery. They need the charge to last all day.</p>
<p>In the iPhone — which has a vastly larger battery — the chips are designed to save every tiny increment of battery power they can. Tiny increments add up.</p>

<p>The DIN we are talking about also has its origin in engraving/routing tech — and it being a ‘Norm’ (in good English: something you HAVE to do/use) has seen extensive use all around. There is tradition, is what I mean to say. And Apple has a history of using tradition as a starting point for its developments (Bauhaus-Ulm-Rams-iPod).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have no reason to be against reviving old Armenian metal type, simply because it seems to be, for better or worse, a starting point.</p>
<p>I remember noticing the odd forms - for the capital letter, looking like R with its vertical stroke removed, and for the small letter, like lowercase h - in some fonts for one Armenian letter before; in checking again, I came across an image of the Armenian alphabet which showed the traditional forms for the letters in print, but which showed a shape like &ldquo;h&rdquo; for both upper and lower case in handwriting. This suggests a legitimate indigenous source for this otherwise inexplicable burst of Latinization for the one letter Հ հ -</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/letter_6337.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>since the typeface here uses the Latinized form of the lower-case, I&rsquo;ve included an image for reference.</p>
<p>Since the h does seem to embody some of the key features of the authentic lowercase character, I&rsquo;m beginning to understand what you meant by</p>
<p><em>And now people lean on it as an escape from properly designing one of our trickiest glyphs.</em></p>
<p>&hellip;if what seem to be serifs on the authentic form are, in fact, critical, and the letter <em>must not</em> look like L (which is exactly what it does look like to outsiders from the Latin script community), then the h-form becomes a lazy way to ensure legibility, a way to avoid what is &ldquo;tricky&rdquo; about the original form.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Igor, exactly.</p>
<p>Bert, the historical angle might be sound, but does it justify the branding confusion?</p>
<p>John, the handwriting form of the «Հ»/«հ» you mention (which however was unlikely to have been Aramian&rsquo;s reference point, since he Latinized other letters too) has a notable loop on the ascender. If that were maintained I wouldn&rsquo;t mind as much; in fact there&rsquo;s an upcoming Armenian extension to a Very Famous Font which I consulted on where an &ldquo;elaboration&rdquo; on the ascender is the most I could convince them to do (which is still a world better than a plain &ldquo;h&rdquo; form).</p>
<p>Also, just because something is a precedent doesn&rsquo;t make it a good idea. Besides my general advice of not leaning on handwriting, I also believe in consciously deviating from dominant cultures, even if it means inventing new forms. In fact such resistance to cultural assimilation was why the Armenian script was invented!</p>
<p>BTW Latinization is not &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s very easy to explain in the context of people from smaller cultures looking up to a &ldquo;victorious&rdquo; one. Aramian was working in Constantinople in an era of looking up to the West. Most type designers everywhere are looking to that same place.</p>
<blockquote>the letter <em>must not</em> look like L</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re speaking of the capital form, most people actually don&rsquo;t see an &ldquo;L&rdquo;, because the slant is prominent. Actually the «Հ» has exhibited great variety of form over the centuries&hellip; but none of them look like an &ldquo;R&rdquo; with the left stem removed&hellip; For the lc form, lazy/impressionable designers of course just copy-paste the &ldquo;h&rdquo;.  :-/</p>

<p>These Fira fonts have a special name table with names identical to those of the system fonts. Because the font folder <code>/Library/Fonts</code> takes precedence over the fonts which are in <code>/System/Library/Fonts</code>, these specially crafted fonts are used for the user interface instead of the real system fonts.

<p>Yes, you could. This is how the various system font replacements for Yosemite work.</p>
<p>The 984 upm is not necessary. It’s the upm value of the Yosemite Helvetica UI font. On Fira Sans I also set the upm to 984 without scaling the outlines, because then the x-height is very similar to the Helvetica UI fonts. I think Apple set the upm to this value (also without changing the outlines from ordinary Neue Helvetica) to make ‘Helvetica Neue Desk UI’ appear closer to Lucida Grande in size.</p>
<p>The original San Francisco has a upm value of 2048. The person who made the system font version must have scaled it down. Also the original version is OT-CFF and not TTF. More reasons to always look at the source and not to rely on third-party downloads ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see that Chanik Aramian, Ճանիկ Արամեան, is mainly known for a famous engraving of &ldquo;Mother Armenia&rdquo; from 1861. There aren&rsquo;t enough English search results on his name to see what he attempted to do to the Armenian script.</p>
<p>But using the Armenian spelling of his name, I found this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://books.tarumian.am/Meghapart/FACES/aramian.htm">http://books.tarumian.am/Meghapart/FACES/aramian.htm</a></p>
<p>which has an illustration showing an &ldquo;h&rdquo; with a curly top for the letter in question, the other common change of տ into s (the capital form is like S), but as well, ր becomes r, which is usually <em>not</em> found, even in the more heavily Latinized faces.</p>
<p>And ց, of course, looks a lot like g even before Latinization - somewhat less so when the top part is a rectangle instead of an oval, as in the most traditional faces; similar for զ and q.</p>
<p>So I take it Aramian originated the more Latinized style of Armenian typeface which rounded off corners, to use Latin rather than Boloragir as the model - and I suspect his main goal was simply to improve legibility. The Latin script has <strong>that</strong> characteristic in abundance, after all.</p>
<p>(EDIT: From this discussion, I think I have gained some understanding of the issues with Armenian typography, at least as Hrant perceives them.</p>
<p>Basically, the traditional metal Armenian typefaces, culturally sound though they may be, were in need of some &ldquo;fresh air&rdquo;; Aramian provided that, but did so together with some gratuitous Latinization.</p>
<p>This is why it is felt that the current need is for typefaces for Armenian that are culturally authentic, but instead of following traditional models slavishly, still share some characteristics with the usual Latinized faces. Such typefaces exist, Hrant himself having designed some of them.</p>
<p>And now I think I see where the remaining problem is. There are &ldquo;good&rdquo; Armenian fonts, but they&rsquo;re not getting used much by Armenians. One possible cause is that the free fonts with Armenian support tend to be either poor-quality metal type revivals using the old coding system, or heavily Latinized ones in Unicode.</p>
<p>But money is not likely to be the big issue. Personally, I <em>had</em> found it to be an annoyance that the metal revivals weren&rsquo;t available in Unicode.</p>
<p>Instead the issue is basically this:</p>
<p>The Armenian community is divided into the diaspora, speaking Western Armenian, and the homeland, speaking Eastern Armenian. The diaspora uses the traditional orthography, the homeland is content with the changes wrought by a Soviet-era spelling reform.</p>
<p>Today, the homeland is under one of those corrupt regimes like the one Putin is invading the Ukraine to avenge. So the political winds aren&rsquo;t driving the homeland and the diaspora together. The diaspora likes its metal revivals, the homeland sees nothing out of place with overly-Latinized faces. And they can&rsquo;t read what each other writes well anyways.</p>
<p>Well, who knows what the future may bring. In five years, perhaps the Russian people will tire of isolation, and Armenia will open to the West. Maybe people making fonts for Google or Linux or even Microsoft will see the light about Armenian and tone down the Latinization. But direct progress in the Armenian community itself seems for a later day.)</p>

In 1994, in San Francisco, Albert-Jan Pool and Erik Spiekermann took a cab together from the ATypI conference to the airport. Spiekermann knew that Pool’s employer went bust, so he told him that if he wanted to earn some money with type design, he should have a look at fonts such as OCR and DIN.

<p>Lol, I guess skipping like a stone from one molehill to the next gets its little publicities. The next interesting thing about the Apple watch fonts is going to be the Arabic, Chinese and other scripts. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how that is all handled.</p>
<p>The Adobe solution, according to Dr. Lund, to make the whole damn font again with new proportions and sizing to the em, before you know which script is the dog, and which is the tail, a fact only really available from the document(s), is so 90&rsquo;s, and not very mobile friendly.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that the third leg of need, for dynamic parametric scaling, has landed.</p>

This one is off. In fact, one of the most beautifully done Simplified Chinese gothic – Hiragino Sans GB – is done by a Japanese foundry, Dainippon Screens. It is basically a Chinese version of the Japanese original, Hiragino Kaku Gothic. They totally know what they’re doing, and they’re doing it extraordinarily well enough to put Chinese foundries to shame.</div>

<p>Well, indeed. As you&rsquo;ve pointed out before, Armenia itself is an excellent example of that, as in the homeland, strongly Latinized faces are generally used because that&rsquo;s what people are used to from the Soviet years - classic Armenian faces, which you also find problematic, are mainly used in the diaspora, although I think the Latinized ones are making inroads there too, since that&rsquo;s what you get from Microsoft.</p>
<p>While I think that if Thais or Koreans or Greeks want to play around with features from other cultures and script systems, that&rsquo;s fine, as an outsider, if I were running a computer or smartphone company, I would definitely want to tread carefully in having default fonts for text use prepared for markets with other script systems.</p>
<p>I would think, as a matter of course, that it was possible that a typeface for a script system designed by people not native to it could well, for reasons to which its designers were oblivious, not look very good to its users. Playing it safe would mean going for authenticity in a conservative manner.</p>

Passports don&rsquo;t matter. Hrant&rsquo;s comment is Hrant&rsquo;s comment. People&rsquo;s work, the fonts we the people think will last a generation or more, is their &ldquo;passport&rdquo; to typographic recognition, across scripts.</p>
<p>Hrant, I was looking forward to your video, but it turned out to be (what Texans call), a &ldquo;Big Hat, No Ranch&rdquo; presentation. And, then there is your navel gazed definitions, whew! Constructively? What breaks your Apache Licensing model, is the need for sources to be available, paired with tools that can open &lsquo;em, edit &lsquo;em and rewrite &lsquo;em. You got one of those, fetch it here.</p>
<p>And if scaling is not a &ldquo;highly notable element&rdquo; of cross-script compatibility, (whatever highly notable element means, per script, per change, per reader), then why do it at all. And even then, the issue I put to you, before, and now, is not one of degree, but of the existence of Asianization, and it&rsquo;s effect on &ldquo;emenomics&rdquo;, stem weight, and ultimately, the de-optimization of Latin, and other accompanying scripts.</p>

<p>Sylfaen is somewhat Latinized (mostly in terms of serif deployment) but to be fair it was a sort of afterthought on their part, and from a previous era. I have since been commissioned to consult on their more recent and sober Armenian efforts, and it would be false modesty on my part if I didn&rsquo;t opine that that was a good move.  :-)</p>
<p>Concerning Japanese and Chinese, I think it&rsquo;s notable that the former&rsquo;s inclusion of Kanji pretty much ensures nativity in the latter. Just because two peoples generally don&rsquo;t like each other doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t make each other&rsquo;s fonts properly!</p>
<blockquote>the fonts we the people think will last a generation or more</blockquote>
<p>1: You are not the people. You are a maker and seller of Latin fonts.
2: Anyway, the conscious preference of consumers is not entirely correlated to the longevity of text fonts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the overall feedback I&rsquo;ve received from my talk. Note that it is one of only four presentations the TypeCon folk have elected to publish so far. Speaking of which, you should watch Liron&rsquo;s talk, to get an idea of what cross-script migration really means.</p>
<p>Your contention concerning the Apache license makes no sense. Did you actually watch the video? Apache fonts are no more difficult to derive from than OFL. The impediment inherent in the latter is why I&rsquo;m pushing for more people to release more Apache fonts instead of OFL.</p>
<blockquote>And if scaling is not a "highly notable element" of cross-script compatibility, (whatever highly notable element means, per script, per change, per reader), then why do it at all.</blockquote>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s an easy technical compensation.
Really, scaling a Latin font by 15% is pretty drop-dead-boring, culturally.</p>
<p>Highly notable means things like this:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/15766660099/in/pool-cross-script-letterforms">https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/15766660099/in/pool-cross-script-letterforms</a>
But also more subtle things like this:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/13764963614/in/set-72157627201383652">https://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/13764963614/in/set-72157627201383652</a></p>
<p>There are probably some cases of Latin text fonts with glyphs that have been adapted to look more like CJK, but it&rsquo;s certainly not a virulent trend in the way that the Latinization of Armenian, Thai, et alia is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very good at tending to your particular ranch. I&rsquo;ll stick to tending to the minds of free-range ranchers.</p>

That&rsquo;s not a Font. What&rsquo;s written on bathroom walls, culturally, is nice, human, cool beans with the hands and all, fir sure, but the spacing is sub primo, or is there a word space after the &ldquo;U&rdquo;. And, to work on an Apple Watch eventually, it&rsquo;ll need some other changes.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re out of touch with how designers view cultural exchange. The proof is the examples I keep throwing at you, which you pretend are not slamming your face.</p>
<p>Scaling is deeper? And 15%, which –to repeat– keeps the results well within pre-existing Latin norms? Source Han Sans is the best insight you have here? Compared to things like imposing Latin&rsquo;s x-height onto Arabic?* Nevermind that any schmuck can de-scale via the font size drop-down.</p>

<blockquote>I was seizing your chosen extraordinarily narrow topic by the throat of need</blockquote>
<p>As you have demonstrated time and again, you have zero idea what minorities need. The best evidence of that is Font Bureau&rsquo;s library.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;UMN&rdquo; is not on a bathroom wall. It&rsquo;s on a marble plaque that over the years thousands of Armenians (and notably, youngsters) have been passing by and absorbing (if typically subconsciously). It speaks to how a minority can fight assimilation by modifying the writing system of the host nation (in this case concerning contrast distribution, where Latin needs a kick in the finial*). And eventually such modifications can be taken up by people outside the minority.</p>

<p>And nit-picking spacing in this discussion about cultural exchange? You&rsquo;re arguing like a teenager. Emotions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, perhaps he meant Chinese, Japanese, and Korean - not the letters C, J, and K in the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>It is true that Japanese doesn&rsquo;t look quite the same as Chinese. Some of the Chinese characters, when used as Kanji, have simplified forms unique to Japanese. And there do tend to be some differences in taste between what is preferred in typefaces for Chinese (traditional and simplified can be counted as two separate communities here) and typefaces for Japanese.</p>
<p>As for Korean - while Chinese characters are still used in South Korea as part of the writing system (called &ldquo;hanja&rdquo;), they&rsquo;re not used <em>much</em>. The writing system was originally designed to &ldquo;look like Chinese&rdquo;, which is why their alphabetic characters are grouped into square blocks representing syllables - but they still don&rsquo;t look that much like Chinese characters.</p>
<p><cite>It speaks to how a minority can fight assimilation by modifying the writing system of the host nation (in this case concerning contrast distribution, where Latin needs a kick in the finial*).</cite></p>
<p>I doubt that high-contrast versions of the Latin alphabet are usually created by Armenians for reasons of cultural preservation. It is just ordinary type designers exaggerating it because it looks cool.</p>
<p>The stroke contrasts in typical Roman faces, I think, do serve a purpose, and shouldn&rsquo;t be deliberately suppressed at least in lighter weights. But as has been noted in discussions of Bible typefaces, Clarendons with low stroke contrast have been used in situations where the highest legibility is required.</p>
<p>And the exaggerated stroke contrast of the Didones is generally <em>not</em> considered all that good a thing, at least for text faces.</p>
<p>Since readabillity, as opposed to legibility, is harder to quantify, and less work has been done on measuring it (although, as a discussion here noted, Legros et. al. noted one tool, blink tests, that can be used for it) while there are obvious ways to modify the Latin alphabet to make it more <em>legible</em> (i.e. increase the x-height to a grotesque level), how to change it from what people are used to in order to make it more <em>readable</em> is something I would be very hesitant to speculate on.</p>

<p>From what I understand that was a sort of post-rationalization to appease the pre-existing elite. But <em>that</em> could be post-rationalization itself! :-)</p>
<blockquote>I doubt that high-contrast versions of the Latin alphabet are usually created by Armenians for reasons of cultural preservation.</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the degree of contrast that&rsquo;s notable there, it&rsquo;s that the contrast is unconventional, and most of all clearly borrows directly from Armenian convention.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, the examples you and the other guy keep throwing at me, pretend to be what I&rsquo;m talking about, but ain&rsquo;t. Who cares about Latin fonts made out of CJKish or other non-Latinic parts. That is not what I&rsquo;m concerned with, and the repeated insistence on linking to that unrelated issue is sad.</p>
<p>You were doing your anorexic dance above, I merely nearly pointed out that there are issues of global typography you don&rsquo;t seem to be processing. Take any one of those Chinese-looking Latin fonts linked to above, and try to make a Kanji at that weight. Go ahead, I dare you. Except that you and the other guy, probably still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s being discussed, much less have the facilities to test it. So I gave you some numbers, you said “voodoo”, and that&rsquo;s how you usually deal with diversity, except for yours, natch.</p>
<p>Some people won&rsquo;t deal with such ignorant intransigence, others just sit back and smile, and while many have left here to find more reasoned discourse, I&rsquo;m dedicated to making sure people know ;) So, when e.g. you start ranting about needing 1/2 dead curves, pants-on-headedly blaming the tools and font format, no one reacts much anymore. PostScript&rsquo;s Curve-To Command is too deeply ingrained, and Fontlab&rsquo;s faults are your own by freedom of selection errors by a fanboy. But you&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>Then, is it nit-picking? It seems this kind of criticism is going on somewhere in twitter, most every day&hellip; where have I seen that. On Twitter, it often reminds me of a teenager who leaves flaming bags of dog excremental at people&rsquo;s front door, forcing some poor graphic designer or founder to come stomp out the shit fire. Where have I seen that&hellip; Oh I remember, that is how “designers culturally exchange”. Not. Here is at least kindly more focused.</p>
<p>Anyway, that spacing is hugely wrong, besides not part of a discussion about Apple Watch fonts or high quality type on screens. But still, I hate to see a mix of bad execution with contrary design, in passive or even subconscious education. It rarely produces anything but confused kiddies. And if that’s what you’ve mean by “modifying the writing system”, it looks a lot more like just modifying the writing of that system, and who cares if that’s not done well and completely. What&rsquo;s the name and town of that school BTW, perhaps a diamond saw for next X-mas would be welcome.</p>

<p>Actually, the average Chinese word is two glyphs.</p>
<p>The idea that San Francisco has an unusually light weight for a Latin alphabet typeface in order to make it possible to have some (limited!) level of consistent visual identity between the (forthcoming) Chinese character typeface for the device&hellip; while also permitting the Chinese characters/Kanji/Hanja to be legible - is interesting.</p>
<p>But before commenting in any depth, I&rsquo;ll first have to see what Chinese looks like on Android devices - and present-day iPhones, for that matter. But I&rsquo;ll admit that I would have expected that visual identity across that huge gap in the natures of the scripts involved would be rather low on the list of priorities - and optimizing the Latin alphabet so as to display well on the screens available would be uppermost.</p>

<p>I did oversimplify somewhat. It depends on what kind of Chinese text you&rsquo;re considering.</p>
<p><em>Baihua</em> texts are fundamentally a transcription of spoken Chinese, in which most words are two syllables long. Each character represents a syllable, so those words will take two syllables.</p>
<p><em>Wenli</em> texts are in &ldquo;classical style&rdquo;; here, usually one character represents a word - corresponding to the first syllable, in the case of a two-syllable word. Ambiguity is avoided because there are multiple different characters for syllables with the same sound and tone, with the meaning partly indicated by the &ldquo;radical&rdquo; (more accurately, the Chinese word means &ldquo;classifier&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Also, a Chinese word generally does not contain as much meaning as two English words. Chinese does not have word prefixes or suffixes, so their functions are generally performed by additional words. Thus, in English, one says &ldquo;five books&rdquo;, in Chinese one says &ldquo;five piece book&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is <em>still</em> highly oversimplified. I don&rsquo;t speak Chinese, nor am I a Sinologist, I&rsquo;ve just read introductions to Chinese linguistics for laypersons out of interest.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re confusing vertical proportions with overall scaling, really? Because your example of Source Han Sans is the latter (and, again, by a factor well within pre-existing Latin norms). In contrast, in Source Serif the descenders are as long as the ascender (an anti-text Noordzijism), the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is shorter than the rest, and the &ldquo;f&rdquo; is longer&hellip; So artsy!</p>
<p>Now, if you could point to a case where for example Latin&rsquo;s x-height was expanded to match the greater natural apparent size of Chinese, then that would mean you&rsquo;re getting what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<blockquote>there is no curve one can't get as things are.</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s about design elegance, just like using the fewest vertices possible to get the desired shape.</p>
<blockquote>if you don't want to be followed, like dude, Twitter has a solution for that.</blockquote>
<p>I enjoy being followed, especially by people who make good fonts. It&rsquo;s just disturbing (and indicative of emotional &ldquo;drag&rdquo;) when a grown man running a nice company acts like a teenage girl or a bot. Honestly I&rsquo;d much rather believe you&rsquo;re more coolly rational than that.</p>
<p>BTW it&rsquo;s telling that I&rsquo;ve never blocked anybody, ever, anywhere. (Well, maybe once or twice, but the fact that I don&rsquo;t remember who hopefully means it was practical, not emotional.)</p>
<blockquote>I'm talking about shifts in writing systems' stylistic and proportion-bearing parameters as a function of writing systems' shifts to a new environment</blockquote>
<p>Changing proportions to suit physical constraints (that&rsquo;s all it is) is not news. And you were talking about Chinese influencing Latin, which is actually interesting (and the only reason I&rsquo;m engaging).</p>
<blockquote>I doubt the average Chinese word requires two glyphs to represent.</blockquote>
<p>It seems likely since two syllables per meaning seems to be a natural preference in humans (noting how proper names that don&rsquo;t conform as a rule get truncated, sometimes even expanded).</p>

<p>No. Most Chinese words are of two syllables, and even in the mode of writing where one character represents them, it&rsquo;s still not true that one Chinese character = two English words, not even remotely, which is what you posted. So I corrected you with a brief remark - and when you expressed doubt, I supplied more detail.</p>
<p>Brevity, not making extreme statements to get attention (the OP, after all, could contradict any whoppers I tried to tell on <em>that</em> subject) was my goal - and I do have to note that I am not appreciative of this level of incivility as well.</p>

<p>The native Latin designer knows that the world of type composing apps sees all fonts the same regardless of gross metrics, and all line lengths the same regardless of actual line length, in the single default leading of pts +20%-or-whatever % apps use. So, not many if any, native designers of Latin leave an additional 15% of space in the Em. Maybe you do that, but no native designers do… normally.</p>
<p>If Source Han Sans Latin is scaled by 15%, from Source Sans Latin, and remains in the EM Squad and its vertical proportions are unaffected, then the Latin was designed with 15% additional vertical space, contrary to the Needs of the Latin User. The other way, the Latin is designed with vertical proportions occupying all or most of the EM, and then, if it is to be Sinofied, it’s scaled x% and the extenders are brought back into the EM, changing the proportions.</p>
<p>Those are the two ways. One can Asianize the Latin before even adding it the the Chinese (yuk!?), or one can Asianize from a true Latin, if Latinizing the Chinese is not an option. Similar is true of weights, as I said above. In any case I said, “Asianization of Latin.” and most people can see what I mean. You said: “Riiight”, set own your crotch hair on fire and re-ran around screaming about anorexia and idiota etc.…</p>
<p>..and you don’t believe I’m just twitter clutzing, then I’ll lie. You are the Only member of our otherwise peaceful community who has threatened and implied the threat to use firearms against another member of our otherwise peaceful community. So, when I f/u you, I’m flashing my brights on you, for…others. That’d be a community service to our culture you can lie about for a boost.</p>
<p>QualiDude, I am so sorry. You lost your pass to free civility with umpteen, off and off-off topic paragraphs on heaven knows what, followed by an attempt to get into the conversation with,  “That was a joke, right?”, which itself was a recurring joke throughout this thread. That I, Apple, or nearly anyone here is concerned with Latin designs looking like Chinese writing for menus, vs working more like Kanji in composition on a watch, is not exactly my fault. And though there are lots of ways to count translation from Chinese to Latin, the point none argue, is that the average density of strokes per Chinese glyph is much higher than Latin, causing the weight effect, the obvious Asianization of Latin, that I’m talkin’ about.</p>

<p>Aye, I eye. You eye, not so much. Live-font-interpolation-on-the-web? Speaking of which, Apple&rsquo;s been changing  font styles in their UI to produce a typographically responsive appearance for several OS now. I&rsquo;m hoping, this first widespread use of multiple slave fonts, will lead to more interest in the use of multiple master fonts. I&rsquo;m sure the iWatch UI follows this path. It&rsquo;s complex to work out a web site this way though, unless one controls more of the software and hardware, as Apple does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(like Morison)&rdquo;
Not particularly. But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s not let the demonizing of an individual un-distract you from no actual non-problem-solving, or something like or unlike that.</p>

<p>Actually, I do have to apologize for that. I was not reading carefully, and thought that what I quoted might have actually meant that the <em>letters</em> C, J, and K, rather than Chinese characters and their Kanji and Hanja forms, were things a minority might have thought to adapt to look like each other.</p>
<p>I found one other famous quote from Stanley Morison, incidentally:</p>
<p><cite>Typography is the efficient means to an essentially utilitarian and only accidentally aesthetic end, for the enjoyment of patterns is rarely the reader’s chief aim. Therefore, any disposition of printing material which, whatever the intention, has the effect of coming between the author and the reader is wrong.</cite></p>
<p>This tends to be a truism, but it is also unsurprising that he shared the same philosophy of type as Beatrice Warde.</p>
<p>Further searching turns up</p>
<p><cite>Type design moves at the pace of the most conservative reader. The good type-designer therefore realizes that, for a new fount to be successful, it has to be so good that only very few recognize its novelty.</cite></p>

Specifically here: there is a notable overlap between people who are blind to Latinization&rsquo;s true nature and people who think Latin features an inherent superiority that should be emulated. Morison for example liked Schonfield&rsquo;s work essentially because it made Hebrew look more Latin and less Hebrew. You&rsquo;re so Latin-centric that you&rsquo;re fretting about a Chinese influence on Latin (in Apple&rsquo;s San Francisco font and elsewhere) even though there&rsquo;s no evidence.</p>
<p>The reason you might be right that coming to Granshan would be a waste of your time is that it&rsquo;s a conference about expanding cultural horizons (very much including cross-fertilization between Latin and other writing systems, but not simply leaving things to devoted Latin-mongers) as opposed to merely transferring clinical technical know-how.</p>

<p>In many ways, many Armenians (especially in Armenia proper) are very old-fashioned.

<p>However even rich Westerners who make a big mistake can redeem themselves.

<p>It is true that Kim Kardashian <em>has</em> brought the issue to public view. However, it&rsquo;s not as if her status as a celebrity lacking in substance has changed.</p>
<p>Hence, when I first saw that sentence of yours, my immediate reaction was to think that it could be interpreted in a sense you did not intend. The good news, of course, is that there are currently very few Armenians living in Asia Minor, and even though Turkey&rsquo;s ambitions to join the EU seem to have been recognized as thwarted, Ms. Kardashian&rsquo;s faults are certainly not going to be sufficient to tempt them to repeat the history they deny.</p>
<p>But regarding her as a valuable ambassador of the Armenian community&hellip; will seem to many, at the least, as a measure of that community&rsquo;s desperation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kim Kardashian gets people who would otherwise not hear about the Genocide to learn about it, and some will move on to actually care about it. Publicity. That&rsquo;s all. So more than desperation, it involves a realization that organizations, and sometimes even governments, change their behavior based on mass opinion formed via celebrity worship. Small steps, that get you closer to a destination.</p>
<p>For example George Clooney is another celebrity who exerts public pressure towards ethical political behavior. But even though he&rsquo;s probably a better person than Kim Kardashian and has actual talent that he applies, personally I still don&rsquo;t care for him beyond that usefulness. He&rsquo;s an actor. BTW his wife, Amal Clooney is now representing an Armenian Genocide case in the European Court of Human Rights. She seems to be highly qualified, but the fact that people find her relatively attractive is a bonus, because it makes more people pay more attention. Human nature, for better or worse.</p>
<p>BTW, although tensions between Armenia and Turkey (and Azerbaijan) do harm Armenia economically, we&rsquo;re not too worried about another Genocide (although some consider assimilation into larger cultures a &ldquo;white Genocide&rdquo;, something Benjamin Franklin for one was actually a fan of). We want recognition of and reparations for the events of 1915-1923. And we&rsquo;ve been making steady progress towards that, thanks in part to flawed people like Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>BTBTW, an angle on the DS baby story:

<p>This I can give you, a demonistic mistranslation has led you to demagoguery. It&rsquo;s a stupid idea, actually, to think that Morison was talking about Latin features at all, as opposed to the flexibly inherent in a small glyph repertoire capable of unlimited recombinatorializationing.

<p>&ldquo;Latinization&rsquo;s true nature&rdquo; ? There are several goals to Latinization, today, in the past, per design, and per script — if designers everywhere have the freedom to do as their readers please, that&rsquo;s best. To &ldquo;true-nature&rdquo; anything so old, complex and global is not only not best for &ldquo;cultural progress&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s approaching worst best.</p>
<p>I was answering a technical question about Latin extenders and weights, relative to their CJK font-mates. You, Hrant, are looking for other answers, reparations and entitlements I cannot give you, I just make fonts people are not supposed to notice, as opposed to a font industry &ldquo;artist&rdquo; like yourself, where notice is the most important thing.</p>

<p>Many people have praised the invention of the alphabet, because it led to universal literacy, and character-based scripts like that of Chinese have objectively lagged seriously behind in this regard. (Although I&rsquo;ve noted that speakers of English are the last ones who should be criticizing Chinese - our spelling is also a major obstacle to effective writing literacy, just as finding the right phonetic is with Chinese characters. <em>Reading</em> literacy isn&rsquo;t as hard as Westerners fear in Chinese, as a repertoire of a few hundred character components can give that.)</p>
<p>Morison did, however, name the Latin alphabet specifically. It is more legible than Hebrew or Arabic, and it&rsquo;s simpler to write than Thai or Glagolitic.</p>
<p>But has what Morison said been misinterpreted by placing it in the context of Hrant&rsquo;s concerns about the typography of other script systems being usurped, contaminated, or whatever by the typography of the Latin script?</p>
<p>Well, given that Morison&rsquo;s words were in the introduction to &ldquo;The New Hebrew Typography&rdquo;, a book by Hugh Schoenfeld, in which a reform of the Hebrew Script which amounted to Latinizing it quite thoroughly was proposed, it&rsquo;s hard for me to accuse Hrant of taking them badly out of context. He really does seem to be praising more about the Latin alphabet than what it shares with ancient Phoenician.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to read that book now, however. I see that Hugh Schoenfeld&rsquo;s motivations were honorable, and he made an effort to justify each of his letter shapes from an authentic Hebrew source.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that his example of a newspaper page in the Hebrew script is sad-looking from a typographical standpoint to eyes accustomed to what the Latin script can do - it reminds me of Chinese-language newspaper pages. But neither China nor Israel have been prevented from entering the modern age from shortcomings in their typography that <em>are</em> merely aesthetic, for all of Morison&rsquo;s denials of this.</p>
<p>And Chinese-language and Hebrew-language glossy magazines, as well, show that those scripts are not so badly hindered in this respect. Yes, they lack a lower-case with ascenders and descenders, which is advantageous for legibility&hellip; in the case of Hebrew, the ancient Phoenician script is an alternative that would remedy that, but for religious reasons, it is proscribed from use for the Tanakh (the Old Testament) - and during the long years of diaspora, the Hebrew language was often used for little else but for religous purposes, so the old alphabet fell into disuse.</p>

<blockquote>It's a stupid idea, actually, to think that Morison was talking about Latin features at all, as opposed to the flexibly inherent in a small glyph repertoire capable of unlimited recombinatorializationing.</blockquote>
<p>First of all, Hebrew&rsquo;s &ldquo;glyph repertoire&rdquo; is even more simple than Latin&rsquo;s. For one thing, surely you know that it has only one case. But most of all: have you actually seen Schonfield&rsquo;s proposals? If you haven&rsquo;t even bothered to look, that&rsquo;s a bit damning&hellip; although I guess not as damning as if you&rsquo;ve seen them but cannot discern the blatant, insensitive, inferiority-complex–driven Latinization at the heart of it. Morison certainly realized that&hellip; and loved it! Anybody free of Latin chauvinism could never allow himself to write such an introduction (or really any introduction at all) to such a work.</p>
<blockquote>were you brave enough to assault the living as you do the dead.</blockquote>
<p>Excuse me, but what planet are you on? How many times have you yourself accused me of being too aggressive to the fellow living, to the point of saying I should&rsquo;ve been banned from Typophile long ago? Brave? Holy cows are my favorite target. Check the ATypI list archives to see how I handled Massimo Vignelli when he joined. Now that he&rsquo;s dead: much less motivation to confront his anti-design ideas.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t convince people by distorting your own opinions to suit the argument.</p>
<blockquote>if designers everywhere have the freedom to do as their readers please, that's best.</blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re dreaming if you think what readers say they want is all a good designer needs to consider, and hallucinating if you think that&rsquo;s all that motivates designers. Too many designers usually make things they merely enjoy themselves. When it comes to Latinization, this might turn out harmless, or even beneficial, but in general it results in homogeneous, dominant-culture impoverishment.</p>
<blockquote>I just make fonts people are not supposed to notice</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a text font guy myself, but that&rsquo;s why I know there&rsquo;s a difference between noticing and feeling, and I think you&rsquo;re not sufficiently sensitive to the feelings of minorities. And your claim of &ldquo;answering a technical question&rdquo; does not wash, because you&rsquo;ve been talking about culture this whole time. It&rsquo;s just not working out.</p>
<p>And me? I just make fonts that try to help this world notice its cultural merits.</p>
<p>John:
I would distinguish between legibility and readability. For example I believe that Arabic does have lower legibility than Latin, but higher readability (especially when you factor in its superb suitability to a consonant-centric Semitic language). Hebrew is a different animal: its large size-on-body probably makes it quite legible, but its lack of extenders hinders its readability (as you point out).</p>
<p>Peiran:
I guess that&rsquo;s not a surprise, but it doesn&rsquo;t speak well for Apple&rsquo;s ability to remain distinctive from Android.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s <em>one</em> way to look at it.</p>
<p>Back in the old days, before cultural relativism and political correctness, people may just have assumed that the Latin script went through a more complete process of &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; than the Hebrew script, and thus that some of the things that happened to Latin on its journey from Phoenician were yet to happen to Hebrew.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say that I think the upper and lower case of the Latin script (or Cyrillic or Armenian) are better integrated than those of the Greek script, so I don&rsquo;t completely reject the notion of objective merit as applied to writing systems.</p>
<p>It did seem odd to me that Schoenfeld seemed to think that the Hebrew script had to be just about exactly like the Latin script for the Hebrew language to compete equally in the modern world. From a modern perspective, one tends to ask &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;. But at the time that book was written, non-Western scripts were still poorly served by typefounders.</p>
<p>Today, with laser printers and scads of TrueType fonts, we see abundant evidence that the typographical possibilities of Chinese and Korean, for example, are as abundant and rich as those of the Latin script&hellip; <em>even if</em> that is often due to typefaces which have borrowed heavily from Roman alphabet typefaces to the point of cultural inauthenticity. While there&rsquo;s a danger of homogenization, this is in part a result of just getting started.</p>
<p>Back in the 1930s, though, in the days of hot metal, and with limited economic resources to boot, the typical Chinese-language newspaper or magazine looked pretty uninspiring typographically. In fact, that was true in the 1960s as well.</p>
<p>The example of a Hebrew newspaper page showed that this was true at the time of Hebrew typography as well.</p>
<p>Concluding that this was due to a defect in the script itself, rather than a difference in the script&rsquo;s economic position, was a mistake <em>as we know today</em>. But hindsight is 20/20, as they say.</p>
<p>So while I agree that Schoenfeld was badly mistaken, rather than viewing him as suffering from some sort of self-abnegation or cringing subservience to European culture, I am much more inclined to see him as having made an honest mistake.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, switching cause and effect, and deducing causation from correlation, are such common errors that I think it&rsquo;s not at all difficult to think that Schonfield could have attributed the typographic shortcomings of printed Hebrew materials of his day to the wrong cause. Or it may just have been that the economic factors weren&rsquo;t something that could be changed, whereas, at least in theory, the script system could be changed.</p>
<p>The book did bill itself as being &ldquo;for a future generation&rdquo;; submitting an idea for consideration, even if it has negatives as well as positives, is not itself a harmful act.</p>
<p>Also, the book first appeared in 1932. Thus, his thinking could also have been influenced by the idea that if texts in Hebrew - or Yiddish - were less foreign-looking, this might, in some slight way, contribute to reducing the suspicion and fear with which some people regarded Jews.</p>
<p>Of course, my emotional view of his work is very different from yours. I see this book as a useless, if harmless, eccentricity that has no chance of going anywhere, so it&rsquo;s hard for me to get excited about it as an act of cultural vandalism. (In the case of Armenian, on the other hand, the trend to more Latinized typefaces, as noted in another thread here recently, was set in motion by one man seeking to &ldquo;modernize&rdquo; Armenia, so I can understand your sensitivity to such matters.)</p>

<p>Same here. It&rsquo;s a good thing to think and point out that some writing systems have done more evolving, especially when it comes to factoring in technological shifts, such as the invention of printing.</p>
<p>BTW all this has an interesting consequence: writing systems can keep improving, to me even consciously.</p>
<blockquote>But at the time that book was written, non-Western scripts were still poorly served by typefounders.</blockquote>
<p>In fact that&rsquo;s a valid sentiment that Schonfield explicitly stated in his book. He saw the pronounced skewing of Hebrew towards Latin as a way to quickly/cheaply produce a large number of new Hebrew fonts by directly mining the cornucopia of Latin designs. But to me that&rsquo;s a poor excuse for running roughshod over cultural tradition, not to mention readability. Progress is something I admire, but throwing out the baby with the bathwater not so much.</p>
<p>Was Schonfield simply being naive? We&rsquo;ll never know, but typically Latinization does involve some degree of envy (which is not a virtue).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just looking at this thread for the first time.</p>
<p>Not on the main subject of discussion, but on Hebrew, it does have one ascender (lamed) one letter that descends more (kof) and one that often does (ayin), and four descender variants used for final letters. So it does have some similarity to the latin lower case in this respect.</p>
<p>The ancient paleo-Hebrew (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet</a>) was not used after the exile in Babylonia, when the Aramaic &lsquo;square script&rsquo;, the current pen-based script was adopted from Babylonia. I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s because the old script was scratching mono-lines on clay or stone, and the technology had changed to pens and other substrata, like parchment. The old script was not forgotten, but not used except for to give an antique effect, like on coins. There were another 500+ years before the exile done by Rome, which is usually counted as &lsquo;diaspora.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yes, most but not all modern Chinese words are two syllable, like the name for China, Zhongguo. But what is a &lsquo;word&rsquo; is not as clear as in Western languages. Individual characters also have meaning, e.g. zhong = middle; guo = kingdom or country. A character—which is always one syllable—can be a word on its own, or can be part of a series of two or more characters that are used with one referent, like Zhongguo, China. There is no conjugation, grammatical modification of words, so &lsquo;word&rsquo; is not otherwise marked off grammatically, I believe. Also visually, each character is in its own square, with no extra space between a series of characters that make up one word and adjacent words.</p>

<p>It takes time to develop a culturally authentic typography for a script community, and, obviously, it would be pointless to take that time if in that time, the language it serves would become dead. Priorities are a heavy burden for some of us.</p>

<p>Interesting point. The character system only works because of no conjugation. Japanese has conjugation, and so had to add another system, Hiragana, for the conjugations. And maybe you do need the huge differentiation to have each syllable-word distinct. In the pinyin romanization, words are written with the syllables together, and spaces in between full words, as in languages using alphabets. So then the root vs word distinction becomes clear.</p>

And it’s kinda smart: basically it’s a daisy chain. You plug in that adapter and it outputs not one, but three ports: VGA, another USB-C, and the conventional USB. (And then you can plug in another USB-C adapter on that port and so on and so forth&hellip;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The good news is that the port in question is not a proprietary Apple port, it&rsquo;s the industry-standard USB type C. So people won&rsquo;t have to pay an arm and a leg for an expansion hub.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple products are more expensive, and they emphasize style over performance. That means they&rsquo;re for people who like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unfortunate is that the rest of us are stuck with Microsoft Windows as pretty much our only other choice - although some people can manage with just an Android tablet instead of a computer, and there&rsquo;s always Linux, and then there are even Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The existence of the Macintosh as another choice for a few isn&rsquo;t the problem; the problem is that Apple didn&rsquo;t choose to make it a viable choice for more potential users. You can&rsquo;t really choose to dial down the bling and dial up the price/performance and still get a Mac. So the Macintosh isn&rsquo;t doing as much to keep Microsoft honest as it might.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sad is that the Atari ST and the Amiga aren&rsquo;t still out there going strong giving fierce competition to Microsoft and Intel. But it&rsquo;s far too late to do anything about that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Personally, I tended to think of Apple and Microsoft both as being the bad big guys who prevented little guys like the Atari ST, the Amiga, and Linux from gaining a foothold. Apple even sued <em>Xerox</em> when they attempted to bring out a commercial computer with a GUI, which, of course, is highly ironic. I still see them both as &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; to an extent, despite the fact that they&rsquo;ve both also done good things for the consumer - Microsoft, with Windows 3.1, made the GUI affordable, and Apple keeps Microsoft honest as well as having, at least in the past, supplied a constant pressure to innovate.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t Microsoft&rsquo;s <em>fault</em> that people see the value of a computer being the applications it can run, and that developers will gravitate to the most popular platform to get the most reward for their efforts. (Of course, if they&rsquo;re just producing a standard type of application, and so can only hope for a tiny share of its market, then developing for the Macintosh can yield better returns; but the logic strongly applies to new and unique applications.)</p>
<p>They just took advantage of gaining a favorable position, and worked hard to maintain it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that in itself; some doubts have been expressed about some of their tactics, but nothing questionable has played a significant role in Microsoft&rsquo;s dominance.</p>

Apple clearly seem determined that even if they&rsquo;ve given SF away as freeware, it will not be used for any purpose but Apple Watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the most exciting font (and the name is really dull), but I find its existence very exciting. The fact that Apple is willing to put together a font with optical styles shows that they understand what modern font design entails and have the people to put it together. I&rsquo;d say it would make sense as the new OS X/iOS system font, but I think they seem to like the idea of Helvetica in that role too much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable for Apple to avoid using the Android fonts for their watches. And a watch has a smaller screen than a smartphone. So despite the high resolution of the screen being used, designing a special font for higher legibility makes sense.</p>
<p>However, from a technical viewpoint, designing a font with vertical lines like DIN for such a purpose only makes sense if it&rsquo;s bitmapped. If it&rsquo;s instead a vector font that will be used in many different sizes, often the verticals will go down the middle of a pixel (absent <em>hinting</em>) and that would not produce an ideal result.</p>
<p>However, of course hinting <em>is</em> provided with the common vector font formats. And the font is also being chiefly used by the operating system in a standard size. So they could design a vector font around the grid of its most common display size, and rely on hinting to make the results reasonable when it is occasionally used at other sizes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that using Garamond, like the example provided earlier in this thread, is reasonable for smartphones and the like. A serif typeface with a larger x-height might be reasonable, but &ldquo;unadorned&rdquo; and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; occupy the desired mindspace at the moment for labels and menus on computing devices. But if vertical lines were bad - if one didn&rsquo;t have hinting - that doesn&rsquo;t mean there are no choices. While Optima didn&rsquo;t go well with laser printers, with anti-aliasing as well as tiny pixels, it might do well enough on a smartphone&hellip;</p>

<p>Afraid, no, I just think it&rsquo;s hugely cowardly to confront the dead. It&rsquo;s easy though. Did you ever in your life have to put together a corporate ID, before Postscript, where it took 150 fonts to get Helvetica Medium to appear everywhere from plastic cups and fabric, to print and the sides of planes. I can&rsquo;t even imagine how clueless one would have to be to not respect successful graphic designers of the 60&rsquo;s, 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s, and their font choices.</p>
<p>HP: And stop stalking me on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hugely pathetic to cry stalker on twitter as you stand hair aflame in public. You understand Twitter, and reject email for obvious reasons. Besides, it entertains me to read. If you want me to drop in and &ldquo;Call Bull&rdquo; before an avalanche hurts someone, no probdude.</p>
<p>HP: * My memory seems fine BTW.</p>
<p>Well, then the difference between Han Source Sans and Source Sans    is NOT an insignificant triviality, as you said, (then forgot, then remembered?), but an important element to the future of multi-script type design in a responsive world, as I said.</p>

I can&rsquo;t even imagine how clueless one would have to be to not respect successful graphic designers of the 60&rsquo;s, 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s, and their font choices.</cite></p>
<p>I think that <em>most</em> of the people throwing bricks at Helvetica today realize, and acknowledge, that Helvetica was a good, even revolutionary, typeface at the time of its initial introduction and greatest popularity.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re criticizing it for the same reason as they criticize Times Roman, or even Papyrus. It is a good typeface, but it is overused, and it&rsquo;s time to move on to other choices for the sake of being original.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t know that I agree with this viewpoint. I think that the best reason for a new typeface is to fill a need better - however slightly - than it is filled by existing typefaces. Of course, as an artistic endeavour, typography and type design are also subject to changing fashions. Thus, the type designer has to avoid what seems hopelessly dated.</p>
<p>Cheltenham is dated. Neither Helvetica nor Times Roman appear dated to most of the general public. Today&rsquo;s currently popular faces, like Stone Sans or like FF Olsen, may well end up looking dated in another 20 years from now.</p>
<p>So I view the greatest typographical accomplishment as taking the existing stock of timeless typefaces - like, say, Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni - and adding to that stock with Goudy Old Style, Futura, Times Roman, and Helvetica among others.</p>
<p>If, through study of Baskerville, Century Expanded, and Corona, someone can come closer to the Platonic ideal of a generic invisible text typeface, I will applaud. If they keep type designers employed through a strategem analogous to moving the hemline up and down, I will not be particularly interested - and <em>yet</em>, out of the turbulent search for new display typefaces, out of the pursuit of novelty, things do come that were valid.</p>
<p>Times Roman, after all, definitely <em>was</em> novel in its day; it still looked fresh and new in the 1960s, compared to Baskerville, Caledonia, Century Expanded, or even faces like Corona, Aurora, or Textype, which were highly legible, reasonably readable, and pretty much invisible.</p>
<p>Times Roman was distinctive enough that it, therefore, <em>failed</em> the &ldquo;crystal goblet&rdquo; test. And yet, in my opinion, its merit is enough to make it the next Caslon - that is, I think that typographers can look forward to it being &ldquo;overused&rdquo; for another hundred years or more.</p>
<p>But my extreme partiality for typographic conservatism notwithstanding, cycles and revivals have had a big part in the history of typefaces. So if Helvetica falls out of fashion, among the available options will be revivals of Venus and News Gothic. They will look fresh against a backdrop of Helvetica, and Helvetica will look fresh against them as a backdrop. There&rsquo;ll probably be room for Futura in there somewhere - as well as for new contemporary designs, <em>and</em> for Akzidenz Grotesk as well.</p>

A good sign, assuming they&rsquo;re not using &ldquo;harmonization&rdquo; too dogmatically. And I hope they don&rsquo;t expect one person to be able to personally resolve too many non-Latin scripts, and instead will be willing to also commission consultants as needed.</p>

<p>However well-made and engineered it might be, if the company sees its mission as taking consumers for what the market will bear, and presumably later on, in line with their previous practice, using well-crafted patents to hobble its competition from doing obvious things that the technology wasn&rsquo;t ready for doing at a reasonable price for them to do those things before Apple, I find it of little interest.</p>
