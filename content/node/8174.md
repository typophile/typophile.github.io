  body: 'There&#39;s another digital font based on Hellenic Wide called Biggen, which
    is readily &#40;though I suspect illegally&#41; downloadable from the web. I don&#39;t
    know of a legit source for it. <BR> <BR>One &#40;very dodgy looking&#41; site
    that has it for download includes the following copyright notice, presumably extracted
    from the font file: <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>The
