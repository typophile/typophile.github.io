  designed Palatino for [[D. Stempel AG]] 1948\u20131950. The design proved successful,
  and the type grew into a family. Palatino, which was originally designed for hand
  setting, was quickly adapted for mechanical composition on the [[Linotype Machine]].\r\n\r\nThe
  following relatives were all designed by Zapf in the 1950s for Stempel:\r\n[[Aldus]]
  is a version of Palatino optimized for the smaller sizes of text used in book settings.\r\n\r\n[[Michelangelo]]
  is an all-caps titling face, lighter and more graceful than the original Palatino's
  alphabet.\r\n\r\n[[Phidias Greek]] is an all-cap Greek alphabet that corresponds
  with Michelangelo.\r\n\r\n[[Sistina]] is a second all-caps titling face, much more
  heavy and sturdy than Michelangelo. More like the caps in Palatino Bold.\r\n\r\nDuring
  the 1960s, the members of the Palatino family were all adapted for Photo-typesetting
  machines. The world-wide popularity of Palatino's design led to fragrant piracy;
  many foundries made their own Palatinos, most of which were drawn without the permission
  of Hermann Zapf, Stempel, or [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s, a family of
  [[PostScript Type 1]] fonts for Palatino were produced. These were distributed by
  Linotype, [[Adobe]], and their partners, and were included with many [[PostScript]]
  printers. Thus Palatino probably reached the height of its distribution.\r\n\r\nIn
  1999, Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and [[Microsoft]], creating [[Palatino
  Linotype]]. The four OpenType fonts in the Palatino Linotype family each include
  1325 glyphs, supporting the following code pages:\r\n\r\n1252 Latin 1\r\n1250 Latin
  2 Eastern\r\n1251 Cyrillic\r\n1253 Greek with polytonic Greek\r\n1254 Turkish\r\n1257
  Windows Baltic\r\n1258 Windows Vietnamese\r\n\r\nThe fonts also include many different
  sets of figures, ligatures, and historical ligatures.\r\n\r\nPalatino Linotype was
  a grand foray into the possibilities of OpenType, but it did not include the entire
  scope and possibilities of the original metal Palatino family. Around 2003, Hermann
  Zapf began working with [[Akira Kobayashi]], artistic director at Linotype, on [[Palatino
  nova]]. This OpenType family would go on to include the following elements:\r\n\r\nPalatino
  nova Light\r\nPalatino nova Light Italic\r\nPalatino nova Roman\r\nPalatino nova
  Italic\r\nPalatino nova Medium\r\nPalatino nova Medium Italic\r\nPalatino nova Bold\r\nPalatino
  nova Bold Italic\r\nPalatino nova Titling (i.e., Michelangelo and Phidias Greek)\r\nPalatino
  nova Imperial (i.e., Sistina)\r\nAldus nova Book\r\nAldus nova Book Italic\r\nAldus
  nova Bold\r\nAldus nova Bold Italic\r\n\r\nAll fonts (except the two titling variants)
  contain complete Western and CE character sets. Palatino nova Roman, Palatino nova
  Italic, Palatino nova Bold, and Palatino nova Bold Italic also contain Greek and
  Cyrillic character sets.\r\n\r\nIn January 2007, Linotype released [[Palatino Sans]]
  and [[Palatino Sans Informal]], two new sans serif typeface familes designed by
  Zapf and Kobayashi."
