  body: hmmm.. the M didn&#39;t work as upside down W... <BR>Made it a bit less uppy,
    but still. Highly technical wording. <BR>changed lc &#39;v&#39;. It does work
    better. <BR>Emboldened font, as a kind of pretty lettering style. Not intended
    to be used as the bold variant. What do you think? <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1007.gif"

  body: ' The double-el is actually a part of the Spanish alphabet. The only other
    letter to double in Spanish is the &#34;r&#34; - but that doesn&#39;t get its
    own slot for some reason - maybe because the double-el is &#40;or at least can
    be&#41; pronounced quite differently that just two els. The third very common
    letter-pair in Spanish is the &#34;ch&#34; &#40;which normally gets its own slot
    in most dictionaries and such, I believe&#41;, and that also has its own sound,
    but maybe doesn&#39;t get an alphabetic slot because it&#39;s made up of two different
    letters? Language is like women. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' I am thinking of making this specially hinted truetype font freeware, but
    with a sort of free license so I could see who was using my font. Is this practical?
    I have already started using the font on my webpage and in my flash applications,
    but I would like to see it used more. However, I would not like to see it go the
    way of some of my flash games which have &#40;for want of a better word&#41; been
    stolen and used on other sites without my permission &#40;I have learnt to safe-guard
    my flash work, but fonts are not so easy&#41;. <BR>Comments welcome. <BR>Matthew

    <BR>What you might consider is handing out a bonus &#40;like maybe a higher-end
    version of the font&#41; for people who register. But of course that version will
    become pirated too - just less. <BR> <BR>hhp '
