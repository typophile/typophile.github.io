  me.\r\n\r\nI've created several fonts using Fontlab Studio 5.0.2 (yes I know it's
  a old version, but I can't update my OS yet at the moment). :(\r\n\r\nI actually
  have someone else do the kerning and OTFeatures for me.\r\nWhen they send them back
  to me they work fine, but like any font designer, I often tweak the font.\r\n\r\nEvery
  time I change anything and save it as a TTF or an OTF, then all the features don't
  work in Illustrator, photoshop, and none of them ever upload to Word.\r\n\r\nWhat
  am I doing wrong?\r\nHave I got something in FONT INFO set wrong?\r\n\r\nI could
  send you the font, if you think you know the answer.\r\n"

  body: "Most likely the other person is using a newer version of FontLab Studio,
    yes?\r\n\r\nI strongly suspect it has to do with changes in how FontLab handles
    OpenType layout code, due to changes in the underlying Adobe compiler used by
    FontLab. FontLab Studio 5.1+ use AFDKO 2.5, whereas 5.0.2 is using AFDKO version
    1.6 or earlier.\r\n\r\nOf course, the newer version of the app can try to do intelligent
    things in opening older files, but the old version can't know what changes would
    be made later.\r\n\r\nSee Adam Twardoch's post on the subject: http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=8278.0"
