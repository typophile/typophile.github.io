body: "Hi, I am trying to create a series on fonts that can be used for childrens
  handwriting practice.\r\n\r\nI need the fonts to appear layered when used in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI
  am using FontLab and have created 3 separate fonts with the same metrics. One font
  is handwriting and the other two are guidelines.\r\n\r\nAfter generating the fonts
  and loading on the computer, each font is out of step with the other on the vertical
  position.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why this is happening? Is it Fontlab or is it
  Illustrator?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    have FontLab calculating them for you automatically, which is not a good idea
    in this case."

    having a problem with one of the fonts, but this appears to be an Illustrator
    issue, it only sits in the right place if the fonts are mixed within the same
    text box. If a single font is in a text box it jumps..."

  body: "I did check the leading, so its not that. Illustrator seems to seems to push
    the character (which is a square) to the top of the text box.\r\n\r\nI have decided
    to try things a different way now, as it not crucial all of the fonts are layered.\r\n\r\nBut
    thanks all for your help, much appreciated and I have learnt something new in
    FontLab!"
