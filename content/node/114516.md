body: "The incredibly sad news continues this week. \r\n\r\nYesterday (February 25,
  2014), Emil Yakupov has passed away. His heart stopped after his regular sports
  exercise. He was 56. \r\n\r\nTogether with Vladimir Yefimov (who had died almost
  exactly two years ago), Emil co-founded ParaType in 1998, a company that not only
  revolutionized the Cyrillic typeface world but was instrumental in building a bridge
  between the Russian typographic culture and the rest of the world. More than anybody
  else, Emil was the architect and tireless upholder of that bridge. Under Emil, ParaType
  has published hundreds of original Cyrillic typefaces and digital revivals of classic
  Russian and Soviet typeface designs. \r\n\r\nBut perhaps more importantly, it was
  Emil who has created vital business relationships with Bitstream, ITC, Linotype,
  Monotype, FontShop and many other font foundries. As a result of this relationship,
  numerous major Western font families have received high-quality Cyrillic companions,
  and were introduced to millions of users in Russia. It was Emil, Vladimir and the
  rest of the ParaType team who have greatly contributed to the transformation of
  the visual culture in the Cyrillic-writing world. \r\n\r\nEmil was also instrumental
  in introducing me to Russia. I first met him at the ATypI 1998 conference in Lyon.
  He gave me the \u201Cbig ParaType font catalog\u201D, which to me was a revelation.
  After browsing it, I \u201Cgot\u201D Cyrillic. I understood how it works, and fell
  in love in it. I would later spend hours looking at the catalog, and the ParaType
  fonts. \r\n\r\nAt the same conference, I also met Yuri Yarmola, now my co-conspirator
  at Fontlab Ltd., and a friend of Emil\u2019s. Looking at the photo from Lyon 1998,
  I\u2019m now surprised how little Emil changed over the last 16 years. When I last
  saw him in Amsterdam five months ago, he had the same energy. \r\n\r\nEmil has introduced
  me to other Russian type designers. I visited the ParaType offices in Moscow a few
  times, and was always met with great hospitality. At all the type conferences over
  the years, I always sat down with Emil, and we talked \u2014 about typography mostly,
  but also about family. \r\n\r\nEmil was a quiet, wise, kind and incredibly modest
  man equipped with a cheeky smile and subtle dry wit. He put tremendous personal
  efforts into publications created by ParaType and events organized by his company
  \u2014 these efforts were always about culture rather than pure business. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
  we were not very close friends, but he was one of my mentors. And a person I could
  always count and rely on. \r\n\r\nI am incredibly sad that he is no longer among
  us. \u041F\u0440\u043E\u0449\u0430\u0439, \u042D\u043C\u0438\u043B\u044C.\r\n\r\n\u2014
