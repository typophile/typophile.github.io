    12 weeks. It won't be ready for release in that time, but you'll be pretty close!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the recommendation James."

  body: A shame that it's canceled. More type courses are welcome in what is a very
    monopolized sector of design education.

  body: "Monopolized? There are schools all over the place adding type-design education.
    They're usually only a course within other programs, but it's enough to give a
    head start. True, it's too bad that there aren't more opportunities available,
    but I think the challenge is that the opportunities are spread a little too far
    and wide rather than being monopolized.\r\n\r\nJames, it's a real shame your class
    was cancelled. Does SVA do much to promote individual courses like yours, or do
    they leave that up to you?"
