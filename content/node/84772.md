  you can see from the image, it is quite distinct. I am unsure if it is an actual
  font as the artist may have embellished it. I am looking for this font or another
  sufficiently close enough to be able to produce a new tattoo artwork from it.\r\n\r\nPlease
  excuse the quality, it is actually a picture of someone's wrist.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n\r\nRSVP"
