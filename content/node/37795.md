  body: If it is not handlettered it's modified after being set. Look at the displaced
    "i-dot"...

  body: I just received a lovely note from the founder/CEO of this company confirming
    that it is her handwriting on these labels and not a font. She said she receives
    a lot of calls asking for the name of the font. A colleague of hers tipped her
    off to this thread.
