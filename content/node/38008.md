  body: 'I doubt they are FONTS at all : these kinds of certificates, diplomas, etc.
    were more often than not printed by lithography, which means the whole thing could
    have been hand-lettered (the title set on a curve would have been damn difficult
    to do using metal type, obviously).'

    that might lead you in the right direction.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropCD.html\r\n\r\nThe
    headings in your sample are typical of journeyman engraver's work common up until
    the 1960's. Since it was government issued, the work was probably done by one
    of the many government printing offices.\r\n\r\n"
