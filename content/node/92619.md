  anyone but myself.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to buy 5 licenses of a font I've created,
  \r\nhow do I supply that? After payment, do I send the font\r\nwith a EULA that
  specifically mentions how many licenses \r\nare included for their specific purchase?
  Or is it the font file, \r\nthe standard EULA, and # of licenses included  only
  on the receipt?"

    on its own: mostly with a lot of help. But you get the basic idea\u2026"
