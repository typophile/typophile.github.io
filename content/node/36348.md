body: "Hey gang - I LOVE \"Good OT\" - but it has no italics that I can see. does
  anyone know of a very similar - modern and smooth ace like this one?\r\nI have searched
  high and low - without success.\r\n\r\nIn particular I'm loving the Sentence case.
  Lower case \"g\" and \"a\" \"y\". plus the \"d\" and \"b\" are sweet - but its hard
  to find something close to this.\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI'll paste
  an image"

    has an italic.\r\n\r\nBut an even nicer choice in my opinion would be Halvorsen."

    which I like too, is actually not as \"modern\" as some sans serifs. It's based
    on the grotesque form which is sort of solid and rugged, but not so modern. I
    can tell you that italics are in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile you could think
    about a sans like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Paralucent\">Paralucent</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/spiegel/\">Spiegel</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Antenna\">Antenna</a>."

  body: malbright - Halversen is in another category altogether, designed in fact
    in response to rigid, Germanic sans serifs. I think it has some nice ideas, but
    some of the kinks and curves are poorly executed. In that soft, warm, more Iberian
    category I prefer <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/lisboa_sans/">Lisboa</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emtype/relato_sans_ot_family/">Relato</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Megano%20OT">FF Megano</a>.

  body: FF Good Italics are being developed at [[FontShop]] (the makers of FontFonts).
    I don't have a release date though, so it probably won't affect your current project.
