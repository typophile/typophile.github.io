  font (used on an 80s portuguese tv show).\r\nThe letters aren't even the same so
  this is probably all handwritten - but I'm desperately looking for something like
  this.\r\n\r\nThe words are cut - it read 'ora' and 'olha' (the complete words would
  be 'agora escolha').\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
