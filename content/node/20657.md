body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone can reccommend a few good masculine
  scripts? It will be used as a main graphic element in a beer label design.\r\n\r\nAt
  the moment Ariston is most suited to what i need, but will need some alteration
  and detailing. (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ariston-bq/)\r\n\r\nPossible
  characteristics would include, a solid feel, without rounded or bubbly edges, distinctive
  set of uppercase with flouishes, thins not too thin! \r\n\r\nAny help would be much
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nsarah"
