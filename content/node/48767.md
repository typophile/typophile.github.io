body: "Hi,\r\nThis may be a simple question but I can't seem to figure out an elegant/simple
  solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nI am designing a large poster with one side that
  holds a fair bit of text so a grid/column layout will be necessary.\r\n\r\nIt will
  be folded across into four sections. So - I thought that setting up the columns
  would just be a matter of setting the gutter equal to the margins, but evidently
  this doesn't work because the outer 'sections' are narrower than the inner 'sections'
  due to the margins?\r\n\r\nI am thinking I should evidently try to avoid having
  text set horizontally over folds (especially large amounts of small copy).\r\n\r\nI'm
  wondering what kind of solutions people have come up with to setting text in a page
  that folds as it seems that even gutters across folds are impossible unless they
  are unusually wide (twice the margin), or the margins are unusually narrow?\r\n\r\n(Am
  I making any sense at all or am I too tired?)\r\n\r\nI've attached an image for
  reference...\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance,\r\nAlan\r\n\r\nEDIT: I am starting
  to think the answer is simply \"Draw the guides manually\"."

  body: I'm guessing the pink lines are where the folds will be? I could see adjusting
    the column widths in the outside sections so that they would be equal to each
    other (but different than the column widths of the inside sections). This sort
    of thing would depend on how big/wide the columns are. I could see how this could
    lead to the outside columns looking "wrong" if the difference isn't enough.

  body: "Yes it's a bit confusing because unless the outer margins are adjusted almost
    as tightly as the gutter, then the gutter won't be centered on the folds of the
    paper. Otherwise, it seems like uneven columns is the only solution - which wouldn't
    be a problem if there were more dynamic variation in the text (different content
    might take a different column width), but alas it is almost an entire page of
    the same kind of content without any varying hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI've attached another
    image showing the difference. The outer columns will always be narrower I suppose,
    maybe it isn't as odd as I'm thinking it is to have varying gutters or column
    widths? I suppose I'm just wondering if there is some sort of rule of thumb for
    this kind of thing because I feel like I am over-thinking this.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gridq2_4081.gif]"
