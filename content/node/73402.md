  have tried WhatTheFont and manually searching Myfonts and dafont.com but I have
  had no success.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognise it?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Tom-\r\n\r\nI don't know, looking at the texture of the C, H and K, I'm
    thinking it's not a font. It looks as if the texture has more graded elements
    than if it were just black and white, and digital type is defined by lines - it
    has no capability for anything but opaque or not opaque. Do you have any more
    info on the source? Where did you find it? Do you have any other samples?\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    photoshopped that image so the sample I presented will be slightly different but
    you get the general idea."

  body: "Do you know what the printing method of this image was? It could be a screenprint,
    woodcut or linocut but it might just be a digital simulation of such a process.
    Any of those could cause some distorion to what might actually be a hard-edged
    typeface but which might not necessarily be a digital font.\r\n\r\nThe name of
    the artist might be a help too."

    was attached, I fell in love with the font and would love to know what it is.\r\n\r\nI
    have been trying to track down the artist but no luck so far..."

    letterpress printed alphabet image and not a font? What do you think?"
