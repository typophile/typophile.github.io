body: This site doesn't remember my login all the time so sometimes I'll be reading
  a discussion and want to comment, only to realize I'm not logged in. If I then click
  the LOGIN button and login, I'm taken to my profile. That's not terribly useful.
  Could we set it up so that after login I'm redirected back to the page I came from
  so I can then comment?

  body: If you login from the sidebar while browsing the forum, it doesn't take you
    to your profile. Unfortunately, I've been having the problem that when I view
    a thread, then go back to the forum page, I'm logged out. If I refresh, I'm logged
    in. I don't understand why. (Safari 2.0.3, Mac OS 10.4.4)

  body: odd, so both logins do different things? OK, well, good to know that I can
    use the side bar (I always forget it's there since it's cut off in my browser).
