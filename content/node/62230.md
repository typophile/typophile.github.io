    are used in association with his work.\r\nI don't know if this exactly qualifies
    but he did design signage for the Toronto-Dominion Centre. Wickipedia states:
    \"Even signage graphics were restricted to only white backlit letters within a
    black aluminum panel, and only in the specific font that Mies had designed for
    the T-D Centre.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    some faces in the De Stijl journals - Theo van Doesberg. Kinda similar philosophies.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    the Bauhaus works incorporate those ideals. Might be a place to start. and as
    the learned gentleman above says, building signage is a good place to look for
    an architects type discipline.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think van de Rohe would have
    been a fan of Futura."
