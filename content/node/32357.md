body: I'd appreciate if you could please tell me which are the most useful "string"
  to perform a dynamic search in Google, e.g. <em>site:typophile.com</em>, or what
  happen if I use the "quotes" ?

  body: "If you use the quotes on a pair of words for example \"humanist Gill\" you
    will get substantially different returns to [humanist gill], in fact the brackets
    made no difference to not having them. The key, I think, is that the quotes will
    produce results where those words follow each other, albeit including between
    them any of the terms and short common words that google ignores like punctuation
    and of, and, the.\r\n\r\nTim"

    that into your address bar and then bookmark it. This is something which Grant
    Hutchinson made a while back. Smooth as silk."

  body: "This is one I have written and it works on any site. You can select text
    from any page. When you press the 'search' button it will prompt you to type in
    a phrase, with the selected text already in the box. Just press 'OK' and a new
    window will open with Google search results.\r\n\r\n<code>javascript:void(function()%20{%20var%20href%20=%20window.location.hostname;\r\n%20var%20query%20=%20prompt('Enter%20a%20search%20phrase:',%20window.getSelection());\r\n%20if(!query)%20{%20return%20false;%20}%20window.open('http://www.google.com/search?q=site:'+href+'+'+encodeURIComponent(query));%20}());</code>\r\n\r\nIf
    you prefer to stay in the same window however, use this one:\r\n\r\n<code>javascript:void(function()%20{%20var%20href%20=%20window.location.hostname;\r\n%20var%20query%20=%20prompt('Enter%20a%20search%20phrase:',%20window.getSelection());\r\n%20if(!query)%20{%20return%20false;%20}%20window.location.href%20=%20'http://www.google.com/search?q=site:'+href+'+'+encodeURIComponent(query);%20}());</code>\r\n\r\nCopy
    to a text file and make sure it is all on one line. Then simply bookmark it. Tested
    on Mac (Safari, Omniweb & Firefox)."
