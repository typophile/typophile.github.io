  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Times Roman, the typeface of the Liberal Party, went down to a substantial defeat in the Canadian general election yesterday.
The NDP&rsquo;s Dax (albeit often doctored) made unprecedented gains, but the eventual winner was not a typeface per se, but a typographic logo, the Conservative &ldquo;Möbius C&rdquo;.

<p>The Liberal sign is too clever by half. Making the acute accent of Libéral serve double-duty as the stem of a maple leaf gives an unfortunate sense of motion, as if the leaf is about to blow away in the wind like Michael Ignatieff’s political career.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Green Party was using a sunflower as its logo before BP&rsquo;s greenwash design.
However, the present stylized version was made after BP&rsquo;s floral device—which is totally f***ing stupid.
You&rsquo;d think the designer would know better, or someone signing off would have twigged.
One more reason to despair for humanity.</p>

<p>Re. the acute stem: this defunct airline logo was clever, with the chevron doing bilingual duty as both &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo;:

<p>I predict Justin Trudeau for Canada&rsquo;s next Prime Minister in 2015, leader of the LDP.
That party (a merger of the Liberals and NDP) better have a good logo!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick: <em>a merger of the Liberals and NDP</em></p>
<p>Both unlikely and unwelcome, I think. The mainstream press in Canada is busy trying to paint the election outcome in terms of Conservatives and NDP moving towards the centre, squeezing out the Liberals. But the NDP moved towards the centre a long time ago, and it made no difference to their political fortunes prior to this election. Harper&rsquo;s Conservatives were found in contempt of parliament for failing to disclose spending to enable the state to lock up more Canadians and conduct air strikes on more foreigners, hardly centrist policies. Everyone I&rsquo;ve talked to since the election thinks Canada has taken a step towards much greater polarity, and the Liberals got slaughtered at the polls not because the Conservatives and NDP had moved onto the centrist turf but because the centre has been evacuated by the electorate. I don&rsquo;t get any sense that people who oppose the Conservative policies for the country want the NDP to be centrists taking over Liberal positions. I heard <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWn6hfd7Uk">Tommy Douglas</a>’ name mentioned more times during this campaign than in any recent election. I suspect a great many people who voted NDP in this election are already somewhere to the left of the party, especially in Quebec and out here.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right about the Canadia/en Airlines logo. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I could see Justin Trudeau leading a resurgent Liberal party in the next election. If, however, there were a merger of the Liberal party with the NDP under present circumstances, the result would be led by Jack Layton - for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Then, after Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s term as Liberal leader ends - perhaps after only a few years if the resurgent Liberals fail to defeat Harper, the race will perhaps be between Bob Rae and Belinda Stronach - whoever wins, Liberal fortunes will decline again (even if not quite so precipitously), and so there will be another Liberal leadership convention.</p>
<p>If the Liberals utterly fail to regain ground in Quebec under Justin Trudeau - or whoever their next leader may be - then being subsumed into the NDP is possible. But I would not bet money on that.</p>
