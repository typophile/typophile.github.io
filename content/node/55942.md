body: "As it gets closer and closer to graduation time, I'm getting more and more
  anxious. As much as I want to be done with school, there's still a lot of work that
  still needs to be done. A website, for example, is my main concern these days. I'm
  not that experienced, so I want a unique website that remains simple. Looking at
  what is out there, I came across this website. I think its Flash based, but then
  again what do I know. But I've done stuff like this a few years ago so it shouldn't
  be too hard to do. The home page is a picture of a shed and when you move your mouse
  over the door it opens and you click to go inside. Once inside, there is one image
  with several hotspots that lead you to other areas. My roommate calls me John Nash
  because of the mess on the table in my room that I use for all my projects. I have
  a lot of art materials and not enough space, so they're usually just thrown wherever.
  So I figure I can just use an image of that table as the home page and then go from
  there.\r\n\r\n"
