<p>1475 Nicholas Jenson</p>
<p>I need a better sample to begin to take this seriously but it has piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Part of why I think it&rsquo;s possible is that he is thought to have trained in Mainz, and knew the type of  Johann and Wendelin of Speyer (de Spira), and Sweynheym &amp; Pannartz&rsquo;s  Subaico.</p>
<p>( RE: Subaico <a href="http://typophile.com/node/43615">http://typophile.com/node/43615</a> )</p>
<p>It would be great to be sure about this. Does anybody have any high-rez images? Or suggestions?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’ll call and check about on viewing incunabula, but the LOC is usually pretty cool about letting people handle rare books in the Jefferson reading room. Armed guards search anyone going in or out, and it’s usually only got a few visitors. They’ve let me take a camera in before, but there are a few downsides: no flash, and the room one can shoot in has fluorescent lights. I’ll have to borrow a much nicer camera for this, of course. If I’m really lucky I can talk someone there into doing a photo for us!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, that would be uber-cool! I would suggest a point &amp; shoot of recent vintage with a macro (often using flower as a symbol) feature. The one I have can be pretty remarkable. And learn how to to make SURE the flash doesn&rsquo;t go off. Of course an SLR with a tripod can be even better but that can be tricky to learn if you don&rsquo;t own it already. And the tripod needs to be a little above average to allow for shooting down. Time frame wise, any time this month would be great! I would want to use the image for TypeCon.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it the case that all the Jenson punches are missing? I will have to check on that&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little tricky to discern which differences may be due to design intention and which to printing exigencies. The differences here are subtle.</p>
<p>What strikes me is the relative consistency of the majority of the glyph between the two versions, as shown by your overlay. A couple of thoughts occur to me &ndash; pure speculation and probably completely fanciful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the wide punch was cut and the matrix struck; and then the punch was reworked, trimming the upper terminal, and a new matrix struck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the very least, I can imagine that the same counterpunch would have been utilized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps it is all in our imagination and the one that seems narrower has simply worn down at the top.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose you&rsquo;ve examined this closely enough to clearly identify a pattern of narrow variants and can rule out number three.</p>

<p>He also sent me this which I have altered to show what I think is the same pattern. It&rsquo;s also not conclusive but to my eye it continues the pattern.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One of the finest printers of the 20th century, he was allowed to recast Bodoni’s types from the original punches/matrices which he used to set the text of the first books from his own letterpress studio/publishing house, the Officina Bodoni. He then designed his own typefaces, cut by the great Charles Malin. Try to find specimens of Mardersteig’s Griffo, Dante, Zeno, Fontana, Pacioli, etc. they’re incredibly beautiful. There’s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=mardersteig+site:typophile.com&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">quite a bit of information here on Typophile</a>, too.</p>
<p>He was a friend of Stanley Morison and produced extensive, scholarly research on Francesco Griffo da Bologna, Felice Feliciano, Aldo Manuzio, Leon Battista Alberti, calligraphers from the Renaissance and roman inscription in Italy and abroad, among other subjects.</p>
<p>In a word, he’s a legend.</p>
<p>Re-reading my earlier post now, maybe it might have sounded as if I was talking about Jenson’s type being mixed in the case, but I was still referring to the De Aetna type, which I think might share some of the traits of Jenson’s Eusebius type concerning the presence/use of alternates.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Mardersteig</em></p>
<p>Giovanni Mardersteig discussed variant sorts in the roman types of the <em>De Aetna</em> in the introductory note to his reprint of the <em>De Aetna</em> text published in 1969. This is his redrawing of them, taken from Nicolas Barker’s reproduction in his essay of 1974 on the Aldine types in Paris.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/De Aetna type - variant sorts - Barker after Mardersteig 500_3600.jpg)</p>
<p>The <em>De Aetna</em> is printed from newly cast type and it has been called a kind of type specimen. But it is an odd piece of setting. There are several examples of u used upside down for n, and the other way round too I think, so maybe the caster was still at work and had not produced enough sorts to be used for the page in hand. It seems an odd thing to say about a book and a type that have been so endlessly discussed, but someone should really look at both of them more carefully.</p>
<p>I am not sure I fully accept all Mardersteig’s variants as being derived from different punches rather than variations caused by the casting and handling of the type. He redrew them to emphasise the variations he undoubtedly believed that he saw. But an actual example, like the image below, is more ambiguous.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/Aldus - De Aetna - det 3 500_6405.jpg)</p>
<p>There is not much doubt, I suppose, about the variant m and n (not shown here), and c too, but are the examples of different-looking a and e and u all really from different punches and intended as alternative forms? Still, the example shows some alternative sorts that are not in Mardersteig’s examples: a swash form of e that seems to be intended for the end of a word (there was a swash m too). But what is the long-tailed a doing in the middle of a word? And what was the function of the two p’s? Was the ‘majuscule’ style an experimental new form that might have replaced the other? More investigation needed.</p>
<p>One needs to remember that the e with its horizontal crossbar was equally experimental. We accept it as the normal form because of the prestige of the French imitations of the <em>De Aetna</em> type of over thirty years later.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ligatured sorts in Griffo’s italic for Aldus. But are there variant forms of single letters? I remain to be convinced.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Having been to see the original in the SF Public Library today with a loupe and a camera I am growing much more convinced in the case of the Jenson and I am surprised by this - the Aldus. In the case of Aldus I think there is less intention involved in the use of varients except in the ra, although I am not utterly settled about this. In the case of the Jenson it is looking more &amp; more deliberate to me. The Aldine seems to have far more varients than the Jenson. In both cases it was the lightest inkings that seemed most useful. they look less good but as evidence they seem great. I will post the photos I took through a loupe soon. I am going to try to visit again on Sat if I can. But if not, maybe I can convince some SF type types to be surrogates! If I can go you are welcome to join me if you can make it.</p>

I can certainly give you a list of probable targets but you may want too see what you would be looking for feature-wise for even more context. I might practice in the meantime. I got much better at it by the time I left the library. Managing a camera and a loupe at once is slightly tricky. Also, it&rsquo;s way to easy to let the flash come on - and they may toss you out with a flash going off or just warn you. It depends.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What if printing was so immensely profitable that they didn&rsquo;t need to re-use type?
At the very least, if they were reusing type, they had the time to sort through the huge character-sets they used.
In that case, perhaps they &ldquo;locked up&rdquo; frequently-used two-letter combinations (strung together via the holes in the type body, or soldered) and put these back in the case.</p>
<p>At any rate, the metal was relatively soft and malleable, so it would have been possible to fit the letter r to following letters in an on-demand, ad hoc basis. That r-a combination seems to have been a motif in Jenson&rsquo;s design process, a focus of how left median-height serifs fitted. Was Jenson compositor and printer? When did specialization evolve?</p>
<p>Comparing the economics and job functions of the changeover from phototype to digital should produce insights into the incunabula.</p>
<p>If they were attuned to the necessity of ligatures, but in a process of reducing the number of ligatures from the vast number mandated by following the scribal model, then they would perhaps have felt that treating certain non-ligating letter combinations with the same care and attention that they applied to truly ligated forms, was not an onerous burden, but a necessity.</p>
<p>The lengths compositors will sometimes go to with metal type was brought home to me by <em>The Book of Oz,</em>(mid 20th century) which was set in 14 pt Cooper Oldstyle (a similar size to Jenson&rsquo;s text), shaved and fitted letter by letter, to produce an effect that we would liken to negative tracking.</p>

<p>If my understanding is correct, early printing was done on such tight budgets that old type had to be melted down to reduce to cost of type-metal for new fonts. But Venice was among the wealthiest places in Europe, and the printers were setting up shop with subsides from the uber-wealthy, so they may have had a lot of options.</p>

<p>I always wondered how common these practices were. My design history professor has been working in design for fifty-plus years, and talked about it a lot. It seems like something that would have been especially likely in Monotype shops.</p>

<p>Recycling was a well-established practice in the technologies involved in printing, so was not a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p><em>But Venice was among the wealthiest places in Europe, and the printers were setting up shop with subsides from the uber-wealthy, so they may have had a lot of options.</em></p>
<p>Subsidies? Unlikely to be the driving force in a new media boom.</p>
<p>Again, compare the incunabula with recent events. DTP was a revolution because it drastically reduced the cost of publishing. The same was true of printing. So forget about tight budgets and subsidies&ndash;there was a shit-load of money to be made in printing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just left the Library of Congress. Unfortunately I was not allowed to take a camera into the rare books reading room! That makes this much harder, when I have some time after graduation I’ll get the library to do some macro shots.</p>
<p>The books I looked at were the <em>Biblia Latina</em>, <em>Naturalis Historia</em>, and <em>De Evangelica Praeparatione</em>. The bible turned out to be set in blackletter, and is very butch with studded leather covers and straps, but not especially applicable as the heavy impression and chunky letters make spotting alternates a nightmare. But there did appear to be at least two versions of <strong>a</strong>, distinguished by their upper counters, one appearing narrower and more geometric, the other slightly wider and rounded. The narrower version often appears at the beginnings of, and after t and r. Again, the type design, heavy imprint and thick paper make it hard to discern if these differences are intentional.</p>
<p>In the other two books I focused on the letter <strong>a</strong> after <strong>t</strong>, <strong>r</strong>, and <strong>g</strong>. I noticed the same patterns as Eben—<strong>a</strong> is often a narrower sort after t and r, as well as at the beginning of words. There is a very narrow, effete <strong>a</strong> that sometimes appears after <strong>g</strong>, the difference is so strong it is obvious without magnification. What stood out to me was that the use of the alternates appeared inconsistent—it does not occur everywhere, but not random. I don’t know latin, so I cannot tell if this is somehow related to the grammar.</p>
<p>And now for a tangent: the next time you feel bad about shipping a book with a nasty error, remember that Nicholas Jenson shipped at least one without checking to be sure that the rubricators filled in all of the drop caps!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I’m watching the BBC Gutenberg documentary (fabulous!) and about 31 minutes in Fry states that the old printers had alternate characters of different widths to keep lines of type justified. If he is correct, could that be part of what’s going on here? It would certainly explain the inconsistent use of the variants. If Fry has a source to back that notion up it would make a lot of sense, as Jenson is believed to have learned printing in Mainz.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Gutenburg did have a ton of extra sorts. This is well researched &amp; checked on. Partly this was for the reason Fry gives but partly it was because in order to look like a book and to make a text that people would recognize as a legitimate text you simply had to have them. Think about how fancy pants typophiles feel about f ligatures and bump it up 12+ notches or so!</p>
<p>The thing is, when you read about the Bremer Presse the reason for their sorts ( as given) is the same - to make a more even page. But if you actually look at how they are used it doesn&rsquo;t 100% totally wash. What is true though is that if you have a tight line of text where you wish you had more space it is easy to swap those narrow r shapes &amp; narrow s shapes in - and they do work reasonably well.</p>
<p>What is certain is that the letter culture of the day in which Jenson made his letters was one where having more than one r would be seen as traditional/natural/obvious etc. The other thing is that what Jenson as was doing was high craft - like - well it&rsquo;s hard to say now because we don&rsquo;t have places to go buy custom made stuff much anymore. But they definitely did. 99% of everything you could buy would have been. Standardization would have been the novel notion - not custom design. Standardizing on 5 or 6 r shapes might have seemed like a big leap!</p>
<p>I think Alan May is a good source for Fry.  ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I got a new sample today from Vassar. They say it&rsquo;s 1470. And&hellip; It seems to lack the features I had seen elsewhere. There do seem to be two &ldquo;a&rdquo; shapes but their differences are subtle and their use does not seem to follow a pattern. One  &ldquo;a&rdquo; has a spring tail and the other is lightLook at the word &ldquo;natura&rdquo; on the 3rd line. I would have expected a variant &ldquo;a&rdquo; after the r there. I don&rsquo;t see one. It may be that at this size casting differences obliterate any possibility of detective work.</p>
<p>The font is is quite small I think. I have included some paper texture and some brushwork next to the sample to give you some idea. The sample didn&rsquo;t have a ruler but I think I can draw some inferences.</p>
<p>I am still looking at the r. In general the r used is the one with the flat (vertical) end. But there is the word &ldquo;inferre&rdquo; at the bottom of this sample. The second r seems like a variant to me.</p>
<p>The diamond shaped colon &ldquo;:&rdquo; is pretty cool isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>The long serif under the r&rsquo;s arm is great.</p>
<p>Sorry you have to scroll.</p>

<p>Even though it does look a little like there could be a pattern in the &ldquo;r&quot;s in this sample it&rsquo;s pretty weak I think.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Craig, I was also pretty surprised by that when I was looking at the Jenson books. When all’s said and done I’m still impressed by Jenson’s achievement and letters, but there’s some nasty stuff in there that leaves me wondering why people label his letters the most beautiful Romans ever printed.</div>

<p>If you look at the other accented characters, you will see the same for the ones that can be combined with the f and the ‘long’ s. This positioning simply prevents collisions with the terminals of the forenamed two letters.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Jenson_accents_5587.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You also will have noticed that in Jenson’s type the ‘long’ s shares the width with the f, which creates a gap to the next letter. The f and ‘long’ s in the type for the <em>Aetna</em>, which Griffo clearly based on Jenson’s model, show shorter terminals and a ı (dotless i) is used after these letters. I have seen a ı erroneously used upside down in the <em>Aetna</em>, but unfortunately at the moment I don’t recall where.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Griffo_kerning_3803.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The two following examples (of which one is taken from this topic) show that Jenson for instance also applied alternatively kerned T-capitals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Then why else do you think he made them so wide?
Surely he must have been aware that in a sequence such as ‘lydis ſcripſit’, the /ſ looks as if it is stranded between two words.
The gappiness following /ſ in many combinations goes against the ﬂow of his style, in which many glyphs are butted up against one another.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick: <em>Then why else do you think he made them so wide?</em></p>
<p>In Sweynheym and Pannartz’s type as used in <em>Opera</em> from 1469 the f and ſ have clear kerning and there doesn’t seem to have been a dot used for the i. The other accents seem to be placed in such a way that there isn’t any collision if preceded by f or ſ, but it looks quite tight.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Sweynheym_Pannartz_6151.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Da Spira’s type as used in <em>Historia Alexandri Magni</em> from 1473 shows the i and the ı, the latter for combining with the f or ſ. So why does Jenson’s type differ from these two types?</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Da_Spira_4494.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Stanley Morison writes in <em>Four centuries of ﬁne printing</em> (London, 1949) on page 19 after mentioning that Jenson’s type ‘did not materially differ from that of the Da Spiras’: ‘<em>Jenson&rsquo;s associate and successor, Herbort, issued a catalogue of books for sale (? 1482) which, […] contained a lengthy commendation of Jenson’s type wherein exaggeration was certainly not lacking. […]. The panegyrist is, however, well within the mark when he claims that “the characters are so methodically and carefully ﬁnished by that famous man that the letters are not smaller or larger or thicker than reason demands or than may afford pleasure”.<em>’</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Longs_interval_5067.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As you know, I strongly believe that the Jensonian model was a clever combination of optical preferences and a sophisticated systematized and standardized system for cutting, striking, and casting (see also my <a href="http://www.lettermodel.org">PhD-blog</a>). Griffo and Garamont reﬁned this model further, and for those who are conditioned with Garamont’s model, Jenson’s one looks perhaps a bit crude. But he paved the way for his successors.</p>
