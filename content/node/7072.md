  body: Though I don&#39;t know anything about the history of your interaction with
    them, assuming you paid them fairly for the logo, I think it&#39;s rude of them
    to behave that way. Kudos to you for actually wanting to carry the identity forward
    rather than pairing the logo with any old font you already have in your system.
    All clients should be so cognizant!
