  body: "See, this is what gets my goat. I have no idea who Jim Marcus is but this
    font is a, how do you say, direct rip of a calligraphic form that was used and
    perfected, by a calligrapher, for decades ... Alfred Linz. I have looked. to no
    avail, for the least little tribute to Herr Linz and have found none.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I posted on the other node the other night, about a lack of originality and theft,
    this is exactly what I was talking about. Where are the ethics? If T26 does not
    know about this then that is fine, but they need to know that this crap goes on
    right under their own roof.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "A large part of early T26 fonts were all produced as collages of existing
    forms.\r\nOn one side, it was a direction for research, on the other side, I was
    horrified by what T26 started to do, especially considered I was going to release
    with Emigre, which has always been painstakingly precise and thoroughly conscious
    in ethic matters.\r\n\r\nI have to say, however, that most of Jim Marcus typefaces
    were not so bad, they showed a quite original research in this \"collage\" aesthetic,
    despite the disputable methods of approach. Problem was they offered types with
    incomplete character sets, produced often with little or no care. Among the T26
    catalog, however there were true gems, like Frank Heine Amplifier and the original
    Tema Cantante by Eric Lin."

    picked through like it was garbage on the street! Collage... what a interesting
    term for theft of intellectual property! \r\n\r\nAbsolutely innappropriate behavior,
    no matter what you call it.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "I have not said the various aspects of those works are ethically fine.\r\nI
    just noted what was happening, on a general level, and the difference lies precisely
    there: who produced the most interesting work developed it to a degree which no
    longer relied on original elements of inspiration to be considered a theft or
    even a copy.\r\n\r\nEspecially if you say this one is from the work of a renowned
    calligrapher.\r\nFor his typeface \"Masoch-Dirach\", for example, Jim Marcus \"hacked\"
    the forms of that typographical masterpiece which is Peter Behrens' Behrens Antiqua,
    presumably from printed sources since no digital version existed.\r\nIt's largely
    questionable how this approach could make sense. As you say, as long as you do
    not differentiate enough from your source, and produce a simple alteration, it's
    really deprecable and that's why I hated so much T-26 when they came to the scene.\r\n\r\nI
    did not expect such a bad thing, and it trashed the whole efforts Rudy Vanderlans
    was putting into having those new experimentations recognized, when they were
    conducted on a path of absolute ethical integrity (P. Scott Makela \"Dead History\"
    was entirely re-digitized to make his type research a work on its own, as much
    as Brian Schorn \"AddMorph\" was never released because it depended on the digital
    data of Adobe Trajan).\r\nNow we pay the price\u2026"
