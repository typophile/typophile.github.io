  body: "Here's a small script I wrote for renaming glyphs. It assumes Robofab is
    installed. You type in two list of glyph names--the current ones and the ones
    you'd like to replace them with. With your particular task, you'd probably have
    to run it three times--once to change your standard names to a temporary name
    (e.g., a.temp), once to change your alt glyphs to standard names, and once to
    change the temporarily named glyphs to the alt names. (Describing this sequence,
    it's apparent that it wouldn't be too hard to write a script that does it all
    in one run, but I have other things I'm supposed to be working on. Even so, it
    should still be faster than doing it manually.)\r\n\r\nAs for the class kerning,
    I'll assume you've created the kerning classes in FontLab's class panel. You could
    export your classes as a text file, do a round of search and replaces in a text
    editor (similar to the steps I described with the script), and then import the
    classes, replacing the existing ones. Note: the kerning will stay with the original
    glyphs, even when you rename them. Once you've done all this, rebuild the kern
    feature. There's probably an easier way to do this, but I've done it this way
    and it works.\r\n\r\nHere's the script:\r\n\r\n<pre>from robofab.world import
    CurrentFont, CurrentGlyph\r\n\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\n\r\ntString = \"a b c\"
    # put your 'before' glyph list here\r\nlistOne = tString.split(\" \")\r\n\r\ntString
    = \"a.1 b.1 c.1\" # put your 'after' glyph list here\r\nlistTwo = tString.split(\"
    \")\r\n\r\ni = 0\r\nwhile i < len(listOne):\r\n\tg = f[listOne[i]]\r\n\tg.name
    = listTwo[i]\r\n\tg.update()\r\n\tg.autoUnicodes()\r\n\tg.update()\r\n\ti = i+1\r\n\t\t\r\nfl.UpdateFont()\r\n\r\nprint
    \"All done.\"</pre>"

    got the time to learn how to use it. This certainly gives good motivation to it.
    \r\n\r\nJust one thing: what should be defined to listThree? Should there be a
    line that counts the number of items in the two other lists and puts that into
    listThree? Or did I misunderstood something? Also, I tried to make a lists of
    19 glyphs, but FL macro window crops the end of the lines. That's no problem really,
    I can run the script in several passes. \r\n\r\nIt did cross my mind to TextWrangle
    the kerning (it's all in the OT kern feature), but it is still a lot of work.
    Can't python access that data in the same way it changes the names and unicodes?"

  body: "listThree? I don't see that. In an earlier version I posted it may have been
    in there (that was the name I previously used instead of \"listTemp\"). \"listTemp\"
    is a copy of \"listOne\" with \".temp\" appended to the glyph names. It's necessary
    to assign these temporary names to the first set of glyphs before assigning the
    first list names to the glyphs in the second list. Once that's done, then it's
    safe to assign the names from the second list to the glyphs in the first list.
    You can't just sort of say a=A and A=a or you end up with both having the same
    names (wich won't work anyway).\r\n\r\nIt's up to you to make sure the two lists
    have the same number of items. (Presumably, you are swapping pairs of glyphs;
    one list has the first member of the pair, the other list has the other. So they
    should number the same.) Edit: I rewrote it to include code to check that the
    lists are the same length. It will tell you if they are not.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is
    possible to put way more than 19 glyphs in the lists. You can make the macro window
    wider, and you can scroll to the right. (I have run into a limit before, but it
    was way higher than 19.)\r\n\r\nIt's probably possible to access the OT features

    did also manage to build up longer lists. I'm not sure if the code swaps the unicodes

    running the script, the both switched glyphs have the same unicode value. If I
    understand your script correctly, it actually switches the names of the glyphs,
    and then based on that name, it adds a unicode value. Could these unnecessary
    unicodes result from the autoUnicode function? \r\n\r\nMaybe after I study Python
    a bit more, I can find out about accessing the OT features and class data. Considering

  body: Hmm. The "autoUnicodes" method should remove the unicode value if there isn't
    one that corresponds to the glyph name. You can fix it by selecting the affected
    glyphs in the Font window and using the Generate Unicode... command from the Glyph
    menu. If you try to generate a font without fixing it, FontLab may hang.

    yes, it is possible to access classes and features through python via <code>fl.font.classes</code>

  body: "I asked about it on the RoboFab group ( http://groups.google.com/group/robofab
    ) and Tal Leming responded:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Yes, with a caveat. The dialogs
    provided with robofab.interface.all.dialogs are misbehaving/not working in Mac
    OS 10.7. We're actively trying to resolve that but making a single API for all
    of the various OS, OS version and application combinations is frustrating. Other
    than that it works as far as we know. \r\n\r\nYou'll need to install RoboFab from
    source. To do this you need to figure out which Python FontLab is using. I'd tell
    you which it is, but it changes frequently and I'm not 100% sure where things
    stand at the moment. To figure out the Python version, run this in the macro panel:
    \r\n\r\n<code>import sys \r\nprint sys.version</code> \r\n\r\nOnce you have this
    report, you can figure out which Terminal command you need. If you see 2.5, your
    command will be python2.5. If you see 2.6 and you are running OS 10.6, your command
    will be python. If you see 2.6 and you are running OS 10.7, your command will
    probably be python2.6 (I'm not running OS 10.7, so I'm guessing here). If you
    see 2.7, you are almost certainly running OS 10.7 (otherwise you really messed
    up your system) and your command will be python. \r\n\r\nNow follow these steps,
    replacing yourpythoncommand with your Python command as defined above. \r\n\r\n1.
    If you don't have it already, get the \"RoboFab + FontTools + DialogKit Combo\"
    zip here: http://robofab.com/download/index.html \r\n2. Unpack the zip and put
    it in a location where you want the files to live. For example <code>/Applications/RoboFab</code>.
    \r\n3. Open Terminal. \r\n4. Type \"<code>cd </code>\" (the space is required)
    and drag the FontTools folder to the Terminal window. This should give you something
    like \"<code>cd /Applications/RoboFab/FontTools</code>\". Hit return. \r\n5. Type
    \"<code>sudo yourpythoncommand setup.py install</code>\". Hit return. \r\n6. A
    bunch of installation notes should appear. \r\n7. Type \"<code>sudo yourpythoncommand
    </code>\" (the space is required) and drag the install.py file in the RoboFab
    directory to the Terminal window. Hit return. \r\n8. \"<code>Robofab is now installed.</code>\"
    should appear along with some other text. \r\n9. Type \"<code>sudo yourpythoncommand
    </code>\" (the space is required) and drag the install.py file in the DialogKit
    directory to the Terminal window. Hit return. \r\n10. \"<code>dialogKit is now
    installed.</code>\" should appear along with some other text. \r\n11. Restart
    FontLab if you have it open. \r\n\r\nHopefully this will work. We'll likely try
    to make this easier when the dust settles.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis worked for
    me using MacOS 10.6 and FL 5.1. Scripts run noticeably faster, too."
