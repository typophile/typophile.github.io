  body: Could the word or phrase simply stop abruptly before being completed, say
    drop the last letter or two, and yet still be understood? I'm thinking of the
    old "Plan Ahead" posters where it appeared that the designer ran out of room and
    had to squeeze the "d" on at the end or drop it off altogether.

  body: "Is this for some sort of visual gag or charge?\r\n\r\nIf it's a words + icon
    logo, instead of the icon there could be a dotted placeholder where it reads 'place
    logo here', simulating some unworked template. Or maybe a web-like placeholder
    with a red 'X'. It could also be set with times/times new roman and helvetica/arial.\r\n\r\nThese
    wouldn't work well for a real assignment, though"

      take another logo with the word Mart in it, and crudely replace the first word

    your letters/letter. You are very lazy to do that you are too lazy to even pickup
    a brush..But somehow you manage to dip the brush in colour and place it on the
    paper. the colour slides down on the paper but you have still not lift or moved
    the brush.....and....suddenly you fall asleep.....then imagine the stroke that
    you would get on the paper. You can use the composition of that letter and stroke.

    _\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\n\"Because he felt Americans did not recognize irony when
    they read it, he proposed the creation of a special typeface to be called ironics,
    with the text slanting in the opposite direction from italic types, to indicate
    the author\u2019s humour.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm unclear on what backslant actually
    conveys, partly because it's so rarely used. Hey, maybe we should ask readers
    of Arabic (and Hebrew) since they're confronted with slant in the \"wrong\" direction
    quite regularly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I see digitaal dialoog, too. Could be the image name you chose was not unique.
    Their still working on that (dealing with duplicate names of uploaded images).
    (The one above is called "logo.jpg". What are the chances you used the same name?
