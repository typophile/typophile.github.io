body: If I choose one typeface for a logo should the typeface used for all the print
  materials like brochures for eg.(bodytext and headlines)be from a different typeface
  family or it doesn't matter? If it matters, why is that so?

  body: It is all about context. If the typeface you've chose for the logotype is
    very strong then using something different is a good way to balance and not overpower.
    If the typeface is subtle it is ok to use the same typeface. Or, you can really
    mix it up and do the opposite. It all depends upon the message you are trying
    to convey.

  body: "If your logo and its typeface are distinctive, there are compelling reasons
    NOT to use the face any place else. To do so merely dilutes the distinctiveness.
    \r\n\r\nAs Miss Tiffany suggests: it's all a matter of context, ifs, and depends.

  body: "LOGOTYPE should be more towards legibility and headline/bodytext type should
    be more towards readability.\r\n\r\nSo, I think you should use different type
    for headlines and body text, otherwise the logo will become like one big headline
    only.\r\n\r\nBut the style and family of type shouldn't change too dramatically.
    For instance, if logotype belongs to some Roman Serif font, then you can use a
    simplified serif one for your Headlines and so on....\r\n\r\n\r\nNITIN GARG |

  body: "OK, but how about if I use Vista Sans alt bold for a logo\r\nand then take
    Vista sans regular (not alt) for headlines...and some matching serif type for
    bodytext? Would that be a crime?"

    Regular, but they still go in harmony. \r\n\r\nI find this as a good solution.
