  designing a logo. I found a font that I like for free from a website and want to
  use just one letter \"s\" for my logo. I will not be selling the logo or distributing
  the font in any way, just want to have a clean logo for my website/potentially more
  than that in the future.\r\n\r\n1) can I do this?\r\n2) can I customize the logo
  in photoshop or something and tweak it to make it original and use that? \r\n3)if
  not, what steps do I need to take in order to do this legitimately?\r\n\r\nAny help
  or advice would be extremely appreciated guys!"

    the designer). The thing is, when you use a font for something that represents
    you (as opposed to a client) that might count as \"personal use\" (as opposed
    to \"commercial use\"). But it depends how the designer sees the situation, and
    it's always good to get an OK in writing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
