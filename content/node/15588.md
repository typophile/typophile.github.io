body: "Does anyone know the name of this font? I tried the fonts.com identifier with
  no luck, and a google search of typophile.com. (I can't get the in-site search to
  work.)\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know a name for this general type of font, or know
  of similar fonts? (E.g. ones that have something of the class of a serif while not
  having traditional serifs and having a more or less fixed stroke width) I seem to
  remember a lot of British street signs as being in a similar (if not the same) font.
  Also the <a href=\"http://www.barclays.com\">Barclays</a> logo seems to be in the
  same ballpark.\r\n\r\nMany thanks..."
