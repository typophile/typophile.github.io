  body: "there is a little  font in  China, so  I can make up for this vacancy. This
    font can play a decorative role. the industry of font in our country is the state
    monopoly , and the process of design was difficult. Our boss is the  sales manager
    of Shanghai Founder font sales, this year's total turnover is about 25000 U.S.
    dollars.   because of  the inadequate budget, i did by myself independently,this
    is the personal hobby why I insisted to today.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    does that work? The state makes all the fonts in a few companies, and then these
    are distributed free to all users?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "The  Founder had monopolied the market of press , books and periodicals ,
    nearly 98%. Most of the advertising company also did not pay the font royalty
    , only the large-scale company did. The price of purchasing font by Founder is
    not enough 30 cents each word. so seldom designers are willing to develop font
    for Founder.\r\n"
