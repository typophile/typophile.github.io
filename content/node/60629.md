  body: 'The name looks wrong to me. The type is fanciful and very, very non-revolutionary.
    English meaning could also be a problem: look up "revolt", "revolution" and "revulsion"
    in a dictionary. That said, I quite like the letter shapes.'

  body: beautiful shapes! I'm not sure what the first comments were about but, I don't
    see much not to like here. in my case, I'm just not sure when I'd get to use such
    a delicate design.
