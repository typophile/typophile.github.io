body: I need a font like the one I have drawn in the attachment.  It is think, symetric,
  and has rounded angles.  Notice the &#39;w&#39; is round on the bottoms instead
  of having sharp angles.   I also gave two examples of how the &#39;b&#39; should
  look.  Note; these are hand drawings, I am not looking for a font that emulates
  handwriting.  Please help and thanks for your time.  <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69012.jpg"
