    typeface it is.\r\n\r\nI saw it on http://www.moodboard.com/ and find it to be
    very friendly and inviting."

    but no cigar. I think this font should show up in a Script category.\r\n\r\n-

    it turned out to come from a Japanese site, it wouldn't surprise me. I have seen
    similar brushed looking fonts when browsing those sites."

  body: I failed to find the exact font, too. My candidates for a similar "feel" would
    be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/maiandra/" target="_blank">Maiandra
    Demi Bold</a> and Ryoichi Tsunekawa's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/talking-five/"

    but no luck thus far. Hopefully the mystery will yet be solved.

  body: "That's a new one for the Script Guide (Part 6). Thanks Angel. \r\n\r\nDid
    you just happen to recognize that one, or do you have a way of finding these?
    I have seen you pull some obscure ID's out of the air, and I'd like to know how
    you do it, if you would tell us. Do you have photographic memory of fonts (like
    Yves)? Seriously, I am curious about your IDing methods, if you care to share
    them. I can tell you that I primarily use either books and catalogs (guided by
    some memory of where I think I saw something before), or my Font ID Guides, or
    if all else fails, scanning through categories on font web sites.\r\n\r\n- Mike
