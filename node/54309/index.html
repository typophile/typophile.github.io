  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The San Francisco Chronicle rolled out a redesign yesterday. I don't know any of the details about who did what, or what they are now using (Archer for section heads and subs). The old design was one I often lauded in these forums, especially the sturdy elegance of Parkinson's Electra adaptations. From a type perspective, I'd have liked to see them update their headline sans and call it good. Now it feels like they did a trendy typographic mashup with no cohesive style. Nothing wrong with the individual types they used mind you; I'm sure this largely just my reaction to change. It will be interesting to see the broader reaction and how it evolves. In the mean time... Michael Phelps smoked pot *wow*

Looks like Farnham for both headlines and text, Antenna for sans, and Archer for section heads, et al. Some interesting choices -- as you say, Randy, a bit of a mash-up. 

Seems a bit less serious and more lifestyle oriented than hard-hitting news.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the use of Archer in the section heads, but I feel like it clashes with Farnham where they've stuck the two together.

I also think they've misused Farnham for the big bold headlines. On the main head of Sunday's front page, the combination of somewhat loose leading and jamming it up against the photos to the left looks really clunky to me.

I'd like to see them use a lighter weight of the Farnham for the headlines (and possibly a slightly larger type size to compensate) and let the idiosyncrasies of the face shine through. Also, the mix with Archer for the kickers might work better if the two faces were more similarly weighted. The bold Farnham works better in smaller headlines -- the leading looks like it's the same as in the larger headlines -- perhaps it just works better smaller.</div>

Ugh, did they actually <strong>want</strong> me to read this? It's not a serious redesign at all, and reader response has been mostly disgust (as far as I can tell from the SF Gate comments). For a paper that mostly prints wire stories and drastically reduced their number of writers, the redesign is a classic example of fixing the one thing that wasn't broken.

Oh, and the newsstand price is now 75¢ a copy. Draw your own conclusions.

Even still, the flag is old school blackletter and I'd argue it still wouldn't work.</div>

The Chronicle is using both Farnham Display (heads) and Text (text).

Regarding the heads: I can't help but think that the overall look might have been stronger and a tad more serious if they had commissioned a custom, slightly narrower version of Farnham specifically for headlines.

But, I'm not looking at the paper in hand, and it's a bit unfair to judge a newspaper from a PDF.
