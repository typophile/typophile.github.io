body: "The samples in the image *are* Officina. I have a specific idea in my head
  of what the lowercase \"y\" looked like. \r\n\r\nIs there something else very similar
  that has a descender on the y that stops at roughly the angle and length of the
  mark on the lower sample? I dunno, maybe a different version or iteration of Officina?
  The y I'm thinking of is the same in every other respect and the rest of the face
  mostly looks like I'm imagining it should.\r\n\r\nThanks gang.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maybe_officina_5545.gif]"

  body: is this for a logo? If so, you could certainly just modify the y yourself.

title: Am I going crazy? I thought I wanted Officina Sans, but the "y" is all wrong.
