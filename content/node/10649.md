  body: 'Years ago, I worked for a large regional nonprofit theater, and we were about
    to premiere a new play by David Henry Hwang. A board member, who was very concerned
    that the company promote the show in a way that was completely respectful to the
    Asian-American community &#40;she was Chinese-American herself&#41;, helped me
    procure a piece of art that we used for the poster. <BR> <BR>But the board member
    wasn&#39;t done yet, since I still had the show logo to design. She took me aside,
    made sure I was intently listening to her, and then she spoke these immortal words:  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;NO CHOP SUEY LETTERING!&#34; <BR> <BR>She didn&#39;t mention anything
    about Skia, however. But just to be on the safe side, I wouldn&#39;t use that
    either. <BR> <BR>More seriously: obviously, her intent was to make sure that I,
    as a white person, wouldn&#39;t inadvertently do something that was disrespectful.
    You, as an Asian or Asian-American, may feel differently than she did about such
    typefaces. For the record, however, I <i>never</i> even considered using one of
    them. They should only be used in kitschy contexts, and even so, probably not.

  body: Immerse yourself in your vision of Jade Design. Even if it&#39;s a fake company,
    create a little creative brief for yourself about the company and determine what
    you&#39;d want the brand to say.  <BR>  <BR>Remember that you&#39;re not just
    creating a look for somebody, you&#39;re creating a brand that stands for what
    the company is about. Also, ask yourself if the fonts you&#39;ve selected and
    the look you&#39;ve created really addresses all these things you&#39;re tying
    to accomplish.  <BR>  <BR>Think about it this way, if you opened up the phone
    book and saw the Jade Design logo, would you hire them to design anything for
    you?  <BR>  <BR>If your answer is no, than you haven&#39;t fulfilled the purpose
    of a logo. In a consumer forum, a logo is to extend the brand visually and connect
    with the audience who would be inclined to use the product or service you&#39;re
    pitching to them.  <BR>  <BR>Good Luck and please post updated versions of the

  body: 'OK, now I feel bad for being so flippant earlier. I agree with Stuart and
    HD&#39;s comments. <BR> <BR>So, to be a bit more constructive with my own opinions:
    as I noted elsewhere in this forum today, I think the best logos are entirely
    unique to the companies or individuals they represent. The difficulty you have
    with a company called &#34;Jade Design&#34; is that you have a few readily available
    directions you can go in, but many, many other people have gone those directions
    before, to the point where they have become cliches. <BR> <BR>You have a couple
    of options: <BR> <BR>1. Avoid the cliches altogether. Maybe your client &#40;or
    you, if you&#39;re the client&#41; picked the word Jade for an unusual reason.
    Dig into that inspiration for a compelling image. <BR> <BR>2. Explode one or more
    of the cliches, meaning that you knowingly subvert the cliche. I think Abercrombie
    thought they were doing that, but instead they played right into it. Here&#39;s
    more successful idea that breaks a different cliche: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7219.gif"
    alt="canada bread"> <BR> <BR>Here the Canadian maple leaf, a way-overdone image,
    is merely referenced in the happy coincidence that the company&#39;s initials
    could be used to sketch it. It also takes on a sort of wheat imagery as well.
    I&#39;m not crazy about other aspects of this logo, but I think the approach was
    creative.'

    many clients opt for the most tame, most superficial solution while you as the
    pro would have preferred the more radical or more pure or more stylized or more
    neosimplicistic version or whatever, the thing closer to your heart. When I go
    to a pitch that DEMANDS three designs, I mostly have my heart set on one of those
    three... mostly the quite different, daring, difficult approach. Many clients
    prefer the simple tun-of-the-mill &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;, however. So whenever
    I can I opt to NOT give them a choice. After all, our job is to come up with a
    solution. Giving the client a choice is just shifting the difficulty of decisionmaking
    to him. I like to get loads of feedbacjk from the client, my briefing talks and
    eMails are long and go rather deep. When doing CD I speak to dozens of people
    from various positions in a company. And in the end I don&#39;t wanna see the

  body: 'I&#39;d like to talk about 3 things in this discussion: <BR>1. Cliches: I
    read once about a designer who said that in working on a logo, he first sat down
    and did all the cliche ideas to get them out of the way. THEN he started working
    on his client&#39;s logo. I&#39;ve always found that advice helpful in my own
    work. It takes a look at where we&#39;ve been with certain ideas &#40;an historical
    perspective perhaps?&#41; and allows you to take a fresh look at them and at your
    client. <BR>2. How many options to present: I have presented a client with as
    many as eight different options in order to get them thinking strategically and
    answering questions like what is my business strategy? what is my marketing strategy?
    who am I? what do I do? how do I do it? It&#39;s surprising how often clients
    don&#39;t relate those answers to an identity design. <BR>3. Logos should work
    in b&amp;w first: This was a basic rule when I went to art college too. Now &#40;hopefully
    wiser ;-&#41; I think that it relates not so much to application &#40;variation
    in size and media&#41; as to perception - it is a valuable way to make sure to
    get the overall shapes right. These are perceived first by the viewer and we often
    lose sight of that while working on it. '

    for a crime book publisher is like an owl or a book for a book shop, or a pair
    of glasses for an optician, it&#39;s just too flat, even if you stylize it...
    it&#39;s just a one-dimensional, all too simple idea. What we came up with is
    a completely remodelled flammable-sign I once photographed from a NY gas tank.
    We completely redesigned the flame, and on the stationery and business cards it
    was to be foil stamped, and we felt that the danger/hot association was still
    quite close to the topic at hand, worked very well as a stand-alone sign &#40;without
    the companies name&#41; and it was nice to use a more or less simple everyday
    iso-sign in a completely different context and make it work instead of working
