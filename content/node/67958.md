  book project that I'm entering into the ISTD student awards. I made a post a few
  months back regarding the format of references and I'm back now to ask your collective
  advice over their spacing. \r\n\r\nI've been using Book Typography - A Designer's
  Manual, as I always do for book projects, and have followed its guidance on the
  spacing of references. However, I'm not sure the hard and fast rules are working
  here. If you look at the attached screen-grab, You can see how the standard width
  of spacing I've used looks OK, in my opinion, for the reference at the end of the
  paragraph. But with the ones located in the midst of the text, especially after
  the quote in italics, they look inconsistently spaced.\r\n\r\nAre the rules I've
  been following acceptable or shall I set up my own spacing conventions depending
  on where the reference falls in the text? I want this to be stop on for the competition
  so don't want to be let down by inconsistent spacing.\r\n\r\nAny tips or pointers
  on this would be gratefully received.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJono\r\n\r\n"

    question to a tutor but he said it was OK. I'll pass that on to him!\r\n\r\nThey
    are the same weight as the body copy, and at the standard height that the superscript
    option button puts them at in InDesign. Is that a big no-no? Have I committed
    a sin? Or is it just a case of playing around with the setting in superscript
    options?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJono"

  body: "I agree with Nick on all his points. The weight seems light, because the
    characters are probably just reduced from the full size font, even though used
    at probably 70% the size. Professional type, like Nick creates, will have special
    superscript characters that are designed to be used at this small size, and thus
    will be closer to the weight of the full sized characters that the scripts appear
    with. (For fun, take a script character from such a font, and render it the same
    size as the normal numerals ... it will appear bolder, probably fatter, and otherwise
    odd. But in its proper space and size, it will look perfect.)\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Hello Don,\r\n\r\nThanks for elaborating on Nick's points. I'm using ITC
    New Baskerville, and it's too late to change now so close to the deadline. However,
    I've altered the character style for my references by changing the weight to bold,
    lining numerals and a baseline shift of up 2pt. Would you say they are better
    now? And is the spacing any better too? \r\n\r\nI tried to attach a new picture
    to this post but it kept giving me an error message so I've attached it to the
    original message above."

  body: "You\u2019ve gone a bit too far now&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;at least with the
    baseline shift, I think. The truth lies in between. I would lower the numerals
    so that maybe just one quarter of the glyph lies above the ascender height. If
    you\u2019re uncertain, have a look at some typeface coming with superscript characters.\r\n\r\nTo
    your second problem, using the bold weight is not a solution either. The numerals
    looked to light before, now they look to dark. In case there is no semi-bold weight
    that you could try, stick to the regular. The scaled numerals do look ugly, but
    they\u2019re perfectly common. You\u2019re going to see more of them than \u2018real\u2019
    superscript figures when reading publications containing a lot of footnotes. The
    regular weight has the advantage over the bold one to avoid an increase in relative
    stroke thickness, which is usually understood as a sign of emphasis&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;not
    what you\u2019re aiming at, I guess.\r\n\r\nA third point: Think about tightening
    up (or even removing) the space between a full stop or comma and following superscript
    characters. You could align the right edge of the punctuation mark with the left
    edge of the numeral or even go a bit further. This is something you can\u2019t
    automatise; you have to look at each footnote separately."

  body: "ITC New Baskerville unfortunately does not include true superscript numbers
    (other than 1, 2 and 3). Thus you will probably have to live with reduced size
    characters for scripts. The baseline shift default is probably okay, it was the
    fact that you were using old style figures, with their descenders, that caused
    the problem. Lining are probably okay at the default.\r\n\r\nSo you have fixed
    two of the three problems Nick pointed out. The other one can only be handled
    by choosing a higher quality (in terms of glyph availability) font. Lesson learned,
    I hope."

    bold it's almost the second read on the page, no good.\r\n\r\nBut deadlines are
    a bitch, so it's understandable that you'll have to do this ASAP. I doubt anybody
    in a position to judge this thing will spend very much time on those reference
    numerals. As long as it doesn't grab their attention in a negative way. \r\n\r\nThe
    quality of your overall submission should speak for itself. If you can, maybe
    link the final piece on this post so we can all check it out. I can't speak for
    everybody, but I'm sure everyone hopes you do well. Good Luck! "

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for all your advice, especially R, very helpful
    indeed.\r\n\r\nI've altered the baseline shift, applied a 0.01 stroke to the character
    and increased the horizontal scaling by 5%. I used the 1, 2 and 3 of Baskerville's
    superscript glyphs as a guide and they look about 95% the same when overlapped,
    so considering the size they'll be seen at I'm happy. I've also removed the space
    in between the reference and the punctuation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Improved?
    (the image is attached to the first post again).\r\n\r\nAs for using professional
    fonts, the lesson is learned for the future, but being a student a professional
    font would probably have been out of my reach for this project anyway considering
    the cost of printing and binding I'll incur. \r\n\r\nThanks again"

  body: "You\u2019re welcome. To my mind, there is not much left to criticise with
    the superscript numbers. I personally would reduce the baseline shift even a bit
    more, but this is just a matter of taste. The numerals, as they are now, are not
    going to attract any negative attention.\r\n\r\nBy the way: It would have been
    easier, of course, to use a digital Baskerville coming with a full set of superscript
    figures (like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/monotype_baskerville_pro_virtual\">this
    one</a>, for instance) in the first place. Still, this project is likely not to
    have been the last one for which you have to make the best of a suboptimal typeface.
    Next time you can say: I\u2019ve been through that before and I made it work."
