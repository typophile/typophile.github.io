  but cant for the life of me find it again. It had bears on it, and lots of flash,
  there is a small bear made with flash that you feed crazy thing, with some crazy
  url including bear(s) in the address.\r\n\r\nIt was a really nice looking site,
  with some great type, much like this one with simular fonts used. I would be really
  keen to find it again if anyone has any idea of the site I might be thinking of
  could you please post the url.\r\n\r\nThanks alot."
