body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I am looking for an &#40;easy-to-find, preferably free&#41;
  legible serif font that has an intimate connection with the city of Berlin -- perhaps
  it was designed by someone who was born and influenced in Berlin, or maybe it was
  Schinkel&#39;s favourite font or something... I was hoping that the font &#34;Sabon&#34;
  by Jan Tschichold would be a good candidate -- is there a Sabon-clone anywhere available
  on the web? After all, Tschichold worked in Berlin &#40;or maybe I&#39;m wrong about
  this?&#41;  <BR> <BR>Maybe someone can help me with this! Basically, we are putting
  together a little book with stories about Berlin and we would like the font itself
  to tell some story about the city... <BR> <BR>Best, <BR> <BR>Alois

    not any serifs. Sounds like a question for the wise ones at  <BR><a href="http://www.fontshop.de/index.php3?fsdsess=b8739aba7a31b5f018e02090788ae470"

    <BR> <BR>Sabon is much more French than German. <BR> <BR>BTW, you might actually
    be better off paying for this thing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    Street would be ideal for headlines -- perhaps worth the investment &#40;is there
    a place where individual City Street fonts are available? So far I&#39;ve only
    found the package for $120...&#41;.  <BR> <BR>To Stephen and Hrant: Yes, it seems
    that serif fonts are not that easy to find... I was hoping the font would have
    an indirect connection &#40;typographer born/educated in Berlin&#41;, as to the
    historical period, I was hoping to find something from the 1920s or 1950s &#40;pre-war/post-war&#41;.
    I certainly would want to avoid playing with stereotypical notions of what&#39;s
    &#34;German&#34; or &#34;Prussian&#34; &#40;no fracturs, for example...&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Again, many thanks so far -- further suggestions are more than welcome, of

  body: The City Street Bold, looks too heavy to function in an indoor or outdoor
    wayfinding environment. 1:5 stroke width to height is just about the boldest weight
    you can use. &#40;It is the maximum allowed under current U.S. ADA Guidelines&#41;.
    Makes me wonder what Berlin Street was really designed to do. <BR> <BR>There seems
    to be a lot of Standard Alphabet Highway Gothic Series EModified influence in
    the design.
