  this font? Particulalrly the &#34;LIME&#34; one, but both would be nice. My business
  cards are on hold until I get this... Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67597.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>Edit: not sure this is right - the e looks like Perla but the i is wrong
    and so is the thickness. Dunno. <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t really see the sans serif well
    enough for an ID, could be Futura or something in that vein. <BR> <BR>hmmm...
    I thought this looked <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56173.html?1103661869"
    target="_blank">familiar</a>'

    target="_blank"> general consensus</a> is that - though this isn&#39;t really
    Perla - <BR>that typeface is the closest match we could find. I hope this is <BR>good
    enough for you.

  body: It&#39;s tempting to do a greatest hits page - this, Bjork, the Prada logo,
    football jerseys, the Lost in Translation font, etc.  <BR> <BR>I.e. check here
    before you post your request. <BR> <BR>We could add that most major brand logos
    are custom, magazine mastheads frequently so as well. <BR> <BR>But who has the
    time to compile it...

    Malone</a> has some beautiful scents and candles. British company. <BR> <BR>Gentlemen,
    sorry about the girlie digression from matters typographic... the font is copperplate
    gothic of course.
