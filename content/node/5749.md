  body: Maybe Adriano meant Serpentine Sans Italic? &#40;This was from Image Club&#39;s
    old Letterpress 6.0 CD&#41;. I added some stroke thickness and some slant. &#40;A
    little more thickness and a bit less slant would have been closer, I think.&#41;

    target="_blank"> Serpentine Sans</a>  <BR>but couldn&#39;t find it anywhere on
    MyFonts. Looks like you  <BR>nailed it Mike.
