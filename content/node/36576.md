  I followed their links to the rival (<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/itc_kabel_std/?utm_source=August2007News&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ITCKabel&utm_term=em&utm_campaign=August2007Second\">ITC</a>

  versions of Kabel. As I peered at the Monotype/Koch version, I noticed with some
  disappointment that although the light, heavy, and black weights retain the bent
  terminal of the lower-case \"A,\" the regular weight seems to have suffered the
  sad excision of the distinctive bend in favor of a colorless arc.\r\n\r\nAm I over-examining
  the differences? Is there a story behind the design decision to differentiate the
  regular weight from its heavier and lighter neighbors?"

  body: When you say "Regular" I assume you mean the <strong>Book</strong> weight
    of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/kabel_std_ot/?sample_text=a&sample_size=144">Kabel</a>?
    It does look like it has less sharp of a bend than the other weights. I can't
    say what was in Koch's mind, but I do think this is the closest digital representation
    of his original.

  body: I do like that Kabel Light sample in your newsletter. Not to mention Carl
    and Nick's entries, and Stainless. And serifs on Univers looks better than I'd
    imagine. (now back to your regular programming).

  body: The Monotype version of Kabel was released under the name of Sans Serif to
    avoid royalty payments to Klingspor the original foundry.

  body: I'm not sure if "Sans Serif" ever made it to the digital world, Robert, but
    this particular Kabel is actually the Linotype version. It's simply available
    from Monotype, which is essentially the same company now.

    lacks that element, which adorns the other weights so distinctively."

  body: You are right Stephen. Linotype purchased the assets of the Klingspor foundry
    along with D. Stemple AG. I have the original showing from Klingspor circa 1930.

    130 is from the [[Linotype Univers]] family, not the old [[Univers]]. You can
    tell by the three-digit numbering system, instead of the two-digit system \u2013\_<a

    Klingspor situation is a bit more complicated ;-)\r\n[[D. Stempel AG]] became
    a partial owner of the [[Klingspor]] foundry in 1917. In the mid-1950s, they assumed
    the foundry altogether. Klingspor closed, and they brought most of the typefaces
    into their own manufacturing & delivery program.\r\n\r\nStempel had been a [[Linotype]]
    partner since the early 1900s. They were the manufacturers and distributors of
    Linotype matrices in Germany, and they later collaborated on typeface design projects,
    like [[Helvetica]] (1961) and [[Neue Helvetica]] (1983), fjust to name two examples.
    Linotype fully aquired Stempel in 1985. Several current Linotype employees started
    their careers at Stempel, like Otmar Hoefer, for instance.\r\n\r\nMost of this
