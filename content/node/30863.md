  Protection schemes used in Windows Vista. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/%7Epgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html\">A
  Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection</a>\r\n\r\nThis isn't the first
  page to denounce the apparently merciless lockdown that Microsoft proposes. I personally
  think that it is a bunch of crap, and I'll be damned if I'll ever concede the point.
  \r\n\r\nDRM is bad for consumers. DRM is bad for content producers. DRM is only
  good for content sellers and their cronies."

    Hollywood doesn't want anything to do with Microsoft, and the record companies
    are discussing dumping DRM entirely. Both of the next-gen DVD formats are already
    cracked, so that DRM system will be rendered an irrelevant waste. What the Vista
    DRM is going to do is prove that, even with some of the most qualified experts
    in the field and a bottomless pit of development funds behind it, DRM is still
    just a snake oil scam designed to sucker foolish executives into providing a new
    revenue stream to the scamsters.\r\n\r\nOf course, I've used Windows for about
    two hours total in the last three months, and I'm considering ditching my remaining
    PC entirely, so hopefully it's a moot point for me."

    going to use the cracks are the people who already download illegal content. The
    only people who are going to get hurt are those end users with consciences, i.e.,
    those who actually purchased everything with cash money. (Not that anyone has
    been able to play ANY HD content via their newfangled DVD drives anyway...)\r\n\r\nAs
    to ditching a PC, that's all well and good, but the longer time goes on the closer
    the two main OSes and their hardware become. A Mac is now a glorified PC with
    a nicer form factor and a better OS, but the video cards, etc. relevant to the
    MS DRM scheme are practically identical. And a lot of these MS changes are going
    to be forced onto the hardware."

    forgetting about pain of the movie industry's big backers. They're paying a fee
    for every movie that goes out with some worthless DRM scheme, only to be cracked
    and dumped online or counterfeited relentlessly by organized crime syndicates.
    Eventually the people behind all those dollars are going to look at the books,
    realize how many billions of dollars were flushed down the big DRM toilet, and
    wince in pain. It's important that they feel that hurt, because its whats going
    to sour them on DRM and finally kill it for good."

  body: I love that idea. Unfortunately, the DRM being implemented is at the very
    core of an entire operating system that will be distributed to millions of unknowing
    lemers before they know what's coming. It's gonna die, but it will be a long,
    painful death.

    They <em>own</em> home computing. I'm suprised that they gave in as fully as they
    did, when they probably could've shrugged it all off and forced the hands of the
    content providers. Particularly now that Apple is pushing so much content through
    a far less restrive DRMed pipeline on their own OS and store.\r\n\r\nThe hardware
    DRM really angers me, as it's completely disconnected from reality."

    settings that I know nothing about.

    doesn't need to bow to these industries, Microsoft is part of that industry; it's
    a member of the HD-DVD group. Microsoft also stands to profit from DRM, for years
    Microsoft has been trying to lure Hollywood to adopt camera-to-projector Windows

    won't stop trying."
