    wouldn't go amiss. Anyway the building is in a great location, we're going to
    try to book some space in it for next year's Business of Type event. \r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "well I remember before I left a Microsoft building there were some cubical
    things for visitors set up like temp desks. And I think IBM fist started the temp
    office where you used a card to login to any desk. And in old 90s MS we use to
    be able to log in easily from home. So 10 years later it's a commute thing. \r\n\r\np.s.
    the Dalton Maag way is to work from home or I ride a motorcycle to work to get
    there in under 18-25 minutes through any kind of traffic that would take a car
    00:50-1:30 to do it or the London Underground of 40:00-1:00. So the London way
    is to bike, motorcycle or login from home with +MSN Messenger. No cube required. "
