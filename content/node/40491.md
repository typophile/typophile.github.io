  enough for us to spot the years trends and make predictions!\r\n\r\n1. \"Helvetica\"
  the film will get an Academy award;\r\n\r\n2. Meta Serif will become the most used
  new typeface of the year;\r\n\r\n3. Microsoft will debut a new multi-language typeface
  for screen/web use and bundle it with Office.\r\n\r\n4. A typography \"Hall of Fame\"
  will open in the Netherlands (the first inductee will be \"Mr. 'T' but TO will be
  rejected due to excessive celebrations);\r\n\r\n5. Apple will FINALLY release an
  opentype friendly OS;\r\n\r\n6. Adobe will release a new typeface designed by Miguel
  Sousa;\r\n\r\n7. The Consortium will finally figure out a way to get kerning to
  work on screen.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add or detract, \r\n\r\nChrisL"

    and win big, mainly because their yard signs are so elegant, and despite the fact
    that they said, "We'll come up with a platform later."

  body: "Hrant returns to Typophile and converts Miss Giggles to absolute monarchy.
    Miss G. is so eloquent in its defense that a small Pacific island, with one typophiler,
    recruits her as Queen. Shortly thereafter, she declares war against Canada, because
    it booted Typophile off the internet. Hrant tried to tell her that was Typographi.ca,
    and it's all OK now, but it's too late. Japan says the island, hitherto unknown,
    actually belongs to it, and that Miss G is not Queen. China responds that it belongs
    to them, and the whole thing spins out of control and threatens to create WW III.
    \r\n\r\nAlso a young intern snaps her underwear at a randy President. She blabs
    to her friends, and it gets in the press, and the whole thing spins out of control.
    His as a result the Vice President fails to be elected, and a dunce is elected
    instead--who goes to war with the wrong country. \r\n\r\nOops that already happened.

  body: Adobe will announce later in the year that it has developed a new web style
    sheet standard that will be fully supported by Internet Explorer, Firefox and
    Safari by the end of the decade. (Opera will not offer support for this standard.)
    Also as part of this announcement is news that this new style sheet standard will
    be integrated into all Adobe CS4 products to allow export of XML based PDFs by
    the end of the decade. Deciding not to call this project the Adobe Style Sheet
    due to the resulting acronym, it will be called Niagara.
