body: Does anyone know what the actual legal status of the old Cassady and Greene
  font library. The company went bust in 2003 and their fonts appear widely on even
  some of the most reputable free font archives. Being on a budget and wanting a Bodoni
  to play with, i did a search for "free didone fonts" or something and found a bunch
  of links to Bodoni FLF. Before I download it, I want to know if these are legal.
