body: I've been googling to find a way to shift a certain glyph downwards in FontLab
  commands in generating glyphs but couldn't find any. I'm trying to place the commands
  in alias.dat something like unixxxx L+^circumflex (which shifts circumflex upwards),
  is there any way I could shift the circumflex down in alias.dat? would really appreciate
  the help...

  body: "It is possible to shift glyphs upwards by the [caps-height \u2014 x-height]
    distance: <code>L+^circumflex</code> and it is possible to enforce that the second
    component stays on the baseline: <code>L+~circumflex</code>. It is not possible
    to shift the component below the baseline, though. To do that, you should employ
    anchors. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

  body: "If you are looking for a good way to place diacritics more precise, I believe
    the best way is to always make two or three versions of them. Two if you dont
    have small caps in your font, and three if you have.\r\n\r\nFor instance, circumflex,
    circumflex.small*, circumflex.cap\r\n\r\nBy doing so you can place them so they
    fit their respective base character better. The circumflex.cap goes to the capital
    letters etc.\r\n\r\nYou can then adjust your alias.dat file to match this, for
    instance:\r\n\r\nAcircumflex A+circumflex.cap\r\nacircumflex a+circumflex\r\nacircumflex.small
    a.small+circumflex.small*\r\n\r\nThis could also be .sc, .smcp or whatever glyph
    naming routine you have."

  body: "Are there any script I could use? \r\nlets say it would ask for a value for
    the bottom anchor then applies it to a glyph list and create new versions like
    circumflex.btm\r\nso I would then just have to modify the alias.dat :\r\nunixxxx
    L+circumflex.btm \r\n\r\nthanks for the help guys!\r\n"
