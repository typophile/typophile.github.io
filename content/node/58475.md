  superior figures, etc., they're all lining!\r\n\r\nWhat's with that? it's like two
  hundred years ago, when they only had roman figures in italic fonts! Surely in this
  day and age foundries could bother to get some consistency happening. \r\n\r\nJust
  saying."

  body: "Goran, that's what I initially thought of as well, but when you think about
    it, letters can also be used in these same situations (especially for marking
    footnotes or scientific equations).  We just have to define a baseline and we
    accept that a p versus an x and an l will just all have different eyes.\r\n\r\nSo
    maybe it's just tradition, though I know math books back in the day were known
    to be published in old-style numbers (and I think someone on here posted an example
    of it too)."

  body: "I consider oldstyle figures a solution to a problem. Like full capitals,
    lining figures ruin the color of the page by creating a blot of type that the
    eye is attracted to, causing the reader to jump back and forth between the blot
    and the words being read.\r\n\r\nWhile OS figs solve this problem, they do not
    contribute to the elimination of a blot of this type. \r\n\r\nNow, if you consider
    that OSF are only used because they are prettier, then it makes sense to use them
    in the fractions and superiors as well. "

    fractions seems odd at first, but they do seem to be a better choice for text

    fractions option\u2014I\u2019m not sure how one could make it work now without
    picking non-default fractions from the glyph palette."

    not attempt to create using proper Unicode here. Anything with a descender up
    top and an ascender below is a problem, like (3|4|5|7|9) over (6|8).\r\n\r\nNonnumeric
    characters can be used in fractions. g/6 would be tricky. Denominators using capitalized
    accented variables, like A bar or A hat (I\u2019m using the spoken forms here),
    would be a problem.\r\n\r\nFractions, like many other realms of typography, are
    superficially simple and too often are given simplistic miracle solutions that

    extend between ascender and descender, not just ascender to baseline; then the
    denominators need go below baseline. Oh, what typophillic mess you got us into,
    Nick!

  body: A friend just sent me a PDF of a chapter from his forthcoming book, which
    was set in Adobe Garamond with InDesign. I noticed that the numbers in the text
    and the footnote numbers were both set in oldstyle figures. My first thought was
    that the failure to set the footnote numbers in superscript figures was an oversight.
    Now I'm not so sure.

    used to commonly look like in metal type. The answer differs from (a) in an important
    respect: the fraction ranges from the ascender line to the descender line. This
    centers it on the x and is big enough to read.'

  body: "It seems to me that looking for ranging numerals within fractions misses
    the point of ranging numerals, which is to harmonise visually with lowercase letters.
    Within a fraction, it makes far more sense for the numerals to harmonise with
    each other, since the vertical and horizontal arrangement of elements in a fraction
    are already distinct from that of lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nI can see a benefit
    to harmonising the form and detail of numerals within fractions to harmonise with
    those of \u2018oldstyle\u2019 text numerals, e.g. omitting the serifs at the bottom
    of the 4 and making the 0 match the proportions and stroke model of the oldstyle
    numeral, but I think it a mistake to make the forms ranging: you want the numerator
    group and denominator group to be distinct and balanced, to form cohesive numbers."
