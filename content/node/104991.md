body: "When the new font Nirmala was announced with Windows 8, one expected it to
  be better than Kartika, its unaesthetic predecessor with unacceptable shapes. But
  Nirmala Malayalam adds insult to the injury inflicted upon earlier.\r\n\r\nSample
  these:\r\n1. One conjuct has a missing stem\r\n2. Has a confusing stroke ending
  style\r\n3. Invents a clumsy way to handle descender portions \r\n4. Substandard
  design quality, no optical corrections or proper stroke modulation\r\n\r\nPlease
  see the jpg attachment for details\r\n\r\nDid the type designer(s) consult some
  one who knew Malayalam? Or did they think whatever they design will be accepted
  by others?  I had pointed out the design problems in Kartika years back, but from
  repeating the same mistakes and making it worse it seems the people concerned donot
  care.\r\n\r\nI am not competent to comment on other Indian scripts in the font,
  but I hope they are not designed as mindlessly"
