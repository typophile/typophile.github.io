body: "Thanks to years of idle hoarding, I now find myself in possession of a dizzying
  and frankly unproductive number of fonts. 6,300 to be exact. 99% of which I'm sure
  are utter crap, (I can honestly say out of the entire library I've used maybe 30
  or 40 fonts; I don't even know what most of them <em>are</em>. There's just too
  many) but as I've only been making serious explorations into typography for the
  last year or so I have trouble picking out the subtle differences between some typefaces
  that would make clearing out the chaff much easier. \r\n\r\nThe sheer number of
  options I've got has turned choosing type for a project is a forbidding task, and
  as I'm in the process of defining and refining my identity as a designer I think
  now is as good a time as any to reign in my font library and bring it down to a
  manageable level. Before I approach this task, however, I had a few questions that
  would make the task easier, and I thought the knowledgeable folks here would be
  able to help:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li>What classification system do others recommend
  for a library? Currently mine are split into serif, sans-serif, display, monospaced,
  script, and comic (for fonts specifically designed for comic book use). Should I
  sort them by time period? By foundry? Or something else?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Is there
  a nice average size for a \"starting\" library-- that is, one that includes standard
  fonts that should be part of every designer's library and excludes the many fonts
  that will eventually be added as required by new projects. I realize the idea of
  standard is subjective, and I've been compiling a list of candidates based on other
  threads on the topic here, but I haven't seen any threads that address the idea
  of an overall library size.</li> \r\n\r\n<li>Given the size of my current library
  and my relative inexperience with the nuances of typefaces, would it be better to
  clear everything and start over with a blank slate, or should I take the time to
  be discriminating? </li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI thank you in advance for your help.
  I'm looking forward to starting the new year with my library no longer in a state
  of madness. "

  body: "1. I think using the traditional classifications for type is helpful (sans,
    serif, etc.) but more subjective descriptions can be used: fat, bubbly, weak,
    athletic, etc. Whatever descriptions would be most helpful to you. Make as many
    classifications/groups/tags as you need.\r\n\r\n2. If you have the Creative Suite,
    and are on a Mac, you can see see [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4_fonts.html|Adobe's
    list]] and [[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1642|Apple's list.]] Those aren't at
    all a requirement, just a common starting point for many designers. You can scour
    Typophile for topics on which typefaces are 'must-haves.' There is no right number.
    Don't have too few and don't have too many. :)\r\n\r\n3. I would pull out what
    I thought was rubbish. Either turn it off in your font manager or just save it
    somewhere outside your fonts folder, so you can dig in it in the future. After
    that, I would take the time to be discriminating. I haven't done it personally,
    but MyFonts.com has the tools to function as a personal type catalog where you
    could organize a library with a robust tagging system.\r\n\r\nAlso, not to sound
    too harsh, but I peeked at the PDF r\xE9sum\xE9 on your website and noticed that
    is used free fonts. Not all free fonts are bad, but know that many are of dubious
    quality (or complete rip-offs of established typefaces). Glutting your library
    full of mediocre (or downright awful) free fonts isn't helpful. Also, you should
    know where your fonts came from. Make sure you actually have a license to use
    the fonts you have. This isn't legal advice, but this [[http://www.typophile.com/node/44344|Typophile
    thread]] helps clarify things and touches on relevant topics."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions! Tagging by descriptions would be helpful, since
    I tend to search for fonts based on the moods they convey more than their technical
    classification. It would certainly cut down on me squinting at a dozen lines of
    serif fonts trying to pick out which one is more \"relaxed.\"\r\n\r\nCrappy free
    fonts is one of the main reasons I've been meaning to purge my library: the few
    quality ones I do have are pretty much what came packaged with CS3. Everything
    else is basically the result of downloading waaaaay too many font packs that ended
    up having nothing more than novelty fonts, most of which were ugly. The Adobe
    list you linked to as a starting point is helpful.\r\n\r\nMy resume is a few months
    out of date; I've actually forgotten what fonts I used. Once I nail down how I
    want to present myself to potential clients going forward all of the fonts used
    will change. I even considered making my own just for headings ( I thought it
    would be a nice touch, since my ultimate career interest lies in illustration)
    but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet.\r\n"
