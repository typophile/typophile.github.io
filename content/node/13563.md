    body: "Well... Let me try to explain this by numbers.\r\n\r\n<strong>1.</strong>\r\nOne
      of the main directives of this project is to <strong>ALWAYS keep it on an Open
      [Source] Basis</strong> so we don't depend on third party, commercial solutions.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.</strong>
      \r\nI really believe on the future of Open Source Software.\r\n\r\nBear with
      me for a moment - I work as a Design Tecnhician in a Fine-Arts Faculty in Portugal.
      As you might know, our public education system doesn't have that much money.
      The one's who do are <em>usefull</em> courses/faculties like engineering...
      So this situation leaves us with obsolete growing, underdeveloped, non-market
      responsive solutions. All this because people who are running the system are
      spending money in vaious stupid ways. <em>If you are familiar with Manuel Castells'opinions</em><strong>You
      might agree that one way to promote  a better future is through the use of Open
      Source solutions.</strong> In a very practical way, save some money to invest
      on more important things - enter Linux & Open Source Software, <strong>hence
      the use of Fontforge.</strong>\r\n\r\nTake the case of our neighbours, the spanish
      region of Estremadura. The public education system developed their own personalized,
      scaled to needs Linux Distro - Linex - that they implemented on the whole school
      system. It worked and the savings were huge!\r\n\r\nBrasil and some regions
      in Africa and India are also taking on similar initiatives...\r\n\r\nI know
      these are difficult to implement solutions, and calculating the costs aren't
      this simple. But this takes to me next point.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.</strong>\r\nImlementing
      this cost saving solutions means taking on a higher maitenance cost and further
      system administration - hey! I work on an University... aren't Universities
      supposed to promote knowlegde? How about using these systems, develop them,
      teach students howto, and then comming full circle when students start to use
      them in their professional lives and saving money to companies etc...\r\n\r\nNevertheless
      students should be also trained on the tools that the market needs - so teaching
      commercial tools and practices is also necessary. So the perfect solution would
      be to train students how to do it independently of the tools.\r\n\r\nSo as a
      member of a Faculty I feel it's my obligation to start using this systems, and
      start promoting them (along with commercial and established solutions). <strong>The
      LiveType Project is exactly this - I want to show people that is possible to
      use the free, open source solutions to learn how to do it with professional
      quality.</strong> And talking about learning...\r\n\r\n<strong>4.</strong>\r\n<strong>The
      fact that they learn how to \"do it\" on a Linux platform, or on a Mac platform
      or on a Win platform doesn't affect \"what\" they learn.</strong> This is really
      it. I don't consider myself a type designer... I'm just an amateur typographer
      and type designer whanabe, so I also want to learn how to type design better,
      who knows if I grow to be good at it? I also want to learn no matter the platform.
      <strong>I also want to learn and knowlege should be acquired in a Free, Open
      Source Collaborative way!</strong> Things work out better if we collaborate
      with each other.\r\n\r\n<strong>5.</strong>\r\nFinally... I'm open to suggestions...
      Don't feel like learning how to use Fontforge? (even though it runs on Mac,
      Win & Linux machines)\r\nThen use the binary files, modify them, play with them.\r\n\r\nUse
      different software, and maybe even openning different areas on the site to different
      tools/software? \r\nWho knows? Suggest something, <a href=\"http://livetype.sourceforge.net/getinvolved.htm\">Get
      involved!</a>\r\n\r\n(this is the first time I try to write down these ideas...
      so it might read a bit strange. I'll be more assertive next time! Oh... and
      thanks, writing this down is really helping me to organse my thoughts about
      this!)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "FontLab offers significant educational discounts, because obviously educational
    institutions are worth supporting.\r\n\r\nFontLab is also developed in Russia.
    FontLab, Ltd. is a small, international company. It is not a big greedy corporation.
    I have no problem supporting it with what little money I manage to earn as a student.\r\n\r\nWith
    FontLab, one can use [[RoboFab]] and [[Python]] scripts. While FontLab is not
    OpenSource, both of these are. And they are the cutting edge of font-making technology.
    I think that students would really get a service if they were exposed to those\u2026\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
