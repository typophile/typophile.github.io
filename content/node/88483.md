  similar to that in the attached image? I'm just curious as to the historical inspiration
  of this. It has some Spencerian influence, but it's still different. Also, do you
  think it's French, Italian? I'm doing a study on ornamentation and curious to find
  more ornament of this nature. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAS \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spencerianflourishing_4401.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you want more print examples, the Dover reprints of Clarence P. Hornung's
    collections of 19th Century type ornaments have pages of them, but no text. This
    excellent book on [[http://www.artisticprintingbook.com/|fancy type]] has some
    too but the text is more about the technical side of printing rather than the
    source of the styles.\r\n\r\nAs a calligraphic ornament, I'm sure somewhere on
    youtube there's at least one film of someone drawing these with a pen held in
    a very strange way, dragged with the hand palm-side up."
