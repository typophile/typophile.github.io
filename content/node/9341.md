  thread</a> going again, so I&#39;m posting new. This is for &#34;The Typographer&#39;s
  Dream&#34; at Encore Theater Company. If you&#39;ve been waiting for your chance
  for your profession/avocation to be honored on stage, this is it. &#40;You already
  had your shot on television with &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34; -- ask Jared &#39;n&#39;
  Joe about that one if you haven&#39;t seen it already.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, my
  revised date for going to the show is this Friday, February 26. I have no idea how
  tickets are selling, but it&#39;s a good idea to reserve as early as possible. <BR>
  <BR>Who&#39;s in?

  body: Oops. I guess that shows that I pay more attention to what typeface the calendar
    is set in than I do to which numbers go with which days. <BR> <BR>Yes, I meant
    Friday the 25th. Thanks, Miss Tiff!

  body: The show has been getting some good press. It looks like they may be sold
    out for Friday. But they have extended the run through April 3 - plenty of opportunities
    remain for a mass outing if planned in advance.

  body: Hmmm...well, I&#39;m fairly available in March, with the exceptions &#40;as
    of this writing&#41; being Thu 3/3, Sat 3/12, and Thu 3/17 &#40;I double-checked
    those on the calendar, Tiff&#41;. Right now everything else is fine, I&#39;m pretty
    sure. <BR> <BR>Thanks for checking it out, Tamye!

  body: I recommend this production to type nerds and map geeks alike. I saw it a
    couple weeks ago and the writing is excellent, the characters are vivid, and the
    topic strays far from type, which is a reason to bring your long-suffering friends
    and family along. You won&#39;t be bored. You will probably laff. Looks like it&#39;s
    extended to April 3.

  body: Hey - I&#39;m a lurker here on typophile, but I&#39;m also the Company Manager
    for Encore Theatre, and as thanks for the self-promotion of the show that&#39;s
    going on here, I&#39;d like to offer typophiles the chance to see The Typographer&#39;s
    Dream at a discount group rate &#40;10 people or more&#41;.  It doesn&#39;t have
    to be all at one performance &#40;i.e., 5 at a Saturday, 2 at a Sunday Matinee,
    3 at a Sunday evening&#41;, but tickets would have to be paid in advance.  So
    if enough of you would like to see it, email me at <a href="mailto:reynaldi@encoretheatrecompany.org">reynaldi@encoretheatrecompany.org</a>,
    and let&#39;s make a deal! <BR> <BR>-Reynaldi

    so? <BR>Because I&#39;m gonna be in SF May 1-3 and I&#39;ll love to catch it.
