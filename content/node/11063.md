  <BR> <BR>This is a typeface that I have developed as a basis for a random process
  of events to be applied to to create the entire family. The original basis for the
  typeface was to create something that had both stamina to withstand the process
  as well as refined details that would be eliminated by the process. I wanted to
  create a very straight lined classical font to apply a very conceptual idea towards.'

  body: Nice.  The P reminds me of palatino gone bad.  I also like the E. It&#39;s
    very usable.  My only suggestions would to be to have a set x-height, as it appears
    &#40;and I could be wrong&#41; that the x-height jumps around &#40;note the b,
    e, k, x and y for example.&#41; <BR>Are you going to make a set of lowercase to
    go along with it?

  body: I would suggest to increase contrast on G, O and Q so they match the thickness
    of the C.

  body: 'Hi Vicki. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mean this to sound rude. The letters really
    do look like they were developed by a <i>random process of events</i>. That may
    be just what you&#39;re looking for. If so, great! Please disregard my next comments,
    as my eyes are used to looking at type not designed by a random process, but many
    many years of convention: <BR> <BR>The main problem I see is that your stroke
    weights are inconsisent. This font looks to me like it should have two weights,
    a thick vertical weight, and a thin horizontal one. Compare the horzontal top
    of your F with the top of the O. The F is way thicker right? They should be &#34;the
    same&#34; &#40;roughly&#41; Same for the weight in the other direction. <BR> <BR>As
    a guide to help you, look at a Bodoni. Bodoni Bold if you have it. Your not looking
    for proportions &#40;for proportions look at Trajan&#41;. Look at the thick and
    thins. It will be much more exagerated than in your font, but try to apply the
    same principles to your design. In general you will notice the thicks go from
    upper left to lower right, and never cross each other. The exception is the Z
    &#40;upper right to lower left&#41;. <BR> <BR>As a result of the weighting issue,
    the color of your letters are inconsistent. Meaning, if you squint your eyes and
    kinda go out of focus you&#39;ll see some are darker than others. You&#39;ll notice
    right away the G, O, Q, and C are light. Also the U, S, K, W and A are slightly
    light. <BR> <BR>This won&#39;t solve all the issues but it will certainly get
    you on your way. Again, disregard if you know all this and are just experimenting,
    in which case, I will shut up now. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy'

    on this type.  <BR>Good luck on your random processes. I&#39;m looking forward
    to seeing the aftermath of my walking on it, your coffee stains, the steel wool
    and the deep freeze! '

    <BR>Vicki, I think that what you are working on  <BR>is quite nice. I am fond
    of the 9, ? and the &#40;&#41;. <BR>I suggest old style numerals however. <BR>
    <BR>The transitions on the D are should be worked  <BR>on and I am sure you will
    work out your weight <BR>issues. &#40; Of your design that is.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    think I would also like to see a longer tail  <BR>on the Q.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    it. Good luck, See you around. <BR> <BR>-sean michael

  body: I think it looks quite nice actually, I think the A and the R should be modified
    to fit in a little better stylistically with the E, F, and P
