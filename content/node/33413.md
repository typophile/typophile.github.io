body: "Hello,\r\nI am looking for a very simple font but having a hard time finding
  something with a tad bit of personality also. I need it to be sans serif (mostly),
  perfect circle Os, and a soft organic quality to it. I have been using Gotham and
  Kurosawa sans so I am looking for something along those lines. I might try out a
  serif too as long as it doesn't feel \"heavy\" which is the problem I am having
  while using the more legible bold gotham. I don't think I want it too flowy, just
  soft, delicate.\r\n\r\n(This is my first time posting here so please excuse any
  breaking of protocol. I searched for this topic but wasn't able to find a particular
  posting so if it already exists, please do point me to it. Thanks!)"

    have perfectly circular 'o's. So depending on how important that criteria is,
    here are some soft, organic sans serifs:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Cronos\">Cronos</a>\r\n<a

      I like. The O''s are just not perfect circle enough :/ I might try it in the
