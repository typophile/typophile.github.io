  of Alouette:\r\n\r\nI just wanted to drop you a line to let you know I used your
  font Alouette recently in a collaborative piece with fellow typographers Sean Freeman
  and Alison Carmichael for the If You Could... exhibition which opens tonight in
  London. We took 3 pieces of graffiti that jumped out of us and made them into some
  beautiful typography and had them laser cut out of wood and applied them directly
  to the gallery wall.\r\n\r\nHere's a little write up on Creative Review's blog,
  my piece 'Obstruct the doors...' is around half way down the page, Alison's is the
  first image:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/january/if-you-could-collaborate-opens\r\n\r\nHope
  you like and thank you for creating one of my favourite font discoveries of last
  year.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nCraig Ward /\r\nWords are Pictures\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wordsarepictures.co.uk\r\n\r\n-----\r\nNeedless
  to say, I'm psyched! Thanks to Craig for using Alouette and thanks to Mr Meek for
  creating such a cool toy and tool.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alouette_woodtype_0_3653.jpg]"
