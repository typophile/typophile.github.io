body: "Hi, I'm designing an A5 booklet which has a big map legend that needs to fit
  on one page. What would be a narrow (i.e. condensed) font that works at 6pt or even
  5pt? \r\n\r\nI have been using Gotham headers and Mercury bodytext throughout. Gotham
  takes up a bit too much space and I don't like its condensed varieties at small
  sizes.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://photos.moniker42.com/photos/i-fbrQ9V3/0/L/i-fbrQ9V3-L.png\">"

  body: Great, thanks for that. Might see if I can find something narrower than Bell
    Centennial as I'm still pushing beyond the margins with Bell Centennial 5pt...
