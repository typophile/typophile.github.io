body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'd like to debut my last typeface called Mayonez,
  a serifed family that attempts to balance seriousness and friendliness. This type
  was thought for headings and big applications. I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nTake a
  closer view at <a href=\"http://www.behance.net/gallery/Mayonez/12663083\" rel=\"nofollow\">Behance</a>
  or purchase it on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sardiez/mayonez/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MyFonts</a>
  and save 50% until January 5, 2014.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nSergio Ram\xEDrez\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_poster_4649.jpg]"
