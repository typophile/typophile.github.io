body: "Hey All,\r\n\r\nI've got a strange technical issue that I'm hoping someone
  can shed some light on. \r\n\r\nI've got a document that was created in Quark 6.1
  using Scala Pro (with ligatures). To input the ligature (fi) I use \"Option-Shift-5\"
  and it comes up no problem. When I then open the document on Quark 6.5 its replaced
  with an \"R\" with a comma underneath it (R-Comma Accent in FontLab). If I open
  a new document in Quark 6.5 and use \"Option-Shift-5\", again, it brings up the
  R-Comma.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain whats going on? Do Quark 6.1 & 6.5 read codepages
  differently? Any help or insight would be much appreciated. Thanks All!"
