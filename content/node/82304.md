  body: "What is the origin and age of this sample, if you know it? And are there
    any other letters?\r\n\r\nThe short middle arm on the E& F is the only clue we
    get with these letters. You could save time and pick any heavy sans and edit the
    outlines of the E and F. \r\n\r\nSort of kidding, but maybe that would work if
    you know no other letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Well then my joking advice might still work. Without any letters to contradict
    a 'random' choice of a heavy sans, all you would need to do is tweak the E and
    F. The only 'standard' (classic) sans I can think of with a short arm like this
    is Franklin Gothic. If you found a heavy enough weight for that, you should be
    good, or you could make your own, as I described.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
