I was in the supermarket last week and had the chance to take a photo of the new PEPSI logo side-by-side with the old version (see attachment).

Do you feel it's a successful redesign? If you had to grade it, would would you give it? 

I've read reviews of this new logo on other websites and to my surprise I found that many people didn't like the change. For those who are wondering, the PEPSI circle is supposed to be a smirk (or smile face). There are two other PEPSI products that have similar circles, meant to express a smile, to a varying degree.

In my opinion, I love the new sans-serif geometric typeface in all lower case. I think it's forward-thinking. Does anyone know what font that is? The salient feature is that lowercase "e."

My score: A</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">I like that they've finally moved away from the gradients that plauged us for such a long time in "new logos".  I swear half the companies of the past ten years when they made a new logo all it was was the old one but with some gradient or 3D effect.  This is a nice evolution of the logo, and the font goes well with it.

I feel like it was a bold attempt, but was poorly executed. It seems to be throwing away a lot of the brand's historical connection. The Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist revamps are also bad, but slightly better than the various Pepsi labels.</div>

Pepsi and lame design have always gone hand in hand except around 1990 when they had the "UH HUH!" and the stripe theme cans going on. Obviously, the swoosh mimics the Coke swoosh. Pepsi has never had a good logo/can design. From the old wanna-be Coke style logo, to the 1960-1980s motor oil look to the 1990s techno . . . motor oil look.

Hey, Glenn. Just beneath the comment box where you insert text, there is a link that reads "Insert image". If you can't see it, you may need to upgrade to a newer version of the Flash Player.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think getting rid of the gradients automatically makes the new identity an improvement.

Personally, I think pretty much everything of the new logo(s) is poorly executed. The smile concept of the logo doesn't really work; it hardly resembles a smile. The only nice element I can see in these is that the logo changes for the different types of cola.

Then the typography... it just looks slightly off. It tries too hard to fit with the logo. But the waving crossbar of the 'e' is over the top. It's just one element too many in my opinion. The letters themselves also became strangely geometrical because they tried to fit it to the logo.

Underconsideration's [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/brand_new_best_worst_2008.php|'Best & Worst of 2008']] placed it on no. 1 of the Worst section, rightfully so in my opinion. More posts about Pepsi on Underconsideration [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_new_pepsi_challenge_guess.php|here]] and [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/pepsi_revealed_sort_of.php|here]].

It seems they are trying to follow [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_real_thing.php|Coca Cola]] again by going back to a more classic, retro look. Where Coca Cola succeeds, Pepsi fails.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're right. Their internal brand standards probably stayed constant, but the packaging identity is what is in question here. It is what people recognize (or don't) when they are scanning the aisles at the grocery. 

My question is, why have there been so many iterations of Pepsi's [packaging] identity including the logo? Plenty of design elements on the packaging can be changed without warping the logo. The logo, by the way, is the visual representation of a corporation and the building block of any strong identity. The changes in Pepsi's logo says to me that they are desperately trying break into some new demographic, struggling to compete, or trying find an identity that works. 

This hasn't changed much in over 100 years:

		<div class="commentbody">The mark itself didn't need a redesign, but the new asymmetry feels fresh. (@mili I laughed about the airline comment, I thought the same thing). To Nick's point, this really is a new identity system, not a logo redesign. It should be considered as a whole, and is a huge improvement over where they've been. All over the place. Pepsi now has some class, in its own way, without having to copy Coca Cola's retro (classic) look. 

As for the history of Pepsi-Cola, I agree it had some class back then as well. But when you're number two, you have to diferentiate and you have to try harder. Pepsi gets a high mark from my point of view on both counts.

I enjoyed discovering that the mark changes with each drink in the Pepsi line-up -- although subtly. The unity of the new Pepsi line makes the Coca Cola, Vanilla Coke, Diet Coke and Coke Zero brands seem disjointed by comparison. Consider especially how the caffeine free (gold) flavors have always been the ugly after thought of soda brands. Pepsi has made caffeine free as appealing as the rest, and if not, more appealing. (I predict a resurgence of gold and white, in part thanks to the new "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5_r786kUQ">white gold</a>" milk campaign.)

The advertising release on the other hand is odd to me. The advertising features a color palette foreign to any other Pepsi material (reminds me of Comcast's new FanCast site and palette). The advertising gives no mention of Pepsi, only vague references to love, sweet, pop, xoxo, &c. It generates intrigue, I'm sure as it's intended, but as Mili said earlier it looks like an airline mark.

		<div class="commentbody">Oh dear... I'm certainly not the alpha and omega of design taste, but I'm afraid it's elicited the same reaction as the one I had when I saw the 2012 olympics logo. I'm sure it's well executed, and the designer is now happy to have been paid, and to have the kudos of this work to his name, but I think it's just too generic, and typical of the neon curves that are so prevalent, and perhaps soon to go out of fashion (hopefully - I'm sick of them)... No doubt this is design by committee - it's too damned bland to have been one persons's vision. Looks like a supermarket own brand now.

		<div class="commentbody">am I seeing it right - did they actually make the "smile" wider or narrower according to the types of Pepsi? That doesn't make sense to me when you are branding a product. 

I think the fact that the Coca-Cola script has been around since the inception of the product says a lot about the strength of the design and the brand itself. Nevermind that you can trace the evolution of modern advertising and branding right back to the beginnings of Coca-Cola and how they marketed their product.

If anyone wants to know more about the impact of Coca-Cola and also Pepsi on the world, there's a documentary out there called "Cola Conquest" - it's really interesting.</div>

Totally awful. No meaning or symbolism are communicated to me... which leaves me to evaluate it on aesthetic terms only. Aesthetics: off balance, poor proportions. The blue whale-like shape is reminiscent of the old yin/yang design, which makes me feel like something awful happened to the old logo...  The sans serif lower case pepsi is undoubtedly a custom hand-drawn logotype rather than an existing typeface. The e is obviously a connection to the olf yin/yang symbol, and the humanist s would never accompany the geometric p and e in a credible typeface design.</div>

Logos establish identities, and it is a bit foolish to switch identities
without an excellent reason. But there is a phenomenon called executive fiddling
and this seems a prime example of it. 

My wife who does the shopping and drinks the Pepsi will pay no attention to the logo.
She likes the taste. I don't care much one way or the other. If I were doing the buying
and the drinking I would look for the caffeine free diet drink with the lowest price. 

If you have a new product trying to crack a market then obsessing over the logo makes sense. 
Coke, Pepsi, Mercedes Benz and Chevrolet should stick to the tried and true.

		<div class="commentbody">The Pepsi packaging changes have a more "generic" look and feel--especially on the Tropicana OJ.  At the supermarket, despite the fact that I prefer Tropicana over Minute Maid, I did not "see" it in the refrigerated case--and tried "Simply Orange" as a result. I am a Diet Pepsi drinker, and ditching the turquoise color makes finding the brand on the shelves a bit more time consuming.  
The scary thing about all of this is how many levels of management were required to approve the design.  Consider the mind boggling amount of money required to make packaging changes of this magnitude. 
I agree with other posters about the Oriental leaning of the new Pepsi logos--Anime-esque perhaps....

zzzzzz, wake me when they've spent another 2 billion to make it all better.

On a positive note :D
The wave of the logo reminds me of a simplified version of "The Great Wave" by Hokusai (1760-1849) OR Always Maxi-pads.

Kristen, You made my day with that comment! :-)

Maybe we should have another look at the Pepsi logo after we take a few Mydol tablets? (right now it gives me a headache :-)

		<div class="commentbody">When I saw this last year I asked a question about the way companies see there marks as a transitional reflection, upon the current. Like in the UK the channel 5 Rebrand, why? The sustainability within Graphic Design cannot be answered by Stock, ink, production areas. Instead it should be built on a foundation, where a mark is just. Not a fashion lead, trend based choice. Which is informed from a feeling or atmosphere of a time or place.

Seriously. Look at the before and after shot of the packaging. I didn't design this, and I'm no Pepsi apologist, but this is a big improvement. If you can't see it you're only looking at the mark and you're missing the point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha...man this thread is long! I think that for starters, the new design IS an improvement over the clutter and in your face graphic they had previously.

THAT being said, I'm not sure if it really suits the personality of the brand, and what they're trying to portray. 

On a personal note, the smile(and it's variations) is the cheesiest thing I've ever heard, most people aren't going to look at the size of the smile(white) to see which kind of pepsi it is, they will read the type. They should have stuck to one version of the logo and left it.

Which brings me to the type. I agree the "e" is a bit much. And the font choice could be better...

Overall rating: B</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At first glance I thought it was some kind of weird generic pepsi rip off. It took me a moment to figure out what was going on. Unfortunately, things like this are not really designed. The designer's intent generally does not survive committees and focus groups - both serving the lowest common denominator.

Good try though. E for effort.</div>

People in the design industry have to grow a backbone and be able to take harsh criticism and be able to explain the concept behind the rebrand. Either way hate it or love it they're getting some good publicity for the change in look, and I've heard way worse than my critique. That said I do think the new can is very cute and pretty, I'm sure they must have some strategy to try and attract more females to the brand so they gentled the design up, gave the type some sexy new curves, and voila!

Give them time to clutter it up with crap as usual! This always happens with packaging. The first use done by the design consultant is clean because it comes with the contract.  After a while though, the in-house guys get pressured by various corporate suits to add a myriad of crap and, wah-lah! congested traffic jam of doo-doo as usual takes the front stage.  

Now excuse me, I am off to my Mydol break with Kristen :-)

		<div class="commentbody">I have been complaining about the rebranding since it debuted. What strikes me is that all of the non-designers in my life (a fairly sophisticated bunch) are all giving the new designs a thumbs-up. "But… but… but," I stammer, "That's not clean and minimal! It's generic! It's got no personality. It's an un-identity!" Then I cross my arms, stamp my feet, and glare.

In my opinion, the worst crime of the new logo is that the asymmetrical swoosh (grin, whatevahyacallit) <strong>visually references Coca Cola's trademark Dynamic Ribbon</strong>. It's like they sliced off a length of it, encircled it, and—pow!—new logo. 

I understand what they were going for and appreciate that they attempt to achieve a more modern and mature sensibility. I like that someone, somewhere up the chain, wanted to defy what other beverage companies are doing and simplify their packaging. I like the consistency across the product line, something Coke sorely lacks. But as a whole I think the rebranding falls short.

That said, I actually think the Tropicana redesign and accompanying campaign ("squeeze") is great and is a nice step forward for orange juice branding and marketing. 

Same goes for the Gatorade "G" campaign, which abandons the now all-too cliché images of sports stars at the height of exertion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not feelin' it. The lowercase type is neat, and I really like its belching "e" throwback. 

But the circle mark is all wrong, from the multiple permutations across cola varities, to the awkward angle that makes it look like the old logo was put through a filter in Illustrator. I agree that simpler is better, and the new can/bottle designs look very sharp when on display in the store, but the logo lacks character and symmetry (which I tend to demand in logos. Call me old-fashioned, I guess.)

It's a solid application of a bland and half-hearted logo. Give me the mid-1980s logo any day.

		<div class="commentbody">A friend and I were actually discussing the new logo when we stumbled upon it in the supermarket a few months ago. I am a fan of the old logo and its two-dimensional look. But it has been around forever, at least as far as I can remember, so maybe my experience with pepsi is limited compared to those who are "older" than I am. I think that the new logo works better on some packaging versions more than on others. One thing that was off-putting to me was how on the regular cola packaging, the shade of blue that is used in the logo is different than that of the rest of the box/can. Whereas on the silver (diet) packaging it looks right at home - clean, modern, time for change. Pepsi Corp. has been revamping several of its logos and packagings lately. And while some enjoy the little swerve that the 'e' has, imitating the circular logo with its 'swoop', I really, really don't like that at all. Had I been in the room when they were making decisions on this I would have insisted that they not change a thing.</div>

It deserves nothing more than the lowest grade possible for a) the poor design, b) the poor branding decision to replace their ubiquitous logo rather than to *slightly* modify, ALA AT&T, with said logo and c) the inconsistency of even implementing the poorly wrought and poorly envisioned logo by changing it on every can.

		<div class="commentbody">Saw this thread and figured I'd chime in with my .02 cents although some of you are looking to have this thread end. However, [[http://www.brandpackaging.com/CDA/Articles/Packaging_that_Sells/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000504262|Brand Packaging]] has an interesting ad/article featured on page 40 of last month's issue regarding [[http://www.glowelle.com/home.html|glowelle]] by Nestle. There seems to be a shifting to what is referred to as Beauty Juice. It's possible that Pepsi may be considering the jump to a different audience.

The new design may be more palatable to an older crowd rather than the younger generation fixed on energy drinks. While I think the old design was great for a more "sporty" look, this one may just look a bit dull up against other brands with bold reds, and yes...the use of gradients and shadows. But if the move is to produce a product more appealing to a different audience, then it's a good move; if not then it won't get much attention save for those who prefer the contents rather than the image. 

Glowelle's bottle was created by [[http://www.vitro.com/vitro_corporativo/ingles/portada.htm|Vitro]] and the bottle design by [[http://www.kuproductions.com/|Kenneth Ussenko Productions]]. 

I would rate this design logo at a 6.5 adn the type layout at a 7.5 on a scale of 1-10 for many reasons already listed here in regards to the icon and typeface used. </div>
