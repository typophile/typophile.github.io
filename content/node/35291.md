  body: Odd 's', but it's gotta be a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Times%20Bold&sample_text=User%20Convention&sample_size=48">Times</a>.

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-europa/\">Times Europa</a>
    has an 's' more like the sample, although the 'r' looks slightly off. Concorde
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/concorde-nova-bq/\">Concorde
    Nova</a> are also pretty close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
