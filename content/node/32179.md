  body: "Interesting, I've been looking for a font with a \"typewriter\" feel.  I
    just took a look at the Lineto and Optimo fonts and found a couple that look good,
    but they're too pricey.\r\n\r\nAnyway, in my research I found one that you might
    want to take a look at, it's <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html\">Bryant</a>
    from <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/\">Process Type Foundry</a>."
