  body: "A few years ago my sister needed to sign a legal document and she grabbed
    a random pen, unaware that it was her son's pen with disappearing ink. A few days
    later the lawyer called, baffled that her signature had vanished. \r\n\r\nFortunately
    there were no legal consequences, but she had to sign it again."
