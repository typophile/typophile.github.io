body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Oblique or Sloped Roman</strong>\r\n\r\nOblique
  or Sloped Roman letterforms are sometimes incorrectly called [[Italic|italic]].
  Like italics, obliques are used to offset, or give emphasis to, certain parts of
  a text otherwise set in upright [[Roman|roman]] type. \r\n\r\nOblique styles may
  also be called slanted roman since they are the same letterforms found in the roman
  face but have been slanted. In some instances they are mechanically slanted (where
  a slant is created by the font software) or hand-drawn slanted by the designer.\r\n\r\n[[Italic]]
  letterforms (sometimes called \"true italics\" to further distinguish from obliques)
  have been drawn so that they are more formally differentiated from upright roman
  letters.\r\nAdrian Frutiger\u2019s [[Frutiger]] uses obliques in lieu of Italics.
  But Frutiger Next (from [[Linotype]]) has italics, for example.\r\n\r\nThere are
  various schools of thought about whether obliques or italics are more proper for
  the emphasizing of text. [[Stanley Morison]] was briefly in favor of sloping letters
  instead of true italics. The divide may have begun at that time.\r\n\r\nMost desktop
  publishing and word processing applications will slant the roman on the fly if the
  italic or oblique style of a given font is not available. It is considered incorrect
  in professional design and publishing circles to use artificial obliques in this
  way.\r\n\r\nMany [[Sans Serif|sans]] faces have accompanying obliques rather than
  italics. For example, [[Univers]], [[Helvetica]], [[Futura]] and [[Gotham]]. Some
  modern sans faces are being designed with custom drawn italics, such as Nexus Sans,
  Trebuchet MS, Myriad, etc.\r\n\r\nFor more about the visual characteristics of italics,
  see the wiki entry for [[italic]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional Articles:</strong>\r\n[[Obliques
