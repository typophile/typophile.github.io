  am having an issue when generating it.\r\n\r\nApologies if this has been asked numerous
  times, but I would appreciate the help. \r\n\r\nI've kerned all my individual pairs
  to a point I'm happy with, but when I generate the font it seems that the changes
  aren't taking place. I'm viewing in Linotype Fontexplorer. I've also tried activating
  the font and testing it in Illustrator to check, and I still don't have the kerning
  I wanted.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

    than browsing it with Font Explorer?'
