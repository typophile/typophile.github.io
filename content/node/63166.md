body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am looking for some experienced logo designers to share their
  experiences of how they actually go about selecting the typefaces and comparing
  the typefaces in the process of creating their logo designs.\r\n\r\nI'm doing quite
  a few logos designs at the moment and I guess it's a habit I have developed, but
  after identifying the general requirements for the logo (what sort of style and
  feel I am trying to go for based on the client and their audience), I generally
  like typing out the characters that will appear in the logo in plain black and then
  make lists containing 5-10 copies (about 100pixel high each) of the characters and
  then go through and change the typeface for each, then compare and critique and
  get a feel for what I think will make a good choice and then experiment with the
  chosen typefaces with other design elements within the logo itself and eventually
  eliminate the type choices I have.\r\n\r\nJust interested in how others go about
  setting up the process of comparing and choosing the typeface they use while in
  the process of creating the logo.\r\n\r\nIs it the first thing you do, is it the
  last thing you do? Do you make lists of fonts to compare or only select a few, if
  so what size do you set them up at? How many versions of the logo do you setup on
  your screen at any one time?\r\n\r\nThose are the sorts of insites and thoughts
  I'm after, always trying to learn and always try to improve, any help would be great.\r\n"

  body: "I am certainly not the most experienced designer, but I definitely have a
    strong philosophy when it comes to type. I really believe in identity design as
    solving a problem and not simply aesthetic -- I always approach logo design thinking
    there is a \"right\" typeface, and not just one that I like or prefer.\r\n\r\nOver
    the years I've started to pick up on what different typefaces are communicate
    and how. For example, serif typefaces tend to come off as more serious and traditional
    than sans-serif. Italicized text tends to have a feeling of movement or progress.
    Rounded type feels casual. Condensed-width text has always seemed to portray growth
    or power to me -- it carries a lot of energy.\r\n\r\nThat kind of understanding
    is really helpful in cutting through the clutter. Instead of scrolling through
    the fonts I have available, I now tend to decide in advance what I'm looking for.
    A project might need a humanist sans-serif in a condensed width, and that narrows
    down my options considerably.\r\n\r\nIf you're not already to that point with
    your convictions, spend your time analyzing the typographic choices good designers
    make. Why did they choose that face and how does it communicate their message?
    Also, critique poor design and consider what choices you would make instead.\r\n\r\nHope
    something I said helped!\r\nMatt"

    selection. I grabbed the list of [[http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/articles/25-classic-fonts-that-will-last-a-whole-design-career|25
    classic fonts]] from Chris Spooner's site and haven't looked back. I try to stick
    close to those, as I feel they are some of the most timeless ones out there, but
    every once in a while I have a client that steers me away from them.\r\n\r\nThere's
    always consideration for some of the new fonts on the scene, like Gotham- it seems
    to be a pretty popular choice right now that I think could have some serious staying
    power as the years go on :)"
