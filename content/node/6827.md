    German company, and it may be a nice alternate, as well.. Maybe try a search for
    &#39;Miele&#39; and &#39;Free Font&#39; at Google.. <BR>  <BR><i>&#40; &#42; Personal
    disclaimer.: I dont know who created and / or designed it, and I am not sure if
    its based on an existing, commercial typeface.. Just to be aware.. &#41;</i>'

    BORDER=0> As a Belgian &#40;and in extenso European&#41; citizen <BR>I don&#39;t
    believe in all this preemptive nonsense and rogue type  <BR>identifier crap. <img

    only thing you can&#39;t do is knowingly link to a rip-off or  <BR>specifically
    ask for one. If you don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t know. The  <BR>worst thing we
    might do is edit out your link and replace it with  <BR>a link to the &#34;clean&#34;
    version if we find out it&#39;s a rip-off.

    <BR> <BR>There are also a couple of free versions &#40;which I don&#39;t believe
    are rip-offs, just different digitizations&#41; -- one by <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm">Dieter
    Steffmann</a> and also &#34;Phat Phreddy&#34; by <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/p.htm">Nick

    target=_top>Paris Bold</a> is not so bold but with similar style too I think.
