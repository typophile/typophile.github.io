    a crew of dirty cops came along and beat it down with ugly sticks for good measure.

  body: Well, it's not the most elegant combination of forms I've ever seen, but I
    can see where there's a idea going on by using some Indic script in the middle
    of an English word for a movie set in India and the U.S.

  body: Even a seductive perfume needs a musk or other 'stink' to grab your attention.
    Movie makers don't care about getting the font right. They want attention. That's
    the right attitude to have if you are them. I think your wrong about this one
    Patty & James. Not because it couldn't be better somehow. I agree it could. But
    because you have failed to grasp the real purpose of the poster & are thinking
    about type in a kind of abstract or pure & therefore unapplied way. This poster
    will work in part because of the 'stink'. Thinking about type outside of it's
    context or use is pointless.

    I don't need a lecture. But think of how much more attention it could have grabbed
    if that 'a' had been beautifully executed.\r\n\r\nBesides, if you want to 'stink'
    you don't use Trajan."

  body: For Bengali it's a nice enough mark. The real shame is that they didn't try
    a more calligraphic Latin type to help the two scripts blend together better.

  body: "Using Trajan as a movie title font is like using Times Roman in a print ad.
    It does not distinguish itself or cause notice. It just slips into the white noise
    of the usual stuff you see all the time and snore over. Mixing an Indic script
    with a Latin is a good idea but ideas die when the execution kills them.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Re-reading my post I can see why you felt lectured to. \r\n\r\nI apologize.
    \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I still think you have your arguement the wrong way
    round. So I'll just agree to disagree with you about that. \r\n\r\n<cite> But
    think of how much more attention it could have grabbed if that \u2018a\u2019 had
    been beautifully executed. </cite>\r\n\r\nI agree with you that there are many
    other effective strategies that could been used for the poster including ones
    that would have been more aesthetic and/or less conventional.\r\n\r\nI just don't
    think you should discount the one they used so quickly - and especially not for
    purely typographic and aesthetic reasons. I am saying there may be method to the
    maddness. And maybe a stinky feeling is 'right' given the story being told. I
    don't know the story - so I can't say. \r\n\r\nCertainly I agree that her films
    have been pretty wonderful!\r\n\r\nAlso re: Trajan. Trajan just means 'it's a
    movie'. That's not much more than 'not causing notice' but it is a little more..."

    me it is actually a little less. It means to me that they didn't even think about
    communication or grabbing your attention. It means they just went with the default
    because it was there and doing something that communicates might involve actual
    thought and a bit of work.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"
