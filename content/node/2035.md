    a good &#39;contemporary&#39; alternative would be Meave&#39;s <a href="http://www.kimeratype.com/tipogaleriarondana.html"

  body: Thanks a lot for the replies, it looks like it might be Blippo Bold, but I&#39;ve
    only found Blippo Black and it&#39;s much too solid. The L&#39;s and G&#39;s are
    wrong also. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/blippo/black/testdrive.html?s=THE%2BLONG%2BGOODBYE&amp;p=48"

    <BR> <BR>But along the way I&#39;ve found some other very nice fonts. Thanks for
    your help!

  body: Wonderful! Thank you Mark. Shame it&#39;s not digitized. Apparently it was
    part of a collection made specifically for movie credits.

  body: It used to be very widely available back in the &#39;70s on headline setting
    machines and rub-down type. One among a relatively small universe of choices back
    then. You used to see it everywhere. I always thought it was slightly goofy, but
    aptly named. Sort of a hippy-dippy take on art deco.
