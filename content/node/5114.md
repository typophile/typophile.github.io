  body: Hector, it seems EL is more important than GRANJERO. Have you tried to make
    the shape around Granjero larger and reduce EL down and incorporate it into the
    shape also knocked out. I like the pea pod shape nice and organic

  body: I think the &#34;R&#34;s need bigger heads, and the &#34;O&#34; is way off.
    <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;EL&#34;, you could try doing a black/white in/out effect
    with the border of that background, if you know what I mean&#42;. Or what about
    a cursive lc form? <BR> <BR>&#42; Sort of like the stuff in the TypeCon2004 logo,
    or some of Muller-Lance&#39;s fonts <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
