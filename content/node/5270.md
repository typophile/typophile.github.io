  body: How did you find that? I did a search of &#34;futura&#34; on MyFonts and it
    wasn&#39;t listed. Very strange.

  body: It&#39;s a dirty little secret, but that&#39;s why they call it &#34;MyFonts.&#34;
    What shows up for you is often extremely different than what shows up for someone
    else, say, Marc. It&#39;s based on a number of factors, including shoe size, hair
    color, and how good you were back when you were seven years old, among others.
    &#40;Frankly, I was surprised at the one regarding right-handedness, left-handedness,
    and ambidexterity, but all the other ones seem appropriate to me.&#41;

  body: Chesh, I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for this version of Futura, with its
    &#34;obese x-height&#34; &#40;as Hrant might put it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Mark, I had
    a hunch it was the Maxi version, so I used that word in my search term. But you&#39;re
    right, it doesn&#39;t come up in a search of &#34;Futura&#34; alone. <BR> <BR>Also,
    to amend my ID, the version I linked to is from Agfa-Monotype, not E&#43;F &#40;although
    I&#39;d swear I&#39;ve seen a version from them, too&#41;.

  body: Marc, you might be interested to know that I will soon be digitizing Phil
    Martin&#39;s Fotura Biform family, which is also based on Futura. It has an even
    more &#34;obese&#34; x-height than Futura Maxi. It also has &#34;biform&#34; or
    &#34;commoncase&#34; alternate caps which are like giant lowercase characters
    the same size as the caps. Sort of the opposite of small caps. It&#39;s going
    to be a lot of fun to do.

  body: Mmmmm, commoncase/biform -- sounds tasty, Mark. Can&#39;t wait to see it!
