body: Anyone knows a good way to automaticly make round corners on glyphs? Illustrators
  function is crap, as far as i can tell, and FontLabs is only working when making
  an automatic bold...

  body: If you don&#39;t mind working in Illustrator, the <a href="http://www.cvalley.com/products/xtreampath/index.html"
    target="_blank">Xtream Path</a> plug-in has an outstanding round corner tool.
    It can do lots of other neat things, too, but the round corner tool was the main
    reason I bought it.

  body: 'Tobias: I agree. FontLab really needs this feature. According to Yuri, this
    feature existed in 2.5, but only worked with corners of straight lines, not with
    curves. &#40;see <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/18930.html?1066778915"

  body: I remember the FL 2.5 version. It worked quite nicely, within that limitation.
    Not that I ever used that funtion on a real project, mind you. <BR> <BR>T

    corner tool.

  body: "If you work by the centerline method in CorelDraw, round corners are as easy
    as selecting  Outline Pen, Corners Round. It works with any shape or kind of line.
    The only problem\u2014which is slight\u2014is when paths with obtuse angles are
    converted to curves: the radius tends to be a little shallow, but can easily be
    tweaked."
