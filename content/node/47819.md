  I know it's not a lot of letters to go on, but the R is pretty distinct.... I was
  initially heading towards News/Trade Gothics but the O's on those are upright and
  not as round. \r\n\r\nIf it helps, their secondary fonts are Frutiger and DIN"

    be able to get away with News Gothic Bold (shown)\r\n\r\nor Franklin Gothic Demi\r\n\r\nEach
    letter is squished or stretched as necessary."
