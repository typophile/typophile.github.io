    is right.  ;-)

  body: "Please give reasons. I've been using Suitcase for years. I did stray when
    Adobe had ATM - which was great. But they never updated it for System 10.\r\n\r\nToday
    I tried FontExplorer - and I am so sad I did. I've lost several hours of work,
    while it had a font conflict between a job I did a month ago in Quark 7.02 and
    ITC Kabel and the system font Chicago. It took many, many hours -- starting, restarting,
    killing preferences, removing XTensions - till I could figure out the problem.\r\n\r\nAnd
    that I have not had before with Suitcase. But what ever the damage was -- Suitcase
    also felt the pain...."

    several programs went nutsy on me. I finally have Suitcase back in play, but when
    I go to Microsoft Word - it quits out in seconds. The error report says Error
    Signature\r\n\r\nI have uninstalled - used \"Remove Office\" -- removed everything
    possible - and reinstalled. Powerpoint is fine. But not Word - and well, I hate
    to sound like a crybaby -- but I have a need for Word (right now) -- I'm about
    to edit the articles that have arrived for our Oct/Sep issue of the magazine...\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone have any idea what I can do to get Word to work again? \r\n\r\nAnd I am
    writing it here - because it was fine till I installed and try to use Font Explorer...."

    cleaning up of standard font folders like /library/fonts? It doesn't really sound
    like FontExplorer's fault ... I hope not, anyway!

    I always run Win Mac in safe mode because it's otherwise too slow -- no idea why.
    Dreadful software!

    Jackie,\r\n \r\nThank you for contacting Quark Crash Help Support.\r\n \r\nThe
    issue you are facing is seems to be arising due to a third party XTension named
    FontExplorer X for XPress 7.0.xnt.\r\nPlease disable the same and then try to
    replicate the issue.\r\nIf that resolves the issue I would request you to reinstall
    the XTension\r\nI would also request you to share the document you are working
    on and also the corrupted XTension before you remove it, for the testing purpose\r\n
    \r\n \r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n*******\r\n\r\nI wish I had known that extension
    was in there - I probably just needed to remove it and it would have saved me
    many a headache...."

    I had to restore from cd. For my tastes it is overactive and uninstalling it does
    not undo the changes it makes to your files.\r\n\r\n"
