  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>I just discovered this site, and have been reading all the postings. I realize that this is an ancient, dead message thread, but I felt moved to respond. <BR> <BR>I would absolutely prefer 'micro-(newline)electronics'; I find 'microelec-(newline)tronics' awkward. Just as you'd break a word between syllables, not arbitrariy, I'd prefer to break any kind of compound word between parts, in the most comprehensible place possible. A second point is that I'd also prefer to have the whole word 'electronics' instead of just 'tronics' widowed on the new line. <BR> <BR>Ignoring the line break, this is how you'd read it - which is more natural and comprehensible? <BR> <BR>micro-electronics <BR>microelec-tronics <BR> <BR>Hrant, based on your comments, you might enjoy Francis Crick's book THE ASTONISHING HYPOTHESIS. Crick is one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA. The 'astonishing hypothesis' is that the mind is a manifestation of the physical brain. Crick specifically uses visual perception to illustrate this; it's a subject that fascinates me, as I'm sure it does many people here. <BR> <BR>The signals from the retinas are sent directly to thousands of specialized visual-processing areas. Each processor looks for one very specific thing - a certain kind of horizontal line, a vertical line, diagonals at certain angles, certain colors. If a processor gets a match for what it 'looks' for, it sends a signal to the next level of processors. Eventually, a three-D model is constructed. You can look at an object on a tabletop, close your eyes and still reach over and pick the object up, because you have an accurate mental model of where that object is in space. <BR> <BR>We're extremely good at spotting patterns - when we look at a dashed line, we see it as a line, not just a bunch of individual dashes. We instantly see an implied shape just by seeing parts of it. We're not confused when shapes are broken up - we can look through a multi-paned window, and we're not confused that our view is chopped into small rectangles. We can easily distinguish between individual objects even in a very cluttered scene - these things are all amazing. Most of the work of figuring these things out is done by these dedicated processors, working at a very low level. <BR> <BR>There also seem to be processors that respond to anything remotely resembling a face - that's why something as abstract as <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> is seen as a face; even the grill and headlights of a car can easily be seen as a face. <BR> <BR>The way that these processors work also explains why we are easily fooled by certain kinds of optical illusions. <BR> <BR>My favorite illustration in the book shows two clusters of outline circles like perfectly round 'O's. In the first group, all are complete except for one broken circle, which has a 'C' shape. The broken one instantly jumps out of the group in the first glance - you couldn't possibly miss it. <BR> <BR>The second group is just the opposite: all circles are broken except for one. The one complete circle does not stand out at all - you need to hunt for it. The brain has high-speed, automatic tools for spotting broken geometric shapes, but not to automatically spot a complete shape among broken ones - you've got to work at that by brute force, examining each circle. <BR> <BR>Which, coming around to a typographic topic again, suggests that some letter shapes work because they take advantage of the brain's built-in ability to automatically spot broken shapes - we're hard-wired to recognize the apertures in a letterform. <BR> <BR>Thanks to another thread in this site, I now know how to say 'Tschichold' correctly - I've been asking people this for a long time. My guess would have been something close to 'shick-old,' so I've saved myself some future embarrasment. <BR> <BR>Take care, <BR> <BR>- Paul</div>
