    question, but creating something inbetween the regular and condensed width is
    not a huge task."

    one can do this in 2\u20135 days from the scratch, he must be really good. I would
    have said, this needs two or two and a half weeks for the basic Latin alphabet
    at least \u2013 exclusively the kerning and only, if you are very experienced."

  body: For a client I generally quote 3 weeks for an original individual weight.
    Week one the basic glyph set (UC, lc, figs, punct.), week two the sorts and accented
    glyphs, week three the final productizing. Spacing and kerning are part of the
    process throughout. If there are multiple weights and MM is used, it shortens
    the timeframe considerably. But then I work sort of fast.
