Does it read well, or does one feel like they are in a book-form of a David Carson dream?

		<div class="commentbody">VAS, regardless of what your end opinion of the book is, is worth $50. It's not a book that you're supposed to read page by page. It's more like a meandering. It's pretty cool, but I'm sure a lot of people get ticked off by the fact that is anything but typical. If I had one word to describe it I'd use *insane*. <BR> <BR>Tomasula doesn't follow a genre, he does &quot;writing as a contemporary/conceptual art form.&quot; <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~andnow/"> Check out his &amp;NOW Writing Festival</a> from last year. I won't take credit for that stylin' logo. <BR> <BR>This is an interesting post because Tomasula works at <a href="http://www.nd.edu/"> Notre Dame</a>, where I went to school, and I did a project for him when I was a student. Currently, my former professor and I are working on the next Tomasula book, entitled The Book of Portraiture. We just started (reading) so I don't really know what it's going to look like. It does start with the origin of handwriting, so I think I'll be asking some questions here in the next couple months. I don't imagine it being of the magnitude of VAS, as it's a different publisher and the budget is *quite* different&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;I haven't read the whole thing,&quot; said Dan with a hint of embarrassment. <BR> <BR>I don't have $50 and only possessed it for a day or two, so, I don't know how its literature holds up. I can't say I dig the &amp;NOW stuff 100% and the idea of &quot;doing something just to do it&quot; (kills me), but Tomasula's reputation is pretty solid. And I don't think Farrell would wrap art/design like that around a pile of crap. Also, if you like when characters' names are the names of shapes then you're sitting pretty. <BR> <BR>Additionally, <a href="http://designobserver.com/"> Design Observer .com</a> lists it as a &quot;book they recommend.&quot; I imagine that's where Tiffany got her link? <BR> <BR>Also of note is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226807401/qid=1106622895/sr=8-7/ref=pd_ka_2/104-4692125-8770327?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"> Amazon has the book in soft-cover</a> now.

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany Wardle : I purchased the paperback version due to difficulties ordering the cloth cover. But I am thinking of purchasing the cloth cover so I can treat this copy with contempt and error, and I am a poor student. <BR> <BR>Personally, I fell in love with the idea of a novel being constructed visually from a typographers translation and relationship with the author.  <BR> <BR>I do think it reads well. But I may be more tolerant towards the design than others. But even if someone did not enjoy the read, I think it worth populating any collection.  <BR> <BR>Chris Rugen : Steve Tomasula is not infamous for his ability to write empty literature.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/VAS_homepage.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/VAS_homepage.html">http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/VAS_homepage.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>This link may help define VAS more for you.
