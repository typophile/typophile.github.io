  track it down from an invitation I had borrowed from an older friend. Unfortunately,
  I did not write the name of the font down and it is driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone ID this font? Sorry about the pixelation, but the scan I did years ago was
  not very good and I can't find the original at this time.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRebecca\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rebecca4_4006.JPG]"

      nothing found so far. I will try to find the original and re scan for a better
      image. \r\n\r\nI understand the freaks comments, although I am not as adicted
      as some, I do enjoy the varieties and the challenge.\r\n\r\nRebecca"
