    is probably a good choice.

  body: 'I recently saw a newsletter/sales piece done in <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/site/font_collection.php">Fedra
    Serif</a>. It had a very fresh, contemporary look without being too impersonal.
    Clean like a sans without being a sans, or being too stiff. Some of the large
    size stuff and the italic didn''t look as good--perhaps they used the wrong one
    (there is a and b)--but overall I was impressed how well it succeeded in being
    fresh without looking too self-conscious or slick.  '

    guess it depends on what you are looking for and i'm sorry but <em>progressive</em>
    can be a pretty vauge term. especially when you are talking to designers who are
    constantly dealing with people who want something that looks <em>contemporary</em>
    or <em>progessive</em>.\r\n\r\ni am probably coming off kind of negative, which
    is something i don't want to do, but i think it's important to define what it
    is you are looking for (in general) so that everyone has a better understanding.
    if you can't quite describe it (which is probably why your asking in the first
    place), begin with perhaps a list of things that you associate with what you are
    thinking about. what other things (non type related) do you think of when you
    think <em>progressive</em>?\r\n\r\n2\xA2\r\n\r\nwell, back to Easter weekend with
    the in-laws\u2026 wish me luck ; )\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks for all the suggestions guys.\r\n\r\nyeah istich.. i guess progressive
    is probably too vague a term. basically i'm looking for serifs that give off a
    \"modern, hip, vibe\" but not so much so that they look like they should belong
    in a art mag. something i could use for body copy for .. say.. a newspaper entertainment
    tab, or a special section on culture.. that type of thing. \r\n\r\ni've just been
    wanting to mess around with (re)designing some publications like this, and i've
    just been sort of stuck on what to use for body copy.. i want something that's
    a little edgy, but still easy to read. but not some newspaper staple like new
    century schoolbook, you know?  \r\n\r\nfor example.. i'm thinking of something
    like vista sans or freight for section headers and/or headlines. or possibly whitney...
    or even flama. if that gives you kind of an idea for the vibe i'm going for.\r\n\r\nhopefully
    that kind of articulates a little better what i'm looking for here. "

    the other hand, news 706 and utopia seem a bit too old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nany other

    what harrier ... would look like in this instance?\r\n\r\nIn what instance? If
    you mean this exact text/layout, if you provide an InDesign file (or even just
    an EPS with the text as text, not convert-to-outline-ed) I'll set it in Harrier,
    sure. Just one thing: Harrier has four -close- weights, but no italic (or you
    could possibly use Patria's italic as its italic - they have the same slope though).
    The point however is that you can use the Demi to mark emphasis in a body of Regular
    (or really any other combination you prefer) like the TYPO magazine boys do so
    well with Nimbus (and did so well with Patria, for my article in #13).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMrs
    Eaves: I wouldn't recommend it unless you go the trouble of respacing it*, since
    its color is very spotty as it stands. I liken it to a beautiful, captivating
    woman... with a speech impediment.  :-/\r\n\r\n* BTW, is it true that James Montalbano
    once did that? Maybe just a rumor.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    serifs have this copy/paste look, where a funky form of serif gets pasted onto
    letterforms that started out as sans (sanses?). \r\nNothing wrong with that, but
    traditionally serifs 'grew' organically out of the stems and so on. So, if you
    ask me \u2014 any serif with slapped-on-distinctive-little-(uniform)-shapes is
    contemporary.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cts."
