  body: Tiff, when first starting to design types, it makes sense to start with constructed
    types, as they are easy. They are to type designers as "Smoke on the Water" is
    to guitarists.

    too.\r\n\r\nAre you looking for a constructivist face ;-)"

  body: Hello people out there, I'm new to this site but I would really appreciate
    some help. Ive been searching for an actual constructivst typeface, (not a modern
    version) but a true old one. Could anyone tell me where to look for one of these.
    Any help at all would be most appreciated! Cheers.

    in digital form? Or are you looking for letterpress type (wood or metal)?\r\nI
    have just finished designing a Constructivist type based on a 1923 Weimar Bauhaus
    poster.  I attempted to make a faithfull version but it was done 2 days ago so
    it isn't exactly \"a true old one\"--I can post a PDF sample when I get home this
    evening.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the modern versions mentioned above may suit your needs.
    \ The \"Modernist Pack\" from P22 has numerous styles to choose from.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
