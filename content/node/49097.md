body: Anyone have suggestions for a typeface to accompany <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/"
  title="see it on MyFonts">Museo</a>? We're open to either sans or serifs. It's being
  used for a budding photographer in San Fransisco. Initial design of his website
  can be seen at <a href="http://www.gurrydesign.com/portfolio/prokopetsstudio/">gurrydesign.com/portfolio/prokopetsstudio</a>
  (if that helps). We're looking for a font to use with collateral material such as
  pricing sheets, business cards, etc. On the website we're using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/cambria/">Cambria</a>.
