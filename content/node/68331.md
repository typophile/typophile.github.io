  Apart, particularly the sections on exactly which typographic features E-book files
  should and must not contain. (Of the latter: Ligatures, hung punct, hyphens.) I\u2019m
  sure that Bringhurst apologists, who are a lot like Ayn Rand apologists, will fulminate
  with rage at  what I have to say about the em dash."

  body: Thanks for an interesting and useful article, although the words about 'Bringhurst
    apologists' seem rather beside the point in this time and place.

  body: Rather like Allied soldiers, who vowed to fight Jerry at every turn, Bringhurst

  body: Far from fulminating with rage I take note of the fact that em dashes are
    not used in the setting of Elements of Typographic Style. En dashes are used,
    surrounded by spaces.
