  stories. Trying to find a book face with similar dark color and natural line quality.
  I've been considering Bitstream's Fleischman\u2014but it's just a touch too light\u2014and
  Farnham\u2014but it's somewhat sanitized. Might attempt to thin out the chosen Signs
  to match Fleischman, though that feels like sacrilege. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for
  a book face with the right color and natural feel?"
