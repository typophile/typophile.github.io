body: 'So I totally have this plan to be the ultra-niche Nick Denton. Unfortunately
  my name has far more syllables but I&#39;ll try to live up to his example. <BR>
  <BR>Thus, some new projects of mine, currently undergoing extensive testing: <BR>
  <BR><a href="http://www.hewnandhammered.com/pho" target="_blank">www.hewnandhammered.com/pho</a>
  <BR><a href="http://www.hewnandhammered.com/eats" target="_blank">www.hewnandhammered.com/eats</a>
  <BR> <BR>which will soon have their own domains, and perhaps more attractive mastheads.
  <BR> <BR>My own skill could not possibly match that of the beautiful &amp; talented
  Mark van Bronkhorst, who made me a great piece using his own Verdigris, which I
  find quite useful &amp; have been availing myself of on a daily basis for awhile
  now: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.hewnandhammered.com" target="_blank">www.hewnandhammered.com</a>
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also working on <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.mocosanfrancisco.com"
  target="_blank">www.mocosanfrancisco.com</a> <BR> <BR>and of course that old standby,
  my favorite, <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typographi.com" target="_blank">www.typographi.com</a>
  <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, if anyone has ideas of niches that might warrant a site and
  fulfill the following criteria: <BR> <BR>a. audience must be own/use personal computer
  &amp; internet &#40;this is why hewn &amp; hammered is not such a success; i missed
  this most important rule&#41;; <BR> <BR>b. audience must have disposable income
  <BR> <BR>c. audience must have time to contribute - as the entire idea here is to
  get these things self-sufficient to the point where i don&#39;t need to take much
  time editing, and can leave most of the content creation up to a group of 2-3 dozen
  individual authors. <BR> <BR>d. niche must be somewhat approachable and of interest
  to hobbyists/amateurs outside the professional practice, if there is one. <BR> <BR>e.
  each site needs a catchy name &amp; attractive identity or is not worth producing.
  <BR> <BR>f. and of course there needs to be some available content on the Internet
  - hopefully lots of disparate little bits all looking for some glue to hold them
  together. <BR> <BR>i was thinking of one for people involved in GIS - cartographers
  and planners and the like - they spend a lot of time on the &#39;net, work mostly
  on computers, professionally network just as much as folks in our own trade. <BR>
  <BR>any ideas?'

    Post a site with your self promotions and let people decide wiether they want
    to visit them. May you have good fortune.

    just looking for ideas for new sites. Since I put my back out I&#39;ve been working
    a lot less in the garden and on the Vandercook and need something to do ...  <BR>
    <BR>Didn&#39;t realize this was the wrong place for it - I thought this was the
    &#34;anything goes&#34; forum. Sorry! <BR> <BR>I see now, reading through the

    I&#39;m sorry for that. Won&#39;t happen again.

    using ArcView. She is now dating a Linux guy though, so who knows, she might move
    over to <a href="http://grass.itc.it/">GRASS</a>. Also check out this site on

  body: '&#40;blushing&#41; Didn&#39;t think anyone noticed, BJ. Thanks! <BR> <BR>Actually,
    my brother Aaron operates Paste Design. &#40;The type/design thing must have a
    genetic component!&#41; I work for a custom publishing company called McMurry.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t know the folks at Metaleap, but they responded quickly
    a few years ago to a colleague&#39;s question about their type choices.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, magazineculture seemed a little daunting before the blog explosion
    - I wasn&#39;t sure I could handle the demands of keeping a site interesting and
    updated by myself. But I could see it working along the lines of typographi.ca,
    where a small group of contributors makes sure things stay lively. <BR> <BR>Hmmm...
    may have to revive the idea. Would you be interested in being a contributor, BJ?
    Anyone else?'

  body: Hey guys! The magazine culture/design/gossip/type/... blog seems a great idea.
    I don&#39;t know of anything similar, apart from the trade websites or the SPD,
    which are all very bussiness oriented in my opinion. <BR> <BR>The audience is
    potentially very big, try to think of a designer who doesn&#39;t like magazines,
    any magazine. Plus there is a big untapped area also on editorial photography,
    set design, ...which could be easily connected.
