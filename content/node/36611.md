body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI know next to nothing about typesetting and found this site
  from Wikipedia.  I have an idea that I think requires some unusual sorts and I would
  be extremely grateful for any help this group could provide.\r\n\r\nThe organisation
  I work for, QMI Solutions, has a semi-experimental machine called an Incremental
  Sheet Former.  You can see an article on the technology here:\r\n[[http://www.qmisolutions.com.au/article.asp?aid=160]]\r\n\r\nIt
  works by using a solid stylus (e.g. 20mm diameter ball nose) to form metal over
  a plug.  In those pictures it's making our stock demonstration piece, \"The Face\".
  \ The CNC control means infinite flexibility from CAD models.\r\n\r\nWhat I would
  like to do for our demonstrations is to form \"The Face\", then have the name of
  whichever company it's for to be formed as well.  Now that I've done my 10 minutes
  research on Wikipedia, I think I at least know the words to use to ask the questions:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\nI
  would have a forme with say a 12 character capacity on our plug.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The
  sorts may be around 50mm/2 inches in height.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The font would suit
  tracing with a 20mm ball nose tool (possibly a smaller tool could be used), which
  means there are no tight concave sections.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Because the metal is
  being pressed over the font it needs to be \"right way around\" instead of mirrored.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>For
  bonus points, the font is designed such that there is a common joining point between
  all the letters so that the outline of a word is continuous rather than having to
  trace each letter individually.  This may mean the font is a script rather than
  a print, or it may mean there is a design feature like the lines joining characters
  on car badges.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>For even more bonus points, the set is available
  commercially or second hand somewhere.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Now I'm stuck.  Would
  anyone here be able to point me in the right direction?</strong>\r\n\r\nIdeally
  we would be able to buy a set from somewhere (anywhere!).  Alternatively if 2D or
  3D CAD models (or even font files) of a suitable font could be obtained we could
  have them machined.  I would have to find out how many of each character is a good
  number.\r\n\r\n2D or 3D CAD shape definitions (in whatever format) would be required
  so that we could created the toolpath in our CAM software.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for any help at all,\r\nJames McIntosh"

    a custom font for you to best met your needs. Custom solutions are usually expensive\r\n\r\nMike
