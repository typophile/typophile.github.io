body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo Good small_5585.jpg]\r\n\r\njust wanted
  to confirm that i picked the correct fonts for this.. for the top text I came up
  with, ITC Garamond Std Lt Italicised then for the lower text I went with ITC Garamond
  Std Book also Italicised.. The bottom text is probably wrong but I think it should
  be a subtle substitute. What do you think? "
