body: I wanted to get some strong opinions on this face before I release it. I realize
  there&#39;s no market for this type of font so I&#39;ll be realizing it free after
  I construct the italics.  <BR> <BR>This font currently serves as the identity face
  for my Web site and print materials. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

    make an entirely new <BR>font derived from it. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just so lovely
    - it has the same charm <BR>that Newlyn&#39;s incomparable Democratica has. <BR>It
    just needs a little work on the ear. <BR> <BR>BTW, your &#34;j&#34; &#40;and a
    few of the other glyphs, <BR>to a lesser extent&#41; also has that same great
    <BR>atmosphere - go with that - and I think you <BR>might even be able to sell
    the results too. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Why did I post this inside San Serif?! Anyway, that&#39;s what I get for
    writing drunk.  <BR> <BR>Maybe we need a slab-Serif section? I do plan on making
    a Sans-Serif, or Grotesque version some day. Its almost a grotesque face already..
    ?  <BR> <BR>Hrant, I know just what you mean. sometimes I wish I could just slap
    this face into something else. One idea; I thought maybe I could make a stencil
    version, or something like that in concept. I want to break it apart some and
    follow the curves of the g. '

  body: ' Max <BR>The fonts looks good but yoir site &#40;especially some works&#41;
    are really nice. <BR>Not sure why do you use 1 side serif in some uppercase and
    why both side serif in others. '

  body: ' Good question. I think it had less to do with logic and more to do with
    character and balance. Or maybe both.  <BR> <BR>I started with the lowercase &#39;d&#39;,
    then the &#39;g&#39;. To me, the beginning and ending character is the most important
    part of a trademark, so I worked hard on those. The &#39;d&#39; had an upper straight
    serif too, as well did the rest of the appropriate characters once I completed
    the first draft. Then I drafted the uppercase with even serifs too.  To make a
    long story short, the whole thing was F&#42;@&#42;d up. The lobes were too short
    and the bowls were narrow. the ears and tits were unusually long. I redrafted
    the whole thing, normalizing and balancing it along the way.   <BR> <BR>I always
    knew the &#39;hth&#39; in &#34;diphthong&#34; was going to be problematic when
    put together.. most people don&#39;t pick up &#40;read&#41; the first &#39;h&#39;,
    they think dip-thong, but I think that has more to do with psychology and the
    way we read things.  Regardless, I wanted it to blend together so I dropped all
    the upper straight serifs on the lowercase only so the &#34;D&#34; has standing
    power.  <BR>For the uppercase, the logic for why some have serifs and some don&#39;t
    is purely just me. It follows my handwriting.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the compliments,
    Alejandro, your work and site is fantastic too. '

  body: ' Cool face. The organic surprises make this design worth while. <BR> <BR>I
    really enjoy the contrast of the amorphous bulbous protrustions and the techie
    geometrics. My first reaction upon seeing it was that the inconsitencies in line
    widths would make for a bumpy read &#40;the s feels thick compared to the r, for
    example&#41;, but upon examining your sample copy, I think it works great &#40;from
    what I could see on screen&#41;. The numerals seem to lack some of the quirky
    flair of the lower and upper cases. '
