  body: "Thanks Ryuk, for mentioning my previous comment on the lettering on the sheet
    music cover being hand done. I should have repeated my observation that everything
    on the cover is lithographed or engraved.\r\nNone of the fonts mentioned are an
    exact match and most are much too wide, except for Spire and possibly Bordeaux.\r\nIf
    anyone wants to compare the sheet music cover to Ian Party's Grazia and L'Officiel,
    note that the links mentioned no longer work, but a specimen of Grazia can be
    seen at http://typecache.com/Ian_Party/ The website http://www.ianparty.com/ is
    not currently available.\r\nDon"
