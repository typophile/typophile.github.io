body: "The latest issue of Wired used this interesting gothic inline for their article
  on \"Fail.\" I've seen similar faces other places, including work for Whataburger.
  I know this might be just some fancy stroke work, or overlaying a thinner face on
  top of a heavier one, but I'm still holding out for it just being one face. I've
  included some samples from the magazine. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://drp.ly/6ImeX\r\nhttp://drp.ly/6In5m"
