  body: 'EDIT: Matches a font called Middleton from mid 1990s. That appears to be
    a knockoff of <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=Florentine&q=Go">Florentine</a>,
    which was published by The Font Company in 1992.'

  body: "Florentine goes back farther than that. The Phil's Photo \"Homage to the
    Alphabet\" book from 1985 shows Florentine as a film type. Looking further, it
    also shows up in Mac McGrew's book on \"American Metal Typefaces of the 20th Century\"
    as an ATF typeface from the late 1890's called Florentine Oldstyle.\r\n\r\n- Mike
    Yanega"
