  of some sort on it \r\n3. email it back to smith.traci@gmail.com (or put it back
  on here as a word document)\r\n\r\nTHE RATIONALE/EXPLANATION... \r\nso it's the
  middle of finals week at princeton, and i'm trying to make some speaker name tags
  for a conference coming up (sounds simple enough, but not for me, because i don't
  know what i'm doing!) i love good design, and i hate it when things are cheesy.
  (which makes this EXTRA frustrating...)\r\n\r\nso now it's 4 am and i'm getting
  NOWHERE. i thought i'd put the challenge out to you all. i've seen your work; it's
  amazing. (i lurk around these message boards all the time) i am quite certain you
  can do something in 15 minutes that i've been trying to figure out for 4 hours.
  (i'm not kidding) here's the template, in microsoft word (i know, i know, seriously!)
  all it needs is some way to designate that the nametag belongs to a speaker, and
  not an attendee... a banner across the top? the word \"speaker\" at an angle? i'm
  not kidding about how easy this should be, i just don't know how to do it, and so
  i'm having a nervous breakdown. \r\n\r\ni'll pick my favorite one, and speakers
  all over princeton will be thankful they don't have to wear a hideous nametag for
  3 days...\r\n\r\nit has to be done by 4pm tomorrow. \r\n\r\nPS, if you want to change
  the fields for names, that's fine, they just can't move around at all (because the
  princeton theological seminary logo is in the whitespace...)\r\n\r\ni'm hoping this
  works, or i'm just getting out a sharpie, seriously :) \r\n\r\ntraci \r\n\r\nPS
  the conference is a conference about human rights, and i'm a student who's not getting
  paid to do this work (lest you worry that this newbie is trying to use you to do
  my work...) "

  body: "Traci,\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of questions I have\u2026\r\nFirst of which
    is how many speakers and how much time are you willing to devote afterwards to
    complete the design (cutting mainly). And although you say the conference is on
    human rights, is there any specific area that it is geared towards or specific
    groups speakers that will be talking about different aspects of the topic?\r\n\r\nMatthew

  body: An easy and simple way would be to use a different background color on the
    speakers' tags. I've seen this done in a conference and it works quite well. One
    can distinguish speakers and attendees at a distance.

  body: "Matthew, \r\nThe conference is called \"Theology, International Law, and
    Torture: A Conference on Human Rights and Religious Commitment.\" Most of the
    attendees have a religious affiliation (Either Jewish, Christian, or Muslim) as
    do many of the speakers, but some do not. Most of the key note addresses will
    focus on ethical issues related to torture, but other human rights issues will
    be addressed. \r\n\r\nGood idea about using different colors, Mike and I would
    do that, but I was specifically asked to have them contain the word \"speaker\"
    in some way. \r\n\r\nTMS"

    preclude that you can't do something else, too.\r\n\r\nI've attached two images
    here below showing how the word \"speaker,\" plus a simple color difference, could
    do the trick. Obviously, the design is a bit conservative, but you are from Princeton

    you're told\" thing. but these labels are already going on a pre-printed \"Princeton
    Seminary\" label thingie that looks way busy and can't handle more colors... (it
    already has a blue bar at the top and bottom) \r\n\r\nit just needs to say SPEAKER
    on it. i swear! i promise! i love that your design has it at the \"most awesome
    conference in the world\" though, because it IS going to be the most aweseome
    conference in the world if I have anything to say about it :) \r\n\r\n"

    small caps for the Ph. D.? Wouldn't you use small caps only is the whole word
    is in caps, or wouldn't you place the H in small caps as well? Is this is personal
    preference, or is this the way to do it?\r\n\r\n\r\nLex fori."

  body: "<em>off topic, but\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nNo, probably not. But I always wanted
    to try it. Robert Bringhurst spells the \"G\" and the \"H\" in the Germany corporate
    abbreviation \"GmbH\" (Gesellschaft mit beschr\xE4nkter Haftung) with Small Caps,
    which looks really funny to me, since I never see it like that (well, I have some
    German books from the 50s that do it, too).\r\n\r\nLike I said, I've always wanted
    to try it. But if it were my print job? No, I doubt it."

    have to be too big. People won't read it from more than a yard away anyway. And
    just their wearing nametags, you two target groups, will be almost notice enough.
    I mean, how many people walk around Princeton all day wearing badges?\r\n\r\nYou're
    almost thinking about this *too hard,* Traci, although\u2014on the other hand\u2014I'm
    glad that you are thinking about design at all. I wish that everyone would pay
    this much attention to detail, especially at a place like Princeton."
