  on the hunt for a potential replacement for Adobe Caslon for magazine body copy.\r\n\r\nWe'd
  like to have something a little narrower ideally, to save space, and it would be
  nice to freshen up the characters. I've done what has felt like a lot of research,
  but have come up disappointed by the lack of Caslon-esque oldstyle faces available\u2014especially
  in a useful range of weights. I think the closest thing I've come to an enjoyable
  solution is Sabon Next.\r\n\r\nAnyone have other ideas or info about anything being
  currently worked on?\r\n\r\nAppreciate any direction"

    and it is also worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nSabon Next would be a 21st Century
    <em>Garamond</em>, so whatever its merits, it is not what you seek."
