  design of Graublau Sans Pro took Georg Seifert over 5 years. With 7 weights and
  over 1000 glyphs per style, Graublau Sans is a type family that suits all typographic
  tasks. The regular styles have a rather clean and neutral appearance. The italics
  on the other hand, have a vivid design based on handwriting. For the use in headlines
  or logotypes Graublau Sans Pro offer 6 additional display styles with rounded corners
  and tighter spacing.\r\nBeside the typical western codepages, Graublau Sans Pro
  also supports Greek, Cyrillic, CE (Central European) and Turkish. There are also
  several sets of figures available: oldstyle figures and lining figures (both proportional
  and tabular), small caps figures, fraction figures, subscript and superscript figures
  and figures inside circles.</cite>\r\n\r\nExclusively available at fonts.info:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info/info/en_graublau-sans-pro.htm\r\n\r\n"

    been so many new releases in this vein over the last several years that it's hard
    to get excited about another one, as accomplished/polished/complete as this one
    is.\r\n\r\nThe expressive italics are a nice touch, and should help distinguish
    this face from other similar efforts."

    me wonder if I should continue working on mine. After 4 years of work, it is hard

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nKeep working on yours. Yes, the Graublau Sans is lovely. Yes,
    there is a humanist sans fatigue among certain people. But remember that the Typophile
    community is a tiny fraction of the type using public, and one never knows what
    captures the public's attention. Four years is a long development. It may be best
    to work faster, release quicker, and then move on to the next design. Paraphrasing
    something I read about poetry, \"Type design is never finished, only abandoned.\""

    down by Typophile?  Naaa....\r\n\r\nYour Now Sans is lovely, and even though it
    resembles other humanist sans, I found something very special about it. Also remember
    what Matthew Carter said at your critique at TypeCon: Finish this one first! \r\n\r\nI
    love Froggy more, but probably you should listen to Carter and not me :) "

  body: "My comments weren't meant to discourage further releases in the humanist
    sans vein. And in part they reflect the fact that I spent the last 3 months looking
    at dozens of humanist sans as I searched for one to recommend as my employer's
    new corporate face.\r\n\r\nBut I think the sheer volume of offerings available
    in this genre means that new releases must work harder to be noticed, whether
    that's in design, features or marketing."
