  out the credits is a particular typeface that i can't identify... you can see a
  sample here:\r\n\r\nhttp://disney.go.com/disneypictures/wall-e/\r\n\r\ni have found
  this one that appears to have been inspired by the movie, but i can't tell if it
  was commissioned for the moive... does anyone know?\r\n\r\nhttp://davidocchino.com/portfolio/typography/galax-e.html\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "David Occhino creates typefaces based on movie lettering then passes it off
    as work \"inspired by\" movie and theme park lettering, without specifically mentioning
    the work off of which it is based. Technically I suppose that it's original work,
    but it still seems sleazy to me. I would guess that the lettering in the titles
    for WALL\xB7E is custom."

  body: "thanks guys\r\n\r\n@bobbygrotesk - yeah i've looked at gunship, and it's
    close, but i have not seen any mention of pixar using it as the basis for the
    wall-e type. also, i'm more interested in  finding out the genesis of this type,
    than in copying it.\r\n\r\n@DrDoc - yeah, i kinda guessed that was the case...
    oh well..."
