body: I&#39;m wanting to pick up a nice color proof printer for my home office. The
  basic requirements would be 11x17 support &#40;preferably 13x19&#41;, individual
  ink cartridges, broad paper support, and under $1k.  I didn&#39;t include extremely
  high quality, because I&#39;m mostly printing graphics as opposed to glossy photos.
  <BR> <BR>There seems to be a new crop of printers from all the major manufacturer&#39;s
  geared toward &#34;graphic professionals&#34;  recently. Does anyone have any experience
  with any of the following printers? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/ProductQuickSpec.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1938925413.1045174549@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=eadcghdfeghlbfdmcfjgckidnf.0&amp;oid=20306147&amp;category=Ink%2BJet%2BPrinters">Epson

  &#40;slow, decent quality&#41; and EPSON Photo 1280 &#40;one very expensive ink
  cartridge&#41;. Both of which confine me to expensive Epson brand papers, which
  limits my ability to proof some projects. I realize I am limited in the ink-jet
  arena in that respect. Maybe step up to a $1500 Xerox Phaser? <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?

  body: that ain&#39;t large format man. that&#39;s just printers. sigh....thought
    you were talking bout our billboard makers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say screw Epson.
    your gonna pay a fortune in cartriges. We have a Xerox Phaser 7700 at work and
    have contests with our print reps to see who&#39;s proofs match better. We win
    all the time.
