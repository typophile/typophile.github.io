  beautiful Leftloft's posters for Teatro del Scienza?\r\n\r\nThis \"T\" looks different!
  Maybe a unicase typeface?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.leftloft.com/projects/teatro-scienza/\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: "Alex, the T is similar, but that is almost the only part that matches. <a

    does not have E, S, G, etc. like the sample on the poster. \r\n\r\nI thought of
    the Shire Types by Jeremy Tankard, but it doesn't look like any of them overlap
    these details. Still a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
