  to a few pages. Something about 10pt that looks serious and professional - which
  of these would be the most comfortable to read at that size - Garamond, Scala, Joanna,
  Perpetua...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'To answer this question, you need to include other variables, such as the
    measure--the length of line--and leading. Generally the problem on A4 or letter
    sized paper is that for a single column the measure is too long. And why do you
    specify 10 point? '

  body: At 10pt, I would go for Garamond (I am looking at the Adobe Premier Pro version
    btw). Perpetua looks great but has a smaller x-height, which probably makes it
    less comfortable to read.

  body: "Scala is beautiful and comfortable to read. It's the typeface used by Ellen
    Lupton in her book 'Thinking with Type'. Scala has a generous x-height and has
    contemporary qualities which I think is refreshing.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"http://www.elupton.com\">Ellen
    Lupton's website</a> for her comments on the book and Scala. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "It might sound like the designer's disease*, but Scala may actually appear
    'too big' at 10pt...\r\n\r\nWilliam's right in that the line length and leading
    determine readability; Ellen Lupton's book is not stationery-sized, and therefore
    her typography (including the choice of font and the measure) reflect this. In
    fact one could take any of Jeff's four font choices at 10pt and make them all
    completely <em>unreadable</em> with bad-enough decisions on line length and leading.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    the software gives 1/5th or 20% the point size as 'auto leading' which is too
    close \u2013 particularly for sans serifs. The other thing, as William says, is
    that a single column on letter or A4 is too wide. For 10pt Scala I'd be looking
    at a line length of around 106mm (assuming everyday English, rather than technical
    English or a text with lots of long words) which implies margins of around 55mm
    either side on a letter-sized document.\r\n\r\n*generally the client wants the
    text set bigger, the designer wants it set smaller..."
