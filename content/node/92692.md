  \"Hell no.\" \r\nI want to own the copyright. But why will they want to work with
  me to finalize the development of the font, if they will only have the right to
  sell it for a few years? They must figure that I will be taking my font with me
  and leaving at some point if I am only licensing the font to them. Is there really
  a lot in it for them to put their resources and energy into helping me finish it,
  if they figure (and figure right most likely) that I will leave them and take it
  with me at some point, if I can - Jeremy Tankard style?\r\n\r\nI've heard some designers
  who say they sold the copyright to a foundry and regretted this because it could
  have made them more money if they hadn't, over a period of 10, 15, 20 years or more.
  Especially as they gain notoriety. \r\n\r\nIf they want to own my font I'm saying
  no. I will only license it."

    buying your design.\r\n\r\nUnless you\u2019ve really got your finger on the pulse
    of what every font buyer has gotta have at any moment, you're not going to get
    rich making fonts for a living. However, with the right PR, you could get famous.\r\n\r\nJust

  body: "If you don't have the knowledge and skills to polish a typeface yourself,
    then it is probably worth selling to a major foundry, *if* they will really hold
    your hand and help you.\r\n\r\nThey also likely have better distribution and so
    forth, and will get you a lot more exposure. Which will help the sales of your
    subsequent fonts.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the tradeoff is taking a significantly
    lower percentage than if, for example, you went through MyFonts.\r\n\r\nThen again,
    it may be a bit presumptuous to assume that a major foundry will *want* to go
    that route if you can't submit a really polished piece of work. Adobe for example,
    apart from typefaces they commissioned for language support goals or other specialized
    purposes, only bought one outside design in the last five years I worked there.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "\"I want to own the copyright\"\r\nThis really depends on whether or not
    you (yourself) are legally and financially, (to begin with), prepared to defend
    the copyright. Also, if the font software is evolving over time, the copyright
    can be complicated. \r\n\r\nThe trademark, which is where long-term value accrues
    in successful design and marketing, is what I think you want ownership of. "

    designs to foundries. AFAIK very few of them actually participate on Typophile.

  body: Also, for the most part they aren't beating down the doors of would-be type
    designers. If owning it outright is their standard approach, and you say "no,"
    they will say "great, find another foundry to distribute your fonts."

  body: "Thanks for all your advice everyone. I'm starting to shy away from foundries
    now and think I may go the reseller route instead. I'm looking at a contract right
    now for distribution through a distributor. Essentially I would be licensing it
    to them for a certain period of time, and when that is up I would like the ability
    to take the font away from them if I want to. I'm trying to keep as much control
    as possible. It seems like they are trying to take as much control away from me
    as they can. They have a lot of things in it that I don't like that I've told
    them I want to change or remove.\r\n\r\n@dberlow - If I sign a contract with a
    foundry or reseller and it says that during the term of the contract I'm licensing
    the font to them, they may trademark the name of the font in their name, do you
    know if they can they use this to take ownership of the font from me? The trademark
    is just the name of the font, but how much power will this give them over me?"

    Knowing and defending your rights is great, but I have to say you're sounding
    too antagonistic to have a fruitful relationship with any such partner. That said,
    some partners are better than others, so I would simply ask which ones people
    recommend, and whether they've been taken advantage of by any font house or foundry.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In general, I agree with Hrant. (Checks Bible against signs of the apocalypse,
    nope, it\u2018s not on the list. Whew!)\r\n\r\nHowever, fundamentally, if you
    want to really \"own\" the font(s), then you do <strong>not</strong> want your
    distributor or foundry partner to own the trademark. You may think of it as \u201Cjust\u201D
    the name, but if the typeface does well, then there will be equity (value) in
    that name. It\u2019s what people mostly refer to the typeface by. Taking your
    outlines elsewhere will become of less value to you and future partners if the
    name doesn\u2019t come with them."
