  body: Hmm. My old link for the Foundry doesn&#39;t work any longer. Looks like you
    can contact them <a href="http://www.on-idle.com/foundry/" target="_blank"> here</a>
    - but there&#39;s no online purchasing options :-/

  body: 'Thanks, I did &#34;request information&#34;. Unfortunately The Foundry isn&#39;t
    as quick with it&#39;s responses as your average Typophile moderator. You&#39;d
    imagine they&#39;d either be selling their font through their own site or licensing
    another provider &#40;like fontshop&#41; to sell it. '

  body: Keep us informed about the Foudry situation if you  <BR>don&#39;t mind. I
    haven&#39;t got a clue how user-friendly  <BR>they are, but I&#39;ve got serious
    doubts. That&#39;d help us  <BR>help others at future inquiries about Foundry
    types.
