  body: Boy, if that O didn&#39;t look so square, I&#39;d be sure it was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/bold/testdrive.html?s=OVENDIGITAL&amp;p=16">Futura
    Bold</a>. It&#39;s like the bastard child of Futura and Eurostile.

  body: Boy, doesn&#39;t that look like the bastard child of Futura and Franklin Gothic.
    I think the characters in the sample are a bit more square than that, though the
    O looks like a better fit. <BR> <BR>That Futura really gets around. Slut.

  body: Many thanks to you all! Both Futura and District are VERY close. Pity about
    the squareish &#39;O&#39; - it&#39;s close in Eurostile Bold, but the other rounds
    are too square, and the &#39;N&#39; is downright ugly &#40;what do I know?&#41;.
    <BR>I fear Dave is right about Futura being too promiscuous... I&#39;ve found
    105 offspring so far. Is this a record? <BR> <BR>Thanks again! <BR>GW
