  body: "Hmmm...\r\nI hadn't looked at specimen of Banco in ages except in older font
    catalogs. Wasn't really aware of the added lowercase:\r\n\r\n<em>Excoffon did
    not design a matching lower case alphabet for his capitals, but this was accomplished
    later by Phill Grimshaw, who also designed the light weight. He deliberately 'underdesigned'
    the lower case forms, producing a more reserved alphabet based on the design ideas
    of the original.</em>\r\n\r\nMe gotta say dat me no like the lowercase dat much

  body: I think Eis am Stiel is hand drawn -- it would really surprise me if it were
    a font.
