body: "help help help!\r\n\r\ni'm trying to find the perfect text (and alternate display)
  typeface for a magazine i'm designing. i know that's a tall order, but suggestions
  are welcome.\r\n\r\nthe magazine, which showcases artisans and the places they're
  from, is oversized (10x15), and i'm playing with using very tall, narrow text columns.
  the other face i'm using, mainly for display, is HTF Knockout.\r\n\r\ni need something
  that has an old-fashioned 'french' feel, probably a transitional face, and a lot
  of character. i have tried garamond 3, cochin and new caledonia (see below), but
  none is quite right. why? cochin: love the text face, hate the italic. garamond:
  too common. new caledonia: a little boring.\r\n\r\nto top this all off i'd love
  for the face to have a display weight with either ultra high stroke contrast or
  or an ultra light weight.\r\n\r\nHELP!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HE_typesample_5204.gif]"

    i want to see this typeface in a mag, prominently \u2013 http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/borges/\r\nand
    Knockout is so multi-style, that this combo could work also, \u2026 it depends.
    Might be to colorful for the nice quirky Knockout Series \u2026\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
