  its a long time since I actually posted anything, almost a year, but spend an hour
  or so on Typophile every morning when I get into work and something is troubling
  me... personally : )\r\n\r\nNow, Id like to say upfront, I dont mean to aim this
  at anyone in particular of course, but having had a quick look over the various
  forums just now, so not really counting the past 3 years I've been a member, in
  mainly the Design, Critique forums, the standard of some of the design work is awful
  and its clear for all to see! Sometimes I have to wonder if the user who has posted
  whatever it might be is having a bit of a joke! This is a community of people who
  have the eye for detail and considered, well executed design, whether that be logo
  or layout, spacing of letterforms, kerning, hinting... just bloody choosing the
  right face for the job... the list goes on. Some of the posts from users asking
  about there work... my god, some of the logos... Absolutely shocking. I've had a
  discussion just now in the studio about this, and being the only one who is addicted
  to this website on a constant basis, I have to fight it its corner, but for god
  sake, have a close look at your work before posting it and asking whats wrong, when,
  if its not clear at that point to some extent, your in the wrong industry! Naturally,
  some users aren't designers, or work in an agency as such and just create for the
  need to create, which is great, as do we all, but to those who do work in the industry...\r\n\r\nFeel
  free to ask me to point out the works I've seen, as I've built up a library on my
  desktop for this moment, should you be in doubt, but secretly, I know none of your
  are, and, I know you know the point Im getting at if that makes any sense. I dont
  know what else to say really as I dont want to come across as a negative person,
  but being in the industry and knowing of the constant pressure, if any of our juniors,
  seniors or even the management produced some of the rubbish I see on here, they'd
  be gone. I suppose I just 'expect' from Typohile, being what it is of course, the
  information and resources that come from you lot is just mind blowing really. Please
  consider your work right up until to the last minute before posting. Im only really
  after discussion, not war. \r\n\r\nIts just been getting on my t*ts for sometime
  now and I finally broke this morning, and, for the record,  I'd like to clarify
  that I mean no offense to any of you, and, on a positive, the typeface design and
  build section of the site, is pretty 'chokka' with fresh exciting, forward looking
  work.\r\n\r\nRant over... Awaiting flack... : )\r\n\r\nxx\r\n\r\n "

    in typography specifically, and design in general. It also attracts those new
    to the field, who are just learning and may make mistakes. Occasionally crap gets
    posted. What I really like is those cases where the experienced designers help
    the juniors along, and the crap evolves through various stages of less crappiness,
    and finally becomes a workable design (if not a master piece).\r\n\r\nIf you want
    a forum composed of only experts, you will have to go somewhere with juried entrance
    requirements. Don't look for me (I probably wouldn't pass the jury anyway) because
    I think it would be completely boring."

  body: "> This is a community of people who have the eye for detail and considered,
    well executed design...\r\n\r\nI tend to find that the people within this forum
    and that make up Typophile as a community generally do have a 'eye' for design
    and well executed design, as I have mentioned, some of the development of typefaces
    on here have been an inspiration to all and I have come across some first class
    type design work. I saw something the other day and I swear the chap that posted
    it must of been having a laff!\r\n\r\nI think everyone who feels part of Typophile
    would describe themselves as having an 'eye for design' or otherwise they wouldn't
    become part of the community which involves so much 'attention to detail' : )\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your reply Don.\r\n__\r\nRez\r\n"

    A place where top designers can help mediocre designers.

  body: "I'm not blown away by everything posted on the Crit boards either \u2013
    but they're Crit Boards, not Showrooms! Typophile is a great place for learning:*
    Yes, there are some very good designers in here; and some of the best of them
    are the ones that don't think of themselves as Good Designers in a way that would
    put them above helping beginners.\r\n\r\n* Which means crits shouldn't be too
    feelgoody/cuddly, but I personally don't think that's a big problem here."

    a good idea) posted in crit (be it a logo or typeface) and then being able to

  body: "\"Top\" designers don't post their work in the crit section because (a) they
    don't need to, and (b) they are busy making money. I agree that there is a preponderance
    of amateur work in the crit section. But on the other hand, I'm not a professional
    design teacher.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was starting out as a designer and I
    felt like I had nowhere to turn and no one to help me and it was a struggle to
    learn the basics. And now I realize I should have been posting my work here to
    get help. It is a testament to typography's central role in design that Typophile
    probably has the most supportive design community on the web.\r\n\r\nMost of us
    have a lot of room for growth. And I know I am one of those people."

    wouldn't be as useful if most of the stuff was high quality! The main things that
    do bother me are:\r\n\r\n1) When not enough people who are able to give a good
    crit do so.\r\n\r\n2) When people ask for crits on logos that are not at all typographic.\r\nAnd
    then too many people oblige!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: There are so many places online where you can see beautiful work -- I've got
    my ffffound account, my google reader, my dropular button in my browser, a friend
    emailing me some amazing new thing, 20,000 tumblr blogs -- I do not feel like
    there's any shortage of amazing work to be seen. What makes typophile still relevant
    (1 among many reasons) is that with 10 bajillion blogs, many of them very good
    and maintaining top quality content, there's a place for 1st year students to
    post their god-awful projects and get genuine feedback. Quite often, you can scroll
    to the bottom of the thread and see that they're vastly improved, and once in
    a while, you can see something that's really, really good. I started posting here
    as a student, and I found it really helpful. Of course there is work posted that
    is beyond any hope, but I'd say the majority of people posting are genuinely looking
    for help, and they're not posting their best work -- they're posting the work
    that needs some extra eyes on it.
