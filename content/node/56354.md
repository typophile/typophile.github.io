  think I fell in love with a notebook, and \u2014 it's not a Mac. This would probably
  be the very, very first PC I would choose over a Mac. It almost seems like someone
  left the Apple Design Team to work on the Adamo design. ;) Niiice.\r\n\r\nSo, If
  anyone at Dell reads this \u2014 Come on, sponsor me with one of those, you know
  you want it. ;)\r\n\r\n<em>(* I am not getting paid for this. Of course I am not.
  Actually, I wish I would. Even better yet, I would accept an Adamo as payment. ;)
  So consider this, Dell.)</em>"

    I respectfully would like to point out that you've been influenced by a nice ad
    campaign. A nice-looking machine running Windows is still running Windows. Sure,
    Apple hardware is attractive, too, but for most Mac users it's the experience
    on the whole, not just a pretty computer.\r\n\r\nAnd before this turns into the
    inevitable computer war that always ensues, please consider keeping it relevant
    to the original post (see above)."

    get me wrong, I really, really like Apple as a brand \u2014 well, mostly, Apple
    as a hardware manufacturer and Mac as an operating system and the whole design
    aspect of all of these. But, as I noted, this is the first really nicely designed
    PC 'thing' I've seen/noticed, yet. (And it could run some Linux as well, doesn't
    have to be Windows, I guess.)\r\n\r\n"
