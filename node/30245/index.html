<p>Has anything happened since Fontlab bought and rereleased Fontographer that makes Fontographer worth learning? And since I&rsquo;m doing this on my own (my school doesn&rsquo;t teacher lettering or type design) and won&rsquo;t do anything but display types for at least a few years, should I just start with Typetool?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my opinion FontLab is the only choice even though I kind of like the retro feeling in Fontographer. I started with Fontographer at first (some months ago) and would have probably stayed with it if the application only had a couple of updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Better screen/preview resolution. I got tired not seeing the glyphs with a good resolution directly in the app. It felt very old style (but had a charm none the less). In FontLab you see the letters much more clearer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenType support (to be able to produce OT-fonts with it).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If these two things got updated while I had the app I would probably continued using it for a while.</p>
<p>BUT&hellip; in that case I didn’t have had the opportunity to see all the other great tools that FontLab offer. It’s loaded with helpful tools that makes things so much more smooth when working with the fonts.
In other words, I recommend FontLab if that wasn’t clear :) Not that you automatically make better fonts with it, but just because it’s a very helpful tool no mather what kind of fonts you intend to produce.
And not to forget, OpenType. Trust me, you will want to add OpenType features to your fonts. OpenType is a fantastic development in the font area – making almost everything possible.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is a longish answer. I&rsquo;d been using Fontographer since version 1.-something. When FontLab 2.-something was released, I got a copy. I worked in Fontographer, but when done, ran the font through FontLab to clean up all the bugs in the file Fontographer had introduced. I finally moved to FontLab entirely with version 4.something. It is a much better program, but I still find it harder to work on characters (as opposed to FILES).</p>
<p>FontLab is a wonder for new-kids or programmer-savvy folk. As such, the support you can get sort of assumes these skills. But as my programmer partner says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the world has gone; learn or go under.&rdquo; Sadly, I agree. Get FontLab.</p>

<p>You can downlad a demo version of FontLab Studio or FontLab makes a lighter version called TypeTool:</p>

<p>&ldquo;TypeTool is our basic font editor for Mac OS and for Windows. For students, hobby typographers and creative professionals who occasionally need to create or customize fonts.&rdquo;

<p>TypeTool sounds perfect for what I want to do &ndash; in the past, when I&rsquo;ve needed to mess around with something very minor, I just put it into Illustrator, but listening to the chat here, I think I want to try my hand at this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Metalfoot,</p>
<p>TypeTool not only &ldquo;leads into FontLab&rdquo;, it also includes FontLab&rsquo;s technology under the hood. The FontLab engine has been tested very extensively in professional font production by most of the top font foundries of the world. TypeTool includes the same engine, it just has a simpler user interface and some limited functionality. (The currently shipping TypeTool 2 is analogous to FontLab 4.6, the upcoming TypeTool 3 will be based on FontLab Studio 5&rsquo;s engine).</p>
<p>FontLab has been known for very good autohinting, and the same technology is included in TypeTool, while FontCreator apparently does not. TypeTool supports both Type 1 and TrueType fonts, and allows drawing in both Bezier and B-splines mode, while FontCreator only supports TrueType and B-splines, as far as I know. On the other hand, FontCreator has integrated autotracing for which you need ScanFont when working with TypeTool.</p>
<p>The .vfb files saved out of TypeTool can be passed on to a production partner using FontLab Studio 5 who could then generate state-of-the-art OpenType fonts. Altneratively, you could generate a Type 1 font out of TypeTool and then use TransType Pro with Microsoft VOLT or the free AFDKO (Adobe FDK for OpenType) to turn that Type 1 into a fully-functional PostScript-flavored or TrueType-flavored OpenType font. This is something that is not so easily accomplished with FontCreator (since it does not generate fonts with PostScript outlines).</p>
<p>I work for Fontlab Ltd. so my opinions may be biased.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I also recommend TypeTool for a new user. Traditionally, some type designers worked in Adobe Illustrator to draw glyphs and then moved them into one of the aforementioned tools for additional work. I think Adam has a write-up in the FontLab forum on how to move data between the applications. I took an introductory type design class a couple years ago, and I noticed that many people seemed to like working in Illustrator.</div>
