body: "I am a graphic design student currently working on airplane cockpit displays.
  I wanted help with choosing a font that would work well in a cockpit environment.
  I was wondering if anyone here has information about efforts made in designing fonts
  optimized for cockpit displays. \r\nThe closest thing I could find was - The Design
  of an Optimum Alphanumeric Symbol Set for Cockpit Displays by the Air Force Institute
  of Technology, Ohio School of Engineering. While I came to know of its existence
  through the internet I could not get hold of the document to see what\u2019s in
  it.\r\n\r\nAny information would be helpful. Thank you!\r\n\r\nVinu Chaitanya\r\nNational

  body: "most typeaces are designed with sharp corners, which is not very suitable
    for screens, because screens have smaller resoulution then printed stuff. and
    they use light, which is the opposite to ink. thus, slightly rounded typefaces
    might be a good solution, if sharp corners don't look good on the cockpit screens.\r\n\r\nhowever,
    there are typefaces designed for screen use even if they have no rounded corners.\r\n\r\nff
    unit might be a good starting point:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_rounded/\r\n"
