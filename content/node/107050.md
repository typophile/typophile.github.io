  body: "Hi Fivos, good find, but your link to Microsoft Parchment is broken. This
    works:\r\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1013\r\nThe
    lowercase in the image appears in several different fonts, including Parchment.
    The uppercase in Parchment differs from the image:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ParchmentInUse_3496.jpg]\r\nDon"

    uppercase in Parchment differs from the image</blockquote>\r\nI think it's not
    so different, it could actually be an exact match. \r\nThe text in the original
    image is \"Persichitti\" and not \"Bersichitti\" as you set in your example, although
    I can see a small difference in lowercase /h tail."

  body: "Another font with the same lower case but different upper case, Celebration
    Text Fancy, digitized by Dan X. solo and sold with a Dover Alphabet Book in 1999:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CelebrationTextDXSolo1998_5965.jpg]\r\nI
    suspect that the image is from yet another digitization of an old font. Might
    be worth checking the old fonts released by Image Club Graphics, House of Lime
    etc. Then again, I don't know how old the image is or where it appeared. Perhaps
    it's something from the photo-lettering era that is not be digitized? Italian
    foundry?\r\nDon "
