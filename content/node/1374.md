    ravings on the Swatika have turned me off a lot of his more lucid studies on graphic

    I can see why you like Heller. He&#39;s all for &#39;forgetting&#39; things he
    doesn&#39;t want to see or hear too. <BR> <BR><b>Hrant said:</b> <BR> <BR>...<i>

    three hundred years back. Unfortunately modern typographers have not learned from
