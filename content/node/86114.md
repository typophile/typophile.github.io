    a bit reluctant to spell this out further since this issue has now come up in
    several threads despite the fact that the crucial difference between the old and
    new AFDKO is described in detail at the FLS Beta download page in the section
    labelled \"Please read the posts below carefully for important information about
    new features, fixed bugs and known issues\", and I don't think Adam or anyone
    else should be required to continually answer the same question, especially when
    they had already answered it before it was asked.\r\n\r\nThe script Adam provides
    is just a convenience -- it's not needed to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "In terms of 'just working without problems' you are likely to run into the
    same problem in any font tool that made the transition from AFDKO code 1.0 to
    the more recent version, because Adobe made necessary changes in that code to
    make new functionality work. This means that older feature code needs to be fixed
    up to work with the new AFDKO, and this will be true in other tools, not just
    FontLab.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't excuse the FontLab support folk for apparently failing
    to process your forum approval, or otherwise providing you with some kind of response.
    But making fonts is a fairly complicated technical process, and being willing
    to read release notes and understand changes in software is a pretty standard
    expectation in professional manufacturing tools."

    My Friends\" Erik, Adam, and Frederik, I have finally succeeded in getting Python,
    RoboFab, and FontLab 5.1 running merrily hand-in-hand with OSX Lion 107.2 and
    executing Python scripts!  Did I say a LITTLE help? That should read \"Great Gobs
    of Gargantuan Help!\" \r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/python-scripting/instructions-installing-robofab-12-rev-226-in-fls-51-on-mac-os-x-1072-t8300.0.html\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/robofab/browse_frm/thread/9b587051ca7a9554/386b482a829738bb#386b482a829738bb\r\n\r\nInstructions
    from Adam Twardoch:\r\n\r\n\"1. Quit FontLab Studio.\r\n\r\n2. Download:\r\nhttp://robofab.org/download/current/RoboFab226M_plusDependencies.zip\r\n\r\n2.
    In Finder, navigate to the location where you downloaded the .zip\r\nfile, double-click
    to unzip it (if it already hadn't happened). You\r\nshould see a folder named
    \"RoboFab226M_plusDependencies\".\r\n\r\n3. Open the Terminal app\r\n\r\n4. In
    Terminal, type \"cd \" (with a trailing space) but don't hit Enter.\r\nDrag the
    RoboFab226M_plusDependencies folder to the Terminal window. You\r\nshould see
    something like this in the Terminal window:\r\n\r\ncd /users/[your username]/Downloads/RoboFab226M_plusDependencies\r\n\r\n5.
    In Terminal, hit Enter.\r\n\r\n6. In Terminal, do the following:\r\n(Hit Enter
    after each line. After the first \"sudo\" you'll need to enter\r\nyour administrator
    password.)\r\n\r\ncd FontTools\r\nsudo /usr/bin/python setup.py install\r\ncd
    ..\r\ncd RoboFab\r\nsudo /usr/bin/python setup.py install\r\ncd ..\r\ncd DialogKit\r\nsudo
    mv Lib/dialogKit/ /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/\r\n\r\n7. In Finder, do File
    / New Finder Window\r\n\r\n8. If you have enabled \"Use custom locations for user
    data folders\" in\r\nFontLab Studio / Preferences / General Options / Folders
    and paths,\r\nnavigate Finder to folder that you've set as the \"FontLab Studio
    user\r\ndata files\" folder, and skip to step 11.\r\n\r\n9. If you have not customized
    the location, then in Finder's menu,\r\nchoose Go / Go to Folder...\r\n\r\n10.
    In the text box that appears, enter:\r\n~/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio
    5/Macros\r\nand click on Go.\r\n\r\n11. Your Finder should now should show a Macro
    folder with at least\r\nthree subfolders in it (Effects, Export and System).\r\n\r\n12.
    Switch to the Finder window that has the\r\nRoboFab226M_plusDependencies folder,
    and open the subfolder\r\nRoboFab/Scripts folder that is inside.\r\n\r\n13. You
    should see a folder with several subfolders: \"Contributed\",\r\n\"RoboFabIntro\",
    \"RoboFabUFO\", \"RoboFabUFO2\", \"RoboFabUtils\".\r\n\r\n14. Select those folders
    and drag them to the Macro folder in the other\r\nFinder window.\r\n\r\n15. Open
    FontLab Studio and in the Edit Macro panel type in:\r\n\r\nimport robofab\r\nimport
    dialogKit\r\n\r\nIf you don't see anything in the Output panel, you have installed\r\nRoboFab
    and its FontLab macros and DialogKit successfully.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\"\r\n"
