body: 'I have a problem.. I have done a font for a company and it doesn&#39;t work
  in InDesign..  <BR>Here&#39;s what he&#39;s saying:  <BR> <BR>&#34;The font problems
  seem mostly to be occurring when printing from  <BR>Adobe InDesign. They are post
  script errors which cause the documents  <BR>not to print at all from our rip. To
  get a printable result we are  <BR>forced to create a pdf from the document and
  then print from that. We  <BR>suspect that there may be loose ends and/or open paths
  in some of the  <BR>characters&#34; <BR> <BR>So now I wonder what shall I do to
  make it work? <BR>I have made the font in Default Encoding &#40;and also tried Adobe
  Encoding&#41;, Kerning &amp; Metrics. TTF <BR>'

    does FontLab give a warning or error message?

  body: Does the font print okay from other applications? Which ones have they tried?
    <BR> <BR>When a PDF is made, does it affect printability whether the entire font
    is embedded, versus subsetting for only the used glyphs? <BR> <BR>T
