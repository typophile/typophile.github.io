  description says \"ne0-grotesque\" but to me it feels a lot like Frutiger of Myriad,
  except for a few characters like the 'y.'   A few of the terminals are almost vertical,
  but most end at a bit of an angle, especially in the heavier weights.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp_3548.jpg]"
