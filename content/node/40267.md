  like the letters which\r\nmake them up: ch, ph, sh, th, wh, qu, kn, gn, wr, gh\r\nand
  at least one trigram: sch\r\n(I'm not including things like \"st\", a consonantal
  combination which is\r\ncommon but where the distinct sounds of the letter are evident)\r\n\r\nI
  treat these as single phonemes. I presume these happen in other\r\nlanguages. \"qu\"
  is common throughout Romance languages. French also has\r\n\"ch\". Spanish (and
  Welsh) have \"ll\".\r\n\r\nCan anyone provide me with more combinations?\""

    number of English loan words like "pizza".

  body: "The relations between written letters and pronounced sounds are much more
    complicated.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples for \"th\":\r\n\r\n1. \"th\" in \"Thai\",
    \"Thames\", etc.\r\n2. \"th\" in \"thank\", \"thatch\", etc.\r\n3. \"th\" in \"than\",
    \"that\", etc.\r\n4. \"th in \"cathouse\" etc.\r\n\r\nAll four \"th\" are different
    phonetically. It is strange, but there are English native speakers, who think
    that \"th\" in \"that\" and \"th\" in \"thank\" represent the same sound."
