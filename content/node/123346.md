  the effect looks fancy, I would like some suggestions how to make the lettering
  part more \"streamlined\". \r\n\r\nIt was modelled with blender, with a simple screw
  command, which, can work with continuous lines. \r\nHow would you connect letters
  with horizontal segments? \r\n\r\nI wouldn't prefer adding loops personally, so
  a regular script writing is a no-go. "

  body: The S and T seem to hold to a different rule than the rest of the letters,
    since they seem fully outlined. Other that that this looks really cool, even if
    I'm not sure what it's for!
