  body: 'Closest I''ve found is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/|RR
    Block Gothic]] (may be enough close to consider it as a match?). 2 similars, some
    letter designs remain off though: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/monopol/|Monopol]]
    (R''s leg is not spury as your sample), (obvious) [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]
    (K and S totally off), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed/|Heroic
    Condensed]] (R and S off), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/solano-gothic-mvb/|Solano
    Gothic]] (R and K really off, J and S far from matching too)'
