    formatted for a wide variety of resolutions and monitor set-ups. I grabbed the
    "wheatg" left image for my 1400x1050 notebook; wonderful rich greens. Beautiful
    stuff. Now if only I could figure out how to set 2 different images on my 2 monitors
    (run off my notebook).

    The fading image rotation feature in OSX is so cool that I took and made subtle
    changes in the background color so that ever minute or so the hue would change,
    but the logo stayed there. \r\n\r\nThere are 43 variations there, I would be willing
    to upload them somewhere, if anyone was interested. It wasn't my original design,
    so I guess that is up to the Typophile guys or whoever made that background first.
