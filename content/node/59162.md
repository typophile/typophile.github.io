  body: I think Christopher wants to map that list to typophile membership, or maybe
    include typophile members non-typographic blogs and sites - so my blog www.obscureghostbustersrealtedjokesandlimericks.com
    would count too?

    and the majority of its content is about <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/FontSpotting.html\">Font
    Identification</a>. Since 2000 I have developed, with a lot of help from many
    typophiles (with and without capital T), five Font Identification Guides:\r\n\r\nthe
    <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\">Script Font ID
    Guide</a>, which is probably used the most on my site, with its <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html\">Script
    Font Reference List</a>; \r\n\r\nthe <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html\">Bauhaus-style
    Font ID Guide</a>, my first ID Guide; \r\n\r\nthe <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html\">Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide</a>, which was the first Guide to use my Key letter identification
    method, and which is in the process of being replaced by the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php\">new
    interactive version</a>; \r\n\r\nthe <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html\">Lined
    Fonts ID Guide</a>, for multiline and inline styles; \r\n\r\nand my personal favorite,
    and most complete Guide, the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a>, which allows the use of the attributes of just 12 letters (a,
    b, e, g, y, E, J, K, M, R, U and W) to identify over 1,800 serif type families,
    including many pre-digital typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe Bowfin Printworks home page talks
    about custom spice labels and other graphic services, but these are how I pay
    for the web site, along with some donations from people who get personal font
    ID help from me via e-mail.\r\n\r\nThe site also includes the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BowfinPond.html\">Bowfin
    Pond</a>, where I have collected most of my poetry and other writing.\r\n\r\n-
