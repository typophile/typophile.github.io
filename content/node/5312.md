body: Hello All - <BR> <BR>My wife is having me design the invitation for her  sisters
  bachelorette party.  They want it to be classy and fun.  They are all real girly
  girls and my wife loves the shoe concept that I came up with for the card.  I am
  wondering what advice you can give me for a good companion to Brothers Regular.  I
  have the rest of the card done in Brothers Reg also, I think it is too much - -
  and hard to read at smaller sizes.  Whadayathink? <BR> <BR>thanks

    thought I would show it for reference to what would be  set in  whatever font
    might work. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/38922.gif"

  body: Did i post this in the wrong area? Maybe  its just a slow day on typophile.  LEt
    me rephrase my question, I need to find a good typeface to pair with Brothers
    Regular, I have no idea where to start...I think that brothers might work for
    the saying at the top of the second page...but the details need to be set in another
    type... <BR> <BR>SUGGEST AWAY!! <BR> <BR>tia <BR> <BR>shawn

  body: Brothers is a great typeface, but I&#39;d be hard pressed to call it  <BR>fabulous
    in the same sense you&#39;re using it here... <BR> <BR>You could solve the problem
    by changing the color of the back.  <BR>Knocking out Brothers out of black will
    work okay, but you could  <BR>get better impact with a flood of pink on the back.

    it is with the color change - not so sure about it yet...any ideas on a font that
    would work well with brothers?  I am thinking a sans serif - - I will try a few
    and post again. <BR> <BR>shawn

  body: Hello Shawn <BR> <BR>really nice idea! <BR> <BR>I like the simplicity of the
    card and i think Brothers are the right choice. <BR> <BR>Anyway if you need a
    font to make contrary to Brothers and make a connection to &#34;fabulous&#34;
    i would recommend Stuyvesant and a more round and shophisticated design to the
    shoe. So you will have two levels. The retro simple lettering of the accompaning
    text and the &#34;fabulous&#34; lettering of the key words &#40;shoes, Fabulous,
    Megan Dunning&#41;. <BR> <BR>I tried something to show the contrast of the fonts
    and my recommendation for the colour, but i will send my proposal only if you
    ask me to, because maybe you don&#39;t want to get disturbed by &#34;other&#39;s
    designs&#34; and also because the last time i did it there was a negative reaction.
    So tell me. <BR> <BR>Nice idea, anyway. Have a nice day too. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Christos - <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestions!  And by all means show your
    idea, I won&#39;t be offended in the least bit.   <BR> <BR>I googled for stuyvesant
    and found <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/stuyvesant/#stylelist">this</a>
    <BR> <BR>I am looking mostly for a san-serif to pair with brothers, but I am excited
    to see what you did with Stuyvesant &#40;what a name!&#41; <BR> <BR>thanks <BR>

  body: Hi Shawn, <BR> <BR>Great concept . . . Right away I am wanting to know what
    I need to buy new shoes for! &#40;all women love shoes, don&#39;t they?!&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Is this a postcard or a folded invite? <BR> <BR>I think the first color
    scheme works best . . . you could try leaving the cover the full black bleed and
    on the inside &#40;or back&#41; have the &#34;flood of pink&#34; as Joseph suggested.
    This color of pink to me, however, reminds me more of a baby announcement rather
    than a bachelorette party . . . <BR> <BR>I like the contrast of Stuyvesant with
    Brothers -- I don&#39;t think the layout works as well anymore; with this new
    font you may need to  experiment with some different ways to present the type.
    <BR> <BR>I am still leaning towards the first cover design you presented, I love
    the bold stamplike quality of it,  it really makes a statement compared to the
    other designs. Perhaps you could try some sort of decorative swoop or accent on
    the shoe that would tie in the new Stuyvesant font used on the inside? I don&#39;t
    know if that would work, but it might sparks some ideas for you. <BR> <BR>Props
    on the idea, Shawn, your concept definitely states &#34;classy and fun.&#34;

  body: Hey Sally thanks for the comments -  <BR> <BR>&#34;Is this a postcard or a
    folded invite?&#34; <BR> <BR>It is going to be a front and back post card, kinkos
    style...&#40;my soul cringes when I walk in that place, THE MUSIC!!! they play
    the worst gag me with a stick love ballads of all time&#41; <BR> <BR>While I like
    the contrast of Brothers and Stuyvesant, I think I am going to keep Brothers as
    the lone decorative type.  Here I tried pairing Brothers with Gill Sans on the
    back of the card. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39078.gif"
    alt=";;;;;"> <BR>Any thoughts? <BR> <BR>Shawn

  body: Hi Shawn - <BR> <BR>There might not be enough contrast between Gill Sans and
    Brothers. Have you tried experimenting with some new ways to layout the type?
    For me, the spacing and typesetting here is awkward -- the mixing of center and
    right alignment as you have it here doesn&#39;t seem to be working . . . <BR>
    <BR>Here is an example of a composition that might give you some new ideas . .

    agree with what you are saying about it feeling akward - I need to get some sleep
    and look at this with fresh eyes &#40;and brain&#41; tommorow! <BR> <BR>s.
