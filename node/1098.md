  chance on the market to make pixel fonts and super pixelfonts on a easy way. <BR>
  <BR>Here in the typophile forums, many people are asking about how to make pixel
  fons optimized for flash, there are may ways to make them and the same now for pixel
  fonts with greys like super pixel fonts.  <BR> <BR>So if any one have any coments
  about this app, or questions about it, please post it here. <BR> <BR>mh.

  body: I was a beta-tester for BitFonter. The two pre-release versions I had both
    seemed very nice - just some bugs typical of beta SW. Unfortunately, I was trying
    to do something tricky with Windows grayscale fonts, and the beta versions could
    never do it right. The MacOS fonts I generated worked great though. This past
    September I asked Yuri if the release version fixed that bug, and he said yes
    - I just can&#39;t afford to buy it right now. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR>Most of all use Fontographer, If Yuri or people behind Bitfonter can asume
    that the market of designers who buy pixelfonts is not small, a next version of
    this app have to include an automatic optimization from pixels to vectors. A rusian
    App called Pixfont are trying to make it, closely but with bugs. <BR> <BR>A lot
    of people will buy this app if becomes as   <BR>easy as paint pixels and generate
    postcript fonts. <BR> <BR>mh.

  body: I&#39;ve got BitFonter and have been using it not to create fonts  <BR>directly,
    but as a design aid for creating outline versions of  <BR>my old bitmap fonts.
    I work out the design and spacing <BR>in BitFonter until everything looks right.
    Then I export it as  <BR>a Mac bitmap fonts and import into Fontographer in the  <BR>template
    layer and manually trace the glyph shapes. It&#39;s  <BR>rather tedious, even
    with all the shortcuts and tricks I&#39;ve  <BR>developed, so I&#39;m interested
    in some of these recent efforts  <BR>to automate the process. It seems like an
    obvious next step. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve taken a look at Pixfont, but I&#39;m not
    too impressed. It  <BR>seems to throw out the sidebearings of the existing bitmap  <BR>font
    and replace them with one pixel on each side. It also  <BR>only exports in one
    size &#40;8 point, I think&#41;, no matter what  <BR>size the source bitmap font
    is. You can fix this in FontLab  <BR>or Fontographer, but it&#39;s a bit odd.
    It uses an unusual  <BR>method for overcoming the Flash filled-in counter problem.  <BR>Basically,
    instead of using compound paths, it uses a single  <BR>path which cuts into the
    counter and back out again. This  <BR>seems to work okay for Flash, but it would
    create a visible  <BR>line in letters with counters if you used it for print work
    or  <BR>used the font very large. It also has a unique feature that  <BR>lets
    you edit the font in Photoshop &#40;or whatever&#41; but it&#39;s  <BR>pretty
    basic and would be a tedious way to do this type of  <BR>font.

    <BR> <BR> <BR>FlashFonter <BR> <BR>As Flash websites have proliferated some typographers
    have taken to creating special pixel-based TrueType fonts which render cleanly
    and sharply at low resolution on such sites. Craig Kroeger, of miniml.com, gave
    a demonstration of this technique at TypeCon 2003. Such fonts act like bitmap
    fonts in that they are not anti-aliased and turn on specific pixels in a grid
    when displayed at the size for which they were designed. '

    need an app as easy to draw, kern, test and generate. <BR> <BR>There are other

    <BR> <BR>look at the example down on the left in the homepage, they call it fx

    First, PostScript: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/15855.gif"

    alt="pftt"> <BR> <BR>Notice that the character encoding is all messed up in the
    PostScript font. I&#39;m showing pixel fonts here, but this is true of any font,
    not just pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>With Dynamic or Input text, in both cases certain
    characters do not display at all, but the same scrambled effect happens with PostScript
    fonts. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just wondering if there&#39;s some advantage to PostScript
    for Flash fonts that I&#39;m not aware of. It really seems like TrueType is the

    export format is preferred - it is more predictable and works better in Flash

    paragraph, without generate the font, installed in the sistem, open in flash or
    photoshop...  <BR> <BR>No. It is not possible to do that without installing font.
    And if it is installed, it is better to test it in Flash or Photoshop. There is
    a preview panel that will show how font will work in different font sizes, but
    it is not rendered by the OS, so we cannot garantee that it will work the same
    way in applications. <BR> <BR>Please note, that FlashFonter &#40;or PixlFonter

    font thing is a bug in Flash. It mostly seems to affect embedded fonts. If you
    use &#34;device&#34; fonts, the encoding problem is reduced &#40;but not eliminated&#41;,
    but using device fonts for static text introduces other worse problems, especially
    for pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>Kind of off-topic, but: The other Flash font problem
    I&#39;m having is that &#34;auto kern&#34; seems to have no effect in FlashMX.
    I&#39;ve been unable to find any information about this problem on the web. I&#39;ve
    tried posting about this on Macromedia&#39;s Flash newsgroup, but no relevant
    response so far. Works correctly in Flash 5, but I can&#39;t get it to have any
    effect in FlashMX on three different Macs running either OS X or 9. Can any other
    Flash users confirm or deny this?'
