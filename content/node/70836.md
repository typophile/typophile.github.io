  to L.A. after years of working in NYC at a corporate id + communications firm in
  Soho.\r\n\r\nThat being said, admittedly,  it's a whole different ball game out
  here, and I am having trouble finding many firms that seem to elevate type and design
  through their work. Granted, I know they are here... but I thought I may inquire
  among the typophiles for any firms of note - hiring or not, that I should keep an
  eye out for?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nb"
