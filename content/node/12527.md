body: "hi,\r\n\r\ni have a project coming up (freelance) that i'm going to have to
  design 6 postcards for. they are strictly 'reminder' cards and they will be mailed
  to existing clients and maybe a small amount of prospective clients.\r\n\r\nthe
  company works in creative talent recruitment. they've been around for a while and
  want to remind everyone.\r\n\r\nthe emphasis on the 6 postcards is visual. the message
  is taking more of a backseat for something visually catchy and the entire project
  is open-ended on which way those visuals can go. lots of room/time for exploration.\r\n\r\ni've
  not dealt with a project like this that was so open-ended and geared toward me doing
  whatever it is i want to do and just generally playing around for a good touch of
  the time.\r\n\r\nmy question to some veteran freelancers/designers is how much should
  i be charging for this project? my initial thoughts were between 5-700 for each
  card. they will only be mailed once to each client and this is really free advertising
  for myself as i will get credit for the design and art once they are mailed to design
  firms and agencies. i'm also playing and experimenting. it seems more like fun than
  actual freelance work..\r\n\r\nthanks all\r\n\r\nw|m\r\n"
