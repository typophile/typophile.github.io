body: "Hi there, I've encountered a lil problem with rebuilding a grid from the book
  \"Grid systems in graphic design\" by Josef Mueller-Brockmann. As show in the crop
  from the book \"Grid systems in graphic design\" (mueller_brockmann_1.gif), Brockmann
  took a 10pt font with 3pt lead and managed to align every fifth line descender heigth
  and every first line cap height with the \"emptyline\" (the sixth line between the
  thicker black strokes). I tried that myself in ID and I'm now facing the problem
  that the empty line (16pt in total) just fits at a rate of 95%. If you have a look
  at the mueller-brokmann_2.pdf, everything looks fine at 100% zoom but at 300% things
  starting to get messy. \r\n\r\nAny idea if that is normal?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTim"

    things are off at the top of the document but get closer to being aligned at the
    bottom. I''d double check that position of your guidelines and leading, set them
    using the same units (if you''re defining linespace with points, define your guideline
    positions in points too.) '

  body: "Perhaps it is a case of the digital point vs the original point from lead
    type. The book was written using Mueller-Brockmann's career long metal type experience
    but the size of the point/pica has been adjusted a very small amount to make 6
    picas equal exactly one inch (which it does not using the original point/pica).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "There have been threads about this in the past, it\u2019s usually something
    to do with differences in the size of points or someone forgetting to turn off
    baseline grids. I believe that there are some great resources at http://www.thegridsystem.org/
    for working this stuff out. But generally I find it easier to use hierarchical
    grids with six columns and a couple of hanglines instead of trying to work out
    modular systems."

  body: "You can work it out if you feel compelled to. Just set your baseline grid
    and at grid intervals, make a guide at either cap height or x-height above it
    as you see fit.  This sort of thing was more important in lead type because you
    had to make the lead slugs even out but digitally, the value is limited. Try it
    as an exercise but as a working pattern, it is almost pointless since you can
    make subheads stap to baseline grid.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    and will have some quality time with their grid calculator demo. \r\n\r\nI'll
    let you guys know how it worked out.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nTim\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Tim\r\n\r\nI have exactly the same problem. I'm new to grids and am trying
    to reproduce the 32 field grid on page 88. I've set my type at 9pt and the leading
    at 11pt but it just won't align within the grid fields in the same way as shown
    on page 89. If anyone out there has managed to reproduce this grid in InDesign,
    I'd love to get my hands on a template. \r\n\r\nI hope someone can help!\r\n\r\nThanks"
