  body: Hand lettering is sometimes based on existing fonts, but not usually. It seems
    more likely in this case that it was based on or inspired by some old hand lettering.

  body: That is gorgeous. You just might find something, sort of close, at Letterhead
    Fonts. And when I say sort of, I mean vaguely.
