  for a little bit of feedback of anything that's obviously horrendous.\r\nI've only
  gone over the spacing very quickly to make it look presentable, so don't think that
  it's my best attempt!\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, anything in particular that is making you
  feel a bit ill here?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nBen."

    a bad novel with the same plot as a bestseller...\r\n\r\nAnd it really is coincidence,
    by the way... "
