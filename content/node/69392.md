  some time. You can see the 3D letter forms in two different isometric planes, front,
  and side. It looks great with different colors and background effects. There are
  a few questionable letters and I would love to hear some feedback.\r\n\r\nWhat do
  you all think?\r\n\r\n"

    flipped Z for the S and a diagonal treatment like the X for the Z."
