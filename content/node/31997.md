  for a display of work done by some students in a workshop called 'playing with light'.
  I would especially like to get some views on the font used...if it works for the
  poster or not and also about the overall look of the poster. Please spare a couple
  of minutes of your time to tell me what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/playing

  body: "nice image...........\r\n\r\ni wouldnt run your type into the darker parts
    like you have done with the last few names on that list. Im not sold on the placement
    of 'playing with light' ....for me top left would work better with the image,
    because the image pulls the eye from left to right, so i would put the main title
    at the beginning of that line of path, which would probably have a knock on effect
    onto your other text. But at the moment i just feel it lacks a hierarchy. But
    i like the overall feel, just think it needs some 'playing with layout' ho ho"

    typeface for the "Playing with light" and make it more part of the image?

    with light part. I don''t like the really small pm. its looking amazing though,
    loving the image. '

    with the others- you need to use another more organic typeface for the title.\r\n\r\nMikey

  body: "It seems that the presentation is over already anyway, if the date given
    in the poster is correct\u2026\r\nApart from that, I like it as it is. The names
    list seems a little too long for the picture, though. And I am wondering if the
    only names you chose white for are referring to some special people (I mean this
    white is the only instance that is brighter than all the rest of your poster,
    which says 'something with light').\r\nNice work with the 3 UC 'F' in <strong>F</strong>riday,
    <strong>F</strong>ebruary, <strong>F</strong>ountain, btw. The 'organic' feel
    of the arc you are playing with seems reasonable in connection with these. But
    then again, why have the names list as straight as it is, left aligned? What about
    putting it to the upper left? Nah, it strangely fits, anyway, so just forget it
    ;-) "

  body: "I like the atmosphere it has. But I agree with some of the comments above.\r\nI
    also think that the overall size of the type may be a bit small. Usually, a poster
    should catch peoples eye from a small to medium distance. With this poster you
    really would have to get up close, which in itself is fine. But the poster will
    have to get peoples attention first, for that to happen. :)"

  body: "I'd darken the color of the title to make it stand out more, it gets lost
    down there in the corner. That might not make it work, but its a start. That said,
    I agrees with the previous comments about alignments and scale.\r\n\r\nI think
    that there's a much bigger flaw in your concept for the piece; neither of your
    typefaces integrate with the decorative elements they're attached to. The way
    you've just extended straight portions of strokes and serifs and attached the
    decorations makes them look like they were tacked on without much thought; you
    really need to either find fonts that can make the connection smoothly or really
    start tweaking the outlines to make them work smoothly with the fonts you're using
    now. "

  body: "Thank you so much for all the feedback...will put up a updated version of
    the poster soon. I would also like to explain a few things which I missed out
    in the last post. I have mentioned the names of the facutly members who conducted
    the workshop in white and the names of the students with brown. The image is that
    of a sliced grape projected on to a wall using an old slide projector. If anyone
    is interested in knowing more about how we produced the image I would be glad
    to explain in a little more detail. Thank you once again for all your views.\r\n\r\nVinu"
