  the Adobe programs.\r\n\r\nWhen I select 'Futura Round Light' from the menu, it
  gives me 'Futura Round Condensed Light'.  Same thing when I select 'Medium'.  'Consensed
  Bold' isn't available on my menu at all, even though it is installed.\r\n\r\nConsequently,
  I can't use 'Light' or 'Medium' in my design because the menu gives me their Consensed
  versions instead.\r\n\r\nIn my FONTS folder (Windows 7), the Condensed and Regular
  versions of Light/Medium/Bold have the same file names.  That shouldn't make much
  of a difference as the important file info is embedded, but this is the only clue
  I have as to why it is confusing Adobe.\r\n\r\nI have already cleared the font caches.
  \ It does the same thing in Adobe CC and CS5.  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nScreenshot
