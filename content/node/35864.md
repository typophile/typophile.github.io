body: "Hello everyone! I just downloaded some custom DVD covers for Buffy the Vampire
  Slayer, and I realized that I need to make another one to hold some of the bonus
  discs I have. I want to make it uniform with the other seven I have downloaded,
  though, so I need to use the same font. The problem is, I don't know what font it
  is! I thought it was Morpheus at first but there are quite a few differences from
  this font to that one (different J's, different M's, etc.) so I decided to come
  to you guys, the experts, for help.\r\n\r\nI took a screenshot of the font and you
  can find it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v65/aero_ziggy/?action=view&current=BuffyFontHelp.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Thanks, I thought it was Mason Sans Serif font so I was going in the right
    direction. Not that I am opposed to buying the font or anything, but is this a
    font that can be downloaded for free somewhere or not? I ask because I've purchased
    a font before only to find out it was available freely elsewhere . . .

  body: "Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Honestly, I only need to type two sentences
    with it so I don't know if it's necessarily worth it, but I can always just use
    a different font. I just wanted to try and use the same font.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the help!"

  body: "EDIT: This post should be the one before last, not the last. My typo-editing
    shoved it to the end of the thread, sorry. \r\n\r\nTo be honest: Everything digital
    can be copied and spread all over the internet. So every font, too, of course.
    But if you find a commercial font fro free download somewhere means someone has
    stolen it. It's like finding a wallet in the streets with the address in it. Of
    course you could keep it, and spend the money. But that means you become a thieve,
    too. \r\n\r\nThe better solution is to purchase the font, sleep well at night
    and be sure to have supported at least one of the typedesigners guild. Only with
    this behaviour one can be sure that tomorrow will be some new typefaces. \r\n"
