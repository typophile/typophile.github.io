body: "On the following page the phrase \"Coffee of Character\" is set. It looks like
  Gill Sans, but most stems end with a diagonal line, also the bottom of some characters
  go over the baseline:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whittard.co.uk/coffee\r\n\r\nThere are more
  uses here:\r\nhttp://www.whittard.co.uk/\r\n\r\nThe closest I got was London by
  A2 TYPE:\r\nhttp://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/london_regular.html, but the capitals
  on this typeface end on the line...\r\n\r\nI've also found Bliss, which is again
  similar, but not the one...\r\nhttp://www.type.co.uk/a_to_z/id/19955\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nChristian"

  body: "Gill is definitely the starting point. But somebody then put angles on some
    terminals, but went a bit too far. It has a certain amateurishness about it -
    the M terminals - why? and the R and U look pretty ropey.\r\n\r\nSome design company
    probably persuaded Whittards that butchering Gill made it more 'ownable', they
    probably think they've got something special."

  body: There are some other Gill Sans/Johnston-esque types out there, but this doesn't
    match any of those either (that I'm familiar with). This could very well be a
    custom job.

  body: "It's also on the packaging. I suppose the commissioning of an individual
    typeface would make sense...\r\nIt's to settle an discussion in the studio, rather
    than identification for use."

  body: This isn't the commissioning of an individual typeface, it's simply an alteration
    of Gill. Don't get the two mixed up.
