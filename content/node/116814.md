  body: Don't know this one and doubt actually it could be a font as it. I call this
    kind of style 'Tuscan'. Sometimes they are also listed as 'Circus' or 'Western'
    (style) fonts. If I have to reproduce it, I'd probably start from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/wood-type|URW++
    Wood Type]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/quadrille-2|Quadrille]] or
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saloon-girl|Saloon Girl]] mainly redrawing
    /A and editing /E.
