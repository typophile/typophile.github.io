body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lpd_tph_4_6221.jpg]\r\n.\r\nLadies and
  gentlemen,\r\n\r\nI take the pleasure to finally announce the release of <strong>Lapidaria</strong>.
  A warm Thankyou to those of you fellow typophiles who helped me with advice during
  the last weeks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lpd_tph_1_6257.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lpd_tph_2_5644.jpg]\r\nIt
  is a family of nine fonts: three versions (maior, medior, minor \u2013 which is
  upper-, middle- and lowercase) in three weights each. I thought it might be somewhat
  nice to try a kind of uncial script in a non-historic manner, even as a sans. Hope
  you like it.\r\nThe triple allows to do typography like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lpd_tph_3_5317.jpg]\r\nThe
  fonts are completely equipped for any Euro-Latin language (yes, even Maltese and
  Welsh ;-). Note that they also contain Greek.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lpd_tph_5_4100.jpg]\r\nThe
  fonts are available seperately and in varios packs. For instance, there are sets
  which bundle all Regular fonts or others which bundle all Minor or Medior fonts.\r\nBest
  of all: one font is <strong>free!</strong>\r\n \r\nNow you\u2019re welcome on the
  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/|Myfonts-Lapidaria site]]
  where specimen in Deutsch and English are waiting for you.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lpd_tph_7_4849.jpg]\r\nFor
  those who\u2019d like to look a bit in the faces\u2019 background I\u2019ve written
  something [[http://typophile.com/node/71253|there]].\r\n"
