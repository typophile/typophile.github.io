body: "Hi. Any clue the best way to exchange files with a PC?\r\n\r\nI have a problem.
  I am the only Mac based system in the company. I am overworked and I need to hand
  off some production work. Most of my packaging is done in illustrator. I am having
  trouble with fonts. I have used the font converter \"Transtype Pro\" so that I can
  share files with the PC based assistant. This has had mixed results, some fonts
  don't show up in the menu. I had her try the \"Suitcase\" for windows demo but it
  crashes her computer. She isn't savvy about fonts or trouble shooting and IT would
  be mad that I even installed unauthorized software on her computer. How can I get
  these fonts to work cross platform?"

    that's sadly true. Some foundries are still getting up-to-speed."
