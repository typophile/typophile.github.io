What you guys think of it?

<div class=commentbody>I'll comment. Sorry you feel ignored. This reminds me of something. Did you design a non-stencil version?
g -- love it
k & K -- too wide, curve of leg feels out of place
w -- looks squashed, probably because of middle vertical stroke
z -- too wide
s -- maybe too wide
V -- somehow out of place, can't figure out why
W -- seems out of place or off somehow
t -- too many cuts too close to each other
f -- same

<div class=commentbody>I'll add myself onto Tiffany's comments, except that I have one more suggestion about the f. It looks like a r (I know, a different form than your r) with another stroke on top of it, instead of feeling more f-like.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wish I'd get more comments on my font projects too. I have some stuff going on in serif and experimental that hasn't gained much attention.
What you have here is more of a broken-stroke design than a true stencil. That's fine as a decorative element in a digital font, but stencils are designed with something else in mind. If it's just the decorative impression of a stencil you're going for, this is great, but for a functional stencil you'll need to engineer it a bit more carefully.
The crossbars on a stencil (that appear as gaps in the letter forms) are structural members of the stencil board. there to suport the parts of the board that would tend to go floppy and break off dure to their narrow attachments or fall out completely from being fully detached otherwise. Graphic appearance is a consideration, but a secondary one.
Your "K" and "L" are good examples of this principle in action, while the V cut of the "M" looks likely to break or erode with repeated use.
Those curved cuts in some of your letters are very interesting, but would be unlikely to be used for a stencil other than a die-cut paper one not more than a few inches high.
Picture, if you will, each of those letter forms cut out from a 6 foot square steel sheet. Think of how you would most simply weld bars across the open letter spaces to hold all the pieces together through repeated handling.

<div class=commentbody>I like this. The diagonal stroke of z is too thin. V/v looks out of place because the break is down the center, which has been deliberately avoided in all the other letterforms. 3 seems like it could use another break, perhaps across the lower right.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the great feedback. I'll try to adjust the design according to your suggestion and soon I'll be posting it again.
