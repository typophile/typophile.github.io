  It's used throughout http://loveshackfancy.com (although they appear to use a variety
  of fonts, the only ones I can identify are Callie Hand and Ginette). These images
  might not all be the same font either (where it says \"Halter Mini Dress\" it appears
  to be different for the first two words... whereas the word DRESS exactly matches
  the images above it).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/collection_banner_dresses_4001.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/collection_banner_bottoms_4230.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p_fancy-dress-4_5128.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p_love-halter-dress-2_4482.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p_halter-mini-dress-5_4054.png]\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help me? Hoping it's actually a font..."
