body: "Hello everyone, I've been lurking on this website for some time and found it
  very useful. Now I have a question that I can't find a satisfying answer to anywhere,
  so I decided to finally join.\r\n\r\nI'm familiar with the many ways you can adjust
  the justification of the text, but if one decides to go with the ragged-right block,
  it seems to me that you really have no choice but to accept whatever Adobe decides
  to be the most acceptable edge.\r\n\r\nAs Bringhurst puts it: \"When setting ragged
  text with a computer, take a moment to refine your software's understanding of what
  constitutes an honest rag.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I would like to do just that. Ideally,
  I would like to be able to set the minimum and maximum line length, and tell InDesign
  what sacrifices to make to achieve this. Or maybe just be able to introduce a certain
  degree of flexibility of spacing, to even out the rag.\r\n\r\nSo far, having spent
  a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how to do this, my conclusion
  is that InDesign will simply not let you. So my question to you is:\r\n\r\nAm I
  right in my conclusion? If so, is there maybe a plug-in that would allow for this
  functionality? And perhaps most importantly, how do you professionals go about managing
  the ragged edge?\r\n\r\nBig thank you in advance."

    it just deals with stuff like widows, imbalanced columns and such.\r\n\r\nI would
    really appreciate some more replies, because I'm quite concerned with this issue..."

  body: I use the "uniform lines" option of paragraph composer (not sure about the
    exact english wording). Then manually adjust where needed.

  body: "Yes, that. Painful when you have more than a paragraph, I know.\r\nAbout
    flexibility in spacing, that would negate the very aison d'\xEAtre of ragged text,
    wouldn't it?\r\nAnyway, have you tried a (Google) search of the forums? There
    is a good deal of tips on setting paragraphs."

    typographic decision, still it makes sense that the software should allow this.\r\n\r\nEric
    Gill used to set books ragged right, \"with compromise\", to achieve a nice, even
    rag. "
