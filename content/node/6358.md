body: I am currently working on my dissertation that is exploring the relationship
  that Jan Tschichold and Peter Saville have/had with society. The main sources I
  have read for Tschichold are The New Typography and Kinross&#39; Modern Typography.  <BR>
  <BR>Does anyone have any ideas for books and articles that I could locate on the
  Internet or Art School library. I can find many contemporary sources on Saville
  however these are slightly lacking with Tschichold.  <BR> <BR>All help is greatly
  appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Kind Regards  <BR> <BR>Stephen
