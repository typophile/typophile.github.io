body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nplease, I have a few questions about the kerning tables:\r\n\r\n-
  according to the specification: \"OpenType fonts containing CFF outlines are not
  supported by the 'kern' table and must use the 'GPOS' OpenType Layout table.\" Does
  it mean that fonts with \"cff \" table must not contain \"kern\" table? I saw fonts
  which do have both - do they violate the spec? If a \"cff \" font does not have
  \"GPOS\" table but has a \"kern\" table instead, is it fine to use it anyway?\r\n\r\n-
  if a font has both \"kern\" and \"GPOS\" (with kerning info) which table takes precedence?
  Should the other one be discarded?\r\n\r\n- in practice, how frequently are used
  \"kern\" tables written in other than \"format 0\"?"
