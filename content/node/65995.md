body: "<strong>Reviewing Typophile's Google Analytics reveals some interesting highlights
  from 2009. Presented in order of popularity, based on page views\u2026</strong>\r\n\r\n1//
  The high quality, free font, [[Quicksand]] from Andrew (aka <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/37327\">alienbreed</a>).
  The page had 127,035 views in '09 and is still going strong.\r\n\r\n2// This <a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61920\">handmade subpixel font thread</a> blew
  up on Typophile: (87,901 views)\r\n\r\n3// The hottest controversy of 2009? <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61222\">Ikea
  rebrands with Verdana</a>. (Still no comment from [[Matthew Carter]] -- the man
  behind Verdana, not the man behind Ikea's design decision.) As a personal note,
  I'm still smiling at someone's suggestion that they'll miss the \"warmth and cheer\"
  of Futura when they visit Ikea.\r\n\r\nThe second hottest controversy? <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/58625\">Apple's
  Menlo font</a> ([[Menlo]]) takes some heat for being a near duplicate of Bitstream's
  [[Vera]]. (To my knowledge it's not an intellectual property kind of heat, but a
  street cred kind of heat.)\r\n\r\n4// The <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/60577\">sub-pixel
  YouTube favicon</a> magic. This post got picked up by YouTube's web crew who had
  it implemented on the site. Nice work.\r\n\r\n5// And the hottest user submitted
  how-to of '09: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/47265\">Setting up a Baseline
  Grid in InDesign</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd other numbers?\r\n\r\n<strong>12,350 new users</strong>
  registered to the site. Welcome everybody. Reading the site does not require registration
  and, so presumably all of these people have something to say.\r\n\r\nUsers made
  <strong>8,650 type ID requests</strong> to the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/typeid\">Type
  ID</a> forum in 2009. The overwhelming majority of which were solved (identified)
  by actual humans, for free. A testament to goodness in the world.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Great list, Joe. Not necessarily related to popular content, but I would like
    to add that Hrant came back to us in 2009! :)

    I have a few screenshots I could donate.
