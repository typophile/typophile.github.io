    That\u2019s where those who really know this stuff hang out. (This is just the
    posh way of saying I have no clue whatsoever.)"

  body: "Hi Did you notice the phrase\r\n\r\n<blockquote>All topics are welcome\u2014except
    font ID requests.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nunder the heading of the forum where you
    posted this -- <strong>General Discussions</strong>? If you didn't notice it,
    would it help if it was bigger / bolder / blinking / in ALL CAPS? (No offense
    meant -- just trying to figure out why it gets ignored so often.)\r\n\r\nPlease
    ask in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/typeid\">the Type ID Forum</a>."
