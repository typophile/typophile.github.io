  (unfortunately) empty bottle of Smirnoff Vodka (UK duty paid) and admiring the relatively
  recently redesign, did I really count 25 different typefaces?"

  body: This is not "left field" question for this forum. You should have just titled
    the post "25 typefaces on a bottle". As soon as I get a chance to look at a Smirnoff
    bottle, I will offer a comment. Is it the same label in the US?

    of [[http://typophile.com/node/62789|this thread]], and of the following anecdote
    I posted therein:\r\n\r\nMatthew Carter tells the story of a time he was flying
    from the UK to the US and stopped in the duty free shop at Heathrow. He spied
    a bottle of Scotch whose label was printed using one of his types, so he bought
    it. As he exited the shop, a woman holding a clipboard asked him to take a market-research
    survey. When she asked him why he chose that particular brand of Scotch, he answered,
    \"Because I designed the type on the label,\" and watched as the researcher puzzled
    over her questionnaire for a check box that corresponded to that answer."
