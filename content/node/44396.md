  body: "Lately quite often just the beginning letters are used, aren't they: t(elephone),
    f(ax), (e-)m(ail), w(eb).\r\nFor symbols, Telephone, Fax and (e-)Mail seem to
    have more-or-less established symbols; true, web does not seem to have \"the one\".
    I think a globe pretty much gets the idea though, and it seems to be associated
    quite so with the web."

  body: In IT charts the Internet is often depicted as a cloud. Not so useful for
    airport signs in public I will admit but.... actually wifi is often synonymous
    with the web for public spaces. Maybe that's what you wanted. Maybe it's "Wifi"
    or bars for signal strength.
