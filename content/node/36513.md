    Latin, CE, cyrillic, greek \u2026? Yes!\r\n2. Helvetica-like? Well, it\u2019s
    a sans \u2026 but certainly not a Swiss grotesque.\r\n3. But is it decent? Oh
    yes!\r\n"

  body: When you say Helvetica-like, do you mean a Swiss grotesque, or will any sans
    do? There are certainly dozens of sans with the language support and range of
    weights you're looking for.

    Grotesk Pro seem to be a good match - Hypatia looks really nice but it has too
    much personality."

    as I know.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721/\">Swiss

    in only a few of its weights."
