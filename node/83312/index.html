  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,  I'm new to this forum and am rather uncertain about a specific issue:

I love beautiful objects and designs, and would like to feel  I can choose the fonts for the website I'm about to create ( my second  WYSIWYG site )  with regard to how they fit my overall design and concept.

But I keep seeing 'Websafe Fonts' in the list of fonts and am worried that if I stray too far and often from the 'safe' ones, my site will end up in chaos if it doesn't open properly, particularly on Windows PC's. 

I've heard that changing Titles etc to graphic items to make sure they look as intended makes the site open more slowly as well as then blocking being found by the search engines.

I'm on a mac, intending to use Freeway to create my site. THe first one was made in iWeb and I'm ready to 'go further' now.

I've heard about using Typekit as one means to overcome this situation, but don't know if this is a good solution. 

I've spent the last few hours absorbing much info from sites of Web Designers and having seen so many beautiful and unusual fonts, it occurred to me that it can't be so bad to use these !

I'd be really grateful for advice on this issue - being a 'learning-by-doing' person without technical know-how in this area.

Many thanks,  Kay.</div>

In facts almost all font sellers and foundries are offering web fonts as of now. Since you mentioned you're on a Mac most of them will look great to you, but you still have to do some homework. The problem that a lot of designers overlook is how these fonts look on machines running Windows XP. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Kay,

I suggest you look at the Google Web Font API here - http://link.io/e

This is in my experience one of the best font api's on the internet and is quite easy to use. To use a font you like all you need to do is insert a tag into the <head> section of your webpage. A javascript initializes and brings in the font imediately from the web. You will need to have the font installed on your local system if you are developing from your local machine or you would need to be connected to the net.

Most of the web fonts are free and you should be able to download and install them on your local machine.

I think this API is compatable with Internet Explorer 6 (Default on Win XP) which is what I gather Frank had raised concerns about.

Hope I helped!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's the web designer's responsibility to make sure that the fonts chosen for a web site work well in the site design, on different browsers.

Many typefaces originally designed for print, and properly hinted with alignment zones and stem width values, nonetheless look like crap on screen.

However, others only look like crap some of the time.

And there are others, where only certain weights look like crap, and other weights are just fine.

So web font distributors generally operate under the "caveat emptor" principle, giving their customers every option, but also giving them the ability to see how each font will be rendered in different environments.

The situation can be compared with print design, where it's the typographer's responsibility to, for instance, not use a hairline weight sans serif at small size.

As for the notion of "websafe" — this has nothing to do with how a site opens and loads.
Don't be scared to beat your own path, despite the extra effort required.

So <em>effectively</em> web font distributors sell lots of fonts that look like crap all the time. And they know that. And yet they still sell them.

Yes, that happens. It doesn't help that (1) many work on Macs and (2) many of them are nowhere near as educated about webfonts rendering than we'd hope, so I think many aren't even very aware that they'd need to check how a font performs under Windows. Many probably don't even check their stuff under Windows until when they do cross-browser testing, which might then also be too late to change the fonts if there is in fact a problem.

Re: «average computer» though, I'm a big proponent of linking the decision whether to use webfonts (and if yes, which ones at what kinds of sizes) to the – prospective or, if possible, actual – access statistics of the website in question. In some audiences the XP share is already so low that ignoring it wouldn't be more evil than, say, all the software that ignored the Mac back before it became Cool.</div>

But I'm sure you agree that revenge is not a good design parameter either!

--

Certainly the nature of the site being designed helps narrow down how to design it.
But exactly what kind of site can assume that XP users are less than, let's say 15%?

Now, let's think about sites that sell fonts: sure the person buying the fonts
is extremely likely to see the webfonts nicely... But that person will be using
those fonts to make sites that are mostly for "average" users!  :-/

It's typography, a discipline in which many fonts have specialized functionality.
Don't you consider it your responsibility as a typographer to choose the right font for the job at hand?
Isn't that a responsibility which you've embraced?

Certainly it's not disingenuous if the distributor posts samples of how each font renders in different environments, as MyFonts does.

How would you suggest a distributor go about vetting its suppliers' fonts for web appearance?
Would it be a requirement that every weight of every typeface render well in every Windows environment?
That's unrealistic.

Surely it's the web designer's job to make the judgement call, based on the size of the font that will be used, and knowledge of who the site's readers will be and what browsers they will be using.</div>

Web design isn't about giving everyone an equal experience. It's about recommending a particular experience, adjusting it as needed for all sorts of variables (browsers, OSes, user preferences, devices, screen sizes, etc, etc.)

I can't blame type designers for not magically making all their fonts work on a 10 year old operating system running decade old web browsers. 

I can't blame the web hosting services for not magically getting things to work either.

And I can't blame web designers who have decided it's time to move forward even if a few folks get a slightly degraded experience.

If it really matters to your particular web site's demographic, then don't embed CSS fonts. Or, at least, don't embed them for XP/IE users for now. Wait a few more years. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Staying away, for the moment, from some of the other assertions on this thread:

Nick Shinn said:
<em>"The situation can be compared with print design, where it's the typographer's responsibility to, for instance, not use a hairline weight sans serif at small size"</em>

Uh, nope. On the web, in a browser onscreen, the size at which the font will be viewed is unpredictable and cannot be forced upon the reader by the typographer.
The size will depend upon the size of the device's screen, the screen resolution, the pixel depth, and the zoom level. All of which are variables that you can't know beforehand.

It is a near-certainty that that hairline weight sans-serif <strong>will</strong> appear at a small size for some readers.
It may be adjusted by them, it might not. They might find the look of that font when it first appears small - with the hairlines disappearing - enough of a turn-off to just click off and read something else. You can't know. Restricting their use to what you think of as a "larger" size means nothing - it's all relative.

This is a fundamental difference between fonts aimed at print and fonts aimed at the web. It's more fruitful to think of a web font as being a collection of fonts designed to appear one way or the other at every pixel size setting.
With web fonts, "point size" as it's commonly thought of in print media, is a meaningless distinction.

		<div class="commentbody">I think you misunderstood my point Richard.

I was talking about the typographer's responsibility to choose a font that is appropriate for the document.

The example I gave, of not using a hairline sans for small text, was specific to print.
I didn't give an example for the web.

However, if a web designer IS considering using an ultra-light sans, they can inspect how various weights (Hairline, Ultra Light, Extra Light) of a typeface render in different environments, at different pixel sizes, at the font distributor's site, and make their own judgment call.

It's the web designer's option to decide that it's worthwhile choosing a font that renders poorly in certain situations, if it looks brilliant in the majority of situations.

Otherwise, designing for the lowest common denominator, one is cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.

Dealing with the "point of failure" in mind is the very nature of web design, where the variability of how the document displays produces a spectrum of quality.

For instance, compare:
http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/100/gallery.html
http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/300/gallery.html

Is it worth it to spec the 100 for headlines, where it will look real tasty 90% of the time, or do you play it safe with the 300, which looks a bit better when the page is tiny?

Safety vs. Design indeed.

		<div class="commentbody">Frode -- <cite>The single biggest issue, IMO, is the lacking documentation of the hinting tools.</cite>

The single biggest issue is that there are still rasterizers out there which expect that fonts tell them what to do, via hinting/instructions. And that those who make these rasterizers seemingly have no intentions to do anything about it. And that type designers and type foundries happily buy any diversions they get served so to not ask for nor even think about real solutions – which would be those that allow us to just design type. (Instead, type designers seem happy to discuss this or that hinting trick or how-to, at font-level, rather than than addressing the problem where it can be solved effectively, at rasterizer-level. To avoid one misunderstanding: There is no way around font-level fixes in short and medium terms, but that should not be mistaken for a long term solution. A little hint: If autohinting works, it can be done at rasterizer-level, so there is no need to bother type designers with autohinting at font-level.)</div>

Webfonts add just another layer to it.
Often it is because the designer is careless and/or (not so well) self-taught, and/or they want to use what is new and cool.
But there also is an inherent difficulty and expense in testing for all the possible configurations, and the even harder struggle to educate the client that sometimes it is better to compromise and have something that looks good on most cases, than something that looks perfect only on the client’s computer.</div>

Sure, it all depends on the site. 

These days I just do not use CSS embedded fonts for commercial work. It's just not there yet. 

That said, the fonts 'work' on IE. It's just not the prettiest experience. And people using antique non-standard browsers aren't used to a pretty experience anyways. So it's not as if you are denying them access to anything. 

"Remember that many people -like big companies- avoided Vista"

Yep. It's 2011 and my work machine is still XP. And IE7. To get any real work done we need to hack our own work machines to get Chrome and Firefox on and we spend a lot of time sneakernetting files to our personal MacBooks. The idiocracy of corporate IT departments. *sigh*.  ;o)


"the automatic stuff is *still* not good enough.

The problem is that people want to, and are using CSS embedded fonts regardless of the quality of the rendering. I'd say a lack of automatic hinting isn't *the* problem, but definitely part of the equation. </div>

I would appreciate it a lot if you and others would more clearly distinguish short-term perspective and long-term perspective. It would help you avoid drawing long-term (general/universal) conclusions from short-term (here-and-now) premises.
Your second sentence <em>would</em> be correct if you had added a "still" to it too, rather than jumping from a "still" in the premise to an implicit "once and for all times" in the conclusion.</div>

That's BS. Almost all sites that don't use webfonts look/read fine.
In fact, what's really unnerving is that for a fraction of a second
sites that use webfonts look fine, <em>then</em> the text becomes unreadable!  :-/

Antique, shmantique - we're the majority.
You ignore us, you will sell less stuff.

> To get any real work done

You mean to avoid reality.

I'm sorry, but all this "reasoning" is an escape from the harsh realization
that you still cannot fully express yourselves as designers. Do you think
I don't want this stuff to work?! Fonts is all I got! But we can't force it.

No. It's becoming more and more the standard way to build a web site. Most progressive web developers and designers have embraced the concepts of graceful degradation. It's becoming standard to be OK with IE users getting a lesser experience. We're not blocking them. They're just not getting all the bells and whistles. It's the pragmatic approach. We can't just stagnate waiting for people to stop using IE. IE users can keep using the site, but they don't get the rounded corners. Or fancy gradients. Or way-too-trendy rounded corners. 

To focus on web fonts, I'm in total agreement that we're not there yet. And yes, there are a lot of graphic designers thinking they are web designers using web fonts in all the wrong ways. </div>

But there's nothing graceful about illegibility.

I got this, Frode. Indeed some y-direction "hand-hinting" which fellow foundries sell (with or without noise) is not such a big deal in terms of time and competence it takes. But then, it does not even address all rasterizers that worry us here-and-now (unless one tweaks the description of here-and-now as to exclude some XP rasterization modes). And the way you look at it has an unfortunate implication. Those who should address the problem once and for all feel less urged to do so since foundries take it upon themselves to do, or have others do, rather dull work and "address the problem" per each font.
Again, I too do not see a way around hinting fonts for the here-and-now.

John – <cite>I wonder what the processing hit is for applying autohinting during rasterisation rather than reading hints from the font?</cite>

Some years ago people may have wondered about the processing hit for scaling and rendering fonts from outlines on-the-fly. :)
I am certain that executing TT instructions involves a bit more than reading them. Afaik, FreeType can do on-the-fly hinting, I have not seen comments that it is slow.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Do you have any experience with hinting, Nick? </em>

Yes, since I started the foundry in 1998.
(Although my script fonts don't have hinting.)
I took a workshop by Miguel Sousa at TypeCon 2007 which greatly improved what I was doing.

However, I haven't published any fonts with Delta hinting.
That's primarily because, following Adobe's lead, I had switched to publishing my fonts exclusively in ".otf" (postscript) format in 2005.
There was no reason for me to publish TrueType fonts for the web, as Microsoft and Carter had killed that market.
Then, since @fontface came along, my webfont distributors have taken care of producing the webfonts, adapted automatically from my ".otf" fonts.

Presently I am of two minds as to whether I should Delta hint, leaning towards taking a crack at it with my next (text) release. It's been painted as a tedious process, nonetheless, it would be an interesting challenge. And a duty, of course, as Alex and Hrant would have it.

It's unlikely that I will go back and Delta hint any of my previous designs, except perhaps Beaufort, due to its continued popularity, and how poorly the present webfont iterations perform.

It's also to easy put the blame on the user.

I'm observing foundries promoting their somehow manually hinted web-fonts as hand-hinted and/or presenting them with ideal screenshots or in flash-based viewers rather than putting a native preview online, which would make serious testing and reviewing possible.

I can understand that a graphic/web-designer which is licensing a classical typeface (form a major foundry), which is famous for it's readability, is expecting the web-font to be suitable for text sizes too. 
There are a just a few foundries which are warning officially, that the fonts are not jet ready for this purpose but rather should be used in display-sizes.

It would seem so, eh? Talk about elephants in the room.
But the problem is not XP. The problem is not restricted to an "old" operating system. Except for DirectWrite in IE9, what's different in Windows 7?

The problem is the Windows GDI api which still exists, as it must, in Windows 7 and it is the default font rendering engine for FF4, Chrome, Opera - every browser I've seen except IE9 which has DirectWrite as the default.

And IE9 didn't make it into the latest Windows 7 Service Pack release and that means it remains, for now, an upgrade.

The problem of converting fonts to TrueType and adapting them - to the extent they can be adapted - for comparatively low-res screens and GDI will be with us for many years.

<em>"I think you misunderstood my point Richard."</em>

No, I understood. I just cherry-picked to be abrasive in the spirit of good fun and lively conversation!

Last year it was obvious that the biggest barrier to making web fonts something that web designers would have no qualms about was the way most of them looked in GDI. In other words, hinting, hinting, hinting.
And while there are those who "simply don't give a shit" and say to hell with the users, I'm happy that Cool Hand agrees with me.
<em>"Again, I too do not see a way around hinting fonts for the here-and-now."</em>

(Hrant, of course, seems to firmly be in this camp, too.)

The mountain ain't comin' to Mohammed so Mohammed must go to the mountain.

The only question is: how high is the mountain?

What does it take to make a font look acceptable? (Look, the web-safe fonts don't look all that great in GDI either, so <em>some</em> degradation in comparison to DirectWrite and perhaps Mac or Freetype rendering is unavoidable and perfectly acceptable, within limits.)
Should it take an hour? Ten hours? Forty hours? What's practical? What's the state of the auto hinters that are available? Good, bad, what? And more importantly - since the only thing that counts in GDI (and, to a large extent in DirectWrite) is how the hinted fonts looks, how can the points and outlines be adjusted to work best with the auto-hinter? What features of certain fonts aren't auto-hintable? 
And on and on.
What I've found is that OTF with the rasterizer handling all point-to-pixel mapping issues, is extremely forgiving. An em unit up or down doesn't mean much.
But when you ask a separate program - an auto-hinter - to interpret the same points, an em unit up or down can mean a great deal.

Bottom line on this is: if there was a lucrative market in web fonts awaiting that those in the font business felt they could control to the extent that they do the market for print fonts, this problem would be solved already, guaranteed.

(How did the busking go in New Orleans, BTW?)

However, when auto-hinting is used, sans-serifs are very forgiving and, unfortunately, not a great measure of what the auto-hinter can handle or not handle. But, you usually do get a nicely hinted sans without a lot of hassle.
