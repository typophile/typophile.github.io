  an image of the font and if you prefer to visit it on the web you can see it at
  http://frndofthepeople.tumblr.com/ just the font used on the site name(\"logo\").\r\n\r\nI've
  been told it's Lucida Grande but it doesn't quite look right.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nPlease & Thank You!"
