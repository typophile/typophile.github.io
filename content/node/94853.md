  body: "Generally, I have found it useful to pose this kind of question to the people
    most likely to know the answer: like Samsung's marketing department or advertising
    agency-of-record. But that's just me: why make things simple, right?\r\n\r\nBoth
    \"versions\" are okay, but I have problems with both, which is why I applied the
    same basic principles in a slightly different way...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/iso-metrix-nf/\r\n\r\nNow,
    the \"whodunnit\" is removed from the mystery. Whether or not my solution represents
    the best of both worlds is entirely your decision. I'm a \"type designer\", not
    a mind reader\u2026although I would probably be a lot richer type designer IF
    I WERE a mind reader. However, I am not entirely sure that the upside of reading
    the current\" group mind\" would, in any way, outweigh the downside.\r\n\r\nIf
    you catch my drift. Which you probably don't. Consider yourself blessed, because
    my wife considers me touched\u2026and not in a good way.\r\n\r\nJust thought I
    would clue you in\u2026"
