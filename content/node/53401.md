  body: That's Bembo letterpressed into a very thick-looking paper. That being said,
    this post should be moved to the Type ID forum.

  body: I should also add that if you want a similar look from a digital font, you
    should use [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/searchresults.htm?st=1&kid=bembo%20Book|Bembo
    Book]] and not the old digital Bembo. Bembo Book has more authentic weight and
    proportions to the original metal.
