  body: "A humble question/rant from a design student: Can someone please remind me
    why we like Helvetica? Has anyone considered the shape of the uppercase \"R\"?
    The letterform indicates it doesn't know whether it's serif or sans-serif; it
    looks more like it belongs to something like Didot than to other characters in
    the Helvetica set. The lowercase \"a\" seems to have the same problem. Please
    see my examples below.\r\n\r\nI would have to say Gotham or Trade Gothic are much
    more beautiful than Helvetica and are true sans-serif typefaces\u2026even Futura
    has more consistent letterforms\u2026but it's a gutsy tattoo nonetheless! \r\n\r\nCory

  body: Now that I've got my little Hobo joke out of the way, let me ask a serious
    question. Why use a font for a tattoo at all? A font is an industrial product,
    a tool for making an infinite number of letters the same way every time. Tattooing
    is a hand process, perhaps the last imaging art to defy automation. For those
    who find tattoos beautiful, the beauty is that each stroke is unique, as organic
    as the body it's inked on.

    Adobe Garamond Pro. Though I have been told it deviates from a true Garamond slightly.
    Still if it were called Adobe Robert Slimbach Pro it would still be beautiful.\r\n\r\nI
    consider Adobe fonts to be of a good quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS - As your skin
    changes with age the counters and the kerning will all warp. Luckily its on your
    back. Otherwise it would become a bad obsession you could never correct. \r\n\r\nPPS
    - Its still pretty awesome you went through with it."

  body: "@PublishingMojo One word: Postmodernism. That's the beauty of tattoos. There
    is no standard. But even if there was a standard, each letter form was created
    by a human hand, imagined from a human mind. A fine typeface is a great art form.
    \r\n\r\nIt's silly for any designer to say that a typeface should be nothing but
    an industrial tool. I think we all know that that just isn't the case."

    balanced, and those slight flourishes that might resemble serifs help out with
    that. But the true beauty of it exists in its horizontal terminals that ground
    the letters, The bold negative space that make the forms recognizable even when
    you crop and distress the type, and the clean look that will adapt to anything.'

  body: Cross tattoos can have several meanings. While the most obvious one is in
    a religious context there are many other reasons to choose a cross as an idea
    for a tattoo. There is certainly no doubt that there is a sense of elegance with
    a cross tattoo, the simple outlay of the design enables you to personalize and
    really make it your own through a wide variety of means. Cross tattoos can have
    signigicant and personal meaning to its owner which is truly a statement of individualism.
