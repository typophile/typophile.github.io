  body: My understanding is that it&#39;s more of a &#34;within the year&#34; thing
    <BR>than a &#34;coming before the decade&#39;s up&#34; thing. <BR> <BR>It <i>does</i>
    take two or three years to complete, but production <BR>has been underway for
    a while now.  <BR> <BR>By the way, the new book is not merely an update to the
    last  <BR>edition. The content has shifted radically with new releases and  <BR>licensing
    changes so there is a lot of new work to do.

  body: Hehe. Apple&#39;s software is &#34;Font Book&#34; &#40;with a space&#41;.
    I share your  <BR>interest in an update, but that discussion deserves its own
    thread.
