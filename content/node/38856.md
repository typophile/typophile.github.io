    review yet... ;-)\r\n\r\n\"I WAS bemused by the blurb promotion of Alan Yentob\u2019s
    art show (Imagine, BBC 1, Tuesday).\r\n\r\nIt read thus: Helvetica ... as the
    popular typeface celebrates it 50th birthday, we mark the history of the \u2018Kate
    Moss of Fonts.\u2019\r\n\r\nWell, this was the Pete Doherty of a programme: a
    shambles.\r\n\r\nWhatever next? The Life and Times of The Clothes Peg or a Tribute
    to the Fire Extinguisher.\r\n\r\nMay I be so bold as to ask, just what was the
    point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
