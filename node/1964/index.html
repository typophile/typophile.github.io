		<div class="commentbody">Would it be helpful, to talk about the issue of font piracy from the &#34;I&#34; perspective, like it is customary in 12-step-programs? <BR> <BR>So here it goes, Dan - <BR> <BR>when I  started out as a young designer, I wanted to get my hands on as many fonts as possible and it did not occur to me, that going against the policies of one of those font companies would actually hurt a human being. Later, when I designed my first font, I realized, how much work went into it and my perspective shifted. Today, I try to be accountable for all my actions in my daily life, so I arrived at a place, where giving something back seems simply the natural thing to do. I hope you&#39;re not just stunned by the reactions to your post, but get actually something out of it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, here&#39;s the scenario running through my head. Dannyboy, or not necessarily him but anyone, posts a message not just on Typophile but say the MyFonts forums or AIGA or wherever. Even though we do our best to educate him &#40;and I do believe in educating them, one at a time, too&#41; say, hypothetically, he&#39;s not going to be converted. Then some lurker emails him privately: <BR> <BR>Font Trading: A Play in One Act <BR>by Dyana Weissman <BR> <BR>Lurker: Hey, Stereotypical Font Pirate, I have Magneto. What do you have to trade? <BR> <BR>Pirate: Well, I actually have the entire Font Bureau library, N-Z. Relay is peachy keen! <BR> <BR>Lurker: What a coincidence! I have the entire Font Bureau library, A-M. Let&#39;s trade! Amplitude sure is dandy! <BR> <BR>Pirate: Oh that&#39;s great! You know I have 30 friends who have been trying to get copies of Amplitude!  <BR> <BR>Lurker: I have 30 friends who have been trying to get their hands on Hoefler&#39;s entire library.  <BR> <BR>Pirate: Funny you should mention it, I have their entire library. Plus some fabulous gems by Peter Fahrni. <BR> <BR>Lurker: Great. Gotham Condensed is so nice. I&#39;ll trade you all the P22&#39;s I have for &#39;em. <BR> <BR>-End Scene- <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever a single act of piracy. Of course, my shamelessly plugged little scenario is catastrophizing, but this does happen all the time. I &#42;still&#42; have friends, who went to art school with me and know me personally and SHOULD KNOW BETTER! who &#42;STILL&#42; ask me to find them free fonts. Some people just don&#39;t care. My question is, when cases like this do arise, on Typophile or elsewhere, what should we do about them? Should we email the moderators with requests to have them removed &#40;after, of course, patiently trying to educate&#41;? Or is it a lost cause?</div>

But I was curious &#40;concerned?&#41; about Jared&#39;s comment that &#34;the board software logs the activity of the private messaging feature.&#34;  What exactly does this mean?  That people other than the recipient of the private message can read the message?   That seems a little  ... un-private, especially as that fact &#40;assuming it is the fact&#41; doesn&#39;t seem to be stated on the page where private messages are composed.  Just wondering, as there are all sorts of legitimate &#40;non-piracy-related&#41; reasons why someone would want to send a private message and be assured it is not read by others &#40;rather the point of sending a private message as opposed to posting on the board, yes?&#41;</div>

Thats really the closest thing you will have to privacy in this world. <BR> <BR>Consider the fact that you send email, through an ISP I suppose. There has to be somone to administer that mail server, correct? Somone set it up, and keeps it running. That person has access to all your emails, sent or recieved.

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, good, Kyle, your message helps me to clarify  my thinking and writing about this, as your response makes me realize my message sounded much more naive and off-the-point than it should have.  I certainly realize that private email isn&#39;t truly private, ever, but I don&#39;t think the ISP server administrator example is exactly on target here.  I can&#39;t really picture an administrator at msn/aol/earthlink routinely checking people&#39;s email for objectionable content.   And, as I understand it, it takes a court order for people outside the ISP to see that email &#40;in other words, some amount of privacy is generally regarded as expected&#41;.  &#40;However, I do know that employers routinely scan the mail of employees, so there are wide variations in expectations of privacy.&#41;   <BR> <BR>It seems, though, rather more that Jared is saying that private messages connected to controversial threads and/or to controversial posters is monitored and if the content of those private messages is unacceptable to the administrators, then the author of the private message is permanently kicked off the forum.   &#40;Though, that is really closer to your interpretation of what Jared said than anything Jared said.&#41;  I don&#39;t know ... the old lefty in me just finds that troubling, if true.  My problem.  But maybe a clarification is warranted.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To clarify: <BR> <BR>Dan &#40;dannyboy&#41; did not provide an email address in his profile. Conceivably the only way to contact him and initiate a trade would be to use a private message. We just wanted to be very explicit that if others contacted him via the private message feature the forum software would record it. <BR> <BR>We posted this at the risk of both scaring people away from the private message feature and sounding like the font police. These are the ugly consequences of people wanting to use our space to steal fonts. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s neither our practice nor our penchant to read private messages. But we can if there&#39;s the threat of illegal behavior. &#40;If we chose to look the other way we&#39;d be aiding that behavior.&#41; <BR> <BR>The private message feature is really just a convenience and it should continue to be just that. If you have sensitive, personal or private matters, use email or a telephone. At least then you know only strangers have the potential to listen in and not Jared and Joe. =&#41; </div>

		<div class="commentbody">For what it is worth ... <BR> <BR>My involvement here at Typophile has convinced me to get rid of all the illegal fonts that I had aquired. <BR> <BR>I used to grab &#39;em up on Usenet. I am sure you all know where ... Anyway, once I started to read and respond to people here that actually design and publish faces, I realized I was stealing. Also, I was able to put a human &#39;face&#39; to who I was stealing from. <BR> <BR>Well, I don&#39;t steal in any other facet of my life - why would I make an excuse to steal from type designers? So, I trashed the hundreds of faces I had on my HD. <BR> <BR>So, my point being - exposure to this community did have a &#42;very&#42; positive on my thinking and actions with regard to aquiring and possesing type for private use. <BR> <BR>Posting Dan&#39;s request here may not have been the right way to go about exposing him to the good people here. I am certain he could have been directed to a thread or two in the archives ...etc. <BR> <BR>I am glad for this community and can say it has helped me see things in a better paradigm with regard to type creation and ownership. <BR> <BR>Nuff Said.</div>

In the 80&#39;s a punk rock group called Blurt made a tune &#34;The fish needs a bicycle&#34; and at the time I made a painting of that idea. This is my 2003 version of it.
