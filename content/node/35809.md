  Dan Gayle into the Typecon2007 1980s party best male costume. Rather than the cocaine
  and New Order vibe, or the Flashdance vibe of the others, I instead opted for the
  80s midwestern white trash vibe. (The hat says Happy Days, by the way...)\r\n\r\nIt
  was awesome, because it added about 20 years to me, and no one recognized me at
  first glance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMGP2635_3739.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/20070428_0011_5954.jpg]"

    but I had no clue who was behind it.

    best look was the 5 sec blank stare I would get when I would speak to somebody
    who has met me previously. \r\n\r\nKent Lew just about fell over onto the floor.
    It was awesome."
