  me of New Clarendon, Volta, etc. but the serifs are all straight, the brackets are
  angular, and the counters differ significantly from the b & d  to the o.\r\n\r\nI
  have a client that is hung up on this exact typeface (they're also in a creative
  field), so any insight is appreciated. Thanks!"

    \"this looks like clarendon, but it's way too thin\". Haha.\r\n\r\nThe other suggestions
    are nice alternatives that I'll keep in mind. Thanks everyone!"
