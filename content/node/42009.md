  anyone tell me?"

  body: "Joel, \r\n\r\nsince the \"plain\" pseudo-quotes are separate characters from
    the \"typographic\" quotes, separately encoded in Unicode, a transformation from
    \"plain\" pseudo-quotes to \"typographic\" quotes should be done on the character
    level, by an application -- not on the glyph level in your font. Note that quotation
    rules are different for different languages. If your text is in English, then
    the typographic quotes \u201Care like this\u201D but if your text is in German,
    then the typographic quotes \u201Eare like this\u201C. Each language has its own
    specifics, and it is up to the application's (or up to the keyboard driver) to
    take those specifics into account. It would be very inefficient to expect that
    every OpenType font should carry quotation rules for dozens or even hundreds of
    languages, and it would be very difficult to maintain/fix/update this kind of
    information once the font is released. This is why the stuff does not belong in
    the font. \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio uses the AFDKO (Adobe FDK for OpenType) syntax

    at least i find it in amazon for 100 dollars ( http://www.amazon.com/Learn-FontLab-Fast-Leslie-Cabarga/dp/0965762858/ref=pd_bbs_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202896136&sr=8-7

    much money, the money from the works i do on youremin isnt much since the work
    isn't much and when i got the money i have to buy a lot of stuff. But about books
    what you council me? What books should i get for design or for typo ?\r\n\r\nJoel

  body: "Frank, \r\n\r\nyou do know that the \"crcy\" and \"dpng\" features have been
    removed from the OpenType specification version 1.25 back in July 2000? Generating
    fonts with those features makes them contradict the current OpenType standard,
    so I'm puzzled why DTL FontMaster tries to make them. If it really does generate
    them, it looks like all fonts made with DTL FontMaster so far that carry those
    features are not compliant with the most recent OpenType specifications 1.25,
    1.3 and 1.4. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    outline font to otf using FontForge (yes, I have permission to do this) and I
    find that the typesetting program (in this case XeLaTeX) does not correctly substitute
    the curled quote marks that are at U+2018 and U+2019 for the vertical \"apostrophe
    quote\". Yet with standard (bought) open type fonts it works fine. So there must
    be some flag somewhere in the font that the typesetting program reads to know
    to do this. And that flag must not be being set correctly in the conversion process.
    Does anyone know what that is and how I can correct it?\r\n\r\nThe curled quotes
    are definitely present in the font.\r\n\r\n(Tearing my hair out!)\r\n\r\nEl."
