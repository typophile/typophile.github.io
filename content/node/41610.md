body: as a creative director, it's an understood that we have to justify to the client,
  nearly every design decision-- especially why <strong>stringent use of typography
  is an undebatable must</strong>. but, for whatever reason, they are unwilling to
  allow a design agency to apply their professional thinking without a fight.  the
  client however, on the flip side, will not allow anyone else to downplay their 'professionalism'
  in what they do. it's a circle in which i have yet to find reason.  continue to
  butt heads until they finally see the light i guess-- i'm not really sure what else
  to say.

    kidding.\r\n\r\n\r\ni think there are a lot of reasons for this.\r\n\r\n1/ they
    are generally paying a good deal of money, for which they\r\nare somehow responsible
    (their job or the success of the company)\r\n\r\n2/ design has an inherently subjective
    component, so there will \r\nalways be room for debate (as opposed to other professional
    \r\nrelationships, e.g. if my construction manager tells me i need a\r\ncertain
    kind of concrete to carry the load, i am unlikely to argue)\r\n\r\n3/ design -
    especially with the advent of DTP - always feels \r\nsomewhat \"graspable\" by
    clients, i.e. the feeling that they can\r\ndo it themselves  - it's often difficult
    to quantify the value of\r\nour experience, expertise, and intuition.\r\n\r\nsometimes
    i think about finding a small, oceanfront town in italy\r\nwhere there is an old
    man who builds boats by hand and has no\r\napprentice because no one wants to
    do it anymore. i'd become his\r\napprentice and make wooden boats by hand and
    drink a lot of wine.\r\n\r\nthen i wouldn't have to deal with clients anymore.

  body: "Where did I recently read that all designers want\u2014not fame or fortune\u2014is
    to be respected. \r\n\r\nIf someone comes to us for design, we expect them to
    treat us as any they would any specialist and to know that what decisions we make
    are in their best interest and also that of the design. \r\n\r\nShe's a fickle
    mistress, this imaginary boundary. The one between doing what is right for the
    design and fighting for it to all ends or doing what the client wants and turning
    a blind eye to what isn't appropriate for the design. Some designers are graced
    with the ability to make the client believe that they're making all the decisions,
    but in reality the designer is making all the decisions. Alas, we aren't all blessed
    with this soothsayer talent.\r\n\r\nI feel your pain."

  body: "There's usually 2 issues:\r\n\r\nWhat the client wants vs. What they need\r\n\r\nTo
    resolve this, I think there are 3 necessary roles:\r\n\r\nThe designer\r\nThe
    client\r\nThe person that can communicate between the two\r\n\r\nFrom experience,
    I think that 3rd role is the key, and is often what is missing. For better or
    worse, that role is often best played by a person with good 'sales' personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hmm, I think in that town you will find someone who tell you to write something
    like "Mari del Sud" in Comic Sans 720pt just on the stern of your wooden boat.

  body: while jarrod says,<em> "design has an inherently subjective component,"</em>
    it's possibility more important to remember that it primarily has an objective
    component at its heart. to some degree, we're making shirts, and we have to keep
    in mind that we're not the ones who will have to wear them. the client will be
    wearing them, and they are the ones who should feel the most comfortable.

  body: Indeed, that 3rd role I mentioned really requires someone who is good at communicating
    and bringing the objective criteria to the forefront, and then explaining the
    subjective criteria in a way that's easy for both sides to digest.

    i have between me and the\r\nclient, the more difficult i find it.\r\n\r\n@Daniele-\r\ni
    will provide the boats as is, and if they want to\r\ncarve Comic Sans in, they
    will be free to do so. =)"

    versa. Thats in general, of course.\r\n\r\nKNOWING when you need to bring in another
    person to fulfill are particular role is the key."

  body: That's kinda how the print house I used is set up, I don't ever speak directly
    to the printing staff, just one woman. She's an account consultant, the middle
    person between me and the printers, if I have any questions she fields them all.
    I haven't been in a position to yell at her, but I imagine that she'd do a very
    good job of smoothing things over and calming me down.
