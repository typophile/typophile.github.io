body: "Hi guys \u2014 I'd appreciate your comments on the attached pdf. I'm trying
  to decide between both versions, questioning the tail of the 'y'. All other comments
  welcome.  The 's' also seems slighly heavy to me. \r\nThe id is for myself, acting
  as the face to my graphic design services."

  body: "I know that geometrically \"S\" is ok in the middle but visually it looks
    broken. Correct that. Its weight also looks heavier as other letters'.\r\n\r\nI
    like the second one more, but it reminds me of the YOSHO (90560) because of the
    \"Y\" style.\r\n\r\nSince it's about seeing. There's a nice \"eyes\" pattern with
    \"e\"s at the end. Add some eyebrows or eyelashes maybe. Try and play.\r\n\r\nBut
    I like the cleanness of it. Very clean very nice. Less is more. Just make it memorable
    somehow."

  body: "to me, the treatment of the \"y\" is better on the first example. i don't
    know why, but that one i read as \"you see\", while the second registers with
    me closer to \"yowsa.\"\r\n\r\nrobert is right about the \"s.\""

  body: "I prefer the 'y' in number 2. The tail in number 1 makes it look more like
    a 'u', which may be good in that that is the sound made by the word (yoo), but
    it looks odd. I think you right to refrain from the eyes and eyelashes.\r\nAny
    thoughts on colours or a supporting image at this point?"

  body: "I would work on reducing the weight in the curved parts of the letters \u2013
    there is a horizontal weightiness at the top and bottom of most characters, and
    try a more geometric s based on the shape of the e with a horizontal crossbar.
    A little bit of overshoot on the curved characters could help the baseline which
    is dragged down by the y, or you could exaggerate it to make a small feature of
    it. The transition from vertical to curved in the inside of the y,o,u is a bit
    abrupt.\r\n\r\nTim"
