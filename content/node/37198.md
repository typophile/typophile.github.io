body: "I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to substitute the first letter of
  a word for an alternate version. I don't want the rest of the s's in the word to
  swap also like how standard swashes would work. I'd like it to be automatic so you
  don't have to hit the alternates every time.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can think to
  do it is to substitute the s using the space before the word as a ligature. But
  that doesn't help when there is other punctuation going on.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? "

  body: "This isn't a great option because it only works with InDesign CS3, but we
    started supporting the OpenType features <code>'init', 'fina', 'isol',</code>
    and <code>'medi'</code> which can be dynamically applied to characters. These
    correspond with \"initial letter\", \"final letter\", \"isolated letter\" and
    \"medial letter\". It is only semi-smart, but can handle punctuation around words
    for example.\r\nA more universal approach involves some complex contextual processing
    which is why Thomas Phinney suggested adding support for the positional forms
    feature."

  body: "Create a class that contains all glyphs that are letters (or anything else
    you consider to be part of a word). Then, set up a contextual substitution in
    which if a glyph is not preceded by a member of that class, use the alternate.
    \r\n\r\nHere's one way to do it. In the following code, the classes are defined
    thus:\r\n\r\n<code>@letter</code> = any glyphs you consider part of a word;\r\n<code>@normal_letter</code>
    = any glyphs that have a different form for the beginning of a word\r\n<code>@alternate_letter</code>
    = the alternate versions of the glyphs in <code>@normal_letter</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    contextual substitution (to be placed in the <code>calt</code> feature):\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\_\_\_lookup
    beginnings  {\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_ignore sub @letter @normal_letter' ;\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_sub
    @normal_letter' by @alternate_letter;\r\n\_\_\_} beginnings;\r\n</code>"

    If not, then make sure you've got all your ticks and semicolons accounted for...

    What If I have dupes for all 26 letters? Do I need to make classes for each letter?
