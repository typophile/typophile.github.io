    true, I'd say the Andron series, DejaVu and the 'GNU' fonts are possible candidates.\r\n\r\nIf
    the OP is looking for lettershapes that imply multiculturalism... I think that
    mounting an RK05 read/write on a Windows machine would be easier, even if starting
    from scratch."

  body: Hi, yes I mean "a Latin typeface that expresses non-Western cultures" but
    a 'nice' one if that makes sense? (A non-cheesy one, if they exist)...

  body: "As I said before, There Be Dragons. This is something\r\nsome people (out
    of some vague fear?) take too far,\r\nto the point of precluding good design.\r\n\r\nThink
    about it this way: if classical Roman caps express\r\nEurope to a greater extend
    than they express let's say the\r\nNear East, there <em>must</em> be a way to
    express what you want.\r\n\r\nHere's the one concrete suggestion I feel quite
    safe making:\r\nFind a typeface with inverted contrast - where the horizontals\r\nare
    (gently) thicker than the verticals. This is something that\r\nremains pretty
    alien to the West, whereas it's entirely natural\r\nfor Arabs, Jews and Indians.
    But it doesn't ruin readability.\r\n\r\nLook at the work of Excoffon and Bloemsma,
    and FontBureau's Trilby.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Cody are cheesy. Both are based on Oriental (Japanese and Korean resp.) brushwriting.

    I was just thinking about today because I noticed that it has a strong resemblance
    to [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Stellar+Classic+SG&q=Go|Stellar]]. Of
    course Stellar is just a weighted sans-serif, but the x-height and other such
    characteristics are very similar."
