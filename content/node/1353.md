  paintings owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber has a nice surprise in the last room: a glass
  case containing eight or nine Kelmscott Press books. These haven&#39;t been mentioned
  in any review I read, and most of the people there didn&#39;t seem terribly interested
  in them, but having waded through all the stuff in the previous rooms &#40;like
  one of ALW&#39;s musicals, the show is too long, very repetitive and left me feeling
  slightly nauseous&#41;, they were like a long cold drink.'
