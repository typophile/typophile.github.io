  intending to use Alegreya and Alegreya SC as the title and blurb faces. \r\n\r\nBeing
  cautious of free downloads off Google Web Fonts or Font Squirrel, I always try to
  go an obtain my copies of 'free' fonts from the foundries themselves (to confirm
  they actually are free and haven't been been pirated on the free sites).\r\n\r\nI've
  found that Alegreya and Alegreya SC can't actually be downloaded from http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/tipografias/alegreya/ejemplos.html.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone else had experience with these fonts, and can confirm that the licence does
  permit commercial use without any payments?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    roman a, f, g, and r need a lot of work. The m, n, v and y need some width-sizing
    work. But that's what libre fonts are for...\r\n\r\nAnyone see anything else in
    the lowercase roman alphabet? The lowercase italic is a little spiky, but I think
    that's a current fashion. An alternate \"g\" would be useful.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Wow. It seems that another Argentine beauty has emerged from Google Webfonts.
    I do wonder why the small caps were implemented as a separate font rather than
    as an OpenType feature, though. Does WebKit (and thus Chrome and Android) lack
    OT feature support still? '

    of time getting it ready for print use.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I believe Chrome does
    lack OT support."

    \r\n\r\nAll the fonts in Google Webfonts can be used for commercial projects.
    \r\nNo Restrictions!\r\n\r\nDonation to the designers is always a good idea, although
    not a requirement."

    separate files, other way most browser will generate fake small caps."

  body: "@mjkerpan &ndash; To amplify a bit on Pablo's comment: Browsers will all
    too often fake small caps even if there are real ones in the font. Having a separate
    small-caps font helps getting around that. You could have a class <code>.smcp
    { font-variant: small-caps; }</code> and later change it to <code>.smcp { font-family:
    \"Alegreya SC\"; }</code>.\r\n\r\nIf y'all think it's crazy, take a look at Almendra.
    Almendra SC is both Swash Caps and Small Caps. Stir Crazy?"

  body: "The professional layout apps rationalize their faux-ing capabilities on the
    grounds that not all typefaces have the true features that users demand.\r\n\r\nTo
    this day, Adobe\u2019s InDesign does not tell users which styles of Adobe Caslon,
    for instance, are being rendered in true small caps, and which in faux. (The only
    way to tell is to check whether \u201CAll Small Caps\u201D is avaiable in the
    OT menu.)\r\n\r\nThankfully, InD and Quark no longer offer users faux italic and
    bold buttons.\r\n\r\nI would say, if you respect the user, don\u2019t give them
    faux if the real thing is not available, let them know\u2014don\u2019t pull the
    wool over their eyes and give them second best because they don\u2019t know any
    better. Is that any way to treat your customers? Furthermore, faux-ing provides
    a disservice to the fonts being fauxed with, because it presents them in a less
    than ideal light. Is that any way to treat a third party\u2019s products? And
    \uFB01nally, fauxing is a ball and chain which hampers the progress of typography."
