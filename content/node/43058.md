body: This font appears on the film poster for Bruce's Weber's documentary "Let's
  Get Lost" from 1988. It looks alot like Kuenstler to my eye, but less slanted. Any
  ideas? Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/check_5081.jpg]

  body: Yes - do you have any ideas? The linotype Kunstler face is pretty close, and
    I was thinking of messing with it in Illustrator a bit to get the same effect.
    But do you know of something closer?

    at the 3 \u2018e\u2019s, you can see that they\u2019re not identical. I don\u2019t
    think there were any fonts with such subtle alternates around in the late eighties.\r\nAre
    you looking for alternatives, too?\r\n\r\n[edit] Nah \u2026 I first thought that
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/englische_schreibschrift_bold_ot_std/?sample_text=Bruce%20Weber&sample_size=48\">Englische

    Script</a> might be a little closer, but in fact, K\xFCnstler Script is pretty
    good.\r\nUnfortunately, they all have the \u2018wrong\u2019 r, even the OpenType
    versions \u2013 no alternates. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wilton/diplomat/\">Diplomat</a>
    features the desired form.\r\n\r\nA fresh Anglaise, also with the \u2018right
