  body: I'm not sure why I'm not being allowed to attach a .jpeg or .bmp, but the
    lettering can be seen at www.acdcontracting.com, what I'm looking for is the font
    for the name "AC&D Contracting". Sorry about the pasting issue if it didn't attach
    correctly here. Any help will be greatly appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AC&D
