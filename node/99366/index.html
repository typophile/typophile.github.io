  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of revivals of old typefaces taken from printed sources to the digital realm. This kind of work really interests me and I have a question in this regard: is an ethical thing to do? I mean, copying a design from a printed source and making a digital font? What do copyright says in this regard?</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifications</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve wondered the same.  If you&rsquo;re in North America, then <em>legally</em> speaking it seems to be fine&hellip; since you&rsquo;re only copying the design and not mathematical/programmatical font data, and font designs themselves are not protected by copyright law.  (In other countries/regions you should definitely check what the IP laws there say about type designs).</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s <em>ethical</em> is getting into a rather murkier area.  Inasmuch as I&rsquo;ve been able to sense any kind of general consensus amongst type designers, it seems to be that type design really <em>ought</em> to be copyright-able even if it isn&rsquo;t; and so I get the impression that there&rsquo;s a kind of &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s understanding&rdquo; (apologies to the ladies among us) that the proper thing is to behave as if they were.</p>
<p>For myself, at least for now I&rsquo;ve tentatively decided to adopt the approach that a design is fair game for revival or reinterpretation if it would be out of copyright under local law (in my case, Canadian law) if it actually were copyright-able.</p>

The ethics will be perceived differently depending on whether it&rsquo;s a previously undigitized specimen from an 1893 foundry catalog or a printed sample of a current Linotype or Adobe digitized font. And, since font NAMES can be copyrighted, and font designs can be patented, there are also other considerations.</p>

<p>Producing facsimiles is single-cell organism stuff. OTOH, improvement and adaptation sound pretty much like Evolution to me. Overall, the concept has worked pretty well—or, at least, well enough until humans got the notion that we had a Better Idea of how the show ought to be run…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking of Oz Cooper (which you were in another thread) — I found the fonts that were evolved from his sans hateful, despite the fact that Dave Farey is such a nice guy. If somehow I had been Oz and seen what Dave did I would have said, why did you change <em>that</em> and <em>that</em> and <em>that</em> — don’t you know I made them like that for a reason?!</p>
<p>And it’s not really a fair evolutionary ﬁght if the original doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>So I would say the ﬁrst duty of a revivalist is to make sure that the designer’s work is available authentically, not just the interpretation.
When I was working on the Modern Suite, I did that for the Scotch, but not for the Figgins Sans, and I now regret that. (I had changed the /G, for instance, adding a crossbar for the beneﬁt of today’s readers who might mistake the original for a /C.) The principle here is letting the market/typographer/user decide how to use the font, rather than assuming one knows what they want.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not as bad as insider trading, or practicing law, or running an election campaign. But compared to what a type designer <em>could</em> be doing I think there is in fact something fundamentally wrong with it. Others (such as Gerard Unger, and Nick Shinn, at least in a former self :-) have also expressed such views.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I got a lot of ﬂak here for saying so.
Nobody likes to be told their work is second rate by someone who thinks they’re better.
It was also very hard to convince people that Myriad and Helvetica aren’t original designs!</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t think there is anything wrong with reviving old designs, and there is a market for them, and they serve many useful purposes—my biggest beef was that I don’t think revivals are type design, they’re technical/styling work. Robin Nicholas made a similar point in the recent <em>Eye</em> special on Monotype—that he didn’t think of himself as a type designer, that was what Herman Zapf did (although I would disagree with him on that count, as he has done some quite original work, as well as things like Arial).</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are some problems with criticizing those who work in the same industry, and, considering the shades of grey between original and knock-off, I now think it’s better to accentuate the positive (I’m writing something on Karloff for Typographica’s Best of 2012), and make any argument through my work. But I’ll still discuss this issue here, hopefully in a more nuanced manner than the past.</p>
