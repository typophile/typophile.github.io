  out there to recognize the typefaces used in the headline and body copy. Thanks.

  body: "The headline font is an uneven sans, similar to Peignot Light or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olradiant/\">OL
    Radiant</a> by Dennis Ortiz-Lopez. \r\n\r\nThe body text looks like a typewriter
    font (monospaced).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
