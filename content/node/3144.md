  body: Richard - I hadn&#39;t actually noticed the different serifs &#40; the titles
    &#39;serifS&#39; was accidental&#41;. It was the bracketed ones that interested
    me. Also I was particularly interested in the ampersands because I haven&#39;t
    managed to find anything similar. <BR>Fabio - that would make sense. I thought
    it looked kind of 70s. Do you know of a font that matches the logo? <BR>Is there
    a digital version available that has these ampersands?

  body: Phil, was looking through my old Andresen  &#40;Typographics, in L.A.&#41;
    catalog and found Firenze and Florence with this type of alternate ampersand.
    A little less similar, but still in the ballpark are Didoni-Vixen, Mod Caslon
    and Pistilli Roman. These may or may not exist as digital fonts with these same
    names today. Good luck hunting. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Useless information no135 <BR> <BR>I have an old &#40;late 70s early 80s,
    no covers, so no date&#41;Letraset catalogue here that has a Bauer Bodoni Bold
    NOT italic with the same ampersand. <BR> <BR>However all the digital versions
    I&#39;ve seen have the more conventional style. <BR> <BR>

  body: Thanks for the information M. Alyce and Richard. I&#39;ll keep looking. I
    am however a little pessimistic about finding those ampersands. It seems to me
    that digital versions of many classic fonts don&#39;t include those fantastic
    alternates.

    border=0> It made my day. <BR>I originally thought you were looking for a typeface  <BR>with
    elegant serifs and a lot of character. &#40;pun intended&#41;

    was the correct term - if it isn&#39;t it certainly should be.
