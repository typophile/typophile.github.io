    used to type this, or are you looking for a digital font that looks similar? Is
    that the best image you have?"

  body: Russ, welcome to Typophile. You'll find that most users of this site are happy
    to help a fellow professional (or non-professional) tackle a creative problem.
    On other hand, most of us are wary of providing litigation support without compensation,
    and without even knowing whether we're witnesses for the plaintiff or the defendant.
    I think you'll get more helpful responses if you share a bit of why you need to
    identify these letters.

  body: "I wouldn't have any particular qualms about helping you if I could, but the
    image is so fuzzy and pixelated, and the text so short, that narrowing it down
    to a specific model seems nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen do you think this document
    was typed? Is there a particular machine that you're trying to prove could or
    could not have typed it?\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, letting us know what this is all about
    might help \u2014 not only to put our consciences at ease, but also to help us
    look at your question from the right direction."

    Olympia Typewriter, named [[http://www.dafont.com/splendid66.font|Splendid 66]].
    \ The unique combination of that particular '5' and the open '4' tends to eliminate
    most candidates.\r\n\r\nand, not as close, \r\n\r\n2) [[http://www.dafont.com/typewriter-royal-20.font|Royal

    Royal 200 .\r\n\r\nThe text  (Jan and Apr) in your image is too garbled to be
    of any use.\r\n\r\n- Herb"

    could see opinions posted here being used to guide a lawyer's thinking about a
    case, but its unlikely that they'd be submitted as evidence in a trial. A lawyer
    would need to present the poster's credentials to establish them as an expert
    witness, plus these posts are not made under oath, and the poster cannot be cross-examined.
    \r\n\r\nA member of my family frequently works as an expert witness and it's a

    must be defended.\r\n"
