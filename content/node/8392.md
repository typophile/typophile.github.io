  body: Sadly, it wouldn&#39;t have been a funny joke then, but a normal occurance.
    There were quite a few female typesetters, but I don&#39;t think that they often
    got to advance higher than that

  body: Given the fact that the first secretaries were male, it was a natural progression
    for men to become typesetters. <BR> <BR>There were women who were involved with
    publications &#40;mostly writing of course&#41; and printing, beginning in the
    colonial era. &#34;Amelia Bloomer advocated dress reform, temperance, and women&#39;s
    rights in <i>The Lily</i>, which she began in 1849. Her later decision to employ
    only female typesetters met with opposition from male printers.&#34;  &#40;Now
    that&#39;s earlier than I had imagined!&#41; <BR> <BR>It wasn&#39;t really until
    the 1920s that women took up jobs in the typesetting field &#40;that men would
    have had&#41; - and even then, given the choice, most women pursued journalistic
    roles. &#40;This might have had something to do with the fact that they didn&#39;t
    earn equal pay for the same job until the early 1960s.&#41; <BR> <BR>I read that
    in the US, in 1989, only 7.5 percent of engineers were women. Interesting eh?

  body: Famously, Monotype&#39;s drawing office was staffed almost entirely by women
    from, I believe, the 1930s. These were not type designers per se -- that was a
    field almost entirely dominated by men, although there were women lettering artists
    who contributed to fine press book design &#40;Anna Simons&#39; work for the Bremer
    Presse is probably the best known and most highly regarded&#41; --, but the people
    responsible for the precise manufacturing drawings.

  body: '&#62;it was a natural progression for men to become typesetters. <BR> <BR>There
    is no such thing as a &#34;natural progression for men&#34;. In the first place,
    women have been left out of the history books, their contributions generally attributed
    to their spouses&#42;. This is especially true where the family is the business,
    rather than the factory, and that was the usual situation before the Industrial
    Revolution with its specialization.  <BR> <BR>Did printers&#39; guilds prohibit
    women from working in a print shop? It&#39;s a subject for specialist research,
    but I suspect that from the earliest days of typography, there was always a percentage
    of practising women. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Even in modern creative partnerships,
    the woman&#39;s name is the lesser in public awareness: Charles Eames, 177,000
    Google search results; Ray Eames, 113,000. <BR> <BR>Secondly, the UN-natural &#34;progressions&#34;
    are far more interesting. Such as the introduction of the typewriter in the 1870s,
    quickly monopolized by women, becoming a key instrument &#40;sorry&#41; of their
    financial emancipation.'

    the type of pun I expect on this board. I offer you a ribbon for your striking
    turn of phrase.
