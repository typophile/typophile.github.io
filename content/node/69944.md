  myself a bit so i would like to try out something ive never did before\r\n\r\nHere's
  the thing, for the first time i'm trying to make a business letter template that
  every employee (at my imaginary company) should use with the logo on top, adres,
  subject of the letter...etc.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to do this...i'm guessing
  an Indesign template is out of the questions so the most popular text editor for
  the office guys is still \"Word\". does this mean that i would need to create the
  entire layout in Word... margins..etc or is there another way to do this? to be
  honest Ive never actually did a layout in word really :/.\r\n\r\nOr is the most
  usual way of going about this to design the A4 paper in indesign, place logo, adres..etc
  in Indesign and just work with pre-printed sheets?\r\n\r\nHow do you guys actually
  go about doing a job like this\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well there's several ways of doing this:\r\n\r\n1) Design in design program
    of your choice then send to a printer. Then in your traditional word processor,
    set-up margins to correctly use the pre-printed letterhead. Put the pre-printed
    letterhead into your printer and print.\r\nPros: Can get full bleed (edge to edge
    printing) look which will set it apart from most business printed documents.\r\nCons:
    Costs more to do, requires some user intervention (add the correct paper to printer
    before printing)\r\n\r\n2) Create a design (using whatever design application)
    and then create a template in your word processor, and place your designed artwork
    as a background in your word processor template. Be aware of your printer margins
    and design for them (the white margins where the printer can't print).\r\nPros:
    Cheaper and it's easier for less technically proficient staff to use\r\nCons:
    Hassle of setting up your Word processor template and getting the artwork in and
    looking right, no full-bleed, can look generic without the full bleed."

  body: "Evie,\r\n\r\nMost of my clients are small or non-profit so I usually end
    up making them a letterhead in inDesign first, for proofing and because inDesign
    doesn't suck, and then I transfer all the graphics into a word document.\r\n\r\nEven
    if you do a print letterhead you will have to specify margins, as MS Word default
    margins are too small. In which case you may like to create a word template with
    the margins set so the client's writing doesn't print right over the art.\r\n\r\nYou
    can get even more fancy by setting up header styles and body copy styles in word
    -- which your client will promptly ignore.\r\n\r\nThis link has an accurate and
    easy to understand tutorial on the subject:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativepro.com/article/hergeekness-says-convert-custom-letterhead-microsoft-word-templates\r\n\r\nOne
    drawback is when you place the art in word it automatically greys out when the
    client is using it to write. This is because the art must be stuck in the footer,
    regardless of where on the page it sits, so that it is not accidentally moved
    around.\r\n\r\nThen the client asks, \"Please make it not grey.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it
    goes on from there.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Evie/Carolina,\r\n\r\nWhat would be wrong with creating the template in Word?
    It\u2019s not rocket science. I\u2019ve been doing that for many years. MS Word
    has all design tools you need. You only have to recognize, and to use it as yet
    another <em>design tool</em>. In many ways it is less complex and sophisticated
    than QuarkXPress or InDesign, but it is one very reliable program that allows
    you to fine-tune your typography to an appropriate degree: paragraph and character
    styles, font sizes to 0.5 pt., leading to 0.05 pt., tracking to 0.05 pt., horizontal
    scale to 1%\u2026 just don\u2019t forget to enable kerning (it\u2019s not automatic
    in Word). To a certain extent using Word after InDesign feels like driving a stick-shift
    car after an automatic. Yes, it\u2019s not for the sissies\u2026\r\n\r\nOne tip:
    in <em>Document</em>\u2026 > <em>Layout</em> set up the <em>Headers and Footers</em>
    as \u2018Different first page\u2019. That would let you use your company\u2019s
    head-piece on the first page, and the continuation page headers and automatic
    folios on the subsequent pages."

    you'll get inferior results because they'll be printed on office printers that
    have nowhere near the quality that you'd get if they were professionally printed
    letterheads. \r\n\r\nThe logo will shift color depending on which printer is being
    used, and if toner levels are low the logo might print in the wrong color entirely.\r\n\r\nMuch
    better from a quality standpoint to design the letterheads in InDesign, have them
    professionally printed, and then create a Word template for typing the letter's
    content.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "renkceurb,\r\n\r\nHi. I don't have a solution for not making it grey. Well
    I guess I have a solution, which is to explain to the client/user that it will
    appear grey and there's no way around it.\r\n\r\nIf they are sending out the letterheads
    over the internet I explain the process of print to PDF (then the art is full
    colour, or fully black rather than tinted back).\r\n\r\nThey should allow header
    view in MS Word, because this does come up a lot. \r\n\r\nAnd very few of my clients
    will ever print stationery. In fact, it seems they are all swinging as far away
    from print as they can -- but I bet they will correct their behavior over the
    next year or two (ie: a balance of communication methods)."
