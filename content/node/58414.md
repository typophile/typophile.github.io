  from the early 1980s, I also discovered his 'free fonts' on a site hosted by British
  Telecom;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_6648.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow
  I'm sure this is wonderful news for all you Joy Division/New Order fans out there,
  BUT as far as I can see, these are all typefaces that go by standard industry names
  anyway\r\n\r\nCloser = Trajan\r\nBlue Monday = Engravers Gothic?\r\nLow Life = Futura\r\nRepublic
  = Univers Condensed Bold Oblique?\r\nSubstance = Bodoni?\r\nTechnique = Helvetica
  Neue Black Oblique\r\nAtmosphere = Wim Crouwel's New Alphabet?\r\n1993 = New Handel
  Gothic\r\nCeremony = Albertus\r\nWorld = Serpentine\r\n\r\nAre these cuts unique
  to those particular projects or am I (like with the colour-code-typography) missing
  something here?"

  body: "That site has been discussed here a bunch of times. Essentially, IIRC, it
    seems that those fonts are (a) pirated and (b) not the ones that Peter Saville
    actually used. Plus, that site is not Saville's own, but a fan site.\r\n\r\nCheck
    this thread, for example: http://typophile.com/node/32322\r\nThere was more. I
    wish search was working."

  body: Thanks Altaira. I've deleted the url FWIW, and I did search before I posted
    this but ha! if the search ain't working... either way, that'll teach me to believe
    what I see on the web.
