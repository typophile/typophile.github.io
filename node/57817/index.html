		<div class="commentbody"><p>That claim by Professor Giorgio Stabile of his discovery of the @ sign in a document of 1536 has been doing the rounds for years, but to be fair to the professor he doesn’t claim it in quite these terms.</p>
<p>“One can’t say this is the first example of its use, as ancient financial institutions may have earlier examples lying forgotten in their archives,” Stabile said over iced tea in Rome’s scenic Piazza Navona. The professor discovered the document while doing research for a visual history of the 20th century, which is due to be published by the Treccani Encyclopedia. In the document a trader called Francesco Lapi describes the arrival in Spain of ships bearing treasure from Latin America. “There an amphora of wine, which is one thirtieth of a barrel, is worth 70 or 80 ducats,” Lapi wrote in his letter, sent from Seville to a colleague in Rome. “No symbol is born by chance,” Stabile said. “This one has represented the entire history of navigation on the seas and has now come to typify travel in cyberspace.”</p>
<p>I forget where I found this fancy piece of stuff, but it is all over the Web.</p>
<p>What I wonder is, how many early financial documents Stabile looked at. Italy was the home of some very sophisticated accounting practice a long time before the 16th century, and there are plenty of surviving archives that have been studied. I shouldn’t be surprised to learn that there is a symbol looking like @ in much earlier documents from one of the big trading or banking centres like Venice, Genoa, Milan or Florence. It might be worth asking one of the economic historians who read these archives.</p>
<p>And I’m no palaeographer, but I personally doubt if @ has anything to do specifically with amphoras of wine. (But just a moment. Wine imported to Europe from the New World in 1536. That has to be a first.) Or with the Spanish weight called the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->arroba<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->arroba<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is derived from Arabic, and probably dates from a long time before the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reconquista<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Maybe there is a symbol for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->arroba<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (or even the amphora) that looks a bit like @. Incorrigibly sceptical as I am, I suspect that the term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->arroba<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was only recently adopted as a convenient Spanish (and French) name for a symbol that didn’t have one. If there is proof to the contrary, please let us see it.</p>
<p>Less excited historians do indeed seem to agree that the modern @ is simply a flourished form of Latin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (at), for use in repeated lines of accounts containing phrases like “so many pounds or barrels of something at – @ – so much per pound/barrel”. Commercial documents are full of abbreviations or symbols for other Latin commercial terms like £ (capital L) for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->libra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (pound as currency), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (for which we keep the Latin word), % for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per centum,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &amp; for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->et<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The so-called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->solidus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or forward slash (maybe a long s) for dividing shillings and pence (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->solidi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->denarii<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is another. So we are lucky that the computer keyboard – which is a typewriter keyboard (and typewriters were designed as office machines) – was not cluttered with the symbols for more of them, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which can be quite elaborate. These symbols were made as types for commercial printing and schemes for printers’ type cases in the 19th century show them.</p>
<p>If it’s of interest, here is @ in a specimen of the Miller foundry in Edinburgh dated 1822:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Miller P2 p 1822 with @ - 500_4030.jpg]</p>
<p>Is this a typographical first? Or are there offers of something earlier?</p>
<p>Perhaps Dr Stötzner can tell us. <a href="http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=145">http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=145</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nice topic. The link below has a few more illustrations, including a hand-written one from 1775 and some typographical ones of the early 20th century. Some of the other signs shown are good examples of James' point about the variety of commercial symbols in type.

<p>Wandering off topic here, but I think it&rsquo;s the other way around. I believe Lapi was commenting there on how high the price was of Spanish wine when shipped to the New World.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That’s a great link, and it has badly dented my scepticism. In fact it sent me to the abbreviations at the back of my big dictionary of the Real Academia Español, 14th edition 1914 (didn’t think of looking there), where @ is shown for the arroba.</p>
<p>And that document of 1775, with its well-shaped @s, is impressive. It’s pretty late, though. It would be good to have more and earlier examples, from Italy, Spain, England&hellip;</p>
<p>The examples of typographical @ for arroba given in the link are very English or North American in appearance, as Spanish types in the 19th century often are, so were maybe made for ‘at’ and adopted for the other purpose.</p>
<p>And I’d clearly misread Lapi&hellip;</p>
<p>Well now. What about a typographical @ earlier than 1822?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">While the current [[www.rae.es|DRAE]] has the symbol in its entry for arroba, at least up until mid 1900s I couldn&rsquo;t find an example of its use in the dictionary.  Not to say it wasn&rsquo;t used as an abbreviation before computers, in fact the entry in the DPHD makes it sound like it was used before and then simply &ldquo;popularized&rdquo; because of computers, but in terms of being common enough to make it into the dictionary &hellip; doesn&rsquo;t seem so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am delighted to see Mr. Mosley respond to that. I can not offer a printed sample antedating 1822 (one can hardly beat a St. Bride’s scholar in a matter like this ;-).
As for paleography, surely more investigations into old manuscript archives would have to be undertaken. 1538 is impressively early. The only hint on a possible even earlier usage I found was in a paleographers manual from Portugal (see <a href="http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=143">http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=143</a> ). The indication of “52” at the first @ in this image means “1520 decade”. Unfortunately, no original source is specified in that booklet.</p>
<p>If any further research upon the @ emerges I am prepared to register it under Signographie.de/Focus.</p>
<p>Finally, cheers to Mr. Mosley for the “Dr” Stoetzner, but I have to refuse this honouring unless a kind of “Dr occ[assionis] c[ausa]” may apply ;-) .</p>

<p>An interesting sample! But I would not term it “two different signs”. It’s just <em>three different glyphs</em> and two different uses. (See also the two different glyphs for Pound at the left side.)
And this bobble terminating the tail – punchcutters game, hardly more than that.</p>
<p>However, the actual intersting aspect of this sample is that an upright two-storey (at) occurs in lead type <em>at all</em>.</p>
