  target="_blank">www.romana-hamburg.de</a>. Amazing resource but somewhat chaotic.
  2 questions: <BR> <BR>1. Is this an actual type foundry with typefaces for sale
  or more of an academic compilation of faces? <BR> <BR>2. Are there any other unique
  BlackLetter resources [small foundries, sites] out there that fans of BL faces should
  know about? <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

  body: Its not a foundry - its a painter who sells fonts. I take a closer look into
    the pdf cataloge - and the faces look very well shaped.  <BR> <BR>As you can see
    on the font proofs - he never had a feeling for type! - Do you believe this man
    has all types digitized by himself, drawing by hand?  <BR> <BR>He is not older
    than 40! Over 210 types made round about 11 type faces every year since his 20
    birthday. Unbelievable - an anonymous genius.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/Schriftmappe.zip"

    maybe I`m totally wrong. <BR> <BR>

  body: Vielen Dank Andreas! <BR> <BR>Gerhard Helzel is indeed The Real Thing. As
    far as outline quality goes, Helzel, FVL and Delbanco all have clean, top-notch
    outlines on par with Adobe or Linotype. <BR> <BR>Dieter Steffmann&#39;s outlines
    aren&#39;t quite as accurate, but he disclaims this up front and has a few designs
    unavailable elsewhere, particularly his lovely Wieynck fonts. As free fonts go,
    Steffmann does some decent work in terms of quality. <BR> <BR>The problem with
    many of these German blackletter fonts is the different character encoding standards
    and compromises one has to deal with. Character placement is inconsistent across
    vendors. Linotype, Monotype and Adobe are good about sticking to their Dfr standard,
    but Dfr does not always cover all the ligatures and special characters that some
    of the smaller foundries supply. I hope to make some proposals to remedy this
    eventually... more on that to come. <BR> <BR>I bought a few fonts from FVL in
    the past. Next on my list are several of Helzel&#39;s offerings--he can expect
    a large order from me in the coming weeks.

  body: I have not purchased fonts from Helzel yet. I&#39;m in the middle of moving
    into a new house in a different state right now. Later on I will be able to sit
    down, figure out which ones I must have first, and write an email in German. &#40;It&#39;s
    been too long since I used my German.&#41; <BR> <BR>He added some <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/Neuigkeit.gif">new
    fonts</a> in April and another one yesterday. He now has over 210 for sale.
