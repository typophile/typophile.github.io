  body: "Just for the record this channel doesn't belong to Sky.  The channel More4
    is part of the Channel4 Group (Channel4, E4, Film4, 4Music).  There was also another
    thread regarding channel4's  fonts here - http://typophile.com/node/48991.  It's
    not the same font, but it looks like it's a version of the same one, but alas
    also custom.\r\n\r\nJH"
