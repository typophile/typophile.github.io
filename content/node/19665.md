  body: Patty, if you go to purchase options you'll see that French Script is not
    purchasable from MyFonts. They don't sell most Monotype fonts.

  body: Stephen - I BUY my fonts from Fontshop but for this forum I prefer myfonts
    because of the keyword search. It's also faster to load and cleaner for viewing
    the fonts.

  body: "Keyword Search: Indeed. This makes MyFonts a great resource. We'll be adding
    keyword search in the next update.\r\n\r\nSpeed: Good to know. We're making speed
    a priority in our improvements.\r\n\r\nCleaner: Can you explain? Your input is
    helpful as I know you visit all the resellers."

  body: "Stephen - while your site has a more sophisticated design, there is a lot
    of visual noise, all that yellow and copy boxing everything in. When you look
    at a sample on myfonts it's surrounded by white. Also they don't put those lines
    behind the fonts as often. I understand why they are there - copyright protection
    - but still it makes the font harder to view. So when I'm doing a quick font search
    or just want to look at a sample (unless I have the font and can look at it in
    my font software) I tend to go to myfonts.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps. Like I said,
    I do my shopping at your site.\r\n\r\n(I'll add that one of the things that bugs
    me about myfonts is that when you click on the f ont they take you to the \"font
    sample\" the cascade, rather than the test drive or the character map which would
    be more useful."
