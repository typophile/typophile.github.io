  my typophile hommies might be our best shot at getting this sorted out. Of course,
  no one at our client knows who did the original layouts, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Could be custom handwork as the "N", "o", "d", "e", "&" and "s" don't appear

    considered that they would be hand lettered.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a similar
    font that we can convert the package standard to?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"

  body: I think it IS a font, but it's been distorted via Envelopes or KPT Vector
    Effects, what it actually is though is the challenge...
