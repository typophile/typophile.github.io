  type designers]], and a colleague recently suggested that the artist [[http://www.childsgallery.com/artist.php?artist_id=1580|Bernard
  Brussel-Smith]] designed a typeface, but I've not been able to confirm this. I've
  found [[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&tid=2039175|one US stamp he worked
  on]], and I know he did a great deal of lettering, but I've not been able to find
  reference to his work as a type designer. Is anyone out there able to confirm that
  he was, in fact, a type designer?\r\n\r\nMany thanks. "
