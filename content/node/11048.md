  body: you should almost never use an existing typeface for a trademark. a trademark
    is created for use as a display and there for needs different attention then does
    a typeface. typefaces or &#34;fonts&#34; are meant to be read at small sizes in
    running copy and they are built for this need. when crafting a display face you
    should never use a typeface. not only for the reason above but also because you
    should be making a piece of ownable type for a client, something that is theirs
    and no one else&#39;s. if you use helvetica then the voice of the company is diminished
    by all five million other companies that use helvetica too. if i were a client
    i&#39;d feel ripped off if some amateur designer sold me a typeface i could buy
    myself and use with out their help. i think we as graphic designers and typographers
    need to step up to the plate and start producing real work instead of ripping
    clients off.

    but not extreme.  I think it is fair to say, however, that the average client
    can&#39;t afford a new typeface &#40;font, set of letters&#41;. That is why as
    designers, in situations where the client can&#39;t afford a new set of letters,
    we must know the market and the competition and be able to do as Stephen suggested.

  body: a typeface is a generic term encompassing all type. font is a family of one
    specific typeface. there are countless ways of classifying type. i prefer the
    vox method, but on a very broad level you can make the distinction between display
    face or text face. in the post i made earlier i suggested that a trademark should
    be created with the ideal of display in mind. this is not just a preference but
    a rule. i don&#39;t find this extreme in any way. creating original display type
    can be very easy. it&#39;s not  at all a horrible task, for god sakes we are designers,
    we should enjoy this stuff. over all it&#39;s the distinction between text and
    display that is important. a text face is used for setting copy this is what they
    were built to do. in the days of metal type one face had many different cuts.
    it was different at 10pt then at 32pt. this is because as a type face gets larger
    and becomes a display it needs to become more robust in it&#39;s joins and horizontals.
    making it more of a display face then text face. the fact that the computer makes
    no compensation for this in a typeface as it gets larger is apparent in the fact
    that large computer type looks so bad. no one would dream of setting a book in
    a display face so why should one be as ridiculous to make a trademark out of a
    text face. yet this is done all the time because most designers are lazy or naive.

    <BR> <BR>Indeed. And it&#39;s shocking how many highly-regarded designers don&#39;t

    In the meaning I associate with that term, I&#39;d say the opposite. Display type
    [generally] requires finer detailing, higher contrast, even delicacy and elegance
    on occasion. <BR> <BR>Basically, the difference between the two modes of type
    is parallel to the duality in the reader&#42;: conscious versus subconscious.
    Display type needs to appeal more to aesthetic preferences &#40;which change all
    the time&#41;, while text face needs to appeal more to our reading &#34;firmware&#34;
    &#40;which changes extremely slowly - in fact never over the [adult] life of an
    individual&#41;. Of course nothing exists in a pure state, so even text type needs
    to worry about looks, and display type about basic legibility. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    And many other things, like the duality in the structure of the retina. <BR> <BR>hhp

    the eye and mind deal with it as one word not a collection of words skimmed over

    i agree. but i think you have it mixed up the text face needs legibility as a
    key element [yes] while the display face which relies less on this can change
    all it wants. the more drastic the better because it creates interest on the part
    of the reader. a display situation deals with less type [maybe just one word]
    and so generally less cognition is needed then reading a paragraph of text. because
    of this it can be much more dramatic and illustrative then a text face. this is
    apparent in the fact that most trademarks are heavy and robust examples of display
    typography.'

    and you get a Clarendon-like slab serif! I think what you saying is, text type
    need to accommodate things like ink spread, so details like ink traps at &#39;joins
    and such&#39; have to be considered, am I right? Reading in the traditional sense
    is precisely as you put it - &#39;skimming over and formed together into concepts&#39;.
    We don&#39;t read letter by letter but &#39;word-images&#39;. We take jumps and
    periodically stop at points of fixation, picking up the meaning as we go along.
    <BR> <BR>So, in terms of features, text typefaces are less refined, because they
    are prone to unpredictable reproduction qualities. Besides, we don&#39;t really
    see the details very clearly unless we use a magnifying glass. Display type, on
    the other hand, have to be delicate and a lot more refined, because everything
    is exposed right in front of our eyes to see - there&#39;s nothing to hide. So
    display types are usually have higher contrast, thinner serifs, more refined features
    so we don&#39;t get this chunky slab serif when we blow it up. Think this way
    for a moment: reading text type is like looking at objects at a distance: they
    are less sharp and less defined. Display type, on the other hand, is like looking
    at objects right in front of us, so everything is sharper and more detailed.'

    Yes, in trademarks and billboard kind of display work, the type does need to be
    robust, bold and sturdy. When we&#39;re looking at type that big then we&#39;re
    talking about the same issues as tiny type essentially! Lower contrast, thicker

    the spacing was so wide that the words don&#39;t read as words. Well, apparently
