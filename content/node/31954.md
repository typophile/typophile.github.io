  body: If you mean that you're looking for the font that makes the N and Y in the
    logo above, then I'm pretty sure that you're going to be disappointed; it's almost
    certainly custom hand-lettering. That said, there might be a font reminiscent
    of the N and Y for you to use, although none come immediately to mind right now.

    it was a good decision since this one looks a little goofy in my opinion."
