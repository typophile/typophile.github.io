body: I&#39;m just completing a brand using FF Unit, and I&#39;ve advised my client
  to purchase the font for their own use on letters and other inhouse documentation.
  <BR> <BR>the problem is I&#39;m not 100% sure whether to purchase the fonts as PostScript
  or TrueType. <BR> <BR>So just a couple of questions; <BR> <BR>

  body: If they have up to date hardware and OS&#39;s &#40;Mac OS or Windows&#41;
    then either format should be fine for letters and in-house docs - although I&#39;d
    suggest TrueType to remain consitent with the other fonts the users will be using.
    If they&#39;re running old versions of Windows then they&#39;ll be better off
    with TrueType -  avoiding the need for Adobe Type Manager. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Thanks Si. <BR> <BR>In terms of printing and whatnot are there any differences
    in quality between the 2 formats, or are they exactly the same?

  body: Thomas, I think Si has a point and that it would indeed be relevant and helpful
    &#40;though not, strictly speaking, <i>necessary</i>&#41; for an organisation
    that is not design-centric to have a single font format that they use. <BR> <BR>The
    IT departments of many companies run at any one time a wide range of different
    operating systems, wether PC, Mac or Linux. With that, as you know, there are
    inherent problems to do with compatibility and licensing.  <BR> <BR>For example,
    let us suppose that a department has 23 PCs and 2 Macs. Assuming a font purchase
    is valid for 5 seats, a IT department that decides on Postscript fonts would need
    to buy 6 sets of licenses to cover 25 seats. But if the Macs were running MacOS
    X, which, of course, has the ability to use PC format TT fonts, they&#39;d only
    need 5 sets of licenses, as there would be no &#34;lost&#34; licenses being paid
    for. <BR> <BR>And thats just one example, before we start talking about compatibility
    issues between different versions of the same operating systems, AKA earlier versions
    of Windows and PS fonts. <BR> <BR>Is that not one of the driving forces behind
    OT as a technology? Its not just fancypants typesetting for us type nerds, its
    compatibility and easier deployment for the rest of the world too. <BR> <BR>At
    this moment in time, in non-design environments, TT is a good choice for font
    deployment. But dont worry, we can but hope that OT will take over that mantle
    in time, and then every day will be the first day of spring, and every bird will
    have a new song to sing, etc etc <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'David, <BR> <BR>As long as they&#39;re running the correct operating systems,
    I still think it&#39;s not a big deal at all. However, it&#39;s true that Type
    1 fonts are more complicated from a user perspective, thanks to the multiple files-per-font
    involved. <BR> <BR>For a long-term investment today, Type 1 is probably not the
    best idea, as it is starting to get a little elderly. Either TrueType or OpenType
    &#40;of either flavor&#41; is a better bet. <BR> <BR>On the side, the question
    was not asked about a mixed-platform environment, but just about PCs. Here, your
    example is flawed in a couple of ways. First, it assumes the licenses are platform-specific.
    I&#39;m sure many are, but Adobe&#39;s for one are not, so there would never be
    lost licenses regardless. Second, the Mac users would still be mixing font formats:
    Windows TrueType fonts &#40;or OpenType fonts&#41; are not the same format as
    Mac TrueType fonts. <BR> <BR>If you want to use the same font files on both platforms,
    and you&#39;re using OS X on the Mac, and &#42;only&#42; with native OS X apps,
    then Windows TrueType or TrueType flavored OpenType is a fine option. <BR> <BR>If
    you want to use the same font files on both platforms, and you need them to work
    in Classic or Mac OS 8/9, then you need PostScript flavored OpenType fonts. If
    you&#39;re running an older Windows OS &#40;NT 4, ME or earlier&#41;, then this
    will also mean you need ATM on Windows as well as on the Mac. <BR> <BR>Sigh. It
    does all get rather convoluted. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Hi Tom, <BR> <BR>&#62; Si, why would it be necessary, relevant or even helpful
    to &#34;be consistent&#34; with the format their other fonts are in?  <BR> <BR>For
    this type of user consistency would avoid questions like... <BR> <BR>How do I
    install these Type 1 fonts? <BR>Why do they render differently in my apps? <BR>Why
    won&#39;t they embed in my PowerPoint deck? <BR>Why don&#39;t they work in Visio?
    <BR>How can I use them on my Win 9x machine at home? <BR> <BR>These questions
    are pretty simple to answer, but by sticking with TTF they can be avoided - especially
    in a mid-size company where &#39;tech support&#39; and iota him/herself will have
    to deal with the inquiries. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
