body: Has anyone come across a batch font conversion script for Fontlab? I have about
  200 fonts in pfb/afm format that I need to convert over to a format OS X can handle.

    Set \"Apply action set to\" to \"Fonts in the Fonts List\".\r\n3. Click on \"...\"\r\n4.
    Click on \"+\" and choose all your .pfb fonts. \r\n5. Set \"Destination format\"
    to \"OpenType PS (.otf)\".\r\n6. Choose a destination folder. \r\n7. Click on
    \"OK\", then \"Run\". \r\n\r\nAdam"

    <Fontname> The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not
    sum to the font bbox size!\r\n\r\nIs that a serious problem?"

  body: "James, \r\n\r\nit's not an error, it's a warning. \r\n\r\nIt is not crucial
    -- inconsistent linespacing between Mac and Windows may be a result. However,
    fixing it would require manual editing of the linespacing values (Ascender, Descender).
    \r\n\r\nA."

  body: Err..so is that good or bad? If I only use one platform(MAC) then it's fine
    right?
