  on the word \"THE\" to a script face. I am not all too familiar with using scripts
  in the first place, but pairing one with a condensed sans serif seems, well, impossible.
  Any thoughts or examples would be greatly appreciated, especially in these early
  morning hours.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nB"

  body: THE looks pretty dominant opposed to HIL in your design. Also HIL looks rather
    uninteresting in sans serif caps. The client might just want the actual name HIL
    to be emphasized. Combinations with a script font might require a completely new
    approach.

    body: "thanks for the replies. The client originally\u2014and still to my knowledge\u2014likes
      the sans serif caps. They are going for a \"meat packing district/factory signage\"
      theme. The script addition is what has thrown me off. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
      the type that Mucca used for Pastis http://www.pastisny.com/menus.html or similar.
      The short serifs, condensed feel."

  body: "> meat packing district/factory signage\r\nGotham. Maybe a little overused
    already and of course a completely different thing. As for the font you\u2019re
    looking for; if it\u2019s just about the HIL, you might just draw it yourself.
    It\u2019s only 3 easy glyphs.\r\n"

  body: "This is just an idea, and there's a million different script fonts out there
    to check out (I used <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/ihof/imperialscript.html\">P22's
    Imperial Script</a>). I'm guessing they're looking for a design like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thehil_5258.gif]\r\n\r\nAlso
    be wary of the stair-step effect you get when copy/pasting to create that 3D Block
    Shadow on The Hil. If you aren't aware, check out Leslie Cabarga's \"Logo, Font
    & Lettering Bible\" page 181 will show you how to get rid of that effect. Plus
    he describes how to achieve a plethora of 3D effects."
