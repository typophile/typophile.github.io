  body: "\"room\" is probably customised; they might have started with HOUSE3009-Spaceage-Bold-Alpha
    by House Industries. <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=5&subpage=lettersetter\">Link</a>\r\n\r\nPS.
    Btw, you should have started a new thread for this. "

  body: "Redbeard is right, but it should be noted that <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/odette/\">Odette</a>
    is Canada Type's revival of Benton's 'Announcement Roman', an old metal typeface
    from the early 1900's. Patrick Griffin, of Canada Type, has been doing a great
    job of bringing back old typefaces, and I like that he credits his sources.\r\n\r\n-
