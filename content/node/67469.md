body: "A co-worker of mine is getting a tattoo this week. Her name is \"Tiffany\"
  and she's looking to get just the world \"beautiful\" on her arm. She's really liking
  the absence of style that Helvetica provides. However, she'd really like to style
  the \"tif\" part in the word a bit different as it's part of her name.\r\n\r\nWe
  played around with a few ideas, such as making it light, but nothing really felt
  right because it sits in the middle of the word and seems to break up the consistency
  that Helvetica provides in the first place.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any good recommendations
  on how to style that part of the word different in such a way that still looks great?
  Or maybe any examples of signs/posters where they've done something similar that
  has looked great?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beautiful_6486.png]"

  body: Color is the best suggestion to maintain the integrity and cleanness of helvetica
    and still accomplish what you want.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tif_4728.jpg]\r\n\r\ni don't like so
    much color tattoos, especially in this case: in the middle of the word, any other
    color (e.g. red) in my opinion breaks the optical weight of the word making it
    seems two words spaced. i like underlines and in my opinion in this case this
    works well, it retains the absence of style (as you said, even if i think there's
    more style here than in many other tattoos) you loved."

  body: I think it might work if you take the bottom of "tif" and pull it down to
    descender length.

    you could use something a little prettier for the cursive part, but you get the
    idea.\r\n(sorry for the link, i don't know how to post images yet)"

  body: how about putting a tail on the f that mirrors the bottom of the t?  This
    would give the tif part a symmetry that might be enough to set it apart from the
    rest of the word without breaking it up too much.
