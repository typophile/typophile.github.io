  body: If you want to do it in Fontlab, you'll need to have a typeface with underlines
    built in. In InDesign you can apply character styles with a underline, defining
    its offset, stroke weight, colour etc. For the gaps you just omit the style for
    that specific character. You can also play with adding a thin white stroke to
    the font to make gaps.

  body: "Why not using GREP styles in Indesign?\r\n\r\n1. Set up a Paragraph style
    for your text.\r\n2. Create a new character style for the underlining.\r\n3. In
    your paragraph style add a nested style and call the created character style.\r\n4.
    Click on GREP style in your paragraph style and add a new GREP style.\r\n5. Enter
    the character you want to change (p or g etc).\r\n6. Where it says Apply Style
    create a new character style with underline turned off (or stroke around text).\r\n7.
    Apply paragraph style to text.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there is an easier way, but can't
    think of anything else without testing it.\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg\r\n"

  body: "Eike Dingler has implemented an interesting underlining feature in his type]media
    graduation typeface \u2018Mexa\u2019, using stylistic sets. Unfortunately, no
    images of this can be found online, but I guess you can just get in touch with
    him.\r\n\r\nThe underline values to be set in FontLab only control how the underline
    looks in word processing applications like MS Word (possibly also TextEdit etc).
    InDesign allows much finer-tuned control, as illustrated above."

    interested in this thread because some scripts (like Armenian) have a much more
    serious problem than Latin in terms of underlining destroying legibility.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
