body: "My brother in-law has asked me to design a logo for his business and since
  this is the first time I have attempted to design a logo from scratch I was wondering
  if anyone could give me a few ideas. I realize that most of you do this for a living
  so I would not want you to spend too much time with me, all I need are a few ideas
  to get me going in the right direction. I am comfortable using Illustrator and Photoshop.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a little background. My brother in-law breads and races pigeons in Tucson, AZ.
  \  The name of his business is DESERT VIEW LOFT http://www.desertviewlofts-tucson.com
  \ He needs a logo that will work on everything from biz cards to T-shirts.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated. Once I have a few working logos I'll post them
  for review.\r\n\r\n-Steve"

  body: "The visual of pigeons nested/taking flight from the counter forms in the
    letters of 'Desert View Lofts', which should probably be stacked to prevent it
    from getting too long ('Desert' on top of 'View Lofts'). The 'D' and the 'O' are
    particularly good spots for this.\r\n\r\nDo not use Photoshop for creating logos
    (except to save them for the web, etc.). Use Illustrator's vectors to create a
    logo that can scale to any size without resolution loss. It also tends to force
    you to keep your illustration cleaner and simpler."
