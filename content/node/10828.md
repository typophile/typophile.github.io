body: I have been seeing MacSans/Bodega being used on everything! From the Oscars
  to food packaging to Wal-mart. Does anyone have any insight to it&#39;s over-use
  &#40;or abuse&#41; as of late?!? I literally cannot go a day without seing it on
  packages from the snack machine or used in tv ads. Please let me know if I am the
  only one who sees this or has some thoughts about why it has spread everywhere like
  a virus?

  body: I need to also mention that this fanot could also rear it&#39;sugly head as
    TRG Casablaca as well. Which is slightly different but overused as well.
