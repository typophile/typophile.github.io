<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Why is it nowadays there is no careful crafting of type for much-exposed titling for things like movies? For example the highly-acclaimed "There Will Be Blood" uses a typeface that is repeated yet its supposed to look gothic and somewhat grunged? Take a look at the example, with the tile, and see the "l"'s and the capitol "B"'s and "o"'s are the same, just like when you type them out on your computer. Wouldn’t you think the designers would take the time to build variation from repeated letter-to-letter? I know most consumers wont notice, but it bugs me to bloody hell why they cant stop being lazy and add some variation to make it custom. I see this more and more, and worry its the new age of laziness. What are your thoughts on this?

With more exposure this will become a great marketing tool for OpenType.
PS. I find the letter-spaced Daniel-Day-Sheep-Shagger more disturbing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This was discussed a bit here:
http://www.typophile.com/node/42493
I giggle at the typeface name "Kraut-type-a-fuck"
I agree, for a free font, you think they could have at least spent 5 minutes tweaking the title so it wasn't so obviously 'computer made' when they were truly going after an organic look.
Fontplayer, in the previous thread, pointed out that the typeface was free for personal use only. I too am curious as to whether or not a legitimate license was purchased.

<div class=commentbody>Sii, I agree, the other type is disturbing as well. Since when is it a good idea to mix all those differnt fonts in the way that they have, and having more than one Gothic font to clash with each other? Makes my eyes bleed.
Aluminum, thanks for the note on the other thread. I figured someone had to bring this up, and so I did a Search to make sure, and it didnt come up. That Search function here is limited, at best. And yes, they were trying for an orgainic look, yet to our eyes, its anything but. I guess what gets me so riled up is that the mood of the poster is there, and has SO MUCH potential to make it a real work of art, yet they totally fudged it somehow, so it feels so wasted.</div>

<div class=commentbody>My question is why should they care. Most movie audiences don't care about type or how its presented. Its about getting out there. they would have the same sales if they used any other typeface. The marketing is more important than the design, sorry but true.</div>

<div class=commentbody>">>why should they care ?"
It depends on who 'they' is and where the whole titles role comes into play.
Filmmaking, is an art, so one would hope the 'artists' would have some interest in maintaining integrity throughout the entire presentation.
But, the 'art' is often handed off to the studio, and, yea, all they care is that we buy $14 tickets and $5 sodas.
BUT...given that this was P.T. Anderson one would have hoped/thought that this would have been a concern.
And, seriously, Typophile censors naughty words? ;o)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree whole heartedly. Last year I did a project for a camp in Nebraska where they wanted something that looked distressed. They sent me something from 1001uglyfonts.net and suggested I use it. No thanks.
I ended up hand distressing each letter in illustrator. I'm sure none of the high school kids cared, but I did.

<div class=commentbody>"Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson have made a new movie called There Will Be Blood, based on the Upton Sinclair novel, Oil. After seeing a special edition of Moby Dick, made by Arion Press, they called the San Francisco publisher of fine art edition books to make the title sequence for the film. Kenny Howard responded."

<div class=commentbody>Either it is Hollywood shenanigans where you hire 20 people to do the same job, pay them all, then let an adolescent chimp choose the final; or it is some web version of <cite>F is for Fake</cite>. Arion looks like the real deal so I’ll bet on the adolescent chimp.

Looks as though someone thought the freeware design looked oilier, or the titles use a different face from the poster copy.</div>
