body: "So here's the situation. I have a client who needs the Keynote (Mac) files
  I've created converted to PowerPoint (PC). Exporting to PowerPoint and opening them
  I notice only most of the fonts are still as they should be. So I figure I can change
  those few, no big deal. (I mean who really expects Keynote and PowerPoint to play
  nicely?) But, the biggest problem and almost total failure happens when I send them
  these PowerPoint files. If you look at this image you'll see that almost none of
  the fonts remain. I'm in touch with someone at Adobe and they tell me it is a problem
  with out the separate OS map fonts. So, I'm wondering if any of you have had the
  problem and if there is a slicker way to solve it. And I have to send them PowerPoint
  so maybe we're out of luck?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font-Test_5455.png]"

  body: "To get it work, on the Mac side you need to select the base font of a style-linked
    group, and then click on the Bold and Italic buttons. For example, to get the
    Semibold you'll need to select the Light, and then press the Bold button. This
    will get you the Semibold working cross-platform.\r\n\r\nFor Myriad Pro, [[http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/html/readmes/MyriadProReadMe.html#A2|refer

    why didn't you tell me this earlier? ;^) Thank you I will try that out.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Errr, I don't use Windows, so I tend to forget its oddities. In any case,
    keep in mind that this works if you create a PPT file on the Mac and open it on
    Windows. But you're getting the PPT files on Mac by converting from Keynote. So
    it's likely that a few (many) things will fail.

    helps me connect with the "dark" side. :^)
