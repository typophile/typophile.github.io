body: This is the second of two posters I made for my language arts teacher who is
  leaving at the end of this year. It's supposed to be a weeping willow, the whole
  tree idea was based on the tree of knowledge and such, One of my other ideas was
  an apple but I ended up not going for that. as always let me know what you think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1-2_3559.png]

  body: "Hey, I have seen few of your other posters here and you really have some
    nice ideas going on there. But I have noticed one thing that you always use Helvetica
    in your work by default. Any specific reason? Well, am not saying there is anyting
    wrong in using Helvetica but somehow it makes all your stuff look alike. \r\n\r\nHelvetica
    has a super strong identity and when someone use it in the excess amount, that
    becomes more of a Helvetica promotional material.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, keep the
    good work up."
