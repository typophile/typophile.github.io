  have a [[http://www.radballsthegame.com|Radballs]] meets the Swiss Typography kinda
  feel. I am really enjoying Sinaloa's funky geometry but am struggling to find a
  suitable family for the body copy. Suggestions?"

      to check back here for replies!\r\nInteresting discussion, however.\r\nI hadn't
      checked around for it. I will admit to taking a gander at places like fontspace.com
      and 1001freefonts.com, which I may have picked up Sinaloa at some point(it was
      sitting in my Font folder). I am curious if sites like those are perceived as
      unethical hotbeds used by unethical users. I find the occasional gem there,
      but never thought to find out if what I was looking at was a rip-off or simply
      poor licensing protection."

  body: "hrant,\r\n\r\nI don't get it. MyFonts says Sinaloa is designed in 1974, debut
    in MyFont in 2000, and costs $26. It seems to predate P22 Bifur Set a lot.\r\n"

  body: "Wow.\r\nHere's what happened: since Daniel didn't provide a link I typed
    \"Sinaloa font\" into Google, and got a full page of sites offering it for free.
    I didn't bother checking MyFonts since it's rare for the cloners not to even change
    the name... :-/  Whoever owns Sinaloa sure isn't doing a good job protecting it.
    So I was right that the free one is illegitimate - but Daniel could've been talking
    about the commercial original. On the  other hand since he never corrected me
    I have a feeling he saved that $26.  :-/\r\n\r\nAs for Bifur: there I was saying
    that Sinaloa feels inspired by Bifur (which is from the 1920s) and it might be
    worth considering a \"purer\" original.\r\n\r\nYou know what's sad BTW? Nobody
    besides me -not even people I'm <em>dead sure</em> knew that Sinaloa has both
    a legit and a clone version, under the same name- said a word about this.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "That\u2019s news to me, I just remember it from Letraset days.\r\nSinaloa
    always struck me as being a kind of Baby Teeth with Stripes design, rather than
    letters composed of bifur-cated parts on the same plane. Anyway, I tend to be
    a bit of an historical purist, and like to match faces from the same era, hence
    the AG suggestion."
