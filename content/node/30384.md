  body: depends on the scope of the book/magazine. are you speaking in general? or
    do you have specific project in mind?

  body: Some might say that Scala is good for book and/or magazine work because it
    has good body weight and x-height, as well as low-contrast.

  body: "Speaking in general or something that worked for you and the client.\r\nI'm
    a bit obsessed with typefaces, no really obsessed like an addiction to certain
    drug substance. I always go a full circle in a fontbook and end up using Scala
    again just wasted lots and lots of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed <strong>Miss Tiffany</strong>
    Scala does."

  body: "If you like Scala, try perhaps Nexus, Seria, Dante, PMN Caecilia, TheSerif.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to branch out, there are a gazillion fonts that work beautifully for
    body text, too many to list here. Depends on the job. "

  body: "One of my magazines is is Optima - it gets more letters per line and is readable...\r\nworks
    well with automobiles...\r\n\r\nanother one has all editorial in Avant Garde...\r\n\r\nI
    guess I prefer the clean look of san serif for magazine layout.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are going for book layout - I'd stick with the serif faces... easier for the average
    Joe to read. I can remember Baen Books searching for the perfect font - they decided
    it was the exclusive NY Times body copy font... so they settled for Caledo --
    Alphatype's version of Caledonia.\r\n\r\nBest of luck - and let's see some of
    the layout in the future."

  body: Generally my font selections for a particular book are relegated by a required
    character per pica due to some page count issue. When given carte blanche I tend
    to ponder and drool like a kid at Baskin Robbins, and generally (eventually) settle
    on chocolate I mean, an old favorite like ITC Garamond, Caslon, Monotype Janson
    or (especially) ITC Bembo. Sometimes I get wild and specify Electra. If I do acquire
    a new favorite, I tend to use it until I burn myself and everyone in the studio
    out on it.
