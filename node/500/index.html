He was the guy in charge of the project (along with Sue Kaplan). Lange does design type, but that wasn't his involvement in that project - he was the typographer. Along with Carter they arrived at the choice of Manutius because that's what their collective typographic expertise told them. They spent a small fortune on just the font. They didn't choose it because it came after Mandrill in their font menu. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, I think for Don's project a old Italian face would probably be best.

The original breathes of that same confidence and disipline and panache as the renaissance thinkers, including Machiavelli. It is not just a question of using something of the same period. It is another example of renaissance brilliance, matched to Machiavelli himself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now which Jenson best suits your project is a more difficult question. None of course capture exactly the spirit of the original. Actually the italic of Abobe Jenson might work as James suggests. And the Open type does have both the archic long 's' roman (that looks like and 'f') and italic (like the integral sign). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would also look at Hightower and Italian Oldstyle at least.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks so much for all of the informative posts! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've got plenty of choices to mull over at this point, though I'm leaning in the direction of Adobe Jenson, perhaps in the style that James suggests. William's eloquence in praise of Jenson is also very persuasive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve, one thing about using a modern typeface: due to the unique nature of the medium, in which type is superimposed or woven into the images, it would look somewhat jarring (IMO) for a modern typeface to be juxtaposed with images of Renaissance Florence. The comics medium is what demands of me an approach to text which complements my approach to imagery.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I refuse to use the common &quot;comics&quot; fonts in this piece, as those emerged as the type of choice for children's adventure comics, and are more appropriate for that genre. (That style of writing in comics has become ubiquitous as the superhero genre became so dominant that few questioned treating text in comics any other way&ndash;but that's another hobby horse and perhaps not germane to this forum) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're interested in what the hell I'm talking about, you can view the prologue to Machiavelli &lt;a href=&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/machframe.html">http://www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/machframe.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

First, this is first and foremost a catalog of bibliographic descriptions. It is secondarily a book about Aldus. A typeface was needed, any typeface, that had a workable Greek, Latin, roman. By workable I mean we would need &quot;on a discovery&quot; basis, &quot;every&quot; G/L/r letterform that existed as incunabular (including those that no longer exist) as well as any G/L/r letterform that was currently of use in the twentieth century. Matthew was our only choice. Not only as a designer but as a knowledgable historian of type. At the time there was no italic for the Miller and that would have to be developed as well. &quot;He&quot; named the face Manutius in honor of the project and for no other reason. This particular configuration of the Miller/Wilson face no longer exists as it was developed solely for use in this project. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've found that bibliographic descriptions, dictionaries, etc, go a bit beyond their subject matter and are bibliographically considered a subject in themselves. They are certainly categorized that way in every library system that I know of.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RB, as I recall from an email he sent to me, was a bit more emotional about this than he now claims. He also felt my use of Miller for a faux nineteenth-century book about Gutenberg was wrong as obviously anything about Gutenberg should be set in a blackletter. His latching on to subject matter prevented him from seeing the structure that existed beyond the subject matter, a nineteenth century interpretation, a bibliographic description catalog. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No incunabular or Renaissance form can adequately provide the legibility/readability needs that would be required in printed matter where such concerns are paramount. Early forms that existed before these historical concerns raised their ugly little heads are often inadequate. Every interpretation of these early forms runs into this problem.</div>

It <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> an amazing deal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It looks like my type decisions are going to work out as follows: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Handwritten script based on Machiavelli's handwriting for diary entries or letters. This is the treatment that I used in the prologue, when Machiavelli descibes the Pazzi conspiracy in a manuscript. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Adobe Jenson italic for excerpts from published works and captions that are not written by Machiavelli <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) A handwritten Jenson Italic for dialogue. I've chosen this approach because of the inappropriateness of traditional comic fonts for this project, and the fact that it will make for easier reading than a script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the market, there is a small market for art/alternative comics: books like Maus, Jimmy Corrigan, From Hell, Safe Area Gorazde. This book is unlike those in execution, but similar in aims: to use comics as a medium to tell a complex story with a desire to be artistically innovative as well.
