  a search in the forums for typefaces used on WIRED magazine. From searching, I've
  concluded that the masthead is a custom typeface by Hoefler & Frere-Jones. (Correct
  me if I'm wrong please.) However, it seems WIRED changes their cover typefaces every
  issue.\r\n\r\nI think that this issue has used two different typefaces for the Jan.
  2013 cover - a serif and san-serif. I've used identifont.com and whatthefont.com
  and haven't had any luck. Hoping someone has an idea. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCynthia"

  body: "Technically, the magazine title, \"WIRED\" isn't called the masthead, but
    the nameplate. The masthead is the list of owners, staff, departments, addressed,
    etc. found on the inside. However, the term 'masthead' has been misused often
    enough that some dictionaries now include that title page definition.\r\n- Herb"

    a little more digging, I'm almost certain the san-serifs is Peri\xF3dico by Emtype."
