  body: "Probably not for sale to the public, if it is actually a font and not just
    lettering. Used in Shana Galen's Jewels of the Ton romance series. Three so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhenYouGiveADukeADiamond_5503.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IfYouGiveARakeARuby_4215.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SapphiresAreAEarlsBestFriend_6534.jpg]\r\nThe
    terminals are sometimes called foxtails and are found in fonts such as Droid Serif
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/droid-serif-pro/.\r\nNote the variation
    in some of the letters from book to book.\r\nThe wavy cross bar on the E and H
    is usually called a tilde and is found in various fonts as discussed in http://typophile.com/node/110669\r\nDon"

  body: Hi, Don-- Thanks for taking the time to respond.  Shana is my client.  She's
    asked the publisher for the font name (that was our first stop),  but hasn't heard
    back so I was trying to find the font name (or something closer) so I could get
    some materials created for her sooner vs. later.  If anyone else has ideas of
    something closer than what I've come up with (Garton), I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

  body: "You're welcome Laron. It's unfortunate that Shana's publisher is not being
    responsive. It seems to me that although the three covers show some variation
    in letter-forms they provide enough information to make a font. You can find many
    suggestions as to how to make swashed letters appropriate to this style in Mark
    Simonson's Bookmania http://www.identifont.com/show?2I31 and Laura Worthington's
    Samantha Upright http://www.identifont.com/show?2GDC, both of which offer many
    alternates.\r\nDon"
