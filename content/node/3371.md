  body: This &#34;scrapbooking&#34; thing is a growing hobby in certain circles. I
    have a feeling Martha Stewart may have something to do with it. There are magazines,
    <a href="http://www.scrapbook.com/" target="_blank">websites</a>, etc. A rather
    slick little store called Archivers opened nearby recently. It&#39;s so busy that
    customers of nearby stores have a hard time finding parking spots.

    popular when my daughters were in junior high school 10 years ago.  <BR> <BR>Like
    Tiffany&#39;s friend, I&#39;m surprised fonts are being used. It&#39;s more common
    to use stickers based on themes &#40;Halloween, My 18th Birthday, etc.&#41;. Font
    designers who are worried might also need to check out the sticker collections
    to be sure the manufacturer has properly licensed their fonts.  <BR> <BR> <BR>

    scrapbook because of all the books I buy. Hehe.

  body: This is a sticky wicket. The product they are selling lets users punch out
    letters. It doesn&#39;t wash with most font licenses, &#40;at least mine&#41;.
    In this case, Quikutz has to reproduce the letterforms to create the tool, and
    make minute adjustments to create the &#34;die&#34; that punches the letter.  <BR>

  body: Typespotting at a craft store is amusing &#40;well, possibly&#41;.  Besides
    the scrapbooking section, there are rubber stamps, wall stencils, etc.  You can
    play spot-the-Lithos-knockoff or wonder why letters with dots at the terminals
    are popular so long after Tekton&#39;s heyday.  I&#39;ve often wondered if any
    of these products were from licensed designs.  &#40;Any success stories?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having difficulty understanding how a EULA would prevent someone
    from, say, collecting all the nearby lost cat posters to obtain Comic Sans in
    A-Z, then creating the scrapbooking dies from those.  What am I missing?

    as long as somebody purchases the the proper license for the number of CPUs/devices/whatever,
    I don&#39;t care how extensively they use it. In fact, I hope they use it as much
    as possible and as <i>visibly</i> as possible because in my experience there is
    a direct relationship between how often people see a font and how well it sells.
