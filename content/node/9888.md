  body: 'Peter, you already know about Alistair Johnston&#39;s book I suspect: &#34;Alphabets
    to Order. Literature of Nineteenth-Century Typefounders&#39; Specimens&#34;. In
    addition there&#39;s a cool old article that might help: &#34;Advertising for
    a Type Foundry&#34; by J J de L Meyer, in the Penrose Annual 1968 &#40;pp 198-208&#41;.
    It has some pretty cool and unique examples &#40;like type on a pear&#41;. Let
    me know if you&#39;d like a copy &#40;although my own copy isn&#39;t so hot&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>My own font specimens suck, but I&#39;ve collected a ton of stuff from
    other foundries. I&#39;ve divided them into three groups: regular &#40;90% of
    my collection&#41;, third-party &#40;stuff done by users&#41;, and &#34;pinnacle&#34;
    &#40;the best of the best&#41;. If it might help you to know the members of the
    third group, let me know. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'I don&#39;t have the Johnston book. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll snailmail you a copy
    of the de L Meyer article if you remind me of your ground address. <BR> <BR>To
    me the best specimen book in history is the 1908 Enschede. The 1978 is great too
    - just not sublime like the 1908 is. You might consider a sidebar article on it/them.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I got a request for the contents of my &#34;pinnacle&#34;
    group, but I figured to just put it up here too, so here it is, in no particular
    order: <BR> <BR>- The 1908 Enschede <BR>- Gentium booklet &#40;V Gaultney&#41;
    <BR>- The Centaur Types &#40;B Rogers&#41; <BR>- Lexicon booklet &#40;B de Does&#41;
    <BR>- Johnston Sans &#40;ITC&#41; <BR>- Tact in Typographical Design [Octavian]
    &#40;S Morison&#41; <BR>- Ex Ponto &#40;Adobe&#41; <BR>- Sabon Next &#40;Linotype&#41;
    <BR>- She&#39;s the Best of the Mall &#40;Veer&#41; <BR>- Newspaper Type &#40;Font
