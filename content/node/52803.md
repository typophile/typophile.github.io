  Zocalo Display for\u2014well\u2014display, then Bohemia for text. I think we have
  a winning combination.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPS... I would be nice if they integrated
  the small caps into the roman for extra opentype goopy-goodness. And when is FB
  ever gonna add an fj ligature to the their repertoire?\r\n\r\nKudos nonetheless
  to the FB team and Cyrus!\r\n"

    Reminds me of bent up wrought iron\u2014even Mexican handicrafts.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some details that I see a publisher might find off-putting like the deep cuts
    into the left side of the v and w. My eye wants to complete that space. For some
    it might outright register as an error.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZocaloV_4092.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZocaloW_3750.png]\r\n\r\nCyrus
    Highsmith made it kind of squat like ionic too (a quality I like). \r\n\r\nSo
    really, what don\u2019t you like about it Murray?\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
