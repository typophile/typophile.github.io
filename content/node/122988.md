  body: "This lettering is a pastiche of styles. Note for example the median spurs
    -- found in many wild west fonts --and the foxtail terminals There are some fonts
    that catch some of the flavor of the lettering.\r\nAn interesting substitute is
    Jonathan Barnbrook's Mason http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=104 and\r\nOthers
    include Midnight-Show https://creativemarket.com/Alterdecofont/15306-Midnight-Show-typeface
    Exocet by Jonathan Barnbrook http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=95 and the Dogma
    movie font, a fan effort as Avqest http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest.  Jeremy
    Dooley's Newcomen\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/newcomen/\r\nDon"
