  Clearly legibility and readability are paramount, but as a membership magazine we
  want to attract and engage readers, so character and aesthetic is just as important.
  I think a sans, given competitive media is going to be the main body and headline
  face, but I would like a serif or perhaps a slab serif to complement and add texture.
  \r\n\r\nI'm literally just starting so would welcome any ideas as to any  families
  which have both slab and supporting sans which might work for this type of title?\r\n\r\nIt
  doesn't need to be cutting edge but contemporary and versatile - also not too expensive
  (i.e. no H&F fonts!)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
