  body: "All you do here is ask for IDs, and now you want to steal?\r\nLeave.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI
    was going to link to this from my \"IDs = Cha-Ching\" thread, but that thread
    seems to have been removed...\r\n\r\nOthers have said that many (probably most)
    ID requests are motivated by a desire to pirate the font in question. Which means
    Typophile ends up hurting its best demographic. Charging a nomimal amount for
    IDs would stop the practice 99%.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPlease don't remove this thread
    so I can point to it every time this guy asks for an ID.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
