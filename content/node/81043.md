  Terminal Rotterdam\". I found it on the website, but is actually used on the building
  itself, too. \r\n\r\nLook at this picture too: [http://www.restaurants010.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cafe_rotterdam.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  have no clue about the age of the font.\r\n\r\nHope you can help me!"

    but there may be digital versions. I will look into this.

    Machteld den Hertog, see the link below.\r\n\r\nhttp://home.planet.nl/~voogt053/Rotterdam.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    too would love to find out who made the custom font of the Cruise Terminal. Some
    years ago I tried to get in contact with the terminal but they do not respond
    to my e-mails. Maybe if you try you will be more successful... \r\n"
