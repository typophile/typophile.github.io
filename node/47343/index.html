  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I came across this site by pure accident this morning while scouring the net for some inspiration for logo/font design.  I am completely new to typography so please bear with me!  I manage a new and up coming film director and what I am looking for is some help with a design and some ideas of what fonts we could use for his logo.</p>
<p>We have decided to go for a logo is the style of art deco as it is a style that seems quite synonymous with the film industry.  However we are open to other ideas that might suit a logo for this purpose. We are looking for something that encompasses clean and simple, but classic  with an edge if that is possible!  I  have approached a couple of companies and so far the results have not been too good.  I have either had designs that are  bland and boring- or ones that look like they have been nabbed from an old clip art album.  First impressions are important and so we need this to be good- hence why I am out scouring for some ideas so that we get what we want!.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. I look forward to your ideas!</p>
<p>Neha</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re soliciting spec work, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the results have been unsatisfactory.  You get what you pay for.</p>
<p>You should find a few local design firms whose portfolios you like.  Ask them to bid on your project and for your sake, be more specific in your brief.  The description &ldquo;clean and simple, modern/contemporary style, but classic with an edge&rdquo; is internally inconsistent and frankly impossible to work with.  You shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily go for the lowest bidder.  Finally, work with them and trust them.</p>
<p>I wish you luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah Neha, Red is correct. Spec work is frowned on in this industry and considered to be [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work|unethical.]]</p>
<p>A logo is not a font (but sometimes can be with altered letter-spacing etc). So looking for a font for a logo will not make the logo - the designer makes the logo. A similar analogy would be to assume that by buying an excellent 35mm motion camera you can make a great movie&hellip;</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>A resource like [[www.dandad.org|D&amp;AD]] in the UK should be able to help find a designer.</p>
