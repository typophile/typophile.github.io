  body: Ale - This is your finest and most mature work yet.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m impressed
    that you&#39;ve managed to work decent-sized <BR>accents into a face with a pretty
    large x-height, although it  <BR>could be a problem at smaller sizes &#40;hard
    to tell on-screen  <BR>what 9 pt. would look like&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I also dig the
    alt characters, but I don&#39;t quite buy the &#39;e&#39;  <BR>for the roman yet.
    Needs more balance somehow.  <BR> <BR>The stroke contrast is nice. Overall, it&#39;s
    a clean sans with  <BR>the organic feel of the pen. Very lovely.  <BR> <BR>I like
    the italic best - let&#39;s see more of it. <BR> <BR>P.S. Very sneaky with the  <BR>propaganda-laced
    specimen  <BR>text. I&#39;m with you.

  body: I just want to point out that there is already a typeface out there called
    &#34;Latina&#34; &#40;both serif and sans&#41; by I&ntilde;igo Jerez Quintana.
    It was included in ATypI&#39;s <I>Bukva:raz</I> competition. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: ' Thanks guys for the comments. I will try to work the e and complete the
    italics but I really want to finish the regular at first. <BR>The alt e, g and
    a are included in the regular but because it was a start for the furure italic.
    <BR>&#40;I dont know if its the right way but its my process&#41; I think that
    italic its more practical to design after have all the roman glyph completed.
    &#40;sorry my poor english&#41; <BR> <BR>Ken: was a font called Latina one of
    the winners of the contest? and..there are not a House Industries font called
    Latina too? &#40;I cant remember now&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway Latina could be changed
    and.. what is the name you imagine for this font? &#40;not only a question for

    ALT=":&#41;">  I think the acute accent on the o needs to be moved to the right
    a bit.  It looks like it&#39;s geometrically centered, but it needs to be optically
    centered. <BR> <BR>Paul '

  body: I don&#39;t think there were any &#34;winners&#34; in the <I>Bukva:raz</I>
    competition; you were either in or out. The House Industries product is known
    as the &#34;Latino Collection&#34; &#40;masc. not fem.&#41; but neither of the
    two fonts is actually called Latino. They&#39;re Samba and Rumba. <BR> <BR>--

  body: ' Yes Ken you are right, I remeber now that it was a HI collection and not
    a font. <BR> <BR>I didnt see around the Latina font you mentioned so its hard
    to imagine what names are taken. <BR> <BR>I remeber that House Ind called Global
    a font and its was use by Garage and T26. They should turn it to Bullet. And Garage
    to New Global. <BR> <BR>Anyway a more critical analysis from you maybe I expected.
    <BR> <BR>Sorry for my english and good weekend. <BR> <BR>PS. Why americans and
    europeans asociate Latino with hot and excite? Argentinians are different than
    chilenos, peruanos, uruguayos? I think the hot latinoamericans are only the brazilians
    and the caribeans...just a doubt '
