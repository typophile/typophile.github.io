  body: "The 'f' looks like the function symbol in the Roman font of a serif family.
    In some fonts this seems to be the same as an italic 'f', but I'm not sure that's
    what they all use. I thought the 'p' counter didn't match any Baskerville I saw,
    but I was having a hard time finding anything especially close. At first I thought
    it could be Times, but when you look at them in large sizes the serifs are not
    the same. I am beginning to think the serifs were altered to make them more pointed,
    but I think that 'f' looks familiar, and may be the key to finding what was the
    starting point for this logo. Confirmation would be from the 'p' counter shape
    and the triangular top of the 't'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Antonio, I think you found the right family. It still does look to me that
    the serifs were made longer and the 'ft' crossbar seems thinner than those in
    the font, but the 'f' is certainly the right shape and the 'p' counter looks right.\r\n\r\nI
    think that's where this logo started.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
