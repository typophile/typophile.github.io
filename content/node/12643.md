    elements. This includes logos for our new product versions: http://www.pejot.com/logo/
    and some product illustrations: http://www.pejot.com/ilustracje/\r\n\r\nThe new
    FontLab Studio icon will be included in FontLab Studio 5, of course :) \r\n\r\nRegards,

    a post in there, if you edit it.\r\n\r\nWhat I said was: \r\n\r\nRamiro I think
    you are referring to <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/4820.html?1045092418\">this
    thread</a>.\r\n\r\nHowever, it looks like the FontLab guys have found a brilliant
    artist for the forthcoming icons."

  body: "Very nice.\r\n\r\nIt does bother me that the spline control points in the
    <em>FontLab Studio</em> icon are wrong. I think those could be fixed without detracting
    too much from the design of the icon.\r\n\r\nIt's also a little disconcerting
    to see that the split-up pieces of the <em>BitFonter</em> logo contain partial
    pixels of the <em>B</em> glyph. The pieces should be split on exact pixel boundaries.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I'm confused as to the purpose of the <em>r</em> that exists in the negative space
    of the <em>TransType</em> logo. It seems to just clutter up the logo -- probably
    more so in the smaller versions of the icon, such as the Windows-typical 32&times;32.
    It also doesn't work at all with the upside-down <em>T</em>. I'd probably keep
    the two <em>T</em>s and eliminate the <em>r</em> entirely."

    somewhere. ;^D"
