  the other day and then -- whoops -- it looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-be/light/?refby=typographica\">some
  versions of Akzidenz Grotesk</a> have a kerned '7' when I assume they meant the
  figures to be tabular. At least I think that's what went wrong. Any other theories?"

    Grotesk BE</a>, has this problem, the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/\">BQ
    version</a> seems to have perfect tabular figures. As I don't have the fonts,
    I can't confirm other than what I see in MyFonts.\r\n\r\nSo I guess that Berthold
    recognised the error and corrected it? "

  body: It's also interesting that when you go to the BE page and the BQ page and
    type in "7," into the sample text area, and then move your cursor over the image,
    in the BE sample text, the alt tag "Preview Image (kerned)" shows up. In the BE
    page, only "Preview Image" shows up.

  body: "Sorry to be dumb about it, but hasn't the \"BE\" (read: Adobe) versions of
    Berthold's fonts been off the market for quite some time?\r\n\r\nMany of those
    BE fonts were the only really good thing I found about buying Adobe Illustrator
    4.0 back in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\nI would agree the column spacing of those
    numerals appears odd. But being a sign designer I usually have to respace numerals
    out of that anyway. Phone numbers and numerical addresses on signs are so extremely
    useless...."

    <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/info/FAQ.html#6\">FAQ</a> basically states
    that BE versions are dumbened down BQ fonts with the same outlines but different
    metrics and kerning, less language support and incomplete character sets.\r\n\r\nThe
    drop in quality is intentional so it seems. Utterly pointless as both font packages
    are sold at the same price point."
