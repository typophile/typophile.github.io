  for an eight year-old who loves drawing lettering. He is mainly into skate and comic
  styles, and also likes copying film and TV logos. Both his parents are artists and
  their home is full of great art books so something big that obviously isn't aimed
  at children would not daunt him if there was enough pictures.\r\n\r\nIn terms of
  reference material some things I am thinking of are:\r\n\r\nBooks of skateboard
  graphics.\r\n\r\nComics or graphic novels with particularly interesting intricate
  lettering but preferably with not too complicated story lines. I'm thinking possibly
  Will Eisner for those fantastic 3D logos in The Spirit. Also the recent reprints
  of Krazy Kat with the lovely Chris Ware covers. Sadly the modern editions of Asterix
  and Tintin he has seem to have replaced a lot of the original hand lettering with
  digital.\r\n\r\nAll suggestions welcomed."

    of lettering. When my older son was about 5 he noticed that I draw letters. When
    he wanted me to show him how, the first thing I told him was to try to see beyond
    the illusional \"skeletons\" of letters. It was much harder for him to draw an
    <em>outline</em> of an ampersand than merely the linear body of an ampersand,
    but I hope I planted in him a seed that will one day become a high-reaching beanstalk.\r\n\r\nA
    great little book I recommend is \"Notan: The Dark-Light Principle of Design\"
    by D Bothwell.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I was young, I often used papercutting for lettering, cutting out forms of letters
    out of construction paper to be pasted onto posters and such. The method forces
    you to think in terms of outlines, not skeletons. Papercutting might not be for
    the youngest of children, but as they grow older it's worth encouraging, I think."

  body: "Thanks for the tips. I'm getting the Notan book for myself.\r\n\r\nThis is
    for my nephew. I don't see him that often and when I do we don't always have time
    to draw together but you've both given me ideas for lessons. His interest is not
    from seeing other people drawing letters but rather from noticing the lettering
    associated with other things he is interested in, such as skateboards. One of
    the first logos he liked was the Disney Narnia one with the lion's tail as a swashy
    leg of the R."
