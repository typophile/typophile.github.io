  into Fontlab with no success. Can anyone think of an automated way (as in accessible
  via script) to make this work without having to write a an eps interpreter or worse,
  a script for Illustrator?\r\n\r\nJust in case any Postscript hackers are reading
  this, I'm attaching the output from potrace. If there is a simple thing in the output
  that is offending Fontlab, I wouldn't mind parsing the eps to strip it out."

    from the command line. [[http://typophile.com/user/18942|Michael Boyer]] might
    be the best person to ask about that, as he seems very open to helping out with
    that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nExplained a little [[http://www.typophile.com/node/37053|here]]"

    which would allow us to import pretty much any PostScript, EPS and PDF files,
    but unfortunately, their licensing terms are quite prohibitive. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: Awesome. Thanks, Adam. It's nuts how Ghostscript uses ps to translate ps.
