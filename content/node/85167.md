body: "(Cross-posted on the OpenType list, with apologies)\r\n\r\nI've been helping
  with production of a typeface, which cycles through alternate versions of its letters.
  The idea is that the next time the same letter shows up in a line, the font will
  select the next version of that letter. So essentially each letter needs to do its
  own independent cycling. In other words, if a user types \"abbakang\" they should
  they get a b b.1 a.1 k a.2 b.2 a.3 n g1.That is, each time a specific letter comes
  up, it needs to pick the next alternate, relative to the last one that came up.\r\n\r\nI
  have no problem coming up with code to do this, but the problem is the code is freakin'
  huge. I'm wondering if there is any more efficient approach that gets the same effect?
  (I do know easy ways to do this if one just cycles through a different alternate
  where each glyph is dependent on the immediately preceding glyph. But that's not
  the assignment here, unfortunately.)\r\n\r\nOf course, it may be that there is no
  more efficient way of doing exactly this, which would be why few if any fonts have
  used this style of letter cycling.  :/\r\n\r\nHere's what I have so far, in AFDKO/FontLab
  feature syntax. The \"not_A\" class contains every glyph *except* the A and its
  variant forms. Similarly the \"not_B\" class.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature calt {\r\n

  body: "(Use \"pre\", not \"code\"...)\r\n\r\nThis might be crazy, but what if you
    put each set of alternates into a class, e.g.:\r\n\r\n<pre>@alts1 = [A.1 B.1 C.1
    ...];\r\n@alts2 = [A.2 B.2 C.2 ...];\r\n@alts3 = [A.3 B.3 C.3 ...];</pre>\r\n\r\nThen
    you (maybe) would need only one cascade. Not sure what the \"@not_\" classes would
    look like. Just a thought."

    the client is after. Or perhaps you have something different in mind...? Can you
    show me a snippet of the code using these classes?\r\n\r\nAndreas: No, we haven't
    actually tested a full-on implementation using the massive code approach. I think
    we are about to do that, however.  I wouldn't expect MakeOTF to generate anything
    noticeably better than FontLab, as FontLab is based on the same code as MakeOTF.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I think only one @everything class is needed as the "wildcard" in the middle
    instead of the many @not_somethings... same length of lookup, but much fewer classes.

    cycle is then also part of it. That doesn't work....

    sub A A A' because the second A is already A.1... It does work!

    A.1 in your @everything class if you want it to work for your BB, CC, etc. lookups,

  body: "I have tried a font cycling five sets of capitals (A-Z) with the code like
    Thomas posted, and it works very well with only one class containing all the capitals
    from the five sets, space and punctuation.\r\nThe real limitation of this code
    though is that it doesn't look further than six steps back, and the code gets
    much longer with each additional step... And with each five new glyphs longer
    still. \r\nYou might want to add some more conventional 'shuffle' lookup before
    this code to avoid always starting with the same set of versions, and to help
    glyphs from different sets mix together more evenly. "
