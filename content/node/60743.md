body: "I'm having issues when I'm trying to test out fonts I've generated from Fontlab.
  Here's my usual process:\r\n\r\n\u2022 I generate the font\r\n\r\n\u2022 I create
  a new set in Font Explorer X and import my new font into that set\r\n\r\n\u2022\_I
  activate the set and try it out in Illustrator or Indesign\r\n\r\nAt this point,
  everything is fine. But then if I make changes to the font in Fontlab and generate
  a new font, I run into problems:\r\n\r\n\u2022 I generate the font\r\n\r\n\u2022
  I deactivate the old font in Font Explorer X and delete it (Font Explorer isn't
  moving my fonts to its own library, so the font I'm generating from Fontlab is replacing
  the version the Font Explorer is accessing).\r\n\r\n\u2022 I import the new version
  of the font\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, two things happen. Either the applications
  still use the old version of the font (even after restarting them), or when I go
  to use the font in InDesign (or whatever), no characters show up.\r\n\r\n\r\nAm
  I doing something wrong, or is there a better way to test out in-progress fonts?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

  body: The notorious font caching under Mac OS X makes the testing of fonts quite
    tricky. I don't like testing on production machines and we had some problems on
    Macs after using for instance FontFinagler for cleaning the caches (which could
    have been caused by other factors). So, I was very pleased when both VMware Fusion
    and Parallels Desktop started to support the server version of Leopard. From that
    moment on we could test our fonts (and software) at least for Mac OS 10.5.x on
    clean images (sometimes in combination with cache cleaners), like we did for many
    years with the different Windows editions already. It seems that Snow Leopard
    will be supported by VMWare and Parallels too, which is nice.

  body: "A few things:\r\n\u2022 If you can avoid it, don\u2019t use FontExplorer
    for testing fonts unless it really is the final version. Just drop the fonts into
    the Adobe fonts directory. That way if something goes wrong you don\u2019t have
    to consider FEX as a variable.\r\n\u2022 Clear the application and system caches
    and reboot\r\n\u2022 Make sure that your regular weight is named correctly. If
    the regular weight of a font has misconfigured name information, the Adobe apps
    can freak out and not load fonts from the family properly until a correctly named
    regular weight has been installed."
