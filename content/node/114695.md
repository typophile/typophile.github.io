  on John Hollenbeck's Claudia Quintet's most recent albums.\r\nThe capital Q is very
  distinctive, as you can see here :\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jh1_0_5812.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  been looking around quite a while but found nothing that matches\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jh10_0_3836.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso
  apparently the numerals used in the tracklist are a monospace variation, as the
  \"1\" on the following image appears to miss the slant\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jh7_0_6015.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot folks! \r\n"
