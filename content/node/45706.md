  the Feliciano website seems to be down. The one time I got to it, I believe it showed
  10 fonts in the family, for about $320 US. Merlo is also offered by Village for
  $120 the family, but the family is four fonts --  though the two \"expert\" fonts
  do include os figs & small caps.\r\n\r\nAnybody know what else comes with the family
  from Feliciano? In principle, I'd prefer the designer get all the money, but the
  iffy website is a problem.\r\n\r\nTIA, Charles"

  body: "Charles, my impression from the Village web site is that Village is more
    of a cooperative than most foundries, and so each gets a bigger cut of the sales.
    That may be why Feliciano's web site has not been kept up so much. \r\n\r\nFrom
    the site:\r\n\r\n\"We are the union of eleven young type foundries who have decided
    to go it alone, together. vllg.com is the information channel and boutique storefront
    for this group of equals.\""

  body: "I recently purchased Merlo.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/44367\r\n\r\nThe
    version from Vllg is actually better than the version Mario actually sells. It
    has more ligatures, dingbats, and several other important features like fractions.\r\n\r\nThere
    also differences in the vertical bearings and kerning:\r\n\r\nvllg:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vllg_5649.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nfelliciano:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/felliciano_3949.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever
    the version that he sells has alternates in the italics that I really love:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merloalts_5447.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Mario tells me there is an opentype version on the way soon. Hopefully all the
    features will be united.\r\nUntil then, buy the Vllg version then request from
    Mario the version he has.\r\n\r\nI really love using it. Next on my list from
    him is Rongel. I really love his work.\r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply. It can be hard to tell from the screen,
    but in your sample, I prefer the letterforms (ascenders & descenders) of the Feliciano.
    If/when I get it, I'll wait until the Feliciano website is up. "
