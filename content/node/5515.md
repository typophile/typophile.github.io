  body: You search for &#34;eclat &#43; font&#34; and the top two links are searchfreefonts.com
    &#40;links you to agfamonotype&#41; and fonts-free.com &#40;links again to agfamonotype&#41;.
    What is going on? Not that I want a free version, it would probably not work the
    same, but what do they think they are doing?
