  (shown below)\r\n\r\nThe company who makes the vests (first picture) tells me that
  they got the numbers from a sail making company. May this could help. The second
  picture, i think with the same numbers, i found during my google-search with the
  search-words \"sail\" or \"sail making\".\r\n\r\nThanks in advance (and sorry for
  my bad english)\r\nSebastian"

    accompanying font. That said, here are some similars: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emtype/geogrotesque_family_pack_ot/">Geogrotesque</a>,

    bought separately and glued/ironed/sewed/whatever-you-do-with-them to the sailcloth.\r\n\r\nBut
    hey, just a guess from my side.\r\n\r\nMaybe <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed/\">Heroic
