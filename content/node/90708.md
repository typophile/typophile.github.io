  it with, but as a designer I'd like to be more confident about what's a reasonable
  resolution for producing a file for a certain context. This mostly applies to images,
  because type, of course, remains as curves in PDFs, but I'm curious about type as
  well: even if the resolution is determined only when it gets to the press, what
  will that resolution be? So I'm asking just for some examples of the resolution
  of different printed materials: things made on digital presses vs. offset presses;
  newspapers vs. magazines. How about those coffee table art books? I haven't found
  a handy reference for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWhen I am scanning or exporting
  imagery I usually do it at the highest DPI possible, even if I know that the printer
  isn't capable of maintaining that DPI. Is there any detriment to this? (Other than
  enormous files, which some people mind but have never bothered me.)\r\n\r\nAnd is
  it just me, or can you get away with much lower resolution on images than on type?
  The same printer that producers gorgeous, detailed photographs can't seem to make
  type look smooth enough.\r\n\r\nAll thoughts are welcome!"

  body: "For images destined for print, the thing that drives the equation is the
    the halftone linescreen (and to a lesser extent, the relationship between linescreen
    and the output resolution of the rendering device). \r\n\r\nGenerally the rule
    of thumb is that you need at least 1:1 image resolution to linescreen, and more
    than 2:1 image resolution to linescreen is a waste of file space. \r\n\r\nSince
    a majority of commercial printing is done at 150 linescreen, the rule of thumb
    for images is 300 ppi at actual size.\r\n\r\nIf you have more than 2 pixels for
    every halftone dot, then you\u2019re going to end up having pixels that \u201Cfall
    through the cracks,\u201D so to speak, and never end up influencing a printed
    dot at all.\r\n\r\nOne could argue, I suppose, that with 4c you could use greater
    resolution because the different screen angles have dots falling at different
    interstices. But I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find any difference.\r\n\r\nAn
    advantage of optimizing image resolution for targeted linescreen (as opposed to
    just providing maximum resolution, if it\u2019s greater than, say 2.5x linescreen)
    is that this allows you to more carefully target any unsharp masking values in
    order to increase perceived sharpness and clarity. At too high an image resolution
    in relation to linescreen, any unsharp masking will get lost \u201Cbetween the
    cracks\u201D and the image will not be as sharp.\r\n\r\nCoffee table art books
    are usually printed at 175 linescreen; sometimes higher. It depends on the stock
    and the press and how fine a dot it\u2019s possible to hold reliably. The finer
    the linesceen, the smoother and more detailed an image.\r\n\r\nSome high-end printing
    uses stochastic screening (aka frequency modulation), which is a whole different
    beast. Stochastic allows for much finer placement of dots. But again, the dot
    size is going to be determined by press & paper conditions. I don\u2019t recall
    offhand the math for resolution for stochastic. Depending upon your dot, though,
    you can figure that higher image resolutions may be of value."

  body: "Oh, forgot to address the relationship of halftone linescreen to output device
    resolution.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the two will determine the number
    of possible gradations between white (no dot) and solid. If the output device
    resolution is insufficient to allow for an adequate range of dots between 0 and
    100%, then there will be perceptible banding.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have
    an output resolution of 600 dpi (a desktop laserprinter, for instance), and you
    print an image at 150 lpi, then each dot of your halftone will be composed of
    a maximum of 16 toner dots: 600\xF7150 = 4 dots in each dimension \u2192 4\xD74
    = 16 toner dots per halftone dot. \r\n\r\nTherefore, you can have only 16 different
    values in gradation from none to black (well, 17 if you count white). With only
    16 levels of grey + white, that\u2019s a 6.25% jump between each level of grey,
    and you\u2019re going to have a posterized reproduction.\r\n\r\nThis is a somewhat
    simplified and abstracted example, since it assumes essentially non-round dots.
    To produce rounded dots in an adequate range of values, the math is a little different,
    depending upon the algorithm for shaping the dots.\r\n\r\nBut you get the idea.\r\n\r\nSo,
    in addition to being constrained by press/paper conditions, optimum halftone linescreen
    for a job may be influenced by the resolution of the output device that is producing
    the film or plate. Which in turn determines your optimum image pixel resolution."

    But I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find any difference.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    dots for all colors are spaced out exactly the same. It may appear they do not
    if you are examining a horizontal line; but the only difference is that each color
    is printed at another angle to prevent Moir\xE9.\r\n\r\nI feel it's the other
    way around: a full-color image may touch the lower bottom of \"acceptable resolution\"
    <em>because</em> it is to be printed full-color. Any slightly visible pixelation
    on one color plate will surely be masked by three other plates, each with a slightly
    different offset -- and thus slightly different pixelation.\r\n\r\nIf you consider
    pure black-and-white images -- with or without type -- go as high as you possibly
    can. Monochrome bitmaps (of the <em>only</em> black-and-white kind, not a true-color
    image that just happens to use no more colors) will be passed on to a printer
    at their original resolution. A 300-dpi monochrome bitmap will look crystal clear
    in print, with pixels that are visible to the naked eye; if I need a bitmap image,
    I'm going for broke, at 800 dpi or more. Now <em>that</em> usually renders my
    bitmaps razor sharp.\r\n\r\n(There is a physical upper limit: if you approach
    the resolution of the output device, say, a plate-maker, your tiniest details
    might get lost because this bitmap has to be aligned with the device's own pixels.
    But you are talking about something like 3000 dpi, for a typical industry standard
    plate-maker. Each pixel will measure less than 1/100th of a millimeter.)"

    And the imagesetter basically renders along that line. So it could be argued that
    a pixel which would fall between dots on the black plate, would fall on the dot
    of the magenta plate (just as a hypothetical example).\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t buy
    the argument, myself, since the likelihood of changing the magenta dot significantly
    is miniscule.\r\n\r\n<cite> > I feel it's the other way around: a full-color image

  body: For black and white line art, 300ppi is a common standard, and it's okay,
    but 600ppi is noticeably better to the naked eye (at least to mine), especially
    if there is type or lettering in the image. Before computers, screening a greyscale
    image would fuzz out any solid black in it, but modern output can print halftone
    greys and preserve sharp black lines in the same image. The experience I speak
    from is in publishing comic strips. As you say, continuous-tone photographs do
    not require nearly as much fidelity, because the difference between one pixel
    and the next is indiscernible when they're close to the same color, plus they
    are entirely subject to the linescreen.

    type that overprints photos? In some situations type can be accidentally rasterized
    when it overprints a photo, resulting in lower type quality. If you're using InDesign,
    putting the type on a separate layer can help prevent that."

    this. I mean that 600 dpi prints a decent photo but not very nice type.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also sightly more confused than I was when I started, but maybe that's a good
    thing. My confusion might have to do with lpi versus dpi, which I now, thanks
    to kentlew, have a much better understanding of. But still, the examples that
    have been given so far seem to be using numbers that sound to me extremely low.
    I have a friend who's a designer at a publisher of fine art books and said that
    all digital images had to be something like a minimum of 20,000 dpi and an ideal
    of 50,000 \u2014 and yes, that's the right number of zeroes. Is this logical?
    Is there any printing process that preserves that resolution?\r\n\r\nHow about
    resolution as it applies to solid type, not halftones? (dpi, not lpi)  What do
    you consider ideal? What's standard?"

  body: "So, what about type? In this case, you have a completely different set of
    considerations.\r\n\r\nThe two main effects of output device resolution will be
    resolvable differences and smoothness. These are basically the same issues you
    encounter with type on the screen, except in print the resolutions are higher
    and there isn\u2019t any anti-aliasing (gray levels to increase perceived smoothness).\r\n\r\nAverage-quality
    imagesetters generally run in the range of 1270 dpi. (High-quality imagesetters
    will generally run about double that, maybe more.)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take the
    example of an average text type output from an average 1270 dpi imagesetter. And
    let\u2019s say that we\u2019re rendering a font with 1000 upm (standard Postscript
    em).\r\n\r\nThe full 11-point height of your em will be made up of 194 imaging
    dots: 11pt \xF7 72 pts/inch = 0.1527 inches; \xD7 1270 dots/inch = 194 dots.\r\n\r\nSince
    the full 11-point height of your font is defined as 1000 em units, that means
    that the diameter of a single toner dot is equivalent to about 5.15 em units.\r\n\r\nWhat
    that means is that the resolvable difference is about 5 em units. Depending upon
    where your outlines fall, you probably won\u2019t be able to render a difference
    between a stem of 84 units and one of 87 units, for example, or a serif height
    of 30 vs 34, perhaps.\r\n\r\n(This is oversimplifying a bit, because there are
    several tricks built into the type rendering algorithms of Postscript imagesetters.)\r\n\r\nThere
    will also be nuances of curves that are similarly undifferentiatable because the
    differences fall beneath the threshold of device resolvability.\r\n\r\nOn that
    same 1270 dpi imagesetter, however, anything above about 57 pts will be rendered
    with full resolvability, since the 1000 upm will now be rendered with at least
    1000 imaging dots.\r\n"

  body: "As I said, the other characteristic will be smoothness. \r\n\r\nA vertical
    line is no problem. Perfectly smooth, regardless of resolution. But as you deviate
    from vertical or horizontal, you will get stair-stepping; how much and to what
    degree will depend upon how fine the imaging dot is (which is to say, how high
    the resolution is).\r\n\r\nThe higher the resolution, the finer the stair-stepping
    and the potentially smoother an angled line or curve.\r\n\r\nAt angles with smaller
    deviation from pure vertical or horizontal, this will be more apparent. This is
    just a basic fact of approximating an angle or curve on any grid.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s
    say you have an \u2018o\u2019 in our hypothetical 11-point text face rendered
    by our hypothetical 1270 dpi imagesetter. And let\u2019s say that the x-height
    is around 500 units (on the larger side for a text face, imo, but easier math
    ;-)\r\n\r\nThis \u2018o\u2019 will be rendered with about 97 imaging dots, in
    the vertical dimension. (Well, okay, maybe 100 dots with overshoot.) Will that
    be smooth enough?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/o-1270_5918.png]\r\n\r\nBlown
    up like this and at full monitor pixels, maybe not. But at physical size on paper?
    Probably.\r\n\r\nWhat about the same at 600 dpi output?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/o-600-2x_4210.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    just plain reading, and for the average person: probably. For a typophile examining
    closely: probably not.\r\n\r\nBut remember, also: stair-stepping and jaggedness
    in the rendering can be ameliorated by aspects of the physical reproduction process
    \u2014 e.g., ink spread in offset printing, or droplet scatter in inkjet printing.\r\n\r\nThis
    \u2018o\u2019 is a broad curve, with plenty of surface for rendering. What about
    a serif bracket? Or what about a stem with subtle swelling?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s
    enough? One of those reading-science types will have to weigh in with how fine
    a difference the average human eye can resolve \u2014 i.e., how large those jaggies
    have to be at what distance, etc.\r\n"
