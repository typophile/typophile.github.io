body: "Both Word and PowerPoint 2008 for Mac are displaying some Postscript fonts
  incorrectly.  There are 3 different menus which list fonts in Word 2008, and the
  fonts in question are sometimes missing certain styles in one menu, and missing
  others in a different menu.  We are most concerned about a Bitstream font called
  Geometric 415.  I have tried to tweak the font menu names in TransType Pro, with
  some success, but cannot get the problem to completely go away.  I have contacted
  Microsoft, Bitstream, and the place we bought the fonts from, but with no luck yet.\r\n\r\nAny
  Ideas would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Since you have Transtype Pro already, the simplest solution would be to convert
    the postscript fonts to Postscript-flavored Opentype fonts. I'm not familiar with
    the conversion details of PS -> OT in TransType, so hopefully someone will point
    out if there are downsides to this -- I would think it is just essentially adding
    the OpenType wrapper to the existing PS data, so you're not going to deal with
    the usual degradation or or other issues that sometimes arise from converting
    one type format to another.
