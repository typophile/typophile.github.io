  been very unique. I am recently enrolled in a class that is technically running
  a furniture design company. The business department has teamed up with the design
  department and we are selling limited [edition] signed furniture pieces. We have
  come up with a whole new idea this semester when it comes to art and room design.
  We have come up with a movement called room deco. It is very new and very unique.
  Basically the idea behind room deco is that an individual builds his or her home
  around the idea that every piece you put in your home is an actual art piece signed
  by a specific  designer. Really this movement allows the collector to become the
  artist. If you want to see some of our designs for this class you can go to www.brandspankinnew.org"

    Although, there are only a few furniture collectors here.

    letters can be coverted into furniture. (An overstuffed sofa as an m?)
