body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWhen you make localisation features (locl) for substitutions
  such:\r\n\r\nlanguage TRK;\r\n  # Turkish\r\n  sub i by i.latn_TRK;\r\n\r\nis it
  necessary also to address its small caps counterpart? ( sub i.sc by i.latn_TRK.sc;
  )\r\nor this is not really needed since i.latn_TRK will be made i.latn_TRK.sc by
  the 'smcp' feature?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro."

  body: "Unless your localization feature applies after your small caps feature (which
    would defeat the whole purpose) then there should be no need.\r\n\r\nThe normal
    substitutions needed would be:\r\n\r\n<code>feature locl {\r\n\_\_script latn;\r\n\_\_language
    TRK exclude_dflt;\r\n\_\_\_\_sub i by i.trk;\r\n} locl;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    smcp {\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_sub i by i.sc;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_# if using separate
    glyphs for smcp/c2sc</code>\r\n<code>\_  \_\_sub dotlessi by dotlessi.sc;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_sub
    i.trk by i.trk.sc;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_# if using the same glyphs for smcp/c2sc</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_sub

  body: "Hi Ramiro\r\nAs far as I know, in your code you for localized forms you only
    need\r\nlookup locl_TRK {\r\nsub i by i.TRK;\r\n} locl_TRK;\r\n\r\nIn your small
    caps feature you should substitute both i and i.TRK\r\nsmcp {\r\nsub i by i.smcp;\r\nsub
    i.TRK by i.TRK.smcp;\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\nBe sure to put the locl feature above smcp,
    so when you activate locl for TRK, i will be substituted by i.TRK and then when
    you activate smcp the i.TRK will be subsituted by i.TRK.smcp, on the other hand
    if locl for TRK is deactivated and you activate smcp, i will be substituted by
    i.smcp\r\n\r\nThere are other ways of doing this. I hope this works.\r\nYou also
    can read this comment by Twardoch http://typophile.com/node/17787\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n"

  body: "\"locl\" should indeed be included before other features in the font. Then,
    you can just make plain substitutions of the localized glyphs (since they've been
    swapped in the locl feature) using the regular \"latn/dflt\" context (which is
    available if you don't use the explicit language statement). Of course you do
    need to make sure that in smcp, you're replacing i.latn_TRK with a *dotted* small-cap
    i, while the regular i should be replaced with an undotted smallcap i. That is,
    actually, the very purpose of employing the locl feature: i and i.latn_TRK look
    identical as they are, but the \"locl\" swap allows you to use two different input
    glyphs when performing OpenType replacements that are functionally case substitutions
    (smcp, pcap, titl, case etc.). \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
