  and got an account. Don't hurt me too badly, please...\r\n\r\nI'm working on a graphics
  package for a \"butterfly exhibit\" at a botanical center, consisting of graphics
  for both informational and identification purposes. I have a few ideas of what I
  think might and might not work for a title font throughout, but was wondering if
  anyone else had any thoughts. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome background on the exhibit: It is
  a large greenhouse filled with flowering nectar plants and butterflies. Visitors
  are of all ages, and the graphic panels are probably no smaller than 18\" x 24\".
  \r\n\r\nAny ideas on a font that goes well with butterflies? I'm thinking something
  that addresses their symmetry, and lightweight frame...\r\n\r\n(One of my concerns
  is keeping this from looking too much like a wedding invitation. Script fonts are
  out, unless someone has the audacity to convince me otherwise...)\r\n\r\n-Thanks
  for your help"

    with Historical Allsorts (HF&J) for a \"Moth Exhibit\" logo I worked. I slightly
    rounded the Neutraface to match my symbol.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/random/mothSymbol.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    recently ran into this in a book or magazine (don't remember where, and don't
    know the fonts - haha), I really like it because it's classy and they didn't do
    the typical \"organic\" feel\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/random/typeSample3.jpg\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps!\r\n\r\n- Mike"

    we did a butterflies exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History. Thesis
    Sans (everybody thinks it's TheSans) was used throughout their wayfinding and
    identity system and it worked very well.

    way about script fonts (and I have done my fair share of wedding work when starting
    out) and they just scream \"no\" at me for myriad reasons because of that.\r\n\r\nI
    did however recently \"discover\" [[http://misprintedtype.com/v3/fonts.php|misprintedtype.com]],
    and two faces there, Selfish and Porcelain might be worth you having a quick look
    at. \r\n\r\nThey're both, I would suppose \"grunge\" scripts, but they do convey
    movement (and possibly the slight otherworldliness of the butterfly's directions),
    and I got away with sparse use of Selfish as a drop cap in a horticultural piece.\r\n\r\nLike
    I said, I'm ready to be shouted down here. :)\r\n\r\nAnd Mike, just like to add
    what a gorgeous piece of work that is. And envy is no good at this time in the

    These are all great suggestions. I've actually been looking for an excuse to use
    Neutraface for quite a while now. Jean Paul, Matrix Inline looks pretty good as
    well. Bert, thanks for the additional info on Thesis.\r\n\r\nMike, your second
    image, the one you found, looks nice too.  The type for the word \"Butterflies\"
    is what I was trying to avoid, but somehow I kind of like it. I looked around
    a bit to find a match, but didn't find anything really that close..."

    It's got that crazy, unpredictable back-and forth movement of a butterfly's flight
    pattern.
