  <BR>I have been designing it on an LCD screen, so It will be good to see how it
  holds up on Mr. Anybody&#39;s screen. I took no gret pains to pick suitable greys,
  but I forsee I will need to make careful revisions. As it stands, there is Black
  and three greys. <BR> <BR>Still havent got that X right, and the V and W are giving
  me trouble at this size. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;ve seen my brother&#39;s post about
  his bitmap font composition software &#40;made in php or html or something&#41;
  then know that I&#39;ll probably adding this one to its catologue. By catologue
  I mean the severely unfinished one that already exists :-S. <BR> <BR>- Chris

  body: Black, white and three grays is a solid basis, but your results are too fuzzy
    - too reliant on Gray. I bet you&#39;re using a Mac, which has a flatter gamma
    than Windows, but the latter should be your [main] target. Another thing you don&#39;t
    want is light grays at the ends by themselves; around 70 is the lightest you should
    go for &#34;body&#34; elements. <BR> <BR>Also I&#39;d suggest taking one pixel
    from the descenders and giving it to the x-height. <BR> <BR>hhp
