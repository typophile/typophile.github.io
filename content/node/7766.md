body: i am currently doing an identity system for a school project, and I am looking
  for a nice text face that works with a technology company. This will be used to
  write the letter on the letterhead. I also need a typeface to be paired with this
  that will be used for the secondary info on the letterhead &#40;and business cards/envelopes&#41;
  that will be used for the address etc. The company specialized in digital imaging,
  with an emphasis on scanning.  <BR> <BR>I am open to both serif and sans serif faces.
  I have a few in mind, but would like some ideas to explore some faces I may not
  know about.  <BR> <BR>Thanks so much.

    Indie Font books. Otherwise I bet you get the usual suspects.

  body: thanks for the suggestion... i just grabbed them off my bookshelf. Im only
    a little concerned as this is a student project, and some of these fonts are really
    expensive <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

  body: Maybe Jason you could contact someone at the foundry that you like. Maybe
    there is a student discount or an incomplete font that wouldn&#39;t cut it for
    commercial usage. Alot of these designers hang out here. Okay type design guys
    and dolls any suggestions for Jason.

  body: oh and by the way, of the type i currently have, i am looking at scala sans,
    dax, and faceflate sans as the type to set the business cards and address etc
    on the letterhead/envelope. As the logo uses a handdrawn sans serif, I am thinking
    the body of the the actual letter on the letterhead should be a serif face for
    contrast, although my teacher said a sans serif would be more &#34;technology.&#34;
    What do you all think?

  body: 'Make the idenity of the letter and collateral technology looking. Leave the
    body of the letter to  convey information.  <BR> <BR>As an example: Think of Technology
    ID as Chocolate Ice Cream, now if you just add more Chocolate Ice Cream &#40;the
    body of the letter&#41; you wouldn&#39;t have any contrast or flavor. Make the
    body of the letter a Vanilla Cookie and now you have contrast in color, texture
    and flavor.'
