  body: There are many similar techno-computer-micr style fonts available, but none
    that I've seen quite like your image. It looks like it was created in 1963 or
    1964. It would be nice to find that it has since been digitized.

  body: "Coll_hand  that album cover was post 1990, printed in England,  so you're
    right - it's very likely available as a font. Somewhere. Between the poster and
    the album cover, there's just about enough information to use as the basis for
    a new version l..\r\n\r\n Other similar fonts include:\r\nAutoMission (Toto)\r\nAutomation
    (Possibly Filmotype, also available as a renamed version of Otto Mason)\r\nOtto
    Mason (Soft Horizons)\r\nK22GKWComputer (Toto)\r\nURWDaliD (URW)\r\nWestminster

  body: "Update: \r\nI have managed to find my complete alphabet samples of this font.\r\nHowever
    it appears Grignani redrew many of the characters for his book cover and may have
    also changed some of the weight through the stems. I have found out it was originally
    published by a Swizz photo-setting house and was available as headline setting
    via typesetters in London under various names. It appears to be a variation of
    the ECB font designed in 1958 for use on bank cheques. It appears to have disappeared
    after the typesetting houses went on of business in the late 80's.\r\nI've drawn
    up a basic version for what I needed it for but would be interested to find some
    better samples than the ones I have and find out a little bit more about the font
    itself - if there were other versions and who should be credited for the original
    design. "
