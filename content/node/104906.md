  I need something that has a classical vibe (obviously) but that also has a subtle
  Art Nouveau and/or Arts & Crafts thing going on, too. Nothing too decorative \u2013just
  open, humanist and especially compatible with Diotima's characters a, b, e, m, and
  p. Something slightly wide, like the 105-110% horizontal scale range. Thanks in
  advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DiotimaLTStdRoman_6149.png]"

    up with for similar matches. Thanks, J Weltin.

    have to stick with Optima.

  body: "The thing with pairing a sans with a very trad serif like Diotima is that
    a sans needs to be based around the classical proportions, and not many are. An
    example of a classically-proportioned sans is of course Gill Sans.\r\nHowever,
    perhaps you could look at Frantisek Storm's Sebastian. It comes in 6 weights,
    and is a beautiful design. Only downside is slightly petite Small Caps, but I
    recommend it.\r\nIf you're trying to match Diotima's full bowls and high x-height,
    try American Gothic OPTI. there's a sans and the 'tick' serif. It's at http://opti.netii.net/fonts-a/index.htm,
    a display face in three weights. (the sans is not here). Cheers.\r\n"
