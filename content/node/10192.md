body: There&#39;s several GREAT sets of fonts from Bitstream, one of which I desperately
  need to finish a job, but unfortunately, the font is ONLY available through the
  Linspire people, and ONLY if you&#39;re running their software, due to their shopping
  cart setup. Being on OSX 10.3.8, that won&#39;t happen. So how can I get ahold of
  the font, which is named Crazy Loot?

    that none of the constituents become zeroed? I have completely forgotten how to
    do this.
