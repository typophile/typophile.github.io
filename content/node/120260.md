  not entirely sure if this looks OK or if I should change the tracking to make it
  look better (I'm not a pro designer!).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how this text could
  be spaced better or is it fine??\r\n\r\nThanks for helping out.\r\n\r\nAll the best..\r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would actually avoid using a fixed-width font in a context like this. I
    would adjust the kerning (manually if necessary) to make the perceived distance
    between adjacent letters consistent.
