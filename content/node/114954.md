  body: "Nicely done, Ryuk (and nice font).\r\n\r\nMay I reveal my inadequacy and
    ask how you found that? I tried 'script' plus' spiderlike' and then 'script' plus
    'thin' as searches and had no luck (I've added these as MyFonts tags for the font)."

  body: Thanks a lot Mike. I simply recognize it at first sight, thought its name
    was something like "conspiracy lover" and designed by Mans Greback... Was half-wrong
    :D Then I used MyFonts which automatically corrected the name and gave me the
    right answer... Conspired Lovers by Herald Geisler and not Conspiracy Love by
    Mans Greback!
