I look at magazines and they are boring, ultra "sanitary," no personality... and students are being fed Helvetica and all its variants, ad nauseam. Then when they encounter something with an "out of the box" appearance (no matter how bad) they think that it is a font because the do not have the skills to differentiate, or how to engage an artist to do what they need. Or worse yet... they are to cheap to pay for original art to enhance the product!</div>

I am quite aware that this could be a custom design. However, I'm also aware that there is a trend happening with hand-generated fonts, aka 'Hand-Set' fonts, that do not necessarily end up as full body typefaces (in the traditional sense – with formatting and alternates).

You can see some examples here:
1) http://www.youworkforthem.com/list.php?cat=113
2) http://www.t26.com/illustrations/Wood_Type_Bundle
3) http://www.t26.com/illustrations/SketchType

And given that the image was taken from a week-to-week HTML email (which you'd think would be a bit overkill to produce some custom lettering for), I was hoping someone might have come across this.

I have posted with consideration folks.

		<div class="commentbody">Of course a lot of respondents with the knee-jerk "not a font" response have been (or should have been) red-faced to find that "hand-drawn" really was a font. Even if it was not, rebuking a poster is not a preferred response.

Even if something was hand-drawn, often there are more than a few fonts that come close to replicating the same feel.

In this instance it is not a font... I knew it and had no problem stating such. I have no problems suggesting an alternative. I just get tired of people going "what is that font" without the slightest bit of knowledge, assuming something like this is a font. I do not accept the premise that if it is in print it must be a font, which is what a lot people assume.

As one who earns his living with calligraphy, lettering, hand drawn  etc. forms I figure I don't f*** up that much when calling something like this. If I am not sure, I keep my mouth shut. So do not include me in your witch hunt of erroneous font/non font identifiers with red faces!</div>

I do not f*** up because I do not state what I do not know, it does not say I am the smartest person in the field of letters. Name calling is not what I did. Just stating opinions.

As for the other posters, I deem you took a fair amount of time considering your responses to each others reactive posts. Some advice – consider placing your energy in a more productive direction. Steve and Typerror, your help and expertise is greatly appreciated on this board, just remember that, whether a minority or majority, some people are posting with context.

Cheers for your help!

My point was first that because of the amateurish nature of the lettering and the fact there were no duplicates it is most likely hand lettering. I do realize there are a number of simple free fonts like this available, but these usually don't include enough alternates to do this setting. 
Secondly… I'm not trying to come off sounding so pointed towards you particularly. I'm sure you have valid reasons for posting. I've just seen so many postings that do assume everything must be a font. I even had a potential client a short while ago asking about a using my font for her logo like the one in my "hand lettered" design. I actually had to explain a few times that it was in fact not a font. The fact that you also asked for an alternative at least showed you were open to the possibility it wasn't type. I did actually search to find something close, but didn't see anything all that close to the sample. Granted my tone was a bit sour. I don't typically have harsh comments and so I apologize for that.

You might consider asking the folks who send out the weekly HTMLemail about the lettering. I imagine they would let you know if it was a font or handlettering. It's possible they have a custom font.</div>
