    up well. I'll fix that.\r\n\r\n7 Down: I was thinking it might be \"Latin\", but
    wasn't sure.\r\n\r\nI'm also thinking Unger's bird is referencing Johann Unger
    of Unger-Fractur, but I don't know what bird it's talking about. \r\n\r\n"

    if its the color that is strong both on white and black ... i think SET defines
    the grayness of a text so makes it the third color of typography."
