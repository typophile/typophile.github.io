  both the typeface and the weight.</li>\r\n<li>Show off your knowledge by casually
  mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first)
  published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The
  winner produces a new challenge -- a complete glyph, black on white background,
  presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The
  person who posts a challenge can't win the next game.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any

    a few months ago in an old comics magazine from the 40s, "Little Lulu", and it
    felt unusual, quirky, and ahead of its time. Strangely, it's almost got too much
    weird and ill-fitting detail at Display sizes (except perhaps in these ultra weights),
    but it's really a pleasure to read, and would even make a good web font, I think.

    prominently on the foundry site (you have to download the specimen PDF and then
    on p. 24 you will see that the family *has* an interrobang) \u2013 so this specific
    glyph really is a bit hard to find. Sorry :-\\\r\nIt is a little bit better to
    see on the (<em>lovely</em>) web site of one of the two designers who collaborated
    on this. These two guys live literally half a world apart \u2013 but the person
    this typeface is named after was concerned with things even much further away... "

    Sowersby might have something to do with it, I'd checked Newzald of course. You
    have a great collection of fonts, Nina.
