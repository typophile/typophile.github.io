    the i is bigger, the characters are 'rounder' and more extended, and the serifs
    are more pronounced.\r\n\r\nThis feels like Mrs. Eaves. This tastes like Mrs.
    Eaves. So I guess it <em>is</em> Mrs. Eaves.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EFBaskerville_6625.gif]"

  body: 'I suppose you all know the similarities between Baskerville and Mrs. Eaves
    are no coincidence. As I recall, Emigre (Zazana Licko) introduced Mrs. Eaves as
    a modernization of Baskerville and named the font after his (Baskerville''s) mistress. '
