  try to find logic in this font, nor the harmony of the forms.\r\nIt is meant to
  be crank. All the letters were first cut in linoleum and then digitized. Hence,
  everything is alive. You will find no uniform elements. We think this font will
  find its use in the hands of a brave designer.\r\nDesigner: Nika Nekrasova\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MessyLinocut2D_720x360_07_4278.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MessyLinocut2D_720x360_05_4978.png]\r\n\r\nOn
