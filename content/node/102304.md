  tweaked/manipulated in fontlab. The files/css work fine on Mac's but don't display
  on any windows machines. Has anyone had any issues with this?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "It looks like a hinting problem, but I wonder about the \u201Cloose dirt\u201D.
    Is this a distressed font? That would probably explain why it renders as it does.
    If the EULA permits it, can you send me font file?"

  body: "Frode's right, this is a hinting issue. I assume that in your TrueType generating
    preferences you have \"autohint unhinted glyphs\" checked. Try unchecking that
    and re0-generating the fonts. If this is a distressed font, it probably won't
    benefit from autohinting. \r\n\r\n"

    un-closed vectors and clean it up but seems to still have the issue. I''m just

  body: Could you let us know what the original font is? Looking at the pictures you
    have posted I am (perhaps hastily) assuming that you did not part with cash or
    haggle over license terms...

  body: The original font is Pound (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/pound/),
    And yes it was purchased with license for the client.
