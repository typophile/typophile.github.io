  body: Very hard to tell, even with HD active, video doesn't allow you much bigger
    samples. Still very small, neutral, could be a lot of things. I came to the same
    conclusion as you. I see no contradiction with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]].

      that's why I was asking if someone had a different view/opinion. \r\nThanks
      for your comment, right now Avenir is the closest one.\r\nLet's see if other
      suggestions come up."
