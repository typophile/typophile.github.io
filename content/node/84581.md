body: "Having recently read [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html|this]]
  and several Typophile threads concerning extended glyph sets, I thought I might
  share some custom FL codepages and encodings I had compiled. I made them for TypeTool,
  but I believe they will work with FLS also. The files were too large to attach to
  this post, so I have linked to them instead.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nENCODINGS \r\n[[http://sites.google.com/site/typeminds/public-files/AdobeLatin.zip|These
  Adobe Latin encoding pages]] are based on the Adobe Latin-3, -4, and -5 lists from
  the link above. Each contains the specified glyphs from the Adobe lists in Unicode
  order (i.e. space 1, exclam 2, quotedbl 3...) with .notdef as 0. Each Unicode glyph
  is referenced by the name given in the Adobe sources. However, non-Unicode glyphs
  are referenced by unixxxxyyyyzzzz names instead of the given Adobe names. (It seemed
  more logical to me based on [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html|this]],
  but if that's wrong, just tell me and I'll correct it.) The files contain the following
  header:\r\n\r\n%%FONTLAB ENCODING: 23; Adobe Latin-3\r\n%%GROUP: Adobe Latin\r\n%%Source:
  Adobe Latin-3 http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/latin_charsets/Adobe_Latin_3.html\r\n%%Release:
  2011-08-15\r\n%Compiled by Tucker Meyers\r\n%\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what to put for
  the number after \"Fontlab Encoding:\" so I chose 23, 24, and 25 since they didn't
  seem to be taken yet. (Again, correct me if I'm wrong here.) Note also that I chose
  to place these encodings in their own \"Adobe Latin\" group (just a personal preference).\r\n\r\nCODEPAGES\r\n[[http://sites.google.com/site/typeminds/public-files/UnicodePlanes.zip|These
  are six codepage files]], each of which represents a Unicode plane. Each of the
  six populated planes - 0, 1, 2, 14, 15, and 16 - contains all of its 65 536 codepoints
  (including reserved/nonexistent ones like 038B and FFFE - I didn't have the patience
  to go through each plane by hand and remove all of them). As the Fontlab manuals
  point out (p.110 in TypeTool, 147 in Studio), \"If you select one of these [double-byte]
  codepages, you will see an additional control to the right of the codepage selection
  list in the toolbar.... This control allows you to select a 'page' of the codepage.
  Theoretically, we may have 256 pages of 256 codes each, which give us 65,636 codes.
  In practice none of the known codepages has that many codes and usually less than
  half than number.\" If I recall correctly, it was reading this statement that urged
  me to compile these files. Here is a sample header from Plane 16:\r\n\r\n%%FONTLAB
  CODEPAGE: 0xFFFF; Unicode Plane 16\r\n%%GROUP:Custom\r\n%%Source: Unicode 6.0\r\n%%Release:
  2011-07-30\r\n%Compiled by Tucker Meyers\r\n%\r\n\r\nOnce again, my choice of group
  name was simply a matter of preference. And I didn't know what the 0xFFFF was for,
  so I left it there.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope these help. Feel free to download, distribute,
  modify - basically do anything you want with these files. (But if you do modify,
  distribute, etc., I'd appreciate if you left my name in the header.)"
