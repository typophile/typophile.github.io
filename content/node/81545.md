body: I'm trying to figure out what the 'Modifier Letters' are about. I've created
  spacing variants of grave and acute at 0060 and 00B4, and then created zero-width
  combining diacritics at 0300 and 0301. These latter two have anchors and I've used
  them to build the accented Latin glyphs from composites. Now I find there are two
  more codepoints called Modifier Letters at 02CA and 02CB. Who can tell me what they're
  for and what I should put in there?

  body: "Yeah, they\u2019re supposed to be spacing versions of the combining diacritics
    as well as a few things that don\u2019t have combining versions. So what Chris
    Harvey said. They should look exactly like the combining versions but should have
    an intrinsic width, perhaps something like a plain space (U+0020). If you have
    uppercase variants of diacritics you should only use the lowercase versions for
    the spacing modifiers, since that\u2019s what people expect the defaults to be.
    I suppose you could go to the effort of making them case sensitive, but I don\u2019t
    think people would ever use that feature much."

  body: Hah, it took me nearly half a year to remember I'd started this thread, oops,
    sorry! Thank you for your answers. I'll duplicate the 00 range.
