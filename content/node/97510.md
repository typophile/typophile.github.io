  website. The devs are telling me that it's really heavy when users download causing
  huge caching issues. \r\n\r\nThe bright idea to reduce the font weight be removing
  certain characters as now lead to this bodged jagged appearance of our font. Have
  the developers removed vital data files that effect the render in their hackjob.\r\n\r\nSo
  my question is:\r\nIs there a web version of Benton we can purchase, I couldn't
  find it anywhere.?\r\nand\r\nso webfonts aren't the holy grail that was once espoused
  if all these weight issues stop implementation?"

    be illegal to upload your house (print!) font to a web server.\r\n\r\nYou can
    get the webfont licenses here:\r\nhttp://www.webtype.com/font/benton-sans-family/"

  body: "It sounds like you are moving outside your license agreement. 1: Modifying
    the font files. 2: Uploading the font files to a web server. Nr. 1 is rarely allowed.
    Nr. 2 is allowed in very few situations, but for the most part foundries prefer
    (for licensing and technical reasons) to serve font files with renting services.
    Font Bureau\u2019s fonts are available from webtype.com. [[http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsansre-family/|Benton
    Sans RE]] is a special version of Benton Sans optimized for text sizes on screen,
    and the [[http://www.webtype.com/font/benton-sans-family/|Benton Sans Family]]
    (without the \"RE\" extension) offers the full range of styles for use at headline
    sizes.  I\u2019m not sure if Webtype have a method for automatic subsetting, but
    most other web font services do.\r\n\r\nThey do offer the option of hosting files
    on your own server. If you have special needs (re: file size etc.) I suggest you
    contact them directly via e-mail."

    specifically for rendering across different browsers (i.e., WOFF, TTF, EOT and
    SVG) and operating systems along with the ability subset by character sets to
    reduce file sizes. We offer both cloud-hosted and self-hosted licenses and a free
    30-day trial for any font. If you have any specific questions, feel free to reach

    this font that she asked for it and the seller said they didn't have it. Then
    2 days later they said they did (suspicious, could they have just converted it)\r\n\r\nSo
    it's a legit copy which she hacked down. Anyway the company has now rebranded
    to a new font Metric... uff all my effort for nothing in the end."
