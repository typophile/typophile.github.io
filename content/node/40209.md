  body: "It sounds like your IT guy was just parroting something he heard elsewhere,
    or he would have given you more useful advice. Frames, and their replacements,
    are a feature of HTML and XHTML, and are used to layout pages. CSS is a system
    used to create a visual style for a web page, and may or may not affect layout,
    depending on how the HTML/XHTML is set up. It sounds like you should probably
    take a few web design classes to get a handle on this stuff\u2014these are circa
    1999 web standards, at this point there\u2019s no reason to be designing a web
    site without a firm handle on XHTML and CSS."

  body: "Ralfs, Thanks for your feedback!\r\nI need a \"frame\" or something because
    I need an outside site to be shown in a specific page w/o actually leaving my
    site. (Not really about the scrolling part of CSS)\r\nI need users to be linked
    there (booking engineer) without leaving the site and I'm being honest...I don\u2019t
    know how to do that. :(\r\nThanks\r\n"

    heart on your head. You look like you're soliciting valentines.\r\n\r\nToo bad
    the icon doesn't appear below your avatar rather than on it, huh? Just a thought.\r\n\r\nAK"

    pages into one browser view. For the most part, they are bad, and antiquated.
    (see florian's post).\r\n\r\nAs for showing another site within yours, well, that
    is actually the one main reason to use a frame, so yea, go for it. You might want
    to use an iFrame for that.\r\n\r\nThat said, are you SURE you need to trap the
    other site in a frameset? It's fine to just link off to that site. And often much
    preferred by site visitors. Also, external sites can block your ability to load
    their site in a frameset if they so desire.\r\n\r\n"
