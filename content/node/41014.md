  for me.\r\n\r\ni don't even know what you call this type of font, it is a serif
  font, with little swash ball terminals? is that the right way to describe it?\r\n\r\nluckily,
  i can just show you. my guess is that it's an emigre font, but i could of course
  be very wrong!\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/40mercer_4435.jpg]"
