    of italic (slanted) type, e.g. Univers Oblique."

  body: Yeah, I'm not sure if quoting Refused to market these type families is the
    best idea. Maybe you just didn't get the message behind that album?

  body: "Wow. :)\r\n\r\n@ Nick - I know what you think. Maybe. But \"obli\" means
    on Serbian \"rounded\" (he is rounded, male 3rd person) and \"obli\" + \"k\" =
    Oblik = on Serbian means \"Shape\". Even it's not meant to be sold on Serbian
    market, we're still Serbians and we would like also to have our font names sound
    \"readable\" on English and Serbian at the same time, even if they probably can't
    have same meaning on both language. \r\nP.S. - Now we have Italics also :) \r\n\r\n@
    Refused fans - Maybe I didn't, but that's just little play with words.. \"The
    Shape of new Punk to come\" into \"The Shape of new fonts to come\" > Shape =
    Oblik = name of font on Serbian = it doesn't have to be so damn smart or logical,
    it's just what I had in head then and found small similarities between an micro
    foundry and an cult underground band fought for it's values.\r\nCan it go now?
    :)"

  body: "You didn't sound rude.\r\n\r\nWell the whole idea of \"The Shape of Punk
    to Come\" was that \"punk\" of their era was becoming completely mainstream; that
    is, they were defeating the entire idea and purpose of \"punk.\" Their album was
    a step in a different direction in music of their time, especially of that in
    the same genre. I think we both mentioned it because the idea around their title
    was hugely metaphorical and this instance here strips it of that significance.
    :)\r\n\r\nCongrats on the release, btw."
