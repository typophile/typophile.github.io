body: "Hi! :)\r\n\r\nHere is my first approach on type design. It's a friendy sans
  serif font with slightly rounded corners, large x-height and wide lettershapes.
  It's name says it all \u2013 designed to be used for body copy in magazines in around
  10 point size.\r\n\r\nBecause it is supposed to be used in print, it lacks of proper
  hinting (autohinting only actually), so tons of hinting errors may occur. Sorry
  for that. I hope I can improve hinting as soon as I find some advice how to hint
  a font properly. See (or even better print) the pdf for a better view on Brevier
  Ten.\r\n\r\nBrevier Ten features some OpenType functionalities like ligatures, discretional
  ligatures, contextual replacements, lining and old style numbers, caps, historical
  forms and ISO-Latin 1-3 Glyphs.\r\n\r\nDan Reynolds helped me allready A LOT with
  the process of designing this font, so thank you very much, Dan. :)\r\n\r\nI'm really
  looking forward to read your thoughts, critique and suggestions on this! So fire
  at will. ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brevierten_specimen2_3964.jpg]"

    the bottom curve of /e/ needs some redrawing, it isn't flowing nicely.\r\n/w/
    and /W/ are a bit wide.\r\nFlag of /r/ could be a bit bolder.\r\n/m/ could be
    more narrow.\r\nNot sure about the rounded corners on /E/, /F/ and /L/. Somehow
    they don't fit in.\r\nColor of /C/ is too light.\r\nEmphasise the bowl on /D/,
    /P/, /R/.\r\n/s/ leans a bit backward.\r\n\r\n(I'm working on a design myself,

  body: "Hi Jean Paul,\r\n\r\nthanks for your kind words and your feedback. One question
    regarding that: What exactly do you mean with \"Emphasise the bowl on D, P, R\"?\r\n\r\nI'm
    rechecking and tweaking the design a bit now. Round corners from E, F and L stay
    in the font, however. I think they match the overall round-ish feeling of the
    font. Edged alternates are implemented for those who dislike them. \r\n\r\nIn
    addition I started working on a bold version. I'll post an update as soon as it
    is complete."

    you perogative to keep the design as you make it of course. Perhaps make a few
    more characters with rounded corners...? As you say, you'll make alternates. How
    about two fonts in one family, one with rounded corners (all the caps) and one
    with straight corners? Just a thought..."

  body: "Hi David, I'm really not *such* an expert but here are some thoughts. Take
    with a grain of salt, or two :-)\r\nI think this is already quite nice! The texture
    is good and it reads nicely, even in small sizes. Nice degree of character too.
    I hope you have the patience to spend some more time ironing out the little wrinkles
    (zooming in reveals the curves still need work).\r\n\r\nEspecially the lowercase
    reminds me a bit of <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/65841\">Ben's work</a>,
    in terms of its slightly gummy friendliness. One thing I'm not sure about are
    the rounded corners on straight ascenders and descenders. That seems potentially
    gimmicky. I love what that \xABcurvy corner\xBB does on the descender of the \"j\":
    there it quite successfully hints at a curve that isn't actually there. Same in
    the \"q\" maybe (where I'd actually put it the other way round). But in the \"h\"
    etc, it's not supposed to be a curve \u2013 the rounding just seems to be \xABdecoration\xBB?
    Thing is, people may see it as a \xABcurve\xBB there as well \u2013 and then it
    can make the letters look a little backslanted. \r\nBut maybe that's just me.\r\nAlso:\r\n-
    Some of the straight-to-curve transitions, especially on \xABinside\xBB contours,
    are bumpy and jarring, like in the \"u\".\r\n\u2013 \"t\" seems a little unhappy.
    Maybe needs a more stable foot? And/or make it [more] off-vertical.\r\n- I'm not
    sure the shape of the \"a\" is different enough from the \"o\".\r\n\u2013 Diacritics:
    Why is the tilde cut vertically, not perpendicular to the stroke, as with other
    diacritics (see the caron)? Also, I think the ring is too small.\r\n\r\nCaps:
    I enjoy the technoid rounding. But the lowercase feels more coherent; I'm not
    quite sure all caps speak the same (stylistic) language yet. The \"B\" for example
    is bumpy and a bit strange in terms of how it flares its strokes, while other
    caps are very straight and rigid (like the \"E\"). The \"G\" isn't yet sure where
    it's going either. \"W\" is wide. \"J\" is cool, but I'm not sure that corner
    works in the context of your soft, curvy caps. Maybe there *is* a coherent system
    in all this, I'm just not really seeing it right now. :-\\\r\nAlso:\r\n- I like
    the \"R\" a lot, but something with the contrast isn't right \u2013 its right
    side seems much heavier than the stem?\r\n- The \"M\" has quite unconventional
    stress too, is this intentional?\r\n- Bottom-left of the \"U\" (and others) are
    bumpy, see above.\r\n\r\nSmallcaps: I really dig the rounded slightly-stressed
    flavor.\r\n- Are they the exact same height as the lowercase? You *can* make them
    taller \u2013 trust your eye. To me they now look possibly too small.\r\n- Widths
    and spacing might need a little more work.\r\n- I'd make the smallcap \"G\" a
    bit narrower, and possibly lower its crossbar (and maybe make it a bit longer).\r\n-
    Smallcap \"Q\" might benefit from a stronger tail.\r\n\r\nNumerals are very cool!"

  body: "Wow altaira, thank you very much for your detailed feedback! I read it like
    the 5th time and I really enjoy your view on the design! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome questions/thoughts
    on your input:\r\n\r\n- You are absolutly right with the \"curvy corner\" thing
    going on with all the descenders and ascenders. It's more an decorative feature.
    I now think about dropping it and making all the ascenders plain like the \"I\"
    but keeping the curvy corner on \"j\" and maybe even bring it to \"J\", however
    I fear \"J\" would not be distinctive enough then.\r\n\r\n- I'll check contrast
    of \"R\". All curves are ca 10 Units heavier than the verticals for optical compensation.
    Maybe the \"foot\" of \"R\" is optically too heavy, even if its the exact same
    width than all similiar diagonals. And even the width of the vertical stem in
    this case.\r\n\r\n- \"M\" differs in width of the stem from all other capitals,
    indeed. Mainly because I had serious color/texture problems with \"M\" and \"N\".
    So I made their vertical stems 20 units smaller than all other vertical stems
    to get it brighter. And I pulled the outer stems in a slight diagonal position
    get more whitespace on the inside of \"M\". You are right, thats a really bad
    solution, since it's the only character with \"semi diagonal\" stems. I will try
    to redraw them from scratch.\r\n\r\n- The straight-to-curve transitions \u2026
    I have problems to see which are bumpy and which are not but I am sure that is
    because I am such an beginner. :) I will review all the transitions. Do you have
    a hint how I can draw them smother?\r\n\r\n- You are perfectly right on \"B\".
    I will redraw it from cratch. :)\r\n\r\n- \"J\" has a unique descender indeed.
    One of those \"happy little incidents\" i liked and kept. ;) There is no coherent
    system in that, so it is not your fault. :) I will think about what to do there.
    Thanks again for your detailed feedback here! :)\r\n\r\n- Smallcaps are exactly
    the same height as the lowercase. Thats one of the \"coherent ideas\" in this
    font. A lot of aligning heights are shared by different features. Like the height
    of diacritics is also the cap height. Maybe that is too much here. I am not sure
    about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain thank you for your feedback. :)"

  body: "Just this quickly, I'm struggling for time\u2026 \r\nLining things up is
    certainly a very human impulse. :-) One thing about type design though is that
    \u2013 especially in text type, and very especially in text type for smallish
    sizes \u2013, there's much less of a point in actually lining stuff up mathematically.
    It has to look/feel/work right, and for example small caps often look too small
    when they're exactly as tall as the x-height. \r\nIn such cases, I'd say quickly
    trying out 2 or 3 different sizes and trying to see what looks and feels better
    is much superior, as a method, to lining things up and then trusting it <em>needs</em>
    to \xABlook right\xBB, well, because it \xABis right\xBB. :-)\r\nYou'd need to,
    of course, mix words in smallcaps into running text to see how well it works.
    BTW, regarding your sample, I'd strongly advise for ragged-right text setting
    (also linksb\xFCndig/Flattersatz f\xFCr den Lauftext), otherwise it is near impossible
    to see how the spacing and texture of the font really is.\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Thanks for droping by Nina. (:\r\n\r\nYou convinced me. I will do tests with
    height of small caps as soon as I get into near of an laser printer. You are absolutly
    right. Mathematics are most often not the best solution to pick when designing
    a typeface (curves seem thinner, crossed lines broken, overshoot, etc.). I just
    wasn't aware of that optical effect (small caps looking smaller than aimed for).
    I have to admit I spend much more time in the lowercase characters than the small
    caps. Shame on me. ;)\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch for your advice about alignment of
    the specimen. I spend so much time in FontLab and I tend to mess everything up
    because I am not patient enough with actually setting it in InDesign. I just forgot
    (how could I?) that justified text brake up the wordspace.\r\n\r\nNew PDF with
