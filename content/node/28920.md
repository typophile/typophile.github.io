  font based on them. It's a display font with a concept (seeing as I'm still a rookie
  & limitations can be a stimilating asset in the creative process, I find this an
  easy way to learn).\r\nThe concept was to make each character from one single -open;
  for that \"stencil touch\"- line to create a neon-like typeface.\r\nThis is only
  a first draft & I'm not too sure about some characters, but I like how some letters
  seem to be made from a double line (eg. E) & others merely seem to be a contour
  (eg. M).\r\nI know in typography there are some basic rules to follow, but I voluntarely
  chose to neglect them to obtain just a cheap feeling as those rulers. This is only
  my second font & based on this & my first font, legibility doesn't seem to be prior
  on my list, but like I said: it's a display font & an easy way to learn."

    Fenotype's Digital Kauno. Maybe I have a Fenotype fetish I'm not even aware off
    ;-)\r\nThe lowercase though is most likely inspired by those stencil rulers."

    the mixing of single and double lined letters will be very tricky to manage when
    it comes to actual text. You'll need to work with letter adjacency frequencies
    to try to predict/control things.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/5106\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Too late, hrant, the old man is dead ;-)\r\nI'm not sure what you meant with
    your post, but if you're referring to the pragmatic use of the font, I didn't
    really think about that when designing it. I actually kind of like the single
    & double lines when mixed, but then again I have a soft spot for these kind of
    cheap looking things (hence the stencil rulers).\r\nI've designed three display
    fonts so far & I seem to add a little legibility with each new font, but none
    of them would really work in the long run. I just have fun designing them & find
    it an important part of the learning process. There's still a long way to go though..."
