  Of course some agreement would need to be reached over generic tags but really anything

  body: "If your idea includes a nice, thoughtful preview pane and activation, I am
    already drooling at the thought. We poor Windows users are rather out of luck
    as you said. \r\n\r\nI currently use Extensis Suitcase for Windows, which is leaps
    and bounds better than my previous program, MainType. But Suitcase, though functional,
    does seem rather barebones, especially in being locked into the folder methodology
    rather than the more metadata-style approach you are using.\r\n\r\nYou probably
    have already seen it many times, but <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/>MyFonts</a>
    has what seems to be the best tagging system out there, though with so many typefaces
    available, it can be hard to find something really suitable for a query. You might
    want to contact Nick Sherman from MyFonts; he's done some work trying to figure
    out how to organize and classify type, which you can get an overview of <a href=http://www.nicksherman.com/degreeproject/index.html>over
    at his site</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd if, far down the line, you want anyone to test the
    software, look me up   \r\n:-)"

  body: "@auricfuzz \r\nA 'thoughtful' preview pane? please expand on that!\r\n\r\nbut
    yes, something along the lines of extensis suitcase (but with more functionality
    in the classification/grouping/searching) is probably on the cards. (though the
    auto activation plugin stuff might be beyond the time i have available. for me
    just a decent categorisation would be beneficial)\r\n\r\n\"activation\" is easy
    it seems having a look at the APIs. weirdly enough there is no functions for determining
    font names from a file and that's going to have to be hard coded, reading the
    file format.\r\n\r\n@Hallock \r\n\r\n>How will this be different from Linotype
    Font Explorer?\r\n\r\ni won't delete the software from the net :) I've not tried
    it as they pulled it. No dates, no real indication that they are carrying on with
    it, let alone a projected release date. Seriously if me just hacking something
    together forces the hands of one or more other developers then hooray. i just
    can't take looking through loads of fonts or having to manually stick things in
    groups anymore. this kind of software is not rocket science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Right now, Font Explorer isn't for Windows. They did have a Windows Beta version
    out a while back, but it didn't work for me on Vista and they pulled it shortly
    after. But maybe they will release the Windows version for real. Until then...

  body: "The most entirely satisfactory font management experience I have ever had
    was ATM Deluxe on Mac Classic. Perfect auto-activation in all programs, intelligent
    drag and drop, effectively absolutely bug-free, and multiple master handling.
    A rock-solid program you could have total confidence in. The only gotcha was the
    painful initial setup as it dissed your otherwise healthy Bitstream and Monotype
    fonts. There was never anything comparable on OS X. \r\n\r\nATM Deluxe for Windows
    still works on Vista and still provides MM creation. (Just disable UAC -- I think
    this is only necessary temporarily but I disable it permanently as it is such
    a nuisance.) It is not as stupendously elegant as the Mac version and doesn't
    have auto-activation on NT-based versions of Windows, but it does work and it
    appears, even all these years later, and in Vista, for which it was never designed,
    to be, again, absolutely rock-solid, a testament both to the extraordinary care
    and skill that went into its programming and to Microsoft's inflexible and wholly
    benign commitment to backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nI would go even further. ATM
    Deluxe for Mac is the most entirely satisfactory <em>software</em> experience
    I have ever had. The reason is simple: no vital piece of system software was ever
    so reliable or such a simple pleasure to interact with. \r\n\r\nWe users are perpetually
    beleaguered with nervous stress due to buggy software. Can it be surprising that
    software of the calibre of ATM inspires such affection? \r\n\r\nATM's success
    as a program was no accident. Adobe knew from the start that the future of PostScript
    itself depended on ATM's exemption from any visible flaw. Consequently, there
    was probably no programming team that ever worked so hard for perfection. \r\n\r\nATM's
    success as a profitable product is another story. For reasons nobody understands,
    ATM Deluxe did not sell much. The core code (PostScript rendering, but not font
    organization and not auto-activation) had to be given away both to Apple and Microsoft
    because there were never enough paying customers. Adobe had to do this to ensure
    the continued success of PostScript. As extra insurance, the core code is also
    included (as 'Cooltype') in most of Adobe's application products. \r\n\r\nATM
    Deluxe for Mac never developed to the point of characterizing fonts, but it made
    it so easy to do yourself that nobody missed the feature way back when. Were it
    ever to be revived, it would probably need such a feature. \r\n\r\nWhat ATM had
    going for it was trust. T R U S T. You knew it would never mess you up. \r\n\r\nW
    H E N is Adobe going to do it again? W H Y do people get so excited about new
    font managers without ever considering how incredibly difficult it is to write
    something so apparently simple? Why don't they, instead, encourage Adobe to revive
    this most perfect software experience since Adobe is the one company with the
    experience and the personnel to do it right? \r\n\r\nNot that I mean to discourage
    Ian. Maybe open source is the best way forward, maybe it is the only way forward.
    In the meantime, OS companies need to hear that everybody wants auto-activation
    in all programs all the time. This is considered to be a great obstacle in NT+
    and OS X. Who is going to let them know? "
