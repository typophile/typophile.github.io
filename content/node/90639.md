  with a single video with the founder talking about how he isn't going to post a
  profile, list of works, clients, etc....that if you want real design - come to them.
  It is a great video and a great site, sadly, I don't remember what it was or who
  they are...while I was trying to find it I came across some pretty nice sites and
  designers with nice work. I'm interested in hearing who your favorite graphic designers
  or firm is and possibly if anyone knows what i'm talking about with this firm in
  San Fran.\r\nFor now, I really like the work of this guy.\r\nhttp://www.dustinarnold.com/"

    and they would go over their work and portfolio in person. \r\n\r\njames - you
    nailed it. \r\n\r\nin this day and age of \"everyone has a site\", and certainly
    even my grandma can do some great photoshop work in her basement on an old dell,
    whether people say it is arrogant or not i'm sure is of no concern as these people
    aren't in their demographic. \r\nhonestly, for me it was one of the best, if not
    THE best website for a designer. It really struck me. I've been a designer for
    15 years and I don't have a site, nor do I carry a portfolio. The reason is the
    same reason - it is far too limiting. When I speak to a client I meet in person
    and put together a portfolio specifically catered to their needs...so with that
    being said, there is absolutely nothing arrogant about it.\r\n\r\n"

    meetings, a review of their previous work, written proposals and estimates, and
    so forth.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen the video myself, but I'm guessing that the design
    firm targets and goes after potential clients that they desire, rather than just
    putting up a site and hoping it'll attract someone, and therefore they regard
    the website as largely a waste of resources.\r\n\r\nA design firm I used to work
    for had a similar attitude. They did almost no advertising. The decided who they

    <em>IF</em> that's true, I feel 'real' sad for the rest of us 'unreal' graphic
    designers and graphic design firm owners.\r\n\r\nAs to your 'real' question ...
    I appreciate designers (and design firms) that have an edge to their work and
    have the innate ability to push their craft/art forward with the tools that they
    use. It could be something slick as done by Neil Duerden, or something raw as
    done by Eric Haze. There's far too many for me to mention like Ian Brignell, the
    firm Non-Format, um ... \r\n\r\nBut say something like \"...if you want real design
    - come to them.\", is just plain ignorant."

    normally an executive at the design firm would go to the potential client's office.
    Even if it means flying across the country. \r\n\r\nLanding a big account can
    means hundreds of thousands of dollars in billing, so it's worth spending some
    money to land the account.\r\n\r\nAt the design firm I previously mentioned working
    at, we had a Vice President for Marketing (although he used a different title
    on his business card so it didn't sound overly commercial). His only job was landing
    new clients, and he was constantly traveling, showing the portfolio, wining and
    dining executives at companies we wanted to work for, etc.  \r\n\r\n"
