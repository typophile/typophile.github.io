  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was wondering if I could get some input on a couple distribution models. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Myself and two friends spend way too much time designing type, for fun, for our various projects, for camaraderie and for the journey, not necessarily the destination. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We would like to distribute our work (mostly display stuff) ourselves. The problem is the current state of type protection and the mentality of most people who think that type (even the best quality of type) should be free or next to free. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We surely don't want to charge $40 a font. But we don't want to give our stuff away either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So we were toying with some different ideas. Here's one approach: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) We charge a nominal fee $2.00 or $3.00 for users to obtain a password to enter our download area. The password would change every day.  Once the fee was paid, a person could download every font in the download area up to that point. Every time a new font was made available for download, then previous 'customers' would have to pay the nominal fee to get all the new fonts up to that point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) The trick is to get the tens of thousands of people who expect everything for free to pay something. You'd have to entice them with original fonts made available on a regular basis. Do pirates and freeware users have $3.00 to spare? We don't know. If we proceed with some form of this model, we would find out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) We would also offer special stuff (packages that we put way more time into) off to the side for 'normal retail' prices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) We are not as much concerned with the brand as we are with these facts: 1) we are making type 2) we are using our type 3) we'd like others to have the opportunity to use it 4) we don't want to give it away, on general principle and because we'd like to at least pay for the bandwith. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple problems: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Sharing of passwords. Maybe dynamic passwords are possible? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Charging so little conveys a lack of worth to 'regular font buyers'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) If a customer entered the download section at the end of a 'time period', they would get EVERY font for the nominal fee. If a customer entered at the beginning of the period, they would only get a couple fonts for their nominal fee. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) E-commerce backbone. Can we devise a system (similar to Amazon's Honor System) that let's people get in and get out without a lot of buttons to push. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) How hardcore is this backlash against type being overpriced. If people in this forum think type at $40 is too much, what are we to think of the general public or Joe Graphic Designer? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What SHOULD a font be priced at? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any feedback would be appreciated. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody">(I think you're on the same mental train as I am with honorware.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; We charge a nominal fee $2.00 or $3.00 for users to obtain a password &hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds like an interesting basic idea, but does that mean you're charging $2-3 dollars for a cartload of fonts? I don't get it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The trick is to get the tens of thousands of people who expect everything for free to pay something. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And don't forget poor-but-honest people who would pay good money for fonts, but simply can't afford/justify it: they should be able to pay *something* and get it. Not just to be nice, but because if you say &quot;gimme $100 or get lost&quot;, you've just created a pirate, and an enemy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; You'd have to entice them with original fonts made available on a regular basis. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note Chank's &quot;Font-of-the-month Club&quot;: $100/year, right? And who was saying that he has ~200 members? Not bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; we'd like others to have the opportunity to use it <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, not least because exposure is a huge marketing advantage. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Sharing of passwords. Maybe dynamic passwords are possible?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe. But don't fret over that too much anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Charging so little conveys a lack of worth to 'regular font buyers'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Amazon's Honor System <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What's that? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; How hardcore is this backlash against type being overpriced. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not really &quot;backlash&quot;, but if you try to sell people something for too much money, they'll just sacrifice another little grain of ethics (that's all font piracy really takes away from a person, a grain of ethics) to get the font. So the price of a font should be a grain or a boulder, depending on many things that are usually accounted for (like the quality of the font), but also many things that are not, like the wealth of individual customers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Example: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Traffic fines in Finland are based partly on income, and the record fine (which was recently levied on an Internet millionaire) was over $100,000&hellip; for going [the equivalent of] 45 mph in a 30 mph zone&hellip; on a motorcycle!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; What SHOULD a font be priced at? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A combination of three things: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. What the designer wants to charge for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. What the market wants the price to be. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. What the customer can justify to himself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the current commercialware world, it's too much of #1, not enough of #3, and -most significantly- *nothing* from #3, the most important one (considering piracy is so easy and widespread/accepted). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BJ, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't see any good reasons for selling all  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your fonts for a flat fee of $2. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, in general terms, what you're talking  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about sounds similar to the yearly 'pass' that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miniml offers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.miniml.com">http://www.miniml.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Except it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sounds like they will offer at least 12 fonts  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->during the one year 'membership.' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because your faces are one-offs of the display  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sort, perhaps you should consider bundling  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->them. If a buyer can't justify $10 or $12 for a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one-off, display face, perhaps they'd be more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eager to buy a pack of fonts for $25 or $30.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Those prices are just for illustration.)

		<div class="commentbody">Joe and Hrant, thanks for the feeback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, packages are the old standby I suppose, used by Fonthead and FontDiner, among others. It seems evident that Ethan and Stu have been successful with that method. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am a customer at both places, and I was enticed by 1 or 2 fonts in a package and I bought a set. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would guess that that method would be the safest, and maybe we'll go that way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still, we are curious about enticing the middle of the bell curve &ndash; the users who have never paid a penny for a font yet have thousands on their hard drive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's like honorware: You'd hope people could chip in a little bit, at least enough to make themselves feel good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But maybe I'm expecting too much from people who get their fonts handed to them on a silver platter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bj <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
