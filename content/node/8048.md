  body: Do u think I can directly ask the Designers of these fonts if I can use them,
    telling them I am going to mention their name and/or foundries as well as font
    names? <BR>Do you think I can do that, or that&#39;s totally ridiculous? <BR>

  body: Hey, I have a similar question.. I&#39;m doing this poster, and the client
    requested DIN &#39;or something similar&#39;. I&#39;ve tried DIN and it looks
    pretty sweet, but it&#39;s <i>so</i> incredibly overused right now to the point
    of being ridiculous. <BR> <BR>It looks like I&#39;ll be using the uppercase letters
    only. Any suggestions? Oh, and I would be willing to make a purchase. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    by moderator] look too similar &#40;for not to say identical&#41; to Spiekermann&#39;s
    ITC Officina Sans? <BR> <BR>Ain&#39;t it somewhat illegal? But as long as this
    rip is up there we have to admit that it&#39;s still possible to find decent type
    from there...
