  but I think I'll try this anyway. I haven't posted here before, but I've found lots
  of great advise on these forums.\r\n\r\nI'm designing a literary magazine, and we're
  in search of a bit of renewal. I've been designing it a few years, and since the
  beginning of 2007 we've been using [[http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=196|Tribute]]
  for the titles, and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/bembo_book_pro_vp/|Bembo
  Book]] for the text. We're not really dissatisfied with this, but Tribute has a
  few downsides. It's not really a display typeface, it's actually made to work well
  at rather small sizes. We are/were aware of this. But it's a typeface with a big,
  quirky personality, with lots of swashes, ligatures and extras. After two years,
  though, I've grown really tired of it, and I'm looking for a replacement, or replacements.
  The problem is that most of the typefaces I try look quite feeble next to this strange
  half-parody. Now, I'm not going to set the new typeface alongside the old, of course,
  but the new look shouldn't be weaker than the old. \r\n\r\nIs there something out
  there as idiosyncratic and bizarre - and at the same time classic - as Tribute?
  \r\n\r\nMaybe not. Maybe we should just try something completely different. But
  these specs remain:\r\n- Should be a seriffed face\r\n- Needs to work at large point
  sizes (30 - 120 or so)\r\n- Should have both oldstyle and lining figures, and small
  caps\r\n- Lots of ligatures and swashes and other interesting details don't hurt
  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor some other jobs I've been using typefaces with display cuts, like
  Warnock and Arno Pro, I really love both of them. But this magazine just needs something
  else. I am considering swiching from Bembo Book to Arno Pro for the text, though
  - that's another story, but I'm also open for suggestions on good workhorses for
  text, with interesting display companions. \r\n\r\nSome more details: The magazine
  is Norwegian, it's called Vagant, and is one of about two leading literary magazines
  in the country. It has a combination of academic articles and literary texts, and
  illustrations by invited artists. [[http://www.vagant.no|Homepage]] The format is
  w210xh280, usually 130-160 pages, 4 issues pr year."

    not a display face, but has some of the liveliness of Tribute.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions! I find both Odile and Leitura appealing, but
    I'm not sure they'll quite fit the bill.\r\n\r\nMy editor suggested that I could
    put up a link to the pdf of the latest issue, in case someone's interested, for
    a limited amount of time: \r\n\r\n[[http://gasspedal.org/Vagant/vagant0408.pdf|Here
    it is]]. (Pdf, 9 mb size)\r\n\r\nIf you look at it you'll notice I've been playing
    a bit with the letterforms of Tribute, to make the drop caps. These were made
    especially for this issue, not a permanent thing. It's a bit over the top really."

    the redesign, but have you checked to make sure that your <strong>readers</strong>
    haven't grown tired of it? With only 4 issues per year, the readers might just
    now be starting to warm up to your design, despite the fact that you've grown
    tired of it.\r\n\r\nOften, a designer will stare at the same typeface in the same
    designs for hours of time over many days and months. Of course it is going to
    not feel fresh to you after 2 years, but always remember that your reader's experience
    of the typeface is much different than your own.\r\n\r\nAs to a suggestion, I
    love FF Clifford. Or perhaps FF Oneleigh.\r\n\r\n"
