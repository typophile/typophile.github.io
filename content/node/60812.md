body: "A colleague of mine faces a problem with importing vietnamese text into InDesign:
  a couple of characters fail to get displayed correctly. A quick test of applying
  different Pro-fonts on the text reveals that with each of them a different selection
  and number (!) of ch.s submarine.\r\nOn the other hand, the same text performes
  perfectly well in e.g. Apples MAIL or TEXTEDIT.\r\nSee this view of Indesign (top)
  and Textedit (bottom), text file and font *are the same*:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Has anyone
  a clue?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vietn_4853.jpg]"

  body: "The support for mark-to-base (to position a single accent character to its
    base letter) and mark-to-mark (to position multiple accents relative to eachother)
    differs from one application to another. Pre-CS4, InDesign did not support it
    (at all, or correctly); CS4 should finally support it in full. That's from hearsay,
    by the way.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible Textedit doesn't <em>need</em> the Opentype
    definitions and can simulate the compositions just by having the right glyphs
    in the font."

    In any case, the InDesign problem displays as .notdef glyphs, indicating that
    the program is confused about the underlying characters.\r\n\r\nAndreas, do you
    know what method your colleague is using to import the text?"

  body: "I think it would be a bad thing if InDesign started to do font fallback.
    Font fallback is highly desirable in environments where the content (i.e. the
    data/information) is more important than its form (i.e. the design/typography).
    So I'd argue that, being InDesign a professional typesetting tool, it's very important
    to get typographic fidelity and therefore having things like font fallback and
    faux styles is undesirable*.\r\n\r\n* (Even the faux small caps that InDesign
    already allows is sort of an heresy for Type geeks)"

    glyph missing? It's what I do now manually: check a font for missing glyphs, find
    a replacement font, create character style for it and apply that to the missing

    existing fonts is an option, but\r\n\r\n- it takes a lot of time and effort\r\n-
    you might break existing structures in the font, such as kerning and opentype
    features\r\n- you end up with a unique font you cannot legally distribute -- thus,
    you can't send any of the original files you used it in to someone else.\r\n\r\nHow
    does the virtual font system I imagine compare to that?\r\n\r\n- For any character
    not in font <em>f</em>, you should be able to specify an alternate glyph <em>g</em>
    from another font. Somewhere in the InDesign Glyph panel -- browse & click.\r\n-
    The program (InDesign, preferable) handles the replacement of glyphs; the fonts
    themselves are not touched.\r\n- It's just a data table somewhere in the document;
    yes, anyone else using your original documents should have the same fonts, but
    this is already a (reasonable) requirement."
