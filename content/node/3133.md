  body: If you only need to transfer the outlines, generate a PC Type 1 font from
    Fontographer &#40;make sure to enable AFM and INF file generation&#41;, and open
    the resulting PFB file in FontLab.  <BR>If you need to transfer outlines and bitmaps
    created in Fontographer, you need FontLab and BitFonter. Generate a Macintosh
    Type 1 suitcase from Fontographer, open the suitcase/.bmap file &#40;not the printer
    file&#41; in FontLab to import outlines, and open the same suitcase in BitFonter
    to import the bitmaps.  <BR>After you have finished editing your font in FontLab,
    you can output it as Macintosh Type 1 suitcase, or Windows TrueType &#40;these
    are the two font formats that support embedded bitmaps, although not in MacOS
    X&#41;, and then add the bitmaps to these results using BitFonter.  <BR>Adam Twardoch,
