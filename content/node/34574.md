  body: "Thanks. I looked up these faces and found the most obvious difference in
    the apostrophe, but the sample I originally posted may be borrowing an apostrophe
    from another font. Another obvious difference is the treatment of the R. And overall
    they each have nuances that distinguish themselves.\r\n\r\nHellenic Wide (Veer):

    at them, the more I think none of these is exactly the face in the original sample,
    but they generally very close."

  body: "Where does your sample come from? How old is it?\r\nIf it\u2019s from pre-digital
    times there might be no EXACT match.\r\nThe apostrophe may be a fake/wrong one
    (bad typesetting)."

    the 90's, but the apostrophe looks like the Veer (Jukebox) sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike
