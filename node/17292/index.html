I'm looking at a 1992 first edition and a 1999 revised second edition right now. The second edition is a hundred pages longer, so I'd say it's obvious there are significant differences (or at least additions) between those two.

The revised second edition has about 40 pages that have corrections or additions compared to the regular second edition.

I think that the current version is actually "edition 2.5" as of 2002 or so, and has moderate noticeable changes compared to the second edition, mostly in areas that have to do with things that have changed due to technical advances (e.g. OpenType). However, my most recent copy is at work, so I can't check easily.

Are you sure that your version isn't 3.1? I have 3.1 on my desk with changes to the same pages and a copyright date in 2005.

Thanks for clearing up that doubt, eston. I could have sworn I saw a copy of the 3.1 edition in a store a couple of weeks ago, but could not find any reference to it online when reading this thread. The funny thing is that only a few days later, I saw a hardcover copy of the 3.0 edition in another store -- very perplexing!

Well, if it makes you feel any better, I just read through the first 65 pages of my v3.1 today. For the entire first chapter, only every other set of pages (one side of each piece of paper) is printed. Oddly enough, you'd expect the same near the end of the book, but it doesn't seem to be the case.

Oh, the irony in having a defectively-printed version of a book about typography. I'm not returning it, either. :)


<em>Is this a new trend, and is it really necessary?</em>

Considering that Bringhurst cites Strunk and White as his inspiration for <em>ETS</em>, maybe he's just trying to keep up with S&W's publishers. I've still got my old copy of the Elements of Style. I personally find the illustrated edition to be rather <em>un</em>necessary.</div>

That's because the book is comprised of a series of 32-page <em>signatures</em>. Look at the top or bottom of the book, near the spine, and you will see the signatures and how they fold. Or, open up the book at pages 16-17 (or 48-49) and look at the spread's gutter: you will see the sewing that keeps those 32 pages together. (I have a copy of version 2.4 here, and it is made up of 11 signatures.)</div>
