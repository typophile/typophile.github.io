body: I&#39;m wanting to make a banner that will go with the fonts used in the maps
  that we just purchased here at work. I&#39;ve tried using the following links to
  find this out on my own, but I&#39;ve come up short in my searches. Any help is
  greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/fontidentifier.html"

  target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/</a> <BR> <BR>Text that is used
  on the bottom center of the map at <a href="http://www.ngmapstore.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=177&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=6&amp;iSubCat=46&amp;iProductID=177"

  <BR> <BR>Another example of this font in question is seen <a href="http://www.ngmapstore.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=157&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=6&amp;iSubCat=47&amp;iProductID=157"

  <BR> <BR>The final example is <a href="http://www.ngmapstore.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=402&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=6&amp;iSubCat=44&amp;iProductID=402"

  <BR> <BR>I also have done the zoom in feature and captured the 3 examples of this
  unknown font. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.geocities.com/gothmilk_indy/the_world.txt"

  body: Here&#39;s a showing of the <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=229"
    target="_blank">complete Harbour font</a>, which I realize is only similar in
    certain letterform &#39;skeletons&#39;. I could easily imagine the National Geographic
    font being a member of the same family as Harbour, called &#39;Seaport&#39;, or
    &#39;Dock&#39; &#40;just kidding&#41;. <BR> <BR>I did look through all the other
    Gareth Hague fonts I could see, but nothing was  closer. <BR> <BR>This was a recent
    question I thought. Was it a custom Geographic font?

  body: I have no idea if National Geographic has their own line of fonts. I don&#39;t
    know if this is a commercial font, or if it is something that only NG keeps hidden
    away in their graphics dept. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for the help!

    <BR> <BR>Very often they do not. I like to play font-spotting with their title
    fonts for each story.
