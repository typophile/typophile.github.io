  a lot of designers who teach typography focus on designing with letterforms and
  not really explain how to develop more practical things such as designing traffic
  tickets or math formulae.\r\n\r\nShould these kind of projects be included in a
  beginning type class or should another class be developed to cover things like tables,
  math, train schedules, and phonebooks?\r\n\r\nAt what point should a type student
  try his hand at designing a typeface?\r\n"

    dedicated to typography, so most become general guidelines for type usage.\r\n\r\nOut
    of practicality, graphic design students today are caught in a barrage of various
    topics, techniques and disciplines regarding design, software programs, pre-production
    methods, and so on, so in reality no single area of knowledge is \"complete.\"\r\n\r\nI
    do apologize that I must divert my attention to something else at the moment,
    but I will revisit the topic again. Others in this forum are currently involved
    with the same issues you are raising."

  body: "A millennium ago when I was in design school, we did typography projects
    including order forms, Annual Report tables, charts as well as the usual page
    layout stuff.  This was before computers so it was a different world without the
    instant feed back postscript gives you.\r\nToday, it is rare to see young designers
    fresh out of school who can set decent running text without bad rag or hyphenation
    gone mad.  I wish design schools would begin teaching the practical parts of typography
    including tables and subhead series so that kids getting out of school would have
    a marketable skill to help them get in the door. Employers want to hire people
    who can hit the ground running.  All the typographic skills are NEEDED on the
    ground.  The fun typographic play is sweet and also needed but don't forget the
    meat and potatoes to go with that desert.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "i hate to say it, but choice is the problem.\r\n\r\ni always thought it would
    be useful to create an assignment where the student is only allowed to use Courier
    to create a complex layout that incudes headlines, subheads, body text, captions
    and couple of charts and tables (or whatever). this would force the student to
    excercise the skill to arrange the type so that it works. \r\n\r\nthe idea is
    to remove the font from the equation, therby placing an emphasis on \r\n\"working
    it\". the absence of a good typeface of one's own choice would also allow a student
    to understand why it is important to work with a good font family (with good spacing!),
    and some of the problems one might run into when the type palette is limited.\r\n\r\nthis
    might actually lead to \"damn, i wish i had those small caps!\" or other interesting
    discussions that stem from these types of limitations. \r\n\r\nin general, i think
    a possible solution might have to do with eliminating some of the overwhelming
    choice that students have today in order to let them focus on some of the basics.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n::nc"

  body: "In the first type class I ever took, the very first assignment was kerning.
    I had to cut out the individual letters in a word and manually space them out.
    The assignment kind of drove some people up the wall because we knew nothing about
    type at the time and this introduction felt really technical and mundane.\r\n\r\nBut
    the assignments that followed were more creative and focused on letterforms. I
    think it was at this time that people began to like type. Simultaneously in other
    classes, there were assignments that had practical application and used a lot
    of type in things like tables and brochures. I think the mix of the two classes
    together made a lightbulb go off for many people, and they really began to understand
    type. This duality seems to work, so yes, I think there should be another class
    to cover all the practical bases."

    that came to mind after thinking over this topic thread and have found that for
    me, developing a \"keen\" vision for letterforms and the ability to self-evaluate
    one's work will open the door to finding practical solutions using type. Finding
    ways to bring students through this threshold is the real question at hand.\r\n\r\nI've
    spun of another topic on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/15844\">more ponderings
    on type education</a>."

  body: "One thing that is no longer taught is charachter counts, this was a must
    in a pre-postscript environment. Most type houses carried specimens that had guages
    at the bottom of the page for copy to be set at size/pica length. Size, leading,
    line length, headlines all had to be thought out first. Too small a font size
    and your copy just stopped, to large and even worse you had overruns. It is incredibly
    difficult and time consuming to do, so many designers had knowledge of a few fonts
    and used them, compared to now where most designers use whatever and never get
    to know a font.\r\n\r\nI used set type for a famous designer years ago, and upon
    a chance meeting he said \"they (his design support staff) don't even know what
    leading is and I do not have the time to fight them\u2026\"\r\n\r\nRodi"

  body: "> <em>Size, leading, line length, headlines all had to be thought out first.</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    totally agreed. In pre-Postscript days (or more acurately, Pre-Desktop Publishing
    days), type-specing and copyfitting were both costly (if you sent out for typesetting)
    and time consuming (even if you had your own typesetting equipment). This necessitated
    accurate pre-planning and preparation of layouts as they went into production.\r\n\r\nA
    lot of calculation AND visualization took place. With the use of type specimen
    sheets, character count tables, type gauges and a calculator, designers/typographers
    had to completely envision the end result prior to full production. \"Seeing\"
    the end result of typesetting prior to the actual hard-copy developed awareness
    and sensitivity to type, what it was and had it had to be used.\r\n\r\nType selection
    and copyfitting via \"menu-options\" allows for a great amount of \"fudging-around\"
    and often leads to responses like, \"<em>Hmmm, it all fits and looks fine enough.</em>\"
    or \"<em>If I open the line spacing by another point, the copy will fit the page.\"</em>\r\n\r\nIf
    building a page or project can be quickly and efficiently done, the need for designers
    to be versed in the <em>Black Arts</em> (an old print term that has completely
    lost its meaning) is very little.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't believe final output is
    being as closely scrutinized by as many project team members either. In our shop
    the copywriter, typographer and creative manager had to sign-off on all typesetting
    prior to printing."
