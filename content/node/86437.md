  body: "Well, there are <em>languages</em>, and then there are <em>writing systems</em>.\r\n\r\nThe
    question of the relationship between a language and its writing system is generally
    dealt with in connection with linguistics (although the tendency is to view linguistics
    proper as dealing only with the spoken language).\r\n\r\nThe relationship between
    alphabetic scripts, abugidas, and syllabaries and their languages, though, is
    <em>usually</em> almost trivial. Syllabaries may reinforce the limitation of a
    language to a fixed set of syllables, and an imperfect orthography, like that
    of English, may end up changing how some words are pronounced if people see them
    written more than they hear them spoken.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese writing system probably
    <em>has</em> had some effect on Chinese speech, by infusing its individual syllables
    with meaning.\r\n\r\nAs for typography, the goal is to match the writing system
    as closely as possible. Technical limitations of typography sometimes have affected
    the writing system. Thus, Ethiopian writing was modified so that it could be reproduced
    on a conventional typewriter. While Nakshi can be reproduced reasonably well using
    \"simplified Arabic\" with two, rather than four, forms of each letter, the form
    of Arabic script still preferred in Pakistan - Nastaliq - is difficult to reproduce
    even with a computer - and there has been some discussion of that in these forums."
