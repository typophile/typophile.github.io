body: "Unger Fraktur was not designed by [[Gerard Unger]], but rather by [[Johann
  Friedrich Unger]] in 1793. Unger Fraktur is an attempt at a Didone-style Fraktur.
  It is a quite successful attempt, too. Many of the \"superfluous\" decorative elements
  of [[Fraktur]] letters have been removed, without sacrificing feel or legibility.\r\n\r\nA
  digital version of the design is available from Berthold."
