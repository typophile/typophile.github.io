  body: "James, I presume you're within reach of a library? Because you could always
    go and borrow <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wolfgang-Weingart-My-Way-Typography/dp/390704486X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5481549-6053713?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176271846&sr=1-1\">his
    book...</a>\r\n\r\nThere's also quite a lot of Weingart in person in <a href=\"http://www.typecastfilm.com/index.htm\">Kathryn
    Cho's documentary movie 'Typecast'.</a> But I understand it's the work you're
    looking for, rather than the man."
