  body: 'i think there are one or two pixel faces that are quite similar to this.
    I like it at 12pt because there are some wonderful characters, especially the
    &#39;E&#39;. However, at 6pt, B, E, G, and Q all look too similar, I reckon that
    would destroy legibility.  '

  body: Hi Dmitry, <BR> <BR>I like it. Ok, it looks like something I saw before but
    still it has something of its own. <BR>I like the feeling of an italic that is
    not an italic. Maybe you should use that a little more. If I look for the S and
    Z, they are for me to much upright. Perhaps they should also lean a little to
    the right like het A, B, E, F, P, R, etc. <BR> <BR>I can immagine how hard it
    must be to make something original. Seeing the fact that it are pixels. You have
    only so much of them. <BR> <BR>Keep it up. <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: I like where you&#39;re going, but it feels like you&#39;re trying to fit
    things to rigidly to a formula. <BR> <BR>In your nickname &#40;taran80&#41;, I
    read the 8 as a B &#40;taranb0&#41;. 8, B, and Q all look like Bs to me. <BR>
    <BR>I think you should pull in the sides on the 8 &#40;eliminate 1 pixel on each
    side of the crossbar you have now&#41;. Try a vertical tail on the Q. At 6 px,
    you&#39;re going to have to occasionally compromise the pureness of your design
    in favor of legibility.
