<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I don't know if this is a FontLab (5.0) problem, or an InDesign (CS2) problem (both in Windows), so I thought I'd try here.
Made up an OpenType font. In the "embedding" window, I selected "embedding is not allowed". Made sure the "subsetting" box was not checked. Generated an .otf OpenType font & put it in the InDesign font folder. Created a new document, the font worked fine, displayed on the screen, and printed out from within InDesign.
So I thought I'd try to export the document to a PDF file from within InDesign. That worked too. And when I looked at the properties of the PDF file, the font was subsetted.
I opened both the VFB and the OFT files. The VFB was as it should be, embedding not allowed, no check in the subsetting box. But the OTF was different, the allow subsetting box was now checked. Doesn't seem to be anything in the Options > generate OpenType that would have caused this.
Any clues as to what is going on? Can we make fonts where embedding is not allowed & InDesign CS2 won't subset the fonts in a PDF?
Thanks in advance</div>

<div class=commentbody>The actual bits in the font are such that a bit is turned *on* to NOT allow subsetting. If you're not allowing embedding in the first place, there's no reason to toggle that bit on. So I wouldn't worry about that part. The question is, was the OTF properly set to no embedding?
Could you have a problem with caching of an older version of the font that did not have the same embedding bits?

Well, maybe. In the "names & copyright" box of FontLab, I kept the family name the same, but changed the style name to "book-restricted", then used the "build names" button. On the subsheet, "OpenType specific names," I used the "Build OpenType Names" button. On the subsheet "Additional OpenType Names," I clicked on the red "X" which is the reset button. In the past, this has always gotten the names right.
Then on the "embedding" subsheet, I selected "Embedding of this font is not allowed."
Since I don't really know just how it works, I also hit "Apply" on each subsheet & then OK'd the main sheet. And the OTF file generated, when re-opened in FontLab did show "embedding of this font is not allowed."
As to the fonts themselves, we store fonts in:
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe InDesign CS2\Fonts
rather than in C:\Windows\Fonts,
so I don't really see how a conflict would arise -- the program will check the \Adobe InDesign CS2\Fonts location first, right? And the new font was in that folder, had a different name, and InDesign found it just fine. This routine has always worked before when developing OTF fonts (I usually have a few versions before I get things right), except I've never tried to prevent embedding before.
What I'm really after here comes about because we are going to set a book where the designer (book designer) wants to take our InDesign files and then place the images. The InDesign files will go back & forth, so fonts will go back & forth as well. I don't want to give the designer copies of our fonts that they can then use for other work, so I figured if I used fonts where embedding wasn't allowed, then switched them to the same font where embedding was allowed just before making the PDF that went off to the printer, all would be well.</div>
