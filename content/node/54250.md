  Balla's Street Light ^^^\r\nGiacomo Balla was one of the founding members of the
  first Futurist painters. Futurism is a modern art movement originating among Italian
  artists in 1909, when Filippo Marinetti's first manifesto of futurism appeared,
  until the end of World War I.\r\nFuturism was a celebration of the machine age,
  glorifying war and favoring the growth of fascism. Futurist painting and sculpture
  were especially concerned with expressing movement and the dynamics of natural and
  man-made forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/costructivism_6530.jpg]\r\nVladimir
  Tatlin - Monument to the Third International - 1919-20 ^^^\r\nRussian Constructivism
  was a movement that was active from 1913 to the 1940s. It was a movement created
  by the Russian avant-garde, but quickly spread to the rest of the continent. Constructivist
  art is committed to complete abstraction with a devotion to modernity, where themes
  are often geometric, experimental and rarely emotional.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/expressionism_4741.jpg]\r\nEdvard
  Munch- The Scream 1893 ^^^\r\nMunch was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose
  intensely psychological and emotional themes was a major influence on the development
  of German Expressionism in the early 20th century. His painting The Scream is regarded
  as an icon of the existential anguish of the post-industrial modern age. It may
  have been partly inspired by the raw quality of African tribal art. This painting
  has always stood out to me because its full of emotion."
