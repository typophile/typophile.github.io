  body: It looks very Doyald Young, except there are some weaknesses &#40;like the
    color difference between the two words&#41;. And it&#39;s most probably handmade
    &#40;not a font&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Both &#39;n&#39;s are different. Probably calligraphy, like  <BR>the man said.

  body: 'On the <i>other</i> hand, now that you mention the &#34;n&#34;s, notice that
    the second &#34;n&#34; is malformed, while the first one &#40;and every other
    glyph&#41; is fine... So now I think maybe it <i>is</i> a font, and only that
    terminal &#34;n&#34; is a custom &#40;and bad&#41; mod job. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;m
    also getting a bell ringing: That &#34;G&#34; especially reminds me a lot of Michael
    Harvey&#39;s recent Tisdall font &#40;of which I don&#39;t have a sample handy&#41;.

  body: I&#39;m interested to see the answer for this one, but I can see it isn&#39;t
    Michael Harvey&#39;s &#34;Tisdall Script&#34; &#40;see <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?BZ"
    target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/show?BZ</a> for a sample showing&#41;.   <BR>
    <BR>It doesn&#39;t look like anything in my Script Guide either, which is why
    I&#39;d like to know what it is.

  body: This looks to me like it actually might be a font, not  <BR>calligraphy. If
    it is handmade, then it was done digitally,  <BR>not as actual hand-done lettering.
    I say this based on  <BR>the consistency of the arches of u and y, the bowls of
    a  <BR>and d, and the two r&#39;s. The difference in color between  <BR>the two
    words is the result of enlarging a single master.

    someone did for them once. Seems like a plausable explanation to me.

    in bike on a rural city. <BR> <BR>i never forger a face. <BR>and this is a font,
    is not a simple calligraphy. <BR> <BR>no one will win.
