  is an original and special blog where their contributors try to deal with typographic
  and graphic design topics. Their aim is to help graphic designers to forget their
  fears and start working on types. \r\nTypies is a very didactic blog, and the topics
  it deals with, are unusually mentioned on typographic books. You will note that
  the information in this blog is very useful and easy to understand.\r\nIdeal for
  newer typographic designers.\r\n.\r\nhttp://typies.blogspot.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n."
