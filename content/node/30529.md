body: "I am currently designing a book based on Baskerville for a graphic design project
  at Uni. The book has to link to Baskerville in its format and layout grids. So the
  book doesnt necassarily have to be your standard book with a cover and pages it
  can be of any creative nature but link to baskerville.\r\n\r\nMy idea was a book
  of stamps showing the transitional features or the Baskerville typeface, but im
  having problem linking a stamp book directly to Baskerville.\r\n\r\nI'm in need
  some examples of grids and layouts that link to Baskerville's printed works, all
  the ones I can find are wide margined and very large books such as the bible. Has
  anyone got any examples of smaller books or different work?\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts
  welcome aswell.\r\n\r\nThanks Simon Moore"

  body: "I own a 2-volume set of the Milton, the 1759 edition. The bindings are clearly
    very old but I'm not at all sure that they are original. Owner's name on endpaper
    includes the date 1806. I'm mentioning this simply because the trim size of my
    two books may have grown smaller in the rebinding, if they were indeed rebound.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, trim is 7-1/8\" x 9-1/2\" (182 x 242 mm) upright. The type page is 25x42
    picas (4-1/8\" x 7\" / 105 x 177 mm). Margins are: head, 5p6; tail, 9p; inner,
    6p6; outer, 11p. Type is set 14/17.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of some help. They are
    beautifully designed and printed books with consistent type color from one page
    to the next, never overinked, and although the paper is foxed it feels as strong
    and healthy as it must have 250 years ago!\r\n\r\n[edit] In case this is of any
    value to your collection of data, the edition I own was printed by Baskerville
    for J. and R. Tonson, London."
