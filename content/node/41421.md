    cool and it spoils the reading. Books like <em>Thinking With Type</em> where images
    and footnotes are popping out all over the place, creating a series of segues
    that make it impossible to just focus and read the text, drive me nuts. \r\n\r\nBut
    I also know a lot of designers who look on such books in the same way Scientologists
    see <em>Dianetics</em>. In a field where people are visually inclined, a little
    nutty, and \u201Clearning disabilities\u201D like ADHD and dyslexia abound, it\u2019s
    probably good that there are alternatives to books by Robert Bringhurst and Harry
    Carter."

    good type... I would hardly call it irritating to read.

    for comfortable reading, or with careless typesetting... that sort of thing.

  body: "I think, overly \"precious\" typesetting, usually too small, and, as if playing
    self consciously to an audience. : \"Hey, look! I'm really good, huh?\" The book
    that set me off was set something the looked like 6 point compressed Helvetica
    light to my poor overworked eyes. I left the microscope at the office.\r\n\r\nOften
    when I'm \"reading\" a design book, I am really just looking at the pictures and
    scanning the text in the briefest way possible. (that's how come I knows so much)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: Ok, now I see what you mean. Yeah, those books irritate me too, right up there
    with the design annuals full of images the size of postage stamps, with captions
    arranged elsewhere on the page in a way that only barely coordinates with the
    arrangement of the images.

  body: "The worst design annual I ever saw was one of the AIGA 50 Books/50 Covers
    about 10 years back in which they photographed the books in a way you would never
    treat a book you care about - lying splayed open, viewed from the top. I'm having
    trouble describing this but it felt - to me - very disrespectful of books as objects.
    Then they shot the interior pages from weird angles, cropped and such. Again,
    disrespectful to the designers and totally useless as a resource. I wrote to complain
    which means they will never give me an award again (not that they do anyway since
    I let my membership go).\r\n"

  body: The most irritating book on design I've found is "The Complete Manual of Typography"
    by James Felici. The advice within ranges from good to questionable -- but that's
    not the real problem. It's set in 11pt Perpetua. Now, the 11pt size of most faces
    is easy to read. Perpetua, however, is so tiny within its em-square that at 11
    pts it's comparable to 9pt Times New Roman. Even at 11 pts, Perpetua is positively
    anemic. All in all, extremely difficult to read for any length of time.

    they dwell on the fluff and never get to the meat and potatoes. They all focus

  body: "Steve, the trend toward sans serif types in design books may be a reaction
    to the many badly-rendered digital serif types available. I know that when letterpress
    types were adapted for phototype, no consideration was given to the natural ink
    spread that occurred when the metal pressed the ink onto the paper. Also, the
    largest available sizes were used to create the negatives, and as we know these
    sizes of metal type are considerably different than the smaller text sizes. The
    result was type with rather pronounced contrast, anemic and not at all pleasant
    to read.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the early days of Postscript, most digital foundries
    used the same misguided tactic. Many of these fonts were actually digitized from
    the phototype negatives. Of course, designers (as opposed to technicians) know
    that digital Centaur looks nothing like the original metal version. The readability
    problem is compounded when white, coated, glossy paper is used \u2014 the stock
    of choice for photography-heavy art books. In such a situation, relatively mono-weight
    sans serif types that come in a variety of weights (to compensate for the smaller
    sizes looking too thin) are a much better choice than many popular serif types.\r\n\r\nThankfully
    most type designers now understand this issue, and are producing text-sized serif
    type with reduced contrast and more weight. And thankfully, also, book designers
    have ceased to set their work in Linotype Didot and Bauer Bodoni.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    for continuous reading \u2014 novels, long articles \u2014 nothing beats a well-judged
    serif printed on off-white or ivory-colored paper. This is why you will rarely
    see a novel set in a sans serif type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Skipping over the design of these books, what bothers me are the ones I think
    of as prescriptive -- \"you gotta do it this way to get a good book.\" Dowding
    comes to mind, as well as some still living (& hence unnamed).\r\n\r\nThe kind
    I like are descriptive. Rich Hendel's book is this kind. But my personal favorite
    is <cite>Art of the Printed Book 1455-1055</cite> by Blumenthal, Morgan & Godine.
    Once you learn to look through the peculiarities of time, place & technology,
    it is wonderfully instructive."

  body: "As a book designer, I wonder whether it\u2019s only those of us <em>in the
    know</em> who even notice badly designed books. That said, however, I think it's
    the trend to sans serif types for body text in design books.\r\n\r\nJust pulling
    a handful of such books from one of the shelves in my studio ...\r\n\r\nLook no
    further than Karen Cheng\u2019s <em>Designing Type</em> or Jan V. White\u2019s
    <em>Designing for magazines,</em> 2nd ed. Timothy Samara\u2019s <em>Publication
    Design Workbook</em> is another offender. That much the sadder because they\u2019re
    good books as far as their subject matter goes. On the other hand, Rich Hendel\u2019s
    <em>On Book Design</em> and Jost Hochuli and Robin Kinross's <em>Designing books:
    practice and theory</em> practice what they preach.\r\n\r\nAs cool as sans serifs
    look\u2014I\u2019d still like to find a project on which I\u2019d be willing to
    use Optima as my body face\u2014my eyes get tired more quickly than with serif
    type. I\u2019ve read as much. Interestingly, there\u2019s someone on the Freelance
    Publishing maillist (of the Yahoo Group of the same name) who, if I understand
    correctly, is making the case that all this about sans serif being tougher on
    the eyes is a fallacy.\r\n\r\nPity the designer who would sacrifice readability
    for cool."

  body: "The meat and potatoes CAN be put into a book. For instance, there are several
    books about oil painting that I've read that were awesome at describing both the
    theory, technique and application of the craft in a way that made it seem as if
    Mr. Rembrandt were right there in the room instructing me.\r\n\r\nI have a hard
    time believing that the same couldn't be made of a design book that makes it feel
    like Paul Rand or Saul Bass were there teaching me.\r\n\r\nI feel that a serious
    and technical critique of a work from start to finish really helps create a discerning
    eye. The majority of design books just throw out a bunch of designs with a generic
    caption, and never bother telling us just what it is about a particular design
    that is so dang noteworthy to be put in a book that I'm shelling out my hard earned
    clams on."
