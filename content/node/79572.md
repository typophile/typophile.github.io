  There are obviously several styles in this image and since it was silkscreened back
  in 1960, there are probably no exact font matches available but I was just hoping
  to get close. My intention is to recreate the image in Illustrator and have a vinyl
  graphics printer reproduce it. If I need to make a separate post for each font,
  then I will do so at your request. The following is a list of texts from the image,
  each is a different type. Any recommendations as to the closest available computer
  font is appreciated. This is a one-time project for me so I don't want to pay a
  lot for the fonts (close and free is better than an exact match for $20). \r\n\r\n[[http://www.pinrepair.com/bowl/ccmsix1.jpg|Image]]\r\n\r\nStarting
