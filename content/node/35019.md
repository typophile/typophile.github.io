  body: Or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/helvetica_condensed_black/&sample_text=METRO&sample_size=96">Helvetica
    Condensed Black</a> but I could find nothing that matches the R. A solution with
    a straight R might be <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/griffith_gothic_condensed_ultra/&sample_text=METRO&sample_size=144">Griffith
    Gothic Condensed Ultra</a>, though it may be too black.
