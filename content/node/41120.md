  body: "Hi Christopher,\r\n\r\nit depends:\r\npsi is a Greek character (<a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+03A8\">U03A8</a>
    for uppercase), so it is included in <em>every </em> font with Greek language
    support.\r\n\r\nThen, it could be used as a symbol in mathematical typesetting.
    There are a couple of codepoints, depending on its application: <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d7a7\">U1D7A7</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d6bf\">U1D6BF</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d7a7\">U167A7</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d76d\">U1D76D</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d733\">U1D733</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d6f9\">U1D6F9</a>.\r\n\r\nSpecial
    fonts like Cambria Math will likely contain these glyphs.\r\nF"

  body: "Oh, I\u2019m sorry I confused you with numbers.\r\nBasically, I wanted to
    ask you whether you\u2019re typesetting Greek text, or if you just need the \u2018\u03A8\u2019,
    e.g. for a mathematical application.\r\nIf the latter is true, then what is your
    basic typeface? Regarding style/weight, it better should be a close match, no? "
