  manifestos. \r\n\r\nEllen Lupton and her free font manifesto here\r\nhttp://www.designwritingresearch.org/free_fonts.html\r\n\r\nand
  Bruce Mau with his Incomplete Manifesto here\r\nhttp://www1.umn.edu/umcf/event/past/04nov-manifesto.pdf\r\n\r\nI
  was personally inspired by them and was wondering if anyone else out there has one
  that inspires him/her?"

    give one font to the community for the sake of mankind? \r\n\r\nManifesto is...
    \ a good name for a font. But it's already taken... http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typebox/tx-manifesto/ "

    hard to come by... most good designs are hidden away in patents that are either
    never released or approved... i really think that something like the free font
    manifesto is a really read for someone like me who is graduating from a design
    school.\r\n\r\nRomantic but a good read nonetheless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"
