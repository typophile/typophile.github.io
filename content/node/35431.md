body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI have a rather common font for a logo - helvetica, it has
  quite a simple, understated swiss feel to it, what I am looking to do is have a
  nice subtle serif font to compliment it, on the web Georgia works quite well, however,
  I have been told that Georgia is more of a web font. Can anyone recommend any good
  combos.\r\n\r\nThe message I am trying to get across with the logo is that we are
  a company who mix traditional with contemporary... or something like that.\r\n\r\nI
  will try and get round to uploaded an image of the logo so far, later this evening.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLee "
