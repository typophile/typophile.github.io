    of its time. I think it may be worth developing but it would need to change a
    bit.  <BR>I would suggest all horizontal lines be 90% thickness of the verticals.
    <BR>See Alias&#39;s &#40;Gareth Hague&#41; Metsys. I think you may notice a few

  body: In any construced &#40;or I guess more broadly, Modernist&#41; font there&#39;s
    a very strong urge for modularity, for applying &#34;rules&#34;. The problem is
    that a font needs to be more organic than that &#40;at least strucurally, if not
    necessarily in finish&#41; in order to be harmonious for text, as opposed to just
    a bunch of discrete shapes. So basically the &#34;rules&#34; have to be a means,
    not a master - you have to know when to bend them, or even break them outright.

  body: 'Andre, I have been studying the original drawings from your 5 and 8 December
    posts. First allow me to echo what the others have: 1986? Wow. I was learning
    pen technique in an architectural studio then... <BR> <BR>Hrant&#39;s point about
    rules being the means not the master is probably critical in developing Graphice.
    To begin though, I would lean very heavily on these rules to outline all the glyphs.
    <BR> <BR>To my eye the essential character is the bowls and arms of these glyphs
    describe the sides of an uneven polygon or hexagon. It can look really nice in
    letter combinations like the g-r-a-p-h in number four on 5 Dec. It feels dynamic
    in a way many formal unmodulated faces don&#39;t. &#40;I would start building
    the glyphs around this weight&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think there will be a real challenge
    for you in obtaining a consistent form that doesn&#39;t appear to wobble or zig-zag
    up and down across the top of the letters. I also suspect that you might not want
    to make your glyphs too wide &#40;like the &#39;c&#39;&#41;. When that happens
    the top arms or top of the bowls  really looks like its crumbling to the baseline.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also not pursue the directions indicated in you &#39;freitchbalgor&#39;
    drawings as part of Graphice but keep them around for future development because
    the double storey g of 17 Dec is really nice. <BR> <BR>A small departure on technique:
    For what it&#39;s worth , you may find that relying heavily on the rules &#40;of
    which Hrant spoke : the form of your module and the width of characters say&#41;
    is critical in  creating a first draft of all the major glyphs. Then set the rules
    aside and think only about why you made the rules in the first place and set about
    adjusting modifying and unifying the letters to suit that objective only. <BR>
    <BR>I hope you have a really nice Christmas/Whatever, I&#39;ll check in soon.

    Your most recent attempt is good too &#40;for text&#41;, although it looks quite
    &#39;generic&#39;. <BR> <BR>In your first sketch, the shapes are too rigid and
    geometric; follow Hrant&#39;s advice and make them more organic, but do it subtly.

    oblique version than in the roman.

  body: Andre, <BR>I think you are now getting somewhere in your most recent post
    that can be used as text.  Your earliest drawings seem more aimed at display.  The
    ones in the middle &#40;Dec. 16&#41; were more textlike but less dynamic and totally
    different than your first concept.  I think you now have to make some small text
    sized printouts to see if &#40;as I think&#41; there will be dark spots at some
    of the joins.  You can try thinning the horizontals a bit or tapering to the joins
    more.  Another way is to cut a notch at the joins.  This will keep the geometric
    qualty more than tapering.  It won&#39;t be so visible at text sizes but it will
    help even the color.  I am uploading a crude sample of what I mean by notching.  It
    is not well drawn so don&#39;t take it too literally.  It may look silly when
    reduced so don&#39;t feel bad about abandoning it. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/62806.gif"
    alt="notch example"> <BR>I like the inslant of the &#34;h&#34; working with the
    &#34;c&#34;.  I think you need to now work a bit on spacing and sidebearings.  This
    will help you see if your proportions and relative glyph widths are working.  You
    may then see that the &#34;c&#34; may need to be narroed to appear like the optical
    width of the &#34;e&#34;.  Personally, I am a strong believer in doing things
    by eye instead of by ruler.  If it looks right, it is right no matter what the
    ruler says. <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work. <BR> <BR>ChrisL
