  body: 'Looks like a heavied up <a href="http://www.dafont.com/asenine.font?fpp=50&af=on&text=seriouslysexy">Asenine</a>
    by Apostrophic Labs. Doesn''t look so nice to me, if I am allowed to say that. '

  body: It doesn't seem to match Asenine, though, in width. But it almost has to be
    related to it; results I get on MyFonts, like Diode or Linear EF, clearly are
    much further away than Asenine.

  body: Just gotta widen it a wee bit. I think most font or graphics editors can do
    that (virtual) hands down.
