  rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a></b>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophilestoresmall_4661.jpg]\r\n\r\n<b><a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/storefront-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a></b>
  is what the prolific and talented American sign painters of the 1920s and 1930s
  would have created if they had access to the advanced lettering and type technologies
  we have today. Rooted in an incomplete Alf Becker alphabet sample, <b><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/storefront-pro/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a></b> is my usual overdose on alternates and swashes,
  my eternal attempt at giving typesetting that ever-elusive handmade impression.\r\n\r\nThough
  the main shapes, especially the majuscules, are almost a standard recitation of
  the natural evolution of nineteenth century scripts, the additional variants available
  within the font provide a leap in time to what sign makers and packagers are doing
  today. I can honestly say that <b><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/storefront-pro/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront's</a></b> influences are probably less historic and
  more in line with my recent travels and frequent supermarket visits. It\u2019s difficult
  to avoid current visual culture when you're constantly bombarded with it. Not that
  I try. I certainly welcome the overflow. I'm probably addicted to it by now.\r\n\r\nWith
  a very cool aesthetic, plenty of alternates and swashes, extended Latin language
  support, <b><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/storefront-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a></b>
  is over a thousand glyphs for your branding, packaging, and sign making pleasure.\r\n\r\nPlease
  check the PDF we designed with the collaboration of the brazilian genious Dado Queiroz!\r\n<a
