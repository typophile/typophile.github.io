  body: Lots of Benguiat/Lubalin there. Not with that s-t ligature though.

  body: "yeah it looks as though the letter forms had been slightly altered, by whoever
    designed that logo, to make the s + t join. i get the feeling that it was Frankenstein'd
    from 2 (maybe even 3) different typefaces fused together.\r\n\r\nmy guess is that
    it's a child of the Benguiat/Caslon persuasion. and possibly a third...?\r\ni'm
    not familiar w/ Lubalin so i can't say... \r\n\r\n "

  body: "\"Frankensteined\" is about right. The F serif says Caslon to me too. That
    C serif looks grotesquely squared off. I'm not impressed with this work, and I
    think someone with marginal skills mangled a font that was handy to create a fairly
    ugly logo. If it's to be your job to re-do it, I'm sure you can improve it.\r\n\r\n-
