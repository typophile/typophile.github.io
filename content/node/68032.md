  to playing with beziers. I'd like some feedback on my progress. Attached is a little
  process of the modifications.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you think something is too much
  or too little or if you have other suggestions. I want it to feel a little more
  natural, but mostly to just feel \"right\" if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\nevan\r\n\r\nwww.evanmade.com"

  body: I like the second "Jaquilyn", apart from the q, and the third "Shumate". Perhaps
    the tail of y could also be straight to match horizontal strokes on the h and
    t. The q looks like it wants to be slanted and looks uncomfortable amongst all
    the other upright letters. Very nice, but does this retro-look suit her work?
