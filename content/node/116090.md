  it comes to transfer my working habits into InDesign \u2014 you can't specify H&J
  parameters outside of a Paragraph Style Sheet, the keybord shortcut for \"thin space\"
  doesn't involve using the space key at all, etc.\r\nQuark also used to allow tweaking
  the kerning pair table for a specific font, a feature which I've always found very
  handy (to adjust the space before and after the figure 1 in most classic sans serif
  typefaces like Univers or Akzidenz Grotesk, for instance). Does anybody knwo if
  InDesign includes a similar feature and, if so, where can it be found ?"

  body: "Of course you can specify H&Js without using a style sheet. It's in the flyout
    menu on the far right of the paragraph/character toolbar at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also build custom kerning into a paragraph style by using GREP styles. (Yes,
    it's a little roundabout.) You build a character style with the kerning you want
    and use GREP to apply this style to a certain character (with or without the provision,
    only when followed by a certain character)."

  body: "<blockquote>you can't specify H&J parameters outside of a Paragraph Style
    Sheet</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot <em>entirely</em> true - all paragraph attributes
    can be applied \"directly\", i.e., as a local override, on any text. Look in the
    menu of the Paragraph panel. Changing settings through a \"style sheet\" (called
    \"Paragraph Style\" in ID's native lingo) is useful if you want to have the same
    settings throughout your document; but occasionally, you might want to override
    them.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the keybord shortcut for \"thin space\" doesn't involve
    using the space key at all</blockquote>\r\n\r\nInDesign supports more spaces than
    there are hot key combo's. If you find you need one sort on a regular base, create
    a Keyboard Shortcut set of your own and select any combo you find useful.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>
    etc.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nInDesign \u2260 Quark XPress. The sooner you let go of
    the idea that A is DTP software and B is also DTP software, \"therefore\" both
    options and usage (... and keyboard shortcuts!) should be the same, the better.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Quark
    also used to allow tweaking the kerning pair table for a specific font, a feature
    which I've always found very handy</blockquote>\r\n\r\nGranted, this is one thing
    ID (natively) lacks. Note that Quark <em>did not allow</em> this natively either;
    it was an external, commercial Quark Xtension."

    GREP styles, so I'm unable to use Joshua's solution at the moment.\r\nWhat I meant
    about H&J specifications was that QuarkXPress allowed you to build H&J sets and
    save them on their own (i.e. without them being part of a Paragraph Style Sheet),
    in order to use them in other documents."
