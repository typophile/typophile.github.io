  for a dissertation. Those photos came from fake old style newspaper pages.\r\n\r\nI
  choose serif in the classification, but I am also searching for the sans-serif font,
  use to highlight some words.\r\nFor the serif I think this is very close to the
  baskerville font, but some details are different.\r\n\r\nAnd sorry for the photographies
  quality, it's an old digital device... :s\r\nSorry if my english is too bad.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC06305_6185.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC06304_4377.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC06167_5380.JPG]"

  body: You could try [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-sans/bold/|Benton
    Sans Bold]] for the sans-serif, and for the serif, take a look at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-century-schoolbook/|Century
    Schoolbook]]. The Monotype version (linked) is probably the best match from what
    I can tell, though other foundries (Adobe, Bitstream, ITC) have renditions also
    worth checking.
