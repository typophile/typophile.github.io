  Board]] and got a 'similar' hit with Xctasy Sans. The file is a first attempt and
  I'd like some opinions on:\r\n\r\n<ul> <li><strong>Size: </strong>I started in Illustrator
  with the sample as a template but when I brought the characters into FontLab--even
  though I resized them by 600% to be almost 42 pt.--they're still a fraction of the
  default background shapes. What should I shoot for point size-wise?</li> <li><strong>Case/Alternates:
  </strong>Probably more of a personal preference but I'm not sure I'd like to see
  a l/c with this. Instead, I like the idea of alternates but unsure of where to place
  them on the char map in FontLab...?</li> <li><strong>Shape: </strong>\r\n-Unsure
  about the top-heavy B\r\n-Is the top of the Z too short?\r\n-I think the X cross
  either too high or too narrow\r\n-I would prefer 'K' similar to X & Y (a higher
  horizontal center)\r\n-Should V & W follow suit with the rounded N & M?</li> </ul>\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your input!\r\n\r\nWanda.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DecoFace_4533.jpg]"

  body: intermalte, thanks for your views. With the Z in question it leads me to wonder
    if there are any hard and fast rules about this, like, "a horizontal line should
    not be greater than O at it's widest part"? Kind of like general rules for x-height
    and descenders/ascenders.
