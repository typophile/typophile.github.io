  or education except for trial and error.\r\n\r\nI purchased a Handwriting Style
  Font complete with Ligatures and Contextual Alternates, and the product works just
  fine. However I was not happy with some of the Characters of the Font, and also
  the lack of Vowels with Diacritics. So I wanted to modify some Characters and add
  Characters.\r\n\r\nI started out using FontLab Studio and I was seemingly successful
  in Editing everything I wanted but the program wouldn't generate the Font in OTF
  complete with errors, I couldn't find solutions to those issues so I decided to
  start from scratch with Fontographer and I made a few Edits and tested it by attempting
  to generate the Font and it seemed to work, no errors, Font was created, however,
  when I attempt to use the font, the Ligatures and Contextual Alternates don't work.
  I have those settings activated and they work perfectly with the Original Font that
  I purchased.\r\n\r\nI started from scratch again, but before I actually made any
  changes to the Font I again generated the Font through Fontographer as a base line
  and the Font generated by Fontographer still does not work correctly.\r\n\r\nAm
  I missing something? Are there settings or features I need to activate in Fontographer
  for it to make the Font compatible with Ligatures etc.?\r\n\r\nAny ideas or help
  would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\r\n"
