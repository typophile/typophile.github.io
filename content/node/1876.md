  &#40;obviously&#41;.  I would love some input. Keep in mind I don&#39;t have them
  lined up perfectly on a baseline, but be ruthless. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/shananicole/113500.html"

  body: I like it. Don&#39;t let the lack of constructive response on this board get
    you down. <BR> <BR>One suggestion. It looks as if the face&#39;s irregularities
    are one of its most interesting features. Have fun with that and take chances!
    There are a million and one boring serif fonts, and yet people continue to crank
    them out. Take a chance and make yours unique.

  body: Hi Shana, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious to see it, but it just loads some Snapfish
    logo when I view it with Safari or IE on Mac OS X.

    <BR>&#62; <i>when I view it with Safari or IE on Mac OS X.</i> <BR> <BR>Same thing
    happens using IE under Mac OS 9. I don&#39;t even see the Snapfish logo using
    Mozilla or Netscape 7. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any platform specific issues
    indicated in the help section of the <a href="http://www.snapfish.com/helpindex/t_=0">Snapfish</a>
    site. <BR> <BR>The only thing I can find is this note regarding <a href="http://www.snapfish.com/helpviewing#friend">Viewing
    a Friend&#39;s Photos</a> - apparently you may have to be signed up for a Snapfish
    account to be able to view images hosted on the Snapfish site. <BR> <BR>The heck
    if I&#39;m going to do that. <BR> <BR>Shana, could you just post a GIF or JPEG
    please?'
