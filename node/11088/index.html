This included a complete checklist &#40;well, complete as of last year -- it doesn&#39;t include the most recent designs, like the Monticello revival&#41;. The checklist was compiled by Carter himself. <BR> <BR>John Berry wrote an article about the exhibit, which you can read at <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html" target="_blank"> http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html</a> <BR> <BR>The catalog may still be available. You can try contacting Cynthia Wayne, Curator of Exhibitions at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery -- e-mail: <a href="mailto:cwayne@umbc.edu">cwayne@umbc.edu</a> or telephone &#40;410&#41; 455-2270. I think the cost is $20 &#43; $3 S&amp;H. <BR> <BR>The checklist lists 72 designs, including the ITC Greeks.

		<div class="commentbody">Matthew mentions in his introduction that he doesn&#39;t include several faces that have been attributed to him but that he doesn&#39;t consider that he really designed -- including things like Auriol and Cochin and Optima Greek. But they show up in the index that I counted earlier. Go figure. <BR> <BR>He also omitted a couple designs that he did for corporate identities &#40;such as the one I think you are calling Airport in your list&#41; because they were never manufactured as fonts for typesetting, but instead only pasted up from photostats -- so he says. <BR> <BR>I see no mention of Century 725. Elephant was renamed Big Figgins for general release. He says New Baskerville is wrongly attributed to him; John Quaranta directed that one. The <i>Washington Post</i> Bodoni is called Postoni &#40;no &#39;d&#39;&#41;. He doesn&#39;t mention Rocky.  <BR> <BR>He did Ionic Number One in 1999 for Carter &amp; Cone. You&#39;re missing Wrigley for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. He also includes the Manutius Latin supplement to Miller that he did for UCLA. There was Benton Bold Condensed for <i>Time</i>, Foreman Light for <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and Newsbaum for the New York <i>Daily News</i>. <BR> <BR>It is now clear to me that the index I counted earlier is not a definitive list -- it&#39;s just an index; and several entries are faces that he doesn&#39;t claim. So that 72 count I mentioned earlier is incorrect. I don&#39;t have the time to assemble a more definitive list from the 16-page specimen. <BR> <BR>But get the book. It&#39;s well worth it. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj <BR> <BR>I sent a post previously but it hasn&#39;t shown up. Probably hit the wrong button. <BR> <BR>One item you are missing is LeBe, a Hebrew that was used in the Pennyroyal Caxton Bible. Not available otherwise. There are also beta fonts that have been around for a while that have not appeared and probably won&#39;t until there is some commercial interest.  <BR> <BR>I was involved in the Manutius face mentioned by Kent. At the time Miller Text and Wilson Greek were in beta and we needed a roman/Greek face. Matthew configured them for us and also supplied every glyph we could find that existed in the 16th, 17th, and 20th century. It grew to be quite a monster. It is no longer available. I wrote about the project in an issue of Printing History. The beta fonts I mentioned above were also discussed in the article. Not sure how Matthew felt about that so I will only refer you to the article. <BR> <BR>Skia was initially a QuickDraw GX font and had much more extrapolative potential &#40;amazingly so&#41; than what was eventually made available as a TrueType font. Might want to somehow deferentiate this?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, I have Wilson Greek & just converted it to OpenType, with the ligatures applied via a series of stylistic sets. Carter offered some basic help with the project & has seen it, but not commented. At least he didn't suggest I'd done it harm (he's a nice man).

I was unaware Wilson Greek is no longer available; that is a shame. They took out some of the Greek text in the final version, but I used it with Quadraat for <cite>Household and City Organization at Olynthus</cite>.

http://books.google.com/books?id=YenwwRfce9YC&dq=household+and+city+organization+at+olynthus&pg=PP1&ots=8-8ao7y0O2&sig=sYXliPBVBN1Vy3QPb2vpqubY72A&hl=en&prev=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=household+and+city+organization+at+Olynthus&btnG=Google+Search&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPR7,M1

for a sample of Wilson Greek, see the preface (page vii), and chapter 1 (page 1).

BTW I disclaim the title page. Yale took out the subtitle at the last minute & didn't allow a redesign.
