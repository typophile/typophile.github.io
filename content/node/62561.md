  website, but cannot find out what it is! I really want to use it on my wedding stationary,
  can anyone help me find out or at least if theres anything very similar!\r\n\r\nI've
  put the link in as I'm afraid I can't work out how to put the actual section of
  page on here!\r\n\r\nwww.lovelyfavours.co.uk\r\n\r\nIts the script font used in
  the main title that I really like, but would also like to know what the capital
  font is too.\r\n\r\nThank you so much to anyone who can help me!\r\n\r\n"
