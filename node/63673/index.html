  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">right after i got CS3 in 2007 i created a corporate design for an international organisation. i was really positively influenced by the options that came with the <em>hypatia sans</em> font and made it the central font in the design, using it in a mutlitude of variations for titles, headlines, bodytext from logodesign to magazines, letterheads, annual reports etc. - all this believing that the font (including the itallics) would be available within short time. 

The CD was highly acclaimed by the customer and i did quite a lot of follow-up designs since then. by now, though, my client needs to do regionalised layouts and other stuff in departments all over the world - so here i stand not willing (and not allowed) to pass on the font, but not able to supply my client with a satisfying solution. 

here's my question: what would be good fonts do replace <em>hypatia sans</em> or assist it (as i won't change logos and frontcover-designs for the sake of continuity)? 

to make it easier: i only used the stylistic set 1 (i.e. sans serif) and (for headlines etc.) the set 13 (unicase). but i used all 6 weights. i used proportional and tabelar medivial numbers, too.

i wouldn't mind to get suggestions for itallics, too, as they are afaik still not out yet.

i would be really thankful for some suggestions.

What does your client need:
A license to use Hypatia?
Or characters beyond what's included in Hypatia?

If it's the first, we do expect to have Hypatia available for regular licensing soon. There's been a delay while finishing the Italics, but those are now done and the final layout feature work in going on.

If it's the second, please explain in more detail. Hypatia has broader language coverage than most fonts, so I'm curious what else is needed.

- thanks,

thanks for these hints - i learned a lot about Gill Sans and familiar fonts this way.

> <em>david L</em>
actually it is the licensing that troubles me. one of the reasons i picked Hypatia was that it comes with excetional language-support. but there's no use for a broad language-support if the client can't license the font :)
do you have a clue what <cite>"available for regular licensing soon"</cite> means - is this weeks or months? 
i really love that font and it suites my customer perfectly - i'd rather wait some time than switch and change the whole design with all the complications that come along. on the other side i'm a bit nervous as i might be running out of time (and my customer out of patience).
but thanks for your information - at least that is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm afraid I have only a clue what "soon" means in this case. I expect the fonts to be ready to ship by the end of the month - but when they will actually ship is less clear, and not under my control. There's definitely a light at the end of the tunnel, but I'm not sure how long the tunnel is! I wish I had more information for you, but I hope this is some help.

		<div class="commentbody">><em>david L</em>
thanks so much – this really is light at the end of the tunnel and it seems worth waiting for the release. i hope adobe will not delay shipping too long (there are others waiting for the release, too, as various threads tell).

a followup-question appeared to me lately: i know that <em>Hypatia</em> works in office-applications but of course without support for the open type functions. do you know if there are plans to deal with (at least some of) the stylistic sets? e.g. for the specific organisation i mainly used the stylistic set 1 (i.e. sans serif – or dongleless as it appears to be called lately) and it would be handy if the client could license this set as a truetype-font. the same with the stylistic set 13 (i.e. unicase). other sets like the W-variants might not be as important, though i really love the multitude of varieties and use them for other clients, too. 

thanks again,
gerhard

After you license the fonts for your clients you could pay a type designer to modify the font as needed for their office environment. Adobe fonts allow modification in their EULA.</div>
