  body: "Can't find a match but reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica|Helvetica]]
    Rounded Bold (or its Bitstream version [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721-rounded|Swiss
    721 Rounded]]) with main problem for this 2 storeys /g but as I don't know any
    version Helvetica Rounded with such a kind of /g... I know also some rounded grotesk
    for foreign languages (some Japanese like [[http://www.typebank.co.jp/english/fonts/r-gothic|TB
    Maru Gothic]]) have a similar latin counter-part (with a 2 storeys /g) to your
    sample but out of the time-frame, too much \"exotic\" and only similar. \r\nI
    like also [[http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes_pro|Omnes]] as alternative."
