  from Hungary, trying to complete my first font release named IONY:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IONYDISPLAYONLY_4894.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HaiAnhLe--Iony-2011b_4052.png]\r\n\r\nI
  didn't have any education in type design, but my love for letters came early on
  when I was a teenager fascinated by the local graffiti culture. I think this fact
  gave me more free vision about type design, but my technical skills are still very
  poor. I know how to draw the vectors and I managed to get the FL file with the kerning
  nicely but as you can see this particular font needs heavy OpenType coding (i think
  contextual alternates would be the weapon of choice) which skill I still lack. \r\n\r\nFL
  glyphs:\r\n[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19376693/ionyFL.JPG]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IONY-A_6316.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IONY-B_4064.png]\r\n\r\nI
  was reading Leslie Cabarga's 'Learn FontLab Fast' and ransacked google for additional
  help, but I just can't get the code working.\r\nSo now I've registered here for
  a chance of getting useful help/suggestions/recommendations from professionals in
  the topic of coding as well as some criticism about this experimental typeface I
  loved drawing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IONY-Dogma_3452.png]\r\n\r\nIf
  any of you would happen to have the free time and will to give me some hints, then
  I would be grateful!\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nHai Anh\r\n"

  body: "I understand how you feel - I also couldn't find a good source info for the
    calt function.  I might as well try to write one:\r\n\r\n<strong>The Substitude
    Function</strong>\r\nNow, the simplest task you can achieve with the calt feature
    is to change one character to its alternate, but only it is preceded by another
    character.\r\n<code>sub e'b by e.alt2;</code>\r\n<em>Means: If you find an \"e\"
    character, followed by an \"b character,  substitude \"e\" for \"e.alt2\".</em>\r\n(characters
    are referred to by name)\r\nThis is the only  command that you need.\r\nFor where
    and how to write it, see the screenshot at the bottom (but better read on, there
    is some other important stuff).\r\n\r\n<strong>Making Groups AKA Classes</strong>\r\nThe
    second task is to put some characters in a group. Doing this job without groups
    is gonna be a major pain in the ass. Even more than with them.\r\n\r\nGroups are
    defined in the following way (you have to have the @ before the group name):\r\n<code>@highaccender
    = [b k h];</code>\r\n<em>Means: b k and h are now a group, and that group is called
    \"@highaccender\".</em>\r\nFollow this syntax strictly. Dont miss the \";\".\r\n<strong>Using
    Groups as context </strong>\r\nOnce you define the group you can easily use it
    instead of the context glyph (the one that triggers the substitution). Lets revise
    my first example, and use the group that we already created:\r\n\r\nsub e'@highaccender
    by e.alt2;\r\n<em>Means: If you find an \"e\" character, followed by any character
    from the @highaccender  group,  substitude \"e\" for \"e.alt2\".</em>\r\n\r\nYou
    can already see why groups are useful. There are a lot of similar glyps, as b
    k h which should trigger a similar substitution from the glyph that preceedes
    them and instead of writting three lines:\r\n<code>sub e' b by e.alt2;\r\nsub
    e' k by e.alt2;\r\nsub e' h by e.alt2;</code>\r\nYou write one:\r\n<code>sub e'@highaccender
    by e.alt2;</code>\r\n\r\nAnd you can use the group more than one time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Using
    groups for substitution</strong>\r\nSo far we used a group as a context. But the
    alternative glyphs can also be put in a group. \r\nFor example, lets say that
    you have an alternate of \"o\" called \"o.alt\", an alternate of  \"b\" called
    \"b.alt\" and an alternate of \"p\", called \"p.alt\" and you want each of these
    glyphs to change to its alternate when it is followed by, let's say,  the \"h\"
    character.\r\n\r\nFirst you put the alternates in a group:\r\n<code>@roundcharactersalt
    = [o.alt b.alt  p.alt];</code>\r\n\r\nSecond, you make a group that contains the
    original characters\r\n<code>@roundcharacters = [o b p];</code>\r\n It is crucial
    that they are in the same order.\r\n\r\nNow the substitution is done in the following
    way.\r\n<code>sub @roundcharacters' h by @roundcharactersalt;</code>\r\n<em>Means:
    If you find a character from the @roundcharacters  group, followed by the \"h\"
    character, substitude it with its corresponding character from the @roundcharactersalt
    group.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Using groups for both</strong>\r\nSo far groups werent
    of much use. they only saved a couple of additional lines of code. But consider
    this:\r\n\r\n<code>sub @roundcharacters' @highaccender by @roundcharactersalt;</code>\r\n<em>Means:
    If you find a character from the @roundcharacters  group, followed by a character
    from the @highaccender group, substitude it with its corresponding character from
    the @roundcharactersalt group.</em>\r\n\r\nYou can also have several alternative
    groups. For example now we  have \r\n<code>@roundcharactersalt = [o.alt b.alt
    \ p.alt];</code>\r\nbut we can also have: \r\n<code>@roundcharactersalt2 = [o.alt2
    b.alt2  p.alt2];</code>\r\nWhich is a pack of different alternatives to the characters
    from the group @roundcharacters, that can be used in another rule. Try to do that,
    without using groups.\r\n\r\n<strong>A little reminder</strong>\r\nIf you have
    more that one substitution the relatinoship between the different rules can be
    a problem. For example if you have two rules:\r\n\r\n<code>sub e'h by e.alt2;\r\nsub
    b'e by b.alt2;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nand you have a text on which both rules should
    be applied as:\r\n\"beh\"\r\nBut afte you apply the first rule, the text becomes:\r\n\"b
    e.alt2 h\"\r\nso the second one is not to be applied, because the character after
    \"b\" is not \"e\" anymore, but it is \"e.alt2\".\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple.
    Instead of \r\n<code>sub b'e by b.alt2;\r\n</code>\r\nWrite \r\n<code>@ee = [e,
    e.alt2]\r\nsub b'@ee by b.alt2;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<strong>Groups inside groups</strong>\r\nFinally
    you can have group, one of the characters of which is another group. The concept
    is the same. Inserting a group in a group is the equivalent of inserting all of
    its characters. For example:\r\n<code>@mastergroup= [a, b, @roundcharacters];</code>\r\n<em>Means:
    The group @mastergroup consists of  the characters a and b, and of all the characters
    from the @roundcharacters group.</em>\r\nYou can even have a group with alternates
    of @mastergroup:\r\n<code>@mastergroupalt= [a.alt, b.alt, @roundcharactersalt
    ];<code>\r\n\r\nIn this case the rule:\r\n<code>sub @mastergroup' @highaccender
    by @mastergroupalt;</code>\r\n<em>Means: If you find the characters a and b </em>
    or any character from the @roundcharacters  group,<em> followed by a character
    from the @highaccender group, substitude it with a.alt, b.alt, or its corresponding
    character from the @roundcharactersalt group.</em>\r\n\r\nSome advice, before
    you start:\r\nFirst determine exactly what you are trying to achieve.\r\nMove
    from simple to complex.\r\nKeep things as organized as you can with groups and
    subgroups (even if you have only two characters with a similar substitution, it
    is better to put them in a group).\r\nName your glyphs and groups in a way that
    makes sense to you. \r\n\r\nFor illustration of all of the above, see the code
    which makes my typeface \"Alecko\" work:\r\n http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46459223/alecko_code.png\r\nThe
    typeface itself is http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/boris-marinov/alecko/"

    already  know that:\r\n<code>sub e'b by e.alt2;</code>\r\n<em>means: If you find
    an \"e\" character, </em>followed by <em>an \"b character, substitude \"e\" for

    of the apostrophe, the function also changes:\r\n<code>sub g e' by e.alt2;</code>\r\n<em>
    means: If you find an \"e\" character, </em>preceded by <em>a \"g\" character,
    substitude \"e\" for \"e.alt\".</em>\r\n\r\nMy advice is: do not use these two
    functions in the same font. \r\nIf you do, everything becomes a mess. At least
    that what happened with me. \r\n\r\nEven if you defined only these two rules,
    there already is a conflict in your code (Should the \"e\" in  \"geb\" be \"e.alt\"
    or \"e.alt2\"?)  So choose only one of the two (left or right) and stick to it."
