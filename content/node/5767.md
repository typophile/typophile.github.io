  body: Probably, Yves. <BR> <BR>But I think is also probably a reaction to the &#34;see-how-funny-I-am&#34;
    90s type.

  body: 'Really? I mostly associate the 90s with dark, deconstructed,  <BR>twisted
    and worn-out type. Well, whatever, then it&#39;s a reaction  <BR>to that as well:

  body: Yes. Funny is the first word that came to my mind, but, of course, is not
    the only adjetive of the postmodern type. <BR> <BR>I wrote a book about the graphic
    design in the 90s. Do you read Spanish?
