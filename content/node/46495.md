  the fabulous Bitstream interpretation while it\u2019s on sale for only $29.25 a
  style. \r\nIt comes loaded all those goodies we expect in a good text face these
  days too. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro/\r\n\r\nMikey
  :-)\r\n\r\nPS... I can\u2019t think of any time before where Bitstream had put their
  fonts on sale on MyFonts. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see more sales like this from them
  in the future."
