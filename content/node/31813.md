body: "I'm doing the kerning on a OT postscript flavoured font, and I ran into the
  bug in InDesign that causes class based kerning to be ignored. As I could read in
  another thread, there have to exist another feature besides the kern feature for
  Adobe applications to understand the kerning. My question is if creating an empty
  'dummy' liga fature will solve this problem? Would it be the best solution? If so,
  how do I go about it?\r\n\r\n\xA1Muchos gracias!\r\nClaus Eggers S\xF8rensen"

    are available in every font, like this;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n    sub f i by
    fi;\r\n    sub f l by fl;\r\n} liga;"

  body: "It doesn't have to be a ligature feature. Any substitution feature will work
    -- the GPOS table will work if & only if there is a GSUB table. I like to use
    fractions (frac), since as a feature it is usually \"OFF.\" If you don't want
    to have fractions, you can make one for the \"per thousand\" character, where
    \"zero\" \"slash\" \"zero\" \"zero\" is substituted by \"perthousand\" & make
    up a \"perthousand\" glyph. I like this one because it doesn't seem to come up
    often, so the odds of some poor comp (like me) making a mistake & not catching
    it are very low.\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't like the fi ligature as a way to get
    the GPOS table to work is because some fonts shouldn't have them. A lot of sans
    serif fonts have a f_i ligature which is no different in appearance or set from
    the two letters \"f\" and \"i\" If you allow the ligature, some work done in an
    applications program -- letterspacing, tracking, etc. won't work on the space
    between the \"f\" and the \"i\"."
