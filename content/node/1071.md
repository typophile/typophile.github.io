  body: Although your version has a geometric, monoline <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/friz-quadrata/friz-quadrata/character/004F/CP4/"
    target="_blank">&#39;O&#39;</a>. Hmm... <BR>Maybe it just lost some of the stroke
    contrast in the scan. <BR>Where is the sample from, Melanie?

  body: Thank you! It&#39;s from the front of a book cover that I need to reproduce.
    The type I scanned was very close together so some of the letters may have come
    out funny, but Friz Quadrata it is, and I thank you!

  body: It&#39;s possible that the sample was squeezed just enough to make it look
    more monoline than it actually is, though I wouldn&#39;t bet money on that theory.
    <BR> <BR>Nice new icon, Stewf. Man, everyone&#39;s getting cool icons now. I&#39;m
    gonna have to work on mine.

    matchbooks</a>.

  body: Hey, <BR>I have bought a whole collection of those matchbox stickers &#40;&#43;300pcs&#41;
    last summer in Czech republic! A guy on street sold it for almost nothing. I wonder
    if it was his OWN collection...
