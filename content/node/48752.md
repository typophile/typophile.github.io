    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2511839584/in/set-72157605211628155/\">seen
    this one before, in Z\xFCrich</a>.\r\n\r\nBtw, the other script is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/type_o_tones/memimas_bold/?sample_text=famiglia%20di%20pastai&sample_size=48\">MeMimas</a>,
    the Spanish (!) school script. In Italy, the school script looks more like <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/trueblue/pinocchio/\">this</a>; adg etc. are
    not drop-shaped."

  body: "hi Dav, couldn't find your Fluidum (Nebiolo), can you maybe paste a link?\r\n\r\nThanx
    a lot Florian \u2013 this MeMimas Bold is great \u2013 even if I was actualy searching
    for something simular like the \"martelli\" Logo because I've also seen it in
    Zurich as \"baretto\" \u2013 but I guess it's just taken from the other Logo."
