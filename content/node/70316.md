  body: It is definitely not Frutiger, although the proportions are similar, the shapes
    are different. It is not Myriad - check the digits or diacritics.

  body: Thanks, riccard0, but this is the old signage. Barthak is right, the font
    is very close to FF Transit, but the digits are different and several letters
    have softer shapes. Maybe it is a custom typeface.

  body: "It seems the authorities are testing the proposed design in a real environment.
    The Transport Company is silent about it, which is understandable. If the public
    would be allowed to discuss it, the vox populi would say: keep the old signage,
    we like it, it is good. I guess that's why they picked one of the less frequent
    stop in downtown for the experiment.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward for the change
    as the signage today is rather bad and inconsistent. I hope all the bugs will
    be solved and Prague metro won't be a shame compared to other European cities."
