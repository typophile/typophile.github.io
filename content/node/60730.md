    Script Font ID Guide]]. If you can't find it there, your best bet is to pick something
    similar you can find at Dafont, because there are too many of these font styles
    to catalog them all. Many of them do come from a few collections, so that makes
    the exercise worth doing if you really want a specific font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
