    have been a teacher. I am a very patient fellow as we all know. <BR> <BR>Now I
    just love quoting myself. Here she comes. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Posted on Wednesday,
    June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am:   <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant,  <BR> <BR>I see what you see,
    only I read it differently. I see cleaning out the corners. The metal must be
    clean or it will not relieve when cast. It will &#34;hold&#34; when the type is
    removed. What I can see is evidence of gravure slippage, or manipulation error
    on the top crotch of the &#34;h&#34;.  <BR> <BR>On the &#34;b&#34; if your theory
    was correct the punchcutter has lost control. Please draw your eye to the top
    bowel-crotch of the ascending stem. Either the top crotch is an error, or the
    bottom crotch an error? Take your pick. There is no need for one without the other.
    If you take issue to the nature of stems and placement compare the situation on
    the companion areas of the &#34;d&#34;.  <BR> <BR>So no more yeah buts . . . please!  <BR>
    <BR>If &#34;ink trapping&#34; were &#34;the intention&#34; the application &#34;should
    be even&#34;. His work, as you can easily see, is not that fussy.  <BR> <BR>Or,
    lots of theory, little ability to apply.  <BR> <BR>Meaning this artifact lends
    little support to your hypothesis. If he is cutting ink trapping intentionally
    he should have enough skills to apply hisprincipals evenly throughout. I am not
    disparaging the beauty of his letterforms in fact the cut-look-&amp;-feel is integral
    to the very beauty. The crudeness is in effect, much more than secondary to the
    design.  <BR> <BR>But &#34;ink trapping&#34;, come come.  <BR> <BR>These letters
    are much as if they were cut in linoleum or wood. Those are the characteristics
    which come easily when using similar tools such as a gravure. There are large
    and small gravures. Tools, including needles are used in small point sizes or
    tight areas. These cuts are <BR>&#34;humongoumamouth&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Looking at
    these letterforms I see forms worked by mostly a single gravure, large by type
    cutting standards. Certainly it, possibly them, would be used only in the crudest
    of work when cutting an 8 pt. character. Probably, not even then.  <BR> <BR>The
    very nature of these letterforms does not required fine gravures. The large gravure&#40;s&#41;
    have given the design the intended emotions of thedesigner. Cutting emotions.
    I suggest a more finished look would have greatly reduced its appeal.  <BR> <BR>If
    you view the crotch in the Q you will see a place where it would &#34;certainly
    deserve&#34; the &#34;ink trap treatment&#34; you refer to &#34;if the punchcutter
    believed as you&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I see a punchcutter seeking a-cut-look-&amp;-feel
    to his letterforms, and getting it. Forgiving people such as yourselves for mistaking
    them to be either faults, or &#34;in your&#40;s&#41; case&#40;s&#41;&#34; inktraps
    in order to achieve the characteristic nature of the letterforms that have drawn
    our attentions. By the way, which because of the tooling, are acidly beautiful.  <BR>
    <BR>You have to love it for what it is, not for what you want it to be. You should
    remember that boys, and the girls shall be forever thankful.  <BR> <BR>There is
    an acid sharpness throughout, and I suspect lots of &#34;gravure&#34;, little
    &#34;file&#34;.  <BR> <BR>There is a general crudeness throughout and if you notice
    the &#34;h&#34; has another mis-cutting on the top left curve. Also if you view
    the beard of the same character you will see a flatness on the lower portions
    of the gravure straightening into perpendicular at the top of the stroke meeting
    closeto the same error. He is giving a lot of meaning to free handing and that
    I believe issues much of the beauty of this particular typeface.  <BR> <BR>I highly
    recommend that some of you consider cutting types yourselves. The impossibility
    is merely an obstacle in your minds. But remember, <BR>there is few of us left.

    metal type? How few folks still work with it -- couldn&#39;t be much more than
    a few dozen, maybe hundreds, right? I know I only get to work once with it &#40;not
    me personally, but with a printer realising a design with movable type&#41; and
    I loved it, just as I ove steel engraving and all that old-school stuff. But still,
    from the few folks left who in this digital age dig the idea of handlettering
    with lead letters and all that, you still manage NOT to celebrate the joy of your
    common fondness for type, but instead you argue and quarrel. Reminds me a lot
    of the comic-book-forums where in a dying medium fnas and creators alike are rather
    often thannot at each others throats. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with personality
    &#40;e.g. John Byrne and Peter David both are nice guys individually, but get
    them together online and they can&#39;t keep from ... cyber-vomiting on each other&#41;.
    Same story here. Sometimes its fun to watch, mostly it gets depressing after a
    while as it is the internet-age counterpart of pissing in the snow.  <BR> <BR>If
    this is actually keeping people like Joe or Erik or whoever fromposting here,
    we&#39;re all loosing out big time. There&#39;s a lot of folks hanging round here
    whose work I positively admire &#40;and some whose work Ilearned to admire by
    getting to know them here :-&#41;, and I frankly fell off my chair when I saw
    that Erik Spiekermann had written a post or that Yves Porch

    I dislike metal type: it&#39;s highly display-centric and very limited. Letterpress

    <BR> <BR>I should think that those aware enough of type&#39;s nicety and variety
    to be on this list would welcome the opinion and guidance of actual experts working
    commercially in the field, and for decades, as being - well - expert. That it
    doesn&#39;t seem to, evenly, is striking. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s generally been an
    attitude of not allowing the record to be set straight, plus considerable overt
    baiting, that has continued argument in counterproductive fashion. Ending up wasting
    a lot of space. <BR> <BR>I realize that you don&#39;t see that. <BR> <BR> <BR>Looking
    back at some archives here, and on other type related lists, I have come to realize,
    this week, that the agenda of baiting has been going on for many years now.  <BR>
    <BR>That the baiting recently turned personally prejudicial adds to the lopsided
    unfortunateness of it all. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;You don&#39;t want respect

    when I was in Florence and across from the hotel there was a Trattoria with Comic

    young&#39;uns from being led astray by me? Well, conversely, people who have been
    doing something the same way &#40;and in their mind successfully, apparently&#41;
    for three decades are probably beyond hope, at least when it comes to online discussion.
    As I&#39;ve said before, it&#39;s not possible to administer effective psychotherapy
    through ASCII. <BR> <BR>That said, what do you think it means when a text face
    has unconventionally dark color? If you really are curious about any of this,
    you should read Andy Crewdson&#39;s piece about Arnhem on his New-Series.org site.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; how does it &#40;simply as the named example in this case&#41;
    avoid &#39;milking the masses&#39;? <BR> <BR>It &#40;the font&#41; doesn&#39;t
    avoid or pursue anything, of course. But its <i>designer</i> didn&#39;t do it
    mostly because he thought it would be a best-seller, that&#39;s all. As a rule,
    that makes all the difference. <BR> <BR>&#62; Do you really think that my review
    at other designers&#39; types should exactly parallel yours?  <BR> <BR>Well of
    course not. But I do think looking at others people&#39;s fonts helps, certainly
    culturally. So I&#39;m just curious: do you? Bill Troop has claimed that most
    designers don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on among their peers. Although I find
    that hard to believe, it probably applies more to designers more focused on making
    money than those not. Any thoughts on that? <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t worry about
    what other type designers should be looking at <BR> <BR>There you go...  :-/ <BR>I&#39;m
    not meaning to dictate what other people do, I simply think looking at the work
    of your peers is culturally valuable. If you equate culture with materialism,
    I can see why you don&#39;t agree. <BR> <BR>&#62; basically lay right over top
    of letterforms I designed <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s hear some names. I&#39;m not necessarily
    doubting you, I just like to see justice served, and getting things like this
    in the open can only help. <BR> <BR>&#62; And why in the world would you ever
    accuse me or my firm of such a thing? <BR> <BR>Because every other post you point
    out that you&#39;re successful in the field because your fonts sell well! Your
    benchmark &#40;at least the primary one&#41; seems to be money. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    you wadded up the test <BR> <BR>Oh, it was a test... <BR> <BR>Battery: I don&#39;t
    mean to batter. Maybe &#34;wrestling&#34; is a better term. <BR> <BR>Slavery:
    just forget I mentioned it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    I know you have it in you to fly high, and go beyond Mr. Crewdson&#39;s piece.

    influentiable young&#39;uns &#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>Hrant, how old are you? 13?
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;probably beyond hope,  <BR>&#62;at least
    when it comes to online discussion&#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>More pot calling the
    kettle black, I&#39;m afraid. <BR> <BR>Why would working in the field for 10,
    20, 30, 40, 50 years automatically dictate that a designer wouldn&#39;t be able
    to understand current lists and communicate on them? <BR> <BR>Do you really believe
    that all type designers who have worked more than 5 years are feeble? <BR> <BR>Analysis,
    based on empirical evidence:  <BR>This appears to be another core confusion for
    you, I&#39;m afreud.  ;-&#41; <BR>And it&#39;s led you into a lot of unwarranted
    and widely published, very public bigotry. <BR> <BR>Another test, because you&#39;ve
    worked hard to earn it: <BR> <BR>Q. When should knowledgable, working type designers
    post to lists that [Hrant] populates? <BR> <BR>[ ] Only if working in type for
    up to 24 hours. <BR>[ ] Only if working in type between 24 hours and 5 years.
    <BR>[ ] Only if working for 5 - 10 years. <BR>[ ] Only if working for 10 - 20
    years. <BR>[ ] Only if working for _________ years. <BR>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can&#39;t
    tolerate working professionals. <BR>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can&#39;t tolerate working
    professionals because they just don&#39;t understand the real circumstantial,
    consumer culture of type.  <BR>[ ] Never. Working means profiteering, and that&#39;s
    unacceptable since all type should be free as little butterflies. And after all,
    it just doesn&#39;t take into account the real culture of type. <BR>[ ] Never.
    [Hrant] can&#39;t tolerate working professionals because they might actually be
    successful, and success is bad, very bad. <BR>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can&#39;t tolerate
    working professionals because they just aren&#39;t giggly enough, like someone
    who has just swallowed a big bag of cannabis to avoid detection. Just can&#39;t
    tolerate lack of giggiliness or non-gigliosity. Empirically, it&#39;s been shown
    &#40;albeit long before listservs were invented&#41; that non-giglious behavior
    on type lists just doesn&#39;t speak to the real culture of typography. <BR>[
    ] Never. This is my [Hrant] list, so shove off! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;As I&#39;ve
    said before, it&#39;s not possible  <BR>&#62;to administer effective psychotherapy  <BR>&#62;through
    ASCII. <BR> <BR>And yet you waste so much time doing just that. And via offensive,
    unfair, leading, baiting innuendo. Doc. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;from being
    led astray by me&#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>No, not by you in particular. I&#39;m not
    picking on you in particular, nor ever meant to. <BR> <BR>You just happen to be
    one currently dispensing irrelevant, misleading concepts. Then, as if that&#39;s
    not bad enough, it&#39;s laced with vitriol. <BR> <BR>Whether about design, how
    people react to design, the marketability of type, how well certain type did over
    time, why certain individuals or companies chose to do what they did. Whatever.
    <BR> <BR>When someone who actually knows the reasons or the history, says so and
    details that &#40;quoting from empirical evidence, even generally&#41;, it&#39;s
    usually a good idea to accept it and acceed further argument on it.  <BR> <BR>But
    that usually doesn&#39;t happen. Just more contrariety for its own sake. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s about listening and learning. Instead of trying to distract and disrupt
    the class. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;It &#40;the font&#41; doesn&#39;t avoid or pursue
    anything,  <BR>&#62;of course.  <BR> <BR>Explain, please. That makes no sense.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#39;milking the masses&#39; <BR> <BR>&#62;But its designer
    didn&#39;t do it mostly  <BR>&#62;because he thought it would be a best-seller,
    <BR>&#62; that&#39;s all. <BR> <BR> <BR>To all the type designers on this list:
    When you start a new typeface development, do you ever know whether something
    &#42;&#42;is going to be&#42;&#42; a best seller?  <BR> <BR>That it&#39;s a guaranteed
    slam dunk? <BR> <BR>I never do, and nor do I think about it.  <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    I believe you are harboring an idea about that which simply doesn&#39;t exist
    in the real world.  <BR> <BR>It appears to be coloring your thoughts in unproductive
    ways that are confusing you. <BR> <BR>Now, at the end of the production of the
    very lovely work that he did, don&#39;t you think that he hoped &#40;being both
    a human being and obviously a highly skilled commercial artist&#41; that it might
    have the ability to become successful? <BR> <BR>Yes, I should think so. Naturally.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s rational, that&#39;s why. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;As a rule, that
    makes all the difference. <BR> <BR>That has nothing to do with anything. Totally
    irrelevant. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;So I&#39;m just curious: do you? <BR> <BR>Do you
    actually think I work with blinders on; in a bubble? <BR> <BR>Do you really believe
    that type designers of any stripe work that way? <BR> <BR>&#62;Bill Troop has
    claimed that most designers  <BR>&#62;don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on among
    their peers. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re actually going to fall back to quoting Mr. Troop
    on this? <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;If you equate culture with materialism,  <BR>&#62;I
    can see why you don&#39;t agree. <BR> <BR>More irrelevant flotsam. Ear elephant.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Let&#39;s hear some names. <BR> <BR>I only mentioned it as
    an indication that I not only look at other designers&#39; work with a world view,
    but that with such detail that I see where I&#39;m being copied. Or, I suppose
    more precisely, where my development work is used as a 1:1 template by others.
    <BR> <BR>Yet, despite being clear and detailed about that, you still asked, <BR>&#34;But
    I do think looking at others people&#39;s fonts helps, certainly culturally. So
    I&#39;m just curious: do you?&#34; <BR> <BR>And then went on to quote Mr. Troop....
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Because every other post you point out  <BR>&#62;that you&#39;re
    successful in the field because  <BR>&#62;your fonts sell well! Your benchmark
    &#40;at least  <BR>&#62;the primary one&#41; seems to be money. <BR> <BR>Well,
    I realize by now that you still don&#39;t see it. But I only brought salability
    forth as evidence supporting the argument for what constitutes &#39;relevance&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ve already reiterated that. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;&#62;
    you wadded up the test  <BR> <BR>&#62;Oh, it was a test... <BR> <BR> <BR>Of sorts.
    I should think someone as steeped in academia as you would recognize a test. And
    in any event, instead of avoiding taking it, to simply take it and be done with
    it. <BR> <BR>Sure seemed elementary to me. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Slavery: just forget
    I mentioned it. <BR> <BR>Well, I only belabor this because I think you choose
    your very hurtful, unwarranted words very carefully.  <BR> <BR>I think they step
    over the line of verbal sparring; over the line of trading ideas professionally
    about the profession of typography. <BR> <BR>I think it does a very big disservice
    to type and I for one wish you could find some empirical data that you can quantify
    to demonstrate how to stay on point and in a non-offensive, content-filled, constructive
    way. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s supposed to be &#39;wrestling&#39;, go join WWE.  <BR>
    <BR>After all, you&#39;ll get to be on TV. <BR> <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    side-step. Like you keep doing. I&#39;ve answered most of your questions while
    you&#39;ve answered only the convenient ones, and only to go into a long-winded
    diatribe. Well, no more of this bitch-slapping for me. I&#39;ll just choose the
    issues that can help <i>other</i> people. In this case, there&#39;s only one:
    <BR> <BR>&#62; do you ever know whether something &#42;&#42;is going to be&#42;&#42;
    a best seller?  <BR> <BR>Of course not. But each time somebody makes a given font
    he strikes a different balance between materialism and culture. The best example
    I can think of is Carter&#39;s Cadmus: after years of making &#40;or being cornered
    to make&#41; highly inauthentic but profitable Greek fonts through Linotype, he
    decided to make a culturally significant one. It sold like one copy &#40;to Cyprus&#41;,
    and it&#39;s highly probably Carter knew it wouldn&#39;t be as popular as the
    mass-milking stuff. There are other examples too - I know because designers have
    confessed that to me - because I <i>talk to them about stuff like this</i>. <BR>
    <BR>So, specifically who&#39;s work do you observe &#40;admire?&#41;, and why?

    <BR>I guess you mean: like you&#39;ve kept on doing, throughout this rather spirited
    type discussion. <BR> <BR>The pattern loops forever: <BR> <BR>1&#41; I offer a

    question or simply adding a thought to an existing thread, because I think I have
    something true and well considered to contribute, as a working professional. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>a&#41; Insult me further, <BR> <BR>or  <BR> <BR>b&#41; run from the subject
    you started inflammation within, never apologizing for the attack on me or my
    customers, instead moving on to the next wild sensationalism. <BR> <BR>In all
    fairness, there is a surprisingly multifaceted number five: <BR> <BR>5&#41; Sometimes
    you refer me to a standing article that&#39;s not even on point. Or, you try a
    hurried patch job. Or, you admit &#39;no empirical evidence&#39;. Or, you quote
    Bill Troop. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Well, no more of this bitch-slapping for me.
    <BR> <BR>Aw, shucks. &#40;Mommy, they aren&#39;t censoring &#39;shucks&#39; here,
    are they??!&#41; <BR> <BR>Actually, I wasn&#39;t....er...doing what you just said.
    <BR> <BR>All I asked for was a professionally presented critique from you, about
    a subject apparently important enough to you to recommend I find out more about.
    <BR> <BR>To paraphrase you, yourself and You &#40;yes, all three personalities&#41;
    from an August 12 post of yours: <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s a shame [you] couldn&#39;t
    seem to handle to heat.&#34; <BR> <BR>The grease fire on the stove that you chose
    to start. <BR> <BR> <BR>Man, you dodge faster than Ricochet Rabbit: <BR> <BR>&#62;I&#39;ll
    just choose the issues that can  <BR>&#62;help other people. <BR> <BR>Gee, I guess
    that&#39;s other than me, isn&#39;t it? <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;ll never get that
    in-depth, original thought from you about how <i>Renard</i> &#34;mark[s] true
    [typographic or cultural] progress&#34;.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Again, to use your words,
    and again, only using the delightful <i>Renard</i> as the example you foisted,
    foist.&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, whatever will I do for help on the subject now?  <BR>
    <BR>After all, I never look at other designers&#39; work and Hrant won&#39;t even
    share his type viewing guide with me. Wauuuugggghhhhh! <BR> <BR>&#40;Well, that
    was refreshing.&#41;   ;-&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>And as I mentioned on August 15:
    I&#39;m still waiting for a non-simplistic, non-naive explanation of &#39;Circumstantial
    culture&#39;. I thought for sure you would have come back with - at minimum -
    photocopied grade school Venn diagrams out the wazoo about it already. Jeez. <BR>
    <BR>Well, whenever you have time. Between potshots. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;So,
    specifically who&#39;s work do you  <BR>&#62;observe &#40;admire?&#41;, and why?  <BR>&#62;And
    I don&#39;t mean from 30 years ago. <BR> <BR>Just can&#39;t give it up, can you?
    You know, Hrant, really. I&#39;ve had enough insults. <BR> <BR>Look, I started
    discovering type in detail in the 1960s, cross-referencing which designers did
    what. I&#39;ve lived with type studying it fairly continually since, and actually
    participating in the professional side of the industry since 1978. <BR> <BR>I
    spend a minimum of five hours with it daily and sometimes up to sixteen.  <BR>
    <BR>I have my favorites and I have those whose work I care less for, as anyone
    would.  <BR> <BR>There are thousands that are somewhere between those extremes.
    I feel as though I&#39;m always learning, so my heroes are always changing. <BR>
    <BR>I actually enjoy it all, and even with most contemporary, horridly drawn stuff
    masquerading as type, I still try to find its silver lining. <BR> <BR>&#40;I brought
    up Tony Stan earlier because he happens to be one whose work seems to have stood
    the test of time better than many.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>To the list:  <BR> <BR>Beware
    the advice from a quack dispensing medicine with a skull and crossbones on the
    label.  <BR> <BR>A slug from a jug of such glug is not likely to cure what ails
    you.  <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    as TF Alambic or TF Cirgeos&#41; should tell you a lot about me and how I look
    at type. <BR> <BR>Just comparing my TF Forever&#39;s &#39;cultural contributions&#39;
    to the world of the humanist sans ought to keep you occupied for some time.  <BR>
    <BR>Our customers &#40;however much you apparently loathe them&#41; see these
    &#39;cultural contributions&#39; and eat them up. Surely, you will come to recognize
    the differences, too. <BR> <BR>We have an excellent 28-page One-Liner and we have
    an in-depth 424-page catalog, each published this year. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe
    you&#39;re on our mailing list. Have you ever cared about our original contributions
    to typography since 1984 enough to even sign up? <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;
    great display faces&#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>See, I don&#39;t even feel &#39;safe&#39;
    discussing display typography with you, because of your apparently blinding predisposition
    against &#39;obese x-heights&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Naturally, you&#39;re entitled to
    your opinion. But that particular clinginess coupled with an inexplicable disdain
    for anyone who worked &#40;however successfully&#41; over 5 years ago, seems to
    color all else counterintuitively.  <BR> <BR>Leading you to strike out unnecessarily.
    <BR> <BR>Or striking you to lead out unnecessarily. <BR> <BR>One or the other....
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Intellectual integrity requires  <BR>&#62;objective curiosity.
    <BR> <BR>I just cannot believe I never knew that before you just lectured me on
    it. Zowie! <BR> <BR>But hold the press: now you&#39;re &#39;objective&#39;? <BR>
    <BR>And where would you get the idea I don&#39;t like you as a person? I just
    find your public behavior professionally regrettable. <BR> <BR>Lather:   You drive
    your unwitting opponent into a lather. With all the blather. <BR>Rinse:    You
    wash your hands of having caused anything, hoping the list is ADHD plagued. <BR>Repeat:   Get
    it yet? <BR> <BR>When will the pop psychology babble subside? <BR> <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    I really have tried to sincerely and clearly state my position on your unwarranted,
    stupifyingly bigoted publicly published remarks. Including, remarkably, those
    which strike out at <i>customers</i> of our fonts. <BR> <BR>As of now, I fully
    expect you&#39;ll continue with the bombast. I cannot discuss type under those
    terms. <BR> <BR>To the list: If any of the foregoing has seemed self-serving,
    I profusely apologize. It was not meant to be. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>'

    Get a grip, man - I&#39;m not worth it. And just because I&#39;m calm doesn&#39;t
    mean I&#39;m manipulating anybody. I&#39;m not out to harm you in any way. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; I&#39;ll be more than happy to have a civil discussion about type ...
    <BR> <BR>Come on, just name the names of designers you admire! Just follow your
    own guidelines for &#34;civility&#34;, and what do you have to worry about? This
    isn&#39;t some political campaign. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;m too shell-shocked <BR>
    <BR>Then I was right, unfortunately. <BR> <BR>&#62; there are probably fifteen
    years worth of displays and articles out there <BR> <BR>Please do list a subset
    for our benefit. I have to be frank and say that for somebody so financially successful
    &#40;in the context of type&#41; and so experienced, I&#39;ve seen too little
    coverage of you and your work - and I do pay attention. What would you say the
    reason is? <BR> <BR>BTW, I spend as much time collecting references and reading
    up on type as I do posting here &#40;largely thanks to my deep mining of the UCLA
    library&#39;s collection as well as ability to fetch me pretty much anything I
    want&#41;. <BR> <BR>Why do you have so much trouble getting specific? The only
    tangible opinion I remember you saying so far on Typophile is that large x-heights
    are a godsend. <BR> <BR>&#62; Any type specimens you generate from typefaces I&#39;ve
    designed should tell you a lot about me <BR> <BR>Well, duh. <BR>But so can your
    answering some of my questions. <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t believe you&#39;re
    on our mailing list. <BR> <BR>Sure, sign me up. But: <BR>1&#41; I have looked
    at your site. <BR>2&#41; Do you realize how many foundries there are these days?
    <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t even feel &#39;safe&#39; discussing display typography
    with you, because of your apparently blinding predisposition against &#39;obese
    x-heights&#39;.  <BR> <BR>I guess you never got my point. <BR>My objection to
    obese x-heights is: <BR>1&#41; Largely limited to text faces. <BR>2&#41; A functional
    issue, not some prejudice. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, if I&#39;m a charlatan, what
    do you have to fear so much? Let people judge for themselves. <BR> <BR>&#62; an
    inexplicable disdain for anyone who worked &#40;however successfully&#41; over
    5 years ago <BR> <BR>Complete fabrication. I admire many successful people who
    have been designing type for decades, as long they make <i>cultural</i> contributions.
    Names? Carter, Unger, de Groot, too many others. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
