		<div class="commentbody">It occurred to me that Keith asked <i>why</i>. So: <BR> <BR>Gill Sans - the typeface that first make me want to enquire further into typography. To be precise, the uppercase G. People say its overused. Never. Misused, perhaps. ;) <BR> <BR>Perpetua's proportions work so well with Gill Sans, and to my mind is a wonderful marriage. The italics are compact and beautiful.  <BR> <BR>Verdana looks great on screen, both aliased and antialiased, and its all down to its spacing. If you must read on screen, there is no finer read than 11pt verdana on a 72dpi screen. <BR> <BR>Sabon (and Sabon Next) are wonderfully legible and utterly handsome. The ligatures, swashes and alternatives add a depth and richness that many others fail to provide. <BR> <BR>As for Helvetica Neue - everyone needs a workhorse for information graphics ;) <BR> <BR>Sorry for not answering correctly first time round.</div>

Unless you happen to work as an in-house designer for a company that has a style sheet already set in place. (I seem to recall only have a few faces to choose from at MSLO.) However, I'm very old-school and proud of it. I happen to appreciate very much the staunchly pristine work done by Massimo Vignelli (and those from the so-called New York School). But then again, I'm also one of those people that thinks it is necessary to learn the rules so that when you do break them you understand why. I guess I'm boring. <BR> <BR>What about foundries.

		<div class="commentbody">As likely the only person here who has the same birthday as Massimo, I feel entitled to say I think the whole notion of limiting oneself to five typefaces is utter nonsense. I am constantly amazed that more designers don't share my very strong feeling that the content ought to heavily influence the design. Now, it may be that Massimo simply doesn't take projects that don't scream out for one of his fraternal quintuplets, but then, that would be pretty lazy. <BR> <BR>I go through phases wherein I'm more inclined to try a particular couple of faces first (or, like playing too much with a new toy, I overuse cool new fonts I've just bought), but lordy &ndash; to restrict oneself like that just boggles my mind. <BR> <BR>And finally, I will say that I appreciate John Hudson's comment about letterpress publishers. I can understand that a letterpress craftsperson could focus solely on one face, trying for all time to perfect the use of such face. Still, that is a radically different sort of design than what I and Massimo, my fellow birthday-boy, practice. <BR> <BR>Now, a list of top-five <i>foundries</i>, on the other hand&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dave, you nailed it on the head there, and I do share your very strong feeling that the content ought to heavily influence the design <i>(cut and paste makes me type faster ;) )</i>. The work of David Carson amongst others made me realize that the first thing you need to do when starting a design is to analyze the cultural and other demographics of your target audience (whenever possible). The main reason why he got away with those difficult to read lay-outs is because his target audience was motivated. They didn't mind to put in the extra effort to decipher his pages because it just looked so friggin' good and they were interested in the content. I like to see that as &quot;tribal design&quot;, where a certain style with its specific codes, symbols etc. is recognized by its target audience as being &quot;authentic&quot;. <i>(I fear this might not be entirely clear but my English is failing me here).</i> <BR> <BR>As how I try to imply this way of working: for example the design with 7 or 8 typefaces to a page I was talking about in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/5163.html?1044487157"> Matchmaking&hellip;</a> thread was for an informative magazine aimed at parents with teenage kids, but it was implied in the brief that the magazine should be attractive and inviting to the teenagers as well so they would pick it up too. So my reader demographic was split into two definite chunks of teens and thirty-somethings. This made me approach the typography and colour scheme in a totally different way than the magazine for human resources managers that was entirely set in FF Info and FF Meta. <BR> <BR>These are the kind of challenges that make this graphic design thing <i>so</i> interesting. And I must say I can get sooo bored by these highbrow hotshot designers who persist in setting everything in Neue Helvetica 55 9/12. The quote I really like about Schmelvetica is &quot;When in doubt, set in Helvetica. You're never right, but at least you're never wrong.&quot; <BR> <BR>Oh, and before y'all start yelling at me: I <i>do</i> occasionally use Helvetica. All I need is a very, very good reason and a watertight rationale. <BR> <BR>P.S. Isaac I thought I noticed a hint of sarcasm in your first post. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> And frankly, no, I didn't expect that funny bit about Comic Sans. LOL</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I think it was because they didn't read.</i> <BR> <BR>Ouch, Hrant, I'd rather you put a smiley next to that -gratuitous- remark. But then again I'd expect nothing less from our grumpy old uncle. ;p <BR> <BR>I did read. All of it. I have the original run of Ray Gun, and am very interested in <i>all</i> kinds of music, alternative and mainstream (hence my &quot;5 artists&quot; remark earlier on), so I <i>was</i> motivated and interested. Carson's designs were perfectly suited for his target audience of angry alterno kids who were bored with Corporateling Stone Magazine. No-one can argue they didn't deserve their own forum. And some of the things he did were genius on a conceptual level. I mean: &quot;Article continued on cover&quot;? The Brian Ferry interview set in Zapf Dingbats? The doubled Cocteau Twins spread? What an eye openers! This made you <i>think</i>, and best of all it went on and on. And to top it all most of it was simply gorgeous! <BR> <BR>It's maybe because I'm a kid of the Nineties and I'm less aware of notorious predecessors of Brody and Carson, but what the heck. These guys taught me one of the most valuable lessons in graphic design: don't copy, but <b>analyze</b> how one comes to a particular end result and try to integrate the <b>thought process</b> in your work, not the style.</div>
