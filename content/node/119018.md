body: "I'm wondering if anyone can identify the script used on this packaging and
  on the LoW Brew Co. logo. Some similar typefaces such as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-elan/\">Stempel
  Elan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo-pepel/confetti-tp/\">Confetti
  TP</a> came up but they don't quite match. Ideas?\r\n\r\nI can't seem to attach
  at the moment so I'll just link to the image <a href=\"http://lowbrewco.com/wp-content/uploads/growler1.jpg\">lowbrewco.com/wp-content/uploads/growler1.jpg</a>"
