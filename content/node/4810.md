body: Just a quick rant. When was it decided that digital type on a screen would no
  longer use the &#34;slash-o&#34; to represent a zero? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to petition
  typographers in general to bring back the slash-o numeral zero. It would save me
  countless hours trying to decipher passwords and user log-ins. Good typography is
  usually related clarity. Let&#39;s clarify our zeros and ohs! <BR> <BR>:o&#41;

  body: Adobe has been putting in a slashed zero in all its new fonts for the last
    few years. However, it is generally not the default form, but an alternate &#40;only
    accessible to apps that are OpenType savvy&#41;. <BR> <BR>T

  body: That was a guess. My feeling is the move occured during the transition from
    custom, often monospaced bitmap fonts &#40;often but not always drawn by non-typedesigners&#41;
    to outline fonts. Some supporting evidence here -  <a href="http://www.algonet.se/~guld1/index_de.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.algonet.se/~guld1/index_de.htm</a> - many of these
    &#39;ripped&#39; bitmap fonts include the slashed zero.

  body: I agree.  And it is about legibility; oftentimes the only way to distinguish
    between 0 and O is through the context of seeing them in use with other glyphs
    from the same set--this can&#39;t be good practice. <BR> <BR>Maybe you should
    draft a manifesto to the effect that designers &#40;who, ultimately, have the
    power to change or re-adopt such conventions&#41; reclaim the slash-zero.  I&#39;d
    sign it &#40;although, admittedly, a big reason why is because I really dig the
    art of the manifesto; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s done nearly enough nowadays&#41;.

    sucker for explicit divergence for legibility, but the slashed zero seems too...
    brutal. <BR>And yes, potentially confusable with the O-Slash! So maybe a nestled
    dot is better. <BR> <BR>But then there&#39;s something else: this is a &#34;deliberative&#34;
    issue, meaning that when there&#39;s potential confusion the reader has all the
    time he needs to figure out if it&#39;s an Oh or a Zero. So if you diverge the
    glyphs in more subtle ways &#40;like through height, width, or squareness&#41;
    you can really solve the problem 95%, without &#34;brutality&#34;. <BR> <BR>A
    serious problem however is an old-style Zero that&#39;s too much like a lc oh.
    The usual solution -making it a &#34;perfect&#34; circle- is just pukey to me.
    So reversing the stroke contrast &#40;which makes sense in the context of the
    numerals in general&#41;, or giving it weight only on one side, and/or using hybrid
    nums &#40;taller than x-height&#41; is better, I think. <BR> <BR>&#62; Georgia?
    <BR> <BR>But the <i>original</i> Georgia nums &#40;hybrids&#41;, not the later

  body: Good question about the &#34;slash-0&#34;. <BR> <BR>I work at a library and
    trained myself to start slashing zeros for better legibility with call numbers.
    Though the dotted 0 does sound nicer. <BR> <BR>The l/1 is still an issue though.
    And funny  that it was mentioned, as I&#39;ve just gotten back from a trip to
    Paris &#40;Paris!&#41;, where I noticed the numeral 1 is almost always written
    as if it were an UC &#34;A&#34; minus the crossbar &#40;and perhaps with a slightly
    shortened left leg&#41;. It took me a minute to decipher it, but it does seem
    to make a lot of legibility sense. <BR> <BR>Actually, I was considering a post
    about just that. How common is the A-without-a-crossbar numeral one, and are there
    any fonts that use it? <BR> <BR>David Roughs <BR>

  body: im not sure about something - when a reader sees a zero with a slash or a
    dot doesnt he still get it confused with the O? i mean, do people know that the
    slash/dot indicates a 0 and not an O? <BR> <BR>im guessing that the zero &amp;
    slash combination would be clear to most readers, but i dont think the dotted
    zero will be easily recognized. in their handwriting, some people slash their
    zeros. <BR> <BR>anyway, i havnt seen alot of slashed or dotted zeros used around
    me, so maybe that kind of zero will confuse the reader even more.  <BR> <BR>and
    arent there also O&#39;s with dots inside them?
