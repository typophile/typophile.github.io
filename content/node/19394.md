body: "Dear All,\r\n\r\nI am an architect/industrial designer with an interest (maybe
  even a passion) for type design and typography. That makes it particularly difficult
  for me to accept the design and font choice of the logo for a project which I am
  currently working on. The product is a protective item for the active sports market
  and is primarily aimed at a youngish male audience. The general product or brand
  name is POD or PODMX.\r\n\r\nThe logo on the left has been adopted and used in the
  actual product itself; the logo/type on the right is what has been put forward to
  accompanny the main logo in all promotional materials and uses (printed brochure,
  packaging, website, etc...).\r\n\r\nThe main logo is just OK (at best) while the
  choice of font on the right is just plain awful. I am now trying to convince the
  client group that there are better options available in terms of font choice and
  design.\r\n\r\nI am now looking to put forward some alternative font choices which
  have the same feel as the original suggestions (muscular, strong, dynamic for want
  of better words) but which also have a more professional appearance. After a quick
  scan through some foundry samples I thought that perhaps something like Font Bureau's
  'Shimano' family might be a worthy replacement and work well('ish) with the main
  logo.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any suggestions which you might with regards
  to font choices as well as any advice on how to bring the clients around a more
  professional type solution. Please bear in mind that expensive type options will
  probably be even less attractive to the client.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGrant\r\n\r\nPS
  I'm sorry, but call me stupid but for the life of me I cannot get the logo image
  to upload, nor can I find any information on how to correctly attach a file. Please
  help me or point me in the right direction?"

      and they have decided to go with the safe and better option of just using Franklin
