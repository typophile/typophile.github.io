body: "Hi. So I'm trying to change the default Devanagari font in chrome by specifying
  Adobe Devanagari as the default font in chrome. So my CSS code I have is:\r\n\r\n<code>@font-face
  {\r\n  font-family: sans-serif;\r\n  src: local(\"AdobeDevanagari-Regular\");\r\n
  \ unicode-range: U+900-97F;\r\n}</code>\r\n\r\nNow this will work to swap out the
  family, but then the OpenType features do not work. Is there anyway to get Chrome
  to apply the Indic OT features from the font?"

    according to http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/ it states that:\r\n <blockquote>Rendering
    complex scripts that use contextual shaping such as Thai, Arabic and Devanagari
    requires features present only in OpenType or AAT fonts. Currently, complex script
    rendering is supported on Windows and Linux using OpenType font features while
    AAT font features are used under Mac OS X. Apple has indicated it intends to support
    complex script rendering using OpenType font features in the future.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that to get the functionality I want, I might need to actually upgrade to
    Lion or Mountain Lion. :^("

    I expect Thai as well.\r\n\r\nAgreed that Snow Leopard (10.6) may not be recent
    enough for all of this."

    24.0.1312.57 (178923) on OS 10.8.2, and managed to substitute the default Devanagari
    font with Adobe Devanagari. OT features work.\r\nPaul is happy.\r\n"
