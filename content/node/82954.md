body: "I'm looking for a font that similar to Futura, but with a tiny x-height, similar
  to the attached, but obviously without the distortion of the uppercase and the numerals.\r\n\r\nFailing
  that perhaps something lighter, with a more curved w, but still with the tiny x-height
  and the 1920s style. Can anyone recommend anything along those lines?\r\n\r\n<img

  body: Delayed response. Canterbury Sans looks pretty great. Thanks a lot. Might
    just stick with Futura (possibly lighter to match the weights) for the numerals
    though.
