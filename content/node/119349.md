  body: "matkotapko, the sample to which I was referring was a sample of H&Co's Didot
    (their type tester only shows a 36 px sample--not large enough to assess whether
    the slab serifs are thick enough).\r\n\r\nH&Co Didot comes in a number of optical
    weights, and I'm willing to bet if you blow up the 6pt or 11pt optical weight
    versions, you'd see exaggerated slab serifs like the ones in your sample. \r\n\r\nBut
    I have no way of testing my hunch without buying the font."
