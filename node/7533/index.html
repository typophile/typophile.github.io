Bush got over 50% in 1988, but Bill Clinton never even got half of the popular votes cast, because both times he was in a three-way race with Ross Perot and a Republican. Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000, but he didn't get over 50% of the votes cast then either, due to Ralph Nader taking a few percentage points away. <BR> <BR>51% to 48% is a big difference for a presidental US election, and I think that W. has actually received more actual single &quot;votes&quot; cast than any other president ever (because the US has more citizens now that ever before, of course</div>

So most people who voted against Bush will not become angry and forcefully demand change, they will simply say &quot;oh, well, I voted so I did my duty&quot; and leave the acceleration of the downward spiral to the powers that be.

Kind of nice really. <BR>Seeing as all the senior citizens at my polling place were <BR>taking their sweet time, I decided to stand in the booth and <BR>have a good look at my ballot. Not bad.

		<div class="commentbody">Israel is the Jewish state. I will not shy away from being called anti-Semitic by opportunists and ignorants by saying &quot;Israel&quot; when I mean &quot;Jewish&quot;. Yes, nations do exist, but so do peoples, and sometimes a nation is overwhelming the same as a people, overwhelmingly shares the people's attributes (no, we're not all the same - we just all deserve respect), for example the deep Jewish desire to avenge the Holocaust*. Japan for example has virtually no foreign population. So trying to differentiate between &quot;Japan&quot; and &quot;Japanese people&quot; is mostly pointless. But seeing problems in the ideology of a group of people is not the same as dicriminating against its individuals, which I don't do, and nobody should. <BR> <BR>* That's where the hubris is coming from: it's an over-reaction to thinking that everybody wants you dead. But 95% of people in the world simply want to live in comfort and decency. This includes Palestinians. When you take away their most basic rights, you're either hoping to exterminate them, or you have to be ready for them to try to kill you. The sooner Jews realize that eveybody on this planet is a person, that nobody is &quot;chosen&quot;, that nobody really wants to kill for its own sake, then they will come back into the world's fold again. What they're doing now is acting exactly like the people who formed their contemporary, persecution-syndrome view: the Nazis; like father, like son. Advice from one ancient people to another: calm down. <BR> <BR>Individuals are not directly responsible for the actions of other individuals, but they most certainly should feel responsible for the mindset of their society - otherwise you get a bunch of selfish, petty monkeys. Muslim Americans for example are partly responsible for improving the lot of both the US and Muslim nations. I am responible for three nations. <BR> <BR>&gt; were you enslaved and murdered? <BR> <BR>I am Armenian. Our Genocide goes conveniently ignored by the likes of the US and -tellingly- Israel. Also, I grew up in Beirut, during the war. We had about 260 car bombs. My uncle was assasinated. I guarded my school one day a week from 2-4 AM. I was held by the Lebanese Army, after being shot at for being in the wrong place. My brother's car had bullet holes. Two guys tried to carjack my father, and failed when he swerved to make them fall out the doors. And this is all the tip of the iceberg of my youth experience. So I've seen -and felt- much more than you, don't worry. I get my views from the ground, not Fox News, al-Jazeera or the Jerusalem Post. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Firstly, I don''t think that Israel has an attitude of &quot;pay back&quot; because of the Holocaust. Most of the population here come from Arab countries rather than Eastern Europe and don't even know what the Holocaust is so there goes that theory down the drain. <BR> <BR>Regarding the Armenian Genocide, half my staff is Armenian and we live in Israel and we don't ignore anything. <BR> <BR>Regarding the Palestinian people's right to live. Of course they do. And they have the same rights that I do, as a Jew living in Israel and you do living in the US. However, they don't have the right to blow up children at discos, or doctors at cafes, etc. Unfortunatly when Arafat (not sure if he is still alive at time of writing) sends (sent) out children (yes 15-year-olds) to blow up civilians in Jerusalem (which nearly happened today), then the rest of the Palestinian people are going to suffer the consequences. That may mean at shopping malls they will get searched more carefully, and it also may mean the Israeli soldiers may go through their houses in Jenin in order to find the minority of suicide bombers that want to kill us. However, please note that the Israeli army will do everything in it's power not to harm any civilians and invariably succeeds which is more than the American Army does (note recent events in the search for Bin Laden). <BR> <BR>Oh and finally, I worked for 3 years at the Jerusalem Post and although the editing and spelling may leave a lot to be desired, their reporting is damn good!</div>

I disagree that the word 'Israeli' and 'Jew' are interchangeable. It's not generalities that bother me, or racial determinations, it's the discussion. These distinctions drawn about Jews are typically associated with violence done to and by some Israelis (many of whom are Jews), and that (to me) calls for great care, even verbally. <BR> <BR>But perhaps I'm derailing an already difficult discussion.</div>

And monarchies actually have an advantage in this regard, because any change, although violent is: quick (allegiances are promptly declared and played out), and explicit (everbody knows it's happening and that it's unfortunate). In a democracy, real governmental change can only come after decades of spread-out violence, spread out so you get used to it, spead <i>away</i> so your life in unaffected <i>in the short term</i>. I'm talking about the global scale; killing people in other countries to maintain stability in yours is still violence, and it furthermore brings such behavior into normalcy, because you're voting to carry out the crimes.

It contained the most provisions Isreal had ever made toward a Palestinan state, yet he was unwilling to negotiate. It was he and his supporters who started the second intifada in lieu of having peace and independence. Israel is defending themselves, in the same way that any European country would do if it came under similar attack. Western Europe has grown complacent. As the last members of their war generation die out, they seem to forget that they themselves once lived in situations that were less than peacefull or idyllic. The US is often accused as being overly supportive of Israel. But the EU member states are overly supportive of Palestine. Maybe its time for a neutral country (Canada? Japan? Brazil? Anybody?) to step in and lead the negotiations.</div>
