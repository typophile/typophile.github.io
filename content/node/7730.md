  body: The font looks like Saarikari from Test Pilot Collective. I&#39;ll look for
    a link.

  body: Aw shucks, it was mostly luck! It was in the Indie Fonts &#40;#1&#41; Book,
    and I had a sample in the Sans Serif Font ID Guide. &#40;If there were a few more
    letters I would have found it that way.&#41;
