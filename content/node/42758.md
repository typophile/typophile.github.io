  website]] describes a way to use the TrueType bytecode interpreter to attack the
  Java runtime environment and hence any web browser on any platform: \"The bug in
  question allowed an attacker to craft a malicious TrueType font that could execute
  arbitrary native code when processed by a Java applet, thus compromising the browser.\"\r\n\r\nI
  wonder if this also affects TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts, TrueType fonts embedded
  in Word or PDF documents opened in a web browser, or the FreeType bytecode interpreter.
  And web embedding of fonts via CSS @font-face would seem to be dangerous until the
  problem is fixed.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know if Adobe and FreeType are aware of the
  problem and working on fixes for their bytecode interpreters?"

  body: "As the problem (reported by Sun as fixed) was described as cross-platform
    then we can assume the exploit relates to Java's font rasterizer.\r\n\r\nI'm no
    expert but from reading press reports I think Sun's Java  Virtual Machine (JVM)
    currently uses the Freetype rasterizer developed by Google's David Turner - it
    used to use the T2K rasterizer developed by Sampo Kaasila (which is now owned
    by Bitstream) but that was replaced recently in an effort to rid the platform
    of proprietary software. Open Source solutions are so much more secure - except
    when they aren't ;-)\r\n\r\nSo although it's technically possible that Apple,
    Adobe, and Microsoft's TrueType rasterizers (along with iType, FontFusion and
    T2K etc.,) have the same vulnerability, it's unlikely.\r\n\r\nIf it's indeed another
    Freetype vulnerability you may be able to use it to gain control of an iPod ;-)
    All UR iTunes R belong to FreeType!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    make java fire up a local root sploit on a Mac and actually compromise the whole
    system.\r\n\r\nI do sort of wonder why people still keep the JVM around these
    days. Hasn\u2019t AJAX replaced java on the web? I guess people might still use
    it for weird business software, tho."
