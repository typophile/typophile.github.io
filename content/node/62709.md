body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm setting a book of short stories and one story contains two
  slightly awkward initialisms close together:\r\nPhD - which has been discussed elsewhere
  on Typophile and I think is probably best left in mixed case, no small caps.\r\nThen
  two lines below:\r\nB&H - a common UK abbreviation for Benson & Hedges cigarettes
  (nobody says the full name).\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the book I have used small caps
  for things like ATM (on the same page as PhD and B&H), CDs, and  RAF; however, with
  B&H in close proximity to PhD and having an ampersand, I wasn't sure of the best
  option.\r\n\r\n\u2022\_All Caps maybe be 'correct', but I'm worried that it stands
  out a little too much.\r\n\u2022\_Small Caps looks odd, particularly with the mixed
  case PhD two lines above.\r\n\u2022\_Uppercase B and H with a small ampersand (part
  of the glyph set for Garamond Premier Pro) seems to balance the shape of PhD better,
  but I don't know if it is correct use of the small ampersand.\r\n\u2022 Something
  else.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n\u2022\_There are no other
  regular ampersands in the book, only one italic ampersand in a title, and one italic
  ampersand in an italicised film name.\r\n\u2022\_Justified, Garamond Premier Pro
  regular, 10pt/12pt\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/all-caps_3484.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small-caps_5678.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small-ampersand_4560.jpg]"

  body: "I don't see anything wrong with Small Caps B&H. PhD is mixed case but so
    is every first word in a sentence.\r\nI think the consistency between ATM and
    B&H is more important than the visual balance between PhD and B&H (that said I
    think Garamond Premier has very appropriate small caps for this situation)."

  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nYou're right about consistency between ATM and B&H. I guess
    I was wondering if two uppercase initials with an ampersand in the middle counts
    in the same way as three uppercase initials. I think it does visually, but I wondered
    if there were other common practices for situations like this.\r\n\r\nAre you
    suggesting Garamond Premier Pro has a small caps solution for PhD?\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  body: "No I think U&lc PhD is more appropriate in text.\r\nIt's true that Hedges
    and Benson are proper names but because it's a brand name I wouldn't keep the
    initials full caps in body text.\r\nJFK is set in full caps in 'JFK gave a speech
    in July 1959' but in small caps in 'We landed in JFK at dawn'"

  body: "OK, I understand. \r\n\r\nThis way all the acronyms and initialisms are in
    small caps and I get an excuse to use that nice small ampersand. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again. "

  body: I'd agree that the smallcaps B&H with normal PhD is the better solution.
