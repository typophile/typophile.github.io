  body: 'Can''t find a perfect match. I''m not even sure it is a typeface actually.
    It looks more like a custom job made with strokes and circles (no optical corrections,
    perfect circles...). Anyway, if you still need a font that could be enough close,
    here are some suggestions: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thinkdust/ebisu|Ebisu]]
    (little adjusments needed on connections between counters and vertical stems),
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/gestalten/planeta_ot|Planeta]] (very
    close, same tweaking as Ebisu plus adjusting diagonal strokes), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/quicksans-accurate|Quicksans]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/ealing|Ealing]]'
