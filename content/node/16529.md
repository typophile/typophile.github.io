  For a  type class I need to create a typographic expression of a chosen quote. I
  really want to do something both original and complementive to the quote.\r\n \r\n\r\n\xB7WHENCE
  DID THE WONDROUS MYSTIC ART ARISE\xB7\r\nOF PAINTING SPEECH\xB7AND SPEAKING TO THE
  EYES?\r\nTHAT WE BY TRACING MAGIC LINES ARE TAUGHT\xB7\r\nHOW TO EMBODY\xB7 AND
  TO COLOUR THOUGHT?\r\n\r\n\u2014William Massey\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of tying both
  the pentameter(iambic?) and also some sort of mechanical evolution of written word
  to printed type. Is this a good path? anything helps, I feel like Im hitting a clich\xE9d
  wall."

  body: I think your idea of showing the evolution of written word to printed type
    is a great one. But I think, like most ideas, it's only an idea and you may not
    know if it's going to work until you actually try to "execute" the idea. I think
    if you post some visuals you will get a good response from the group here...

    you could set all your quote (but the signature) with the two faces you used in
    the 3rd line (from the top) probably a Garamond and Futura.\r\nWhat`s the format
    ?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

  body: 'I disagree- the colored images are great, but using it as a background distorts
    the legibility of the whole piece. You have an interesting idea, but to me it
    looks more like it''s about printed type than the progression from handwritten
    to print. Keep at it! '

    from handwritten to print, eh eh, sorry. Anyway legibility is not communication,
    especially if you talk about calligraphy. So thanks for disagree, I think you
    pointed out his decision about what element is more relevant for his graphic.
    Maybe the first image on the left should be more related to \"handwriting\" than
    \"architecture\", and so on, to the right part. What do you think ?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

  body: "I do like the use of colour but to be honest I feel your missing what the
    speech, the language is about. I would concentrate on more of what the words and
    tone are trying to say. Strip back the colour and imagery and take it right back
    to the meaning. \r\n\r\nHave you thought about setting the type in a simple understated
    sans serif, something like helvetica and playing with layering by printing on
    to tracing paper or rice paper? Are you trying to get the audience to engage with
    the meaning of the speech or the asthetics of the design? "

  body: 'Hi, thank you all so much for your feedback it has been very helpful. With
    my teachers'' help I have focused more on the visual to thought and speech aspect
    of the quote. I want to focus on the correllation of how we hear sound and see
    color. With sound we are limited to the possibilities that our own organs are
    capable of producing and yet we are able to speak an array of language and understand
    it, through the combination of sound, space and time. With the cmyk printer technology
    we are able to see many colors using only four colors. From the four colors are
    brains will translate the 4 channels into a singular color. So from that I hoping
    it will push me inot a more dynamic design.This is were Im at so far. I have had
    no weekend, I have given it to type. '

  body: "I'm not sure that adding colour and images serves the meaning of the quote.
    \r\n\r\nIt seems to me Massey is saying that the written line manages, in black
    and white simplicity, to provide the richness of ideas and thought. To take \"colourful
    thought\" literally distracts from the more complex way it works in the quote.
    Perhaps I'm off. \r\n\r\nI would suggest an expression which is -- not simple,
    but -- more focused on the lines of the letters and text to make the quote *do*
    what it says. Perhaps use colour in the actual letter shapes, rather than around
    it. Or if you want images, make them lighter, more of a background -- secondary
    to the text.\r\n\r\nKristina"

    things, by adding smaller peices to create a larger whole. I felt as the computer
    was beginning take over, so i decided to print out the letters then cut them up
    and string togther. I\u2019m focusing on the stacking idea of both visual and
    audible learning. I\u2019m might also be using this on my x-mas tree instead of
