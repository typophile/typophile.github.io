    Caslon Italic</a>, with swash caps. If you have the OpenType version (Adobe Caslon
    Pro), you can activate this option via OpenType features (in savvy applications
    like InDesign, for example).\r\nF"

    on album covers maybe first check on <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/index.php?l=22"><em>My
    Type of Music</em></a>, my series of album cover reviews on <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/">Unzipped</a>.
    The type on the Plant/Krauss album cover was identified here.

    Zeppelin done in a slow country blues style, with easy to understand vocals, was
    a kick. \r\n\r\n"
