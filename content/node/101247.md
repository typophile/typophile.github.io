  body: Jan, any idea of the story behind Incised 901 Roman? Looks so much like Antique
    Olive, I stopped to wonder.

    All were drawn from scratch and may differ slightly from \u201Coriginal\u201D
    versions. You\u2019ll find them often when choosing alternate versions at MyFonts."

  body: "Jan is correct. Needless to say this upset a great many designers, and reduced
    Bitstream's moral standing. To their credit however they ended up regretting it
    and during an ATypI conference some years ago publicly apologized and announced
    that they would no longer stoop so low. I fondly remember being one of the first
    audience members to start applauding - I was impressed and proud. May that be
    a positive moral precedent for everyone.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
