<p>I&rsquo;m not being ungrateful. This is a type design forum and Super Duty is a cool font that doesn&rsquo;t work here. At least to me. But I didn&rsquo;t grow to hate Super Duty. I just never liked it in the titles. I think Beorcana is a beautiful font but I didn&rsquo;t like it in the titles either.</p>
<p>I hope Typophile is thick-skinned enough to know she&rsquo;s a great girl that everyone adores. She just looks a bit fat in the Super Duty outfit.</p>

IMO, Georgia is right now the sore thumb on the site.</p>
<p>A sans text face would work better with Super Duty as heads.</p>
<p>So either Typophile should trust users to change the text font, or make the change itself.
Otherwise, it&rsquo;s restricting the kinds of typefaces that will look good as Featured Font.</p>

<p>Nick, email me when you get a chance - let&rsquo;s chat about a sponsorship :)</p>
<p>Of course not everyone is going to be happy win the choice of typeface (whether on typophile or in their local paper) and some folks are turned off by the color red. Super duty won&rsquo;t be there forever, though personally I think it looks HOT. We are thrilled to be able to show off the work of indie designers, and do plan to rotate it with time, as opportunities present themselves.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the perfect solution.
I&rsquo;m just pointing out a discrepancy in the design of this site, now that it uses Featured Fonts.
I&rsquo;ve already suggested two solutions, to repeat:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text type to be user-changeable</li>
<li>A sans serif text face alternate to Georgia, for use with certain Featured Fonts, at the discretion of Punchcut.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the site would have to be redesigned for each Featured Font, but having a sans alternate would make for a more integrated design with faces such as Super Duty.</p>

<p>let&rsquo;s make a bit of democracy and vote. i mean, why not asking the very users of this forum, who are supposed to get these fonts under their eyes on a daily basis, what they wish? a rotation? a static font? a fresh new font? an old one?</p>
<p>or should we simply accept the fact that money is the key, and that the fonts used here will never change as long as nobody gives cash? or will be replaced by more unlegible ones if the foundry gives a bigger check? is reality that harsh?</p>
<p>why not using fonts designed with absolute perfection hundreds of years ago, the kind of ones everyone would actually not discuss about? the ones you are used to read in newspapers and magazines? the ones that are so well designed that you will actually not spend time and energy talking about, allowing to focus on all the other subjects? bodoni, helvetica, baskerville, whatever. the typeface of the month / semester / century can be shown in 50 different ways, money can still get in.</p>

Without the time and devotion that they give—for free, after hours, when they should probably be with their spouses, families, children, friends, etc.—there would not be a Typophile for us to use. They make the code, they pay the bills (rather high bills!), they make the rules. Yes, reality is that harsh.</p>
<em>

<p>Ummn, another Nota Bene… we cannot use fonts designed 100 years ago. Those were metal types. At best (for you), we could only use contemporary digital versions of those fonts. There is a big difference here!</p>
<p>And lastly, I doubt that the Typophile administers and moderators would get so excited about old fonts. Many of us are type designers ourselves, or have worked in the type industry, and what we really care about is making and seeing new designs. Since fonts were made already &ldquo;with absolute perfection hundreds of years ago,&rdquo; according to you we should all pack up our bags and go home, right? Thankfully, as I said at the top of this post, that isn&rsquo;t a possibility, because even those old fonts won&rsquo;t show up on anyone&rsquo;s computer screens automatically! Or at least until someone invents a technology where you can pour old metal type sorts into the top of a computer, and then magically see letters dancing properly on the screen.</p>

The point of the featured font is to show new work. We can see old work anytime we want. What would be the point? Let&rsquo;s let Punchcut do their thing. If you have an idea for a new featured face, design it and let everyone comment on it. Complaining is easy and takes no work.</p>

This is below the belt. 
Can&rsquo;t we leave guilt out of this? Complaining is when you mope and don&rsquo;t do anything. DR is asking questions and giving suggestions about how this can happen. If he could do it, I think he would. It&rsquo;s not clear how this can happen. What we need is not to shut him up as a complainer — we need a clear explanation of how this works, who does it and how much it costs. Punchcut, I&rsquo;m sure, aren&rsquo;t martyrs. We simply need to know if, and what, is possible. Clear and simple, no drama, no guilt trips.</p>

How it works is that Punchcut pays for the web site and the maintenance out of their own pocket. The labor is all done by volunteers with jobs and families and bills to pay like the rest of us. They do it in their spare time and are hardly ever thanked for their efforts. Punchcut tries to support the typography community worldwide buy giving us all this venue to speak and even complain about all things typographic. Sometimes they try to recoup a small bit of the cost to support the site by getting foundries or designers to sponsor a very small ad or use a typeface for headings for a fee. They also sell T-shirts to help with the cost. There is no drama or guilt trip intended by Punchcut or anyone else. Typophile is a community of people with an interest in typography. We don&rsquo;t agree with each other most of the time just like most groups of people. There is no &ldquo;them and us&rdquo;. There is just dialogue. Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don&rsquo;t. No one says you can&rsquo;t voice an opinion but don&rsquo;t expect your opinion to cause someone else to always take action on your behalf.</p>

<p>I see a sans serif, not Georgia. Maybe it&rsquo;s my Safari preferences or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan or Super Duty, nor did I love Beorcana, but what I like isn&rsquo;t really the point. I don&rsquo;t think a font exists that could possibly please everybody here. I do think it would be nice for readers if it changed more often, and also be nice if more indie designers chad the opportunity to sponsor fonts over the course of a year. I hope Typeco got some sales from this, but I bet that most people who would have been inspired to buy Super Duty have already done so by now.</p>
<p>I do hope the grousers are kicking in some money to support Typophile themselves.</p>
