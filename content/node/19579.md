    body: sure, its attached on the first post. our actual font is supposed to be
      completely unique but we could use something such as a serif design from our
      inspiration font to repeat. and our final result doesn't necessarily have to
      be for a gravestone, it can be for anything.

  body: "Welcome Kristin,\r\n\r\nI think there is some really nice stuff going on
    here, and you said it could be for anything, correct? I think with what you have,
    as I was told when I first joined this community, is to find a purpose for it.
    Something I am still trying to grasp as well is how function, form and style cohabitate.
    Finding a function should be your next step. IMHO, it's hard to crit/judge the
    appropriateness of something without context.\r\n\r\np.s. - Where are you in grad
    school?"

    body: I'm at Savannah College of Art and Design. I think my purpose would be more
      decorative..headlines and such, definately not for long pages of text.

  body: "Ok, so it's for display. I just sense that you really need a <em>specific</em>
    purpose. Maybe late in the game. How much longer do you have? You can do it. I
    did my senior project with a window of 10 mo's and restarted at month 7, and it
    was a text face.\r\n\r\nI know it's a tough question when it's all hypothetical.
    I do like some of the things going on,  but a bit of it seems a little too arbitrary.
    But, once again I think if you nail down what it would be used for, some of those
    issues would be evident, and a solution more clear.\r\n \r\nYour M for example.
    The swash coming off the second peak seems, well, is, an unnatural occurence in
    handwriting, specifically scripts, which are the orgins of the swash. From what
    I've learned, a successfull type, text or display, must appear 'natural' in the
    sense that you don't second guess a letter while reading. That doesn't negate
    the creative aspects, but it should take into consideration historical precedents.
    There's not alot of room in good type design for post-modernism."
