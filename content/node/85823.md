body: "On Monday, September 19th, an Israeli court found in favor of the plaintiff
  in a copyright infringement suit against Tzvika and Piki Rosenberg, of Masterfont.
  The plaintiff, Hannah Tal, alleged that the Rosenbergs had purloined the typeface
  Hadassah, the work of her father, Henri Friedlaender. Some of the details were reported
  in Ha'aretz, a major Israeli newspaper:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/court-inventor-s-heirs-own-hadassah-hebrew-typeface-1.385673\r\nand
  another article:\r\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/whose-font-is-it-anyway-the-battle-for-hadassah-1.279708\r\n\r\nWe
  in the United States can only be aghast at such an event, as our law provides virtually
  no protection for the design of letters (or many other sorts of graphic design),
  though it provides much protection for trademarks, the names and symbols under which
  things are sold. Here, the suit could only demand that the Rosenbergs cease selling
  the type under its original name.\r\n\r\nOne should keep in mind that there are
  other versions of Hadassah around, made in Israel and elsewhere, though not all
  traded under that name. And there are original types that were inspired by Friedlaender's
  forms, too. Hadassah, like Ismar David's eponymous type, has become something close
  to common cultural property in Israel and throughout the Jewish world. Both are
  modern masterpieces that have suffered greatly in poorly executed versions (a charge
  one might make against the Rosenbergs in this instance). One might argue, too, that
  the punchcutter and supervisors at the Amsterdam Tetterode Typefoundry had a large
  share of responsibility for Hadassah's success. That leads me to think there's a
  least a drop of wisdom in the U.S. law, though we would do well to have at least
  a drop of protection, too. But woe to those who design a great classic type!"

    What do you think are the better and worse versions of Hadassah?

  body: "Hi Bill! It's good to hear from you. I've been intending to write and tell
    you how much I enjoyed your article on Caslon in the APHA journal. In our mind's
    eye, we each have a Caslon--that is, if you've grown up in the Anglo-American
    tradition.\r\n\r\nI think one would have to read the complaint and a transcript
    of the trial to get any sense of the points of law in this case. I don't know
    if those documents are, or will be, made public. Perhaps, after the appeals are
    over, someone will write something about it. Israeli copyright law looks very
    strange to American sensibilities, or even European ones. Whereas ours is based
    on an 18th-century notion of progress--and, more to the point, the avoidance of
    any impediment of progress--Israel's was born into a helter-skelter world in which
    many who sought refuge there were themselves the victims of the most ruthless
    thievery, not only of intellectual property, but of real property and life itself.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a blog I occasionally look at published by an American-born Israeli IP attorney:
    http://blog.ipfactor.co.il/  Maybe he'll write something about the case. What
    I gather from reading it is that Israel has no specialty court to decide intellectual
    property cases, so the law is made by judges as they go along. What appears to
    be better, though, is that little guys have a chance to fight against corporate
    interests. In the U.S., a little guy can be spent to death in a matter of days
    by corporations who have staff attorneys. Both systems are double-edged swords.
    For American designers, who have largely been closed out of copyright protection,
    we do have the protection of contract law, which is of considerable power.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're as interested in the subject as I am, you might want to check out the blog
    of William Patry, one of foremost copyright attorneys in the land. In an entry
    from some years ago, he talked about book design. http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2006/04/richard-eckersley-and-book-design.html\r\nUnfortunately,
    Patry became senior copyright attorney for Google, which has professionally placed
    him in the position of arguing against design copyrights. If designers had any
    real rights to their work, no matter how minor, the entire system of something
    like Google Books could come crashing down, or, in the least, would be restricted
    to very old material.\r\n\r\nBe this all as it may, I wish you and yours a Shanah
    Tovah! May you be inscribed in all the best books.\r\n\r\nScott"

    fun writing that, because I learned so much from the research that surprised me,
    specifically about the amazing Theodore Low De Vinne, and about Luckiesh, who
    seemed to have vanished from history. \r\n \r\nDavid, thanks, but I not much wiser
    after starting to read this. I suppose I shouldn't have expected to, not being
    a lawyer. Here for example:\r\n\r\n\"Copyright shall not subsist in \"designs\"
    as defined in the Patents and Designs Ordinance unless the design is not used,
    nor intended for use in industrial manufacture.; The Minister may prescribe conditions
    for determining when a design is deemed to be used for industrial manufacture.\"\r\n\r\nHuh?
    Are typefaces \"designs\" in Israeli law? And what does that mean about protection?\r\n\r\nShana

  body: "David, I stand by my previous remarks\u2014all of them. And I agree with
    Bill in his perplexity over the language. Michael Factor's description of Narkiss,
    Rosenberg, Koren Publishers v. Microsoft, in the link you sent, is a perfectly
    good case in point. Also, the Israeli law's extremely vague language about derivative
    works, lumping together adaptations and translations, its deferral of the determination
    of industrial use to a government ministry, and its reference (sec. 46) to \"distortion
    . . . mutilation or other modification,\" have great potential for confusion,
    especially in what may be valuable interpretive works. For the plaintiff in the
    Hadassah case, it was an opportunity to make a sentimental case to a judge, who
    likely understood very little about the fine points on which such evaluations
    are made. The granddaughter's remarks recorded in Ha'aretz seemed to me very simplistic,
    to the point of artlessness. There are honest efforts among type revivals that
    fail to hit their mark, too. In Bill's article about Caslon revivals, he treats
    very fairly the case of Founder's Caslon, which is an attempt at literal-mindedness
    that ends up being little more than an antiquarian curiosity.\r\n\r\nBill, as
    to your earlier question about available versions of Hadassah I like, I'm afraid
    I haven't seen any that capture the forms and movement very well. If Masterfont
    had been truly successful in capturing Hadassah, I would have had to quote the
    old line, \"A handsome thief is always half-forgiven,\" but alas that's not the
    case. It's neither literal nor interpretive. What's interesting to me is how far
    Hadassah had come from its earliest drawings to the final foundry version. (Does
    that fact have bearing on this lawsuit?) It reminds a me quite a bit of comparing
    Hermann Zapf's drawings for Palatino with the Stempel foundry production. The
    feeling is so different that one might attribute the design as much to August
    Rosenberger, the punchcutter, as to Zapf. The drawing has some very Germanic features,
    whereas the final type is classically Italianate."

    strange.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn't Americans - particularly those whose business is
    the design of typefaces - consider that existing U.S. law in these matters (I
    think it has actually changed recently, and the trademark-only limitation is a
    think of the past) is inadequate, and, thus, have no reason to be shocked that
    the more reasonable laws of other jurisdictions are being enforced in practice?\r\n\r\nOf
    course there are ways in which the laws of other countries can differ from our
    own that we would legitimately consider shocking, but this hardly seems like an
