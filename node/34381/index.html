  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Much water has passed under the bridge since last Monday's London 2012 Olympics brand launch. I was quite surprised that no-one (well, only Tom Howe and belleisle made any reference to it) has really given the 2012 font any constructive criticism.

I think only belleisle commented, which probably says a great deal more about the controversial nature of the marque itself than of the choice of supporting typeface which was perhaps a secondary issue in most people's minds:

>>>The corporate typeface they have designed is just as bad, but in my anger I don’t have the will to address that yet.

Have you had a chance to chill yet? If you're anything like me, you're worryingly starting to like the marque, but you're annoyed that you do because, for wahatever reason, you feel like you really shouldn't and have been coaxed and lulled into it against your will because it's not fair that something that breaks so many rules (if rules really exist when it comes to design) can actually force its way into you affections, of which you were sure you were in control. And this is only a week on. And it scares you how much you may come to adore it because your heart tells you that, in an ideal world, love should be at first sight, not at the last. You argue that you only like it because you feel pity for it but then you remember that someone got paid a fortune for doing it and why should you feel sorry for a massive branding agency who have learned to tell people how to think, and always turn out to be right in the long run. And so you're eventually left with only one possibility: You love it because it is rather fine design. And then you will insist that you still hate it (because you think that it would be fickle to admit that you've changed your mind in less than a week). Admit it.

Anyway back to the font, here's a capture from the official website.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2012_6027.png]

Get used to it, you're going to be seeing quite a bit of it in the next few months and years.

Anyone know what it is (Acrobat tells me it's '2012_BoldSIX') and who designed it? I find the circular O's and o's a bit irritating. I think the font (and the logo for that matter) may be patronising in this context. I'm not sure you engage young people by being condescending to give them a look they can 'identify with'. Doesn't wash. It might succeed in making old people feel young again but that's because old people aren't as smart as young people.

Yes that really is an fi ligature lurking in there.

I'm guessing the brief was to get it to complement/echo the marque, jagged and contemporary but having to include/shoehorn in the classical circular rings somehow. Clumsy I'd say, but they got paid for their font which is more than I've ever done.

Anyone know any classic fonts that are patently British with circular O's? Hmmm.</div>

Reminds me this Statler & Waldorf bit:

STATLER: Boo!
WALDORF: Boooo!
S: That was the worst thing I’ve ever heard!
W: It was terrible!
S: Horrendous!
W: Well it wasn’t that bad.
S: Oh, yeah?
W: Well, there were parts of it I liked!
S: Well, I liked alot of it.
W: Yeah, it was GOOD actually.
S: It was great!
W: It was wonderful!
S: Yeah, bravo!
W: More!
S: More!
W: More!
S: More!


As for the typeface, not sure if it was intended or not, but it does have a bit of an 'ancient Greece' vibe to it.</div>

I agree that the "o" is a bit jarring, although not as much as I might have thought before seeing it in a setting. BTW, Gill Sans has a very circular "o", and it's hard to get more British than that!

After nearly 75 years, someone's decided it's past it. Not before Greece used it for 2004 though. Good enough to use twice in a row? I would have thought so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The font, like the mark, is inappropriate. It is trying too hard to get attention, screaming for attention. The whole thing is like an ad for a children's television program, or for candy for children, and that's not the Olympics. 

The Olympics is big fun, but there is also a sense of history and grandeur about it. A great mark and the typography combined will get both joy and grandeur. The multi-colored rings do succeed at that. There is an aura about the Olympics, the 'Olympic Spirit'. Both this mark and its typography totally miss out on it.  

It is as if the designer thought dignity and respect for the hard work of the athletes, and the celebration of multi-national cooperation is 'not cool' and should be avoided. 

I think that is the reason for the anger. If you think the concept of the Olympic spirit is horsesh*t, that is your privilege. But to do a mark that contradicts the positive emotional meaning of the Olympics is bad design, and a huge missed opportunity.     

By comparison, look at the Olympic logo of the upcoming Chinese Olympics:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OlympicLogoChina_4101.gif]
.
It manages to have dynamism and a sense of fun, but gets in both the reference to history, the Chinese location--by using the Chinese 'seal' style logo and brush writing of the words--and a sense of dignity given by the symmetry and the 'foundation' position of the multicolored rings. There may be better Olympic symbols, I don't know, but this is quite well done. </div>

The design as a whole does have some weaknesses. It is a bit staid, and the brush lettering is slightly awkward as Roman. But the running man is brilliant. And now I read that it also reads 'jing,' 'capital' in Chinese, alluding to the location Bei Jing (literally, 'northern capital'), so that is awfully clever as well, making the mark multilingual. The three parts, which work on their own and together, are also very nice. 

Maybe if you read Chinese the running man as character to be read looks forced; I'm afraid I'm blind to that dimension of the design. </div>

"many Chinese gave voice to their disapproval on-line, saying that it was: too much Beijing-centered (!); it was offensive because it resembled a kneeling man with a hat on his head begging; that it looked like a spastic thumbprint, a soggy penis and so forth."

Now there are articles saying the London logo is making most Chinese very happy with their own. That is government-controlled press, though.  </div>

Yes, I know. As I observed recently in another
thread, terminology depends heavily on context.

		<div class="commentbody">Blimey Nick, just what the design forums needed a thread about the Olympic Logo, I was hoping to get some work done this week!

But seriously...

One week on, a couple of interesting points that I have read.
1. Someone, somewhere commented about how, if the logo had been designed by a competition amongest schoolchildren we would all be loving it. Fair point.
2. If the Muinch 72 logo had been proposed would there have been the same outcry.
In my opinion no, Munich72 has all the qualities that make a good logo. Namely a basic sense of balance and proportion etc etc. The general public subconsciously appreciate good asethetics when they see it. (the ipod?)
3. The design was a closed brief at WO that included only 10 people producing he work!
Can't help think they should have asked a few more professionals for an opinion on such a grand project.

As for the typeface.... not for me.

I meant before it was made public, so various people would'nt have have to lose face by changing it. To many egos involved now, we are stuck with it.

"THE WORD 'LONDON' & OLYMPIC RINGS
The designers deliberately avoided using sporting images or pictures of London landmarks. Instead the capital city's name is written in lower case.

The objective in resisting an iconic image was to emphasise that while the Games is hosted in London, it is not just for London, but also for the UK and for the world.

Putting London in lower case and in cartoon writing is a "disgrace" to the city, says Mr Autry, and there's an imbalance in having the word London and the Olympic rings both in the top half of the logo.

"The word London is in an inelegant font, which devalues London as a city," he adds. "It looks like a child's writing."

The font is called 2012bold and has been designed specifically, says corporate graphic designer Simon Murray.

"The style of a handwritten font helps to carry through the contemporary theme. It is quite refreshing that they have used a font that is completely unrelated to the standard Johnston typeface used on tube maps and generally associated with London."</div>

Or maybe this is supposed to be printed on black paper? But even if that's the case, the actual paper color should have been set, which is very easily done in InDesign (the PDF's meta data says "xap:CreatorTool: Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0)").</div>

Paul,
This is not the same casual feel but here is an angular sans italic i did 4 years ago. I only did the lower case. It is one of the many projects I have on the back burner. It is called "Dez Sans Script"

What I find extra interesting about the London 2012 font, Keks and Klute* is that the letterforms are leaning forward due to <em>rotation</em>, not [just] skew. This is a flavor of "movement" almost never seen in type.
