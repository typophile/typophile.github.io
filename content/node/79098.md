  body: "Hey thanks for the response and time put in to finding that for me.  Looks
    great.  At a second glance your completely right about the sans not being Arial.
    \ I had done one of those free script id generators and that is what it told me.
    \ Several of the letters looked right so i thought that is what is was. \r\n\r\nFranklin
    Gothic looks very similar as well.  If that's not it what font do you think it
    is in?  Thanks again!!"
