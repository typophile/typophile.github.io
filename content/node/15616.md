  We now have FontLab. Can anyone tell me a method of importing those kerning combinations
  from Fontographer into FontLab?\r\n\r\nIf this isn't the right forum for this type
  of question, can someone point me to the right place to find this info?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: the easiest thing may be to get <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/FogLamp/">FogLamp</a>,
    which converts Fontographer files to FontLab files.

  body: "You can export the kerning and metrics from Fontographer as an AFM file.
    The AFM file can be imported into FontLab when you are in the Metrics window with
    kerning enabled. FontLab will ask if you want to do with the imported metrics,
    whether they are compatible, etc.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can export the font
    from Fontographer as a Type 1 PostScript font. When you import the suitcase file,
    the kerning and other metrics will come along with everything else.\r\n\r\nYet
    another alternative is FontLab's new FogLamp utility which converts Fontographer
    files directly to FontLab VFB files, as Paul suggests.\r\n\r\nLot's of ways to
    go."
