  body: "Any more letters?\r\nThe _O_ is indeed what the Hobo _O_ would look like
    if it was a crisp monoline.\r\nFor the _O_ also see Dragonfly BF https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/dragonfly-bf/\r\nThe
    _A_ is like a serifless Quaint Gothic https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/\r\nOverall
    the letters feel like a crisp monoline Arts and Crafts/Art Nouveau design similar
    to Dard Hunter lettering. See for example P22 Arts And Crafts https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/arts-and-crafts/\r\nAlso
