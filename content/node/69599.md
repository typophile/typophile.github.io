body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI once saw a french produced movie about the evolution of the roman
  alphabet.\r\nThis short movie described, how the use of uppercase letters developed
  into lowercase through the discovery and use of paper as media, instead of stone.\r\n\r\nIt's
  the evolution also described briefly in Jost Hochuli's 'Detail in typography'\r\n\r\nI
  was actually trying to find a place to buy this movie online, but now I can't find
  anything on the subject.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where to buy this film or know
  any websites with a more thorough description of this evolution of capitals.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nJacob\r\n"
