body: "I'm currently working on a small book of poems and feel that I'm struggling
  a bit getting the right balance with the typography. \r\n\r\nThe client originally
  stipulated the use of Gill Sans for the poems which felt a bit clunky so currently
  I am using Futura + Berling which I think works well and fits close enough to keep
  the client happy.\r\n\r\nI've not set poems before so am a bit unsure of the rules
  etc and the huge variation in line length and poem size has been catching me out
  so I was hoping to get a few pointers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

    If you use Futura, use it also for the titles of the poems. And make the text
    completely black.\r\n\r\nI probably would neither use Gill Sans nor Futura."

  body: "Ideally I'd rather use some alternative fonts but the client really is set
    on Gill Sans, if anyone has any suggestions along these lines that would work
    better I'd be open to suggestion.  \r\n\r\nI've tried with the same font and yeah
    it does look more streamlined thanks. Oh and the text is now black throughout
    though it looks grey here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typical_layout_5764.jpg]"
