body: "I'm currently designing a book with as its primary audience students from universities.
  The attached image will show some example text outlining my issues as described
  below.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to move away from the mathematical perfection with which
  digital documents are now typeset, I'm using ITC F Caslon Pro 12 Roman for my body
  text. For my subsections I'm using Stevens Titling Pro Sabre. \r\n\r\nI haven't,
  however, settled for my section headings. Ideally I want it to stand out of the
  rest without obstructing the reader from reading the first page of the chapter in
  a convenient manner. My current section heading (and number) have two problems:\r\n\r\n1.
  The number is slightly too obtrusive, the first thing that I, as a reader, see,
  is the chapter number, which is (in my opinion) too thick. The incarnation that
  you see is from the ITC Modern Two 16 Light font. Suggestions welcome on how to
  improve this, so that the number has stature, but is not immediately obtrusive.
  I've tried a variety of fonts, including more \"classic\" fonts (Didot? Why not?),
  but none of the font features seem to deliver so far.\r\n\r\n2. The font of my chapter
  heading is currently the same as my subsection heading. Although I really like Stevens
  Titling Sabre, I think the titling should be only marginally more forward than the
  rest. This requirement is considerably hard to achieve, considering I couldn't find
  an adaptation of font with numerical thickness (100-1200) rather than textual representations
  thereof (Heavy, Bold, SemiBold, etc.), which e.g. Lexicon *does* support.\r\n\r\nIdeally
  I'm looking for font suggestions on font size and typeface choice. I'm also open
  to suggestions on other aspects of the design: margin size, usage of quotes, font
  size, line spacing and so on."

  body: 'One thing I object to is the hyphenation, specifically: 1) hyphenation in
    the compound name Meissner-Ochsenfeld-Effekt, and 2) in the cutline beneath the
    photo. Both of these can be overcome by the use of judicious line breaks, keeping
    a watchful eye on the effects of letter and word spacing.'

    you both for your contribution.\r\n\r\n@GeorgeThomas: Alternatively I could adjust
    font size. Unless that would be a deathly sin to the professional typographer?"

  body: "What George Thomas hinted at might well be worth trying:\r\n1. Forcing a
    line break before Ochsenfeld in 'Mei\xDFner-Ochsenfeld-Effekt'.\r\n2. (in the
    photo caption) Forcing line breaks before Kamerlingh and the copyright symbol.
    It ought to look a lot more even after that."
