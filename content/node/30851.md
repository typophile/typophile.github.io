  body: "Nope. That's an old typeface called Tasmin (Bold, I believe). Unfortunately,
    the only digital version I'm aware of is called Tango Regular by WSI - a company
    that made its living selling batches of knockoff fonts to software companies who
    then bundled them with its software.\r\n\r\nEdit: Mike Yanega offers a <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">showing of Tasmin</a> including numerals."

  body: "I had the opportunity to speak with the designer directly. (Contact info
    was on the back of the Calendar.) She told me it was indeed Tango. However, I
    think she may have thought I was the font usage police. I have been unsuccessful
    in trying to find a place to purchase Tango, but really the link displaying Tasmin
    Bold will do very nicely!\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"
