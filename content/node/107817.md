body: I've been using Fontlab Studio 5.2 for compiling OpenType features. But my generated
  fonts only work in Notepad and some Adobe softwares such as Photoshop, InDesign,
  Illustrator,... I can't have it work in Microsoft Office or Manga Studio. For example,
  I can't have the Katakana prolonged sound mark turn vertical in a vertical text
  line. Only original fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, MS Mincho, MS Gothic,...
  and other commercial fonts can work well. Do you have any idea what's the thing
  I have to deal with? Thanks in advance.
