I am trying a little exercice which is harder than I thought, I am not a typographer and I guess that shows.
What should I do to improve this logotype.

<div class=commentbody>At the very least, I would make the flourishes less bold than the strokes that define the characters. How much less is a judgement call--enough that the word stands out sufficiently.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In most calligraphy, if the pen is not changing direction, there will not be a weight difference, because you keep the pen at the same angle throughout. For example, the longest portion of the L changes from very thin to fairly thick, but since you are barely changing direction this wouldn't happen.
Also the thick/thin parts of the strokes are not occuring in the correct part of the loops. Similar loop formations will look the same - the bottom left loop in the L and the lowest loop in the logo should be nearly identical in that regard.
It might help to trace your logo with a calligraphy pen to see where the thickest parts should be and how the inner and outer shapes relate.
The logo as a whole looks very fun. Will this be going on a menu or is it just for practice?

It's just an exercise, my graphic design office is called Lunch Design.
I understand that I don't respect the thin and thick strokes that would naturaly occur with a pen, I am cheating to get more supple result, is that a big NO, NO?

<div class=commentbody>> if the pen is not changing direction
How often is this actually the case? I think this is an
illusion to project an impression of constance. Even in
my beginning calligraphy class we had to change the
angle of the pen sometimes, like to prevent the "N"
from being monkey-butt-ugly.

<div class=commentbody>A broad nib calligraphy pen is not the only way to draw letters, either. There is considerably more flexibility with a brush or quill pen, for example. This style appears most like a brush script to me. Ultimately, it's a question of balance, rhythm and flow.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Pen direction would be "from point a to point b"; pen angle would be what angle you are holding the pen. In general, or I guess in basic calligraphy anyways, you would keep these fairly consistent. From a speedball book on italic:
"The pen...is usually held between 30º and 40º for the miniscules and 25º for the capitals. The letters slant 5º to 7º to the baseline. Steepen the pen angle on the bold diagonal strokes to achieve a more even weight."
The letters are definitely brush-based so perhaps experimenting with a brush is a better suggestion.
Sebsan..just leave it to us to take the fun out of calligraphy. :)

<div class=commentbody>Frankly, I fear this is becoming committee-designed!
Flip back from the latest sample to the first. The first one has a lot of juice, playfulness, and the weight distribution on the swashes really is fine (This coming from an inveterate calligrapher). In the later versions all the fun is being canceled out and logical-ized. For a logo, it can be very lively and messy; see some of Ed Benguiat's early copperplate confections. The only thing I would change about the original is to find a way to balance the density of the decorative strokes around Lunch in the middle. There could be more ornament to the left of L, less density above and more below. Otherwise I think it is very distinctive. Underware does things like this with hand lettering, and it can be very pleasing, without being undecipherable. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey Carl,
You're right, I have maybe followed people's advice a little too close. I guess the first one had something really fresh about it and I lost it in the last one. I will look into it a make sure I go back to that juicy spontanious swashes I had originaly drawn.

<div class=commentbody>I would go for the second one. It has a bit more symmetry; the swashes enclose the whole design, and it is more balanced. Closer to what david shows with "Honor".
You still need to contrast between the swashes and the letters, and Eben's concept may work. It will be something "un-expectable" but ...</div>
