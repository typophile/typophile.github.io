  body: This is absolutely gorgeous, and it is almost certainly custom drawn.

  body: I like it too, except for the word "Pan", which is very oddly spaced. Nice
    period feel.

  body: "I totally couldn\u2019t resist this one, so therefor I did a font inspired
    by this logo. Details are not exactly the same and I had to lower the Caps height
    for it to work and also take some decisions on which way to go, round or more
    squareish shapes, since it was hard to keep the original letterforms.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
    a small preview for those who is interested:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/upcoming_flieger_5405.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
    font will have a large language support and a lot of OpenType-features, ligatures,
    swashes, alternate letters etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the font is an upcoming Fountain
    release, just polishing some final details right now. It will contain three weights,
    light, regular and bold.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.autodidakt.se/index.php?page=news\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/fresh_upcoming.asp\r\n\r\nThanks
    to Helena for showing it :)\r\n"

    got good advices along the way from Peter at Fountain.\r\n\r\nAngel, you don\u2018t
    like the C \u2013 capital I guess? The thing is that it really need to look that
    way in order to follow the overall design I believe, but I promise to take a fiftysecond
    look at it :)\r\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s released by the end of April, but I\u2019m
    not sure yet."
