  body: So what is unique about South Windsor that you could include? Try some typefaces
    to capture the feeling of the town. Start sketching things that remind you of
    the city and of commerce. Brainstorming on paper really helps me. Or maybe ask
    your client what they had in mind, what logos they've seen that are appealing
    to them. Study other chamber of commerce logos so you can decide if you want to
    be the same or different.

  body: does anyone think anything is worth taking from the current logo/seal. The
    town also has a lot of native american heritage, thats the reason for the arrowheads,
    Im not sure about the fish though

  body: "Same here, armpit tobacco.\r\n\r\nAs for retaining parts of the old logo,
    you'd probably better ask them. Or just design a few completely new ones, and
    a few with elements retained from the old logo. I mean, for a project like this,
    you'll most likely present several different concepts anyway?"

  body: "Please don't put abstract circle-headed raised-arm people in this. In fact,
    keep people out of it altogether. I really don't see a need for a complete re-design
    either. To me, the seal just needs updating. I like the background guilloche pattern
    that's currently in the seal, so I'd look for a way to keep that feel to it. \r\n\r\nMy
    starting point would probably be to pull the text down and arrange it on multiple
    lines, horizontally centered under the mark, which I'd keep as a circular medallion
    floating above the text. From there, I'd play around with each of the elements
    to see if other orientations might work."

  body: "- Why put people in? Are people unique to South Windsor, CT? How would putting
    people in the seal say anything about the town? (I'm guessing it's assumed that
    people live there)\r\n\r\n- People are hard to render well in simple forms such
    as in logos and seals. Especially in seals, where the tone is rather serious,
    trying to render people in simple shapes\u2014circles, lines, arcs\u2014comes
    off as silly and childish."

  body: 'In addition and in this case, the history of South Windsor dates back to
    the use of slave for tobacco farming. not exactly something you want to showcase...or
    maybe they do. The reason I know this is because I read their "about us" pdf on
    their site. Plus, they bought land from the native american at a really low price,
    which might indicate they took advantage of natives. So, i would agree people
    in this case might not be the best approach. '

  body: The community plays a huge part in the chamber and its people that keep it
    running whether it be business people or people that work at the chamber. The
    seal also has to be done away with, according to the head of the chamber its dated
    and involves too much history of the town, history that has to deal with slaves
    and farming which is far from what south windsor is like today. The seal looks
    like its from the 1800s (Which it probably is) and even with a revamp the same
    message will still be delivered. plus it get pretty illegible when shrunk down,
    especially with the cross hatching background. They want something clean, sophisticated
    and memorable and obviously something that can be resized, faxed and copied easily
    and still retain clarity. Small detailed drawings might not be the way to go.
    I do however like the seal but after speaking to them about it they don't want
    to revamp it, they want to get rid of it.

    like they want to cover up their history, so it looks like tobacco leaves and
    arrowheads are out. Did you talk with them about what they might want to be part
    of the new mark? (Aside from wanting it to be clean, sophisticated and memorable
    \u2014 the three most overused adjectives to describe logos)"
