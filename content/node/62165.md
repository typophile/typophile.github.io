  typography.\r\n\r\nIt's a sample of an arch yearbook. I wanted to know what is the
  title font (\"unit B\") and the core text.\r\n\r\nI'm writing my diploma thesis
  in arch and try to find some legible elegant font for some 20 pages of text divided
  into some 200-words units. Maybe you could advise anything?\r\n\r\nThank you[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yearbook2008-13_3828.jpg]"

    I'd advise you put that in a separate thread, possibly in the Design forum. And
    more specifics are always better when it comes to recommendations \u2013 there
    are a lot of good fonts out there :)"
