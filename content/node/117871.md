body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brian Voelker_5341.jpg]\r\n\r\nI work for
  a company that specializes in Personalized Brick Fundraisers and recently have acquired
  a new customer who has existing personalized bricks from a vendor that is no longer
  in business. This customer would really like to be able to order more bricks but
  they don't know what font was used and would really like the new bricks to match
  the old bricks.  After many unreturned phone calls and emails to the previous vendor,
  I have taken matters into my own hands.  Which is why I am now typing this...I have
  spent the last two hours attempting to figure it out and I really have no idea what
  I am doing.  I have tried \"whatthefont\" and \"font identifier\". \r\n\r\nThe results
  they have given me are: \r\n\r\nEF TV Nord - the M does not match though\r\n\r\nand
  \r\n\r\nTrade Journal Narrow JNL - the R does not match though\r\n\r\nAny help/direction
  or advise would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE. "

    Bell Gothic]], manually condensed. The <strong>S</strong> looks a little off,
    but it might be close enough.

  body: "Bell Gothic is a good visual match, but it's a font not typically known outside
    of the design world and its modifications (stroke connections are cut/sharpened,
    to prevent ink build-up and to improve printed legibility) wouldn't be helpful
    in a sandblasted application.\r\n\r\nTrade Gothic Condensed is more common, and

  body: 'Thank you all for you input, it is GREATLY APPRECIATED. I know this is difficult
    because the previous vendor did use sandblasting so as you can tell, though the
    same font was used throughout, not all the characters came out consistently. '
