    You could add a simple line shadow to any of these."

    just aren't the same

  body: Yes, contemporary font design is very different. Many metal and wood types
    have been digitized, but there are many more that have not.

  body: "One of my favorites for this kind of type has always been Solotype. Way back
    in the day, before digital type, Dan Solo's company created custom display type
    to customer's specifications. They would also take off time every year to travel
    the world and add to their collection, which is massive. Several years ago Dover
    published a catalog of their specimens. It's worth the 10 or 20 bucks to get one.
    Thankfully they started digitizing their specimens a few years ago. They may have
    the exact font you are looking for. There was a link on their MyFonts page that
    was very close:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/quadrille-2\r\n\r\nTo
    get that distressed/aged look, I tweak the outlines in Illustrator and then grunge
    it in Photoshop, sometimes using filters like Machine Wash."

    is closer than Quadrille. But definately checkout Mr. Retro's Machine Wash filters
    for getting that aged look.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mrretro.com/image_filters.html\r\n\r\nClick
    on test drive to see samples."

  body: The finish of Archive Type's stuff looks great, but you'll acheive a more
    authentic look if you start with a clean typeface and "antique" it yourself after
    setting. This way, no two characters look the same.
