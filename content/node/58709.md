  usage. The typeface is based on designs by Austrian architect Paul Grueber in the
  early 1900s for castle Hoch Osterwitz.\r\n\r\nDalton Maag also releases true Italic
  forms for our popular typeface Effra. The addition of Italics makes Effra a versatile
  choice for any design project.\r\n\r\nwww.daltonmaag.com"

    in Berlin and it's now up on my wall \u2013 quite an exciting design! Love the

  body: "Franz, you refer to Effra, I presume. Do you think this is anything like
    Frutiger? Well, I have no problems to agree that Frutiger is a good typeface,
    but Effra is about as close to it as I am as close to become the next UK prime
    minister.\r\n\r\nNick, no Grueber has no l/c alternates - yet at least. In fact,
    on the original carvings at the castle, what are now alternates were the actual
    letters. Together with Lukas we decided that we need more traditional designs
    in the base keyboard positions to cater for the more conservative tastes. As the
    l/c had no template to work from we decided for the time being not to include
    alternate designs."
