  body: "That is the font known as Athletic Script (a.k.a. Opti Sport Script and Spoleto).
    It comes up a lot, and locating versions of it has been difficult. I have Spoleto
    from the Expresiv Ornate font collection in the mid-90's. You can see [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg14.html|Spoleto]]
    in the Script Guide, Part 7, page 14.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
