  craft a diplomatically informative reply. Any ideas?\r\n \r\n\"I would very much
  like to use the font on a banner for my jewelry booth at a local market, but the
  largest size that My Fonts offers is 72 pt.  Would it be possible to purchase larger
  sizes for my own limited use?  And if not, what would be the best way to enlarge
  what I already have? \""

  body: "\"Dear ______,\r\n\r\nThe maximum 72pt size on the MyFonts website is only
    the maximum preview size. The point of the preview is to give you an idea of what
    the font looks like, not to provide artwork for e.g. the kind of usage you describe.
    If you purchase the font through MyFonts, you will receive (downloadable from
    the site once your payment has been processed) a scaleable outline format font
    that you can install on your computer and then use to create as large a banner
    as you want, limited only by the output device (printer, vinyl cutter, etc.) or
    the software you use to create the banner.\r\n\r\nSincerely...\""

    download and install the font once purchased, and then support queries about how
    to use it. This can be frustrating, but I've come to value very highly my 'na\xEFve
    tester', a man manages to get himself into all sorts of problems trying to install
    and fonts. His troubles help me understand the myriad ways in which someone can
    get confused and break things that I didn't think could be broken. It is also
    salutary to reflect that within his area of expertise -- which clearly isn't fonts
    -- he is an obviously intelligent and respected scholar."

    ago I was designing some business forms for a large corporation. We tried to make
    them as clear and easy as possible. Before printing we  passed them out to a bunch
    of ordinary folks and ask them to fill them out. We were surprised when  stuff
    we thought was perfectly clear was sometimes misunderstood. The test ended up
    being very useful.\r\n"

    some newly written test software and peek over his shoulder, he invariable makes
    me squirm uncomfortably from the word \"go\". Behind his back, I'm always feverishly
    jotting down notes."
