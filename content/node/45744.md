  this <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=7\">small
  but wonderful exhibition</a> at <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/visit/default.asp\">The
  Morgan Library and Museum</a>. Two of the bibles on display are made up of two volumes
  each, so you get to see eight spreads in all. (Read some more about each book <a
  href=\"http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/museums-culture/29702/exhibit-a-three-gutenberg-bibles\">here</a>.)
  <!--break-->The exhibition is rounded out with an <a href=\"http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/gutenberg.htm\">indulgence</a>
  printed by Gutenberg and two Psalters printed by  Gutenberg's successors, <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi753.htm\">Fust
  and Schoeffer</a>. These psalters were the first printed books to carry a colophon.\r\n\r\nAlso
  worth checking out is the exhibition upstairs, <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/collections/swf/exhibOnline.asp?id=800\">Illuminating
  the Medieval Hunt</a>. But that one <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=2\">ends
  August 10</a>."

    that they have taken the book apart for conservation and restoration, and have
    a substantial number of individual pages in separate cabinets for examination.
    The detail in both the hand-lettered characters and the illustrations is mind-boggling....\r\n\r\nJames,
    the Morgan is also free on Fridays from 7-9 p.m.  If you were also going to visit
    the Metropolitan Museum of Art, don't forget your admission also gets you into
    The Cloisters, where there's also some amazing examples of hand-lettering and
    early printing in the Treasures Room.\r\n\r\n(And BTW, Ricardo, I had a blast
    at brunch -- we must do that again....)"

    that is really something. I think, however, that they also took it apart so that
    a german company could make a facsimile of the book -- a copy of said facsimile
    is set up right in front of you when you walk into the room, so that you can thumb
    through it. But of course, after a while you want to go look at the real pages.

    recovering from two crazy days of work -- that was one rough week!)"

    </em>\r\n\r\nhmm.  I missed that. Actually, I don't have a problem with a copy
    being made of it -- presuming, of course, it's going to be to the same standards
    of reproduction as the large wall display copies. Talk about being hi-res scans!
    \ Great way to see all that lovely detail.\r\n\r\n(And since they don't let you
    take pix, I wouldn't mind having a copy of it myself....)"
