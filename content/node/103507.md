  late 1700s style in an English text) out of using the OpenType \u203AContextuals\u2039
  feature as a tool to substitute every (!) non-final <code>s</code> by an <code>\u017F</code>
  -- as \u017F usage is a lot more complex than that.\r\n\r\nNow what this issue reminded
  me of was having seen a <code>longs_s</code> ligature in an English text once --
  an <code>\xDF</code>, effectively. 17th or 18th century, I guess. I just can't find
  it. Un-ligated <code>longs_s</code> + <code>s</code> <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/uSixM.png\">are</a>
  <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Long-s-US-Bill-of-Rights.jpg\">everywhere,</a>
  but that's not what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nBut maybe I'm on the wrong track...
  has anyone else seen something like this and would be willing to post a specimen?\r\nthanks
  in advance!"

    there may be some italic fonts from the late 18th century that follow the contemporary
    writing practice of /\xDF for double-s.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve put a long-s feature
    in several typefaces, but in the \u201Chist\u201D feature (for when and if that
    gets supported by layout apps) and as a Stylistic Set.\r\n\r\nMy present thinking
    is to employ a double long s (with appropriate ligature in the ligature feature)
    in the code, rather than long s followed by short s (except at the end of words,
    of course), as I think if people are going to use this feature, they would like
    to see as many long-s\u2019s as possible!\r\n"

    for a particular language (English) at a particular time (17th and 18th century),
    which is what I\u2019ve done.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would be most appropriate for
    Caslon or Baskerville typefaces, but that kind of precise historical allusion
    is rare\u2014most typographers prefer to use old style types for 19th century

    to Kevin\u2019s insight on typographic licence, I recently posted this image in
    another thread, and noticed that /\u017F is not employed where an /s ligature
    is available (<em>C\u2019est, cascatelle</em>), or to start a word (<em>sa</em>)\u2014presumably
    because by the time the reader gets to the second syllable of <em>bai\u017F\xE9e</em>
    or the third syllable of <em>embra\u017F\xE9e</em> it\u2019s quite clear what
    the word will be, and there is no likelihood of mistaking \u017F for f, which
    might occur with <em>\u017Fa</em>. Light seasoning, as it were.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poem4_4132.png]\r\nVerlaine:
