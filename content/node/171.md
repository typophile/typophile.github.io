body: i&#39;m wondering if anybody knows how to lower underlines in InDesign so they
  don&#39;t cut through the descenders? <BR> <BR>if you do, your help is appreciated.

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure it ain&#39;t possible. <BR> <BR>You can, of course, draw
    one yourself, but it won&#39;t flow. I tried pasting one in and kerning back over
    it, but that wasn&#39;t happening either. <BR> <BR>One solution would be to not
    underline the offending descenders, as in this <u>exam</u>p<u>le</u>. <BR> <BR>Of
    course, I&#39;ll add that probably the reason you can&#39;t adjust underline preferences
    in InDesign &#40;they&#39;re stuck at one-half point as well&#41; is that underlines
    just aren&#39;t that pretty. I&#39;ll just assume that somebody is putting a gun
    to your head and insisting you use them. It has happened to me.

  body: It might be a little more work, but you could use the &#34;rule&#34; feature.
    You would then be able to control distance and weight of the line. Set up a character
    style based on your preferences. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Huh? Do you mean paragraph rules? I can&#39;t find a &#34;rule&#34; property
    or command at a character level.

  body: Yeah, I thought about rules too, but I&#39;m, pretty sure they  <BR>are available
    only at the paragraph level. If you&#39;re  <BR>underlining entire lines it&#39;s
    just the solution you&#39;re looking  <BR>for. But for single words within lines
    rules aren&#39;t going to do it.

  body: BTW, if you&#39;re using underlines for emphasis you might  <BR>consider using
    italics, small caps, or bold instead.

  body: True, rules are paragraph options, but they can be tweaked and offset to function
    as underlines if that was truly desired. See the attached screenshot. <BR> <BR>Please
    note that I am not actually suggesting such an insidious hack. The rule would
    neither flow with text nor linespacing change. I&#39;m merely pointed out that
    it&#39;s possible as a stopgap solution. <BR> <BR>Your specific suggestions above
    were exactly what I was alluding to. You eloquently clarified my apparently flippant
    comments before. I am determined to express myself more gracefully from now on
    in this forum. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: i&#39;m typesetting a peotry journal, so much fun, and the underlines stay.
    thanks everybody for the advice, i think i&#39;ll look into paragraph rules it
    just might do the trick.

  body: 'Some brief, but recent, historical context: underlines came  <BR>about because
    typewriters didn&#39;t have italics or bold for  <BR>emphasis.  <BR> <BR>Now that
    we have italics and bold readily available,  <BR>underlines just remain a leftover
    convention; an  <BR>unnecessary homage to a time without an alternative. <BR>
    <BR>And it kills me that the web relies so heavily on these.  <BR>Down with underlines!
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m sure someone can point out a good use for them, <BR>but
    at the moment I can&#39;t think of one.&#41;'

  body: 'We used underlines in a brochure for a play at Schauspielhaus Bochum last
    year, as the text piece was a mock-up 70s style student/university- style. Bad
    Letter Gothic, Bad Letterspacing, too much text, awful image inserts and of course
    the inevitable underlining of whatever text the author deems important. Funny
    as hell, I still wonder who got the gag at all :-&#41;... but other than that
    and apart from other cool visual ideas to be done with it,  underlining should
    be taboo in regular typesetting... '
