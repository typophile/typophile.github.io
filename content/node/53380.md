body: I would like to receive your feedback on this logo I've designed recently. The
  font is sightly modified and made more dinamic. I am specially interested about
  your impressions on the kerning or the overall look of the name. Thank you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dlogo_4806.jpg]

  body: To me, it loks like the D could go just a hair to the right, and the A (and
    thus the L) should move to the left a little

  body: Is that the S that comes with the typeface? It feels really clunky in there.

    be modified."

  body: "Luciano, as you probably know, it's a foregone conclusion that you won't
    find a consensus of opinion about letterspacing -- and it's not just a matter
    of taste, or variations in the letterspacing sensitivity of various contributors
    (although both of these are important factors); but there is also the question
    of whether or not you take into account the interior spacing of the letters as
    you adjust the spacing between the letters. Some do, some don't.\r\n\r\nFor what
    it\u2019s worth, here are my thoughts: I don't agree that the D needs to be moved
    to the right. If anything, it needs to move to the left a little. But the main
    problem for me is that the letters ISU seem to me to be significantly tighter
    that either the letters at the beginning and end of the word.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: I think that, from a type design perspective, the cohesion of the letters
    is so wunky that a different face should be chosen as a starting point. The weight
    of the heavy serifs (proper term?) on the S vs L are mismatched, the inner counters/arcs
    between D U and S are inconsistent, and the blunt apexes on the A and V seems
    out of place to me. Also the S seems to wide.

  body: Thank you all for the comments, I tried to take into account each suggestion,
    although it was hard to make a equilibrate choice between them. Here is the result
    in this phase, I've touched the S a bit and kerned them a little. Looking forward
    to new impressions.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dlogo3_5202.jpg]

  body: "AtoZ is right. The result is better. For my taste the V is still too narrow,
    also the U. S is better but still too wide, and i\u2019d trim its serifs in length.
    And i don\u2019t like the right serif of the L."

  body: "Congratulations, much improved. Letterspacing is still not quite perfect,
    but you'll have to decide how much time you want to invest. If I were going to
    fiddle a little more, I would tighten up the DIV a little. The S is much better
    looking.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When
