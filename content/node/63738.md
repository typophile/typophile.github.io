body: "So this little one sprung out of the experiments with Mint and Mode. It struck
  me on the bus to try a stripped-down sans with just the underlying structure of
  the other two, and none of the experimental features such as active counters, flared
  strokes and rounded terminals.\r\n\r\nThe result is a rather clean (bland?) looking
  font that doesn't do too well in running text due to its large x-height and rather
  oversized counters. I did the numbers from scratch as they weren't somehow too transposeable.
  Some of the glyphs have been slightly reinvented too (b, e, t).\r\n\r\nI can't quite
  tell if this reminds me of some other font. It's a bit like Gill Sans in uppercase,
  Meta or Kievit in lowercase, and there seem to be hints of Bliss, Cosmos and Trebuchet
  too. B and D look a bit Helvetican. I'm not sure if all those things make it look
  like a jumbled mess or a harmonious blend, but I'm sure the Typophiles can answer
  that ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Melon_6219.gif]"

  body: Huh. It's actually not too bad although it has a bit of that straight up "utilitarian"
    feel to it - kind of like the vibe Myriad gives off. I'm interested in where this
    might lead! Next thing you'll be doing another experiment by adding slab serifs...

  body: "Yeah, I'm not sure how pleasant I find it. The overall feel is not very memorable
    or characterful. Partly I think the problem is I didn't have a clear concept or
    purpose for it so it's a bit vacant looking. And partly I just don't like the
    way I've resolved some of the shapes, they're just a bit clunky. A bit like a
    watermelon that looks sweet, juicy and refreshing but turns out to be a bit hard
    and watery.\r\n\r\nI think the caps have a potentially interesting voice, kind
    of cross between geometric and humanist.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll continue with
    this one for now, not unless I have a sudden burst of inspiration. It would need
    a new lowercase, or at least a significantly smaller x-height and perhaps narrower
    proportions, before I felt comfortable with it. Still, a worthwhile learning experience
    and wow! the first time I've been able to feel like a font is done as far as I
    want!"

  body: "When I view the running text sample at 100%, it has a friendly, bouncy, jovial
    quality to it.  That quality is partly due to the big round letterforms but also
    due to some serendipitous technical difficulty with hinting or antialiasing or
    something, so that round forms are made noticeably taller than non-round ones.
    \ This \"feature\" disappears at larger sizes, which I think is a pity as it makes
    the text much less visually engaging.  I'd kind of like to see the bounciness
    made an integral feature of the font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/melon_100_pct_6110.png]"

  body: "Ok, finding I can't put this one away. I haven't done a clean sans before
    and it's quite tempting to try and resolve this.\r\n\r\nHey Martijnm thanks! Yeah,
    the e is a bit crap. I can't visualise what shape's going to work best. I think
    the g is probably the worst glyph, I might have to change it to a single-storey
    version to make it work properly.\r\n\r\nRegards bubbliness, it looks like the
    overshoot hasn't been rendered quite right with the auto alignment zones. But
    I see the effect is interesting \u2014 maybe I'll lower the crossbars of f and
    t slightly below the x-height.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh, you know what, those crossbars
    are already quite a lot lower than the x-height. That would explain it :)"

  body: "A few suggestions to take or leave:\r\n\r\nH - maybe very slightly too wide?\r\nQ
    - tail's exit from the bowl looks indecisive. Perhaps intersection point at bottom
    should be at a more emphatic angle, or changed to a smooth.\r\nS - top counter
    looks bigger than bottom - in the lowercase, too. Is that intended?\r\nU - a touch
    narrow?\r\ne - eye looks too big as my printer renders it at 9pt, but other sizes
    are okay so maybe this is a hinting issue? And Martijn is right about the strange
    drawing up top.\r\nf - hook looks a bit cramped. If the x-height stays in this
    proportion, might you want to open up that space by having the hook come down
    less far? Also see t.\r\ng - tail looks too rectangular for this font\r\ns - see
    S.\r\nt - yes, I've always thought that crossbar was too low.\r\ny - / stroke
    looks light, and not steep enough?\r\nperiod, comma - need to be bigger, and more
    distinct from one another\r\n\r\nI think the figures look very strong. 6/9 are
    great. Perhaps the five's acute angle comes down too far? \r\n\r\nI notice the
    little obliqueness to the terminals of the legs of R and K. Is that something
    you thought of trying with other diagonals, too?\r\n\r\nMore generally, I think
    this x-height works well at smaller sizes but those extenders start to look pretty
    stunted once it's up beyond small text sizes."
