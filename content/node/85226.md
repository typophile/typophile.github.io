  number\r\n4. Clicking \"Rename next glyph\"\r\n5. Repeat for all small caps\r\n\r\nIt's
  important that the glyph will be renamed in all OT-code and classes aswell, so just
  deleting the suffix wont work. I want the kerning to move with the renaming.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, much appriciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/renam02830_3565.png]"

  body: This may be a dumb question, but why rename them at all? If all the lowercase
    characters are small caps, does it make any difference what they're named?

  body: Nick, clever idea! Keep the glyph names as they are, only assign unicode values
    to "a.small", "b.small" etc. instead of "a", "b" etc.

  body: "Hmm, Wouldnt that also take some time? Sort of the same amount of time it
    takes to do this little manual process.\r\n\r\nSince I dont know the unicode numbers
    in my head I have to look them up first, and then enter them manually to the small
    caps slots.\r\n\r\nOr is there an easier way?\r\n"

  body: "It would take some time, but only once ;) You could copy and edit one of
    FontLab\u2019s naming files (.nam) in /Library/Application Support/FontLab/Mapping
    so that includes the small cap names instead of the lowercase names:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n%%FONTLAB
    NAMETABLE: Small Caps\r\n0x0020 space\r\n0x0021 exclam\r\n0x0022 quotedbl\r\n[...]\r\n0x0041
    A\r\n0x0042 B\r\n0x0043 C\r\n[...]\r\n0x0061 a.small\r\n0x0062 b.small\r\n0x0063
    c.small\r\n0x0064 d.small\r\n0x0065 e.small\r\n[...]\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n... and
    then use this file via the menu Glyph -> Glyph Names -> Generate Unicode to reassign
    the unicode values in the current font.\r\n\r\nBy the way, good luck for Letters
    From Sweden :)"

    luck. If it doesnt work, I can always start submitting fonts to Google instead
