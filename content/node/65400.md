  body: "I started by looking for 3D fonts, but I think this is actually a layered
    font. The bottom layer has a diagonal line fill. You could probably create a similar
    effect with any cartoon font of your choice. I did look at Cartoon and Comic categories
    at Dafont, but I was looking for this effect and not for the letterforms.\r\n\r\n-
