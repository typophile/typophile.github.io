  body: I wish this triple thing would stop. I guess it just happens with me. I only
    press once, then I get the server error. A nightmare <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve just found out that If I stop the process,
    I only get one post. Could someone fix this situation?

    <BR> <BR>Hello Yves, <BR> <BR>I just received your email about the Soda logo,
    which  <BR>i made while i was a graphic designer for them. <BR>It&#39;s not a
    font, but custom made letters made in Illustrator. <BR> <BR>Soda wanted a design
    with a retro-feel to it, so i studied  <BR>50&#39;s lettering and came up with
    these oval shapes. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps? <BR> <BR>Kind regards, <BR>Stine
