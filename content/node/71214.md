  for Mecanorma.\r\n\r\nAll I have left of that typeface are some remaining characters
  on a \"Dry Transfer Lettering sheet\".\r\n\r\nIt is similar (but certainly not the
  same) to typeface Telecast:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/device_fonts/telecast_regular/\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate it if someone could help me get the Tele-vision typeface."

    of each characters equal to the typeface Television but has very irregular outlines
    of the individual stripes. I assume it is a bad copy...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.1001freefonts.com/BoobToob.php "

  body: "Oh, that's an awful version there. \r\n\r\nHaving scanned it for you at 2400
    dpi, I had a good look at it, I was hoping it was made up of uniform elements
    of thin and thick lines, but unfortunately it's not. They're completely random,
    the lengths of the thin protrusions are different everywhere and the thickness
    and curve of the thick lines is completely random depending on the letter. Even
    tidying it up in Photoshop would take me weeks."
