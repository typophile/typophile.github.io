    this site was IMHO the BEST of all messaging social networking sites.\r\n\r\nThere
    wouldn't have been a Twitter without Typophile. Anyone who tells you any different
    ain't tellin' the truth. ;)"

  body: So I could post here, which would post to Twitter. I could then set up Twitter
    to automatically post to Facebook. Is there an app to turn Facebook posts into
    LinkedIn updates? And then I could have it update MySpace...
