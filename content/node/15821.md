body: "This logo is for use on a software system that focuses on bringing different
  groups together and enabling them to form a consensus opinion about some topic.
  The software allows groups to post opinions in essay form, with each group member
  voting on which essay best describes their position. Through constant feedback between
  groups, a consensus is reached. In theory.\r\n\r\nI've used the idea of a venn-diagram,
  where two sides are presented and join in the middle, establishing a common ground,
  or a common voice. The name itself doesn't mean anything, it's just some unspecific
  title that's friendly and unobtrusive. I guess. Stupid name if you ask me, especially
  since this software is targeted at government agencies and corporate committees.
  If I go into detail with it I will not stop.\r\n\r\nThoughts on concept, form, and
  color are more than welcome!"

  body: "The concept itself is nice. I like the venn reference and the discussion
    aspect comes into play nicely with the word balloons. The balloon over the J looks
    a bit disjointed and improperly spaced to me, but the one over the I looks fine.\r\n\r\nThe
    only issue I have is the color. I'd opt for more saturation. Lively discussion
    and a lively mark. Your Starcom work is a good example of what I would envision,
    but to an extreme extent. That might be a little too much for a government agency
    targeted piece of software."

    \ They remind me of camouflage, but considering the mood of the government these
    days, it might be a match made in heaven! \r\nD~"

    one with red+blue=purple and yellow+blue=green and they weren't working very well.
    The current colors are adjusted from a client-provided spec. Lemme see what I
    can do with the colors. \r\n\r\nGood catch with the balloon over the \"j\". I'll
    fix that."

    a more saturated version of your first blue color?

    Maybe one can be a bit bigger than the other. Are you feeling pretty close to
    done or do you want a type crit too?

  body: I do like the colors, but not for this project. The problem is that if you
    consider that your software is about conversation you probably want to think of
    positive colors. These colors as they are seem depressing.

  body: "I'm with Tiffany. Save those colors for another project. I like both, but
    the word balloon one seems more interesting/meaningful.\r\n\r\nThe 'j' feels weird
    to me. I want it to connect, but then it might be too close/confusing. However,
    adding space may make it feel disconnected. Perhaps the 'o' and 'd' need to be
    pulled apart a bit? It's also possible your solution represents a happy medium.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    try bringing the word baloons down a bit closer to the words. Or perhaps the lefthand
    one should just feel a bit more connected to the 'j'."

  body: "Revised GIF is up top in first post.\r\n\r\nI adjusted the left bubble and
    its relationship with the \"j\". I also eliminated the color bundles and tried
    it out with one color and 50% of that color. I think it's much clearer this way,
    but I am trying a 2-color solution as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am completely
    open to criticism on form, type, color, concept. I'm using Dolly Bold, in case
    you're keeping track at home. \r\n\r\nThe adjusted bubbles might clear up the
    weirdness of the unattached \"j\" a little, but I've been staring at this thing
    so long I don't know anymore.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help, by the way!"

    it in context, so take that with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nIs there a specific reason
    for getting rid of the dots on the letters? It might serve your purpose more overtly
    to leave them on (reading like conversing people)."

  body: What if the the jo & di where not speaking but being spoken - What if you
    had a logo of two voice ballooons but the the type inside. That would be visually
    simpler and would 'read' faster. I would also encourage you to let one of the
    balloons be more obviously larger than the other. The sizes seem a little too
    equivacal to me now. And what about the b/w version? It seems like any logo worth
    the name needs to work well in b/w. I think a logo that has to do with speaking
    aught to have a warmer tone overall. What about basic corporate black & red (
    with b/w too) ?

  body: the j and i could have connected descenders that loop around top to create
    a head. Their dots then look like eyes and the o and d would look like nostrils.
    I drew it up, but it is less evident than the current scheme and a lot more whimsical.
    There are a lot of possibilities with this.

  body: "New GIF in original post.\r\n\r\nAlright. Had to make some decisions. Client
    also had some input. I wanted to see what the talk-bubbles would look like with
    dots on the j and i, and client wanted non-bold type and a direction that used
    circles instead of letterforms for venn-diagrams.\r\n\r\nI prefer the new talk-bubble
    one, #1 because it allows the type to breath and doesn't have an overpowering
    visual weight.\r\n\r\nI hate #3 and #4, especially #4, but I'm scared that it'll
    get chosen because he's got his mind set on it. Any ideas about making #3 and
    \ #4 better? \r\n\r\nMain things to consider still: This is corporate-committee
    software, clients espouses venn-diagrams, and these are final directions.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think #2 is your top pick & you have shown it works nicely in b/w!\r\n\r\nI
    think the #1 reason 3& 4 can't be viable is the MasterCard Logo. If they get litigious

    legal issues aside jodi is a small brand & masercard a big one and you dont want
    to raise any brand confusion in your solution. So for both reasons I would counsel
    your client to avoid that particular direction. \r\n\r\nWhat if you had 3 or 4
    \ or 5 voice ballons? And inside the nexus it said 'jodi'? The triangle shaped
    voice sources could all draw down to some common point below or in the middle
    or you could arrange them like flower petals with the radii comming from tthe
    outside.\r\n\r\nThat would maybe position jodi as consensus in a way that isn't
    suggested by the current arrangment of parts. Can two people have a consensus?
    Don't they just agree?"
