  which is probably true as it was commissioned from a branding company for a tailor-shop.\r\nI
  am just curious if anyone can point me to anything very similar - or if it possibly
  exists in digital form as a serial font. I have done some online searching through
  some old Tuscans & slab-serifs (as per suggested by my friend) but haven't encountered
  anything that suits my fancy as much as this one.\r\nAlso - if this is indeed just
  some fancy-pants hand-lettering - are there any copyright issues with 'ripping'
  it off? Or perhaps 'ripping' aspects of it?\r\nForgive these if they are amateur
  questions, I know next to nothing about typography. All I know is I adore this font
  and want to get my grabby hands all over it for the purposes of a website.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any advice!\r\n\r\nDani[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nortonsons_identity_6_4033.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

  body: "This doesn't look especially familiar, so my suggestion is to find a roughly
    similar slab serif and customize the serifs to look like these. The O's are a
    special case, but I think you could move some outline points to create the indented
    notches.\r\n\r\nI notice that the S is oddly upside-down looking, so you might
    also flip the S in the font you choose.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
