  body: "Seems like a much better case for sticking with free fonts and avoiding commercial
    fonts altogether. Why pay Typotheque's prices when you can get more and more good
    looking, well crafted fonts for free or nearly free?\r\n\r\nAlso, as the complaint
    makes clear, those who merely visited the Santorum site while the fonts were being
    used (allegedly) are being characterized as infringers and the defendant in the
    case is being asked to provide IP addresses and other identifying information.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so, down the same path that has been trod fruitlessly by the music and movie industries
    Typotheque walks. But for Typotheque there's only one problem: they are not part
    of a giant oligopoly.\r\nNow Typotheque is on the \"don't buy\" blacklist and
    there sure are plenty of other places to go for fonts. Nice job!\r\n\r\n(Santorum's
    site is currently using Typekit - BTW)\r\n\r\nUntil the complaint is amended,
    and Typotheque's position is made clear, my recommendation is that nobody buy
    fonts from Typotheque or use their service, either. (Sorry, Peter.)\r\nThe suit
    is a slap in the face of every web developer and every web user everywhere. According
    to the suit, if I had visited Santorum's site during the period those fonts were
    included in the @font-face rules, I'm an infringer because my browser cached them.\r\nScrew
    'em and the lawyer they rode in on.\r\n\r\nFrank Martinez, BTW, is the lawyer
    they rode in on. And, as one would infer from the information posted on Martinez'
    own website, I beg to differ with Stephen - this suit seems more like a bottom-feeding
    IP lawyer trying to use the legal costs of defending against a complaint to extract
    a quick settlement. As was done, successfully I've heard - but I don't know the
    settlement amount - by Martinez when he represented the Font Bureau against NBC.\r\nThe
    <strong>real</strong> pirates are the ones who know how to craftily use the legal
    system to their benefit. Downloaders are pikers but add up the sheer number of
    them and you get Spotify.\r\nMonitoring and targeting deep pocket defendants goes
    on in the copyright industry all the time.\r\n\r\nAs for Extensis' blog post:\r\n\r\nExtensis'
    product won't protect you from mistakes that lie outside it's reach. Or a misunderstanding
    of the license terms. I was kind of waiting for them to pick up on this and use
    it as marketing fodder - and I'm glad they did. Now I hope one of their licensees
    gets sued and Extensis gets sued for promising to protect their licensees from
    this sort of thing. After discussing the Santorum situation for three paragraphs
    or so it seques into this:\r\n<em>\"Universal Type Server can help you gain control
    of the fonts used in your workgroup. Through robust tracking and reporting you
    can ensure that you\u2019ve purchased enough licenses for your workgroup, and
    keep unlicensed fonts from entering your workflow.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThis is spin
    verging on a lie.\r\nWhat's described offers absolutely no protection against
    the kind of suit under discussion. Did Kidwell even read the complaint before
    writing it? (Sorry Jim, but <strong>did</strong> you bother to read the complaint
    so you'd know what you were writing about?)\r\n\r\nYou can all read (and download)
    the actual complaint filed in the United States District Court and decide for
    yourselves:\r\n<a href=\"http://readableweb.com/downloads/typo-complaint.pdf\">Typotheque
    VOF v RaiseDigital </a>\r\n\r\n"
