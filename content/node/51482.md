  uses Caslon, specifically Adobe Caslon Pro. (other Caslons will work too, though...
  and I'm American, if it matters.)\r\n\r\nI know George Bernard Shaw used exclusively
  Caslon, but I'm not sure if his works in print still do.\r\n\r\nThank you so much
  for the help!"

    links supplied above by Manlio and John, I easily found two of the few books I've
    ever designed in Adobe Caslon.\r\n\r\nOne is \"Boosters, Hustlers, and Speculators,\"
    by Jocelyn Wills:\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=8OH2OdbE5FgC&pg=PA292&dq=%22adobe+caslon%22&lr=#PPP1,M1\r\n\r\nGoogle
    only shows the dubble-col backmatter notes and bibliography, though, no text pages.
    (It is a business history of Minneapolis & St. Paul: yawn).\r\n\r\nThe other is
    a book of wonderful poems by Mary Leader, \"Red Signature\" (one of the most enjoyable
    design projects I've ever had). This does not seem to show any text pages, though
    Amazon does (poorly).\r\n\r\nSince Taryn is near a university, I bet an inter-library
    loan could get these books easily enough.\r\n\r\npowers"
