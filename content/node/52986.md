  body: "The book may have been rebound at a library.\r\nI worked in a library for
    a while in 1969, and there was a bookbinder on staff, who had a collection of
    letter punches which he would stamp with gold foil into the front cover and spine
    of rebound books.\r\nRather than throw out an old soft-cover book, it would be
    hard-bound.\r\nAlso useful for putting titles on the spine of spineless books,
    to make them easier to sort etc. on shelves.\r\nPerhaps some old bookbinder (like
    my Mr Tibbs) let a young lad have a go at some lettering--just to demonstrate
    the skill involved.\r\nEither that, or he was nursing a hip flask which spiked
    his sense of humour."
