  sizes (36 pt. and 42 pt.) of a face called \"Spike Gothic.\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone give
  me more information about it? I've never seen it before and would like to know more
  about it. Any digital versions? A quick Google search didn't turn up anything.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpikeGothic_4601.JPG]"

    with Intertype stuff. May be a knockoff, but I haven\u2019t seen this design."

  body: "likewise, never seen it; never even noticed it in many passes through Intertype\u2019s
    specimens. The work of some anonymous drawing office draftsman. Makes me wonder
    if there\u2019s an archive of Intertype master drawings, and documents such as
    the Museum of Printing holds for Linotype."

      The mystery continues...\r\n\r\nAs far as I have heard, nothing was really saved
      when Intertype shut down, especially something like the Linotype drawings at
      the MoP."

    though you already know the name you may find someone who can give you more on
    the history of the font. There are some metal guys who read that forum and they
