  Script</a></strong> is the new project of the Sudtipos foundry, based on the ornate
  lettering of calligraphy teacher Louis Madarasz (1859\u20131910). As with previous
  major type releases, we invited some very talented artists to collaborate on the
  <strong><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/download/pdf/burguesscript.pdf\">PDF type
  guide</a></strong>. Thanks to Horacio Lardies, Florencia Kohan, Mariano Lopez Hiriart
  and Jose Ignacio Fernandez, who illustrated the words that Alejandro Paul designed.\r\n"
