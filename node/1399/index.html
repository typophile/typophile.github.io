Has anyone thought of helping to elevate the knowlege of DTP font junkies who don't know what they're downloading. My thought is to have someone that really knows what they are talking about take 1 or 2 of those free/shareware fonts per week and let those of us that can't see the little bump on the diagonal stroke of a K what's good or bad about that font. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of, course, I would recommend using the ones that weren't obviously bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I realize that most of you that visit this site are type experts, but I've seen (and posted) some questions that indicate a lack of expertise in the fine points of type. A lot of &quot;Susie/Sam&quot; secretary types are being forced to produce things that they have absolutely no training for. Think about all those horrible websites you've visited with 50 different fonts and not a single headline kerned. UGH! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some of the free fonts appear to be really good in their photoshop rendition at the download but print awful when you use them. Maybe also include things like what's the difference between using a Bitstream font vs a Pizzadude font that look about the same. Maybe I'm the only font junkie who knows enough to be dangerous but not enough to know the difference between dentation and hinting. (Okay, I know the difference, but I looked it up).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know quite a bit on how to design with type, but maybe not why mixing a slab serif with grotesque is visually pleasing. Instead of trying every font in my repertoire which, believe me, can take hours; I, and possible others as well, might like to know why they work together. Therefore  being able to make more informed type choices the next time they're asked to design work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's just an idea to help raise the bar of good design and type usage. Any thoughts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj, Thanks for the reading list! I'll add the ones that I haven't already read (gratifyingly few) to my list. typographi.ca is on my list and so is Briem. I have been using the Books section here as a checklist already. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think that I like Dawn's idea of Good Type Bad Type so much because (as I understand it) she's asking for very specific examples. The only example I have seen of a comparison between a Good Type and a rip-off is in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Branding With Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Adobe press and it has only a single example, useful but not detailed. I imagine comparisons of set text, and detailed close-ups on the parts of the letterforms as is regularly done in the Critiques forums. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bringhurst is the only one I have read so far that expresses his approach to type selection, not counting Tschihold's simple perscription in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I know there will be more information about selecting type as I continue my research and education, but what do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks again for your suggestions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon</div>

In my working as both tech support and graphic support for several large companies and schools, I've just found that the people who get thrust into these situations aren't truly equipped to do their jobs, nor do they know where to go. When I was first learning there weren't as many resources to get both good and bad info from. I'd like to have a place where I can refer myself and those I support to find out about type and how to really use it correctly, creatively, and ethically from people that know the best way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16689.html?1064504736">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16689.html?1064504736</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a thread of a college student trying to find out the impact of type. Type is no longer restricted to print, it is a myriad of multifaceted tentacles that reach everywhere. And many of us out here are one man bands. I design, program, write, self-train, purchase, install and support everything I do from my kitchen table. If you design in a workplace, you can go to the cubicle next to you and white board with the designer next to you.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The value and the talent that is available at this site in incredible. The opportunity to learn from some of the best in the field is exciting and humbling. I'd love to be able to read every book on typography, web design, css, html programming, javascripting, network solutions, etc. to do my job properly, but if you check some of my postings, I really need that hour of sleep. I admit I understand type and have several books not just on typography but the history of type as well, but it's not MY area of expertise. In addition, I and others in my same situation just don't have the time to do our work and read every new book on the market and decide which book has good info and which one doesn't. Sometimes 20 min online can educate me as much as spend 2 days reading a huge book. Resources are the key to doing great design, and after 20 years of doing graphics and pc admin, these resources provide inspiration and an opportunity to learn no ways to improve my work! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Fredrik! It sure is fantastic to see these examples like this. Am I seeing that right: there's actually a point in the lower right of the counter in 9 in the 353 example? Those mumerals are kind of whacky with what appears to be a really narrow 3, an extremely wide 4, and an apparent decrease in bowl size from 5 to 6. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would anybody happen to have an example of output from a rip-off of Gill Sans or Humanist to compare to these lovely examples?</div>
