body: "The last time I posted about this subject, it didn\u2019t get much traction,
  which is unfortunate, because of what I am about to relate.\r\n\r\nSome twenty-odd
  years ago, I worked as Art Director for an independent television station owned
  by Taft Broadcasting of Ohio, which was a family concern. Taft was Old School, and
  placed a high value on its employees, providing generous benefits and a defined
  benefits pension plan. It came to pass that the station was purchased in a Leveraged
  Buy-Out (LBO). The new owners had a quite different view of employees\u2014they
  were considered more or less a necessary nuisance\u2014and the benefits were trimmed
  back substantially and the pension plan was discontinued. Furthermore, rumors circulated
  that staff cuts were immanent and, in a stroke of cut-throat genius, the new management
  asked every employee to write his or her own job description. Thus, employees who
  did not wish to see their eliminated, padded their job descriptions so as to appear
  indispensable. And, thus, when the staff cuts did come, each employee remaining
  was saddled with more work than he or she could possibly do, yet had claimed was
  part of their job. As I said: cut-throat genius. As if to rub salt in the wound,
  the new General Manager bragged that the owners had learned these little tricks
  at industry conferences for LBO firms: a new generation of employers were thoroughly
  trained in how to screw their employees.\r\n\r\nIn another thread, I mentioned that,
  twice in the past month, I had been approached by vendors who wished to license
  my fonts, but only under a license of their devising. In both cases, the licenses
  extended to any and all media \u201Ccurrently known or yet to be devised.\u201D
  In other words, the licensees were looking for obsolescence insurance at cut-rate
  prices. The fact that two different vendors asked for licenses containing precisely
  the same terms leads me to believe that similar seminars, conferences and/or workshops
  are encouraging potential licensees to seek these terms in order to pre-empt the
  inevitable costs of the font subscription licensing model which will inevitably
  evolve with the cloud computing model.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had similar terms
  proposed to them? Isn\u2019t this an issue which we, the fontmaking community are
  going to have to deal with, or am I simply delusional? Any and all opinions on the
  subject are welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nWhen I worked as a TV puppeteer I was once asked to cede my performance
    rights \"in perpetuity, across the universe.\" I attempted, unsuccessfully, to
    talk them down to \"an eon, across the galaxy\"."
