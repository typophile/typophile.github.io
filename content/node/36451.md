  body: "Depending on whether you want a contemporary or antique feel, you could also
    look through the Script Font ID Guide <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script13Pg1.html\">Parts
    13 (Ornate)</a> and <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script10Pg1.html\">10
    (Antique)</a> for some more ideas, many of which have been mentioned. Some of
    the T-26 Scripts can look pretty exotic, like Escrita, which has multiple forms,
    and they often come as a surprise to people who don't usually think of them as
    a source for script fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
