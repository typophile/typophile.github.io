  translations). I was alerted by our French copy editor that traditionally, extra
  space (thin space) is used on either side of certain characters such as \";\", \"?\",
  and \":\". See: http://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/bien-well/fra-eng/typographie-typography/ponctesp-poncspac-fra.html\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if this is still considered best practice, or, as I suspect, more of
  a formal rule that can be adjusted based on the specifics of layout and typeface
  choices.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nJeff"

    information on the <a href=\"http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?T1=espace&T3.x=0&T3.y=0\">OLF
    site</a>:  on your noslangues.gc.ca link, it is explicitly said that the thin
    space is about 25% of a normal space; on the corresponding link of the Office

    r\xE9duite\", a reduced space; nothing is said on how much it is expected to be
    reduced. On a site in France I have seen that the thin space should be about 50%
    the width of the normal space. With LaTeX, I get a thin space that is 0.167 of
    an em, which may be quite large for some fonts; for instance with Arno Pro, I
    get a normal space of less than 0.2 of an em so that the thin space is about 83%
    of a normal space, which is too much for me. Here is a test with pdfLaTeX using
    Arno Pro installed for LaTeX. First the input file (using texlive 2012 and my

    first line uses 0.16657 of an em, the second 50% of the normal space, the third

    with the french option is that it first removes all space between the last letter
    and the punctuation mark (semicolon, question or exclamation mark) and then it
    positively kerns  the mark, the kerning being done (indirectly) by the <code>\\thinspace</code>
    command that I, maybe unorthodoxly, redefined above.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I heard
    that inDesign has a \"grep\" command. Is it then not possible, using a properly

    offset them 15 or 20/1000 units to the right. Similarly, I always give more space

  body: I generally set semicolon and colon wider than comma and period. The potential
    pitfall of offsetting the colon to the right is that it will not be centered between
    figures when setting times, as in 10:00 for instance. But I suppose adding a standard
    positive kern for colon-@figures to offset the offset is not too burdensome.

    (\u2013) in place of an em dash (\u2014) in offset statements and interjections?
    I am seeing some conflicting advice on this. The manuscript I received from our

    length and separated by a  <em>trait d'union</em> (hyphen) (1965-1978 instead
    of 1965-78). The same rule is given in my 1976 edition of the \"Lexique des r\xE8gles

    The entry <a href=\"http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?t1=1&id=3378\">Tiret
    : g\xE9n\xE9ralit\xE9s</a> of the OQLF simply states that it is longer than the

    my 1976  edition of \"Lexique\" would have used an em-dash instead.\r\n\r\nThings
    \ get tricky when there are dialogues, where the em-dash seems to be preferred.
    I have found sites (a full course on typography in Belgium, links in France and
    Qu\xE9bec) stating that  the em-dash is to be used for dialogues and the en-dash
    for other instances of <em>tiret</em>. <a href=\"http://correcteurs.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/09/01/le-cadratin-\u2014-dans-tous-ses-etats/

    arguing that there is just one <em>tiret</em> in French and you choose either
    the en-dash or the em-dash. The same blog states that use of the em-dash has almost
    disappeared from the press. I had a look at a few of my books and found five from
    different editors (two from Qu\xE9bec, three from France) that use the em-dash,
    and two others (one from Qu\xE9bec, one from France) that use the en-dash (consistently,
    so far as I could see).\r\n"
