body: "I've been asked to do some work for a small company, and they don't have a
  clue what font was used to make their logo \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whatfont_3574.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  a long shot, but does anyone recognise the font? They're unfortunately not open
  to a redesign, so I need to find the font sharpish.\r\n\r\nYou can see it at www.millgate.co.uk
  (just the font that is used as their logo)\r\n\r\nHope someone can help!"
