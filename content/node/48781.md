  only the regular weight, but plan to have at least a bold and light.\r\n\r\nThis
  same design was posted earlier under the name Marua, but the name didn't stick.\r\n\r\nI'm
  still in the process of spacing and kerning, but thought I'd post a more refined
  version of what I posted before. Any comments would be lovely."

  body: "Hi Arlo\r\n\r\nProbably wouldn't hook the b, h and k - not sure you need
    to and the l and d would fit better. Maybe that's just me.\r\n\r\nC and c (and
    G and G.sc) bottom strokes come out too far in my head.\r\n\r\nShould your y look
    more similar to the v (and w and x)?\r\n\r\nAll O's (and Q's) look egg-shaped
    to me... is that deliberate?\r\n\r\nStruggling with the vertical alignment of
    the 4's: I know why the lining 4 sticks up above caps line but it ought not to.
    Maybe lower the cross bar on the old style (or raise the vertical stroke on the
    lining 4) and the problem might go away.\r\n\r\nFir info, Q.sc has dropped down
    slightly.\r\n\r\nFine work. I particularly love the punctuation marks."

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nThanks for the critique. It seems that it's been pretty light
    in this area. Or maybe it's just what I post. lol.\r\n\r\nI don't think the hooks
    on the b, h and k affect too much of the readability at small sizes and they add
    a little more character when at larger sizes. (I did try it though, but the overall
    effect seemed more flat)\r\n\r\nI adjusted the C, c and G, G.sc just the slightest
    bit and it did help the overall width feel better. Nice catch.\r\n\r\nI'm not
    sure if I follow what you mean by egg-shaped. They are intentionally not circular,
    but more ovular.\r\n\r\nAnd another good catch on the 4 and the Q.sc. Both have
    been adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to have the complete character set
    ready within the next couple days."

  body: By egg-shaped I mean slightly more pointed at the top than at the bottom.
    Is that deliberate?

  body: "Very nice.\r\n\r\nA small thing that I noticed is that the hooks on all the
    characters occur a bit too high which from a distance makes it appear more angled
    rather than curved. ie. 'u' 'h' 'k'."

  body: The only part of it that doesn't quite sit right with me is the middle of
    the w. Somehow it seems to create the illusion that the middle reaches higher
    than either side.

  body: Good catch Kevin. I optically adjust the W but totally overlooked the w. I'll
    add that to the list of changes. It's so nice to have fresh eyes noticing things
    I overlook. Thanks to everyone for the comments.

  body: I've uploaded the latest round of changes. The newest PDF has the complete
    character set as it stands now. There were a couple things I noticed right away
    that I'll have to go in and change. It'll be interesting to see if anybody can
    point them out.

  body: "Names and dates on page 2 and 3!\r\n\r\nAEacute, aeacute, aeacute.sc missing?
    Oslashacute, oslashacute, oslashacute.sc missing?\r\n\r\nFor completeness, f_b,
    f_f_b, f_h, f_f_h, f_thorn, f_f_thorn ligatures? Maybe not necessary but some
    include those.\r\n\r\nWould like to see a lowercase j with same structure as f
    but rotated, roughly speaking. \r\n\r\nAlso, don't think the long J (as used in
    I_J) fits that well with the rest of set. It's the one character which loojks
    like it has come from a different font in my mind.\r\n\r\nQuite like the staggered
    double quotes, however, isn't the implication that the single quotes need to stagger
    too for the sake of rotational logic? Second thoughts, you've probably got it
    right; just making sure you've thought it through.\r\n\r\nGood work, Arlo. Looks
    lovely set in copy.\r\n\r\n"

    a couple characters I wasn't totally happy with\u2014another good catch with the
    long J; Eng and eng as well as the j and the IJ ij glyphs. Overall I'm pretty
    happy. Again, thanks to everybody for the comments. Next step: kerning, ugh."
