  body: This poster is hand-lettered, but [[http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=pointy|pointy]]
    is kind of similar to what you're looking for. It's a little bolder and blockier,
    though.

  body: "As Eric notes, it's lettering, which is a part of its appeal--the way the
    letters are slightly different when they repeat, and the way some of them overlap.\r\n\r\nJustin,
    you're a bit of a polymath, why not take a crack at drawing your own version of
    this style?\r\n\r\nThen, if you want to digitize it, some font making software
    has auto-tracing, so you don't need crazy vector-drawing skills."
