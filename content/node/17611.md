    get in touch. It's not really a true flash solution, but it does use flash to
    display the type. It is very easy and flexible to set up though.\r\n\r\nEd \r\n\r\n<a

    (based on the MERL Saffron rendering engine). Flash 7 does not with their built-in
    dynamic text object, but a sufficiently enterprising programmer could probably
    hack up their own which draws the glyphs individually.\r\n"

    Things suddenly got busy for this afternoon and tomorrow. If it is OK if I get
    back to you on wednessday when I'll have a chance to make sure everything is up
    to date and working properly. I'm going to be away from the computer all tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI

    body: "It is not about kerning. Flash 8 has lots of great possibilities in terms
      of playing with fonts (letter spacing, kerning, and character positioning etc).
      But as you download my exe file from link above you might notice that some your
      fonts are not displayed properly in this application. It happens because flash
      does not display some PS fonts as well as others. Do not remember what is the
      problem (it was quite long time ageo though) anyway it looks like problem that
      cannot be solved so I left it.\r\nAnyway flash crashes if you are using ps fonts
      and do not have ps display drivers installed(come with ATM)\r\nSome info :)\r\nhttp://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_4105"
