  that can be compressed more than others ("m" for example) and still be readable.

  body: "Frutiger \u201Cs\u201D is quite narrow, its \u201Cw\u201D very wide, especially
    in the heavier weights.\r\n\r\nFutura capital L and T are very narrow.\r\n\r\nWhen
    designing monowidth faces, obviously \u201Cm\u201D and \u201Cw\u201D are problematic,
    but in my experience stretching letters, apart from \u201Ci\u201D and \u201Cl\u201D,
    is more of an issue."

  body: "Ah! it was from \"Balancing typeface legibility and economy\" by Victor Gaultney,
    speaking of Dwiggins' Eldorado:\r\n<cite>\"The greatest danger in condensed design
    is to compress everything. Dwiggins, on the other hand, carefully chose which
    letters to compress. Those letters which naturally respond well to compression
    \u2014 a f r s t \u2014 are thinned to the extreme, without diminishing critical
    features. Note the strong form of a and the sharp shoulder on f. Letters with
    counters, however, such as b d g o p q are given generous space. The diagonal
    strokes on v w x y are steep, making them narrower. He is also careful not to
    let the internal space of m and n get too small. All of these features work together
    to create a pleasant, readable face with no strong sense of compression.\"</cite>"

  body: "I think the important thing to keep in mind is that there's\r\nmore to \"compression\"
    than economy (which might seem\r\nlike the main goal here). Making certain letters
    narrower\r\nwhile leaving others \"wide\" increases divergence, which is\r\na
    help to readability. And when you decide to make an \"s\"\r\nfor example wider
    than it \"needs\" to be, for example to\r\ngive the font a certain character*,
    at least you're aware of\r\nthe little bit of functional damage you're doing.\r\n\r\n*
    This is what I did in Patria.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
