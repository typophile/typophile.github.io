body: 'Using my brand new copy of FontLab, I&#39;ve put together my first OpenType
  font. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I understand everything yet and I have a
  few questions for the experts. &#40;Please forgive me if these questions sound a
  little stupid.&#41; <BR> <BR>My font is a basic CFF .otf font with upper case characters
  and alternate figures. I use the aalt and salt OpenType features and it works in
  the FontLab preview on Panther. <BR> <BR>1&#41; I was surprised to see that 1/3rd
  of my applications have no idea what OpenType might be at all &#40;Word, etc.&#41;.
  1/3rd work just fine and I can access the alternate characters &#40;these are Adobe
  applications which seem to use their own font engine&#41; and the last third of
  my applications &#40;such as TextEdit, or Freeway&#41; claim that there are &#34;no
  typographic features&#34; in the font &#40;but I can use the character palette&#39;s
  glyph input to see the alternates&#41; . It seems that Apple wants me to put AAT
  tables in the font, but how can I add these tables? The Apple tools apparently only
  like TrueType flavored OpenType fonts? Help! <BR>My salt feature is really simple
  &#40;and accesses two FontLab classes&#41;: <BR>feature salt { # Stylistic Alternates
  <BR>  sub @figures by @altfigures; <BR>} salt; <BR> <BR>2&#41; To make the font
  more usable, I want to &#34;copy&#34; the upper case glyphs to lower case. I tried
  adding additional Unicode indexes as per page 95 of the FontLab manual. FontLab
  proudly shows the little &#34;D&#34; icon at both locations and the preview seems
  to indicate everything is fine. Unfortunately, applications only seem to display
  the first index and either nothing &#40;Adobe&#41; or the default Font &#40;Apple&#41;
  for the lower case!? I can of course cheat and just duplicate the glyph &#40;or
  use a &#34;composite&#34; with only one component&#41;. <BR> <BR>3&#41; When I add
  the OpenType &#34;size&#34; feature, FontLab crashes when compiling the features.
  Does anyone know whether that&#39;s a known problem &#40;or something FontLab just
  doesn&#39;t support&#41;, or should I report this? <BR>The following is the example
  from the Adobe web site. I removed the sizemenunames. <BR>feature size { <BR>parameters
  100  # design size &#40;decipoints&#41; <BR>3  # subfamily identifier <BR>80  #
  range start &#40;exclusive, decipoints&#41; <BR>139; # range end &#40;inclusive,
  decipoints&#41; <BR>} size; <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time! <BR>Robert'

  body: Apple&#39;s font tool DumpPOST creates a text file with the Postscript names
    for all the characters in the font. The PS names can be changed in a text editor
    and appended to the font with the AAT Font Tool. These are &#39;classic&#39;,
    pre-OSX applications. In OSX, ftxdumperfuser may do the same job &#40;I&#39;ve
    not used it&#41;.

  body: Robert, how are you making fonts with version 3 post tables? Just interested
    to know what your procedure is.

  body: <i>FontLab &#40;4.6, Mac&#41; just did it, it didn&#39;t ask...</i> <BR> <BR>It
    may be that, if making a PS OTF, FontLab writes the glyph names to the CFF table
    &#40;I believe there is a place to store them there&#41; and so writes a version
    3 post table. That actually makes sense. I mainly work with TrueType fonts, for
    which FontLab writes a version 2 post table. I recently had to make a TT font
    with a version 3 table, and ended up needing another tool to do this.
