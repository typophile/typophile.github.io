body: "Hello Forum,\r\n\r\nI am stuck at one point in FontLab and hope someone can
  help me. \r\nI would like to integrate arrows in a TrueType font using FontLab:
  arrow right and arrow left. \r\nThe font should be used as a webfont later and i
  don\xB4t want to build in images for arrows anymore.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this I proceeded
  as follows in FontLab: \r\n- Create a Glyph in an empty grey box wich is marked
  yellow in the font-window\r\n\tI understand that glyphs, that are not yellow do
  not belong to the currently selected encoding, codepage or Unicode range\r\n- then
  i rename the glypgh-name to \"arrowright\" (using the context-Menue) and generate
  the unicode index for it (2192) using the little diamond\r\n- After that action
  the Glyph is marked as grey (unencoded?) and it goes to the end-section in the font-window.\r\n\tThe
  arrow does not appear in the exported font. I tried TrueType and OpenType.\r\n\tThe
  font consist of 234 glyphs.\r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas, what i am doing wrong?\r\nDoes
  the unicode codepage not support arrows?\r\nI would be grateful for any hint.\r\n\r\nBarbara"

  body: "Since none of the more knowledgeable have replied, I'll give a try. What
    you have done should work, always assuming I've understood you aright.\r\n\r\nFirst
    of all, you are creating (generating) an OpenType font, right?  You're using  \r\n\r\nTrueType/OpenType
    TT\r\n\r\nin the \"save as type\" window.\r\n\r\nBeyond that:\r\n\r\n<cite>I understand
    that glyphs, that are not yellow do not belong to the currently selected encoding,
    codepage or Unicode range</cite> Yes, but this is only internal to FL's display.
    It is a convenience in using FL, not a requirement; the \"yellow\" has no other
    meaning.\r\n\r\nThe glyph should ultimately have a name of \"arrowright\" and
    a Unicode number of 2192, though actually, a <strong>name</strong> of \"uni2192\"
    is also correct. Make sure it shows in the metrics window, just as a check that
    everything's hooked up.\r\n\r\nThen, after you have saved the .vfb file and complied
    the features (if there are any), go to the preview panel, and type in\r\n\r\n\\2192\r\n\r\nIt
    should show. Check the name assignment by typing in\r\n\r\n/arrowright (or /uni2192,
    if you've *named* it that)\r\n\r\nYour character should show both times. It should
    also show in the metric window BTW, with the same strings.\r\n\r\nBTW-2 Unicode
    is not a \"codepage\" If you're filling in the File > Font Info > Encoding and
    Unicode section, I believe the conventional wisdom is to select \"Latin 1,\" and
    use \"Macintosh MacRoman\" for the Microsoft Character set. Though I know that
    \"Western (Latin1)\" also works...\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIf this is what you have
    done, then I'd ask what applications programs have you used to test the font where
    the character failed to appear?\r\n"

  body: "Dear Charles, \r\nthank you for your detailed answer!\r\nIt helped me very
    much, since i have not much to do with fonts.\r\n\r\nEspecially your last note
    has encouraged me to check the font (TrueType / OpenType TT) in the FontExplorer
    X Pro. There I could see that the name of the Arrow did not work, it was just
    empty (only the Glyph-ID has a number, but also a different one). Weird, because
    the Metric preview window displays everything correctly in FontLab. Also \"Latin
    1\" + \"MacRoman Macintosh\" are adjusted properly in the Font Info. \r\n\r\nThen
    I generated an OpenType font (OpenType PS) and the FontExplorer shows the names
    properly. After that i use Font Squirrel to generate the web font, and the arrow
    does not appear in the glyph overview of the demo HTML - despite the OpenType
    PS. Argh. I came up with the idea that this could be an issue of Font Squirrel
    and give another Generator a try (web-font-generator.com). Now it seems to work!\r\n\r\nI
    really admire the patience and the many skills font designers need to have.\r\nI
    was very confused by the yellow marks in FL ... Thanks again for your time and
    help! \r\n\r\nBarbara"

  body: "Hmm. When you talk about \"FontSquirrel,\" I suspect your making woff format
    fonts for the web?\r\n\r\nSpecial issues there, and I know almost nothing about
    those formats. For checking the  font itself, try using Microsoft Word (post 2010),
    or any OT-savvy text editor,  and a laser printer -- actually, I'd use  InDesign,
    but that's expecting a bit much, I know. \r\n\r\nIf everything works as it  should
    in print, press on to the web formats. I did find one tidbit about FontSquirrel
    & it's generator:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When using the FontSquirrel Webfont Generator,
    you need to check the radio button \u201CEXPERT\u201D and then select the languages
    to be supported or the code range. The default is that only characters used in
    \u201CWestern languages\u201D are included.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFor all I know,
    the Font Squirrel generator is not picking up that information from the font itself.
    Nor do I know what \"code page\" arrowright lived on, back in the dark ages when
    there were \"code pages\" for hard-wired encodings. But we're well outside the
    area where I know <cite>anything,</cite> so...\r\n"

  body: "Yes, i want to extend the web-font with arrows for not using ugly text-images.
    \r\n\r\nThe hint with the Expert-Mode was it. In this section i could put in the
    arrow-sign in a form for including Single Characters. Putting the Hex-Code in
    the Unicode Ranges-form doesn't work, but a simple copy of the symbol has done
    it. It makes of course sense that webfonts do not included all characters for
    being small.\r\n\r\nTomorrow i will print the font through Indesign for being
    sure that everything ist working correct.\r\nI am very grateful, thank you so
    much again :-)"
