body: I found this on an old fleamarket record. Looks and feels like an old Letraset
  font. Would anyone know what it is called, and if it exists in digital format anywhere?
  Thanks.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68339.gif" alt="Sample">

    name, but then that will be searching a needle in  <BR>the proverbial haystack.

  body: Thanks for that! I tried the whole www for Bullion Shadow, to no avail. Any
    idea who published Bullion Shadow in the first place, in whatever analogue format
    it came in? Was it Letraset? or Mecanorma? Or a different, similarly aesthetically
    adventurous enterprise? Any reference to a designer? A year of publication, anything?

  body: There was an Image Club font called Too Much Shadow &#40;see sample below&#41;
    that was like the round twin to Bullion Shadow. It appears that it wasn&#39;t
    one that Monotype kept in the Image Club collection when they took it over, so
    you&#39;d have to find one of the old Letterpress 5 or 6 CD&#39;s. Grant Hutchinson
    had some that he was willing to sell, but I don&#39;t know how much he wanted
    for them.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68490.gif" alt="Too
