body: "Hi, can someone help me please with this. I would like to use that kind of
  font in my project, but can't find out how to replicate the style.\r\n\r\nThe font/text
  I'm trying to use is found on the url - https://www.onnit.com/spirulina-chlorella/
  \r\n\r\nIt all the content text used on the onnit website.\r\n\r\nIf I copy this
  same text and paste it in my content, and than see the \"source\" code, it says
  <span style=\"color: rgb(61, 64, 66); font-family: proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue',
  Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.3636360168457px; line-height: 24px;\">\r\n\r\nBut
  when I put the same text under same style, it is different, - it also makes the
  paragraph seen of slightly another length.\r\n\r\nIt is different.\r\n\r\nPlease
  can anyone please help me out with this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\nBest
  regards\r\nSander"

    maybe you've considered the following already.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and basic
    of several possibilities is that you don't have access to the font that's specified
    in the code (Proxima Nova). If that's the case, what will display is the next
    available font that's listed, which seems to be Helvetica Neue, Helvetica and
    Arial in that order."
