    here </a> and scroll to the bottom. \r\n\r\nPantone Colors for the U.S. Flag\r\n\r\nThe
    U.S. Government Printing Office specifies Pantone 186 and 288 for the red and
    blue colors of the United States flag, but Pantone specifies Pantone 193 and 281.
    Other sources specify Pantone 282 for blue. This may be because inks look different
    on different paper stocks.\r\n"
