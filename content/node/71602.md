  1969 by Grolier. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/coldstyle/|Coldstyle]]
  looks very similar, but I'm looking for clean, un-weathered digitization (with italics
  would be great).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_4871.sample.3.jpg]"

  body: "Coldstyle is based on Old Style 1, which in turn inspired Bookman Old Style.
    Bookman's proportions are different than your sample, but Bookman Headline is
    closer.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I looked at both Bookman and Century Old Style, and the Q's were quite different.
    After flipping though the pages I found a sample with a capital Q which doesn't
    match either of those typefaces. WTF popped up Caslon SB for this sample, but
    that's a pretty poor match.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_6545.sample.5.jpg]"

  body: Your sample is an old Linotype face called Old Style No. 1. I don't think
    it has been digitized (other than Andrew Leman's distressed version). Century
    Old Style is similar in details, but heavier (as Nick mentioned). <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bruce-old-style/">Bruce
    Old Style</a> is closer in terms of weight and feel, but differs in the details.

  body: "Thanks everyone, I knew it was connected to Old Style No. 1 but I didn't
    realize it actually was it. Too bad it hasn't been digitized, it's a nice text
    font that reminds me of school textbooks from my childhood. I did some snooping
    and actually found it in an old  [[http://books.google.com/books?id=XxcPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false|Linotype
    Catalog]] in Google books.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    but atleast you'll have the font.
