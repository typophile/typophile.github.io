  can drag & drop them in a few seconds, but lets say I needed to perform this on
  approximately 2 kilofonts."

  body: "Hi Ray,\r\n\r\nYou will have to make your own encoding (or borrow one) with
    these 4 glyphs in the beginning. (there is a nice little software out there to
    edit the encoding file's numeration -take a look to an encoding file and you will
    understand what I mean)   \r\n\r\nHere is:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/46625\r\n\r\nYou
    can edit and rename an existing encoding and once it is placed in the encodings
    folder you'll be able to select it in the pull down menu (after re-starting FL).\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nR.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I might be mistaken (wouldn't be the first time), but I seem to remember that
    Fontographer USED to have an option to generate these glyphs automatically, although
    it appears that the latest release doesn't offer that option...
