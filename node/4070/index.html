  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Hey <BR> <BR>I am a designer living in Washington DC whose job is driving him insane.  I work for a giant engineering firm and people come to me with Powerpoint presentations they've tried to do themselves, and ask me to make a poster / brochure / display out of them. (Oh, the pain.) <BR> <BR>But YOU can help!  <BR> <BR>I am looking for advice about the best (for me) graduate programs in graphic design in the U.S. or Canada. I have an undergrad degree in Advertising, but it was more of a business-focused program. So I'm looking for a school that has a practical, professional orientation, as opposed to one that stresses theory / research. Basically, I'd like to take this degree and go work for a design firm. <BR> <BR>I have several years of design and production experience in in-house design departments at medium-sized companies, (as well as having done a bunch of freelance work) so I don't need to start from the beginning, with a Bachelor's design degree. <BR> <BR>I am leaning towards Pratt. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts / advice / resources?  Feel free to plug your alma mater or diss other schools &ndash; it's all good. <BR> <BR>You rock, <BR> <BR>&ndash;Troy</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">One problem you are going to find, is that most post-graduate degrees are theory driven. The practical comes about as a result of your theoretical research. <BR> <BR>Kind of generic, but you could try <A HREF="http://www.gradschools.com/listings/menus/design_graphic_menu.html" TARGET="_blank"> Gradschools.com</A> <BR> <BR>Schools: <BR> <BR>Yale <BR>SVU <BR>Virginia Commonwealth <BR>IIT <BR>MIT <BR>RISD <BR>Cranbrook <BR>Academy of Art <BR> <BR> <BR>So many choices. I'm interested in the PhD end of this question. What about the rest of you. I'd love to hear about schools based on their experience at the schools.  <BR> <BR>Troy, my personal (and biased) choice would be Reading, but that isn't in Canada or the U.S.</div>

I was instructed to fire the last one; she was a grad but didn't know how to use any of the layout programs (&quot;Our instructors didn't focus on that,&quot; she said) and set an entire project in screen fonts, false bolds, false italics and didn't know why they defaulted when printed. <BR> <BR>Out of the four or five grads that passed thru our shop, none had strong conceptual skills, most had difficulty working under deadline and none could work without continual direction. <BR> <BR>In fact, my CD demanded that our  recruitment <BR>ads state &quot;understanding of spatial relations a must.&quot; When asked, one candidate and AI grad said  &quot;yeah, I get along well with everybody.&quot; <BR> <BR>They all had beautiful, beautiful books however. <BR> <BR>I know somebody who went to RISD and would've killed to have been able to afford him.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Tracy, <BR> <BR>I don't blame you at all. There is a large contingency of AI grads that do only as much to finish the program instead of taking it seriously and relating it to future career aspirations. I only felt professionally challenged by about 5% of my classmates and took school very seriously. <BR> <BR>This perhaps is a good time to get back to Troy's original post and suggest that if you're going to take this effort seriously and make the most of a career in art and design, commit yourself to learning as much as you can, have an open mind, and take it seriously. <BR> <BR>I can't express enough in today's economy after all the agencies and design firms had mass layoffs how many designers are out there looking to be hired. Many of them just aren't that hireable (see Tracy's post above) and the older set isn't retiring anytime soon. That is why you must take school seriously and befriend designers and teachers to learn all they can teach you about how it REALLY is, ask questions - you'll get answers! <BR> <BR>I do have one warning for you though . . . The more you learn about design, the less likely you will be fixing Powerpoint files two years from now, and once you do learn design, it's very hard to revert back to seeing things without a critical eye. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If I read this right, I think Troy is asking for <BR>a 'portfolio school' as opposed to a 'theory <BR>school.' The former focuses on graduating <BR>kids  with a solid body of work, as opposed to <BR>just good thinking. In my opinion, the 'portfolio' <BR>schools that effectively teach theory have the <BR>edge because they teach execution. <BR>Execution is 50 percent of good design.  <BR> <BR>Then again, Sagmeister and Carson have <BR>made healthy careers off of great ideas with <BR>mediocre execution. <BR> <BR>Re: Powerpoint.

		<div class="commentbody">hehheh! Death to PowerPoint! <BR>Thanks for not taking offense! <BR>Not to sidetrack from the original post again but , my conscience is pricking me &hellip; to be perfectly fair, my experience with AI grads was two years ago and, shortly before our agency's demise, the school did contact us about how hires were working out and what we thought their program's strengths and weaknesses were. They did seem genuinely concerned about shortcomings. <BR> <BR>I think some of the best learning of all comes from getting to sit next to wonderful designers. Spending hours observing as a piece goes from concept thru production, is utterly priceless. <BR> <BR>what are the differences anyway? Do roles and functions vary from firm to firm? perhaps it would help to know what the differences are, art director, designer? production artist? <BR> <BR>The bitch I've seen in today's economy is that many employers want somebody who can do it all, not just have great ideas and be able to articulate them to staff but more importantly execute them better than just that 50% I know it's cost me several jobs&hellip; admitting that I'm a concept person not a production person. I've heard being an idea person but will always get you hired but have yet to experience it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If your thinking of Canada - George Brown in Toronto has a good program linked with Concordia U. and resources up the yahoo, support from DX (Design Exchange) and RGD/GDC. I was very jealous of George Brown's program when I graduated. They do have a thesis/portfolio year - 4th that you could prolly jump right into. The courses look yummy. I plan to go back and take it during the evenings just for fun.  <BR> <BR>I went to Algonquin in Ottawa - same feeling as Stuart's- not many taking it seriously and unfortunately there's only a few good profs. There is a fast-track program though run by Janet Menger. 6 months. $6000 I think. She can make you think and teach you what you need. The 3 year program useto be top-rated here - but I donno&hellip;I had to do alot of my own research for various feilds of interest the profs had no idea about (and now they ask that I go back and talk to students, I really don't know THAT much, so I'd be worried about their cirriculum) strangely enough very few assignment pieces out of the 3 years made it into my portfolio. <BR> <BR>Other then that - there's OCAD, in TO or the maritimes. But that's mainly theory.</div>

If you are considering Canada - make sure you contact the Registered Graphic Designer's Association in that province to make sure the school is recognized, and/or you can ask them which institution will be best for you. You can consult <a href="http://www.gdc.net">www.gdc.net</a> (The Society of&hellip;) <BR> <BR>The Associations and Society grant the Accrediations up here - you'll have to take an exam with the board after your program. Canada's Designers are somewhat like Lawyers - half the time you have to be RGD to be hired, or use RFP lists. So once your in your also covered under NAFTA to swing into the States.</div>
