  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThere are some retailers out there. They will propably not
    purchase your designs but take it under contract. That means that they might wanna
    sell it exclusively for you for a limited periode of time. Depending on what you
    have to offer and if they like it, you might get a contract. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/\">MyFonts</a>
    works non-exclusive and you can get your fonts out there as you please. They take
    only 35% fee, so you get to keep 65%! For as far as I know it this is the best
    deal out there.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of my fonts at differtent retailers, but found
    it very hard to get in contact with them. So prepare yourself for hard work and
    disappointment. ;-)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n*** www.characters.nl

  body: "Hi. I held off replying, because it's tough to know what to say. Most publishers
    - myself included - like to work with designers to get their types ready for the
    world, and then do the marketing and whatnot, and hope that the marketplace wll
    respond. Type publishing is a huge gamble and the rewards range from zero to pretty
    good. Publishers share the risk and the reward with designers. Buyouts of type
    designs do happen, but usually it's designers/publishers selling to a client.
    You might find a publisher who will be interested in a buyout of your designs,
    but most will want to maintain a publisher/author relationship. That being said,
    you should definitely contact those foundries whose work you admire, and who you
    feel would admire your work. Then you can discuss the nitty-gritty business details.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I don''t think there will be too many vendors out there who will pay upfront
    cash to someone that doesn''t have a track-record of producing a string of top-sellers,
    even then I''d guess it would only be a small advance on royalties. Maybe having
    your own site or a myfonts store would be a good first step. If your plan is to
    maximize revenue then building a reputation (making good stuff, attending & speaking
    at the conferences, getting high-profile clients, entering a few compos, doing
    more techy work - such as clever OTL or hinting) and then doing custom work might
    be your best plan.     '

    their record label, because their recordings are guaranteed to sell well, and
    their creative track record is very good. An unknown band whose songs have never
    been heard; they'll probably need to play a few bar gigs before they reach U2
    status..."

    are both respected publishers who have a track record of regularly releasing original
    new designs.\r\nThey will not purchase your designs outright. However, they will
    assist in production, and then they will release and market the fonts. "

  body: "While it does take a small piece of time and thought to get the fonts ready
    for sale on Myfonts, there really is no ongoing promotion/marketing required from
    you. Myfonts already has the traffic flow in place to showcase your font to a
    greater capacity than you would ever be able to do yourself.\r\nIn regard to waiting
    for payment, well, as others have said, you really can not expect up front payments
    without a track record, and I personally dont see any hardship in the 30+ days
    waiting period for royalties to be forwarded to you."

    what extra do,Who has a track record?.Something from out of tec. spec.!!!!!What
    the different they do.</strong>\r\nIf i am running a type foundary,i will look
    for technically ok,well hinted,well kerned,features working well,and above all
    design has something appealing,which can attract to buyers.They don't look who
    is designer.A wellknown or unknown both can create good designs.There maybe one
    difference due to lack of experience\"technical\".\r\n"

    you've been given a lot of good, sound advice. One question, where are your fonts?
    if you were to show examples of your stuff people may be able to give you more

  body: "I think that what Si means is that a constructed typeface as you have shown
    is the kind of exercise which all young type designers create as technical trials;
    one can build something on a grid quite quickly, and play out some technical ideas.
    But more typographic designs - such as \"Gotham\" or \"Farnham\", to pick two
    recent typefaces at random - really demonstrate the skills their designers have,
    as well as their \xE6sthetic sense."

  body: "I agree with Chester, the choice was poor because...\r\n\r\na. A constructed
    font doesn't really demonstrate any of the typical type design skills. It does
    look like a typical beginner's effort. Nothing wrong with that, but if this is
    typical of what you're currently producing then you have a ways to go before you
    can expect any kind of commercial success.  \r\n\r\nb. It shows a lack of understanding
    of what outfits like Adobe (the subject of your initial inquiry) are interested
    in - compare with Bickham Script Pro, or Garamond Premier Pro. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si\r\n"
