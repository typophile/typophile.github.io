  body: Fabienne <BR> <BR>I have been told that M&amp;H Type in the Presideo are still
    open to visits from enthusiastic type people. They are a hot metal foundry, and
    have a long history and a great holding of foundry equipment. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: 'A couple of great bookstores: Builders Book Source, and William Stout. The
    former has the distinct advantage of being in Ghirardelli Square, while the latter
    has two branches, only one of which &#40;I forget which&#41; will actually serve
    the typographer well. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Stout Books is an amazing place all of the type stuff is downstairs.  They
    actually closed the South Park store, Hrant &#40;it was the smaller one with fewer
    type books&#41;. The other store is in North Beach, about a block from the <a
    href="http://www.tapyramid.com/">Transamerica Pyramid</a>. There&#39;s more info
    on Stout&#39;s <a href="http://www.stoutbooks.com">website</a>. <BR> <BR>If you
    are looking for just interesting neighborhoods with lots of type there&#39;s always
    some great stuff on the streets in the Mission district. Haight Ashbury is pretty
    good as well.

  body: M&amp;H Type is owned by Arion Press <a href="http://www.arionpress.com" target="_blank">http://www.arionpress.com</a>
    and they only give tours on Thursday. Best to call ahead. You should also check
    out Green Apple Books <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com" target="_blank">http://www.greenapplebooks.com</a>.
    Arguably the best bookstore in the City. If you can make it to Berkely, then you
    should check out Seredipity Books <a href="http://www.serendipitybooks.com" target="_blank">http://www.serendipitybooks.com</a>
    by some accounts the best bookstore in the nation. Very knowledgeable about type.
    Enjoy your visit!

  body: Serendipty Books in Berkeley is very good and worth a visit, but mainly for
    literature. I didn&#39;t find much type stuff there on my last visit a couple
    of years ago. Also worth visiting in Berkeley is <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/brs/books/moes.html">Moe&#39;s
    Books</a>.

  body: 'While the printing and type section isn&#39;t huge at Seredipity, it&#39;s
    a great place to go to talk about type. The owner will give you a dissertation
    if you allow him.  <BR> <BR>Wm. Stout for hard to find type books. &#40;Watch
    for meter sharks!&#41; <BR>Moe&#39;s for almost impossible to find type books. '
