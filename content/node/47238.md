  body: "It's not kerning, it's rounding. Although Tahoma is designed with a pixel
    grid in mind, there is no way all spacing can be taken into account for all pixel
    sizes.\r\n\r\nAlthough I must add that your screen shot is especially bad looking
    ... On my machine, even a size of 7 points displays nicer text. Mind, that's an
    1280x1024 TTF screen with ClearType on. It sure helps with the small sizes.\r\n\r\nSee
    these fountains -- 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 pts. Note the difference in <em>length</em>
    between 9 and 10 points -- also due to rounding, but this time it appears to preserve
    character form instead of character width (courtesy of Microsoft, I guess).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tahoma_3912.PNG]\r\n\r\nAny
    special reason your measurements are in pixels, rather than points? What program
    did you use?\r\n\r\n[Edit:] Oh, CS3. Well, it's still a lousy display. Do you
    have the highest possible setting for text in your preferences? (I.e., anything
    better than \"lowest\"?)"

  body: "\" Although Tahoma is designed with a pixel grid in mind, there is no way
    all spacing can be taken into account for all pixel sizes.\"\r\n\r\nActually,
    it was, at least for these sizes. But that was done for the Win rasterizer. IN
    CS3, unless I'm mistaken you're using the Adobe rasterizer, and I'm not sure what
    it's doing to get quality, whether it's doing some sort of oversampling as the
    Mac rasterizer, or something else all together. \r\n\r\nAs Theunis noted, it's
    not a kerning issue. This would be a really small size to show large kerning values.
    However it's also not a simple rounding issue either. In the 11pix sample it looks
    like that, but note that in the 13 pix sample, you're not only seeing strokes
    crash, but overlap. see the word \"in\", where the \"i\" and left stroke of the
    \"n\" actually overlap. Normal rounding issues wouldn't explain that. This is
    some miscalculation of the advance widths, is my guess.\r\n\r\nHmm, although aside
    form describing the issue, I can't help more, as I don't have a Mac with CS right
    now. Perhaps the other Adobe experts will fill in the gaps? \r\n\r\nJason c\r\n"

  body: "On a slightly different note, \"CS3\" is not a program. Is this Illustrator,
    Photoshop (as Si and Jason assume), InDesign (as I was thinking)?\r\n\r\nI <em>do</em>
    get this ugly small text in InDesign (CS1), <strong>if and only if</strong> I
    set the text real small -- 7 pts, on a medium sized page -- A5, zoomed out to
    show the entire page, and <em>then only</em> if I force InDesign's display performance
    to really really low: \"Optimized\", which turns off anti-aliasing on the screen.\r\n\r\nThat
    \"screen anti-aliasing\" is another important point. If this is text from Illustrator
    or InDesign, you don't have to worry about the screen quality. If you print it,
    it will look great. (Oh, okay, only if your printer has a reasonable quality as
    well!) If you zoom in onto it, it will not look great (because you will still
    see aliasing), but at least the characters will separate. And if you set the view
    quality to better than the worst possible, it'll look much better, even in small
    sizes.\r\n\r\nIf this is text in Photoshop, you have a totally different set of
    problems. If this is meant to be printed at, say, a reasonably 200 dpi (and \"print
    quality\" images should at least be 300 dpi), your tiny 9 pixel text will be about
    0.045 inch tall, or in the metric system, about 1 millimeter.\r\nIf it's intended
    for the screen (as in: a web page), try selecting one of the other rendering modes
    for text. Photoshop allows a number of quality settings, and again you seem to
    have chosen the worst one possible.\r\n\r\n(What Jason is suggesting is also possible:
    Photoshop needs a few more colours to be able to draw the text antialiased.)"

    something different to you. If it is not, in fact, the difference between the

    certainly integer spacing according to the bitmap or hints, how do you think things

  body: "Well, the OP mentions \"it was fixed for a while, but now its doing it again\",
    which suggests <em>something else</em> than mere local software settings.\r\n\r\nThe
    difference between Single Line and Multi-Line Composer is that the former fills
    a line of text, adjusts for space settings, looks for possible hyphenation to
    the previous line(s) (to count the number of successive hyphens), then moves on
    to the next.\r\nThe Multi-Line Composer does the same, but also takes into account
    the <em>average space width</em> in each separate line. It then averages the space
    widths over the entire paragraph, rather than taking them for granted. To appreciate
    the difference, compare InDesign's formatting to that of WordPerfect, PageMaker,
    Quark, and Word. ID's text spacing is by far more consistent.\r\n\r\n\"Non-integer
    or integer\" could apply to the internal calculations of character and space widths,
    but I'd expect (and certainly hope!) calculations are done with as high as possible
    precision. Referring back to Word: it appears to me it bases its spacing and character
    positioning on the resolution of the printer, which means documents will re-flow
    if you change to another (and hey, so it does). InDesign does not have that flaw.\r\n\r\nBe
    it kerning, rounding, or integer-based maths, the OP has had this problem on and
    off for presumably the same InDesign/Photoshop settings, the same OS, and the
    same font file."

    to printing, so I don't think you are remotely relating to the precision of the
    post. \r\n\r\nIf the Single Line Composer is other than simply planting each bitmap
    glyph end to end on integer metrics, until it runs out of full words and starts
    a new line \u2014  I'd be surprised (from what I see), wouldn't you?\r\n\r\nCheers!"
