body: I've got an [unusually dark] blue highlighter and a red ballpoint pen here at
  work. I use the highlighter like a broad-nib pen. The pen I use for making outlines
  and filling them. The project I keep kicking around in the back of my head is a
  can label for Sea Meat, a curious fictional aquatic meat food.

  body: Sea Meat. Isn't that what surimi is? The seafood that is flavored to  approximate
    crab and any number of other sea meat?
