body: "Im having problems with suitcase X1 (11.0.2). \r\n\r\nWith some fonts when
  I add them (by dragging) they remain in their suitcase but others seperate and leave
  me with 5 fonts rather than one suitcase with 5 variations. Its getting complicated
  because I have variations of the same font. Rather than having JansonMT, I have
  jansonMTbold, JansonMTitalic and so on, is there a way of selecting them and putting
  them all in the one JansoMT folder? or is this a glitch in suitcase.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help."
