  (ie. James Gandolfini) in The Sopranos opening credits! I have searched as much
  as I could, but I just keep coming across the \u2018Mobsters\u2019 font.\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for your cooperation."

    match here is one that is almost there:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ExcaliburMonospace_5368.jpg]\r\nIts
    called Excalibur Monospace. Freely available on the web. No download link because
    I have no idea as to the legitimacy of this font.\r\nFonts with some similarity,
    but not as close: Consolas, Tahoma, Trebuchet & Verdana, all packaged with Microsoft
    Windows.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Ryuk for digging out the exact match.\r\nNow that I look at it, and
    checking the font notes by Adobe, I do recall this awkward and rather ugly creation
    from the days when the secretaries used the IBM Selectric typewriter. I tried
    to avoid having it used whenever possible. Thankfully I did not have a lot of
    tables typed out.\r\nBut this creature is perfect for the Sopranos opening. Its
    crude text fits the sordid landscape through which Tony drives on the way to his
    mansion and the harsh antisocial background music.\r\nDon"
