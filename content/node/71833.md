  body: "Even though the A appears to be stencil-ized, none of the other letters do,
    including the O which doesn't make sense for a stencil. The letters have a crude,
    almost hand-made quality to them (notice the side strokes of the O are uneven
    widths), so I suspect a 'grungified' freebie may have been used, but for a clean
    commercial font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed/\">Heroic
    Condensed</a> gets close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
