body: Anyone know if there was ever an official version of City released with a Stencil
  variant? I seem to remember seeing a few examples here and there (this is a title
  card from a BBC tv series from the 1970s), but I've never seen a digital edition
  of it. Easy enough to hack together in Illustrator, but if an actual typeface exists
  that'd be better.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/300px-Playfortodaytitles_3439.JPG]

  body: "There once existed a typeface family from URW \r\nwith a stencilized version
    of City Medium.  \r\n\r\nI searched and searched and can't find it.  \r\n\r\nI
    own a Mac Postscript version of that typeface. \r\nThe breaks may be in spots
    different from your \r\ntitle card example.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if you would
    like me to send you \r\nwhat I have.  I'll check back in a few days."
