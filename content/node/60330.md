body: "We've released several new fonts in the past couple of months, so I thought
  I'd issue an update.\r\n\r\nThe most recent releases at <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com\">The
  Scriptorium</a> include Rasael (a lovely script), Rockne (a somewhat psychedelic
  design), Agravain (a lovely pen hand font) and tomorrow we're releasing Red Star
  which is based on Soviet era poster lettering.\r\n\r\nA little bit of everything.
  \ Come check out the new fonts and the updated site design at <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com\">fontcraft.com</a>.\r\n\r\nDave"
