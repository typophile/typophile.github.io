  goes to curriculum or not? I read Allan Haley article where he says that it doesn\u2019t
  have to be taught because most of them is just a combination between common sense,
  attention to detail and visual acuity. At school, we learn about rules and guidelines.
  Where, actually it\u2019s all about common senses. Can reader read it properly without
  read a same line twice and is it easy to read?  So what we really need to be taught
  at school? "

  body: "Unfortunately common sense can be rather subjective. Rules and guidelines
    provide an objective framework that can then be adhered to or disregarded when
    appropriate.\r\n\r\n'Common sense' can be also be taken for granted by those who
    are already familiar with those rules and guidelines, which might lead to some
    people being dismissive of teaching the basics. I would suggest that the teaching
    of some basic principles of typography would lead to qualities such as attention
    to detail and visual acuity, and ultimately an ingrained common sense."

    to build their 'common sense' on.

  body: "Reddy, \r\n\r\nEveryone who can read uses type, all day long, every day.
    It doesn't require special training. But designers arrange the type, design books,
    signs, magazines, packages, and if they do it badly, everyone has to suffer. So
    the designer needs to know more than the \"man on the street\". \r\n\r\nIt's not
    just a stuffy old expression: Learn the rules so you can break them well. More
    specifically, learn how type works, so you can do things with it that are effective
    and useful, and answer the need to communicate. How does a designer learn about
    contrast, spacing, size, hierarchy. etc. without at least some basic instruction?
    Evidence is everywhere that they don't. I don't believe it's all \"common sense\".
    \r\n\r\nReddy, look online for an article by Jan Conradi about Slow Typography.
    She is an advocate of improving typographic education in general design programs. "

    It appeared in the latest Interrobang, which was handed out at TypeCon, though
    I realize everyone couldn't attend. I'll look into ways I could post or share
    it. Maybe Jan will e-mail it. Stay tuned. "

  body: "Learning typography is far more than \"The Rules\" of typography.  Rules
    come about because of past problems.  We cannot assume that we can create rules
    to encompass all possibilities or eliminate future problems.  We have to learn
    to \"see\" typographically.  Rules for book design apply differently to ads and
    covers.  There is no sure passage to good typography.  Like anything else, it
    takes work.  Part of the work is getting a good sound basis in design school.
    \ The rest comes from a combination of job experience and interaction with colleagues
    in the profession.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    quote as an apostrophe plainly shows that we can''t rely on "common sense." the
    finer points must be taught, and the beauty of typography is in the finer points.'
