body: "Hello -\r\n\r\n<strong>Context</strong>:\r\nAs a packaging designer, my clients
  are often requesting that we add Arabic, Chinese and Hebrew texts on packaging.\r\nMore
  often than not, I receive 4 different types of text sources :\r\n\r\n \u2014  1.
  \r\nA .PDF containing a scan of the text needed (so nothing more than a picture).\r\n\r\n
  \u2014  2.\r\nA .PDF whereby I can select the text and copy it into MS Word\xAE
  but the sentence is no longer the same as what I had copied from the .PDF file!
  (e.g. some of the characters are replaced by strange ones).\r\n\r\n \u2014  3.\r\nA
  .PDF file where the client has inserted an annotation which displays correctly in
  the Acrobat\xAE but the moment that I do a copy/paste into MS Word\xAE, the whole
  sentence is inversed (text appearing left to right instead of right to left -> For
  Arabic).\r\n\r\n \u2014  4.\r\nSometimes I also receive Excel\xAE files.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter
  copying the text into MS Word\xAE, I save the file in .PDF format and I then re-open
  it in Adobe Illustrator\xAE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Softwares</strong>:\r\n\t\u2022\_Adobe\xAE
  CS5 (Illustrator,...)\r\n\t\u2022\_MS Office\xAE 2011\r\n\t\u2022\_Mac OS 10.6.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Question</strong>:\r\nIs
  there an easier, faster and more reliable method to extract such \"exotic\" text?\r\ne.g.
  a plug-in, another software, another method (instead of having to pass through MS
  Word\xAE, ...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your precious help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-
  Dimitri\r\n"

    InDesign mentioned in your post anywhere, but I would guess that if you're designing
    packaging, your art eventually ends up in InDesign, right? If you used one of
    these versions, ideally \u2014 I can't promise this \u2014 you should be able
    to copy the text from a PDF and paste it correctly without needing to go through
    Word, Illustrator, or anything else.\r\n\r\nI haven't done this myself, though,
    so someone correct me if I'm wrong."

  body: "One of your problems is probably that MS Word for Mac has never supported
    Arabic/Hebrew, so you should definitely avoid that.  OpenOffice will normally
    work better. But I would agree with Joshua you should try the ME version of Adobe
    CS.\r\n\r\nPDF format is also unfortunately not reliable for copy/paste of non-Latin
    scripts because sometimes the way it gets created results in garbage internal
    coding."

  body: "Hello - \r\n\r\nThanks for your replies...\r\nIn fact, we only use Adobe
    Illustrator and Photshop to make packaging. Our agency only use InDesign for \"editon\"
    jobs (books, ad, annual report, ...).\r\n\r\nI'll try with Libre Office or something
    similar.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Dimitri     www.thebend.be\r\n"
