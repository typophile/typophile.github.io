  a link in said bio and decided to investigate. Well, lo and behold, it was a typeface
  dedicated to script faces. I forgot to email the link to myself so I could view
  it in greater detail. However, I can not for the life of me remember the thread
  where I first saw the posting.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was a former Electrical Engineer
  (retired, I think) turned type designer, from Washington state and worked for an
  aircraft company, I'm assuming Boeing. Anyway, does this profile sound and/or website
  sound familiar to anyone?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for any assistance you may
  render."
