  some more weights. <BR>Please feel free to help me to finish the work. <BR>I know
  that some forms &#40;Hrant pointed me&#41; are more humanistics than the others

  body: Ale - You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not unicase. What it looks like to me  <BR>is
    a lowercase and small caps. Add an uppercase a bit larger  <BR>than the small
    caps and you have 2 full fonts. ;&#41;

  body: Uh, is are the curves unsmooth or is that just my flash plugin? <BR>I find
    it very good, Alejandro. It just needs to be fine-tuned in the details, as far
    as I&#39;m concerned. The mix of influences is well balanced and it gives a very
    lively appearance. I&#39;d balance the lowercase s and add lowercase numerals,
    then re-check all the metrics, that&#39;s what comes to my mind, but in general
    it seems to work very good.
