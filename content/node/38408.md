  \"I think of a letter and then I draw a line around it.\" I told that to my 4 1/2
  year-old the other night at the table, and now she's drawing really nice outlines
  of uppercase A's.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me how much I like to draw letters...and always
  have. Can anyone direct me to some web sites featuring \"hand lettering service
  for the graphic arts\" so that I can begin formulating a plan to give them some
  competition?\r\n\r\nRelatedly, I am saddened to see so many posts asking, \"What
  font is this?\" As if all anybody does is \"choose a font\" anymore. I think it
  sucks that we don't see nearly as much hand lettering in advertising and in logos,
  etc. as we used to (open any magazine from 1950). The current and future generations
  are already brainwashed to believe that the best letters are created by choosing
  a font on their computer. I used to teach jr. high English...the kids' penmanship,
  most of it, was terrible. The consensus was, \"Why should I know how to write cursive
  when the computer makes letters so much better than I can?\"\r\n\r\nWhat font is
  \"Coca-Cola\"?\r\n\r\nPlease cheer me up with examples of hand lettering in the
  modern world of graphic art. I want to be proven wrong.\r\n"

  body: "<em>The growing flexibility of type in the post-metal world (phototype and
    digital type) is what killed hand lettering</em>\r\n\r\nRight. The phototypositor
    simplified art direction and empowered art directors by giving them a system for
    specifying headlines which produced inexpensive results within predictable horizons
    of expectation, but with enough complexity to enrich the product. As an AD, I
    worked with lettering artists occasionally, and it could be fantastic, but it
    was always expensive, and you never knew quite what you'd be getting, so headlines
    set by a type-house was the advertising agency norm. \r\n\r\nAn AD could do a
    rough comp (comprehensive layout), and everyone involved -- creative director,
    account executive, client, photographer, type house -- knew how the end result
    should turn out. At the same time, there was room to exercise typographic nuance,
    by spec'ing type style, size, letterspacing and leading precisely, even horizontal
    scaling.\r\n\r\nI worked like that during the late 1970s through the '80s. For
    some reason, I only kept one example of my work which shows the process, and as
    fate would have it, the typeface is Helvetica.\r\n\r\nThis ad from the early '80s
    was 15-20 years after the demise of widespread hand-lettering of headlines, and
    represented a regime that lasted, say, from around 1960 to around 1990. \r\n\r\nI
    wonder if my perspective is typical. Anybody?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Perma-LocA_4331.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Perma-LocB_3477.jpg]"

  body: "Yeah, I had the same experience. I hated doing marker comp layouts. I had
    to lay out a whole catalog that way once. Page after page of sketching photos
    and greeked type blocks with markers. I still have a set of AD markers I used
    to use for comp layouts. Some of them still work. \r\n\r\nWhen I started out,
    I sometimes put type specimen sheets into a Lucy (a kind of overhead opaque projector
    that could reduce and enlarge things) in order to accurately trace letters onto
    a layout. Somebody I knew worked at a place were they let them use Letraset type
    and dummy text in their comps. Then they would send that to the typesetter to
    match. I was astounded (it was expensive) and jealous.\r\n\r\nAround 1980, I worked
    at a magazine where we had access to a photocopy machine that could enlarge and
    reduce. That changed everything (until desktop publishing)."

    will go the hand lettering route these days because it's too expensive and too
    unpredictable, and any impact to be gained through the unique, human element of
    hand drawn lettering is just not enough to make it a regular consideration. Reasonable
    enough, but a bit of a bummer. I'm only 38 and I can't see sitting in front of
    this computer for the next 25 years. I DO miss ink and x-acto blades (though I've
    never been a fan of white-out...it only takes away the flaws of being human that
    I crave).\r\n\r\nIf not hand lettered headers, then at least, and back to my main
    point, I hope to some day see more hand lettered logos (and I'd love to be drawing
    some of them).\r\n\r\nPlease keep the links and samples coming!\r\n "

  body: "<em>...few ADs will go the hand lettering route these days because...</em>\r\n\r\n...because
    it wouldn't mean anything.\r\n99 times out of 100 when typographers use a \"hand-written\"
    script, it's typeset, and there is often the illogical occurence of two rough-looking
    letters side by side that are identical. But nobody notices the absurdity, within
    the ecosystem of designer--supplier--client--consumer. Such critical awareness
    and appraisal has generally vanished from the culture of commercial production,
    where I suggest it evolved related closely to the practice of \"comping\" with
    rough sketches, which required a keen eye for the relationship between sketched
    and finished art, from those involved in the production process, whether client
    or supplier. Now concept artwork looks as slick as finished art (as Mark notes,
    the photocopier made its contribution). \r\n\r\n<em>unique, human element of hand
    drawn lettering</em>\r\n\r\nIs that really the issue? You may be refering to \"natural\"
    media, as opposed to digital media.\r\nNatural media, and the quality of capturing
    a critical live performance with pen/brush and ink, with its extemporization,
    idiosyncracies and accidents. But even there, few of those pieces are left in
    their raw state. It's not a black/white distinction, as drawing and vector-adjusting
    handwork are an integral part of digital glyph-making in almost all fonts. It
    wasn't always that way -- once, letters were mainly written or punchcut. Drawing,
    i.e. taking a line from point A to point B, is an integral part of digital letter-making.\r\n\r\nIt
    matters little now whether a piece of what looks like hand lettering is:\r\n1)
    natural media scanned and bitmapped\r\n2) natural media scanned, (auto-) traced
    to vectors and modified\r\n3) original digital artwork drawn in Photoshop\r\n4)
    original vector artwork drawn in Illustrator\r\n5) combination of above\r\n6)
    digital artwork made from plain \"script\" fonts with vector-drawn glyphs, not
    outlined\r\n7) digital artwork made from OpenType \"script\" fonts with vector-drawn
    glyphs, and contextual alternates\r\n8) vector artwork built on 7 or 8, then modified
    by further drawing in Illustrator/Photoshop\r\n\r\nProfessional lettering artists,
    not to mention type designers, use many of these techniques--mixed media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    - the people that hire for hand lettering learned in an era where you select the
    typeface from the list on your computer.  Signs have gone vinyl for convenience
    and cost.  Ads and other publishing have gone digital.  Finding someone to do
    competent hand lettering got difficult years ago, and people stopped looking.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few cases where new fonts are designed, and new designers are earning reputations,
    but for the most part the world changed.  The craftsmen are competing with MS
    Word and The Font Thing - and the amateurs and young designers don't understand
    the difference.  \r\n\r\nI think the issue is less the actual difference in cost
    or convenience, than AD's being unfamiliar with when hand lettering is appropriate
    or even available.  \"The tool defines the task\" sort of thing, once a publisher
    gets out of the habit of hand lettering."
