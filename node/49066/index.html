<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello to all you esteemed experts out there,
I need some practical help with finishing my logo for an independent travel operator for the British market specialising in the travel to the authentic middle-east like Jordan, Syria and Oman among others.
As a new start-up and completely inexperienced in commissioning these things, I had the logo designed last year way before I had even a vague idea about how it would be used. Consequently, aside from a slight change to the shape of the dome and colours of the logo, I signed off on something that looked good but suffered on legibility when I began to 'road test' it.
I've attached the original, and also where I am right now with it, key changes are:
1. Removed the reflected line as that was doing anything but enhance name recognition!
2. Change the Uppercase B in Bedouin.travel to a lowercase b so that it read more like the web address (bedouin.travel)it was meant to.
The company is not far off commencing trading and I need to get on with nailing the logo and print letterhead, compliment slips and business cards (for starters!) in a way that where its appearance is consistent across all three.
I have a few questions to the logo in its current form:
1. Given that my websites are going to be bedouin.travel, bedouintravel.me, bedouintravel.hu and finally bedouin.aero, I'm wondering whether the dome ligature might work equally, if not better, on the u and n of the word bedouin.
2. Can't quite get the right colour for the logo, was thinking a bright vibrant orange as reminiscent of the heat of the desert rather than a washed out yellow of desert sand. If you can show a colour with pantone that you think works better< I'd appreciate it.
OR
3. Does someone have an idea, even a sketch, that blows the current logo away?
Even though funds as a yet to launch start-up are limited, I'm willing to pay something if need be for any suggested major redesign or amendment that I wish to pursue, wouldn't want anyone to think I'm putting this out there to save money, it's more for the increased scrutiny/eye for design/refinement of the typophile community that I just couldn't find ANYWHERE else.
Many thanks for your assistance

<div class=commentbody>The original logo has not uploaded well, never mind, it was only to show that the b was formerly a B and that there used to be a reflection.
The last sentence was supposed to convey the fact that I am not even aware of many of the criteria with which I need to be able to critique my company logo. (Its nearly 3am here in London and my mind is getting mangled enough not to be able to express myself more clearly!)

<div class=commentbody>1. I would agree with your idea that the ligature should be placed over the "u" and "n". That's the unique word (travel isn't) and it's the one that's consistent throughout your site iterations.
2. As for color, are you intending to use this orange on black? if not, upload it on different background colors such as paper or an alternate color you'd like to use for your identity. That way we get a better feel for how well the main orange color will work across a variety of placements.

<div class=commentbody>well, when I first saw your logo I had no idea what that curvy thing on the "r" and "a" of travel was and why it was there. Is it the top of a mosque? Regardless of what it is, I don't think it fits there. It could easily be mistaken for a leaf or a wishbone.
I don't think the period delimiter makes it look more like a website than "bedouin travel". In fact, take that period and place it above the "i" -- or just get rid of it. Right now it looks like you're trying to be "l337" like uber.pwnage or h0t.d0gs
your "b" has a straight cutoff on the bottom left corner, however, your "d" does not.
it sounds like you're on a tight deadline. Try to find a muslim influenced script in place of your serif font. That way there's no need for motifs if you already establish the muslim or middle eastern feel you're going for. If that sounds too cliché then go get a nice serif font and try making some of the changes above. I think it will lessen some confusion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dear Penn and MrK,
Thanks for your comments, Penn - your first point is what I too was thinking as I have no Graphic Design skills I will perhaps wait and see if someone comes up withsomething better before getting a designer to try it so I can have a look see. As for the background colour, I guess it needs to work with White firstly, and then if possible, with Black too, the text colour though has to be something evocative of the desert.
MrK, I don't want to make the dome any more overt as a great many of my customers will not be muslim and I don't want them to necessarily feel excluded. Interestingly those that have been coming to the business with an islamic eye have tended to spot it quicker than those not looking at it from that angle.
Am open to moving the period around but I did quite like the idea of keeping it all as a web address though I didn't understand the '1337' comment. As for the bottom of the b, I can see why you thought that, I though it too and it was the first thing that I pointed out in the amendment though surprisingly it didn't look as good somehow.
Thanks for taking the time so far...

<div class=commentbody>Right, have had a bit of a think on this one and I seem to be losing myself in options:
could chnage the dome ligature by:
1. moving it onto the right stem of the u and the left stem of the n (hopefully without the n getting confused with an h)
2. moving it to above the i
3. replacing the o with a dome
4. leaving it where it is
then I guess I could see whether logo reflection can remain by:
1. making it 5-15% grey on a white background and 35-50% lighter than when on a black background
2. making the outline a 'ghost' one
3. giving up and doing away with it together
paralysis by analysis I fear!
