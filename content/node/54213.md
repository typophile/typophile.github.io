  body: "To begin with, you have some beautiful work there! \r\n\r\nThe simplicity
    appeals to me, but I wonder if the navigation could use more hierarchy or visual
    spacing\u2026name, contact info, and work all seem to run together.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    it works well as a showcase of your work. I see quite a bit of elegant playfulness
    in your work, which makes me want to see a bit of that in the branding of your
    site as well."

    a concession to convention, and bearing in mind that potential customers might
    not be as sensitive or artistic as you are, perhaps a bit less white space ...
    If you had a nice logo, almost like a chop stamp on a Chinese watercolour in the
    top corner, it would not detract from your wonderful designs or compete with them.
    Then some distinction between your details and the menu list of your work would
    be good. Perhaps even highlighting the relevant description from the list, by
    means of colour or tabbing would make the navigation easier.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/highlight_5403.png]\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the usual threats at the bottom about copyright, copying, stealing your or your
    clients posessions would be good ;-)"

    to individual projects. I'd design a simple stark homepage from which to direct
    the viewer to thumbnails to see larger work or put the thumbnails on the homepage.

    another font instead of Courier help? I dunno, maybe it's the look and feel, but
    Courier gives me the creeps and really feels like a student's website, IMHO. It's
    an odd contrast, given that your work is pretty polished."

    was \u2013 change the courier, please. I downloaded FontCase recently and came
    across the web safe fonts nicely laid out and realized how many fine choices there
    are. \r\n\r\nNot sure why courier gets a bad rap. It would take a lifetime to
    figure out the tangential effect fonts have on everyone. Which is why I go with
    the majority vote if there is one. Anyway, thanks! "

    for web safe fonts. I agree with Sharon, I like that the work is upfront, no flash
    and that it's easy to see. Maybe you could include examples of some of the detailing?
    That would be nice as well. Another thing, maybe you could condensed all the logos
    you've done into one heading. Might look like less work, but will come across
    tidier I think.

  body: "Great site, great work. Wow.\r\n\r\nRe controlling fonts over Javascript:
    You're probably referring to the <em>@font-face</em> embedding technology? The
    problem with that is, as far as I know, it only works on a handful of browsers
    yet. So it's still good advice to stick with the usual suspects in terms of fonts.
    \r\nYou know you can specify an array of fonts in CSS? So you could always specify
    Lucida Grande, plus some other sans to fall back on in case Lucida isn't installed.\r\nMaybe
    also look into the new MS Clearview fonts (Calibri, Consolas, Constantia, Cambria,
    etc.) as options, they're quite nice for screen reading.\r\n\r\nBtw, that nav.png
    doesn't seem to work. :-("

    don't have a font specified as a back up for Lucida Grande so it may come up as
    Times on windows machines. I'm curious to see how it opens on your computers tho.

    a comment for work \"under the hood\" though; add at least a few META keywords

  body: "Shari,\r\n\r\nCongrats on the improvements you're making on your website.\r\n\r\nOne
    odd thing remains for me as I view it in IE7: some of the items have a drop-out
    white box behind them, while others do not. I suspect this is not intentional,
    but perhaps there is some rational that I don't perceive. (BTW, if you change
    it to make the items display uniformly, I strongly prefer showing the items without
    a box around them.)\r\n\r\nI also have a suggestion for you: implement a tag for
    each of your menu entries so that when the cursor is over an item, a tag pops-up
    with a repeat of the information you currently show below the item after you actually
    click on the link. This will allow the viewer to decide if the item is one that
    interests him or her.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When
