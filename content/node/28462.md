  been setting some documents in FileMaker, to export from records. I had neatly made
  use of all of its (very limited) capabilities to make them not-bad-looking. So I
  was a little surprised when I was instructed to eliminate widows and orphans \u2013
  I looked back over the document, found none \u2013 and asked again, and was told
  that I ought to be putting in non-breaking spaces in order to get rid of three-character
  or less words at the ends of lines. Yeah, lines, not paragraphs or columns or pages.
  <!--break-->For example:\r\n\r\n<code>This is not an acceptable block of text because
  it\r\nhas a first line with a two-character entity at the\r\nend. And a second,
  whereas the following, third line \r\nis okay because I've carriage-returned \u201Cis\u201D.</code>\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone heard of this ? Apart from being maddeningly tedious, is this standard practice?
  I can't quite figure out the sense of it. "

    of a line before a hyphen (in fact I set that up as a preference in H&Js), but
    a whole word? Never been asked to do that before. \r\n\r\nIs the text justified
    or rag right? If the latter it sometimes looks bad if a short word hangs off to
    the right but that is certainly not the case in your sample."

  body: "I go through my documents to turn them over if, for example, they are on
    the longest line of a block of text or if there is a ladder of one, two or three
    character words at the end of consecutive lines, I also prefer to turnover the
    first word of a sentence if it is short.\r\n\r\nThe reason is to achieve a smooth
    rag, but I do hate being dictated to by a bit of software, rebel against its tyranny
    if you think your setting looks good:)\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n<em>Edit: I should have
    mentioned that I normally only do this for ragged right, although ladders are
    more of a problem for justified text</em>"

  body: "What an odd idea, and something I've never run into before either.\r\n\r\nThe
    only rationale I can think of, particularly with a ragged right margin, would
    be if your font size/line length proportion was exceptionally unusual (i.e., small
    font/long line) where, indeed, you might get an excessive number of two- or three-letter
    words hanging out consecutively, particularly if there is no hyphenation.\r\n\r\nBut
    there are lots of other solutions to that situation too."

  body: "The logic may be that articles and propositions should not be separated from
    the following word because that's too much of a \"broken meaning clump\". This
    practice would help eliminate that. The worst example is when a two-word phrase
    is emphasized, either by quote marks or italics, and broken over two lines. \r\n"

  body: "I do this quite often with my ragged right settings. I don't like little
    words at the ends of lines. The wordspace before the little word is too close
    to the end of the line and makes the little word look like it's hanging in space.
    I also like to massage the rag so it isn't quite so ragged, and if that means
    moving a word down a line even if it fits the measure, I'll do that too. I might
    even track an individual line a little bit to help the rag.\r\n\r\nAlso, I agree
    with Nick's comments.\r\n\r\n(They certainly are not called orphans or widows.)"
