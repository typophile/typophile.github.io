body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy questions would probably appear quite obvious to you, but
  I have failed to find any answer around Google or in the AFDKO specs (perhaps because
  I'm not using the good keywords?)\r\n\r\nI'm using a spanish OTF font with (Lua)Latex
  which shows some minor problems for my language (french, namely) and, for example,
  comes with very tight-kerned apostrophe. I use a .fea file in Latex to add some
  space around it, and fix some exotic glyph combinations. \r\n\r\nFirst, I have very
  few specific problems with the italic variant, and would like to create a my-kerning-it.fea
  which, first, loads my standard file (namely my-kerning-rm.fea) to apply it to the
  italics, and, 2nd, adds one or two more positionning lines specificaly made for
  italics, instead of having to copy and paste from one file to another each time
  I'm tuning the standard roman .fea file. Is it possible to do so?\r\n\r\nSecond
  problem, when I'm writing my file, I'm trying to cover any possible variants of
  a character, and uses long lists of glyphs, like:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>pos L quoteright'
  10 [A Aacute Abreve Acircumflex Adieresis Agrave Amacron Aogonek Aring Aringacute
  Atilde];</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIs there any glyph class by default, eg. <em>@A_&_variants</em>
  like the <em>@smallcaps</em> one cited in the 2.g.ii. part of the [[http://web.archive.org/web/20081207035530/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.g|AFDKO
  file syntax help]] from Adobe? (Note I'm using an old one, for compatibily reason
  in Latex.)\r\n\r\nThanks for attention,\r\n\r\nPC"

  body: "All names used for classes in the <code>.fea</code> file are lost when the
    <code>.otf</code> font is generated. I can see no way  to  access those classes
    from a <code>.fea</code> file to be used with LuaLaTeX.\r\n\r\nIf I understand
    well the other question, you would like a way to include a generic <code>.fea</code>
    file in other <code>.fea</code> files instead of copying its content for each.
    According to your reference, there is indeed an  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20081207035530/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#3\">include
    command</a>  that should do exactly that but I don't know if LuaTeX implements
    it or not. "

  body: "Hi Michel and thanks for your answer.\r\n\r\nFor the first question, I have
    found something that help me a little, an <a href=\"https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond/blob/master/featurefiles/Regular/classes.fea\">.fea
    class file</a> from another Latex package, Eb Garamond, with a lot of class definitions.\r\n\r\nThe
    <em>include</em> command works fine, so the files are linked as I wished. The
    problem is now how to switch from one variant to another in Luatex without using
    each time an huge custom command like:\r\n<em>\\setmainfont{Fontname}[FeatureFile={my-kerning-it.fea}]</em>\r\ninstead
    ot the standard <em>/textit{}</em> one.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a problem that could
    be solved from the .fea file with an <em>Ifdef</em> command, as I see in <a href=\"http://get-software.net/fonts/amiri/sources/amiri.fea\">that
    one</a>: \r\n<em>ifdef ITALIC\r\ninclude \"italic.fea\"\r\nendif</em>\r\n\r\nBut
    it's not working for me, and I can't find any documentation about that <em>Ifdef
    italic</em> command in the AFDKO reference file. I think I'm gonna let the italics
    standard kerning for now, until I find a way to use it the standard way in Luatex."

  body: "I am still not sure I understand what you want. If you simply want to use
    <code>\\textit</code> to switch font and get the proper features, the <code>fontspec</code>
    package already allows you to do that. You can specify in <code>\\setmainfont</code>
    not only the features for the italic but even the font you want to use as the
    italic when calling <code>\\textit{}</code>. Here is an example where I asked
    for an c_t ligature in the regular and an s_t ligature in the italic:\r\n<PRE>\r\n\\documentclass[12pt]{article}\r\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\r\n\r\n\\setmainfont[\r\n
    UprightFeatures = {FeatureFile = garreg.fea},\r\n ItalicFont = Garamond Premier
    Pro Italic,\r\n ItalicFeatures = {FeatureFile = garit.fea}]{Garamond Premier Pro}\r\n\r\n\\begin{document}\r\nAction
    station \\textit{action station} \r\n\\end{document} \r\n</PRE>\r\nAnd the output
    is:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ligs_5294.png]\r\nAs you can see the
    c_t ligature is active only for the regular and the s_t ligature is active only
    for the italic, all that with standard LaTeX commands to switch fonts, provided
    you properly specified your choices in  <code>\\setmainfont</code> (there are
    also commands to modify your choices)."
