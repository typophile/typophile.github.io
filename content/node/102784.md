  site and used it as my bands font. I've looked over the free sites through what
  seem to be the obvious categories... I've also been to the font identifier sites
  and am getting nothing. If I see the name, I'd probably remember it...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\np.s.
  The files I'm uploading are from the website... The gradient, drop shadow, and outline
  have all been added and are not the original font.\r\n"
