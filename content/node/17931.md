  tonight about someplace that would convert your typeface in fontlab to a lead typeface.
  Has anyone ever heard of this and if so where?

  body: This has come up before, can't find it with search. I think the advice was
    to pay Mr [[Jim Rimmer]] to cut a set of punches for you. Seems a bit excessive
    when photopolymer plates can be used for letterpress q. inexpensively - maybe
    that's what your friend was thinking of?

  body: "I think a custom cut typeface is not all that expensive as compared to other
    things that are made for the individual. A custom built guitar isn't cheap. It's
    all a matter of priority. If a person is passionate about anything a higher price
    is not a hinderance. \r\n\r\nQuite honestly I have never been asked to design
    and/or cut a metal font, possibly because it's assumed that the price is outrageous.
    Most things I produce in the metal foundry bring me about five dollars an hour.
    That stinks even in Canada, but I do it becuse it feels good, and I've been barred
    from the saloon and the pool hall. \r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"
