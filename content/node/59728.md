  PowderHouse Logo.\r\n\r\nPowderHouse will be mostly web based; products for women
  (beauty and accessories). I researched Fournier and Fontanges and was influenced
  by Fournier, the powdered wig era...I found a comment \"The hairdos are as high
  as a house\". So I combined soft and hard, old and modern.\r\n\r\nThank you for
  your comments.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJudy"

    products want to look youthful, so I'd advise you to stay away from anything that
    says <em>old</em>, such as typographic allusions to the 18th Century.\r\n\r\nIf
    this is a mostly web-based business, it won't cost any more to use color, and
    this type of product calls out for a logo with soft, warm colors.\r\n\r\nWhy did
    they pick the name PowderHouse? Were they thinking of the \"powder houses\" where
    armies used to store gunpowder? If so, maybe they have more of a punk aesthetic
    in mind, an <em>explosion</em> of color. It's a question I'd ask if it were my
    client. "

    used?\r\nPerhaps you have a good reason for that, I love to hear it."
