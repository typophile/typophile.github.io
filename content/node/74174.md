  body: Sophisticated and earthy seem like opposites; like a tuxedo and bib overalls.
    Perhaps you could explain further.

  body: Sumner Stone has some fonts that are both sophisticated and earthy. But they
    look nothing like that.

    a couple of threads on here that list alternatives to those (Google helps)'

  body: Sorry for the vague description. I meant natural/earthy like the example shown
    in the op. I'll try out the ones mentioned. Thank you for your help.

  body: "I can't really find the natural/earthy-ness of the example, but it's all
    perception I suppose.\r\n\r\nIf you like the type in your OP, listen to Sebastian.
    If you like the idea of having true sophistication with an earthy tone, listen
    to Dunwich."

  body: "By oxymoron, I mean types which combine contradictory principles.\r\nHumanist
    sans faces, for instance, which marry the clean, reductive, mechanical ethos of
    the unadorned monoline with something of the quality of hand-made lettering. But
    finding the balance is up to you. A new humanist sans, from Shinntype, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sensibility/\">Sensibility</a>.\r\nAnother
