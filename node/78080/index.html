  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I have a shopping cart SaaS platform which needs a logo. 
What do you think about this?

Avanti means forward in Italian (although my solution is not targeting the Italian market). 
I am thinking about using a superhero theme but I am not 100% sure.

Thanks for the feedback!

		<div class="commentbody">I like the first one, i think you could improve 'rt'; also did you try AVANTICart instead of AVAnTICart?

I'm not sure about superhero: the idea is good, but the way it sounds is makes me feel uneasy and I don't think I would trust a company who had it in their tag line, but hey it's just me.

What font did you use? I like the letter A!:-)

Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you're not the graphic designer creating this Avanti Cart logo, it's REALLY not cool to post the work in progress here. If you don't trust your designer, hire a different one, but you really shouldn't be asking random strangers on the internet to appraise his/her work. A designer is creating work based on your input and your company profile, so us random strangers can't judge fairly without knowing all the same information. 

This forum is primarily for technical advice, but clearly, you're not doing the technical work. Just because there <b>are</b> professional, talented and experienced designers here doesn't mean there aren't also tons of totally uneducated wannabees here, too. I'd say it's about 30% pro, 70% wannabee. Can you tell the difference? No offense, but I really doubt it. Design by committee is probably the #1 most destructive roadblock to creating effective design, and you're including the whole world in your "committee."  

Furthermore, you don't own the copyrights to these designs, and by posting them here you're not only breaking the law, you're opening them up to being stolen. Designers often reuse rejected ideas on new projects; now, your designer can't do that. 

If you were my client....I'd quit. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,

First of all, <strong>I asked for permission before posting the logos public</strong>. It is not about trusting my designer. I just needed some more feedback before making an important decision and I thought this forum could help.

<blockquote>A designer is creating work based on your input and your company profile, so us random strangers can't judge fairly without knowing all the same information.</blockquote>

Second, I don't see why this is different if there's a designer posting the logos or the client. <strong>Does your opinion about the logos changes now what you know I'm not a designer?</strong>

<blockquote>Just because there are professional, talented and experienced designers here doesn't mean there aren't also tons of totally uneducated wannabees here, too. I'd say it's about 30% pro, 70% wannabee. Can you tell the difference?</blockquote>

Even if I cannot tell the difference, doest that mean I should not be asking for input? Come on. Let me judge the feedback I get, it is not for you to worry about.

More feedback is welcomed. Thanks.</div>

Yes, that's exactly what it means. It's kinda like hiring a mechanic to fix your car, and then asking random people walking by if he should replace your brakes or not. Or hiring a guy to paint your house, then wandering into a supermarket and asking people if your hired painter should strip the old paint off, then ask the teenage florist which type of paint and brushes your professional painter should use. Then, go back to your painter and tell him what the florist thinks. Would you ever do that? 

And yes, the opinion of the logos <strong>DOES</strong> change knowing you're not the designer. A logo designer has already done all the homework and research in an attempt to visually communicate the client's message. The client hires a designer because they don't have this skill set --- they often think it's all about "knowing how to draw using a computer" and nothing more. 

So, when a professional designer posts here looking for advice, they're looking for <strong>technical</strong> advice. Kerning issues? Message clear? Style match target market? When a client posts here looking for advice, they're looking for strangers to undercut their designer's decisions. 

So, technically? Your designer is very skilled. The worst part of this logo is the tag line -- which I'm guessing <b>you</b> insisted on, and your designer tried to talk you out of it. So, my advice to you is to give your designer creative freedom and I'll bet the results will be even better. If your message isn't getting through, that's probably because you're not communicating it to your designer. We have no way to tell that here on a forum....</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to finish my first metaphor....

If you're not a mechanic, and you hired one but then asked a bunch of random strangers about fixing your brakes, do you think you'd be capable of judging which random stranger's feedback is worthy? No, probably not. If you knew how to fix brakes, you wouldn't need to hire a mechanic. Even if you did know (how to fix brakes) but still hired a mechanic to do the work, you'd know enough about cars to know the mechanic was fixing them correctly. 

The mechanic asking for advice is totally different --- the mechanic knows which advice is valuable because he knows cars. Not only don't you know cars in this metaphor, mihaibrehar, you <strong>also</strong> don't know how truly little you ever knew about cars in the first place. 

And you're making your poor designer defend him/herself against every non-mechanic that happens to wander by, because you really don't know which advice is valid. If you knew, you wouldn't be asking on a forum.

Dude, you are wrong again. You make too many assumptions, like the one I did not ask for permission before posting.

<blockquote>...they often think it's all about "knowing how to draw using a computer" and nothing more.</blockquote>
Again assumptions...

And about your metaphors - while they are good - and you are missing the point. I really don't have the time to go on trolling and find a counter-methaphor. Your opinion about a work of art should be the same whether it's done by Picasso or by a stranger.

--

I will probably pick the last logo. The one before last looks too much like the Mini logo (the car). And this similarity, btw, was pointed out on a forum (where nobody had a problem with me being a client and not a designer).

Oh yeah, the tag line will be changed. It's not going to be in English anyway. That was more of a placeholder text.
