body: Looking for a book or site or pdf that can walk me through starting my own type
  foundry.  Doesn't need to cover anything about what type of fonts you should start
  with, or marketing, but preferably the business side as far as some boilerplate
  EULA, discussion of legal aspects, what type of corporation, or no corporation,
  the business should be set up as, any licenses required, which government agencies
  I need to register with, etc...
