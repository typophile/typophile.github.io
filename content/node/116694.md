  body: "There was an older font called <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Image-Club-Graphics&ffam=Graphik%20Shadow%20-%20Regular&fid=22b55e4e9110deb9f5f6f268944982b2&fsize=60&text=BODY%20HEAT&fit=1|Graphik

    now.\r\nThere is also <strong>GraphiteShadow</strong> by SoftMaker Software [1995]
    but the name and the date suggest this is a plagiarism (SoftMaker is famous for
    that).\r\nIf you expand a little one of the above you will be very close (they
    have the shadow).\r\n\r\nYou can also start with <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Typodermic&ffam=Nesobrite%20-%20Condensed&fid=1caab99605ba05c4ee27b6fd3a906b57&fsize=60&text=BODYHEAT&fit=1|Nesobrite

    \ I think you will be close enough."

  body: "Thanks, the Graphik/Graphite Shadow look like a good compromise. Although
    they are missing the slight rounding on the characters (specifically noticeable
    on the \"A\") that makes the original look that much softer.\r\n\r\nI'd still
    like to find out what the original is without the shadow[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5360.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhatthefont
    suggests:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/snv/d-extra-condensed/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/ticketbook/light/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/coldfield/regular/\r\n\r\nbut
    none have either the rounded edges or squared bowls"
