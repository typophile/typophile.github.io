body: okay so, i know i probably shouldn&#39;t do this, but I have this font i&#39;m
  working on that has these big swash caps and i kinda want to set the ascent/descent
  as shown in the illustration below. what would be the disadvantages of such a configuration?
  why shouldn&#39;t i do this? or can i get away with it? any insight would be appreciated.

    <BR>Setting your ascent/descent as shown would be pretty  <BR>cumbersome for the
    user - epescially if used in conjuction <BR>with other fonts.

  body: 'No, i meant ascent &amp; descent. These swash letters &#40;Y &amp; R&#41;
    are to be used sparingly and the rest of the letters you see in this example are
    the actual caps. The lowercase is morticed and the descenders and ascenders of
    the lc don&#39;t reach above/below the bounds i&#39;ve set in the above illustration.
    Since the Swash caps are meant to be used sparingly &#40;in one line settings&#41;,
    i thought that it would be silly to set the ascent/descent on these letters unless
    it would cause some cataclysmic problems like chopping off whatever lies above/below
    the boundaries that i&#39;ve set in the above example. <BR> <BR>I guess that should
    have been the original question: if i set the ascent/descent as shown above will
    the regions outside this bounding area still print?'

    have felt that way too at times when I posted a sans font for a crit but I soon
    realized that sometimes it takes people a while. <BR> <BR>The only problem you
    will have printing your font is that you have to be sure to allow enough leading
    so that you don&#39;t overlap other things.  Since this is a display font, that
    should be easy to accomplish.  Diacritics in text fonts on the capitals are often
    above type height and they print but more leading is often needed in CE languages
    where there are lots of diacritics. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the red lines are. <BR>I can assume they&#39;re the
    &#34;normal&#34; baseline and capheight, and I guess you&#39;re worried about
    going too far down/up with the bigger caps. Certainly with the descenders there
    shouldn&#39;t be a problem, and even with the ascenders you should be safe, although
    once you add the accents on the big caps you&#39;ll really be going way up. My
    guess is that <i>some</i> apps will truncate the tops at some point, but not the
    ones that really matter. <BR> <BR>Do some testing. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I should add, I was making a very literal reading of your <BR>question Paul.
    If you were to set your ascent/descent as <BR>the lines show, one would then assume
    the cap height <BR>is 1000 with the swash caps shooting over/under? <BR>This would
    be bad.  <BR> <BR>When in doubt, be conservative with this stuff. I like <BR>to
    keep my cap height between 666 and 714. Usually 666 <BR>because it splits evenly
    and gives a nod to the beast, if <BR>you know what I mean. Then you can set your
    ascent <BR>at something like 750 and the descent at 250. This is <BR>of course
    assuming you have a rather standard design.
