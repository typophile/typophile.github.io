  body: If you licence the font legitimately, it will come with an End User Licence
    Agreement (EULA), which states what and what not you are allowed to do with it.
    EULAs vary from foundry to foundry. Read the EULA.

  body: "Even if you don't have a conscience, why would you want to \"nearly\" duplicate
    someone else's font? \r\nThe troubling line is \"How much of a change in form
    ...\".  This gives the impression that you are trying to see how much you can
    get away with.  If you truly are a designer, you would want to create YOUR OWN
    design. Come up with your own concept for a typeface and do it from scratch.  Is
    it a lot of work? Yes.  Will you make a lot of money from it? No. One of the reasons
    is that there are thieves out in the world who would steal someone else's design,
    do minimal work, and call it their own.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I'm not disagreeing with any of the other comments in the slightest. I would
    point out however, that there are free-as-in-beer as well as free-as-in-GPL fonts
    that you can use as a base font. For example, the license for the Vera family
    specifically allows modification. Keep in mind, that you would need to look at
    the license carefully to see if it will accomodate what you want to do. Really
    this discussion is relating to the possibility that you might want to distribute
    your work to other people. <br>\r\nI think that it's fairly obvious that it is
    sometimes easier to work off of an existing font, even if everything will be changed
    by the time the font is released. For example, it might be usefull to use a font
    like Vera Sans when making a font that looks much different. The type designer
    could print and test functional specimens while only parts of the typeface were
    complete. <br>\r\nThe best way to do this is to have a base font that is completely
    your own, then you can be 100% sure that everything is legal. Personally,I would
    never work off of a font that wasn't kosher because you could never be sure that
    there wasn't some sort of hidden identifier somewhere. "

    open the font, make edits, and save it as a new font under a new name.\r\n\r\nBut
    you can't say it's your font. \r\nYou must keep the credits of all the people
    involved in the original version, and add your name to the list. \r\nAlso, you
    must specify what you have modified in the FONLOG.txt file that must be distributed
    together with your new font.\r\n\r\nWhat's your main motivation to edit and existing
    font?\r\nMaybe you want to fix and error, or tweak the spacing or kerning.\r\nMaybe
    you want to change a glyph that you don't like.\r\nMaybe you want to add diacritics
    to support new languages.\r\nMaybe adding ligatures.\r\nMaybe you want to make
    it a little lighter (or bolder, or condensed or wider) to better suit your printing
    needs.\r\n\r\nI see those kind of modifications with good intentions to be perfectly
    valid, as long as you keep the credits of the original designers. Keep in mind
    that this only applies to Open Source fonts, not commercial ones.\r\n\r\nIf you
    want to modify a commercial font, the right thing to do is to contact the original
    foundry/designer first. Some designers allows modifications to create custom branding
    fonts, some charge a little extra money to allowing the modifications, some others
    don't. \r\nAlways ask the original designers first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
