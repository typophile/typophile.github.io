body: "Well, I'm in the market for a new iMac. \r\n\r\nI did some cursory searching
  for a great deal on one of the newest iMacs.\r\nI'd like to get this setup: \r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\n
  \   * 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\r\n    * 2GB 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM - 2x1GB\r\n    * NVIDIA
  GeForce 8800 GS w/512MB GDDR3\r\n    * 500GB Serial ATA Drive\r\n    * Apple Mighty
  Mouse\r\n    * Apple Keyboard (English) + User's Guide\r\n    * Accessory kit\r\n
  \   * SuperDrive 8x (DVD\xB1R DL/DVD\xB1RW/CD-RW)\r\n    * 24-inch glossy widescreen
  LCD\r\n    * AirPort Extreme\r\n    * Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR\r\n\r\nI'd also add iWorks
  '08\r\n\r\nAt Apple.com without my employee discount the total is = <strong>$2,414.68</strong>
  (includes $136.68 for tax) Free Shipping with the discount it's = <strong>$2269.46</strong>
  (includes $128.46 for tax) Free Shipping. \r\n\r\nAt Macmall.com, the same computer
  with iWorks '08 AND <em>Extensis Suitcase Fusion for Mac</em> = $2396.96 - $224.08
  (in a total of 3 mail-in rebates) = <strong>$2172.88</strong>. The website didn't
  say it includes tax, but if it does it would be $141.77 more = $2314.65 (if you're
  curious, Extensis Suitcase Fusion is $99.99 - $90 MIR.) The tax for PA is 6% and
  usually applies to the total before MIRs and S&H are added.\r\n\r\nObviously, Macmall
  is the better deal (unless, of course taxes are included.)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of any other discounts or sites that are offering bargains right now on the new
  iMac? I don't mind paying more if there are MIRs or worthwhile add-ons. A new printer
  is not a worthwhile add-on however.\r\n\r\nI've been out of the MAC game for about
  6 years now, it's time I get back in it. "

    rebates are just adding to the mess that would likely turn into. Google both \"MacMall
    support\" and \"MacMall rebates\" and then rethink the 'better deal' ;o)\r\n\r\nWays
    to save a few bucks on Macs:\r\n\r\n - Amazon and 'forget' to pay sales tax\r\n
    - Apple.com refurbs\r\n - find a .gov employee who can sponsor a .gov discount
    for you (saves about the amount you'd pay on taxes)\r\n - Shop around for your
    own Ram. You can usually save a few bucks that way.\r\n - Buy the low-end model
    of any product line rather than the high end model. In general, the higher end
    models don't give you the same ROI for the price. IMHO, you save money and have
    better equipment if you buy low-end, but upgrade more often. Not to mention that
    upgrading more often allows you to retain more of your resale value of the current
    box."

  body: "<cite>Buy the low-end model of any product line\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nVery
    good advice for most designers. Unless the machine will be used for video production,
    3D, or playing games under Windows, the basic Apple systems still scream through
    just about everything. Use the money saved to buy gobs of RAM, tho, because it\u2019s
    easy to max out 2 gigs with just iTunes, a browser, and a few CS3 apps running."

    of the page. I don't know if you can get your exact specs, but I got my iMac and
    my laptop there and saved approx $1200 total on the two.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree, buy
    the low end machine. The difference is usually ultimately pretty negligable.\r\n\r\nThe
    refurb machines are either machines that were opened and returned or machines
    that had problems that were fixed. They come packaged just like new machines and
    with the same guarantees. The guy I spoke to in the Apple Store agreed that refurb
    was the way to go."

  body: Most electronic components fail because of defects in the first few days of
    use. If a refurb. has failed and was sent back for repair there is a logical case
    to be made that it will be less likely to fail in the future because the other
    components have been tested past their probable point of failure.

  body: "Darrel, good points and most of them I follow regularly. However, an all-in-one
    machine is more so the exclusion than the norm. Most of the components aren't
    easily accessible, let alone upgradeable.\r\n\r\nI am however upgrading the RAM
    myself (I've found a 4 GBs for half the price of Apple's). \r\n\r\nAnd you're
    probably right on the ROI. For the small jump in processing speed is it really
    worth it to go to the 3.06Ghz from the 2.8? Maybe not. But if you factor in the
    graphic card (the new one has a 512mb card, the refurb has 256mb), then things
    start to even out a little more.  Again, it goes back to what's upgradeable and
    what isn't. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I know what I want, I just want to see if I can find
    the best deal on it. And I am in the US, and my employee discount is decent (we're
    a government contractor, so it's probably on par.)"

    he sent it back to receive the newer model for the same price. It had been taken
    out of the box, so I''m sure it had to end up as refurbished. The point of my

    was ever anything wrong with it.  '

    better 6 months from now. I just upgraded after 7 and went for the low, it's still
    like rocket fuel compared to what I'm used to and it's hundreds cheaper.\r\n\r\nYes,
    anything out of the box is a refurb whether or not there was anything wrong with
    it."

  body: The glossy screens do have the advantage of being easier to clean and not
    making rainbows when you poke at them (being generally more resistant to poking).
    The matte screens are easier to look at, but are harder to replace than your keyboard
    when you spray coffee through your nose.

  body: "you're obviously going to get an iMac no matter what, now I don't know about
    iMac deals, but I do know about a couple of other things I wish somebody had told
    me as soon as I got my iMac.\r\n\r\n1) the iMac is an amazing machine, and the
    more you look at it, the more you realize how awesome it is.  Did you know every
    mac since 2005 comes equipped with optical audio in/out, just in case you need
    pure digital audio feeds.\r\n\r\n2) Bluetooth is amazing.  every mac has it, and
    so does the Nintendo Wii.  It's a little pricey, but dorpping 45$ on a Nintendo
    Wiimote when I don't even have a Wii was one of the best investments I've made
    this year.  using Darwiin remote (free) or RemoteBuddy (40$) you can use the Wiimote
    as a remote control for your iMac, and if you have a sensor bar, even as a wireless
    mouse!\r\n\r\n3) Quicksilver.  It's like a program-launcher, only way way more
    powerful, and it's now open-source.  Forget dragging a million icons into your
    dock and then having to hunt to find the program you want, now I open any program
    on my computer with a thought and 3-5 keystrokes (which is faster than you can
    read the aplication name when it appears on your screen anyway)\r\n\r\nBest of
    luck with your new love,\r\ninnovati!"
