  like the style of this font but I don't like the cross behind each character. And
  I'm not a big fan of the short top horizontal on the 'E'\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lorde_park_5881.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  will be keeping a fairly wide kerning of the font I think.\r\n\r\nObviously, the
  logo will be made more detailed and unique but I wanted to see if I could get any
  recommendation for fonts before continuing.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: For this kind of feel, i quite like Augustea (not Berthold's Augustea, but
    the old Nebiolo typeface), but all the digital versions seem to be of the open
    version. Of course removing the open parts would be simple enough in illustrator...
