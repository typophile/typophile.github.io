    target="_blank"> Chalet London 1970</a>, but  <BR>maybe there&#39;s an actual
    typeface that looks like that.

  body: David, do you happen to have a more complete sample  <BR>of the proper weight
    or a link? I agree on the &#34;U&#34;  <BR>shape &#40;though the proportions are
    quite different&#41;  <BR>but I&#39;d like to see the other characters &#40;&#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;p&#34;  <BR>for example which are not similar at all&#41; before I  <BR>change
    the ID. THX.
