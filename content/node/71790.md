    shop (two/three blocks away). they gave me 350+ cards for around $100.00.\r\n\r\n@ratbaggy

  body: "Well done. As a minimalist and functionalist I would recommend the following:\r\n\r\n1.
    Use a consistent baseline grid throug out\r\n2. Letterspace the caps <em>ever</em>
    so slightly\r\n3. Tighten the top margin by a few points\r\n4. Try it without
    the line\r\n\r\nKerning would be worth investigating, but that's rapidly approaching
    the law of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns\">diminishing
    returns</a> (good enough is good enough)."

  body: "Hello There:\r\n\r\nThe hyphens needed to have been baseline shifted upwards
    to align with the midline of the numerals (for instance, the \u201Cwaist\u201D
    of the number 8).\r\n\r\nOther than that\u2014it\u2019s truly lovely.\r\n\r\nPlease
    post the name of the printer from which you got such a fabulous deal on letterpress.\r\n\r\nMike
