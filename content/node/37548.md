  screen displays (View attachments). \r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any idea why this
  happens? Any suggestions to avoid this quirk on an otherwise superb typeface?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's a problem with the hinting.\r\nIf you're making bitmap files, the answer
    is simple: just work larger and scale down.\r\nPlay around with different screen
    magnification -- with the exception of fonts which have been painstakingly hinted
    size-by-size for screen (and there are very few of these) most fonts have non-size-specific
    hinting instructions which fall victim to glitches at certain sizes.\r\n\r\n"

    the same problem on an in-house powerpoint; for instance, where it's still text
    and not an image?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    that the font vendor (DTL) should fix. So I'd recommend asking DTL for a corrected
    version. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"
