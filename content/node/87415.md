  is (visibly) installed, Apple Keynote <strong>constantly</strong> complains with
  an error that it can\u2019t be found (since it\u2019s listed under \u201CITC Lubalin
  Graph\u201D). This error happens whenever one of us at work sends a document to
  another, even though we are all using the same (licensed) copy of Lubalin Graph.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone encountered this before? Would it help if I renamed the font internally with
  eg. Fontographer or a similar tool?\r\n\r\n[[http://cl.ly/0K0m172G0A1N2s3o3s2C|full-size
