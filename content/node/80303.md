  I am working for and for which I wanted your opinion.\r\n\r\nKeywords: proud but
  simple, embrace (close) and atmosphere\r\n\r\nMy question: which mark do you think
  works best?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mark01_4039.jpg]\r\n// MARK
  1\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mark02_6191.jpg]\r\n// MARK 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concept_6413.jpg]\r\n//
  Concept\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mark_variations_5194.jpg]\r\n//
  Variations on mark 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe S is the first letter
  of the name of the company.\r\nAnd the colors were choosen by feeling. Afterwards
  I noticed these were red, green and blue as in RGB (different order, though).\r\n\r\nWould
  appreciate your comments.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nRay\r\n\r\n "

    about seb: What is missing is the name and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 payoff which
    give it a base. Then that problem will not rise. Apart from that, I don't experience
    it the way you do. But will have a look at it.\r\n\r\n@riccard0: I know exactly
    what you mean. I think that is what makes me doubt a bit. Thanks for your 50 cents.

    analysis is a little lost in the logo.  To me, it resembles a ribbon, which I
    guess usually connotes unity, flow etc.'

  body: "@Trevor:\r\nThank you for your comment. You do have a point there!\r\nThe
    logo has already been approved. So I can not make any more changes.\r\nHowever,
    one of the pillars of the agency also is involvement.\r\nSo in that sense it still
    stands for me. The concept - however - has been dilluted some what. I agree.\r\n\r\n"
