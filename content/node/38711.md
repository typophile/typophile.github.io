  to be designing a personal logo, stationery, etc. I'll be graduating in May (finally!),
  and am ready to go out into the \"real world.\" I've been working on this mark for
  a while now, and I feel it's at a point I'm happy with, so I'm ready for your insightful
  critiques to improve it further! I'm going to start soon on my name placement, typography,
  etc., but I wanted to nail this mark first.\r\n\r\nMy design style <em>tends</em>
  to be, in a few words, complex, clean and somewhat delicate/elegant, but not really
  feminine (unless the job calls for femininity). I also have a slightly unhealthy
  obsession with typography (as opposed to other design elements). I hope that makes
  sense; let me know if it doesn't...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CassieLogo_5455.gif]"

    I can't believe I didn't see the g's before! Thanks for pointing that out. It
    is constructed solely out of lowercase italic c's and a modified lc italic f (my
    initials). I hope the g's aren't too strong ..."

    want to emphasize it as your initials, it's really pleasing to the eye as a mark.

    in there, but I don't think the viewer needs to recognize any single letter. That's
    not necessarily the point. It's nice to see a logo someone has clearly put time
    into refining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful and something ugly almost
    always works."

  body: "So I brought up the \"g\" thing in class, and it was a general consensus
    that that should be fixed, if possible. Here's my solution, which I think has
    much nicer Gestalt, anyway. I agree that the letters don't need to be \xFCber-recognizable,
    but I'd like to keep some nuances of them, if possible. Thoughts on this one?
    Better? Worse? Ways to improve it? Is the center too strong of a focal point (I
    kinda feel like it detracts from the nice flow of the outside of the shape...)?
    I know I'm into the final tweaking, but any suggestions are helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4_3424.gif]"

    as type, which is a great interest of mine.\r\nAs it is a personal mark, it is
    very difficult for me to explain its communicative value as I would any other
    mark. I guess the above is as good as I can do, without revisiting all the \"who
    is the brand called Cassie\" stuff I figured out before starting on this mark...
    it's so true that designing something for yourself is the hardest thing to do
    as a designer."

    at all. However, I don't want to ignore the possibility that some may see that,
    as it is something to be seriously considered. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone else see this?
    Is it something that should be addressed? or is the mark far enough from that
    to hold any sort of connotation? That would be, of course, the last thing I would
    want any logo (especially my personal mark) to imply..."
