  various combinations of accented I characters end up in that sequence, if at all?\r\n\r\ni.e.
  \r\n\r\nIacute_T_Iacute ligature\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nIacute_T_Idieresis ligature\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to keep it simple but accommodate the possible combinations, I'm not familiar
  with how accented characters are used, if ever, in sequence. (whether mixed or consistent)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    its feminine forms <em>l\xEDtil -- l\xEDtin</em> and plural <em>l\xEDtillar</em>
    (meaning little or small) is an everyday-word that is also used in a whole bunch
    of compound-words, and then there's the adverb <em>l\xEDtit</em>. There are other
    words with this combination, but this is probably the most frequently used. \r\n"
