    Italian or Sweedish etc clocks have numbers in their language or are they English
    numbers? Sorry if i''m being too naive, I haven''t really been aborad to notice.
    Just curious. '

    body: haha, not a wind up! Not at all. I have never been to places outside UK
      in and around Europe. So how am I meant to know?!? Ok, so UK analogue clocks
      or watches. What kind of typeface do they tend to use. Is there any specific
      reasons as to why they would use certain typefaces? I've usually seen more of
      san serif on wall clocks and more of serif on watches. Or am I wrong? Educate
      me! I'd like to know. Curiosity never killed the cat did it? :)

  body: "Missgiggles, most clock fonts here in Sweden are set in Exocet, but instead
    of the number 7 we use the symbol \xC6 because of a treaty signed with Denmark
    in 1974.  My brother Erik lives in glorious Nippon (Japan) and there they use
    Roman numbers on their wall clocks as well as their digital wristwatches.  But
    don't be confused, lol, their clocks read counterclockwise because their language
    reads in a different way than English.  "
