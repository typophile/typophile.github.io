body: Hello Typophiles - <BR>I am new to this board, so let me introduce myself before
  I ask for your help.  I am attending college at Kansas State University in....Kansas
  &#40;go figure&#41;.  Graduation is scheduled for the fall of &#39;05, although
  I am considering pursuing Graduate school.  I am an avid mountain biker and soccer
  player.  <BR> <BR>For the last few days I have been pondering about creating a logo
  to use for promoting and identifying myself.  I work on a medium amount of freelance
  projects, and I thought it would be nice to have something to put on a business
  card when I am networking with people &#40;i.e. drunken shmoozing&#41; <BR> <BR>In
  the back of my head I would like to steer this towards being a pretty strong graphic
  symbol, that I could then apply variations to in the form of ornamentation/texture.  The
  thing that really got this all started was a discussion about printers marks - <BR>here
  is a link to some...<a href="http://www.lib.iastate.edu/art/printmk.html">printers
  marks</a>.  I think I would like to base it around my intitials in some form, but
  you have any other suggestion let me know.  Here is one that I have come up with,
  its rough....HAVE AT ME! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hello, Shawn, welcome to Typophile. <BR> <BR>What does this mark, which you&#39;ve
    posted, mean to you? And do you feel it is saying that? I read nothing about design,
    but I can see communication.

    that plane being things created in the physical world.  I seem to have double

  body: So it is Friday and I&#39;ve had too much Chinese food for lunch.  can see
    what you see.  <BR> <BR>As you are also into the outdoors I&#39;ll mention that
    it &#40;sort of&#41; strikes me as a petroglyphic mark. &#40;Probably used the
    wrong word there too.&#41; But, do you feel as if it is too simple? Or not simple
    enough?  <BR> <BR>everyone double posts. it happens.

  body: 'I like it. Maybe because it&#39;s open to interpretation, but there&#39;s
    clearly some mutual movement &#40;communication&#41; going on. <BR> <BR>I might
    make it more compact though, and add some irragularity, like in that St Albans
    Mark - or like the Koch symbols: flares at the ends of strokes and somewhat &#34;off&#34;
    arrowheads, although it&#39;s not easy to make that look intentional and not like
    a mistake. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '- on your point tiffany i can see where you say that it doesnt correlate
    with design directly or even obviously.  But to be honest I find that many time
    artists logos or designers logos are fairly obvious, i.e. a paintbrush.  While
    I think that this is excellent if done well, many times it is not.  I also tend
    to be more of an abstract thinker.  So it fits my personality... <BR> <BR>- hrant,
    i agree with what you say about adding irregularity.  I also think it is tough
    to make it seem intentional.  I am going to try a variation with more of a &#34;serifed&#34;
    feel to it.  By compact do you mean more of a even height and width? <BR> <BR>thanks
    for the suggestions guys.'

  body: The connotations of &#34;up and down&#34; are very strong and have a lot of
    baggage. People seeing the abstract motion of ideas are likely to vaguely think
    &#34;there&#39;s a good one and a bad one.&#34; What if you rotate it?
