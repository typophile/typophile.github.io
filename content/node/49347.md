body: "Just been thinking about cedilla options. Microsoft typography says this...\r\n\r\n<dd>\r\nUnder
  comma and cedilla\r\n\r\nThe under comma is the preferred form in the Romanian language
  for the uppercase characters S and T with under comma accent and lowercase s and
  t with under comma accent. Four new Unicode values have been defined to accommodate
  this preference: Scommaaccent U+0218 ; scommaaccent U+0219 ; Tcommaaccent U+021A
  ; tcommaaccent U+021B\r\n\r\nThe connecting cedilla is the preferred form in the
  Turkish language for the uppercase S with cedilla and lowercase s with cedilla:
  Scedilla U+015E ; scedilla U+015F\r\n\r\nAn under comma is an acceptable alternative
  to a connecting cedilla for the following characters: Ccedilla U+00c7 ; ccedilla
  U+00e7 ; Kcedilla U+0136 ; kcedilla U+0137 ; Lcedilla U+013b ; lcedilla U+013c ;
  Ncedilla U+0145 ; ncedilla U+0146 ; Rcedilla U+0156 ; rcedilla U+0157 ; Tcedilla
  U+0162 ; tcedilla U+0163\r\n\r\nIn the Portuguese and Catalan languages the traditional
  connecting style of a cedilla is more commonly preferred for the Ccedilla U+00c7
  and ccedilla U+00e7.\r\n\r\nIt is common in modern designs and French typography
  to see a cedilla design with a stroke that is not connecting or as in common handwriting,
  a line that passes through the bottom or beneath the uppercase or lowercase c.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\nAre
  Microsoft right, should I do what they say? \r\n\r\nWho is the authority on cedillas?\r\n\r\nDoes
  my cedilla have to be a traditional shape? Would an undercomma-style cedilla on
  my ccedilla and scedilla offend or upset French/Turkish/Portuguese/anyone else?
  Should I just knuckle down and design a traditional cedilla that connects with the
  c and s?\r\n"

    the article you have is ALMOST right. Albeit in Portuguese or Catalan we don't

    I believe that we should use a undercomma as an stylistic option for two reasons:\r\n\r\n-
    Undercommas and cedillas have different origins, so they should be distinctive
    (as a cultural mark);\r\n- With the normalization on a Western alphabet of fonetic

  body: very interesting. P22 Underground Pro has both, but the comma form as the
    default. in my research here for my dissertation, i have found that language specific
    preferences for forms are not always hard and fast. these types of considerations
    usually come down to the tastes of the user. in my opinion, options like these
    may be better served as stylistic alternates or sets, especially where there is
    some debate about what forms are appropriate as in this case, or in the case of
    'Bulgarian' forms for cyrillic, or in the case of language specific forms for
    Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. another argument for stylistic alternates/sets is
    that major languages are not confined to one geographical location and are not
    bound by a single culture. native French and French-speaking Canadians will likely
    have different customs for how they use different forms, as will native Spanish
    and Spanish speakers from the americas, &c. so in my opinion, it doesn't really
    matter which form you use as a default, as long as you are aware that there are
    other options and that you make these options available to the user. of course
    this is tricky with the current state of application support... but that onus
    is upon others and not typeface designers.

    Imagine that you are Portuguese and you use cedillas quite often. You press your
    \"\xE7\" button on your keyboard (yes, we use it that much that we need a specific
    button) and you get a \"c\" with a undercomma. Not good. It should be default,

    So, alternatives should be the new, default should be the old.\r\n\r\nJong - Well,
    that case isn't so violent. Undercommas are vertical and cedillas, because of
    the semi-circle shape, seem more diagonal. In fact, in writing, most people use
    a quarter of circle (right-bottom quarter), connected to the base.\r\n\r\nBut
    it could be better, indeed."

    was the crux of my whole post above. It would be a pain in the arse to make different

    editors, don\u2019t know of undercomma as being different from cedillas.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhy
    then insist on designing different ones?\r\n\r\nAs long as a language only knows
    either cedilla or commaaccent but not both, the actual difference or non-difference
    between them does not matter as long as it is clear -- in contrast to yet <em>other</em>
    diacritic marks -- that within a text of this language, a certain shape stands
    for cedilla, or commaaccent.\r\nPaul Hunt's interpretation of cedilla is particularly
    interesting in this regard. Think of it as todays zigzag z shape, slightly rotated,
    rather than the round one which not in use any more (illustration from Mr Cordoba's
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia link</a>).
    The only difference between this cedilla and commaaccent is connection vs non-connection.
    Now imagine the cedilla being unconnected (i.e. the commaaccent) but closer to
    the letter, and all this printed at 10pt. I bet that while reading you would not
    notice that they are unconnected except if you were told before.\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I think that internationalization of type design, the need to cover more and more
    diacritic letter, goes hand in hand with \"evening out\" of national peculiarities.
    Cedilla vs commaaccent. Flat vs steep acute/grave.\r\nPersonally I am more and
    more reluctant to make statements about what French or Portugese or Turks or Germans
    \"want to see\". Actually designers can get away with quite uncommon solutions
    that are not wrong at all, and without anybody noticing as long as it is still
    clear what a word or text means. In Germany you will find Turkish shops that use
    a dot instead of cedilla below c/s, or macron/dot instead of breve above yumusak
    g.\r\nThis does not mean that typographers and type designers should stop caring.
    It is us who keep up typographic quality. And by choosing one or another letterform
    we even make a statement about its assumed origin. (E.g. the shape of eszett exhibits
    whether it was interpreted as longs+s, longs+z or longs+diacritic mark, none of
    them being \"wrong\".) Yet we should be pragmatic and not insist on certain rules
    just to show off that we belongs to those \"who know\".\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nLooks like
    this was a very good year both for KABK and Reading.\r\n\r\n[A bit repetitive

    Michael:\r\n\r\nI don't even know that Newspaper it's probably a local one...
    but that doesn't matter, what matter is that, the ones making these changes are
    probably the typographers that don't use the cedilla. If you check the Dax you
    just posted, for me its ok, its like a simplified version of the cedilla but not
    a comma, i would even say that they know what a cedilla is when they designed
    the typeface (joke). Now... only a small number of people could have this discussion
    and actually care about it cus in fact... i never ever thought about this \"problem\"
    and i really don't care much to say the truth cus no matter how you make a cedilla
    or a tilde it will always me a cedilla and a tilde... it's like Obama said the
    other day... a pig with lipstick is still a pig. Being Portuguese, adopted by
    Catalans and had a Turkish girlfriend ( and have family in France lol) this is
    pretty clear to me :)\r\n \r\nTo Thomas:\r\n\r\nActually having it detached doesn't
    change it at all because people recognize it as a \"\xC7\" always and if you check
    the Turkish alphabet that has a lot of cedillas and under commas... the letters
    that have a cedilla don't have a under comma and so on... so even if you during
    handwriting make no difference between the under comma and the cedilla it will
    always be read correctly. As for Romanian... there's always the context to help
    reading it properly. Almost all Romanian computer texts still use S-cedilla or
    even S instead of the under comma S because the character simply didn't existed
    in unicode.\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is my opinion :) I think I don't have much more to

    I know neither Spanish nor Italian. I think the old \"\xE7\"   may now just be

    stating to always write \"\xE7\" and not \"z\" when a cedilla was used in the

  body: "It seems to me that there should be no reason for confusion here.\r\n\r\nAn
    undercomma is one accent, a cedilla is another.\r\n\r\nBut typefaces have different
    stylistic characteristics. So a particular modernistic typeface might have a disconnected
    cedilla. That's fine - it's a characteristic of the typeface, and if people find
    the typeface unattractive because of this characteristic, as for any other reason,
    they can use another one.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that makes it complicated is that,
    thanks to OpenType, typeface designers have the option of offering more than one
    form for characters. Well, that's a plus. Which one is the default? The one that
    corresponds to the designer's vision for the typeface; again, I'm hard put to
    argue against that in principle. It is, of course, incumbent on the designer to
    have a vision that accords to the requirements of his target market, and so one
    might wish to discourage overly self-indulgent experimentation... but some typefaces
    are going to be more avant-garde than others. (Personally, I incline to interest
    in conventional and traditional typefaces, but I don't want to label the people
    who make the other kind of typeface as 'bad'; we need display faces too.)\r\n\r\nBut
    this thread has brought up an issue of cultural consciousness - the problem isn't
    cultural sensitivity; it is not will that is lacking, it is that there is so much
    information to research, often not readily available - that gives another side
    to this argument. A disconnected cedilla might be pleasingly modernistic to the
    French, but to the Portuguese it might be hopelessly confusing.\r\n\r\nSo one
    uses language sensitivity in OpenType. And that would also make the accents slope
    more for Polish.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that OpenType support isn't the greatest
    in some applications. Type designers can't be expected to rewrite those applications,
    but they certainly <em>can</em> make available one font for every set of alternates
    where that alternate is the baseline.\r\n\r\nThis has a benefit when it comes
    to another problem. Just because there are many people in Brazil who aren't used
    to the disconnected cedilla, it does not mean that there won't be someone there
    who wants to use it for its shocking visual effect.\r\n\r\nLanguage sensitivity
    leads to the situation where people might say \"But they don't let me use the
    <em>real</em> Eurostile Next because I'm Brazilian\"!\r\n\r\nSo, while I think
    that if a Century Schoolbook font transparently does what is conventional for
    every language using the Latin script according to its own local rules, there
    are likely to be few complaints, one cannot say that the same approach is unequivocally
    the best one for a display face.\r\n\r\nIt is good for the type designer to be
    as aware of the language issues as possible, but the end user of the font has
    to be allowed to break the rules and use the original appearance of the face instead
    if desired."

    I'm not so sure.\r\n\r\nIf the typeface is a text face, and not a display one,
    that seems to be good advice.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's a question about what \"normal\"
    for a given language <em>means</em>. It is basic and fundamental that an ogonek
    is not a cedilla is not an undercomma. So one is indeed on very safe ground in
    saying that a typeface should not do things that look like nonsense or like ignorant
    errors in any given language. \r\n\r\nWhen type designers are getting their information
    about what is normative for different languages from good sources, they will be
    able to get this right.\r\n\r\nBut I can easily imagine cases where, because of
    the difficulty, as yet, in getting complete information of this sort for all languages,
    people will study existing practice, and come to wrong conclusions. So, if in
    one language, a particular natively-designed typeface has happened to be popular,
    and its accent marks differed in some way from other Roman typefaces of the same
    period, that does not necessarily mean that it is expected that accent marks in
    all typefaces should look the same way.\r\n\r\nAlso, to some extent, the Latin
    script community is a single typographical community, not many different isolated
    national communities any longer. So attempts to meet the needs of different countries
    may end up in part being based on a false premise."

    into a character and a combining diacritic that is then properly positioned by
    a Mark feature without having to care for the kerning (I think that is at least
    true for those Pali characters). Just stop taking end users for dummies and educate
    them instead of prohibiting them from exercising their \u201Cfundamental rights\u201D.\r\n"

    why it was printed with an ogonek?\r\n\r\nPortuguese is the younger Latin-based
    language and Portugal was a periferic country until the great navigations started
    in mid-1400s. As a consequence,  Portuguese from XV Century still shows inconsistencies
    in ortography which were already solved in other languages by that time. And up
    to XVII Century we find improvisations in many printed documents due to a lack
    of proper fonts.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, cedillas and tildes were available
    in insufficient number or simply absent. To produce them, printers used commas
    (under the c to get \xE7) and lowercase l (over a and o to get \xE3 and \xF5).
    This explains samples were cedilla appears disconneted.\r\n\r\nThe sample above
    is also an adaptation using a font without Portuguese support. Besides the e with
    ogonek and the ss inconsistency, there also  different acutes over o and a. As
    the language had not direct connection with German or Polish, it seems they printed
    this document as better as they could."

  body: "This book is in Spanish, not Portuguese. As it is from 1568, it shows a Spanish
    quite different from the modern one. Unification of Castela and Aragon occurred
    in 1469 and during several decades Castilian was still in its path to become the
    axis of modern Spanish. Early Spanish has a much greater influence of Aragonese
    than today. And Aragonese shared some characteristics with Catalan and Proven\xE7al,
    including the cedilla.\r\n\r\nIn both Spanish and Portuguese, C sometimes acts
    as K (caballo, cola, culto), and sometimes as S (acero, cinta). In this book,
    cedilla/ogonek was used to mark these variations. All occurrences of c+a, c+o
    and c+u, where c works as k, are not marked with ogonek. All the other combinations
    use c with ogonek and there are both kind of c in the same line. So it is clearly
    a diacritical usage which was later abandoned in Spanish.\r\n\r\nRegarding the
    old Portuguese grammars omission about cedilla and tilde: tilde was present since
    the very first incarnations of Portuguese. It came from Latin abbreviations for
    -um and -am. As there are extensive of nasalization in Portuguese, tilde become
    an integer part of the language since the beginning. So, I don't know why a grammar,
    even a very old one, would omit the tilde. It is an interesting issue and I would
    like very much to know more about these grammars.\r\n\r\nIn other hand, cedilla
    is not always called an 'accent' and it is usual to describe it as a special sign
    associated to c. This may explain the omission, but this is again a matter to
    deeper analysis.\r\n\r\nFinally, I also thank you all for this discussion. It
    is always amazing to travel through so many centuries."

    (diaeresis) are put above letters, and the cedilla is subscribed. The accents
    are acute, grave and circumflex. In the cnrtl dictionary, the <a href=\"http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/tr%C3%A9ma\">tr\xE9ma</a>

    body: Michel, I agree that these incongruences in old grammars are probably just
      terminological variations through time. Portuguese is quite similar to French
      in this aspect, calling acute, grave, circumflex and tilde as accents. Dieresis
      was also called accent among us, but it was removed after the 2009 reform, already
      valid in Brazil but still not active in Portugal.

  body: "Just now I saw this thread. As a Brazilian, let me add some information.\r\n\r\nAs
    said above, cedilla is the <strong>only</strong> diacritic you find below a character
    in Portuguese. It's also used just with /c/ in /\xE7a/\xE7o/\xE7u/ combinations.
    And it never begins a word. Besides this, our contact with Romanian and Turkish
    cultures are almost none, so Brazilians doesn't know there is a thing like commaccent.\r\n\r\nAlmost
    anything you put bellow a /c/ will be easily read as a cedilla in Brazilian Portuguese.
    It may be a cedilla, a commaccent, a straight line, an acute... all this will
    work because there is no other diacritic to be confused with cedilla. And also
    because cedilla usage, although common, is very specific.\r\n\r\nStudents learn
    to wrote cedilla as an upside-down hook.\r\n\r\nTo design and use disconnected
    cedillas is not an issue to Brazilians. But this is <strong>not a trend</strong>
    in Portuguese. It's just a variation in cedilla shape made possible due to local
    language and culture (I believe the same applies to Portugal). In other hand,
    disconnected cedillas in a traditional serif font may seem strange nowadays. Even
    if this was not unusual in 15th and 16th Centuries, later it seems to be changed
    to an always-connected-shape. Remember that Portuguese is a relatively new language
    if compared to other Romance ones. Its consolidation came just in late 1400s/early
    1500s.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, many people may use wrong cedillas due to lack of
    knowledge about the commaccent existence. The book 'A\xE7\xE3o de cobran\xE7a'
    cited above is a good example. I'm sure its editors have no idea they're using
    a commaccent-like cedilla, especially considering it's a Law book (Law books are
    usually badly designed here).\r\n\r\nBut if one designs a font with international
    support, both cedilla and commaccent clearly distinguished. The designer may even
    adopt a disconnected cedilla if this is suitable to general font style \u2013
    but this cedilla still needs to by clearly different than a commaccent. A 'multi-purpose'
    diacritic seems not acceptable.\r\n\r\nFinally, for me it's quite obvious that
    if one must observe the correct position and shape of other diacritics, as ogoneks,
    exactly the same applies to cedillas. Graphical similarity and some circumstantial
    wrong usage does not justify a font to mix up cedilla and commaccent."
