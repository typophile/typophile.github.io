  if someone else has beat me to it. I figured if anyone knows, it would be you guys.
  \r\n\r\nComments and discussions are welcome.\r\n\r\nI'm not even sure where I originally
  sourced this, possibly the Oswald Cooper Specimens book. I haven't seen that book
  in years, though, and I don't have any scans.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt"

    both take liberties, so IMO something closer to the original would be worthwhile.\r\nAccording
    to The Book of Oz, the alphabet (and matching italic) were done for Paul Hollister's
    book \"American Alphabets\", 1930. This from The Book of Oz:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Oz_5370.png]"

  body: Thanks Nick, that's good information. I'll have to look around for the "American
    Alphabets" book. I know someone who has the Book of Oz, so maybe I can get better
    scans from it as well.

  body: "I was able to get scans from the Book of Oz last night. I'm definitely excited
    to start working on this. I'm such a fan of Oz that the goal will definitely be
    to keep it as close in form to the original as possible.\r\n\r\nI may have to
    make a shorter alternate for that \"t\" in addition to the original, though. IMO
    it's the weirdest part of this set."

    do as the default Matt?"

    original and new.\r\nWhich would you do as the default Matt?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a tough question. I wouldn't want to scare off potential users by having that
    odd \"t\" as the default. On the other hand, keeping the tall \"t\" would be more
    historically accurate. I'm edging towards keeping any updates I deem worthy in
    the alternate set.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cooper3_4492.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    do like the tall \"t\" in this sample. It gives the letters a high class look.
    Plus the ligature looks pretty hot.\r\n\r\nDo you think Cooper Cagliostro would
    be a good name for this font?"

  body: "Cagliostro would be an excellent choice for the name, a recognition of Cooper's
    great wit and love of language. Cagliostro (the man) was a notorious character.
    Among his many skills was forgery, hence the juxtaposition here with Actuality,
    as well as the showing of the two italic \"t\" ligatures. A two-word type specimen
    poem! Cagliostro is a lovely type specimen word in its own right.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Dave Farey has described Highlander as more of a general piece of Ozishness, rather
    than a revival of any particular Oz alphabet.\r\n\r\nI wonder what kind of a typeface
    this \"Cooper Sans\" would have ended up, if it had gone throught the mill at
    Monotype, Linotype or some other foundry? On page 81 of the Book of Oz is a comparison
    of the original lettering of Packard, and the typeface made from it, which might
    be a helpful benchmark in assessing the degree of regularity you wish to add,
    in going from lettering to type.\r\n\r\nI recall discussing this alphabet with
    Richard Kegler some years ago, we had both considered making it into a font. I
    don't know if he took that idea any further; I didn't, although I have always
    considered it to be an astonishingly beautiful design.\r\n\r\nCagliostro was an
    important Mason, master of the secret meaning of letters -- another allusion.
    No doubt there was some connection between masonry, the Black Art of printing,
    and the brotherhood of commercial artists. "

  body: "Indeed. Reading about Cagliostro on wikipedia was quite interesting. I finally
    found a reasonably priced copy of the Oz Book, so I will be sure to view the packard
    items when it gets here.\r\n\r\nI think it would be interesting to make a fully
    different \"commercialized\" version of each letter as alternates. That way the
    font would be as tricky as Cagliostro himself."
