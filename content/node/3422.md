  target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/GSGweb/tTBabout.html</a>&#41; to print out
  specimen books of all of our fonts. This program hasn&#39;t been updated in 6 years
  and isn&#39;t very stable. However, it is the only font printing program I&#39;ve
  found that prints the characters per pica &#40;at every point size from 6-18 I think&#41;.
  As book designers, this helps us estimate page counts for interiors. Is there any
  other newer, more stable program that can do this? We&#39;re unfortunately still
  using OS 9, but we have a few OS X computers if necessary. Thanks!
