  body: "Not Syntax or Lucida Sans, the R is different. Scala also has different R
    and W.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-quay-sans/\">Quay
    Sans</a> is closest, but its M is slightly sloping."

  body: I think you nailed it, M. The M on the sample is sloping as well.

  body: "I think the Foundry idea is good. Form Sans and Journal, both have a similar
    G, R and M. See the samples in the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html\">Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide</a> at Codes 4-61. Quay Sans is at Code 4-62, because I considered
    the M more sloped.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
