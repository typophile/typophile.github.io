  body: "Nice concept.\r\n\r\nI think the text looks a little thin; have you tried
    using bolder fonts? Maybe it is just the font hinting, but the text \"WELLSPRING\"
    looks artificially expanded.\r\n\r\nI think having \"SPRING\" in blue is overdoing
    it. In any case, for such thin letters you would need a brighter blue for it to
    show.\r\n\r\nThe nethermost condensed text could need more tracking. Also, I think
    both the symbol and the text would benefit from a little more space between them.\r\n\r\n@frode,
    I guess the drop stands for the \"wellspring\" and the triangle for the holy Trinity.
    Am I right?"

  body: "mans, you are correct.\r\n\r\nI kerned wellspring apart to the width of the
    design, but after looking at it again it does look a bit too wide. perhaps i'll
    leave it skinnier and not kern the \"christian fellowship\", maybe put them on
    two lines as well. \r\n\r\nheres it with wellspring in bold and shortened up,
    and christian fellowship kearned slightly closer. the text is also a tad farther
    under the symbol.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wellspring4_5086.jpg]"

  body: This weight looks much better. Although in my opinion too much is going on
    with the text. The two lines differ with regard to both font, weight and tracking,
    and possibly size. Changing one of these variables is usually enough -- have you
    tried setting the second line in the same font and weight as the first line, but
    in a smaller grade? Also the text has three different colours; I really think
    black would suffice.

  body: "I'd work on the mark more - I don't think the big, black, bloated triangle
    communicates \"Holy Trinity\". I think the black triangle looks really foreboding.\r\n\r\n
    I like the water drop/cross concept, but the bottom stem looks a bit short & stubby.
    It's closer to a plus sign. Maybe think about trying to communicate \"fellowship\"
    with the drop or instead. Just my thoughts, seen a lot of bad church logo's in
    my day..."

  body: "I'm not sure about the triangle either. BTW, why is it not a clean triangle?
    It looks sort of 3-D. To be honest, the first thing I saw was a teardrop wearing
    a black cape. (But I'm also not a Christian, so maybe I'm just missing some background.)\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried moving the cross off center and making that sorta curved/3D \u2013 you
    know, like it was a reflection on the surface of the drop? Right now it looks
    more like it's standing in front of it. That might give it a bit more interest/life."

  body: 'you can do without the black triangle. it doesn''t help the focal point,
    waterdrop/cross. The cross should probably have a longer stem. it''s a bit short
    imo. have  you tried uncapping "CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP" to "Christian Fellowship".
    Might help lighted text. Look forward to the next round. '

    making the cross look like a reflection, I like that idea, and when I have more
    time I'll try and figure out how to make that work...\r\n\r\ncross is now thinner,
    hopefully fixing the size issue. Drop/inner shadows also now add more depth.\r\n\r\n(images
    aren't working at the moment so I am going to submit then edit this post...)\r\n(hmmm,
    keep getting an error 404 when uploading images, and need to head to class now,
    so I'll try tonight.)"
