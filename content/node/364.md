body: First, let me say that MoMA QNS is a design feast! Nothing quite like going
  to a fine museum to get the juices going. Two ID&#39;s please, &#40;I&#39;ve a feeling
  this will be short and painless&#41;. The exhibit type, MATISSE PICASSO &#40;the
  program had a text in the same font, suprisingly workable&#41;... and the MoMA QNS
  signage/website font below &#40;tell me it?s not Eurostile, it can&#39;t be, and
  don&#39;t say Microgramma either :-&#41;. <BR> <BR>I threw away my program so can&#39;t
  give you a bigger sample. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11787.gif"
