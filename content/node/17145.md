  accute and grave accents as opposed to the more vertical polish-compatible ones.
  Thanks for your help.

  body: "Do all the accents look the same, Nick?\r\n\r\nGiordano, I'm not sure I understand
    your question, by 'horizontal' do you mean more horizontal that e.g. the preferred
    Polish form (which is also a style of accent that one sees more and more in non-specifically
    Polish designs), or actually horizontal lines like Nick shows here?\r\n\r\nI think
    some of the discussion about accent angle has mistakenly focused on the Poles
    liking steep accents, because this is a style, as I note, that is not uncommon
    in e.g. contemporary French design, and is the model I follow for the default
    accents in all my designs. Rather, the focus should be on the Czech preference,
    which is the more distinct cultural preference, for quite flat accents. This is
    one of the reasons why, after my trip to Prague, I became convinced that the only
    way to set the Czech language is to use a Czech typeface. Veronika Burian's <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11497.0.0\">Maiola</a>
    is a good recent design in the Czech tradition that exhibits this form of accent."

  body: On the subject of accent angle in contemporary, non-culturally specific type
    design, the story of Matthew Carter's Fenway is quite interesting. The original
    Fenway has grave and acute accents with angles close to 45 degrees. When Maxim
    Zhukov asked if Matthew would donate copies of the fonts to use in the ATypI Country
    Delegates report a few years ago, Matthew supplied a modified version to set the
    Polish report, so that Polish names would be displayed with steeper accents. The
    publication used both sets of fonts, tailored to different nationalities, much
    to Adam Twardoch's delight. When we came to typeset the ATypI/Graphis publication
    <em>Language Culture Type,</em> Maxim wanted to use Fenway again, and I went about
    making an OpenType version to facilitate the typesetting and added a number of
    diacritics for other languages not supported by the Matthew's fonts (e.g. Chinese
    and Arabic transliteration characters). Matthew at this point decided that he
    preferred the steeper accents he had made for the Polish fonts to the original
    forms, and so these became the default forms in the OpenType font used to set
    <em>Language Culture Type.</em>

    no distinction between 5 and S, or O and 0, relying on context, then the same
    would be appropriate for the angled accents.\r\n\r\n<em>...the only way to set

    across a 1950s French setting of Bodoni the other day, and noticed that the acute

  body: "Well, to answer your questions, firstly I meant horizontal as in \"more horizontal...\".
    There are a few resons for this. Firstly, because of the space economy and the
    fact that nearly horizontal (or flatter, if you will) accents are easier to work
    with, especially for accented caps. You see, in French (from France), it is preferred
    to just leave the accents off caps. In Italian, the accent is replaced by an apostrophe
    after the letter (since the accents occur almost exclusively at the ends of words).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in Quebec usage, caps are supposed to be accented as well. Besides that, I just
    like the freedom of having as many options as possible.\r\n\r\nThe second reason
    for the horizontal accents is that it's much closer to the way accents are handwritten.
    I don't think I've ever seen handwriting or printing with accents like those of
    most typefaces, but rather they are usually quite horizontal and take up the full
    width of the letter. So, I personally find that this style of accent is more natural.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as your 1950s French Bodoni, Nick, I can understand the disctiction between
    the two (since they can be seen as two distinct symbols rather than mirror images
    of each other). \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing about accents is Italian. It makes
    frequent use of the grave accent (to signify stress), but the accent is often
    replaced by an apostrophe (a carryover from the days of typewriters I guess),
    or, the accent is sometimes written toward the right side of the letter:\r\n\r\nSi
    pu\xF2 dire \"un bambino\", quindi la forma maschile sar\xE0 tronca\r\nSi puo'
    [...] sara' tronca\r\nSi puo` [...] sara` tronca\r\n\r\nIn printed and handwritten
    texts the first two are both common (the second one because some people are just
    too lazy to bother finding accents on their keyboards). The last one is just a
    variation on the placement of the accent (probably because people in the old days
    were too lazy to go backwards on their typewriter to type the accent <cite>over</cite>
    the letter) and is only seen in handwriting. For the record, only the actual accented
    letter is \"correct\", not that anyone takes heed.\r\n\r\nIn an all-caps setting,
    both of these would be common:\r\n\r\nSI PUO' [...] SARA' TRONCA\r\n\r\nSI PU\xD2
    [\u2026] SAR\xC0 TRONCA\r\n\r\nWhy? Probably just because Italians have to do
    everything in the most complicated way possible. Variety is the spice of life,
    after all...\r\n\r\nAnyway, in my limited experience with accents (I only speak
    French, Italian, and Spanish, so I can only speak from those viewpoints), I have
    come to the conclusion that while, on the surface, it seems like all these languages
    use the exact same accents (because we give the same name to the same direction
    of accent), in fact the preference of shape varies from language to language and
    country to country. I guess in a perfect world we would have several choices of
    accents to use, so that Poles, Czechs, Quebecers, and Italians, and the many other
    users of diactrical marks could all be contented.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I need
    to create some tighly lead all-caps French for consuption in Quebec so... any
    suggestions?"

    of the limitations of typewriters. If you look at older French books, you will
    see the accents on caps. If you look at quality French typesetting such as practiced
    by the Imprimerie nationale, you will see the accents on caps.\r\n\r\nThe accents
    on caps are almost always flatter than on the lowercase letters (unless the font
    is specifically Polish), so I guess you are looking for <em>very</em> flat cap
    accents."
