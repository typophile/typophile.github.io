  that I wanted for a fun children's early chapter book (ages 6-10) written from a
  dog's point of view. However, my only concern is that it might be slightly too funky
  to be readable for a short chapter book. A very non-scientific study of a handful
  of first-graders showed that they can read it just fine, so maybe it's just my resistance
  to the tried-and-true Garamonds.\r\n\r\nI was also considering, as runner-ups, both
  Magellan and Adobe Caslon, though Buccardi is still hands-down my favorite for this
  project. Also, I'm thinking that with Buccardi, I could use it as well for the title,
  headings, etc., whereas the other two wouldn't cut it for a title font.\r\n\r\nI
  need a second (third, fourth...) opinion from folks who are even more experienced
  at this than I am. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I hadn't seen Buccardi before - pretty cool. Its proportions, color and spacing
    are good - and those are central to readability. And some funkiness in the letterforms
    might actually <em>help</em> readability! Go for it.\r\n\r\nBTW, for a titling
    companion I might recommend one of these:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-oneleigh/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/vendome-sh/bold/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks! I like your suggestions, particularly Vendome SH. I'll put that on
    the short list once I get the cover illustration from the artist and see how it
    fits together. Appreciate it!
