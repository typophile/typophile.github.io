    assumption is that typographers will understand that Smarty Pants' solution to
    a technically intractable problem requires user cooperation, and not use single
    quote marks for first-order quotations.\r\n\r\nSecond-order or nested quotes-within-quotes
    are an occurence much rarer than apostrophes at the start of words/numbers, so
    this is now the sacrificial lamb.\r\n\r\nIf we users were really smart, we would
    use some combination of guillemet-style quote marks to deal with second-level
    quotes -- as is the situation in several languages."
