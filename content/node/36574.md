body: "howdy from austin, tx... I'm having some trouble locating a typeface for a
  project. \r\n\r\ni'm usually very much a traditionalist when it comes to type selection,
  this project is requiring that i cast a wider net (hopefully someone here would
  be kind enough to offer their expertise).\r\n\r\nthe feeling the face needs to communicate
  is one of strength and speed. the closest thing i could find was the Propel drink
  logo (see here) http://www.dontgetlost.ca/raid/Propel%20logo.JPG\r\n\r\nits almost
  something like a sports team would have, i like the way the propel logotype utilizes
  subtle motion indicators without looking garish.\r\n\r\ni would be most appreciative
  of any help that could be offered. thank you."
