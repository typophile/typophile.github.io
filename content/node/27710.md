body: "How do letters written by a moving hand influence type design for the better
  and worse? The discussion over '[[chirography]]' in type has raged several times
  on Typophile. \r\n\r\nI recently encountered two interesting discussions relevant
  to this issue. First, '[[Printers Type in the Twentieth Century]]' by [[Richard
  Southall]] discusses the '[[Metafonts]]' of [[Donald Knuth]]. If I understand the
  account of the Metafonts correctly, a spine of the letter is defined as if a stylus
  were drawing a thin line. Then variations of width out from that thin line are used
  to define a font, giving varied weights and contrasts--something like multiple masters,
  only different. [Knuth's concept is somewhat different than the ideas of G. Noordzij,
  which appeared at about the same time.] \r\n\r\nAccording to the account this effort
  at 'chirographic' type didn't really work. The modifications in weights at joins
  and other optical corrections couldn't be programmed in any easy or natural way,
  and so the effort was never developed further. Instead, people went over to outline
  fonts. \r\n\r\nSo score one against chirography. \r\n\r\nMy other encounter was
  with the presentations of [[Mark Jamra]] at TypeCon. He gave a fascinating account
  of the teaching methods of the late [[Martin Andersch]], under whom he studied and
  whose methods he has adapted in his own type design and teaching. Andersch, inspired
  by [[Rudolph Koch]]'s late work, has the students start with 'expressionistic-interpretative
  writing'. For Jamra, this involves taking an unconventional tool, dipping it in
  ink, and drawing a word of 3-5 letters over and over for hours on reams of paper.
  He says that this induces a meditative, relaxed state in which the mind and body
  are able to get amazing, innovative results. These are then refined on the computer
  to produce a digital word. \r\n\r\nJamra has posted <a href=\"http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/education_extras/cranbrook_2004-10-00/\">examples</a>
  on his extensive <a href=\"http://typeculture.com/index.php\">web site</a>. His
  own typefaces, including [[Kinesis]] and [[Alphatier]] were inspired by this process.
  \r\n\r\nJamra's work seems to give opposite indications from Knuth's: the moving
  hand is indeed a valuable and creative \"underlying force\" in type design, as [[Jan
  van Krimpen]] put it. \r\n\r\n  "

  body: "I don't think you have to use quite so much paper to reach an intuitive state.\r\nAny
    hand skill benefits from a warm-up period (and that would include ball sports).\r\nThen
    the muscle memory kicks in and works fluidly.\r\nMuscle memory is pliant, too,
    affected by other things that happen to one physically.\r\nI haven't found it
    becomes forgetful, though, in writing--more so in music.\r\nAltered mental states
    will produce different results, and there are many ways to achieve that. Basically,
    just get out of your rut."
