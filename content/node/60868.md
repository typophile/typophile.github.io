  resource.\r\nAnd after reading several people here enjoy identifying fonts for fun,
  i figured i should have a go, i might be able to provide you with a challenge now
  and again :)\r\nRight now i'm looking to identify the font in the Tamiflu logo;\r\n\r\n[[http://tamiflu.co.nz/resources/img/tamiflu-logo.gif|Example
  here]]\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to find out if this is an existing font, or a variation
  perhaps.\r\nAny tips or pointers are most welcome, thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nGrtz,
  cad\r\n\r\n "

    italic</a> not using the fl ligature but the f and l in the character set.
