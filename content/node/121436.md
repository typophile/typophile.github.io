  of 17 inch long scales, which I suppose are for typographical measures. \r\nThere
  also is a long slit between scales, which I suppose is meant to cover a selected
  line of printed text.\r\nThe scales are from top to bottom:  1/6\", 1/12\", [slit],
  cm, 1/17\", 1/10\".\r\nI suppose the first two scales are used for Anglosaxon pica
  points.\r\nBut I am completely in the dark about the division in 1/17\" of inches.\r\nAs
  you will have read from my description, I am a complete layman on typophily.\r\nCan
  someone please explain the use of a scale divided in seventeenth parts of inches?\r\n\r\nOtto\r\n"

  body: "I wonder: 1/17th of an inch is 1/3th of a cicero, or 4 didot points, within
    an accuracy of 3%.\r\n\r\nThat could merely be a coincidinky though."

  body: "1/17th, or .0588, is also the size of a tap drill used by machinists. I cannot
    visualize a machinist using a rule of this type though; it seems more oriented
    to the graphic arts.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] I spoke too quickly. I found that it is a forms
    ruler such as those available from gaebel.com\r\n\r\nhere ==> [[http://gaebel.com/Transp.htm

  body: While the description on the Gabel page says "inches in 17ths", visible on
    the photograph of the ruler are only inches in 16ths, so that is apparently a
    misprint.

  body: Is it possible that printers had some use for 1/17" measurements in the past?

    name: George Thomas
  body: "After more research, I still believe it is likely a forms ruler, possibly
    intended for use by programmers. I came to this conclusion because older dot-matrix
    printers and some modern printers have the ability to print at 17 cpi. All the
    other measurements, possibly including the metric one, would be useful for the
    same reason because they are all standard cpi measurements. I think the ruler
    shown in the image may be fairly old and possibly was a proprietary ruler.\r\n\r\nThe
    following list is from a Panasonic printer setup manual which shows all of its
    various cpi capabilities.\r\nPica (10 cpi): 80 cpl\r\nElite (12 cpi): 96 cpl\r\nMicron
    (15 cpi): 120 cpl\r\nCompressed (17 cpi): 137 cpl\r\nElite compressed (20 cpi):
    160 cpl\r\nPica elongated (5 cpi): 40 cpl\r\nElite elongated (6 cpi): 48 cpl\r\nMicron
    elongated (7.5 cpi): 60 cpl\r\nCompressed elongated (8.5 cpi): 68 cpl\r\nElite
    compressed elongated (10 cpi): 80 cpl\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a better idea that
    involves 17-to-the-inch measurements I think we would all love to hear about it.\r\n"

  body: George, you may very well be right about that. I take it that 17cpi resulted
    more from a technical point of view rather than by design? As the number of dots
    per inch is constant,  so one can only vary the width of characters in <em>pixels</em>
    (pins, on a dot matrix printer), and then simply count how many go in an inch.

  body: "Many thanks to George Thomas for his answer and solution to my problem.\r\nIndeed
    this must be the solution, if the ruler is intended to count non-proportional
    spaced letters on a line of text.\r\nI had completely forgotten that dot-matric
    printers ever existed, and indeed they had letter sizes of 10, 12, 15, 17 etc
    cpi, all of which can be used by the scales of my ruler.\r\nThanks again, and
    apologies that I put up a problem not really related to typophiles: proportional
    spacing, bah.\r\n\r\nOtto\r\n"
