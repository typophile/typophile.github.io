  for simple and eye-catching.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psluv2_6509.jpg]"

  body: "It's pretty hard to read, but P.SLUV is pretty hard to read to begin with.
    \ Is it supposed to be pronounced like peace-love?  What's with the period in
    the middle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The musician is using P.Sluv as a pseudonym which is, yes, also a wordplay
    on "Peace Love". Thanks for the quick feedback.

  body: Thanks, I noticed that too. I'll make that small change in the next revision.
    Does the third one (by itself) look interesting do you think? And most importantly,
    does it look "electronica"?

  body: "The first thing that jumps out at me is that the period seems to be awkwardly
    spaced. You've got relatively the same sliver separating all the letters, except
    that the P and the period have a large gap between them and there's a little too
    much space between the P and S. Perhaps you could move the P to the right, extend
    the tail of the S, and move the period to the left so there's a more consistent
    snugness throughout.\r\n\r\nLooking at the amount of negative space surrounding
    your text, when enclosed in the rectangle, you'll notice that there's more breathing
    room on the top and right side than there is on the bottom and left side. In particular,
    the lower left corner around the P seems cramped. I would expand the space below
    the L to match the space above it and do something similar with the the space
    to the left of the P. \r\n\r\nI'd also suggest looking at some other typefaces
    options for THE and MOVEMENT. What you've got now seems very generic and there's
    potential for you to add some interest through contrast or make it more cohesive
    by continuing the same style. To add contrast, I would look for something very
    blocky, grid-like, or rectangular. To go the other direction, I would try something
    very round and geometric, like the main logo type. You could also try going lighter
    or heavier with the weight.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you're mechanically aligning
    the T of THE and M of MOVEMENT right now. You might also consider optically aligning
    it by shift THE a little to the left. It's also a bit ambiguous as to whether
    you're trying to line up M with the P or the colored rectangle. It might depend
    on what typeface you ultimately choose, but I would also experiment with aligning
    it in those other ways and see which grid system you like best.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I'd say that it fits well with the electronica vibe, while giving you a friendly
    retro hint which I think reinforces the underlying peace/love idea."
