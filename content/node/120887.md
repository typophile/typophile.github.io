  ease of reference, here is A to W, in a digital interpretation I  did based on the
  letters in the Klingspor pdf.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FloridaHansM\xF6hringWilhelmWoellmer1932SM_3734.jpg]\r\nNote
  the  asymmetrical stroke weight in _O_, _B_, _D_, _P_, and _R_.\r\nI was wondering
  if there was a lower case and other characters and what they might look like.\r\nThe
  foundry might have been Wilhelm Woellmer.\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"

    (linked in this font ID thread: http://typophile.com/node/120614).\r\nNot exactly
    sharp, but at least the shapes, contrast and proportions are visible.\r\nAlso
    some awkward so-tight-they-look-like-stubs umlauts.\r\nI think this is a caps-only
    design. Moreover, the position of diereses and the retracted |Q|'s tail make me
    think it was designed as a titling typeface intended to take up any ascender and
    descender space available."

    Peignot\u201D to me, thus less modern.\r\nIn any case, I don\u2019t think the
    pointed terminals (on |M|, |N|, etc.) belong to the original design. Also, judging
    by the version used for the DVD cover,* indubitably lifted directly from the film,
    the |N|\u2019s thin stems appear to be a bit tapered. It could be an artefact
    of photo reproduction, but I think they harmonise nicely with |E|, |T|, etc.\r\nSorry
    to not adding any valuable historical information.\r\n\r\n* http://www.criterion.com/films/28491-persona

  body: 'Yup, thought about that too. There''s some fascinating almost imperceptible
    tapering going on here and then that could be reinserted in an interesting way.
    Left leg of the A, for instance, and in K+V+W. Also tapered terminals on S, J,
    G and C. Is your thinning of the lower bowl of B intentional?  '

  body: "Ye, I can see that a recreation would:\r\n1. Loose the points\r\n2. Probably,
    taper thin strokes, like _N_ and perhaps elsewhere. This was not obvious from
    the small scale letters in the Klingspor pdf, but could be there.\r\nI'm not certain
    about the bulbous ends. The letters in the Klingspor pdf don't seem to have them.
    I know from previous research of Criterion covers that they sometimes rework fonts
    substantially.\r\nAs for the sharper look of this digitization, it might look
    more Art Deco than my scan but the thickness and alignment of the clean digital
    strokes follows the scan very closely, with the exception of the the tapered thin
    strokes of _N_ which I probably incorrectly interpreted as a printing effect rather
    than a design feature.\r\nAs for  subtlety and warmth, I see a hard edge Art Deco
    design of 1932 in the  letters in the Klingspor pdf with variations being mainly
    the result of the printing and scanning process. \r\nThis issue could be clarified
    by a better specimen.\r\nStill would love to know if there is a lower case and
    other characters.\r\nBTW I agree with the similar to Peignot observation. This
    is a design of that era.\r\nDon"

    for possible tapering in lhs of _A_, and _K_, _V_ and _W_ I do believe you are
    right. Will adjust.\r\nThe clean digital does taper the terminals on _S_, _J_,
    _G_ and _C_. But I made them taper to thin rather than to thicker. Will adjust.\r\nStill
    nothing on the a better specimen or  a lower case and other characters?\r\nDon"

    a LC that matches. I am tending towards a double decker _a_ and a single story
