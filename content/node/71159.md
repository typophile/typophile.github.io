body: "Hello fellow typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am having a problem embedding chinese fonts
  on PDF to print and view. This topic has been discussed before on http://typophile.com/node/59688,
  but I have hit another roadblock and would like to ask if anyone with the same problem
  found a solution.\r\n\r\nI designed a magazine (260+ pages) on InDesign CS3 on a
  Mac running OS 10.4 in mandarin, using the native mac font STHeiti. When it was
  time to send the piece to the printers, I discovered that the font was blocked and
  could not be embedded on a PDF.\r\n\r\nIn the above mentioned post, I discovered
  that Adobe has a font (Adobe Heiti) which is identical to STHeiti and can de embedded.
  But then ran into another problem. In the publication (remember, 260+ pages) I used
  STHeiti <i>Light</i> and the Adobe mentioned font - at least the one I have in my
  system which came from my CS3 package - only has a <i>Regular</i> set.\r\n\r\nThis
  slight change will force me to redesign most pages, since they are mostly running
  text.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that in Snow Leopard, Apple has changed the native chinese
  font to a similar Heiti family. Therefore STHeiti no longer exists in the system.\r\n\r\nI
  have 3 questions I hope you can help me with:\r\n\r\n1- Do you know of any system
  upgrades that could allow access to STHeiti Light in a format that can be embbeded?\r\n\r\n2-
  Do you know if Adobe Heiti exists as a <i>Light</i> font and where I can get it?\r\n\r\n3-
  (And this is not really related) How do I substitute STHeiti for Adobe Heiti in
  50 separate InDesign documents at once?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGabriel Attuy"
