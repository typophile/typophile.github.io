body: "Hi, I thought this might already be on here, since its fairly old news, but
  found nothing on the search so:\r\n\r\nI would like to find out what the serif font
  is in the new(ish) Bloomberg Businessweek design. The sans I believe is the Haas
  Grotesk by Schwartzco Inc. (http://christianschwartz.com/haasgrotesk.shtml), but
  I can't figure out the text font. I feel a little stupid because I'm sure this has
  been talked about, but google gave me nothing.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGabriel\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/businessfont2_6465.png]"
