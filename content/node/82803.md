  substitute in its place?

    follow why Futura is \"naturally\" the \"sans-serif go-to guy.\""

    me, Futura and Memphis are *too* similar to effectively mix. Memphis is more or
    less \"Futura with slabs,\" except that it's not a perfect match, so the little
    differences throw it straight into the uncanny valley of type matching."

    part is subjective, and so might the \"read\" part be.\r\nIt's just a question
    of stylistic preference.\r\nUp until about five years ago, slab serif types had
    been rarely used since the 1940s, no doubt because people thought they didn't
    look and read too well. The came the Clarendon revival, and a colonization of
    the slab genre by contemporary type designers.\r\n\r\nI've always found it useful
    to match faces and styles from the same era (unless going for a pointed contrast).\r\nHowever,
    Neuzeit Grotesk, from the mid 60s, is probably what you're looking for. It's classic,
    vintage, with less of a harshly geometric quality than Futura or Avant Garde,
    and without the compromise of a two-storey a."

    back.\r\nThis observation is based both on my career as an art director (for 25
    years slabs hardly ever seemed an appropriate choice), and on my knowledge of
    the history of mass media typography (few other ADs spec'd them either).\r\nEven
    perusing type specimen books of the second half of the 20th century (not always
    a clear guide to what was popular), it is apparent how pass\xE9 slabs became\u2014with
    the odd exception such as Lubalin Graph (\"Avant Garde Slab\")\u2014because very
    few new slabs were published.\r\n\r\nThe observation that art directors extrapolate
    what they think looks good to assuming it reads well for the target audience is
    something I would have thought you would have concurred with me on.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026too
    simplistic\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nRight. That's why I recommended Neuzeit Grotesk,
    not Century Gothic.\r\nCompared with the reductive \"f\", \"j\" and \"t\" of Futura,
    NG has the usual fully-formed versions of these glyphs, plus friendly round tittles."

    a characteristic of the Modernist movement, especially for design, that its practitioners
    believed design had a social responsibility\u2014isn't that how you view type
    design?\r\nThey felt that decoration was bourgeois frippery, an unnecessary embellishment
    to the function of design\u2014isn't this how you view display type?\r\nSo in
    the name of functionalism they removed the seemingly decorative serifs from type\u2014but
    took it too far, to the extent that types such as Futura are not the most legible
    or functional. That's the irony of modernism, intent subverted by execution.\r\n\r\nYour
    belief (if I understand it correctly) that there are certain letter forms which
    are fundamentally more readable/legible to human physiology is modernist. Isn't
    that functionalist and mechanistic, and not too far from seeing the process of
    reading as OCR decoding?\r\n\r\nThe idea which you castigate, \"That which we
    read more often we read best\" is Post-modern\u2014because it situates readability
    as culturally specific and admits to multiple subjective viewpoints and values.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that you are a modernist in principle, but have issues with the historically
    reductive, minimalist style of modernism. \r\nAre you a neo-modernist?"

    -or any individual- is useful. To me Modernism is inherently escapist - it denies
    the complexities, the inherent lack of control in human existence. On the other
    hand although Post-Modernism can make sense to me most individuals who associate
    themselves with it are escapist - many of them strike me as artists who do design
    only because they want to make decent money; it's almost like Post-Modernism is
    a sanctuary for those who don't have the mettle for Modernism. If a person does
    not enjoy figuring out readability for example, he's quite likely to also not
    have the mettle to admit it, too often he'd rather simply state it's not important.
