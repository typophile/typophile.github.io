body: "I posted Albuquerque here a long time ago, but it's changed a great deal since
  then. A lot of the missing serifs have been put back, and some of the weak looking
  corners that were rounded off have been re-squared. /C/ and /G/, which were problem
  characters from the beginning were redone from scratch and I think look much better,
  though not perfect. I also went through Karen Cheng's Designing Type, fixing some
  of the oddities and optically correcting some things.\r\n\r\nI've started hammering
  out the metrics in FontLab, but I don't have the full version, so I can't really
  use what I've done until I buy that...\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's what it looks like
  now:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/r11_5505.jpg]\r\n\r\npdf is attached."

  body: "Here's more with the new /C/ and /G/...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/r11_CG_5752.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
    the /G/ in particular that I'm still not sure about."

  body: The q is the one that's off for me.  Given its name, I'd expect the q's spur
    to be a lot lower (sub-baseline) not unlike Spanish handwriting. What would the
    g look like if the connector between the two bowls were curved into the lower
    bowl (kind of like the e).

  body: "Nice design. I like the /g/. The /q/ is also quite cool though it might be
    creating too much texture in the vertical center of the lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    tittle on /i/ should be a little higher. Also, are your round characters slightly
    taller so they look optically the same height as square characters? I'm not 100%
    certain but the rounded characters seem to look optically slightly smaller.\r\n\r\nI
    think if you want to give /P/ and /R/ such large bowls then the horizontal bar
    in /A/ should be a bit lower so the counter becomes larger.\r\n\r\nYou might want
    to extend the horizontal stroke in /G/ to the height of the horizontal bar in
    /B/ or just a bit below that. I suspect that should fix your issue with /G/.\r\n\r\n/T/
    could be a little wider."

  body: "Great suggestions.\r\n\r\n@guifa, I'm not familiar with Spanish handwriting,
    but it would be highly unusual for the spur of a /q/ to be below the baseline\u2014not
    that my /q/ isn't unusual now, of course. I would be interested in seeing an example
    of this, if you can find one, though.\r\n\r\nAs for the link of the /g/, you're
    just suggesting that it curve smoothly rather than being so angular, right? I
    don't really get the connection with /e/, though. I'll tinker...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Martin,
    The lowercase texture issue is one I hadn't thought of, but adjustment will probably
    have to wait until I can do testing on blocks of text.\r\n\r\nYou're definitely
    right about the tittle and the /T/, though. The round characters are optically
    adjusted, but I think you're right that they should be pushed a bit further.\r\n\r\nGood
    call on adjusting the /A/'s crossbar.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PAR_6187.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    bumped the /G/'s bar up a bit. The /B/E/ crossbar height was too high, but it
    does little better now, I think...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GRAB_4101.jpg]"
