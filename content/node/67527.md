  body: "Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be anything I have cataloged in my Script
    Guide, and it was not from any of the sources I would usually look at for similar
    styles. The most similar font I found was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/argenta/|Argenta]]
    from Sudtipos.\r\n\r\nThis is a hand-printed script style, and though it does
    look like it was done by someone with lettering skill, there are too many possible
    sources for me to locate it. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    time I see this font used on ads, or (in this case) published online on my country.\r\nI'm
    sure it is a commercial font.\r\nI wonder what font it is.\r\nI'm almost sure
    I have seen it somewere in a foundry website..."

  body: "Reading the comments on that font I found out the designer is someone named
    Anja Denali. Normally, when I don't see a designer credited at Dafont, I become
    suspicious about the font origin. However, this seems to be legitimate, and very
    nicely done at that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
