  website!\r\n\r\nI am working on the branding of a large website start-up company
  dealing with World History. Essentially it will be an on-line encyclopaedia or research
  tool. The criteria for font selection is as follows:\r\n\r\nWidely available across
  current platforms (a core font)\r\nFont should be serif and not modern looking\r\nBoth
  print and screen use\r\nFree - no licence required\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the choice
  I have suggested is Georgia which works great on screen but no good with print.\r\n\r\nI
  would much appreciate your suggestions \u2013 thanks in advance."

  body: 'Thanks for your reply dberlow. Georgia is fine for all their screen publications
    but there will be plenty of print stuff such as business cards, letterheads and
    brochures. They want to have a strong brand and were hoping to use the same or
    similar font across all their material. Which out of the serif fonts available
    on Mac and PCs would work well as a print font to go with Georgia? Also to complicate
    matters there will be some limited need of a sans serif face so any suggestions
    would be welcomed. '

    it's not a big deal to have Georgia online and something else in print.\r\n\r\nYou
    can't ever count on a specific text face online anyways.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Limiting yourself to web-safe typefaces for all areas of branding is not
    a good idea IMHO. The web is very limited in the way of type, and people are used
    to it. If you go with Georgia on the website and a different font for print (or
    header images, etc.) you shouldn't run into any problems.\r\n\r\nThe one point
    that concerns me is the fourth one. If it has to be free or a system font, then
    you're pretty much stuck with Georgia or TNR.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Thank you so much for all your feedback. I have tried to explain to the client
    the limitations of using only web safe fonts but as they want to edit and publish
    a lot of their print materials themselves, they have said they do not want to
    purchase any font licenses. I think it will probably end up being Georgia for
    screen and print - shame as the typography will suffer. Thanks again everyone.

    due to it''s rather high x-height. It still looks years better than the overused

    it's my standard font for non-personal letters, and it has never appeared anything
    other than beautiful to me.

    dont shot me for this) arial for screen and then concentrate on pushing the print
    using logo and colour use!\r\n\r\nif you spend all day trying to make people use
    georgia on screen you'll be putting your self into alot of trouble unless you
    use it on a non html website! or rendered jpegs..."
