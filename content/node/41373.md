  http://www.officepdx.com/index.php. I ordered the portfolio cover wrong; it was
  a little confusing. They not only checked my order for accuracy, which I thought
  was fantastic, they also called me to tell me about the problem. They had already
  corrected it and were shipping the order. \r\n\r\nI think this is fantastic customer
  service.\r\n\r\nSharon"
