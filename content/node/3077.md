  body: Californian FB would be a definite step up from Berkley, while similar enough
    to keep your mag&#39;s look. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s been carefully developed by Font
    Bureau for magazines, and has lots of different cuts for you to play with. <BR>
    <BR>I haven&#39;t tried it, but Benton Sans seems like it would work. <BR> <BR>You

    One would think they would follow slavishly the original. They were a customer
    of both Goudy and Lanston. They had us &#40;before my time&#41; cut 24 pt. Hadriano
    for Monotype Composition. The source for our Digital Hadriano came from that cutting.

    <BR><i>Freight train pt. size for Monotype Composition.</i> Very rare. They were
    tired of hand-setting names on diplomas. <BR> <BR>Revivals are like Scotch, best

  body: 'Berkeley Old Style is soother and less mannered than Goudy&#39;s original
    and the Font Bureau version, which is closer to the original. &#40;Bringhurst
    compares the two in his &#39;Elements&#39;&#41;. I think Berkeley Old Style is
    very well done, and in being less mannered may be of wider usability than the
    original. It really depdends on how mannered you want the look of your magazine
    to be.  <BR> <BR>When I tried FB Californian on my laser printer, I found the
    spacing &#40;or something&#41; a bit odd, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just
    my set-up. '

    though it might not be a problem, depending on the nature of the publication.
    Meta is, as Bringhurst points out, a modern version of Goudy Sans, and might work
    well with any of the versions of Californian.  '

  body: I am amazed at how quickly this many messages accumulated.  <BR> <BR>Thank
    you so much for all your input. I agree with many of the points made here. I find
    the Berkley more mild mannered than the Californian as well. Californian is very
    beautiful though and I would love to use it. <BR> <BR>However, the other quite
    dominant font in the magazine &#40;though for select display size purposes&#41;
    is a Didot, so I also have to consider what will work with that. I find I like
    the Meta but don&#39;t have a condensed form, if there is one.  Benton Sans seems
    to give me lots of options, but it may not be much of a departure from Helvetica
    Neue. What do you think? <BR> <BR>What is hardest for me is that I want to bring
    a different feel to the publication but I can&#39;t be radical. Berkeley is viewed
    favorably, text fit and size work well as it is,  and the rest sort of needs to
    harmonize.  <BR> <BR>Sometimes it is is easier to throw everything out and start
    from scratch, grid and all, but unfortunately I am challenged with small changes.  It
    is difficult though to make font decisions when you don&#39;t have them yet to
    try out the changes, so all this is very insightful in making my choices. <BR>
    <BR>The Goudy Sans again doesn&#39;t have a condensed which is very helpful in
    small column copy, which we do have as well. <BR> <BR>Thanks, Vern

  body: 'There is a Meta condensed, though it is already on the narrow side to start
    with, like Goudy Sans. Benton regular is also in inherently narrower form than
    Helvetica, which is why I think it sets better, when at any length. Also Myriad
    Condensed is nice, and with its softness would probably go with Berkeley, if you
    stick with that. I don&#39;t see how Didot, which is wide like Helvetica, is a
    good match for the Goudy faces, but I am not looking at it, so I may be way off
    base.  <BR> '

- author:
    name: vern9ine
  body: William, <BR>just to clarify, Didot is used mainly for large dept heads and
    in the masthead, Berkley is main body text, and the Sans Serif is used throughout
    for various other tasks such as subheads, lists, captions, running heads, dept
    heads, etc... the various widths from one family come in very handy for that because
    it gives me enough variety to offer distinctive looks without using another font.

    name: jim_rimmer
  body: Vern <BR> <BR>I mentioned The Alphabet in a post about ten days ago, in response
    to a thread about books on type design. The Alphabet and elements of Lettering
    were produced very close together. I have elements in front of me, so I can tell
    you the date was 1922. I believe that elements of Lettering was around 1911 or
    1912. The publisher is Mitchell Kennerley. Both titles were printed by Marchbanks
    Press. <BR> <BR>I also have a copy of The Alphabet, but it&#39;s buried somewhere
    in the printshop. <BR> <BR>Both books have been composed by Fred and Bertha Goudy
    in 18 point Kennerley No 1. The other 18 point made was later with long descenders,
    designated as No 2. <BR> <BR>I have read that Goudy named the type for Mitchell
    Kennerley, with the agreement that Kennerley would pay to have the matrices engraved
    and supplied to Goudy for his further use at his foundry. <BR> <BR>A little more
    than a dozen years ago, Dover published the two titles as one book in perfect
    bound format. It shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to find a copy. <BR> <BR>Both
    books are slim volumes, topping out at 48 pages or so. I found it amusing and
    human that in the final six pages or so of The Alphabet, goudy apparently ran
    out of letters in the cases of Kennerley, and these pages are peppered with wrong
    fonts &#40;p&#39;s and H&#39;s I think&#41;. I believe he substituted with Garamont
    or Kennerley No 2. It&#39;s been along time since I have come across this book,
    so I can&#39;t recall. Of all the things Goudy detractors could have latched onto
    this is one that I have never noticed him being taken to task for. <BR> <BR>Personally
    I find the imperfection charming and completely understandable. I can imagine
    that he was under pressure to supply the pages of type to the printer and  had
    no time to turn on the caster pot to make the necessary sorts. <BR> <BR>Anyone
    have a theory? <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: 'Since this thread is primarily concerned with &#34;Californian&#34;, I thought
    I would mention, if it has not already been done, that Goudy&#39;s &#34;Typologia&#34;
    is a master work worth reading. <BR> <BR>It was written by him as a kind of magnum
    opus on his method of cutting type, and at the same time concerned with how he
    went about designing the face for the University. Goudy went through a lot of
    discussion with the institution, wherein he wished to name the type simply &#34;University
    Oldstyle&#34;. The director of the Press thought the name to be too generic, so
    they settled on &#34;University of California Oldstyle. It was a bit of a mouthful,
    but the school wanted to have their name on it. Lanston Monotype did the production
    work on the type, making matrices for the use of the University. Some years later
    the type was licensed to Lanston, and they sold it under the name &#34;Californian&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>The patterns that Gerald Giampa has in his possession are of the lead &#34;boilerplate&#34;
    type, devised by Goudy, and were made by Goudy himself at Deepdene. These are
    the only full suite of patterns to survive the fire at Deepdene, simply because
    they were in use by lanston at the time of the fire. <BR> <BR>The book is well
    worth having for more than one good reason. It shows Goudy&#39;s approach to a
    design, his method of rendering the design in metal, and his philosophy of type
    and design. <BR> <BR>There are more than one page of large showings of the type.
    All-round this book has a lot to tell the new OR experienced designer, in that
    it gives an instance where a design is a surprising disappointment. <BR> <BR>Speaking
    of disappointments: I lent my signed original copy to a journalist &#40;didn&#39;t
    really know him&#41; about 15 years ago, and haven&#39;t seen the bugger or the
    book since. Goodbye to a fine book and $300. Oh well . . . <BR> <BR>Jim '
