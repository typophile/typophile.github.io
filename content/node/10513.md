  messageboard for the first time and have religiously lurked here since. It&#39;s
  a satisfying feeling to know that I&#39;m not alone; to have proof that there are
  other like-minded individuals.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve finally a situation that begs
  for your expertise. As best I can, I&#39;ve searched archives; my fear is that this
  topic has been covered, but I&#39;ll ask anyway. Any steadfast advice would be appreciated.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on an annual report, laden with consecutive uppercase letters
  and numbers, which greatly interfere with a regular color and texture of the text
  that I&#39;d like to maintain throughout. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working with Adobe Garamond.
  <BR> <BR>Following is just one sample paragraph: <BR> <BR>SCCVB actively pursued
  sales leads from companies and organizations such as Deloitte &amp; Touche, Nortel,
  AMCAA, 2005 Workplace Summit, British Elle, Zeta Direct, 2005 NBC World Series,
  Retailers Choice, ROMBS Program, Whole House, Intel/American Express, BBC America,
  AH1 Meeting Services, Jamaican Tourist Board, Utopia, NVIDIA Product Launch, E4events
  Medical Professionals Conference, NPR, GQ and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The director
  of sales conducted presentations and sales meetings with BMG, NewLine Cinema, HBO,
  Tzell Travel, Sony, RCA and  MTV. <BR> <BR>As a teacher of typography, I encourage
  my students, when appropriate, to use oldstyle figures and small caps in text. This
  certainly appears to be an appropriate situation, but there are so many variables
  that there seems to be no correct answer. <BR> <BR>&#34;SSCVB&#34; is my client.
  When beginning a sentence &#40;or paragraph&#41;, should the first &#34;S&#34; be
  a regular cap? It would look awkward to begin such a phrase with an x-height character.
  What if the second appearance of SSCVB falls mid-sentence?  <BR> <BR> &#34;Nortel,
  AMCAA, 2005 Workplace,&#34; <BR>In a linear list, should AMCAA be all small caps
  or should the first letter, &#34;A,&#34; be a regular cap with the rest small? Clearly,
  2005 would be set in oldstyle figures. Or would it? <BR> <BR>&#34;2005 NBC World
  Series&#34; <BR>&#34;ROMBS Program&#34; <BR>&#34;BBC America&#34; <BR>&#34;AH1 Meeting
  Services&#34; <BR>&#34;Utopia, NVIDIA Product&#34; <BR>&#34;Launch, E4events Medical&#34;
  <BR>&#34;Conference, NPR, GQ and Cystic&#34; <BR> <BR>You get the picture? <BR>I&#39;m
  losing sleep.'

  body: I would not mind if SCCVB were all small caps even at the beginning <BR>of
    a sentence. Start with a versal, and it wouldn&#39;t be an acrynom  <BR>any more.
    Same for AMCAA, ROMBS, &amp;c. <BR>But you are right, most small caps are too
    small for all small caps. <BR> <BR>Have you tried a character style with all small
    caps aplied, and <BR>enlarging type size a little? &#40;Not too much, else small
    caps will <BR>look medium or bold.&#41; <BR> <BR>Karsten

  body: There&#39;s also a philsophical question here. Shouldn&#39;t text be set in
    the type it deserves? With the example paragraph, there is not much room for greatness.
    It seems to me fine just the way it is. Small caps and OSF will probably just
    make it more confusing to read. And suppose that every paragraph were like that?
    The designer would have to be getting a lot of money to make it worthwhile to
    try to spiff it up. In any case, in all design, function must come before aesthetics.
    Or rather, the aesthetics are dictated by the functional task. This seems to me
    the kind of text that should not be burdened with any aesthetic surprises. It&#39;s
    a great example of a common problem.

  body: Clinton, <BR> <BR>I was just about to post the same question. I&#39;m working
    on a Non-profit&#39;s newsletter that has the same issues as yours. <BR> <BR>In
    my opinion, small caps have become more of an aesthetic thing than anything else.
    There may be some increase in legibility, but I think most people have become
    accustomed to seeing all caps for acronyms.  <BR> <BR>If youre completely unsure
    of what is correct, than you have two options. Set the type in what looks best
    to you, purely on aethetic &#40;and possibly legibility&#41; standards. Or you
    can leave it up to the client. Provide them with a couple of examples and let
    them decide. Obviously, you might get scary results from the second choice, but
    you will also get a pretty straightforward answer that the client will be happy
    with regardless. <BR> <BR>In my own dilemma, I&#39;m stuck between the all small
    caps and the opening regular cap/small cap rest of the acronym. I&#39;m leaning
    toward the second, only because acronyms are obviously acronyms &#40;becuase usually
    they make no sense&#41; and that looks the most pleasing to me visually. I like
    calling it out with the regular cap because it is important enough to be capitalized,
    but I dont believe it is important enough to stick out like a sore thumb.

  body: How about a typeface where the caps are closer to the x-height? eg Quadraat,
    Cartier, Pontifex.

  body: "I have seen no commentary on one part of the original question having to
    do with instances where (in running text) a named entity includes figures as part
    of the name. The original examples given were \"2005 NBC World Series\" and \"AH1
    Meeting Services\". In both of these cases I would be inclined to use lining figures
    (as well as disinclined to use small-caps for the acronyms). Another example might
    be \"I am going to the 78th Academy Awards next year.\". Here I would also be
    inclined use lining figures rather than non-lining.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"
