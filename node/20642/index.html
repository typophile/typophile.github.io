  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm new to type design but not typography. I'm a designer based in the UK and have always wanted to design a typeface. My first effort is for my company Distil hence Distil Sans. So far I've only done the light version and the lowercase letters using a combination of Iluustrator CS2 and Fontlab Studio 4.6. The other weights are mocked up using a stroke in illustrator but are close to  what I would like the finished weights to be.

I'd be grateful for any feedback at this point

Just finishing the other letterforms and adding some more weights, then I'll get the holding page changed. Cheers for the reminder. Then move on to designing the site itself! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not a type designer, but rather a typographer/graphic
designer, but I will try and help you out.

I'm not too sure about the dark areas either. Although I think 
it does work in certain letters such as 'u' 'q' 'y' and 'g'. For me 
it definately doesn't work in 'm' 'k' 'e' 'a' 'r' and 'h'. Try and 
think where such clotting might occur more naturally within 
the letters, as it does seem over forced.

I don't like the shape of the 'w', 'x' or 'k'.  Perhaps look at more 
conventional shapes. It seems like you're trying too hard to 
make it stand out and seem original, probably because it's your 
first design. Don't be scared of really nice, but simple letters. I 
think that a lot of peoples first type designs are quite gimmicky. 

The bar on the 't' and 'f' needs to be stronger I feel. 

The 'z' looks like it's leaning to the right. Perhaps extend he 
baseline stroke to the right a little to balance it out more. 

The 's' looks upside down. 

The 'a' doesn't look right. Perhaps avoid the completely flat base. 
The bowl also seems a little small and squashed vertically.

The 'e' looks a little awkward to me. Try extending the bottom 
stroke and making that left side more curved. 

A good start though, and good luck!

		<div class="commentbody">Hi
Nice first font, I like some of it and agree with the other critics on many points.

One more thing though:
The arm on the 'r' is way too long, it looks too much like a cropped 'n'. 

Good luck with the font

		<div class="commentbody">RE: cropped ‘n’

Totally. 

I would loose those dark spots. They mess with the flow of the face & I don't think they are fun enough as is to keep.

Think about that e again. It should feel more different from your a - maybe grab a curce from the upper left side of your o.

For this face to look even it can't be litterally even. There are illusions at work. The problem becomes more & more obvious as the weight gets heavier. See it? If you do some searching on the web you will find references as to the why & how of this.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the posts. As I'm completely new to type design its good to get feedback! I agree about the r and need to tweak the a and e. I'm working on the other weights and discovering themes and shapes which I may work back into the lighter weight. I hope you understand what I mean. The face is still work in progress.

I was going to buy the book Designing Type by, I think its Carol Chan? Are there any other good books or websites which can help me with the basics?
