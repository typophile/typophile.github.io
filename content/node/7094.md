  body: As far as I can remember the only time I saw this font was in  <BR>a typography/design
    book. It was listed as a student&#39;s work  <BR>&#40;I think CalArts&#41;, not
    available to the general public. <BR> <BR>I still have to find that book yet.
    Sorry I can&#39;t help you any  <BR>better.

    you ever hear or see anything about it. If you do, I would appreciate you letting
    me know. <BR> <BR>bbg

    reveals</a> a Michael Worthington of CalArts as the <BR>1994 designer of Kookoo

    target="_blank"> Mr. Worthington</a> <BR>on its current staff. Hopefully, Devroye&#39;s
    e-mail contact address <BR>is still valid. If not, perhaps I&#39;ve gotten you
    a bit closer? ... <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
