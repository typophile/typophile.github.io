  body: I don't know, Nick. If I saw a pizza joint with well-design flyers set in
    BG, I'd assume it's a very hip place. Who knows how their pies would be, but I'd
    be inclined to find out.

    of such an exhaustive list? Just to be sure, if a font is only good at 3 things,
    should we say "almost everything" or will a slighty shorter list still be too
