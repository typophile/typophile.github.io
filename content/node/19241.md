body: "I was wondering how much work should be expected of a graphic artist in a day..
  Is it unreasonable to have approx 20 files to prepare for email... i.e. outline
  fonts and size images and to recreate (Match Font.. completely redraw logo/design)
  approximatly 3 logos and do 3 to 5 complete layouts in a day.. Layouts = Typesetting
  with logos revisions.. \r\n\r\nThis week so far = 100 ai files... Created.. everything
  from logo sizing to logo recreation...\r\n83 outgoing emails\r\n72 incoming emails\r\n39
  photoshop files.. remove backgrounds .. change shirt colors add logos and generally
  cleanup..\r\nTake pictures of items for webpages etc...\r\n\r\nCreated 72 pdf proof
  files...\r\n\r\nThis is so far this week...\r\n\r\nIs this too much for too little..
  under $14 an hour?  Is this unreasonable at any pay? or am I whining?????"

  body: You're whining. I got into this business 8 years ago as an Assistant Art Director
    at a magazine. I worked 60+ hours/week for $50/day. After 7 years of not whining,
    I became a Creative Director who works 60+ hours/week. I also receive about 150-200
    emails every day. Bust a** until you're good enough to get a better job where
    you will still work long hours on insane deadlines, but the work will be more
    exploratory and you'll make a little more money. You'll find that in time, you'll
    develop a much greater stress threshold. Maybe I'm a sadist, but if you're passionate
    about design, paying your dues should be a source of pleasure. Good luck.

  body: "Dennis,\r\n\r\nI would say that the quantity of work you describe is definitely
    not to be sniffed at. If you feel you are working to your maximum capacity and
    the workload is still growing then don't keep flogging yourself until you burn
    out. Standing up for yourself is not \"whining\" and there are always better paid
    positions to be had elsewhere if you are unhappy.\r\n\r\nNaturally when designers
    look back on their lean years, the rose tinted spectacles come out \u2013 however,
    there is a difference between the romantic notion of paying one's dues, and selling
    yourself short. In an industry where you are expected to be unquestioningly grateful
    for even having a paid position when design firms can exploit an endless number
    of people who will do work placements/internships for no money, it helps no-one
    to instill low expectations. The only result is a gradual devaluing of the designer.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck"

  body: "Are you working full-time or freelance? If fulltime, what are your hours?
    If the workload you described above can be completed in a 35-40 hour week you
    have nothing to complain about. If you are working long overtime hours for no
    extra pay, you have a right to complain. \r\n\r\nIf you're a freelancer, it's
    up to you to manage your time. I find working for myself I am much more efficient,
    I can do a full day's work in 5-6 hours and I tend to overbook myself a bit to
    hedge against the leaner times.\r\n\r\nEverybody works at a different pace, as
    well. I learned, as art director, that there are people who can simultaneously
    juggle several different jobs and do all of them equally well and others who need
    to focus on one task at a time, more slowly and deliberately. So it became a matter
    of balancing what I assigned to my designers. I valued them all, but definitely
    appreciated the ones who I could throw an extra curve ball at and they'd manage
    it OK. Those are the types who are more likely to become art directors themselves.\r\n\r\nIn
    any event, there are a lot of designers struggling for work, I'd not complain
    about being too busy if I were you."
