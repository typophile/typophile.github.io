  She thinks we ought to design all of our pubs in 1-column. \r\n\r\nAnyone else share
  this reader's view that online pubs should be 1-column only? And how to coordinate
  hard copy publications with electronic ones?"

    body: "Hi, I tried to post a PDF but can't. Sorry but I'm a newbie at this!\r\n\r\nThe
      printed page uses a 3-column format--and was designed this way for the print
      version as text in 1-column across a letter-size page is too difficult to read.
      But when viewers read it online, it's disconcerting to go down and up again
      in columns. Does this make sense?\r\n\r\nSo...is there a way (or have you seen
      examples) of hard copy pubs that consider this in online versions of the same
      pubs? Or do you think most readers would simply download the entire PDF and
      read in hard copy form anyway? \r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    stands for the page in the hard copy and n the number of the corresponding column.\r\nAs
    easy as ABC."

    copy form anyway?</cite>\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts on this:\r\n\r\nIt depends
    on the information you're publishing and how you anticipate readers using it.
    If you're publishing recipes, yes most will print the pages. If it is a trade
    journal with news and columns, people will likely only print portions. Since some
    browers allow PDF's to open directly within, i think many people expect to interact
    with those documents in the same way they do Web sites: As you've pointed out,
    people don't want to have to scroll up and down. And why should they?\r\n\r\nYou
    may want to consiser publishing the content directly to a Web page, with text
    in one-column, and just offer the PDF as a \"printer-friendly\" option.\r\n\r\nI
    believe there may be ways to use CSS to identify the output destination. I think
    you could have one set of CSS for the printed version, and one for online viewing.
    This may require designing the documents coded with XHTML. (I have no experience
    with this, but i've heard it's pretty great when you need to use CSS to specify
    differing destinations for the content.\r\n\r\nIf you're working in InDesign,
    look up info in the HELP section about repurposing content from PDFs. If done
    well, you could actually create one PDF document that can be optimised for use
    on the Web, in print and even on a PDA.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nRead this
    to hear about how Web designers are tackling the opposite problem: \r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/"

  body: "A quick read is easier when the lines aren't too long, it helps the eye recatch
    itself when it gets lost in the words. \r\n\r\nFor print I try and stay  below
    60-70 picas for long copy. \r\n\r\nI think the problem is it's a different story
    for reading from a monitor. The distance the eye travels and scans words is different
    than on paper. I suggest going between a single full line and three columns, why
    no try a two column. You'd better test this one a few times, but only take the
    advice you received as a problem to fix, and don't listen to the solution unless
    you weight all the options. I hardly believe a single column is the answer unless
    the column is a short distance."
