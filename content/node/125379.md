body: "Hi everyone.\r\n\r\nI apologize for using my first post on this amazing forum
  to ask for help in identifying a font, but I'm really fond of ancient documents'
  fonts (books, legal documents, etc.) and I'm currently having troubles with one
  belonging to a Certificate of Birth of the Territory of Hawaii dated 1904.\r\nI'm
  looking for a match, or at least a reasonably similar alternative, to the font used
  for \"TERRITORY OF HAWAII.\" in the attached picture. I don't even know how to classify
  such a font... shadowed? inlined? engraved? My manifest ignorance about typefaces
  made almost impossible for me to even find an appropriate category where similar
  fonts can be sought.\r\nTo be accurate, I'm looking for a font resembling the one
  shown in the picture and having the same \"shadow effect\".\r\nAny help will be
  very appreciated! Thank you very much for your attention and kindness.\r\n\r\nAlessandro."
