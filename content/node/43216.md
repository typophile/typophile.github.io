  useful for professional networking? Is it just another Facebook but with a resume
  attached?\r\n\r\nFacebook, I don't think I quite get the point of. Yeah, OK it can
  be fun, and I can find out about events I'm interested in but I could find out about
  them as easily bay different means. It seems to mainly be a vehicle for delivering
  movie quizzes. Is it fair to compare the two?\r\n\r\n"

    if you want it to be. Facebook is really quite flexible \u2014 and it's simple
    too. I think it's currently the best way for most people to create a web page
    about themselves and to find others.\r\n\r\nI can't really say much for Linkedin.
    I'm on it, but I've only visited the site to accept connection requests. It is
    certainly more oriented towards job seeking and business relationships."

  body: "I have not found LinkedIn particularly useful professionally. I'm on it but
    like Stephen only to accept connection requests.Other people have told me they
    have gotten job queries from it though. I don't know what they're doing that I'm
    not necessarily.\r\n\r\nFacebook - I dunno - it is a LOT of fun but I can't see
    that any of it is professional. I play Scrabulous, superpoke my friends, get told
    that I look like a cat, figure out all the places in the world I've been,  and
    match up words to protect the rainforest. Excellent way to waste time!\r\n\r\nLinkedIn
    ramped up first among my crew - both professional and personal connections. But
    Facebook is the Obama of the two - it surged out of nowhere and now it seems more
    people I know are on that. Probably just to play quizzes and conquer the world
    though.\r\n\r\nMy brother (who is in the tech world) tells me people he know use
    Facebook for their primary email nowadays because there is no spam. I wouldn't
    do that because I can't see any way to organize the InBox.\r\n\r\nPut another
    way - I'm on Facebook all the time. Linked In I look at maybe once a week."

    just have an account so I don\u2019t get repeated requests to join and connect.
    Facebook seems much more useful, especially in DC where the people with money\u2014at
    least the ones who spend it\u2014are yuppies who got hooked on Facebook in school
    or via friends who are in school."

  body: "I started getting LinkedIn messages a few years ago from good friends. It
    is just a list of people to keep up with. No work from it, but I didn't expect
    that really. As soon as I joined all the people I used to work with in publishing
    got back in touch. I\u2019m pretty neutral about it."

  body: "I use LinkedIn to ask nerdy questions of other professionals - there's a
    lot of dreck in the Q&A section, but as a freelancer it allows me to retain some
    of the benefits of having colleagues!  Things like: \"OK, who's used Yahoo's UI
    toolkit and is it any good?\"  If I were a type designer, Typophile would be sufficient
    for that, but I'm a web designer who walks both the design and tech sides of the
    line.  LI's tech Q&A seems much stronger than the design one, btw - I think there's
    way more developers than designers answering questions.\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "LinkedIn is for business and your mostly co-worker connections to those you
    worked with. For best use, you should connect with people you have worked with
    first-hand. That's one of the banes of it I think---many times people ask to connect
    with me and I decline it. Sure, we know each other, but cant vouch for experience
    working together at all. It's a great site overall, it proves invaluable for business
    networking for myself and many people I know. Because it a business network, you
    wouldnt add your mom to it.\r\n\r\nFaceBook is a social network of Friends to
    connect and interact with. It's more robust in the way of interacting with your
    connections, with games and messaging etc. Unlike LinkedIn, becasue its a friend
    network, you WOULD add your mom to this."

    exactly? I mean for me it's been fun to find a few old friends/colleagues on there,
    but I can't say it's led to anything I couldn't have accomplished the old fashioned
    way, just by reaching out. I don't see a lot of activity going on beyond racking
    up the connections. I suppose if you don't have your own web site (as I do) it
    might be a handy place to post your resume but has it led to job opportunities
    for you?\r\n\r\nMy mom and I in fact have worked together - on 4 books! So I actually
    would add her to LinkedIn if only she was into that sort of thing."

    (I was after freelancing) just wanted to see a close up of a print ad I had in
    my web porfolio as he had thought of something similar for a design project of
    his own.
