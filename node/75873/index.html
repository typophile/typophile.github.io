  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I had been looking around for Hebrew fonts on the Web, now that my understanding of which font is which has improved.</p>
<p>I found that I was navigating the Calmus site wrongly, and they do have versions of their fonts available that work on Windows, not just for Linux.</p>
<p>However, I also found some puzzling things.</p>
<p>One is that the free Hebrew font from Bible Study Tools appears to be a demo font, because two of the final forms - for Kaph and Mem - are reduced in size slightly, so they don&rsquo;t come up to the normal top line of the other characters.</p>
<p>This could be intentional to prevent it from being used commercially for publishing instead of just viewing texts, but I didn&rsquo;t see anything about that on their site.</p>
<p>Another is that I couldn&rsquo;t find a font corresponding to the type style labelled as &ldquo;Rabbinic&rdquo; in old type catalogues, such as that of ATF. This style is better known as &ldquo;Rashi&rdquo;, and is the style used for some of the Gemara in traditional editions of the Talmud, to distinguish them from the Mishnah. (There is a closely related style, &ldquo;Vaybertaytsh&rdquo;, used for Yiddish typesetting. I haven&rsquo;t found any fonts for that style either.)</p>
<p>Except, that is, until I found one site which had a mix of freeware and shareware fonts; it didn&rsquo;t identify which was which. They mentioned a Rashi font. It turned out it was part of a package of six fonts, and those fonts actually belonged to an application program for typing Hebrew on your computer. Under Windows 3.1, and they were non-Unicode. The package was shareware, though.</p>
<p>I looked to see if I could find the present site of whoever made the program. I didn&rsquo;t find that, but I did find the Rashi font by itself, billed as a free font, on a font search site. That, though, isn&rsquo;t necessarily evidence that it&rsquo;s really a free font now, as many designers here know all too well. What I couldn&rsquo;t find was a current site either for the font&rsquo;s designer, Aaron Schmiedel, or for the company that made the shareware program, KESHERworks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I found another allegedly free Rashi font floating around the Web. This one is a Unicode font, and it belongs to a collection called the &ldquo;Kivun Core Fonts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A web search turned up a claim that they were designed for IBM at one time long ago, and it gave a list of the styles in the package.</p>
<p>The one I found, though, contains at least one font that tells me that this can&rsquo;t <em>possibly</em> be a set of free fonts. One of them is called Koren!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is a set of fonts that Shmuel Gutman created for a now-defunct company called Accent-Kivun. Microsoft bought these typefaces and bundled at least some of them (including Koren/Keren) in Office.</p>
<p>I can of course only comment on the Koren font. This was not produced by Mr Gutman z&quot;l with permission of Koren and is now the subject of a court case between Koren and Microsoft!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they were designed for IBM though. Kivun was a company creating a multilingual wordprocessor which allowed different keyboards and language support the idea being that european companies might find this useful. Half of my friends worked there at the time (it was a company employing all the frum anglos in Jerusalem!</p>
<p>I told them that the concept was irrelevant since the next version of Windows allowed this functionality built-in. The response was, er, really? The company went bankrupt shortly thereafter!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I am just glad, then, since this didn&rsquo;t include the properly licensed Koren, they weren&rsquo;t bundled with the Israel version of OS/2. Presumably, of course, as Type 1 fonts, and converted as well as distributed in violation of the license. It means there will be no need to sue IBM.</div>
