body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI have been asked to redo the text for a male clothing
  brand. They want the Snag part to be bold and masculine but the clothing part to
  be smaller and have a bit of contrast between the two. This is what I have come
  up with. Does anyone think this looks good? Can anyone suggest anything?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20BayViewTrail001_6722.jpg]"

  body: "Did you stretch those letters or is that an extended weight? The vertical
    strokes seem disproportionately thick. As for the lower line, I\u2019ll quote
    Jan Tschichold: \u201CIt is generally wrong to letter lines not containing the
    same width just in order to achieve a squared off effect.\u201D. That lower line
    reeks of work that was rushed or simply done with little interest. It\u2019s a
    pretty generic solution that I often see on badly designed signs in front of government
    buildings."

  body: "Does the logo even NEED to say clothing? many / most successful clothing
    lines generally go by their name (prada, armani, &c). If the tag is on a pair
    of jeans, I don't think it's necessary to tell someone that it's clothing. Perhaps
    this goes outside of your typography based inquiry and into branding (which you
    may or may not even be able to change), but it may free you up from what James
    was getting at.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, diesel's logo is somewhat similar to your
    approach, but theirs works a little better because they aren't trying to force-justify
    the tagline.\r\nhttp://www.pittimmagine.com/cimgs/diesel-logo200.jpg"

    does anyone know of a real nice font that can be used for this? Please note that
    the title must be all in caps. Has to have a masculine look to it. All ideas are
    welcomed. Thanks to everyone so far

  body: It's lacking any real contrast. Sure you have large and small, but the weight
    of the face is the same. Try a heavy extended for snag and a light extended for
    clothing.  If you're still looking for fonts try Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk.

  body: Well, if you go with Snag (not SNAG), you could tuck the clothing in to the
    left of the g's tail. It would be a start.

  body: "To me, metrosexual and masculine are somewhat opposite. The idea of \"metrosexuality\"
    makes me think of men who have accepted feminine ideas of fashion \xE6sthetics.
    That being said, it's hard to give one a \"masculine\" typeface. You don't want
    to fall into a stereotype, and use some faux-photocopied grunge font, or some
    chunky ultra-bold / slab serif just to evoke a feeling of masculinity. I think
    nearly any typeface, depending on how you dress it (no pun intended) can have
    the potential to serve a masculine purpose. I'd imagine the fashion style would
    be the biggest influence. Is it like american apparel, abercrombie & fitch, Banana
    republic, ralph lauren?\r\n"

  body: I don't want to make the job that you're getting paid for too easy, but Museo
    is a very cheap font, brand new and probably not used for the branding of any
    company. I find it to be one of the better metrosexual fonts out there, if there
    is such a thing.

  body: The letters look compressed, the distance between A and G must be fixed, also
    i would give some elegance to this since its something simple, play with the text
    as proposals, like bind the leters on a horizontal basis combine them, you can
    make ligatures, but this is totally another approach. Also i just noticed that
    the piramid inside the letter A (the negative inner space) the top path should
    get a bit higher.
