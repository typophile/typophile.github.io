  typeface, yes it is custom OMG :D.\r\nThis is first wave of digitalizing, btw it
  was done without tracing original sketches, I am waiting for my new scanner :D.\r\nSo
  I just put some numbers and started drawing.\r\nThis is it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ravelsans_3947.jpg]\r\n\r\nBtw
  do you have some advices on kerning, proportions say it :). I need some advices
  on E and L glyphs.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: The leg of the R extends a bit too far. Once you shorten it, you can nudge
    it closer to the A to balance the kerning. As for the E, your crossbar probably
    should be longer. The L looks fine to me.

  body: "On the whole I like it. I agree that the leg of the 'R' extends too far.
    I also think that if you bring the arm in, the bowl should be made wider to compensate
    for this. 'RA' is always a tricky kern because of the opposing angles of the 'R'
    leg and the 'A'. A wider bowl on the 'R' would fix this, as would loosening the
    kerning of the rest of the logo a bit.\r\n\r\nI actually like the short crossbar
    on the 'E' - it gives some air to the \"EL\" pair.\r\n\r\nOne last thing - watch
    the curves at the top of the 'R' bowl where the straight section meets the curved
    section. The curve is looking a little lumpy and might need to be smoothed out.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    great job.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I agree with what has already been said. The only other thing that bothers
    me is the width of the E and L. I've made a very small modification to their width,
    which I think is an improvement. FWIW, the change in width only equates to 3 pixels
    less at this resolution. I hope  it was ok to modify your image.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
    forward to seeing an update.\r\n\r\n(Top: original, bottom: modified)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ravel_4706.gif]"

    looks very sharp! Like it.\r\n "

  body: "Hi, thanks for all the comments. I got the idea for typeface on my english
    class at school haha.\r\n\r\nyes it is a bit lumpy because it was directly digitalized
    without scanning the sketches. :)\r\n\r\nSo at the end you want to se wider bowl
    or shorter leg.\r\nBtw I used golden ratio on crossbar on the E.\r\n\r\nThanks
    people.\r\nAndy no problem with modification, it looks nice. I could even use
    it."

  body: I just thought so. A bit of space between V and E, and L just proportionally
    out to balance.
