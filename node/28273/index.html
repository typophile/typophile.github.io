  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been trying to make a perfect dotted line in [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]], but nothing seems to work...
I've made my own dotted brush, but it keeps deforming in corners... I've tried using a dashed line with round corners & short dashes, but the dots are not perfect circles... At the end I just used the line as a textpath, typed bullets & shifted the baseline negatively to center the bullets on the line.
I've searched the internet on tutorials, but they only ever seem to be about expanding dashed lines (flatten transparency; for those interested). I refuse to believe Adobe still hasn't included some way to create a dotted line with perfect circles & an even spacing inbetween them.
Can anyone help?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use the same method as you settled on, I have tried brushes, but it really seems to be overcomplex or maybe what you and I are trying is too basic; the stroke method will produce circles as long as it isn't expanded using zero as the dash length, but it really seems too long a method to accurately produce a simple shape, when the text path trick works quicker and easier.

		<div class="commentbody">I did make a pattern brush with circles, 100% spacing & checked the box "add space to fit" so it wouldn't deform the circles. It works well for straight lines, but in sharp corners it turns the circles into rounded triangles. I think the best solution is indeed either using the dashed line with round corners or using your line as a textpath & fill it with bullets.
It seems strange though that Adobe never picked up on this problem & I can't imagine I'm the only person who wants to make a dotted line in Illustrator. Then again, it amazes me just as much that you need to flatten transparancy to expand a dotted line (which doesn't seem to have anything to do with it).
Maybe the best thing to do would be to adress this problem to Adobe & hope for the best when Illustrator CS3 comes out ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What drives me crazy are two things - one is that the spacing between the dots is kind of all over the place if you're making a shape with corners, such as a square. Quark on the other hand will always put a dot in each corner, although in Quark you can't adjust the spacing between the dots, only the thickness.

My other peeve is that if you go to "outline stroke" you get a solid rather than the dotted rule.

I've resorted to both the bullet method (and then doing "create outlines" for the type) and also making a tiny circle, step and repeating it, and then redistributing the spacing using "Align".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patrick’s solution is the one I use and the only problem I have is that there seems to be no option to automatically have a dot (or corner dash) in each corner. 

I know this would force the spacing or the dash-length but it would be a useful option where precise dot or dash spacing is less important than having neat corners.

Is this an option I have missed?</div>

It's a trick I found on the internet some time ago trying to find a way to expand dashed lines.
I still don't know what transparency has to do with dashed lines, but it works!
As far as the dotted line with a dot in each corner is concerned, I'm beginning to lose faith in Adobe... Maybe in CS3?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just made a couple, and they worked out okay. You have to have the math correct to make circles meet in the corners. For instance. a 240 x 200 point box, with 6 point circles placed 10 points apart works perfectly. (using a stroke of 0, gap of 10, and round caps). Another one, same size box, with 3 point circles placed 8 points apart. (stroke 0, gap 8, round).

The trick is to figure out the gap to fill the size of box you need.

And I don't understand the inability to get round circles in a stroked border. How are they not round?</div>

I don't mean to be a jerk, though this will sound like it, but in Freehand you've always had the option of a dotted line. I am hoping, as someone who was dragged kicking and screaming to Illustrator, that they will adopt this pretty basic tool in the next version (Now that they've bought freehand, they can cannibalize it). Just so I don't sound like too much of a complainer I will contribute this link I found on this subject, it isn't perfect but might be a quick fix:

		<div class="commentbody">I've been using Filip's method and it works great! However, I found that the circles/dots can become distorted if they are on an irregular path. This doesn't matter if your dots are only going to be a couple points wide, but it will matter if you want large dots.

You can fix this by creating the original dot with a Stroke INSTEAD of a Fill. Things to remember:
<ol>
<li>Make sure that the stroke fills the inside of the circle</li>
<li>The Stroke options MUST be set to "Round Join" and "Round Cap" (these are in the Stroke Palette")[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stroke_5381.jpg]</li>
<li>The wider the stroke is in comparison to the width of the circle, the less possibility there is for distortion. A 1pt circle with a 25pt should be more than sufficient to keep the dots circular. If you want to be more certain that they stay circular, just raise the stroke width.</li>
</ol>

Enjoy!</div>

Depending on what settings you have set for weight, line caps, and joins, you can create a stitched line, a skip line, or almost anything. You control the dash and gap (the space between each dash) by entering numbers into the Dash and Gap fields at the bottom of the stroke palette.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stroke_5382_3467.jpg]


If you're just using one sequence, you can enter just the first two fields. Or you can enter up to three different Dash and Gap settings to achieve complex dash patterns.

examples below:

with rounded caps the larger the weight the larger the gap number just play around n u'll get the effect u want.

		<div class="commentbody">Filip's method is probably the better option. To get the dots to 'outline', all you have to do is save your file in one of the old EPS formats. When you reload the file, the dots will only be there and not the lines.

When you do that though, make sure it's your final draft -- otherwise you'll lose your editability of the lines.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the instructions on how to do this. It works great. 

Here is my question:

I created the dotted line and now I need to use it in a different file. I drag and drop it into the new file, but it doesn't allow me to change the color of the dots. If I change the fill color, I get a faint line connecting the dots. I can change the outline color, but it has no effect on the dots. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks</div>

I've played around with illustraitor and i see what you mean about the 'faint line connecting the dots' the only way i found to stop this is to select the colour you want and then create the dashed stroke. it looks like illustrator doesn't like changing the colour after a dashed stroke has been made. something i hope they will fix in cs4.

While there *are* a couple of Illustrator users frequenting this site, it's mainly about typography. You might get better results when asked in an Illustrator-dedicated forum -- I'd suggest Adobe's own, <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/illustrator/illustrator_general">http://forums.adobe.com/community/illustrator/illustrator_general</a>.</div>
