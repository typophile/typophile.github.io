  I did of 18th century Armenian calligraphic style. Its the first letter of Armenian
  Alphabet - AIB (alpha, alef).\r\n\r\nDear Admin, I would also propose to create
  a Armenian Letters sub-forum in Special Interest Groups. I am sure that there are
  quite many Armenian font designers who are here and would join. Hrant Papazian is
  at least one of them I know :) "

    who cut those letters, its one of the most beautiful ones I have seen so far.
    I am writing a commentary now on a calligraphy book from Venice from 1834, its
    going to be very interesting. Can you resend that mail, Hrant jan, I was kind
    of in the middle of countries at that time...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/N_5060.-07-Aib-Stylized-Bolorgir-script-logo-01.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
