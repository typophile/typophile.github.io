<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This subject, "desktop publishing," has been discussed many times before but I am curious about the reactions graphic designers and/or font designers have had to the advent of technology driven design. Has it been good or bad for design, has it allowed a lot of mediocre "artists" to contribute to the field whereas previously they would never have had an interest in the black art of design? Much has happened since I saw an article I think in Publish magazine about the postscript printer, the gist of which was how it would change the graphics field forever. Has the introduction of publishing and designing software like PageMaker, Quark, Illustrator, Fontographer, etc., had an influence on the democratization of design? Obviously yes, but for good or bad? Now that design is accessible to everyone with a computer and the cash to buy the software can't everybody be a designer as I believe Rudy Vanderlans declared in an issue of Emigre? And if so what does this mean?

<div class=commentbody>If you can buy/pirate software and read tutorials doesn't automatically make you an experienced and original designer.
Good example: Web 2.0. A lot of sites use the same pastel colors, rounded corners, typefaces, etc, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Haven't there always been a lot of bad designers and very few great ones? I would suspect that is the case.
For good or bad I think it's fine that people are empowered. Just like the fact that lots of folks now have recording studios in their homes. Has it made music better? Definitely not, but the fact that they are empowered is a good thing. It has taken it out of the hands of the record companies, who used to be the only ones who could afford to produce records.
I think the worse side effect is what it's done to the decision making process. Changes are so easy to make now that decisions have been trivialized and end up getting made by the bosses wife… :)

<div class=commentbody>I'm a desktop publisher myself, but still I think through desktop publishing a lot of non-designers have found their way to a job they otherwise never would've considered. Still, I'm quite happy with my job as a simple desktop publisher & have no (more) intentions of persuing a job as a designer. The mayor difference between the 2 is probably the paycheck. I'm quite happy doing dull things for work in programs I love working with (nothing beats Illustrator in my opinion) & I can still use my creativity in my spare time. The advantage to that is that you never have to compromise (something that I've never been good at when it comes to my drawings). To be a good designer you need to be creative & able to make sacrifices to your own dislikings. Even in my job as a desktop publisher I've sometimes had the opportunity to create a logo for a local company, but I quickly realized that 9 times out of 10 the client will opt for the ugliest logo (or even worse: they come up with their own handdrawn logo you have to digitilize with so called "original" ideas; I once had to do a logo for a local tanning centre called "casa del sol" & they had the brilliant idea of making a sun of the "o" from sol). Sure the introduction of desktop publishing has left the gates open for a lot of inadequates to oppose themselves as designers, but on the brighter side, it probably makes designers more competative to proof their superiority. It's a knive that cuts both ways & in my case it made me realize that I'd rather keep my dull job and save my creativity for personal use; no compromises whatsoever. Even if I end up not using it for anything, I'll still have the pleasure of looking at the result knowing it's exactly how I wanted it to be. There have been a few interesting threads last week about designers vs. non-designers which you might enjoy reading as well.
I'll post the links later on.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think we already "met" in the "design limbo thread", Paul, didn't we? I was the first one there to advice the poster to stick to his dull job & save his creativity for personal use & thought I was going to get a lot a critique on that, but surprisingly a lot of people backed me up on that (including you). Thanks for backing me up here again ;-) I've had discussions with a few friends lately who feel I should do something with my drawings ("it's such a shame of talent, yada yada yada...") & I simply can not seem to explain to them how I feel about my work & I'm so excited that in the same week I found a whole group of people here who understand where I'm coming from & actually share my thoughts on this. I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am to have found kindred spirits. We're a rare breed, but thanks to specialized sites, we can talk freely about our passions without the risk of being misunderstood or being found a little unrealistic (in being too idealistic) or even immature. Typophile is my sacred site!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the links Tom to past threads. Interesting that some or many like the idea of separating their professional work from the personal work. What is professional seems to be work which is dull but pays the bills and ultimately not very rewarding. I tend to share that view. And yes, everybody can be a designer. But there are good designers and not so good designers and on occasion great ones. I like the astute comment regarding being empowered. On many levels having the chance to try, to be empowered, is crucial in the sense that more people than previously will have the opportunity to do something that might not have done before. And I think that is very good.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The DTP revolution also empowered good designers to be able to have many options opened to them and ways to control their design far better than any time in history. There have always been bad users of every tool ever made. We can never stop a page butcher, we can only strive to make our own work at a high enough level that our labors succeed in improving the visual landscape (whie the garbage ends up in the visual landfill). It is not up to good designers to place an electrified fence around our tools that prevents those without design skills from having the freedom to try. It is not our job either to point and hiss at the unskilled. It is our job to do the best work we can with whatever tools we have. The door was opened to everyone in 1984. There has been more very good design done since then and more very bad design done since then. It was 1984, but we do not have to become "Big Brother" and watch over all.

<div class=commentbody>As for Chris's comment, I started drawing as soon as I could hold a pencil in my hand & never stopped until I actually went to art school after graduating from high school. I had real high hopes about it, but pretty much everything about it disappointed me. It seemed to me that they focused too much on technique rather than the results, eg. for model drawing we hàd to draw guidelines (which I never did 'cause I'd be too misled by them and ended up with a completely deformed model) & I just added them at the end just so I wouldn't get any comment on it. They also actually forbade me to use squared paper for sketching (which I've always prefered and still do) because -occording to them- it would inhibite me in my designs. Art school teachers should be openminded about different techniques & preferences as long as the results are just as good, but most of my teachers were too hung up on their approaches. Maybe art school teachers are what music critics are for the music industries (failed musicians/artists)? After a while I heard about a DTP-course and in that I refound my joy of drawing. To this day, I still don't draw manually anymore (only to make quick sketches) even though I practically spent 20 years of my life doing so.
In desktop publishing, I found a new way to express my creativity & found a job that comes somewhat close to that, but is different enough from it so I don't run the risk of losing the joy in my personal work again.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's given designers much more control than they had before, but in many cases more control than they wanted. Designers are now expected to know how to set type, where before that was left to typesetting experts. Whether this is liberating or a burden depends on how much control you desire.
It's also compressed job turn around times to nearly nothing. The idea of getting copy from a client and have a finished design on press a few hours later would have been unimaginable. Unfortunately, this increase in production speed has not necessarily given designers more time to work, it has more often allowed people earlier in the production process to start later. (I have seen this happen over and over any time I've figured out a faster way to do something--an in-house stat camera, using FedEx, etc.)
One other thing: You never have to worry about making things square. In fact, it requires extra effort to make things crooked. The opposite used to be the case with paste ups and mechanicals.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, this was the sentence I was refering to in your post:
The DTP revolution also empowered good designers to be able to have many options opened to them and ways to control their design far better than any time in history.
I went from a former manual cartoonist to a computer illustrator/hobbyist through DTP (with much more options to make my designs fit my ideas a whole lot better) and found a job in something I always wanted to do (drawing) in it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>DTP is just the culmination of a trend that started 40 years ago. Compugraphic and others started selling typesetting machines based on the idea that "a secretary" can set the type now. Of course, the people who bought the machines found that the "secretary" had to be trained to the point where she was a typographer, not a secretary, and was no longer willing to work for secretarial wages.
DTP is just the newest tool. It (fortunately) does not confer skill or talent on the user. Heck, now you can design type with a $600 piece of software. That doesn't mean that the type will be good.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually Don Type Tool 3 is a great tool for $99. Whether one uses TT3 or FontLab Studio or Fontographer or all 3 (I do) doesn't matter one bit when it comes to the quality of the font. Good design will always be good whether or not one uses whatever tool. In fact, a good friend works for a fancy New York firm and doesn't use a computer. He is still a real art director. i.e., he directs the staff on what to produce as a final result and that staff does whatever they do to achieve that end using whatever tools they have to work with. Of course this is probably a bit unusual but it does happen.</div>
