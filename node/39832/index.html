  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I suppose this is silly, but with all the programmers around, it seems important to get the terminology correct.</p>
<p>So, using Fontlab Studio 5.0.4, when I enter the correct Unicode index for the terminal sigma in Greek (U+03C2), and hit the little green diamond by the &ldquo;name&rdquo;, I get &ldquo;sigma1&rdquo; for the name. I had always termed it &ldquo;sigma.terminal&rdquo;. Now I know at some level the &ldquo;name&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t matter, but it seems wise to get it right.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with the script theta (U+03D1) and alternate phi (U+03D5) &ndash; FontLab names them &ldquo;theta1&rdquo; and &ldquo;phi1&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is also a terminal iota (used in some ligatures), which I&rsquo;ve named &ldquo;iota.terminal&rdquo;, which would seem at variance with calling the terminal sigma &ldquo;sigma1&rdquo; &ndash; should it be &ldquo;iota1&rdquo;?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on is that we&rsquo;re making up, for our own use, an OpenType version of Wilson Greek (with Matthew Carter&rsquo;s permission). Since there are a lot of ligatures in Wilson Greek, it would be nice to get the names consistent so I can figure out what in the world I&rsquo;ve done wrong as I go back &amp; fix all the mistakes I make in the features code.</p>
<p>&amp; BTW, just from a historical perspective, since this Greek is more of a script, I wonder why the script theta isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;default.&rdquo;? I notice the Greek Font Society used Wilson Greek in their English volume, but used the U+03B8 theta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting a lot of the ligatures in Stylistic sets; Carter indicated that the ligatures that were used originally were the alpha_iota combinations, alpha_upsilon combinations, alpha-final sigma, and epsilon-iota combinations at the beginning of words.</p>
<p>Following an idea of Nick Shinn&rsquo;s, lower-numbered stylistic sets will have these; higher numbered sets the less-used ligatures.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Charles</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Names like sigma1, theta1 and phi1 are old Adobe Glyph List names, which means that they are mapped to the corresponding Unicode codepoints by Acrobat glyph name parsing, but you can also use uniXXXX form names for the same result.</p>
<p>I usually call the terminal sigma &lsquo;sigmafinal&rsquo; during development, and switch to &lsquo;uni03C2&rsquo; for font generation. &lsquo;sigma.terminal&rsquo; is not a good idea, at least for font generation, because Acrobat will parse that as the regular sigma character, not the final form, since it treats the dot as indicating a glyph variant.</p>
<p>The final sigma is a distinct character in Greek text. But the variant forms of theta and pi, etc. that are included in Unicode are symbol characters, for mathematics etc., and not intended for use in regular Greek text. So my advice is to treat these forms as glyph variants, accessible via discretionary or contextual OpenType Layout features. In that case, you would name them e.g. theta.alt, phi.alt, etc.</p>
<p>For ligatures, use the _ convention, e.g. delta_alpha_uni03C2.</p>

<p>Good point on namimg the terminal sigma. I don&rsquo;t anticipate anybody taking the text from a PDF file with one of our jobs (we&rsquo;ll furnish XML for a nominal fee), but one never knows.</p>
<p>As to the theta: Well, yes, the script theta is used in mathematics, but there was a time when it was the favored for text &ndash; see, for example, <cite>LES GRECS DU ROI: graves par Claude Garamont de 1544 a 1550 &ndash; Tableau des Ligatures</cite>.</p>
<p>I had rather thought the script theta appropriate with Wilson Greek.</p>

<p>Anybody who uses Search within Acrobat, anyone who uses Spotlight on the Mac, anyone who uses Google on the web &ldquo;takes the text from a PDF file&rdquo; — or more specifically, those applications do it for you so they can perform the search.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Adam,</p>
<p>Our PDF files are suppose to go to the printer, and be a back-up archival copy of a book in case the publisher sells the rights to another publisher &amp; the second publisher, for some reason, wants to try &amp; get the text from the PDF file &ndash; which requires a lot of cleanup, when you consider that all the footnote calls come through as regular numbers, etc. Far easier to work from an XML file.</p>
<p>But I take you point. I don&rsquo;t approve of sloppy fonts, and these days, even simple code like character names are more than a transitory part of the font. We are long past the Type 1 days when you had to come up with your own name just to encode &amp; set the character (&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, did I name that aacutehook or ahookacute?&quot;).</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m not saying that the form should not be used, but that it should be encoded as the theta letter character code, not as the symbol character code, and any variation in the form should be handled at the OpenType Layout level, not at the encoding level.</p>
<p>According to Yannis Haralambous, there is a tradition in French publishing of Greek to use the open (scribal) theta at the beginning of a word and the closed form within a word. As far as I can tell from my analysis of older Greek books (e.g. Aldine or Stephani publications) the forms are mixed pretty freely. Indeed, I wonder if they might have been mixed in the same case compartment and the typesetter just used whichever he grabbed.</p>
