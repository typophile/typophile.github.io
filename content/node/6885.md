body: <b>Dear all</b>, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m doing some research on newspaper typography,
  and right now I&#39;m looking for what has been written on the subject. So far &#40;only
  just started&#41; I&#39;ve found some very good articles written by <a href="http://www.linotype.com/7-411-7/andreacuteguumlrtler.html"

  body: 'Mr Lo-Fi at your service. <BR>I see you&#39;ve already found the Gurtler
    stuff - that&#39;s primo. I didn&#39;t know about DTP though - could you tell
    me more about it? And how can I get a copy of the article in the second picture
    on that page? <BR> <BR>A major author to track down is Allen Hut: he&#39;s written
    2 or 3 books on the topic as well as a number of articles in magazines. One of
    the articles was about Walter Tracy, who was also a newspaper man of sorts. Besides
    his book &#34;The Typographic Scene&#34;, he&#39;s written some articles, including
    one in Typographica and another in Interpressgrafic, which had an issue in 1971
    with a couple of news type articles, the other being by Matthew Carter: a superb
    elaboration on the design of Olympian &#40;which was a pretty groundbreaking design&#41;.
    The most recent work you should check out is John Berry&#39;s &#34;Contemporary
    Newspaper Typography&#34;. <BR> <BR>BTW, something important: as you seem to suspect,
    the separation of typography and overall design is dangerous. Although the more
    you broaden away from the type itself the less relevant things are to the type&#42;,
    even things like the paper being tabloid or broadsheet&#42;&#42; do affect the
    type. Basically, everything matters, even company politics - Roger Black&#39;s
    article in Berry&#39;s book about the LA Times is a prime example of that. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; What I mean for example is that the column width is more relevant than
    the page size. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; BTW, I have this Russian newspaper that actually
    mixes the formats: most of it is tabloid, but the innermost spread is made into
    a single broadsheet page! I was thinking that you could even make multiple inside
    pages that open the other direction. <BR> <BR>hhp'

- body: Hrant,  <BR>One of my goals was actually to explore the demands on newspaper
    type in this tabloidic era. <BR>we have the Tracy books in the library, I&#39;ll
    give them an additional glance.  <BR> <BR>Brendan, <BR>Yes, good old Times. Compared
    to <i>any</i> modern newspaper type face it is still, if nothing else, insanely
    economic. In that sense it&#39;s a benchmark. <BR> <BR>And speaking of economy;

    this is included in the recent Batty Publishing reprint? <BR>I don&#39;t remember
    seeing it in the table of contents, which means I might need to track down the
