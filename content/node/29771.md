body: "Hi , what are your opinions,\r\n\r\n\r\nWith <strong><a href=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=katarine\">Katarine</a>
  </strong> as an occasional headline font, and to create short bold word's for impact,
  which other font for more general use (text, signage) would you choose?\r\n\r\nThis
  is the general direction:\r\nSlighly humanistic sans serif, with double story 'g'
  if poss.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nMy suggestions would be:\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* <strong>Freight
  Sans</strong> http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php\r\n\r\n* <strong>Mundo
  Sans</strong> http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=403346\r\n(although
  very nice, much picier than Freight)\r\n\r\n* <strong>Vista Sans</strong> http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=200\r\n\r\n*
  <strong>Vecta</strong> http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wilton/vecta/\r\n(doesn't seem
  to be very flexible in therms of features) \r\n\r\n* <strong>Agenda</strong> http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso
  a factor would be the level of value for money (e.g. Opentype with different figure
  styles prefered to Postscript with ordinary character palette).\r\n\r\nI'm really
  looking for thhe main typeface along those lines, and <a href=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=katarine\">Katarine</a>
  will be used to liven things up on occasions.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your thoughts."

  body: "Forget about Vecta (I don't think now it's right) and think about nice printed
    leaflets and stationary, and signage. \r\n\r\nThe main direction I have given
    with the sample face, but I don't really want to talk about target audience with
    this. In order so that any advice won't be based on a labels and preconceptions.
    But I can say, the target audience is pretty much everyone."

  body: "Muj,\r\n\r\nIf you can wait a few weeks, Mundo Sans Pro will be available
    soon. It will probably seem even pricier, but all 7 weights, both Roman and Italic,
    have small caps, CE language support, superior and inferior figs, numerators and
    denominators, Lining and Oldstyle figs both tabular and proportional, even monetary
    symbols to match the OSFs. Plus the OT features to support all these extra glyphs.\r\n\r\nI've
    been caught here saying \"soon\" about Mundo Pro, but it really is finished, produced
    and just waiting to be released. \r\n\r\nNot to hype it too much, but Mundo was
    designed for wide general use; it is readable and clear in small sizes, and in
    fact the bolder weights were based on handpainted signage. Useful at any size
    (with appropriate tracking of course) and available in 7 weights. "
