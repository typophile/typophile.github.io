  to take things further with Helvetica. Can anyone tell me if any guides are available
  on perfect kerning for the typeface Helvetica. \r\n\r\nFor example manual kerning
  with equal space just doesn't feel enough for me, if you have a sentence with the
  letter 'e' in twice next to each other, the equal spaced kerning throughs the balance
  off and the word starts to look different in comparison to letters that kern nicely
  with equal spacing.\r\n\r\nSo with that all in mind, does anyone have any advice
  on taking kerning further in order to balance words perfectly, and finding what
  spaces work with what letters etc,\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\nAlex."

  body: "As you have observed, letterfit is contextual -- kerning is usually taken
    to be the letterfit between a pair of letters without regard to context.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect\"
    seems to ask for a mathematical solution. You might find one when the letters
    too have a mathematical construction, say, all vertical strokes at 90 degrees,
    as often found in LED displays. But we tend to reject that, and like the letters
    themselves, letterfit becomes an aesthetic matter, allowing for varying opinions.
    One obvious example is the varyious kerning approaches taken with the apostrophe.
    Some like it so tight it becomes almost a diacritical, others feel it deserves
    it's own space, like a letter.\r\n\r\nOnce varying opinion enters the equation,
    common agreement is usually achieved only by the time-honored practice of the
    threat.\r\n\r\n<cite>If you don't give me the deed to your ranch,</cite>\r\n<cite>I'll
