body: "Hi there. I'm working on a rebrand for a technological company which creates
  software solutions for mobile phones / smart phones. It's a rapidly expanding company,
  at the cutting edge of this technology and I want a type family which reflects this
  but doesn't look like it's trying too hard to be trendy. I was thinking of one of
  Xavier Dupr\xE9s' typefaces - possibly Sanuk (I know Sony used Vista) - but I'd
  like to hear if anyone has any other ideas as I think Sanuk may be a bit harsh.
  They currently use Futura. Obviously it will have to translate across the all usual
  corporate literature.\r\nThanks\r\nSarah\r\n"

    symbols and patterns. Good for branding and available as OTF. Have a look here...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nor

  body: Thanks Stefan - I've had a quick look at Sophisto and think it could fit the
    bill. I'd like to give it a tryout anyway, it does appear to cover all the bases
    and offer a fair bit of variety.

    \r\nSanuk is in it, but also Klavika and Camingo, for example. You can <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28458\">find
    it here</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd Sophisto is a very nice typeface, Stefan."
