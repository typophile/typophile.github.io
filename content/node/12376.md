  body: "Thank you all for your suggestions. AG is quite close what I'm searching
    for. Too bad the family is quite pricey, there's propably no way to purchase just
    one weight?\r\n\r\nThe face I'm looking for is a classic sans with a \"weak personality\".
    Something that Reid Miles would have put on a record cover in the 50s/early 60s.
    Just an extremely small sprinkle of modern flavor might be a good thing.\r\n\r\nI
    like Mark Simonsons Proxima Sans Black, just hoping it was a bit wider. It has
    some modern flair, yet quite classic."
