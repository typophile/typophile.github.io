body: firstly pardon my english... <BR> <BR>I have been making fonts for 5 years.
  Two years ago I thought I was ready to sell them... two years later after endless
  kerning pairs and tweaks I am almost ready. So as I&#39;m building the site to sell
  them I&#39;ve come across a few questions...  <BR> <BR>As much we love type, even
  make them ourselves, and love to look at them... <BR> <BR>1.Does anyone regularly
  buy fonts?  <BR> <BR>2.How does anyone feel about the font prices? <BR> <BR>3.How
  many times did you need accent characters/special and they where not there? or made
  due <BR> <BR>4.How interested are you in non traditional but nice looking font design?
  ie the font &#34;enabler&#34; <BR> <BR>5.Anyone have experience selling fonts through
  a font house or sell them yourself? if so how was it <BR> <BR>Also any advise you
  can give would hugely appreciated? <BR>modestly thanx

  body: '&#62; 1.Does anyone regularly buy fonts? <BR> <BR>I have a nasty font licensing
    habit that I&#39;m doing my best to curb right now. <BR> <BR>&#62; 2.How does
    anyone feel about the font prices? <BR> <BR>The foundries from which I have licensed
    have fair pricing: Emigre, Font Bureau, FontShop, Hoefler&amp;Frere-Jones, Underware,
    House Industries .. all reasonable for the quality and customer service offered.
    I also use MyFonts which has again, I think, fair pricing for those foundries
    whom they represent. <BR> <BR>&#62; 3.How many times did you need accent characters/special
    and they where &#62; not there? or made due <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve become spoiled by
    full character sets. I really think you limit yourself by not including as many
    as you can. <BR> <BR>&#62; 4.How interested are you in non traditional but nice
    looking font &#62; design? ie the font &#34;enabler&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not
    sure I follow this question. <BR> <BR>&#62; 5.Anyone have experience selling fonts
    through a font house or sell &#62; them yourself? if so how was it <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t, but I think it will come down to how much time do you have to do your
    own marketing?'
