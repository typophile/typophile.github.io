  body: As with any large corporation, even if it looks like a font it&#39;s probably
    custom. That said, it is very similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/franklin-gothic/extra-condensed/testdrive.html?s=YAMAHA&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed</a>. The middle join of the M
    is higher and the weight stress is slightly less thick-and-thin. Could be they
    started from Franklin Gothic. Or not.

  body: Ooh! I got a nasty server error when I posted that. We must have hit the button
    at exactly the same time. Or maybe not. It happened with this one too.
