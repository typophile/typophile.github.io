  been enjoying for the past few years on my Web site, but I&#39;ve never known any
  foundry &#40;online or otherwise&#41; that currently supplies it. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  a great typeface '

  body: 'I found reference to the same font in a 1988 VGC one-liner and the 1989 Linotype
    handbook. Modula was designed by one F. Heigemeir in 1972 and the copyright is
    attributed to VGC. There are actually four weights in this family: Regular, Medium,
    Bold, Extra Bold. I can probably scan in the examples I have if you like. <BR>
    <BR>As for availability, the face probably lies at the bottom of the corporate
    abyss that is and once was the Visual Graphics Corporation.'
