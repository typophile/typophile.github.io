body: "I would like a critique of my first typeface design, it is comprised of 3 versions:
  a standard clean neo-grotesque, an alternative version that has multiple alternatives,
  and a \"advertising\" version that has a much higher x height, along with a shorter
  ascender/descender line, with a more expressive feel to it. all three versions will
  be released under the name \"Dawson Grotesque\" \r\nAll advice is appreciated! This
  has been a project of mine for quite some time \u2014 and is my first baby, so please
  help me make it perfect for its release in the near future ! \r\nThanks ."

  body: "Hi Simon, it's certainly a sui generis typeface as it shows influence from
    grotesque, geometric and humanist sans alike. \r\n\r\nMy first impression is that
    there are some design decisions that need to be standarized throughout the font
    like for example stroke modulation: some letters like the lower case e, s or t
    show blunt monolinearity but then some letters show widened incised style terminals
    and then some others show humanist sans serif style modulation like the lower
    case g, d, b, q and p.\r\n\r\nRound letter terminals are not uniform either: in
    the C and the c the upper one is slanted and then on the e and s the lower one
    is slanted.\r\n\r\nIt's not a sin to mix styles as long as the result shows coherence.
    I believe you have to work on those details to give the font stylistic coherence...
    unless your point is to make an intentional dissonant postmodernist mix. I believe
    the font is going in a very interesting direction but needs a better definition
    of it's style."

  body: "H\xE9ctor give you a pretty good advice. So I would not repeat what he wrote.
    However I would suggest to concentrate your effort on one style only. Choose the
    one you personally prefer and do all the design change you need to get the stylistic
    coherence that H\xE9ctor suggest. After and only after you will be ready to work
    on an alternate style. Keep going. "

  body: "The Advertising style is a very good idea!\r\n\r\nOne thing that immediately
    bugged me: the totally different style of the single and double quotes. In the
    context of the rest of the design, I'd go for the clean, slanted and slightly
    tapered single quotes. The bells on the double quotes look out of place here,
    and I think that if you make them square, they'd get too thick for comfort."
