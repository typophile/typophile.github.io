  body: Chuck Bigelow used minuscule during his lecture at TypeCon in Buffalo and
    also at one of the Unicode conferences I attended. He says it with pronounced
    stress on the second syllable, which sounds a little odd to me since I usually
    stress the first syllable, but he may well be correct.

  body: "Hello there\r\n\r\nI am not absolutely aware of any english-specific use
    of these words, but being french myself, I have to say that there is a huge difference
    between a \"capitale\" and a \"majuscule\": a majuscule is the first capital letter
    of a word (at the beginning of a sentence, in a family name, etc) - and that's
    it, period. To name every other capital letter in a sentence a majuscule is basically
    a mistake. Don't worry though: 99,9 % of John Does out there are making this mistake.
    Only the die-hard typophiles know about that... And that's a shame. In french
    typography, we also use the term \"bas de casse\" to describe a minuscule, for
    these were placed (as you know) at the bottom of the typographer's furniture (the
    \"casse\", \"case\" in english). The word \"capitale\" comes from the fact that
    these letters were placed at the top of the furniture, metaphorically called the
    \"head\", in latin: \"capitalis\".\r\n\r\nThis being said, I think that the use
    of \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase\" is strongly inappropriate since the disappearing
    of the case. As a typophile, I'd rather use \"capital\", \"majuscule\" and \"minuscule\"
    when I speak (in english) with someone who has a minimum typographic knowledge.\r\n\r\nHope
    I brought some interesting info here,\r\ndr"

  body: "Craig\r\n\r\nI think the melding of letter arts, from the calligraphic to
    the typographic (and everything in between), has created a bit of conflict in
    terminology.\r\n\r\nAs Graham, above, and many of my peers in the calligraphic
    field will attest, minuscule and majuscule are the accepted terms in our field
    (whether it is correct or not by French standards [talk to the British... their
    calligraphic books over the last century are replete with these references]).
    Caps and lowercase are used by us when the conversation turns to type (I would
    say those terms are antiquated but I don't want to see what they come up with
    to replace them). As to the hand-drawn issue it is as futile as the argument about
    whether calligraphy is art or craft. In my work and the majority of others our
    type IS hand drawn, it has just made the transition from paper and ink to digital
    form.I often see the term hand drawn lettering on this site. That is redundant.
    I also see the term lettering applied to buildings, typefaces used in titling
    etc. That is sign painting or whatever it is called these days and the other is
    type, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nAs to your contention that hand drawn... I agree
    with you. I think it is, in essence, a useless and ill informed modifier. At some
    stage it may have been lettering but by the time it is in digital form it is type,
    as long as they are repeatable forms and not a scanned title.\r\n\r\nI giggle
    at the term glyph. To me it has, and will always be, a carved form whether it
    is in stone or clay (from the Greek, glyphein, to carve). I will continue to create
    letters or characters in my fonts.\r\n\r\nNot a scholar but this stuff bothers
    me.\r\n\r\nMichael, One of those John Does"

    but by the same token another might giggle at your use of \"fonts\" to describe
    something made with no melting in the process. :-)\r\n\r\nMy point in showing
    the Dwiggins example was to pose a counterargument to James's contention that
    \"hand-drawn typography\" is a useless term. I think it's potentially useful for
    describing hand-drawn illustrations that mimic typography, which is how my eyes
    see Dwiggins's work. I think it's an especially interesting case, because it reverses
    the usual type-designers-emulating-lettering process."
