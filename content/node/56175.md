  book Marcel Broodthaers, \"Cin\xE9ma\" (photomontage by Joaquin Romero Frias): featuring
  the artist/poet Marcel Broodthaers holding Sadoul\u2019s \"L\u2019Invention du cin\xE9ma\"
  with a \"fig. 1\" printed on it. What I would really like to know is what a \"fig.
  2\" would look like. I intend to post more fonts from conceptual art that will be
  fun to identify. \r\n\r\nWhat is the font? \r\nWhat does the \"2\" look like in
  this format? "

  body: While there are stencil fonts available. Or pochoir if you like. This does
    look more like traditional pochoir.
