  don't mean to nag, but I know there are a lot of really talented fontographers here.
  And I know that they occasionally apply their expertise toward constructive advice...
  And I've tried to be a part of this community, writing several lengthy critiques

  body: reminds me A LOT of Museo and/or Museo Slab. I guess thats a good thing and
    a bad thing.

  body: "Ah yes. I knew someone would bring up Museo. I was going to nip it in the
    bud but I forgot :P\r\n\r\nI discovered Museo 3/4 of the way into designing this
    font (Shocking, I know, since I now can't seem to escape it). I was kind of sad
    at first because the U A V, etc. are similar, but my font (really wish I had something
    else to call it) is a serious slab serif, whereas Museo is a Sans that bends into
    serif-like bits occasionally. Also, Museo uses geometric circles in its round
    characters (or close to) and has a much higher x-height.\r\n\r\nI'd like some
    non-Museo oriented critique, but I think I will make a comparison chart..."

  body: I'm thinking of calling this font Albuquerque. Someone else suggested Culture
    Junkie, which was meant as an inside joke (she runs the Culture Junkies forum),
    but it actually wouldn't be bad. It has a good collection of characters, including
    an "re," which is one of this font's strongest pairs.

  body: "New version: (see first post)\r\n\r\nBiggest change was the Cap height, which
    I lowered by about the height of the serifs. Not a major change, but I think it
    made a major improvement.\r\n\r\nThe /M/ was altered a bit beyond that, making
    the slopes less pronounced. riccard0 probably still won't like it, but I had another
    friend urging me to keep it the same.\r\n\r\nNumerous other small adjustments,
    mostly optical compensation, and added characters."

    </cite>\r\nIndeed, Albu<strong>r</strong>querque has been misspelt in the US ever
    since (according to urban legend) that station master put it up wrong on the station
    sign.\r\n\r\nMore seriously, I like it, though the <em>q</em> bothers me.  The
    point would normally go higher, but to parallel the <em>g</em>, you've placed
    it in the middle.  This makes it stick out like a thorn.  What about doing a stub
    on the descender?  It's quite common in Spanish to write the <em>q</em> with a
    crossed descender.\r\n\r\nI agree with aliason about <em>h</em>, <em>n</em>, and
    <em>u</em>: but I think just be condensing the letters some you should be okay.
    \ The serifs aren't creating any extra space on the outside, just there's still
    a bit too much negative space on the inside.\r\n\r\nI'd probably also make the
    <em>A</em>'s spurs a bit bigger, in the smaller text they're practically invisible.
    \ The only other thing is I'm not sure those punctuation marks quote fit the style,
    but I'd need to see some more complex quoting action to know for sure how I feel
    about it."
