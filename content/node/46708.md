body: "Hey everyone,\r\nI'm looking for some new or interesting display serif fonts
  for editorial (mens magazine). I have been using Freight display and looking to
  try out something new. I love the simplicity of freight and cheltenham,  and perhaps
  there are some new ones people have in the works or could suggest? Many thanks!
  Also, one with a lovely italic set would be fantastic!\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nnick "
