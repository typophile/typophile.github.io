  body: "Herculanum using an alternate A and a mirror of the alternate N would be
    close, particularly if it was compressed somewhat http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/herculanum/
    There may be a  Cyrillic version of Herculanum. But note that many Cyrillic versions
    of fonts are unauthorized edits of existing Latin alphabet fonts.\r\nDon"
