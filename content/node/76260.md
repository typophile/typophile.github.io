body: "I'm interested in Baskerville's typeface revival produced in the first half
  of 20th century. There seems to be at least two other versions besides Monotype's.
  I'm quoting Tipowiki here:\r\n\r\n\"Interest in Baskerville seems to have revived
  in the early 20th century, with Bruce Rogers among others taking an interest in
  him. (...) Not surprisingly, therefore, the type was revived for mechanical composition
  in the 20th century. ATF was first, followed by English Monotype in 1923, and thereafter
  other manufacturers (notably linotype) followed suit. Monotype Baskerville (Series
  169), perhaps the best-known of these revivals was a commercially successful type
  despite (or perhaps because) it was heavily \"cleaned up\" by the Monotype drawing
  office Monotype's was based on a font designed for use at a fairly large size in
  an edition of Terence's comedies published in 1772. ATF and Linotype used strikes
  from genuine punches of a smaller size type; it is not therefore surprising that
  different versions of Baskerville look noticeably different: they are (or may) still
  be 'authentic'\".\r\n\r\nSo the questions are:\r\n1. Did Bruce Rogers ever made
  a revival himself or he just \"suggested\" to make one?\r\n2. Since Monotype's version
  was based on a large size and was \"cleaned up\", how were, if anybody ever saw
  them printed in books or in specimens, ATF and Linotype cuts?\r\n3. More specifically,
  is there any way to have a look at some ATF or Linotype Baskerville specimens?"

    this book is only in french for now, and it's a pity considering it's the most
    definitive and incredibly well illustrated encyclopedia of typography available
    today, without any equivalent in english)"

    when I get home next week, I can look for some information on Linotype's Baskerville.
    I think I might have some Griffith notes. \r\n\r\nAnd if no one comes forth sooner
    with images, I can produce a few scans for you. "

  body: "I'm surprised, though, that Monotype Baskerville is referred to as \"heavily
    cleaned up\". Because of the press techniques Baskerville himself used, and the
    care he took in making his type, the original Baskerville type was already \"slick\"
    and at least approached the modern standards of mechanical perfection that the
    use of the pantograph later established.\r\n\r\nSo, while I don't dispute that
    Monotype's Baskerville did not leave in any humanizing imperfections... that would
    still have been a light cleanup, because in the case of Baskerville, there wasn't
    much <em>there</em> to clean up. (And, of course, I am inclined to go even further,
    and express doubt that the cleanup really contravened Baskerville's intentions
    either.)"

  body: "Thanks everyone for their inputs; it would be helpful to see some samples
    posted here. It is curious that the Monotype version of Baskerville, based on
    a large size, thus - presumabily - a \"lighter\" typeface, has somehow come to
    define the \"standard\" Baskerville text type in the digital era (the fact that
    it is pre-installed on many machines didn't help either). It would be nice to
    see other metal reinterpretations also because nowadays there are half a dozen
    digital versions of Baskerville available, and they all look different; much different,
    I would say:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berthold_3606.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/classico_3418.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fountain_5036.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITC_5120.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monotype_5122.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scangraphic_3726.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/storm_5216.jpg]\r\n\r\nFrom

    Monotype, Scangraphic/Elsner & Flake, Storm.\r\n\r\nApart from ITC and Monotype,
    it seems like each of these typefaces was cut from a very different source."

    publishing company (from Italy). Luciano Perondi  recently designed for them a
    custom version of Baskerville with low contrast and a bigger x-height than original
    sources.\r\n\r\nI believe it was made to somewhat match the proportions of Simoncini
    Garamond, but Luciano will know more about it."

  body: "Nicola \u2014\r\n\r\nRegarding your first question:\r\n\r\n<cite> > 1. Did
    Bruce Rogers ever made a revival himself or he just \"suggested\" to make one?</cite>\r\n\r\nBruce
    Rogers was more a book designer and typographer than a type designer. He has only
    two type designs to his credit: Centaur, and the obscure Montaigne. He certainly
    never attempted a revival of Baskerville.\r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not even a case
    of him \u201Csuggesting\u201D one. \r\n\r\nBut Bruce Rogers did take a strong
    interest in Baskervilles types at that time, and he did make a discovery which
    may have encouraged at least one of the revivals.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, before he left
    England to return to America, Rogers happened upon an original Baskerville specimen
    in a Cambridge bookstall. From that, he was able to identify some types then currently
    offered by Fonderie Bertrand in France as being actually cast from the original
    Baskerville matrices.  \r\n\r\nHe had a font of these \u201Coriginal\u201D Baskerville
    types, in 14-point size, shipped to America, where he used them in several books
    he designed for the Harvard University Press.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, ATF
    had already produced its Baskerville, based on material from Stephenson, Blake
    & Co., which in turn was derived from Fry\u2019s imitations of Baskerville\u2019s
    types. So, it\u2019s not like there weren\u2019t contemporary Baskervilles already
    on the market.\r\n\r\nThe revival of a Baskerville by English Monotype came about
    in the early 1920s, about the time of Rogers\u2019s discovery of the French Baskervilles.
    It\u2019s possible that Rogers was in some direct communication with Stanley Morison
    about this, as they had some relationship. But I haven\u2019t seen any direct
    evidence that he suggested or consulted on their Baskerville or any other.\r\n\r\nHere
    is an image taken from a facsimile of one of BR\u2019s books printed in those
    14-point types cast from the original Baskerville matrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BR-Medallion_crop_3414.jpg]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis
    image (along with much of my information above) was taken from Joseph Blumenthal\u2019s
    excellent biography: <cite>Bruce Rogers: A Life in Letters</cite> [Austin: W.
    Thomas Taylor, 1989]."
