body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am cleaning up some sins done in the past, when still
  doing trial and error type design (wondering if I have advanced from this level
  until now :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a font that has ascenders as high as 800em, and descenders
  to -300, which results in an UPM-size larger than 1000, exactly 1100 EM. It is intended
  to be and drawn as a Opentype font with Postscript outlines, mainly for use in DTP
  environment (but i'd like it to be compatible with office applications if possible).
  Fontlab 5 tells me that a UPM-size other than 1000 may cause problems. \r\n\r\nI've
  done a recherche on the web and found out that there are cosmetic problems in CS1-applications
  (cursor size, ...), but could not find anything \"serious\" endangering the use
  of such a font. These postings were relatively old, the newer ones from 2007.\r\n\r\nAre
  there, in 2009, known problems for fonts with this settings? Scaling down to 1000
  is quite difficult (ugly or much work), if it is possible without problems, i'd
  like to stick with the 1100...\r\n\r\nIf there are problems to be expected: What
  happens if I set the UPM size to 1000, force the descender to -200, and still have
  glyphs that reach down to -300? Clipping? Even more dangerous things?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help\r\nSebastian Nagel"

  body: "It can cause incorrect spacing in Quark (don't know if this was fixed in
    8.0). \r\n\r\nI ran into this problem just as I was almost finished with Lakeside
    (a connecting script), which had a UPM of 1300 something (don't ask). Scaling
    it down to 1000 caused big problems for me because the x-height was quite small,
    and also messed up all the careful alignment I had done on the connecting strokes.
    My solution was to scale it up to a UPM of 2000. This still left the cursor anomaly
    in certain older Adobe apps, but it fixed the spacing problem in Quark."

  body: "I remember that at Adobe we ran into another issue with other-than-1000 upm
    fonts, that occurred when making PDFs with a \"third party\" (non Adobe) application,
    and then viewing them in *newer* versions of Acrobat/Reader (8 and 9, I think).
    It involved an area where the PDF spec might even be ambiguous, IIRC. Anyway,
    the PDFs came out with the glyphs scaled incorrectly... it was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nI
    think it's safe to say that it's nearly certain there will be further problems
    with \"some applications\" or workflows; it's just that we don't know for sure
    what those applications/workflows are, and there can even be complicated \"emergent
    problems\" from combining particular applications.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: My recommendation is that everyone should make a point of using a UPM other
    than 1000 for their CFF fonts, because the more fonts are made that way the more
    careful app developers will be about not assuming that any PS font has a UPM of
    1000!

  body: "thanks for the feedback. i'll test in xpress extensively then...\r\n\r\nit's
    a pity, scaling it to 1000 is that ugly that it would mean a lot of re-adjusting.\r\nMaybe
    i should try scaling to 2000. But let's see what xpress 7 and 8 say about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy
    other question was: What happens if I set the UPM size to 1000, force the descender
    to -200, and still have glyphs that reach down to -300, meaning being larger than
    the specified UPM? Clipping? Even more dangerous things?"

  body: "Sebastian, if you need to scale from 800 to 1000, try scaling first up to
    8000 and then down to 1000; that will avoid rounding errors.\r\n\r\nIt is okay
    to have some elements of glyphs exceed the UPM height and these will not be clipped
    so long as the OS/2 table winAscent and winDescent values equal or exceed the
    actual height of the tallest glyphs. However, you generally don't want the main
    parts of letters to exceed the UPM height, only things like cap accents."

    it to an 1100 upm TT font, and leave it. TT doesn't really care about the upm
    value and DTP/office environments use enough TT to get along. This keeps the issue
    out of Adobe's emfumbling mitts, look ma no editing, and boom done.\r\n\r\nThe
    current bottom of node/53308 states your most likely options, and it's quite simple
    if you start one of two ways... which you have not. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
