body: "I am in the midst of trying to put together my first \"font\" for notating
  a medieval style of musical notation called square note notation. My purpose is
  to be able to notate Gregorian Chant more accurately. The attached PDF gives an
  idea of how it looks. I am using FontForge.\r\n\r\nThis musical notation uses a
  four line staff. In order to facilitate input of glyphs, I am creating hundreds
  of liga/ccmp features. The number characters specify the height of the note, and
  when followed by a note type specifier character, they combine to create the notes
  at different heights. So far all of this has been a proof of concept, and in InDesign
  it works pretty well.\r\n\r\nBut I would like to make it usable in Microsoft Word.
  For the most part it works fine, but I can't get the kerning to work correctly in
  Word. Specifically, the vertical lines connecting the notes require kerning to move
  subsequent notes back up to line up to the note (see the notes over \"ta-lem\" for
  a specific example. In Word, I just can't get kerning to work, not by class, not
  manually. Yes, I've enabled kerning in Word itself, I've tried generating old style
  kerning tables, etc.\r\n\r\nMy question is this: is this probably something wrong
  with my font, or does Word not kern by glyph but by character? I've tried inserting
  the unicode glyph characters in directly, and still no kerning, but I'm just wondering
  if I'm missing something about Microsoft's kerning support...?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any advice you might have... -phatmatt"

    2003 (and earlier) don't support 'liga'. If your goal is to address as many Word

      not an absolute requirement, but I didn't think it would be a kerning problem
      that's holding me up... :-P\r\n\r\nDoes kerning by class have any part of this

  body: I never used FontForge, so I don't know how kerning is done there. In FontLab
    you can do your kerning using classes, but that doesn't mean that's how it will
    end inside the font file, since FL allows you to expand the kerning and/or implement
    the kerning in the font via the kern table instead of the kern feature (in the
    GPOS table).

    topic. I just published an OpenType font for the neumatic notation, Gregoria,
    in collaboration with a french Abbey.\r\nIt doesn\u2019t really work with MS Word
    because it extensively uses contextual alternates (and ligatures of course). I
    think it\u2019s very difficult to make it work with Word because no standards
    have been defined for this notation. But as we were also concerned by a wider
    accessibility than InDesign users, the Abbey is working on a free software to
    distribute together with the font (Gregorio), which will provide an easier user
    interface; it\u2019s almost finished.\r\nAre you also interested to make it work
    on musical softwares like Finale?\r\n\r\nAh, Gregoria has *zero* kerning pairs

    body: "Elena, I might be just as surprised as you! I only knew of the Meinrad
      fonts (and another one from Germany...by the fellow who created the Night Office
      recebtly...can't remember the name of it now). I was very happy to see your
      font, and I really like the shape of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nI was originally working
      on a software only project (in C#) that used a GUI to create the notation (I
      was a software engineer by training, not a typeface designer!). But I realized
      that a proprietary system to notate it was just not as flexible as utilizing
      DTP software already. I hadn't gotten as far as Finale, though Finale integration
      would make it much more usable I imagine...\r\n\r\nI was hoping to keep Word
      compatibility enough to not require a seperate tool to notate it. But then again,
      I am not employing nearly as many neat 'calt's as you: (e.g., to specify a connecting
      line requires two height indicators, the start and the end).\r\n\r\nHow do your
      lines connect without any kerning? The puntums have to be pushed back to overlap
      a little bit, don't they? Or, now that I am looking at the PDF spec sheet for
      your font, do you simply not overlap the line with the punctum? Except for the
      podatus, I don't see another neume that has an interval of a fifth...\r\n\r\nThanks
      for your message... It's great to see your project. -B. Matthew"

  body: "B., thank you for your comments.\r\nTraditional western musical notation
    is covered by the unicode \"symbols\" range from U+1D100 to U+1D1FF:\r\nunicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf\r\n
    \r\nAt the beginning I considered of course using the standard and following the
    same process of the musical fonts I saw, which use components (noteheads + bars)
    to obtain the notes. The advantage of this method is *not* to consider the vertical
    position of the notes (which determines the pitch) in order to let the different
    musical softwares taking care of it. It is not considered as a technical limitation
    but as a feature of the encoding because it insures compatibility, since the elements
    encoded behave as characters (and not as glyphs...)\r\n\r\nBut as in our case
    the need was to work on layout applications (such as InDesign), for internal use
    and quality publications, this way resulted very complicated and tedious: combine
    a series of 5-numbers unicodes to obtain the neumes (sometimes quite clumsy in
    the way the elements join to make what originally is a single sign), use a script
    to adjust the position of the note on the stave (that has to be drawn separately)
    and switch font to enter liquescences, rhythmical signs, pauses, keys and anything
    else...\r\n\r\nWe tried instead to experiment a different system with the available
    font technology, opentype, to find an easy solution, practical and faster to type.
    \ Gregoria includes all the possible combinations at every height (there are 13
    heights): the lines of the stave are integrated in every glyphs and spaces.\r\nAll
    the glyphs and spaces are modular to insure a plain rhythm and a constant line
    length... instead of thousand of kerning pairs it uses alternates glyphs with
    different left side-bearings.\r\n\r\nHow do you deal with the stave lines or vertical
    position in your font?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nElena\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Elena,\r\n\r\nI am using ligatures to map the notes to the different height
      positions, much like your method. My height characters are different (0-9 covers
      the standard range, and other characters provide the higher and lower vertical
      positions), but the idea is the same. 'p' is a punctum cuadratum, so ligatures
      0p, 5p, Ap, etc. map to the punctum at different height values. 'P' maps to
      a podatus, and usually uses two height values: 35P, etc. A 'P' with only one
      height indicator only places the top of the podatus, which in my font is a little
      skinnier and a bit more curved underneath.\r\n\r\nMany of the other single height
      glyphs (oriscus, punctum inclinatum, virga, first symbol of the clivis, etc.)
      follow the same pattern as the punctum. The porrectus is implemented like the
      podatus.\r\n\r\nThen all of these can be connected using lines. The lines are
      specified using two height indicators like the podatus and porrectus, and I'm
      using kerning to adjust spacing. I was hoping to make the lines automatic using
      'calt's, but I'm pretty new at creating any sort of typefaces, so I'm just trying
      to get it usable first.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was going to use non spacing characters
      for the staff, and have the neumes be composed of seperate glyphs on top. This
      would allow for different colored stave lines, but it seemed to be more of a
      hassle to consistently input glyphs. Besides, different colored stave lines
      is not really a high priority for me. Right now I just have a few stave line
      characters of multiple widths. I was originally going to make all the glyphs
      have consistent widths, but I'd prefer to keep the spacing more fluid if possible.
      To create consistent line lengths, I was considering using special line terminator
      glyphs that would be inserted at right-aligned tab marks and overlap with the
      glyphs before it. But I haven't finished this much yet.\r\n\r\nBut really I'm
      just doing this because, like John Hudson above, I just like singing and praying
      with Gregorian chant!\r\n\r\n-B. Matthew\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm glad to see people working on Gregorian notation fonts. This is something
    I toyed with a couple of years ago, but I never had time to pursue it. My idea
    was specifically linked to an input method I was spec'ing which would allow the
    user to ender a neume type (single punctum, clivis, podatus, etc.) and then use
    number or cursor keys  to assign the first note to a particular line of the staff.
    I never got further than making some notes though because of other projects that
    needed my attention. So I figure I'll just sing the stuff and someone else can
    look after the typesetting :)

  body: "As a follow up, here's what's going on that was frustrating my kerning attempts.
    I'm using Windows Vista, MS Office 2007, and InDesign.\r\n\r\nThe first problem
    seemed to be that fonts were getting cached by windows, so kerning changes weren't
    showing up in the applications correctly. This thread was what alerted me to it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/15633\r\n\r\nI
    followed the advice to simply change the font name on significant builds, at least
    while I'm developing. If anybody else has better advice, I'd love to hear it.
    (BTW, I do have the new WPF font cache service in Vista disabled).\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    it seems there was something that by reassigning the language/script settings
    did the trick (thanks for the tip Sergey). I don't know if it was a fontforge
    mistake or my own, but kerning kind of works now (see below).\r\n\r\nI know I
    said that MS Word 2007 supports 'liga', but I noticed an interesting thing happening.
    As I was fixing errors reported by MS Font Validator, the 'liga's stopped working
    in Word 2007. It seems that if my font has a double quote glyph (0x22 I believe)
    the 'liga's don't work. If I remove that glyph from the font, the 'liga's work.
    Surely there's something going on underneath the hood (Word interpreting the font
    as a different script/lang maybe), surely I'm hacking things, but I still found
    it interesting. If anybody wants two hacked fonts, one that works with 'liga's
    in Word 2007 the other not, I can try to reproduce the issue. I don't know how
    any of this relates to earlier versions of Word.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Word
    doesn't seem to do the kerning correctly for 'liga's. It seems to use the kerning
    information for the first character rather than for the 'liga' glyph (using the
    unicode glyph itself works fine, but that kind of defeats the wole purpose of
    what I'm trying to do anyway). So after all that trying to simply fix kerning,
    it seems like MS Word support might be unreasonable anyway. I guess I should stop
    hacking and just make the font right anyway. :-P\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help/advice.
