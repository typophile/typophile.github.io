    Writing_ by A.N. Palmer before almost all business writing became typewritten.

  body: "hi ryuk, thanks for your 'stubborness' :-)\r\n\r\nit is the only sample i
    have, and as i said, business penmanship is really close... it is just a little
    lighter, and the lower case 'e' has a 'flick' that is missing on the image sample...
    there is also an obvious loop on the 'r', and the dot on the 'i' is hollow"

  body: "I think Ryuk is still right: The flick of |e| as well as the loop of |r|
    and the hollow dot of |i| are probably disappeared due to the low resolution of
    your image.\r\nThe font suggested by Ryuk seems like an exact match."

  body: "There are still people who can write in Palmer style, and other variations
    of Spencerian Script, with such regularity that it is difficult to spot differences
    in repeating letter combinations. Consider the following example from the fountain
    pen network in 2012 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpencerianBusinessWritingInUse@fountainpennetwork20120715_6530.jpg]\r\nI
    trust it would be possible for a penman to produce an exact duplicate of your
    sample.\r\nDon"
