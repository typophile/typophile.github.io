  came up - that Liberation Sans is a bad copy of a bad copy of a typeface. We had
  a nice laugh and progressed with the beer drinking, but that comment stuck with
  me.\r\n\r\nNow, this being a board with heaps of people who know their type, I'm
  wondering - what's the general feeling towards this family of typefaces?"
