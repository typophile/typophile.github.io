body: "Has anybody here hinted for cleartype?\r\n\r\nWould you be willing to describe
  how it is the same as & how it differs from hinting for true type? Also, does anybody
  know if it is  basically the same hinting data? So for example - if it is the same
  data, then theoretically you cannot have a font hinted for both true type & clear
  type at the same time without making a compromise in each. Correct? ( Or making
  two fonts - hinted one way & another one hinted the other way). \r\n\r\nAlso any
  hints about a baseline setup in terms of equipment & software would be good to know
  about too. I was thinking of buying a LCD screen to replace my CRT but I want to
  make sure it will be useful for checking my hinting. I think you need a minimum
  ppi of 120+ or so. Correct? Since the ppi shifts on monitors now alot what is a
  good strategy if you are not going to buy 3 reference monitors? ( check your enighbor's?)\r\n\r\nIf
  I am not mistaken all the talk on typophile about cleartype so far has been in reaction
  to it rather than talking about how to do it. Did I miss somehing?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n "

    if it is the same data, then theoretically you cannot have a font hinted for both
    true type & clear type at the same time without making a compromise [to one or
    the other].\"\r\n\r\nI think that's what you mean....?"

  body: "Yes. That's what I meant. True type hinting is geared to b/w bitmaps and
    is somewhat heavy handed at times where as ClearType hinting would be softer -
    so the hinting (if it is the same data source) could probably not do double duty.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think you could talk to your fellow hinters a bit & see what they say?\r\n\r\nI
    have been sent a little info too which I will post here soon."

  body: "I have and if you are manually hinting with Microsoft's Visual TrueType there
    are 2 things you can do. \r\n\r\nIt helps to have the ClearType version of VTT
    and know how to do low level TrueType.\r\n\r\nYou need to check the rasterizer
    with code to see if 'you are in ClearType'. This is a standard function in the
    'fpgm' that VTT has and what you need to do is do the same thing as is done for
    Greyscale checking in VTT's function 84. \r\n\r\nThen in the glyph's instruction
    that you would like to alter you would have to use low level TrueType to call
    function 77. That is the function used in VTT for binary or grey scale delta hints.
    \r\n\r\nBy adding to function 84 and copying the same method that VTT does for
    Grey and using the GETINFO instruction and the value 8192 instead of 4096 for
    grey, you can hint for grey, binary or CT. \r\n\r\nAlso CT ignors Delta hints.
    You can force it to not ignores them by sticking this in the 'prep'\r\n\r\n/*
    \ use Deltas in ClearType */\r\n#PUSHOFF\r\n#PUSH, 4, 3\r\nINSTCTRL[]\r\n#PUSHON\r\n\r\nthis
    is a bit dangerous because most Deltas are for Grey or binary.\r\n\r\nvincent\r\n"

    lightly hint a font with ClearType in mind, taking advantage of sub-pixel spacing
    as well as rendering - the ClearType Collection approach. But if you then decide
    that b/w rendering is important you can add contextual non-CT hints to improve
    the b/w rendering, but in the cases I''ve seen the spacing suffers under b/w even
    if the bitmaps are nice.   '

    A cheapy laptop might be a good basic investment if you don't have one already.
    To be honest I wouldn't spend anything until you're up to speed with VTT - if
    you can't get there perhaps CT hinting is not a good hobby.\r\n\r\nSi "

  body: "Also as Si said hinting for CT is 'light' hinting. The hints in the Y direction
    are used and in the X direction they are not for the most part. Many people hinting
    for CT are hinting in Y and not doing much in X. \r\n\r\nAlso it's not worth spending
    too much time messing around with tweaking for a specific CT display (such as
    the normal CT mode in VTT). You don't know what kind of CT display the font will
    be used on.  Or has the user tweaked their CT settings? Is the display horizontal
    or vertical? Is it a tablet PC ?\r\n\r\nGenerally all I've done is address some
    problems that CT creates such as diagonals have a tendancy to become heavy (as
    apposed to in Grey they are light). Some stems like the Capital H, I , L maybe
    light or heavy because they have a sub pixel that is darker than others. In these
    cases I use function 77 in the glyphs local instructions to move the outline.
    Function 77 acts like a delta hint and moves a point through a range of sizes.
    it checks a flag that is set by function 84 to see what mode the rasterizer is
    in. If we are in CT then the exception is processed. \r\n\r\n\r\nvincent\r\n"

  body: "\"True type hinting is geared to b/w bitmaps and is somewhat heavy handed\"\r\n\r\nWell,
    the hints are the same in TT and CT, as you know 'tis one hinting language...\r\n\r\nThe
    two rasterizers use incongruent theories of pixel recognition and don't interpret
    the hints the same. I find the whole CT activities list to be wanting from the
    failure to recognize an important typographic principle of low resolution being:
    that you can't hint parts of a font (safely) any more than you can stop part of
    a train, (safely). But they will try.\r\n\r\nAnd, \"don't worry\" about spacing
    'cause there is nothing you can do about it, MS's \"quadrupled\" the resolution
    and \"solved\" that problem, meaning you can't even control it if you want to...;)
    But VC's comments are, though masking some bias, accurate. E.G. when he says the
    diagonals get heavy, he's right!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    MS Typography recently with templates files. I started working with \"Prepare
    font\" option - so all templates were imported in the font including the Font
    Program. I only entered my cvt's with cvt-deltas, so the font program and prep
    programs are not manually changed (I tried but not cuccessfully to modify definition
    of function 84). When I use greyscale-only deltas (right-click and drag) all works
    properly (CALL to function 76), but cleartype-only deltas are displayed only in
    VTT Talk and Glyph program (CALL to function 77) without any visual result - I
    think they will work when function 84 will ask and report selector of cleartype
    rasterizer (now it is asking about greyscale and report 32 selector). \r\n\r\nSo
    I simply don't know how to change this definition of 84 function - it must ask
    about rasterizer and report rasterizer's selector when CALL to function 77 is
    working.  Or maybe I don't understand this question correctly."
