  body: "An illustration for a publication project about H&FJ and some of their former
    students. I can\u2019t really afford to license too many expensive fonts right
    now, so I\u2019m going with fonts by Jos to have a look that will be distinct
    from the work of the New England type design crowd."

  body: I like it James. It's nice to see that the little shurikens are pieces of
    text after all. Looks like an awfull lot of work btw.

  body: "These things come out faster than one might expect. It\u2019s all math, and
    because 360 is divisible by a great many other numbers it stays relatively simple.
    Of course, I have a head for systematic stuff and I know guys who would go insane
    even trying to work this out."
