body: I found free font on some web site with this clipart as dingbat, but then my
  computer broke and my hard disk erased all my data. So i tried to find that font
  again, nut only thing I found is font called KR Rachel's Elephants. It contains
  this elephant, but it has too low resolution... And the font i used to have, had
  the same picture of elephant but with much more details and better resolution. The
  clipart picture is in attachment. I hope anyone could help me find this font or
  have more detailed picture.... Thx :D
