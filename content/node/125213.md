body: 'I have a loan document that was created in November 1991 by an attorney using
  an early Apple or McIntosh computer, probably a Mac SE. The computer is long gone
  and my attorney passed away in 2006. I think he was using some sort of business
  form software created for Apple. The type face in question is identical to Tahoma
  but Tahoma was not introduced until 1994. I''m told that Tahoma is a knock off of
  several other fonts that were in use decades ago and may have been created by Susan
  Kare or Adrian Fruitiger. Can anyone confirm my suspicions or has anyone used that
  early business form software I am referring to? Your help is appreciated. Sincerely,
  Tom  '

  body: "Your sample is not much to go on. It would be helpful if you could post more
    example characters than this.\r\n\r\nIt does look like Tahoma, but I am not aware
    of any typefaces older than Tahoma that would be this close. Whoever told you
    Tahoma was a knockoff was wrong. Your sample does not match any Frutiger fonts
    that I know of, and Susan Kare only designed bitmapped fonts for Apple. Tahoma
    resembles older typefaces in only the most superficial sense.\r\n\r\nIn November
    1991, TrueType fonts were very new. Among the initial set of TrueType fonts that
    Apple shipped, none looked much like Tahoma. (The fonts were Times, Helvetica,
    Courier, and TrueType versions of Kare's earlier bitmapped fonts Geneva, New York,
    Chicago, and Monaco.)"

  body: Thanks Igor. I was busy. The point from me is not that these two faces, designed
    a decade apart for the same general purpose, don't look alike to us, but rather
    that they would be not be very distiguishable to most. So, someone who has become
    familiar with Tahoma, and has barely ever seen Geneva, might look at Geneva and
    think it Tacoma. That's all.

    body: "One of the biggest problems with Stiehl is that he uses a very pejorative
      word, \u201Cforgery,\u201D in a completely inappropriate way. Part of the meaning
      of forgery is, yes, producing a copy of something. But the other part, what
      makes it \u201Cbad,\u201D is passing it off as the original. A forgery is claimed
      to be the thing it is imitating. This does not, in general, happen with fonts.
      Everyone agrees that Dutch 801 is imitating Times (New) Roman; Bitstream never
      took Dutch 801 and labeled it as Times New Roman to sell it as the original.
      So \u201Cforgery\u201D is a totally inappropriate word to use, in English.\r\nIt
      is as if somebody made by hand a copy of the Mona Lisa, clearly labeled it as
      a copy/imitation, and somebody else accused them of forgery just because they
      imitated it. Utter nonsense."

    giant European house cat, originally bred in the Fr\xFC province of northern Italy.
    You can read all about it on the website I launched in 1873. Y'all must know it
    to be true because, in over 125 Saturnian years, no one's ever sued me. People
    only get sued if they lie, or no, if they don't get sued they must be telling
    the truth. Forgers, smugglers, the vipers Vanguard, Uli jungle fever! Batman help
