It's funny, I researched a lot some time ago, so I can provide the common recommendations of the espresso forums in D for perfect italian moments (best in combination with a really good coffee mill):

- Oscar Nuova Simonelli (robust and good coffee)
- a little more expensive: Bezzera BZ 99 (more shiny, also good coffee)
- much more expensive: La Cimbali junior (... sigh ...)</div>

If I want a quick, but still fairly good coffee, I use a  [[http://www.dejuistekeus.nl/images/philips_hdsenseotitanium.jpg|Philips Senseo]] machine with coffee-pads.

But the coffee grinder is really essential. And of course the coffee, which I think has to be tested with the machine. There are huge differences how the same coffee tastes when brewed with a different machine. With Bialetti Brikka e.g. 100% Arabica coffee is too subtle. And the coffee shouldn't be too old.

		<div class="commentbody">It's only from a purist's view and it's based on the steam developed while brewing coffee: 
"Common" Bialettis produce a beverage called "mokka", with Brikka it's a bit different because of the special valve. Here the steam is accumulating until the vapor pressure has reached 6 bar. Big espresso machines generally reach more (ca. 10) bar, which results in a better "crema".
To complicate things even more: oriental coffee brewed in a little pitcher (boiled up 3 times, with lots of sugar and a little cardamom, no accumulating of steam) is also called mokka.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a very interesting subject. At my desk I have a Senseo coffee pod machine. Not bad, not great.

In the studio we have the Keurig k-cup system. Better, but still not great. I have chosen to use the Keurig system because I have found a distributor that sells a 25-serving box of Jet Fuel by Coffee People $10.95. Keeps me from spending $$$$ at the local coffee shop (It's a Grind).

However, I spoke with a kind gentleman at Peet's Coffee. I wanted to intall the Miele espresso machine with warming drawer in my home. I love the beautiful lines and would hate to have yet another appliance sitting on my countertop. He informed me to stay away from the Swiss and German espresso machines. (Breaks my heart as I am of 100% German/Swiss descent) He gave me this list of names for great coffee makers:
Gaggia
La Marzocco
Livia
La Pavoni
(all Italian brands)

If you're really a coffee snob, you would do the French press route with extremely cold filtered water, freshly ground beans, heat the water to the precise temp, brew the coffee for the required time period, plunge enjoy. Then there are some that would say the remaining coffee is too bitter because it is still technically brewing and won't be the same as the first cup.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To avoid drinking too much coffee, and to make a bit of a ritual of each cup, I use a manual one-cup drip cone, pouring the boiling water into it very slowly making sure to keep all the grounds constantly submerged. The coffee itself is Nabob Full City Dark Roast. No doubt not the best brew in the world, but I like it and it's better than Tim Hortons any day. Being a one-man office, this system works fine.</div>

My favourite so far is Yemen Matari.

I roast it, grind it up, pour boiling water on it and filter it.

At my office? They took the machine (which actually grinds the coffee on the spot and  makes a decent cup)out 'cuase of renovations, so it's Tim Hortons, since there's no decent coffee shops where my office is. </div>

I use to be a real coffee drinker - but not anymore. My stepson uses a machine and coffee by Gevalia. Anyone here use it to? He swears by it. http://www.gevalia.com/Gevalia/

I remember steamed coffee, sock coffee, perculator coffee, the coffee that you boil the water in the lower pot, it rises and when you gave the color you want, turn the gas off and let it drip back down coffee, oh let's not forget drip coffee - where would we have been without our Melitas? and then in the early 1980s I discovered the press - and kept using that. If it was good enough for Hemingway - the it is good enough for me!</div>

Your guru is right!

		<div class="commentbody">I use the Melitta one-cup drip cone too, like James. I work at home and have a tiny kitchen. If I had more counter space I'd get an espresso machine - there's a Krups a friend has that I like. I hate old coffee so whatever I use it has to be made fresh. Don't like the french press because it gets grainy.

For coffee I use a dark roast, Italian or French. I make it super strong and while the water is boiling for the coffee I warm up some milk, so it's almost a latte. I get my beans at Fairway or at Gorilla Coffee in Brooklyn which gives you a free cup of coffee if you buy a pound of beans. I grind them myself using a little Krups grinder.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've got two old reliables . . .

1) Jura-Capresso Z6 Super Automatic (got a nice license deal and decided to treat myself) - Loaded with Starbucks Espresso blend of half regular and half decaf - Tip: Buy Starbucks beans only from Starbucks free standing stores, not in Target Starbucks, the beans are drownding in oils to further preserve shelf life at retail chains.

Machine is mostly used for Cappucinos and Americanos (and Frothed Milk + NesQuick for Hot Cocoa for the Kiddos)

2) Starbucks Barista Thermal Mug Machine - When I'm in the mood for good old fashioned drip, this machine honestly makes better coffee than my Krups and keeps it hot right in the mug it drips in for like half the day. Also, Starbucks House Blend or Breakfast Blend.

It should be noted we have acquired a near collection of coffee machines ranging from 1950s percolators to vacuum pots to Senseo and so fourth . . . I worked at Gloria Jeans during my college years and became a coffee snob once I knew better . . . BTW, there is no finer coffee on a week long fishing trip in Canada than propane fired perk with the grounds sunk at the bottom . . . It's horrible and I love it!

Of course my reply is going on but there is something so very simple and complex about coffee machines that is just appealing to me in a gadgety way. It's just steeping near boiling water over ground beans but like toasters or mouse traps, there are like a billion ways to do it . . . I'm always pleased with new ideas on a very old process . . .

I have always been leery of Starbucks. When I was last living in NYC (up to 1999) there were several lawsuits against Starbucks. I don't know how they fanned out - but...

1. One of the early 1990s years - they sold more Hawaaian Kona Beans then Hawaai produced that year;

and

I've spent big bucks on Intelligencia and enjoyed many pots 'o Eight O Clock but at the end of the day, I have no problem patronozing Starbucks since my latte factor has dropped at least 400% from buying $4 crappucinos from poorly trained baristas to about .25¢ per cappucino making it at home of course with their beans . . .

Too true. I share a beach house with a finicky couple who have polar opposite taste in coffee. She likes hers dark and strong and he likes his to taste like it came from a diner (ick). So we need two machines, two different coffees. Her coffee is understandably more popular although at times it tastes like it can take the paint off your car. Then there's a third guy in the house who inexplicably likes his coffee made in a percolator. This ups the ante to three machines. It's absurd. If we had to license our coffee per machine like fonts we'd be paying thru the nose ;-)</div>

Mornings start with a French press of freshly ground fair-trade Sumatran dark.

In the afternoon I'll either pop out for an espresso or make Turkish coffee. If I have twenty minutes free (ha!) I'll hand-grind the beans for the latter, but otherwise I use the very excellent coffee from Kurukahveci Mehmet Effendi & Sons in Istanbul.

For French press coffee, you want a very coarse grind to prevent small bits of coffee grounds getting through the press filter. Blade grinders are ideal for this (in fact, it's the only thing they're good for: they don't grind nearly fine enough for espresso or moka (e.g. Turkish coffee)). I give one short burst on a blade grinder for each spoonful of coffee beans (usually five for a full-size pot): that breaks the coffee up enough to release the flavour, but not enough to produce much 'silt'. There will always be a small amount of powder, no matter how coarse the grind, but that shouldn't bother you.

Mind you, I like Turkish coffee, so finding a small mudslide in the bottom of my cup isn't an issue.</div>

And yeah, the silt (not to mention the messy press) is why I gave up on the french press. Was it in a William Gibson novel that a Columbian character pointed out that the French know nothing about coffee? Anyway, whoever wrote it was right—they can cook a mean duck over there, but the French really need to just replace their entire coffee infrastructure with stuff from Lavazza.</div>

It's fascinating to watch the coffee being made: like a French press process on steroids and amphetamines, and I like the way the grounds are pressed out of the top of the machine to be scraped off. I've only bothered with it once, though, because there always seems to be a much more attractive espresso machine standing nearby...</div>

And thanks a lot for the link to the little film!

I think that the price is one of the reasons why the nuova simonelli oscar (smallest dual circuit, i.e. separate circuits for coffee and steam) is so popular in the forums in this country: it's available for approximately the same (original) amount as the iPhone - only that it's not that good looking ... ;o)

Meanwhile I found out that brewing good espresso in the home/office has pleasantly reduced the amount of money I tended to carry to my favorite coffee spot in town -- I had a small swiss machine which gave up after 3 years and then, after some hints and experiments, found out how to get good stuff out of the Brikka. But I have to admit, that in future planning there is one of these chrome machines twinkling at me, with lots of coffee capacity for visiting friends, colleagues, clients, ... :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At home I have a pretty crappy drip machine with a hotplate that will burn the coffee if you leave it in the pot for too long. But then, I also use Maxwell House in it, so it doesn't much matter. 

My other coffee-makers are: one of those tiny stove top things -- but now that I no longer have a gas stove it's not so great -- and a Bodum French press which I really like, but am terribly lazy about cleaning out afterwards. In the Bodum I use good coffee. My more recent forays have been "Kick Ass" made by Kicking Horse, which is fair trade.

I like my coffee overly strong, and I have no problem with the silt. If it's not there I sorta think something's missing. My inlaws make incredibly weak (coloured water) coffee. Something like half a spoon of coffee for every two cups. Ew. I always have to remember when they visit to make it "their way". When they're over I make two pots -- the maxwell house crap and my bodum. 

At work, I have no desk space, but I tried one of those one cup drip machines. Problem was it splattered, and made such a mess. Communal coffee pots just don't work in our office -- I even have problems even keeping a small carton of cream in the fridge. It either spoils or gets finished by other people (thieves!). So it's downstairs to Timmy's Ho for me, twice a day. I've actually grown to like it. Somehow it fits the work environment just so well. Every once in a while I get a paper cup that is leaking at the seam, and it makes the morning all the more enjoyable. ;) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the aeropress--yes, I have one and it's excellent. I'd highly recommend it, though it takes some calibration before you get the timing and proportions right. But once you get your routine, it makes great Moka-type espresso. I sometimes dilute it to make Americano.

I used to use a [[http://chemexcoffeemaker.com/|Chemex manual drip coffeemaker]]. Now I just use the Aeropress (and a French press when I'm in the mood for unfiltered coffee). Although the Chemex makes better drip coffee than any automatic drip machine I've had, it's still drip coffee. I prefer a small, strong cup of coffee (or espresso) to a weak pitcher of drip coffee.

Fresh-roasted beans make a huge difference, as long as you grind them just before you make the coffee. There's no comparison between beans roasted yesterday and beans roasted 6 months ago (that "expire" in another year). Check with a local independent coffee shop: they probably buy their beans from someone local.</div>

As I understand (from Greek friends), prior to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in the 1970s 
even the Greek called this drink 'Turkish coffee'.

The addition of cardomom is typically Arabic: you can buy Arabic blends with the cardomom already added. I've noticed that the Arabic, Bosnian and Romanian varieties tend to be a darker roast. I prefer the Turkish and Greek brands, which are a medium roast and don't require as much sugar.</div>

At home: a Rancilio Silvia with a Gaggia grinder; beans by http://www.hasbean.com (no, really). 
At work: a trusty biggish old Krupps that will do the requisite 15 bar; OTC ground Lavazza. 
In the garage: a La Pavoni Europiccola, disused after it blew the 1500W toroidal transformer that was powering it.
In my ears: she-of-impeccable-nutrition reminding me I'll do my ticker in.

At Dalton Maag we use my old Krups, and at home I have another similar to this but at home I use a single cup gold filtered thing like a Melita. Continentals use the espresso with no milk, I use it like a very large 3-4 cup cappuccino. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Braun Coffeemaker
(I have the Aromaster KF420 which they don't make any more. It brews great coffee and is an ergonomic marvel.) Get an inexpensive 10 cup: it's better to brew fresh coffee more often than to drink old muddy coffee. As with any coffeemaker, turn it off after it finishes brewing, unless you want your coffee cooked and bitter. Reheat leftover cups in a microwave. New Braun 10 cup model KF510 in white or black, $30 at [[ http://www.amazon.com/Braun-KF510-WH-AromaDeluxe-10-Cup-Coffeemaker/dp/B00006JL0A|Amazon (White only)]]with free shipping. ($35-50 elsewhere)

Krups 203 Coffee Grinder (in white or black); about $20
Works great; other grinders make a mess.

Try Kenya AA (“excellent body, heady aroma, very little bitterness”) or Ethiopian Yirgacheffe  (“distinctive floral bouquet, rich body, a pleasingly fragrant aroma, with a smooth mellowness”) if you haven’t already. Best coffee prices online are at [[http://www.freshcoffee.net|California Coffee Roasters.]] A five pound bag is $30 + shipping.</div>
