    upside down and backwards! Common practice in my world!!\r\n\r\nI do not recognize
    the pen, send the video to John Neal and he will be able to tell you and probably
    sell you more than you need. There are a number of fiber pens that are really
    nice. I use the Speedball Elegant Writer all the time for roughs. I believe it
    is the toughest \"point\" going. Therein lies the rub. Most of the pens give up
    the ghost after a half an hour. They go mushy. Haven't come up with Viagra for
    the bad ones.\r\n\r\nHey, I will be out of town for a while and won't be able
    to access Typophile.  I think I may be able to get e-mail in case you need to
    set up travel for TypeCon.\r\n\r\nSee ya soon. All the best.\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n"
