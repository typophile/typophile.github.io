body: "Attached photos are from a volume of Hubert Howe Bancroft's history of western
  North America.  The series was published by subscription from 1883-1890 in 39 volumes,
  and the fonts used on all volumes are the same, so the font(s) we're looking for
  would have to have been available over that timespan.  Place of publication was
  San Francisco.  All appear to be in some form of Oldstyle, but they don't seem to
  correlate to anything I've seen in BB&S, ATF or McGrew.  Title (Bancroft's Works)
  is about 5.5mm, which I estimate to be 20pt.  The series volume and subtitle are
  about 4mm (12pt?).  The volume and date on the last line of the bottom label appear
  to be a shorter, expanded version of the same font, and height is about 2.5mm.\r\n\r\nThe
  noteworthy features of the two primary fonts are the curve of the capital R; the
  absence of any serif on the center peak of the W; and the parallel legs of the M.
  \ More contemporary oldstyle fonts don't combine all three of these characteristics.\r\n\r\nExcuse
  me if my terminology is amateur, as I'm still relatively new to this.  Also pardon
  me if this message seems to have been posted in substantially similar form twice,
  \ I think I lost the first one due to operator error.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    they used a similar font on the title pages of the books?

    body: I'll try to get clearer photos tomorrow.  The fonts used on the title pages
      and in the book's contents appear to be one or more Roman fonts.  They're not
      the same as the cover labels.  Thanks for helping.

    to "oldstyle", only that it's a light weight font. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0423_4962.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN0424_5570.JPG]

  body: Another consideration.  Everything here is either caps or numbers.  It's possible
    that this was a Titling font in 18pt and 10pt.

  body: "To my eye, this is a version of a font usually then called French Old Style
    in English speaking countries and was sold as an Elzevir in Europe -- the term
    Elzevir lumped it together with Dutch fonts of the 17th century. French Old Style
    is an extremely thin style of font designed by Th\xE9ophile Beaudoire in 1858.
    The upper case is derived from Louis Perrin's Lyon Capitals. There is no available
    digital font, that matches French Old Style, but J.P. Knox has been working on
    a digital revival of its European predecessor for many years under the name of
    Marquet Titling.\r\nHere is a sample of his work\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MarquetTitlingByJPKnoxInUse_5771.jpg]\r\nwhich
    is almost identical to the book binding letters. The spurred _G_ and _R_ with
    the tapered curved leg are essentially the same letter-forms as the book binding
    letters. Other versions of French Old Style have an _M_ with vertical sides and
    a _W_ with no spurs at the vertex.\r\nFurther information at http://typophile.com/node/108094\r\nAs
    for substitutes to match the book binding letters, as I mentioned above no version
    of French Old Style has been digitized.\r\nLoosely similar fonts include Louize
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nonpareille/louize/ but it's too heavy and is only
    a partial match, and Romana http://www.myfonts.com/search/romana but again too
    heavy and an even poorer match.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Bob. I first noticed this font a few years ago when paging through
    some 19th century books at a local university library and noting how different
    the tone was to modern books. So I decided to track it down using the old specimen
    books.\r\nDon"

  body: "First off, thanks to all of you\u2014especially Don\u2014who have provided
    input on this.  Let me re-focus this discussion a little.  My desire is to identify
    the ORIGINAL font used and if at all possible, to use moveable type from that
    font to reproduce the labels on these 39 volumes.  (I know that\u2019s a tall
    order.)  If and when it becomes obvious that that is impossible, I may seek a
    digital solution.  For the record, the most pleasing digital fonts I have seen
    are Paratype \u201CNeva\u201D and (surprisingly) Microsoft\u2019s Yu Mincho Light.
    \ (Neva was identified via Identifont.)\r\nFrench Old Style has been on my radar
    screen for some time as a likely match.  Reviewing old specimen books from BB&S,
    Inland, ATF, Linotype and Intertype as well as McGrew\u2019s catalog of 20th Century
    types, I have not found a good match under French Old Style or any other Old Style,
    Bookman, Booklet, Lightface, Clearface or other.  Most of these have serifs at
    the apex of the W and M\u2019s with slanted legs, and few have the curved leg
    on the R.  None has all three.  Specimens for many of the possible matches don\u2019t
    include all of these letters, which hampers comparison.  My hope was that one
    of you might have access to 19th century specimen books that I don\u2019t and
    could find it that way.\r\nBancroft and his brother operated the printshop that
    published these books from the early 1860\u2019s through at least the 1890\u2019s
    in San Francisco.  You may have seen my other post for a font that I believe was
    based on Bauer Gable.  What I didn\u2019t mention is that that book, published
    in Missouri in 1894, used what I believe to be this same typeface on its title
    page.  Don\u2019s posts to date (in this and other message threads) suggest that
    French Old Style or Elzevir was designed in 1858, adapted by others, and widely
    used in Europe and America through the last half of the century, and finally fell
    out of favor near the turn of the century.  Because I can trace use to printers
    in SF and Missouri who made a lot of books in this timeframe, my guess is that
    it was being made or imported and distributed by a major player in the type business
    in this timeframe.  I\u2019m too new at this to know who that might have been,
    but I think that\u2019s the direction to look in\u2014specimen books from major
    foundries and importers who might have been selling type west of the Mississippi
    during this timeframe to significant book printing shops.  Were Lyon Capitals,
    Beaudoire\u2019s French Old Style or any of the European derivatives being imported
    to America in a big way?\r\nAgain, thanks to all for your help.\r\nBill S\r\n"

  body: Gold hot foil stamping will require metal type if you want to reproduce the
    labels close to the  originals. Finding something close maybe be hard so you should
    check the letterpress printing newsgroups. Photo polymer plates I don't think
    will work for stamping foil but those can be used for a printed paper label. Most
    hand bookbinders have some types for foil stamping in my experience, but only
    one or two.

  body: "Another possibility that might work. Find a suitable digital font, convert
    it to eps and/or whatever format can be read by a digital printer. Have 3D printing
    service produce a thermal tolerant mold used to cast a metal plate suitable for
    hot foil stamping. It's at least worth exploring this concept.\r\nDon"

  body: "Bill I wish you luck on a search for a specimen book from the mid 1890s with
    a match.\r\nSome books have not only survived, but are digitally available at
    Archive org or HATHI. Unfortunately most are from the ATF combine, or Inland.
    Of these ATF Pacific Blue is worth a close check. But there is nothing digital
    from Bruce, Connors, BB & S or other foundries of the early to mid 1890s. \r\nI
    note you are in California. A visit to the University of Cailfornia might turn
    up something in the rare books collection. Some of the best digital specimen books
    at Archive Org are from that source. Best to check several UC locations.  \r\nFor
    purchase of a specimen book E-bay, Abe books, Amazon and Google could be explored
    for leads. \r\nFinally, just because a font was used by a publisher in 1894 doesn't
    mean that it was a new font. Parsimony is the name of the game in book publishing
    then as now and some less frequently used fonts could have been many years old.\r\nI
    am not clear from your remarks whether you do letterpress printing yourself. If
    you do, ignore the rest of this paragraph. ... If you can identify a font by name
    that you think would work you can then attempt to purchase it. My observation
    from casual visits to letterpress websites is that there is an active market for
    letter press fonts. Some old some new. And there are advice and trading forums
    on the internet.\r\nAs for technique, Bob's suggestion seems good. Again I expect
    your attempt is not unique and some internet digging could be helpful.\r\nI wish
    you good luck on achieving a satisfying outcome.\r\nDon\r\n"
