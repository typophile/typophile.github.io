  body: "I think the S is more closed than Avenir's, but not as much as Helvetica/Arial.
    With that said, these letters are not the best for ID purposes, because there
    may be too many candidates. Maybe that's the good news, because it would be hard
    to prove them wrong.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of argument I will pick [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=406034&grab_id=0&page_id=35232&query=Felbridge&SCOPE=Fonts|Felbridge
    Bold]] and say that it would match if you just widened it a bit. The truth is
    it could probably be many fonts, with no other letters for comparison.\r\n\r\n-
