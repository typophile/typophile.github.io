    target="_blank">Kabel</a>. Don&#39;t know the other one.

  body: The way the &#39;Strange&#39; letters fit together, it seems likely that this
    was hand-drawn to me. Do you have any reason to be sure this is a font? &#40;There
    are no duplicate letters that could prove a font was used&#41;.

  body: Well, the designer that designed it was part of a contest I put together,
    where the best logo would be selected.  The designer in question also created
    a few other logos for me to look at.  I doubt he would spend all that time drawing
    just for $150.

  body: Doubt or not, I have to agree that &#34;Strange&#34; was certainly custom
    drawn. The letters fit together in a way that is not coincidental. &#40;It is
    today possible to program this into a font, but there&#39;s only one font out
    there that does this, and this is not it.&#41; <BR> <BR>T

  body: Maximo, if you know who designed the logo, why not just ask them?  <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    I don&#39;t think it would take much skill or time to draw those characters.
