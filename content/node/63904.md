body: "Are retail fonts a form of consumerism or a way for designers to work free
  from the constraints of a commission?\r\n\r\nHere's what Nick Shinn wrote in Issue
  6 of the Graphic Design Journal published by the Society of Graphic Designer of
  Canada in 2006:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P1130815_6591.JPG]\r\n\r\nI
  mean look at [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/wasianed/2475328845/in/set-72157602459000103/|this]].
  These industrial revolution era fonts were designed by foundries which by then were
  independent of printers and publishers and used in the most commercial ways. They
  are more interesting to us today than the commissioned Times New Roman.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think of retail fonts?"

    true for a lot of type designers, but not all of them (and I wonder if it's still
    true for him since he wrote that).\r\n\r\nI do have the impression that many,
    if not most, full-time type designers get their bread and butter from commissions,
    with income from retail fonts being supplemental. It's the other way around for
    me, and I feel lucky for that, because I do prefer working on my own ideas without
    the constrains of a commission. Not to say commissions are necessarily bad. Deadlines
    and briefs have a way of providing clarity and purpose to a project. And you definitely
    get paid sooner."

  body: "I don't think that I would call it art because there are usability factors
    involved, I prefer the term design. I don't feel as though I am \"expressing myself\"
    as much as taking a crack at solving age-old problems in my own way. Like both
    Mark and Nick, I like the open ended struggle with form without client. Some day
    perhaps my children may profit from it but quick big bucks don't come from early
    ventures into retail fonts. Mark and Nick have both been at it much longer than
    I so they are seeing light while I am just seeing tunnel :-)\r\nI spent 45 years
    working directly with clients so I am now enjoying toil in their absence.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
