body: "I was wondering if anybody has worked out a technique for search & replace
  in FontLab that allows you to replace something without the replace causing an offset
  in the replaced object. I always seem to get a increase in height & negative horizontal
  position relative to the source & the target. Is Python the answer or is there a
  clever way of setting up the search to avoid this shift?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I think it only happens when the origin points don't overlap between the replacing
    content and the replaced content.

  body: "That is sort of suggested in the documentation... I see. But you have explained
    the principle. :-) So then the strategy for making a replace of a whole object
    might be to replace one half & then the other - but always with two common points...\r\n\r\nGreat.
    I'll try it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
