body: I've just chosen 10 sketches from my discovery phase for a logo for my visual
  design company Binary Colors.  I specialize in flash animation and motion design.  I
  want the logo to have a tech feel but still show characteristics of my design background.  Any
  and all critiques would be appreciated no matter how painful.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bc_final10_4661.gif]

    way. Also, the type reminds me of Benetton (of some wierd reason) \u2013 I immediately
    tought of colours. You will need to visualy align the words better.\r\n\r\nThe
    cables in number seven are great."

    somehow. "

  body: "Too bad Master Card's logo is taken because in some ways that's the obvious
    solution with a name like that. Which brings me to my 2 cents. All of these logos
    ideas are okay but are a little too fussy & clever. I say that because the name
    itself sounds classy & simple. So I would go that way. Think of obvious stuff
    & find a way to make that it simple & low key. If you really want to go the other
    way & be very special effect/lucas film-y; why not a binary stars? One red one
    blue? Then just pick a font and write the name simply underneath. Or do something
    with the two holes in the upper case B maybe, but keep it understated.\r\n\r\nWhy
    this name? What's it mean?\r\n\r\nThanks for showing this to us. "

  body: "Thank you for all the feedback everyone.  I feel that maybe I haven't explored
    the word color as much as I should.  I am having a tough time coming up with concepts
    of color that aren't old and used or just to busy (test patterns, color blocks,
    etc.)  \r\n\r\neliason the '57 Chevy isn't what I was looking for.  I was trying
    to play with a few scripts just to explore some different typeface options but
    it doesn't sound like I got the effect I was looking for-a techy, yet artsy typeface.\r\n\r\nSharon
    the dots are supposed to look like the connector circles on circuit diagrams but
    the more I look at them the more I believe they should be more subtle.\r\n\r\nEben
    I really think your on point.  I've played with the binary star concept a lot
    and have missed the mark.  I would really like something modern and understated.
    \ Maybe I will revisit.  I chose the name for two reasons: (1) Playing off the
    phrase \"Primary\" Colors and (2) Adding the Binary to mean digital since all
    my work is 'digital colors' in essence."

  body: There are a lot actually. OCRA on the "tech" side, all the way to Consolas
    with a slight humanist riff. Or Lucas De Groot's other Mono Space fonts like 'The
    Sans Mono' Also Andale Mono, or Osaka Mono. There is something wrong with the
    lc s In Osaka though. On the top. Orator. Actually I was just looking at Udo,
    even though you don't get the lc l effect but still, it looks pretty great. Add
    some color and you might be there.

  body: I think you need (at least one of) the o's to read clearly as a zero, or else
    the "joke" gets lost. I think even a slashed (or maybe even better, a dotted)
    zero would work.

    great, but isn''t it all caps?  I''m really leaning towards using all lc so I
    can the concept from sketch #5 (the lc b lettermark made of a 1 and 0) as an element
    that goes with the b1nary co1ors.  Another option to use on web pages.'

    two versions & have done with it.  They are just so good. \r\n\r\nThe only thing
    I can imagine doing differently now is maybe letting some colors wash through
    the 01010s. Making the i & l read through the 1 is sooo sweet. It shouldn't work
    logically & yet it does.\r\n\r\nStill, it's hard not to keep digging.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the middle line not being needed I guess you could try it without but I think
    it brings a certain grace. A pause that is probably how the i & l trick works!"

    caps. It's your call finally, but the concept seemed so interesting that I couldn't
    resist playing around with it for a few minutes. Just in case you'd like to go
    along this route, it may be an idea to use the 0s and 1s as a sort of secondary
    property. For instance you could use it as a background pattern on your website,
    or along the rear-face of your letterheads.   \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nEben, reading your
    post was a nice way to start the day this morning:)  I'd be happy to send across

  body: I think that looks REALLY amazing with the colors running through the 0s and
    1s!  The small caps are growing on me too.  As much as I like it I feel that extra
    line of numerals makes the logo massive; that's a lot of real estate.  Nonetheless,
    Arun do you mind if I run in the direction you've taken the design?  I think you
    really hit on something.

    that's an equally valid solution.\r\n\r\nThe way I read it, the little coup in
    the name was that it replaced 'primary colours'  with 'binary colours' thereby
    promising a richer visual experience. It is sort of 'beyond primary colours'.
    Which is why I felt a slightly more exuberant palette made sense. \r\n"
