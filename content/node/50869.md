  please identify this typeface for me?  I'm having a hard time finding anything similar
  that doesn't have a spur on the 'G.'  Thanks."

  body: "I think your guess about pre-digital was the right track -- there is a Photo-Lettering
    typeface called Gillies Modern Gothic Condensed that I think has very similar
    earmarks to this lettering. The fact is that there were hundreds of variations
    of these \"Parallel Gothics\" in their catalog means that it could easily have
    come from a source like that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: That looks like one of Filmotype's G-series, probably Ginger Gothic. The only
    digital equivalent I'm aware of is <a href="http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm" target="_blank">QBF's</a>

  body: I wish I'd seen this earlier, but no, Jimmy, Hombre would NOT be your best
    bet. Mark Simonson's Ginger is both better made and cheaper.
