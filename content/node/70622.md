  body: 'Technically there isn''t a standard set for superscripts but a good font
    with superscripts figures should also have superscript basic math symbols for
    these kind of basic math settings. If it has a superscript alphabet, it should
    also have basic punctuation. Every designer has to draw the line somewhere though
    and supporting mathematical/scientific typesetting can be a very slippery slope. '

    why I shouldn\u2019t add  the rest of the Latin 1 math set."

    to typeset complete formulas used as upper or lower indices, TeX relies on optical
    sizes, not on special characters to be used for indices. Here is a formula I copied
    from some book on computer algorithms. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmopticals_4852.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    font is Computer Modern.\r\n\r\nThe text was typeset in 12pt; the indices came
    out at 8pt and indices of indices at 6pt. The corresponding character sets follow.
    You can see that the 6 point (bottom line) is not half the length of the 12pt
    line. Widths have been \"optimized\" for displaying formulas.\r\n\r\nHere is an
    interesting atypi talk on the subject (<a href=\"http://www.tug.org/twg/mfg/papers/jkuester/20041002-atypi.pdf\">pdf</a>,
    1,8M).\r\n"
