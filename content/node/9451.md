  body: This is an old face called <a href="http://www.linotype.com/59627/grecosolid-font.html"
    target="_blank">Greco</a>. There have been various digital versions, including
    the lighter one on the first line, but availability is a bit spotty. I don&#39;t
    know where you could get the lighter one.

  body: 'Yes, Mark, this is a very old face. As you know this is a Spanish design
    from the twenties, from the Richard Gans foundry. It&#39;s amazing the credit
    appearing at Linotype website: <BR> <BR>&#34;Designer DsgnHaus Inc., 1996 &#34;

  body: Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of stuff like that around in the case of digital versions
    of old fonts. The funny thing is FontHaus &#40;a.k.a. DsgnHaus&#41; does not appear
    to carry the font anymore. I believe it was digitized in the early nineties by
    a now-defunct foundry and was only distributed by FontHaus. <BR> <BR>There was
    also a Linotype &#40;metal&#41; version of this called Vulcan. That may be the
    version with the lighter weight that I&#39;ve seen.

  body: Thanks for the information. The lighter face was the one I really wanted to
    find. The sample comes from an ad running in the current issue of The New York
    Review of Books.

    so I gave up!

  body: The lighter version was digitized. It was part of the same family of Greco
    fonts that FontHaus used to sell, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be available anywhere
    anymore, unlike the bold weights.

    was sold by the recently-defunct Precision Type. A search for them now shows that

    <BR>In any case I am happy that you have gotten the font you were looking for.
