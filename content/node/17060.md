  body: It look like <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/">Treacyfaces'</a> Arrow
    to me, possibly with some modifications. (Sorry, no direct link to a font sample,
    but they do have an <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html">online sample
    setter</a>.)

  body: "It's a bastardized version of TF Arrow and Beaufort. TF Arrow and Beufort
    were used as the template and the points were changed to make the current FAO
    logo (see the \"W\" which was modified) which apparently has more than five versions
    of itself. Ironically, breaking the rules of it's own brand.\r\n\r\nThe logo reminds
    me very much of what Microsoft did to Helvetica, they changed some points and
    call their version Arial. It's a cheap-ass design copout that is becoming all
    to familiar in the digital age."
