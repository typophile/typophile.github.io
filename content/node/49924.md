  Grande and Optima would complement each other well?\r\n\r\nI am thinking Lucida
  Grande for the body and Optima for headings.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find some info
  on what exactly makes for good complementary fonts but I could not really find any
  info so I just went with what I thought looked good! Of course, the fact that I
  know next to nothing about type makes this a choice based on somewhat dubious grounds.
  \r\n\r\nAny feedback is much appreciated."

  body: "What works well is the modus operandi when it comes to design. If it happens
    to look good, even better. So you're fine in that regard! \r\n\r\nHowever by the
    title of your post, it suggests you'll be using this on the web. If so, be aware
    that not all users/browsers will have access to such fonts. You may want to Google
    \"web-safe fonts\" or \"SiFR\" to learn about such issues and possible solutions."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nI am a bit worried about the choice as it
    is my first time actually picking the font for a project and I am a total type
    beginer!\r\n\r\nAlso, the project is in Flash so I will just embed the fonts (most
    of the reason I want to use slightly non-standard fonts is because I can! Though
    I am sure mac users are used to Lucida Grande...)"

  body: It's always a little nerve wracking when you're doing something for the first
    time! But really, just give it a shot, and see how it looks. And experiment. As
    you do so you'll start developing an eye for what works and what doesn't when
    it comes to type.
