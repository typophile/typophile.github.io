  Petersburg, Russia in 1738. Unfortunately, I have not found any font that might
  suit well. An example from that Journal 'Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae'
  from 1738 can be found at: http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E022.pdf\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for any suggestions.\r\nCarlo"
