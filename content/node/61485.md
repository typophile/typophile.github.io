  body: Princess Mononoke is actually <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trajan/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D20%26dock%3D0%26size%3D57%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPRINCESS%2520MONONKE%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%252Cot.liga">Trajan
    Bold</a>. The smaller type is <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bodega-serif/">Bodega
    Serif.</a> Not sure what the main title of Kiki's Delivery Service is. The word
    "the" is some sort of Garamond bold italic or similar, but I'm not sure which.

    at bottom. And the Kirsten Dunst sticker."
