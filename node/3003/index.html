		<div class="commentbody">Nice problem to have! <BR> <BR>Adobe has some great fonts. In a library that size, there's bound to be some&hellip; well, some lesser works, but there's tons of quality there, and lots of utility in their OpenType implementation.  <BR> <BR>The faces with optical variations are very useful. They give those of us mourning the decline of Multiple Masters some comfort.  <BR> <BR>Whether you get the Folio or individual sets is a matter for you, your taste, and your calculator.  <BR> <BR>I agree that you should look at the Storm fonts. Great value for unusual faces. <BR> <BR>Linotype's Optima Nova is well worth a look, and you should  look for some of Matthew Carter's faces. <BR> <BR>Another thing to consider when looking at different foundries is their licensing conditions: some allow embedding in PDFs, some don't, some allow modifications of the fonts for in-house use, some don't, that sort of thing.  <BR> <BR>Most foundries that don't include embedding in their standard EULA will allow it under separate licensing, but you should check all that up front.  You don't want to prepare documentation in a PDF only to discover that you can't use your chosen font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would also consider Bitstream Type Odyssey 2: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/info/bitstream-type-odyssey-2/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/info/bitstream-type-odyssey-2/">http://www.myfonts.com/info/bitstream-type-odyssey-2/</a></a>  <BR> <BR>It's just $1500 for 1450 fonts. There are no OpenType fonts there, but many quality digitizations of classic faces. The typefaces are renamed but e.g. for Linotype faces, the designes are licensed.  <BR> <BR>The digital versions of Bitstream fonts are really superb. For example, I think their Futura is better than Adobe's or URW's. In many cases, I consider the Bitstream digital versions better than the ones with the original names. After all, the initial digitization of the Bitstream type library was supervised by Matthew Carter.  <BR> <BR>You don't like ITC faces so you'll live with the fact that Bitstream no longer has the license to distribute their digitizations of ITC fonts, and they are not included on Type Odyssey.  <BR> <BR>On the other hand: probably the best way to get a huge load of Bitstream and ITC fonts probably is to buy Corel DRAW 9 on eBay. :D  <BR>You can get a copy for $20 and it includes an incredible collection of fonts: over 1000 Western fonts from Bitstream and URW, plus a set of international fonts (Cyrillic, CE, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic).  <BR> <BR>Of course, Type Odyssey 2 contains quite a few new faces from other foundries, and it may be the reason the get the library.  <BR> <BR>I'd also pay attention to the ParaType library:  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?3967302fb3976b83a34d82d8464b7a79" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?3967302fb3976b83a34d82d8464b7a79">http://www.myfonts.com/url?3967302fb3976b83a34d82d8464b7a79</a></a> <BR>Some of their fonts are Unicode with great hand hinting, and all of them are available in Western, CE and Cyrillic encodings. They have very fine licensed versions of Bitstream fonts, and quite a few original designs.  <BR> <BR>Adam <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">m-ga,  <BR> <BR>the Bitstream situation goes roughly as follows: in the 1980s, Linotype was still a large print machines manufacturer who was not interested in making digital fonts for the slowly emerging DTP market. A group of type designers including Matthew Carter left Linotype and started Bitstream, which was to become the first digital type foundry in the world. They digitized original Linotype typefaces, but Linotype refused to license the original trademarks to them. So they used names derived from their own classification (Humanist 777 being Frutiger, Swiss 721 being Helvetica, etc.). Bitstream licensed the names from some other foundries, so some of the fonts used original names (e.g. Futura), but those copied from Linotype, Monotype and Berthold designs usually did not. However, these still were very faithful and high-quality digitizations, not cheap knock-offs like many many other companies offered them.  <BR> <BR>Some time later, the original team left Bitstream. At this time, the company signed the unfortunate deal with Corel so that nearly the entire Bitstream type library (850 fonts or so) shipped with Corel DRAW starting from version 4.0.  <BR> <BR>Over the time, Bitstream's policy towards other vendors and designers matured, and when Jim Lyles took over the maintainence of the Bitstream type library, they started releasing new designs as Bitstream New Font Collection. They also added the euro character to their old fonts, of course.  <BR> <BR>So the Bitstream Type Odyssey includes a large portion (~850 fonts I think) of the original library and some 600 fonts that are new designs, released by Bitstream or licensed from other foundries.  <BR> <BR>You can browse the contnets of Type Odyssey 2 here: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha">http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha</a></a> <BR> <BR>Last year, Linotype and Bitstream signed an agreement which finally ended their dispute over the designs. Linotype officially &quot;licensed&quot; the designs to Bitstream (but not the trademarks). This means, that prior to that, Swiss 721 was an unlicensed clone of Helvetica, and now it's a licensed version of Helvetica, but sold under a different name. The press release is here: <a href="http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/071803_linotype.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/071803_linotype.html">http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/071803_linotype.html</a></a>  <BR> <BR>This is handy to know as this sort of confirms that the Bitstream versions really are derived from the same original sources.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam <BR></div>

Bitstream came about because Mike Parker struck a deal to provide copies of Linotype fonts to a client who couldn't license from Linotype. This client provided the startup investment for Bitstream, and Mike jumped ship from Linotype, taking Matthew Carter and David Berlow with him. That, at least, is Mike's account.</div>

You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Bitstream Product without Bitstream's prior written consent. &quot; <BR> <BR>If the license did not prohibit this, you would normally be allowed to put any trademarked name into the font provided they are for your use only. However, IMO this is impractical and may cause confusion. Note that the original fonts are QA'ed until get-no so I wouldn't want to modify them unless I really need to.   <BR> <BR>On a related matter, the Linotype EULA is more liberal with regard to modification: &quot;You may modify the Font-Software to satisfy your design requirements. Such modifications are in every respect subject to this Font-Software License Agreement. &quot; <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/viewlicense?id=8" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/viewlicense?id=8">http://www.myfonts.com/viewlicense?id=8</a></a> <BR> <BR>As for the digitizations: for many of the older designs, there is no &quot;one master design&quot;. These often were work in progress, evolving in the designer's mind and constantly adapted to match various technological requirements. Some typefaces have undergone such major revisions that the current versions barely look similar to the initial ones. Best example: Palatino. Current Palatino Linotype is a heavily simiplified text version, Berthold's version captures the display style of the initial drawings. Bitstream's Zapf Humanist 801 is somewhere in-between I think.  <BR> <BR>So in some cases, different artwork from different periods was used by different companies to prepare the digitizations. Also, most digitizations involve adaptation, so the person who art-directed the digital version also has an influence on the final look.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam <BR> <BR></div>

We cancelled our contract with Agfa Monotype as soon as we were able, and currently no one has permission to sell any Tiro typefaces. They still show up on a couple of AM reseller sites, but you can't order them. If you do find anyone selling our fonts, let us know! <BR> <BR>Currently, none of the old Tiro retail faces are available. We pulled them all, even from our own site. Ross has completely redesigned Plantagenet, and the OT version of this is available on a limited basis now and will, when the new website goes live, be available for download and licensing. There are tentative plans to redesign some of the others, but this is a low priority.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;What I am getting at is this, does type stink when it gets old? <BR> <BR>So I guess we don't need new songs, books, movies, and architecture either? <BR> <BR>Gerald, it's terrible what has happened to typographic culture in the last few years, particularly in North America. In effect there is a moratorium on typographers using new typefaces. The general preference is for retro scripts and mid 20th century faces (mainly sans). The other stultifying factor is the preponderance of bland, utilitarian fonts given away by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe with their software apps. <BR> <BR>So yes, I would say that public sector organizations owe no fealty to mainstream corporate culture, and the affinity of bureaucracies is a powerful attraction between the two, but it should be resisted by free-thinking individuals.  <BR> <BR>Why is a public sector organisation prefering to buy from a small, independent foundry considered to be a &quot;charitable donation&quot;? Why is it business as usual to shop Adobe, but largesse to patronize Storm? <BR> <BR>Death to Helvetica!</div>

Many areas get grey. I believe Autologic, Bertold and Letraset produced digital IK data internally previous to the &quot;Desktop Fad&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, I think the key to understanding Bitstream's role is that they were the first <i>device independent</i> digital type company. Other companies, including Linotype, had been involved in making digital type for several years before the formation of Bitstream, but for use on their own propriatary machines. Bitstream was, apparently, the first company to make and license digital fonts without also selling you the machine. <BR> <BR>So Bitstream was instrumental in both the largest single act of font piracy in history, and the collapse of an industry that stopped making the one thing that made it a lot of money. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

If you cut and pasted to a new document, you'd paste in Times New Roman (or whatever default). <BR> <BR>For this to happen, though, would require (a) Microsoft to write a better version of Acrobat than Adobe, and (b) Foundries to allow editable versions of their faces to ship (albeit in limited form) without royalties. <BR> <BR>In other words, it's never gonna happen. <BR> <BR>Here's hoping MS expand their type library sometime soon. In another 15 years, the ubiquity of Arial may pervade my very soul.</div>

A shame, because Georgia's my favourite of the MS core fonts for web. <BR> <BR>Although Verdana's great on screen, it's funky in print (eg. check out the bars on the capital I, added for onscreen legibility) and not best suited for that purpose.  <BR> <BR>Additionally, Arial's default presence is in a greater range of weights (there's a black, and the narrow weights are bundled with Office) making it easier to implement as a corporate face. <BR> <BR>By the way, have a look at this Yoshi Sodeoka site for a nice example of Georgia onscreen: <BR> <BR><a href="http://projects.c505.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://projects.c505.com/">http://projects.c505.com/</a></a> <BR> <BR>You'll need to scroll down, he doesn't use the top of the window.</div>
