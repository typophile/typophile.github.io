  body: I have some fonts in my collection dating back from the wild days of the mid
    &#39;90s. Kids with Fontographer would open up an Arial or Helvetica and paste
    in their own &#40;usually bad, usually grunge&#41; glyphs and save it under the
    original name.

  body: There was a foundry called Tarm Saft and they were from Sweden. Apparently
    they had a concept of fonts as a form of computer virus. <BR> <BR>So they created
    a ton of fonts, some really quite nice and original and named them absolutely
    vulgar names is Swedish so all the hip NYC art directors were specing out fonts
    names after genetalia etc . . . <BR> <BR>Funky? I&#39;d say . . .  <BR> <BR>:D

  body: I&#39;ve always been partial to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pious-henry-itc/">ITC
    Pious Henry</a> for a dose of &uuml;ber-condensed typ-o-graphic funkification.
    And Jukebox&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000021">Gypsy
    Switch</a> has a certain inescapable friskiness to it. <BR> <BR>Do either of these
    fit your bill, Brian?

    or the Swedish font name-prank. &#40;Research your font selections!&#41; I went
    to Font Diner.. saw Square Deal. Reminds me of a joke my grandmother tells me
    every time we ride past a cow pasture where the hay is rolled up into circular
    bales: <BR>&#34;Know why those cows complain about the hay rolled up like that?
    They don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re getting a square meal!&#34; <BR>&#40;Every
    time! I&#39;m proud of myself for still never ruining the joke by answering for
    her.&#41; <BR> <BR>John, what are some of the names &#40;or should I just not
    ask?&#41;'
