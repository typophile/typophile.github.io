  <a href=\"http://www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=7&subpage=viewfonts\"
  target=\"_blank\">House's League Night</a>?\r\n\r\nIt is quite expensive, and the
  client I'm working for isn't interested in paying that much for this font, but would
  like something similar if it is available somewhere!\r\n\r\nAny ideas?? \r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nReedly."

    folks don't need to see the country page. If the software isn't sure where you
    reside it will take you to the country page to confirm.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't need
    to do that more than once tho. Your country selection should be baked into your
    cookie. Hmm, I'll look into it."
