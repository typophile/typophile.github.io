body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am needing help for the design of a new font. The following
  considerations need to be taken:\r\n\r\nIt is for a clothing label, specialising
  in high quality rugby wear.\r\nIt is based in France.\r\nIt must suggest speed /
  movement.\r\nIt must look as good on the label inside as it would outside on a shirt.\r\nIt
  will mainly be used in white, on a navy background.\r\n\r\nAll ideas very welcome.\r\n\r\nMerci."

  body: I'm actually with Mike... Excoffon's faces actually sort of fit. See Banco(I
    know it's not exactly beautiful) I wouldn't use Mistral though..
