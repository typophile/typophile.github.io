  Watson (the book is on archive.org, but the site seems unresponsive right now, so
  I can't paste the URL). \r\nThe font looks to me a little like Caslon with very
  short descenders, but I'm not sure (not an expert). Does anyone know? Is there an
  electronic font that resembles this one somewhere? Thanks! "
