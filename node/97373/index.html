<p>It&rsquo;s not solution to this problem, since they can upload it again, under another link, but it&rsquo;s one small battle won.</p>
<p>@frode – If I understood what they wrote on their website, they will start doing it after they raise some planned amount of money and after you make donation to them, according to donation level scheme they have offered on website. Which is all OK, but I understood that they still haven&rsquo;t started fully their services.</p>
<p>@ Ryan – I won&rsquo;t comment this, sorry.</p>
<p>@ majus – That sounds like a good idea! Actually, that gave me an idea (which may sound ridiculous to some). What about making an organization of foundries, type designers, distributions&hellip; with one aim – to fight on legal ways against such websites who share font files illegally. Organization that will have lawyers, membership fee. Since individual fight is pretty useless and rarely succeeds. I don&rsquo;t know how all this sounds nor would it be possible to make something like this, but I&rsquo;d say sooner or later, something must be done on some serious level by font market.</p>

<p>BTW, I know there is a debate on this topic that will go on Ad nauseam, but within the design group, exposure and use of a commercial font (prior to payment for said font) is likely more helpful than not. Since the designers get the clients to pay for the font, and anyone not interested in buying a license would have never paid for one anyway.</p>
<p>Any type designer that actually makes money off their creations is probably making good fonts.

<p>About what you said&hellip; your right is to protect what&rsquo;s your ownership and that&rsquo;s starting point. What comes after that is just a collection of other relative things (luck, verbal skills, realistic view, contacts, will&hellip;).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with you about second part – &ldquo;Any type designer that actually makes money off their creations is probably making good fonts. Everyone else&hellip;&rdquo; That is very relative statement. Mostly, the number of those who recognize what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s not is on the side of the NOTs. Very often, font sale is dictated by customers opinion, those who buy it make something good, &ldquo;good&rdquo;, bad or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. So when some type designer makes something, he might can predict how it will show up on market, but much more often it&rsquo;s hit or miss situation, just like with other things that are designed – different types of templates, themes, stock materials&hellip;</p>

Beyond that&hellip; Even our good friend Mr. OldNick has shown that his revenues (and he has a sh*t ton of fonts) equates to less that US$50,000 per year BEFORE TAX, on average over the course of 11 years.</p>
<p>The smaller font aggregators are pulling in a little from everybody, but they have the overhead of a digital storefront, payment processing, etc. I would estimate they clear a few times that amount? Monotype seemingly owns the rest of the market (commercial licensing and embedded products). Eh, just my opinions.</p>
<p>Mr. tourdeforce: I was not asking for, nor wanting a link to the site you reference. I just note that there are at least two <em>private</em> forums that provide access to just about all fonts &amp; foundries. Any site you could send someone to, without providing your login details will be inconsequential. I do agree that type designers never know what will be popular (i.e., actually sell), but more often than not, the good designers sell, and the not-so-good ones do not. &lsquo;Good&rsquo; being the relative descriptor. Price point helps too :)</p>
