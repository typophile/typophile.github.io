body: "I'm trying to create flash cards (in Adobe Flash) for a mathematics course,
  and it's driving me crazy trying to figure out the Ascii codes for all the mathematical
  symbols I need. I was wondering if anyone knows of a free font out there that has
  all the math symbols you'd typically find in an equation editor like MathType. \r\n\r\nIf
  no one knows of anything I can get for free, is there a low-cost option out there
  that might do? I don't want to spend a ton of money on this, simply because I don't
  think I'd use the font all that much other than for the design for this particular
  course.\r\n\r\nThanks for any information you can provide,\r\n\r\nStevie"

    you will see that there are probably more symbols than you will ever need. '

  body: if you want good mathematical typesetting, I'd suggest not only looking at
    the fonts for LaTeX but actually using real LaTeX, and then pulling the outlines
    of your entire equations into flash. You can write formulas simply (with a standard
    math-like syntax) and not have to worry about spacing, superscripts, and so on.
    It becomes all the more important if you use matrices or large integral symbols
    and so on.

    Equation Editor]]\r\n\r\nI believe there's another program called [[http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/math_science/latexit.html|LaTeXit]],
    which is similar and perhaps better.  I don't use a Mac, so this information is
    based on what others have told me.\r\n\r\nScott"
