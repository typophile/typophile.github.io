    of craft and not for financial gain. If they own the rights and have their own
    intentions or not, you are trying to replicate an existing type design... and
    apparently don't even have decent scans of the original. This doesn't make a lot
    of sense to me. If they had approached you, completely different story, but likely
    (from what I understand) Neufville has its own plans.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Hrant, Gerald,\r\n\r\nThis isn't quite accurate. Occasionally, designers
    will revive an un-revived typeface that a certain foundry has the rights to. After
    that designer shows the fonts to the foundry, the foundry will\u2014on some occasions\u2014license
    them and distribute them itself. This is what Eric is hoping for, I think.\r\n\r\nIt
    is quite costly for a foundry to revive a face like this on its own. (The money
    for Blackletter just isn't there\u2026) But if a designer does it for them, it
    costs them nothing. It is a win-win situation, and I know designers who have gone
    through this before. So please don't say never, or assume the worst. Eric's intentions
    here are admirable, and this is the right path to take. If Neufville is not interested
    in the design, Eric may be able to release it through other channels under a different
    name\u2014perhaps even with Neufville's blessing. \r\n\r\nDiscussion is always
    good. "

  body: "It is quite rare for a font house (especially an old-school one like Neufville)
    to pick up an unsolicited design, even if it's free - the main reasons being quality
    and suitability. The one case like this I remember is that guy who made a DIN
    clone, not knowing the issues (although DIN is admittedly a \"public\" design)
    and when he tried to sell it or something the FontFont people graciously paid
    him to take it completely over... and didn't even use it.\r\n\r\nIn Eric's case:
    he's a self-confessed beginner*, he knows the issues, and hasn't even fleshed
    out the whole design yet*, so here's what I would suggest: contact Neufville (maybe
    even arrange for a telephone call) and tell them there's a design you really really
    like, and you've sort of started on it, but realize they own it; you want to keep
    working on it, and see it released somehow; you offer to submit it to them when
    it's pretty much finished; they don't have to pay anything, and they can accept
    it or not, but what would be really nice is if they critiqued the work in progress
    so that it ends up to their liking and they'll sell it. If they say no, you stop
    (and maybe make something inspired by it). If they say yes, you work hard, and
    listen to them. The risk is that they'll say no at the end and you'll end up with
    a design that's dead in the water. But at least you would have learned a lot.\r\n\r\n*
    Correct?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a big chicken ;-)\r\n\r\nNow cut it out! Make sure you get the whole international
    dialing code thing right. It should be in the front of your phone book. Then,
    after they pick up the phon, say Buenos Dias, and then ask politely if they speak
    English. I'm sure that they get English-speaking calls all the time. English is
    the language of European business now, with the EU and all. How many Swedes speak
    Spanish? Exactly. Nothing to be afraid about.\r\n\r\nThen tell the person on the
    phone that you are type designer calling from the United States. You'd like to
    speak with someone to get some information on old German Bauer tyapefaces. I'm
    sure that they will connect you to the correct person, or ask you to call back
    later.\r\n\r\nThen it is up to you. It isn't that hard, really.\r\n\r\nI used
    to get the fear of God in me when I had to call up German institutions for the
    first time, and speak in horrendous German (while English is the international
    language of business, it is not the international language of bureacracy. Bureacrats
    must always be spoken to in their native language, if possible). But it always
    worked, and I soon got over it. Now I live in the midst of these crazy people.
    No one will hate you because you are from the midwest."

    knows English, I've had lunch with him :-). You might add \"Estoy yamandoh desde

    If you're still faced with Spanish, it probably means the guy is out* - try again
    later (after saying \"moutchas grahsias\" - \"thank you very much\"). Oh, do get
    the time-zones right. And remember that in Spain they start the day late and finish
    it later, and take a HUGE lunch break, starting around 1PM in Barcelona.\r\n\r\n*
