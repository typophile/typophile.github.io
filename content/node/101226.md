  body: "Very close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima
    Nova]] but can't be positive. /S and /M look a bit off. Would need more distinctive
    letters. That's may be something from Font Bureau...\r\n\r\nEDIT: could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/salvo-sans|Salvo
    Sans]], a bit more extended than Proxima Nova and /M and /S look better."
