  font for my &#34;Diplom&#34; &#40;like Master&#41;. Now I want hear what do you
  mean. <BR> <BR>I have made a dynamic Flashsite to show the Font. The site is in
  german Language &#40;hope it doesent matter&#41; <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.screentypo.org"

  body: Jens, finally somebody did it! <BR>You&#39;re using some of the x-height for
    the descenders, thus making the font&#39;s apparent size bigger. And although
    it&#39;s been done before&#42;, this is the first bitmap font I&#39;ve seen that
    does it very well. For example, the curve at the bottom of the bowl in the &#34;p&#34;
    effectively hides the misalignment &#40;even though it makes the form smaller&#41;.
    And such curves are also present aesthetically, like in the &#34;e&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4.html</A>
    <BR> <BR>Why not also give the ascenders some extra room? At least you can lower
    the bars of the &#34;f&#34; and &#34;t&#34; by a pixel. <BR> <BR>Furthermore,
    your widths have a nice humanism, as do many of the forms &#40;like the &#34;a&#34;&#41;.
    And the caps too - I&#39;d love to see more of those, in fact the whole character
    set, please! <BR> <BR>The only important thing I&#39;m unsure about is the semi-serifs.
    I think they do add a nice flavor to the design &#40;and might even improve bouma
    formation - although your spacing is loose for that, in fact the spacing looks
    off in places too&#41;, but one bad thing they are doing is reducing the apparent
    height of the ascenders. <BR> <BR>Overall, this is a groundbreaking design, which
    just needs a little bit of refinement to become highly usable. Congrats, and &#42;please&#42;
    keep it up! <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, I&#39;m not sure your site is working right.&#41;

  body: ' I hope i can translate the theoretical part of the &#34;Diplom&#34; in english
    soon. <BR>But until that I would say a little about the philosophy. <BR>The x-height
    was chosen by designing the font. First of all I want to make a Screenfont for
    a better reading and also a aesthetic look. So took a more classical style. I
    think the big x-height is better for reading. The Semi-Serif was made because
    a serif font is better for reading but not at screen. So I took semi-serif. So
    it improves the &#34;readability&#34;. <BR> <BR>Some words to the Spacing: That
    was the most difficult item for me. My pretense was to improve the &#34;readability&#34;
    and for this I deside to improve the spacing. Small spacing is hard for reading
    long articles. The wide spacing maid many difficults. Maybe because I don&#39;t
    knew anything about fonttechnologie at this time. But at some letters it needs
    realy a refinement. <BR> <BR>Im curently develop a SansSerif called Standup &#40;you
    will see soon a sample&#41;. Afters this i will improve NNF to a scalable Font
    whith hinting for all small sizes. BTW: Does any have a tutorial about hinting?
    <BR> <BR>The site screentypo.org is beta. Maybe it takes some sec for loading.
    You will see soon the whole font and all &#34;schnitte&#34; &#40;maybe cuttings?&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;dont understand? me neither &#42;g&#42;&#41; '

  body: ' &#62; I think the big x-height is better for reading. <BR> <BR>Upto a point
    - the extenders do play a vital role in reading because they define the shapes
    of &#42;words&#42;, which is what we generally read, at least when reading immersively.
    On the other hand, the screen is a lot less immersive than paper, so I would say
    that screen fonts do actually need larger x-heights than fonts for print - and
    your x-height is great! You&#39;re leaning more towards &#42;legbility&#42; as
    opposed to readability &#40;and the same with respect to your loose spacing&#41;,
    but it&#39;s a good decision. However, I think the ascenders are on the border
    of being adequately long, and their serifs might be increasing the problem. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; The Semi-Serif was made because a serif font is better for reading but
    not at screen. <BR> <BR>Great logic! <BR> <BR>I feel the semi-serif is generally
    under-rated, and it can play a great role in print as well. <BR> <BR>&#62; hinting
    for all small sizes <BR> <BR>You might consider embedding bitmaps instead. <BR>
