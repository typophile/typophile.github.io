  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nFirst things that come to mind:\r\n\r\nIt seems there are some
    problems concerning contast. Some things too thick, others too thin. Your 's'
    for example, has its thick at the wrong place. It should be in the middle, on
    the spine. 'x' too wide, 'v' and 'w' as well. The 'm' doesn't really seem to work,
    the 'n' is, but the 'm' is looking weird. And I think the slab-serif on the 'd'
    might be pointing in the wrong direction. Crossbar of the 'A' is too high, 'S'
    has same prob as lc 's'.\r\n\r\nWanted to say more, but I have to go now. :)"

  body: "Thanks Jelmar. I didn't even notice the serif on the d. Duh. I've been using
    Stymie for some reference, but I don't want to copy it too much.\r\n\r\nI made
    the letters using the same size pieces, and put the weights in the right place.
    Could it be all optical? Is there a way you group letters to compare weight, or
    is it trial and error?"

  body: Well, on the 's/S' the thickest part should be the spine. And with contrast
    I meant that your stems are quite thick, and the other parts are quite thin in
    comparison. But also that some of your horizontals are the thick variant (like
    the crossbar on the 't' and some on your numerals) and some are thin (like the
    tops of most letters, and the crossbar of the 'f').

  body: "You'll find, unfortunately, that even in a font where everything is the same
    weight, it isn't really. Even Avant Garde, Lubalin, and Futura have slightly thinner
    horizontal than vertical parts, and their straight lines are thinner than their
    curved lines. In your case, here are a few weight problems I see immediately.
    Some of them are technical, and others optical.\r\n-The main stems of a lot of
    your letters are thicker than the rest of the letter: MNU, BRP, hmnku, apgqdb.
    Weight is very dodgy in the small caps.\r\n-I think your round letters should
    tend more toward square, as in Melior or cuttlefish's <a href=http://typophile.com/node/28416>Palormak</a>.
    I'm thinking here of OQCG and ceos, which look to have been imported almost straight
    from Stymie.\r\n-The biggest way to solve the wonkiness of your S is to move the
    control points that are on the vertical parts in toward the center. Also, make
    sure it has the standard S stress (the lowercase s needs that too).\r\n-Some of
    your letters are too cobbled together. I'm especially looking at the M, \xDF,
    small caps, and most of your diacriticked letters, which I'm guessing you haven't
    updated since you smoothed out the letters they're based on (like a, n).\r\n-The
    numerals are too normal. As it is, though you've customized them appreciably,
    they still look like they want to go back to Stymie.\r\n\r\nAltogether, an good
    and interesting start, and I'd love to see where it goes."

  body: "I wanted some stroke contrast, so I made the stems thicker. Are they distracting
    or awkward?\r\n\r\nIt seems like I have to rework most of the characters. I think
    I will go  back to the \"pieces\" and try to find a better solution with the contrast.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the tips guys."

  body: No problem with making the stems thicker than horizontals. I think I was trying
    to say that your curved areas need to be thicker than your straight stems, for
    optical balance. I didn't state that part very well.

  body: "> <em>Should all the horizontals be the same weight?</em>\r\n\r\nNo, they
    do not <em>need</em> to be the same weight, but if all strokes are of varying
    weight, your typeface starts to bounce all over the place. It will look a bit..
    how do you say that (english is not my native tongue).. nervous or restless I
    guess. Also keeping the weights on the different angles (vertical/horizontal/diagonal)
    more or less consistent, will make your characters work together better."
