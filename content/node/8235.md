body: 'Dear, typophiles! <BR> <BR>I am writing this letter, because recently I found
  &#34;<a href="http://www.sessions.edu" target="_blank">www.sessions.edu</a>&#34;.
  As you know my origin is bulgarian and thus I am unable to afford a substantial
  tuition in the field of graphic design. Currently I am designing and accumulating
  money in order to invest in my future education.  <BR>This thread is simply for
  some feedback about the &#34;Graphic Design Master&#39;s Certificate&#34; found
  at &#34;<a href="http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html" target="_blank">http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html</a>&#34;.  <BR>
  My main concern is : &#34;Does it worth it?&#34;;&#34;Would the certificate be valued
  by employers?  <BR>In general, please comment on this specific master&#39;s program
  for graphic design. <BR> <BR>All your words will be highly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Sincerely,
  <BR>Galin K.'

  body: Galin, this post would do better in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/30.html?1103556144">general
    discussions</a> thread, rather than in the Logo/ID Critique thread. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    do a google search on Sessions.edu before making the decision. I saw a few things,
    such as <a href="http://www.complaints.com/june2003/complaintoftheday.june2.9.htm">this</a>,
    and wasn&#39;t impressed. Also, I don&#39;t think that online certificates are
    seen as valuable in the design field. Most importantly, this isn&#39;t a Master&#39;s
    program in the way you mean. Notice that you get a &#34;certificate&#34; for it,
    not a degree. I smell a scam here.

  body: Thanks, Chris. I thought about that, too. You might be right, because the
    quality of the designs of Sessions.edu graduates is at most average. <BR> <BR>I
    was really better to post this in general discussions. Sorry for posting it here.
    ;&#41; <BR>I hope it wasn&#39;t very bothering. <BR> <BR>Sincerely, <BR>G.K

  body: Certificates, IMHO, are only useful for employers to see if you have specific
    tool-set skills.  <BR> <BR>Also, I just looked at their web site. I think that
    answers your question for you. ;o&#41;
