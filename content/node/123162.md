  body: 'My first hunch seeing this one is "latin counter-part of some non-latin language".
    Noirer (noir = black in French so "more black" => noir<strong>er</strong>?) is
    a fashion label from Korea so I tried to focus the search on fonts for the Korean
    language. [[http://www.fonts.com/font/hanyang/hy-myeong|Hy Myeong]] looks not
    so far (close to some sort of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/century|Century]]?)
    but very hard to be positive at this size and on a black background. '
