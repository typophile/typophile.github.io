  for a St. Louis arts organization. Out of several options, here's the direction
  my client picked. It's loosely based on Bodoni and Benton Modern.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/25th_logo_4210.png]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could offer some input on how to improve the curves, I'd really appreciate
  it. Some areas don't feel quite right yet, particularly in the way the swashes above
  and below cradle the shapes of the numbers.\r\n\r\nFeedback much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    lower right are too vertical: take vertical ends in a bit, and adjust the curves
    to match.\r\n\r\nWith 5 you have to work beziers; you want to have your control
    points aligned, and then you can work the curves."
