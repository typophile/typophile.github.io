  body: FYI The actual typeface is called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/metropolitaines/"
    target="_blank"> Metropolitaines</a>. Paris Metro  <BR>is a free version &#40;dare
    I say rip-off?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Lars THX, it&#39;s nice I don&#39;t have to point
    that out for once. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hmmm, Metropolitaines is most definitely the <i>Official Paris Metro Font</i>
    &#40;TM&#41; and there are indeed many entrances to Metro stations in Paris decorated
    with signs set in this face or something very similar. <BR> <BR>However, it would
    seem that the font on Brad&#39;s picture is actually completely different and
    devoid of obvious Art Nouveau stylistics. <BR> <BR>No idea what it is though,
    I don&#39;t expect it&#39;s available in digitized form. Then again, it shouldn&#39;t
    be too hard to recreate this from scratch &#40;especially if all you wanted was
    a sign saying [METRO]&#41;... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    Deco. Maybe it exists as a font too, yaneverknow...
