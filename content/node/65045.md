  body: For many of these flags, you can find SVG files [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_flags|in
    Wikimedia Commons]].  You'll have to check and honor the license of each individual
    file, but many of these are explicitly released into the public domain.  If you're
    satisfied with them, or if you only need to make minor modifications, it could
    save you hours of work.

    and, surprisingly, some of us have interests other than and beyond type -- geopolitics
    and religion are among the non-type interests given fairly regular airings --
    and in the 'anything goes' General Discussion category I think any typophile can

    at Christmastide, you can be damn sure that I'll ask here. [Joe, vegetarian stove-top

    vegan stuffing I concocted for my daughter and her tree-huggin' vegan friends.
    I quote from an email I sent to her:\r\n\r\n\"Chop or tear a loaf of dark bread
    (ideally dark rye) into sugar cube size pieces.\r\n\r\nAdd a cup of chopped pecans,
    or some other nut, to the bread.\r\n\r\nSlice about a pound of portabello mushrooms
    into large bite size pieces, and chop a head of anise into something similar.\r\n\r\nDice
    a couple of onions.\r\n\r\nUsing too much olive oil, saut\xE9 the mushrooms, onions
    and anise along with:\r\n1/2 tsp. each of dried sage, rosemary and fennel seed,\r\n1/4
    tsp. ground ginger\r\n1/8 tsp. ground clove.\r\n\r\nOnce well wilted, mix in a
    tbsp. of black bean paste. If you don't have black bean paste, add some salt or
    soy sauce.\r\n\r\nRemove from heat, maybe mix in some molasses. (1-2 tbsp?)\r\n\r\nCrush
    3 large cloves of garlic.\r\n\r\nMix vegetables and garlic with bread (and a tbsp.
    of walnut oil if you have it*), moisten mixture with oil and some cider, apple
    juice or vinegar if it seems too dry, and finally, bake at 350 F.  Leave it uncovered
    if you want some crunch, or covered if you're going for moist.\r\n\r\n*If you
    didn't have any walnut oil for the mix, but you do have sesame oil, you could
    add some of that; but I'd wait until it came out of the oven since sesame oil
    doesn't hold its flavour very well when heated.\r\n\r\nHmmm .... You could add
    some black beans to the mix, if you feel like going for a sort of meal in one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere.
    \r\n\r\nSorry Joe.\r\n\r\nGod Bless us everyone.\r\n"

    wouldn't have said that as generally, but in this case totally agree.\r\nThis
    is a help request from somebody who has been using Typophile for [lots of] type
    IDs, and on occasion also needs IDs on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59300\">guns</a>,
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/65047\">vector illustrations</a>, and now,
    flags. So <em>artslons</em> uses this place purely as a help resource, and as
    such I can see how Typophile <em>must</em> define itself as the place that is
    about type. Because I'm sure there's Gunnophile and Flagophile out there, too,
    and they wouldn't want to hear (or know too much) about fonts."

    This thread could very easily be solved with a little flag encyclopaedia and I
    think it is lazy to post here. Because of this, and that it is not type related
    I'm inclined to agree with Nina. However I sometimes know that the Typophile community
    can solve many specific problems that are not type related, simply because this
    is a collection of intelligent and well meaning people and I'm sure that is what
    John is talking about. It's pretty obvious however when it is a sincere request,
    a translation or some background information, and usually there is a lot of opportunity
    to talk type in relation. I don't really see that here.\r\n\r\nI just think this
    is a particularly lazy post as are the others mentioned by Nina. \r\nSorry, there
    has been so much spam lately and this is not really much better.\r\n"

    course not. What I meant is that a mere label shouldn't justify striking down
    a person for wanting to preserve -what he sees as- this place's integrity. This
    place is different for each of us; but it can only be healthy if we think beyond
    our selves.\r\n\r\nAnd \"artslons\" should consider whether it's worth getting
    on the bad side of a good chunk of people in a place, just to get answers to questions
    that are <em>easier</em> to get answers to, with no friction, elsewhere. I think
    the least everybody should do is give him that advice. Except people who <em>want</em>
    to see this place become more sociable <em>and</em> less typographic... Nothing
    mixes with anything else completely.\r\n\r\n> bring the post on-topic in a creative
    way\r\n\r\nGood suggestion!\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the two that come to mind are
    neighbors!\r\n\r\n- The Iraqi flag, which had a really clunky \"allahu akbar\"
    added by Saddaam Husein (in his own handwriting?); it was spliced in when he realized
    his usefulness to the West was over. Interestingly the West didn't implement a
    return to the previous flag; they rendered a nice kufi style (although I think
    it's still lame).\r\n\r\n- The supremely subtle and tasteful \"allahu akbar\"
    in the Iranian flag, rendered continuously in thin lines, in \"bitmap\". Wow.\r\nhttp://blog.kir.com/archives/images/iran_flag.png\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
