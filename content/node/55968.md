body: "Hello everyone, i'm in need of some help.\r\n\r\nI am designing a logo for
  a friend of mine that started an educational consulting firm. The original name
  was Arise! Talitha Koum (which I thought was too long but...) the 2nd half is Hebrew
  and refers to a girl of 12 which held special meaning to her. She gave in and has
  finally changed her original name to Arise Educational Consulting, Inc.\r\n\r\nThe
  variations I attached were based on what she wanted originally, which was uplifting
  hands that signified strength in the colors green and/or brown.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for a font that would signify excellence and strength without being too overpowering
  (if that is possible) because she writes curriculums and training plans for schools
  and businesses.\r\n\r\nCritique on the ideas/direction are welcome, no matter how
  brutal. I appreciate honesty and i'm a bit new to the logo design thing. Thanks
  in advance for any insight."
