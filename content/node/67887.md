  find online about creating a condensed font from a normal width font.\r\nI'm looking
  to create a condensed font and I'm wondering if there are best practise percentage
  that the font should be condensed by and if the different weights are condensed
  by the same percentage.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nRr"

    it you can decide to call it condensed, compressed, narrow, or something else.\r\n\r\nBut
    it really should be something you like or think will be useful."

    having to extremes, one regular and one bold, make an interpolation ONLY in the
    horizontal axis. The resulting font is a good starting point for a condensed version.
    Cheers.'

    MM width Axis</cite> macro, which is part of the Font Remix Tools: http://remix-tools.com.
    There is also a video on the website.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the question
    which weights (also interesting: which glyphs) are typicaly condensed how much
    compared to the others then you might find the PDF on the \"About\" page interesting,
    which presents some research I have done on that subject."
