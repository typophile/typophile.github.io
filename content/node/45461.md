  know the source). It's called \"A2 Happiness Bold\" and it looks like:http://users.pandora.be/xinavane/hffont.png
  (more on coke.be)\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have a lot of extra characters included, so
  I was wondering if this font were based on some other font. An 'original' which
  could include more characters and wheights.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks"

    Olins</a>, an advertising bureau. Perhaps they have a connection to the Coca-Cola
    campagin.
