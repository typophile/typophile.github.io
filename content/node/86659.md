body: "Hello Typophyles,\r\n\r\nI am currently working on an Arabic font. Its glyphs
  number has reached to several hundereds and still a very large work is ahead. \r\nTill
  yet the glyphs in my font are in a very very irregularl manner. I make Glyphs in
  FontLab and add OT Tables through MS Volt. I want to regularly arrange my glyphs
  in the font but it will take a very long time to make a new Fontlab file and copy
  all glyphs one by one and then enter the name for every glyph and its Unicode Value.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a way to move glyph in a fontlab file from one place to another position (one
  by one) in such a way that glyph's name and unicode values also move along with
  it to the new position. I have tried in Fontlab (1) by dragging and (2) also by
  cut and paste but the glyphs name and Unicode Values are affected. What will be
  the easiest way for this job in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nPlease also recommend any other
  software if that software has easier way.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    the name and unicode value -- while in codepages mode, use the 'append glyph'
    command rather than the paste command and as long as the name or unicode value
    don't conflict with anything in the destination font they will be preserved.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
