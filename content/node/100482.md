  whole of Europe and am trying to find some nice fonts. I originally used Chevalier
  and Samantha Italic Pro on pack but the products are headed for Russia and Poland
  as well, so I'm trying to find any nice alternatives. Does anyone know of any nice
  cyrillic and diacritic fonts out there? I've looked on Paratype and spoken to people
  at Monotype and Linotype but thought someone out there in typo land might know of
  something. I'd appreciate any help.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nGiles "

    to Samantha that supports Cyrillic shouldn't be too hard. But Chevalier is probably
    a harder nut to crack... If you have enough time (and a decent budget :-) consider
    commissioning a custom extension. There are many people on Typophile who can do
    that sort of thing for you (hopefully they'll chime in) including J\xFCrgen, and
    yours truly: hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
