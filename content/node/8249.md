body: Hi <BR>I&#39;m using Fontlab 4.6 in MacOSX, and I have a Light weight and a
  Black weight of a font &#40;T1&#41;, with their kerning and metrics adjusted. I
  want to generate 3 intermediate weights &#40;Book, Medium, Bold&#41; using weight
  axis, but I don&#39;t want to generate a MM font. When I generate them &#40;I define
  a weight axis for each of them, then I assign the light axis to the black axis,
  and from the black weight I generate an instance&#41;, the kerning and metrics values
  stay the same of one of the masters &#40;the black axis in this case&#41;. Will
  I have to adjust kerning and metrics again for each intermediate weight? Is there
  a way to increase or decrease metrics and kerning values proportionally, just as
  occurs to the weight? <BR>Thank you!
