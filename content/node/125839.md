body: Trying to match these three fonts a little closer if possible. The first part,
  "WHISKEY RANCH," is similar to High Country or High Noon. However, I'm looking for
  something wider and/or shorter. The second font is the first letters in "COUNTRY
  SPORTS SALOON," which appears to be close to Thankful Display Filigree, but narrower.
  The rest of the "COUNTRY SPORTS SALOON" looks like IFC Railroad but the R and T
  are different. I know I am being anal about this but I try to match the fonts as
  close as possible when I am making posters for my band. If anyone knows of any fonts
  that are a closer match I would be forever grateful. And, might I add that it is
  great to have typophile back after a long hiatus. thanks in advance.
