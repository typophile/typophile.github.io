  GD with no luck. Sorry about the cross posting.\r\n\r\nThis font is Galahad. On
  a TV show I saw credits in a caps font that had an an A with a left bar like Galahad.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a name for the bar?\r\n\r\nWhat other fonts have an A with a bar on the left
  side of the A? (Or the right side?)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_4343_6545.jpg]"

  body: "Hm. The closest I know would be something with a half-<em>serif</em> on top
    (which isn't going to be as long as this), for example there is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/cg_accolade_complete_pack/\">Accolade</a>.
    That or use something with a full bar and chop half of that off\u2026 sorry not
    to be of more help."
