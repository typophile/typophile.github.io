  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Friends

I'm looking for a face along the lines of Adobe Garamond, Jenson, or Centaur that features an <em>at</em> ligature. Would any of you know of such a face?

Specifically, I'm trying to do a masterful job in setting the name "Beatrice," so I'm very interested in any ideas you may have for setting this name. The client is a marriage and family therapist.

Thanks to Christopher Lewis from myfonts.com for tuning me into this fontastic resource of typographic knowledge and exploration!

		<div class="commentbody">I looked at <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/esta/>Esta</a> and <a href=http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PMEJLigR.html>Mrs Eaves</a>, two with lots of ligatures that I knew off the top of my head, but neither had it. Mrs Eaves is known as the "ligature queen" and it doesn't have one, so I'm not sure if you're going to have much luck. But I hope I'm wrong.

If you can't find one but are still wedded to the idea of an at ligature, you may need to do it yourself in Illustrator or FontLab. You could either take a ct ligature and move the join to the at, or take the tail of the a and attach it to the t. Actually, looking at the Mrs Eaves ligatures font, you could switch an e for a t in the ae ligature, but you'd probably either have to lower the crossbar of the t or raise the bowl of the a to make a straight horizontal connection.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At first I thought you meant something to do with '@'. Silly. 

Now that I get you, here's the thing: ligatures are there to solve typgraphic problems and the cobination 'at' isn't one of these classic problems. So I don't think you will find a face with that ligature already made. 

You can make your own but unless you do it carefully it will jump out like a sore thumb. 

This 'Beatrice', will it be in running text or is it a logo? If it's in running text it might be more 'masterful' to loose the ligature. ;-) If it's a logo or something else then that might make more sense. 

Maybe you should look at the ligatures that made for KPN by Pieter van Rosmalen. They walk the line between decoration/embelishment & success in semi-running text. Maybe he would make your ligature for you. Or you could ask around here. 

Here is a link http://www.caketype.com/custom_kpn.html

Maybe you should sketch what you have in mind & post an image.</div>

I agree. However I don't think that it CANNOT be done well. But it will be hard. Very hard.

Brian, good for you for giving it a shot! Here's my crit. I think the crossbar on the t & the tail below need to be exagerated a bit more. You have lost half th 't' so you need to compensate for it a little to make sure it reads as immediately as possible. Also there are some spacing issues with the other letters but that's probably how the font came. Yes?

I won't promise that you will ever get there. But I don't think it's a good idea to say 'never'. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that there's no <em>reason</em>, and I've personally never used ligatures myself other than the 'standard' ones like fi, fl, and the like. In modern use, there is no real reason to use ligatures besides that of clashing shapes. I find the ct and st ligatures for example way too distracting and too culture-specific.

But it's fun to look at mediaeval texts using ligatures where adjacent letters share stems or bowls as space-savers and to try to decipher them. There's no clash between the a and the t, but I tried playing the mediaeval scribe for fun.

Eben, thanks for the crit. I actually drew the letters from scratch just to set 'Beatrice'; they don't come from an existing design. As you probably suspected, I drew the a and the t separately and just hacked and sewed them up. I have now modified the letters a bit following your suggestion.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beatrice2_5180.jpg]
I think it does read better, although it still demonstrates how foreign the mediaeval conjoined-at-the-stem ligature is to the modern eye.</div>

<cite> There’s no REASON to be chickenshit afraid of ligation. </cite>

Except fear of abject failure. Doing it well is tough. If you have a deadline or some other reason that makes it impractical it maybe isn't the best plan. On the other hand if you have time to play in - you can't do anything well unless you do it alot. So I say ligate to your hearts' content. Upsetting the apple cart ( and then fixing it) is a good way of finding out how the apple cart works.</div>

I think it'd be absolutely perfect if the <em>a</em> had just a touch of a stem on it (just before the connector begins its ascent to the <em>t</em>.

Alessandro, how much would you charge me for an EPS version of your script <em>Beatrice</em>? I don't think it'd work for a marriage therapist, but if my wife and I have a daughter, we're considering naming her Beatrice. For the main logo of my (perhaps future) daughter's photos (Web) pages, I cannot imagine her name being better expressed. That's real art there, fine sir!

I see a "dberlow" online. Could that be <em>the</em> David Berlow, the one who designed Throhand?

Wouldn't this design call for a tall x-height?

In Berlow's Throhand it'd take one heck of a steep connector to get from the top of the bowl of the <em>a</em> to the <em>t</em>'s crossbar. (By the way, if <em>crossbar</em> isn't the correct term, please enlighten me.)

I want the base font on which this logo is based to have the Victorian discipline and prissiness of Adobe Garamond, Jenson, Centaur, or Throhand, none of which features a tall x-height.

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with your critique is not that you are somehow 'wrong'. I just think one of the the assumptions you seem to be making may inhibit the optimal success of this kind of ligature: the assumption being that whole parts of the letters may be able to stay rigid or intact. in the process. In order to make my rough samples look even sorta kinda okay, I had to give the crossbar more weight so it could better compete for attention with the arcs, and I had to shorten the tail of the t. Better still to put all the elements in play! If you leave the bowl on the way to the t at an angle you may be able to straigten it out by the end. Or you might find an arc shape works better. 

But if there is one thing I keep bumping into over & over again as I design type it's the reality that every part relates and has to be seen in the context of every other part, feature or aspect. So it stands to reason that you might have to rethink the whole thing. Who knows maybe the over shoot in the top of the a will look good if it's made a bit taller to make room for the arc <cite>in the context of the rest of it...</cite></div>

On a slightly unrelated note, Jaddie, I've been wondering why the tittle (I've never used that word before) of the i is so high. When I looked at the sample of Throhand of the Font Bureau site, the reason became clear: it's because the x-height is low, and the high tittle balances the i when it is near ascending letters. But in this sample, because the only ascending letter is the B, the high tittle seems out of place. I'd suggest lowering it to a less evident spot. </div>

But reading your post again, maybe you meant that it's only noticed when someone looks at the letters out of context.

Returning to Jaddie's case, Hrant, wouldn't you agree that in this case, setting "Beatrice," the tittle should be lowered? Visually, to me, it jumps out as distracting.</div>

You're right - I was unclear: only other type designers are expected
to comment (and only they have actually commented). If a layman
comments on it, then the tittle must be huge.

Yes, I think in this case (mostly because it's a single word, and in essence
no longer glyphs of a font) the tittle should be lower, and also larger.

I don't know if anybody has brought this up, but the important question is why have an "at" ligature? A question not based on a general dislike of ligatures, but one based on a like of focused purpose.

I presume it's because of some sort of separation/joining between the two parts of the name, both in terms of syllabification as well as the fact that "Bea" is the common short form. So maybe a ligation is not the only way to mark this; maybe a flourished "a" would be better - something like this:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_6255.gif]

Sort of like a subtle, engrained hyphen.
BTW, in such a scheme I might abridge the left part of the crossbar of the "t".

Thank you very much for your help! I'll experiment a bit more and do my best to incorporate your thoughts and ideas into a semi-final design. Beatrice herself might have some sort of idea that I haven't thought of.

aleksander, I really like your two suggestions and prefer the second because it seems to have a little bit more flow and looks a little more feminine.
