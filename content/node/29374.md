  photos have been taken with my cell phone from my laptop's screen\u2026 (pure posh,
  I know). I found these pictures online and now I can't recall where I found it.
  If anyone has a clue about the original online resource, please let me know. I you
  can have fun IDing it, that's fine as well :) Unlimited recognition reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBigger

    old book\u2026 maybe spanish, maybe from 18th century. Nothing digital in here
    :) Thanks nonetheless"

    capitals in Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's 1523 writing manual, Il Modo de
    Temperare le Penne.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe that opens another direction \u2026\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Ok, didn't refresh, you have already found it. "

  body: The same pages are reproduced in Tschichold's Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering
    and he says they are taken from Vicentino's 1523 textbook "Il modo de temperare
    la Penne ...". He has enlarged and retouched them. This is presumably the source
    for these photos.
