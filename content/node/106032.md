body: Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me identify this font, or suggest something
  like it as an alternative. I've been looking online all weekend, and the font recognition
  software can't recognize the characters because of the textured background.  THANKS!

  body: "Very nice lettering. A simple edit of the title to remove distractions:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MickyXmasCarolBW_5895.jpg]\r\nThis
    is a nice pastiche of some circa 1900 lettering styles. Note the big bowl on R
    similar to University Roman; the high waist E and H similar to Eccentric; the
    tilde shapes (a.k.a) cyma or flames from the A [a feature discussed in a previous
    thread: http://typophile.com/node/103815]; and the U shape at the center of the
    crossbars of A and H.\r\nDisney animators were perfectly capable of making their
    own titles based on historic features or samples with consistent execution of
    matching letters.\r\nBut perhaps this has in fact been done as a font. Anyone?\r\nDon"

  body: "For a font with a similar flavor try Denis Masharov's revival of the typeface
    \"Glass Antiqua\" by the Genzsch & Heyse foundry in 1913, which was designed by
    Franz Paul Glass, Munich. http://typophile.com/node/76563 Sorry, no flaming A's.\r\nDon"
