    U is probably your standard issue Helvetica or Univers."

    just take a stab at and say Gill Sans. I'm still looking for a match. I have a
    feeling I should check in standard system fonts."

    for the U, it's a bit short for Helvetica."

    body: "Great! Thanks Geoff and Isaac. \r\nYeah I think it is pre-digital Bembo.
      \r\nGeoff, you are right about the t is slightly different. \r\nDo you know
      who produced the closest digital version to the original? \r\nWho is a renowned
      foundry who produces type strict to originals? \r\nThanks!"

    to imply the designer of this cover altered the forms.\r\n\r\n> Do you know who
    produced the closest digital version to the original? \r\n> Who is a renowned

    they recently released a digital version called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo-book/\">Bembo
    Book</a>, it looks quite good for text but I haven't used nor seen how it looks
    on paper."
