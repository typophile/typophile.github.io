I am trying to learn as much as possible about logo design... it is really interesting

this is my first logo, give me your thoughts

first... what do you think of the idea?  ok? good?... or under average?

then, the font... I always find a huge problem when it comes to fonts

it is something experimental... so feel free to say anything might help me to improve
my learning process

thanks in advance


there are new designs in the second folder... have a look plz</div>

You could play with the eye/perception and in this way create a visual reflection – linking with the ability to manage. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Perception_3431.jpg]

Using this above, or not... but the o in Dot is also a 'dot'. But I'm sure you've seen that.

Which do U want to emphasise? ability to manage or the unique name 'Dot'?</div>

Of all those logos, the third one down appeals to me the most, but I think you probably need to keep going with it and develop it more.

Also is it me or is the O in dot doing odd things? And I think you need to tighten up the space between the first a and the first n in management.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Also...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DotsInOrder_5905.jpg]
it is intersting to know that the size/distance of a space between items is what makes our brains group them together.
Again this could be used to reflect the ability to manage 'things'.
I'm very fascinated by perception. The eye sees, but it transmits different information to the brain. One kind of information is the info about size, shape, colour and alike. The other is orientation, where it's placed and it's position in relation to other objects.
That's is why illusions confuses us.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you're onto something with the first logo. However you need to work on the placement of the dots within the letters - on screen the center of the o looks off-center and the dot of the t looks a bit wonky (yep, that's a technical term!). I would suggest using a dot in the center of the d as well to see how that looks.</div>

love your nickname... it plays with perception.. also reminds me of mine ;)


about the 0 in dot.... I tried to take advantage but I gave up... 

visual perception...  a good way to start again... I think this may bring some thoughts.... ok one thing i have to ask about.... what is the link between perception & managing? do you mean that a good perception leads to god managing?

for the logos i did... all of them deals with the name of dot... now i will work on the other side youve mentioned... management 

aha aha... now i get you ... you mean the ability to connect dots for example = the ability to manage and understand..... 

thanks for the precious advices ... this is what i had in college ' cognition '... thanks alot you have been really helpful




peter

which one is the third down? i should add numbers....sorry

sure... i will work on it & show you the results

also i will try to work on the O .......... thnx alot

		<div class="commentbody">top right: 
the grey-dot-name has same colour as the background bar, therefore belongs/has a relationship with it. The bar bar is curved (here only in one end) and it could be understood as being a 'slice' of a massive dot.

Black bar with grey name:
was an earlier stage. And experimenting with the dot, as a dot only. And a thought that missing letters rarely is an obstical in reading, one often 'fill in' the missing parts in order to make up a meaning.

Black dot: 
just as it is, using same process as above.

Next 3:
Playing with the negative space in the d. And funny enough.. placed behind it, and moved a bit - it's an door opening inwards for the viewer. A nice welcome I thought, maybe not appropriate... U know.

Last 4:
the grey ink-dot could on all items produced be placed at a different position. The Biz card might have the dot below the name, the letterhead above, the comp-slip behind it and so on... managing the dot in reality. I made it 'ink-like' to create a contrast to the typed out name, to add life and emotion/excitement.

		<div class="commentbody">Why didn't you try epsilons suggestion, to change "g" into two dots. I think it may be the best one. and above it you could also position the word dot so that o becomes a dot and creates a three dot pattern vertically with that double dot g.

Worth a try?

#4 in the second batch may be the strongest one but it doesn't look that professional to my eyes. Probably because of the typography choice. Probably. I would use lighter weight, but lighter weights wouldn't work with this kind of mark.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think that any of these actually work... Most of them are too busy to me. I was more looking into simplifying it than overcomplicating. I had something like this in mind (I know it's always bad to show what you think, but here I had to do it. YOu can use it anyway you want it if you like it)
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dot-management_6130.jpg]

Now looking at this image I can see that the last "dot" should have it's shape tweaked, because it doesn't look the same to the first two. Visual perception. :) Anyway. It's a mockup and it should be treated that way too.

It is not late at all....
This mark makes me want to stare at it for a while.... it feels that there is something happening to the dot in the middle... right?
I love it too.....thnx
