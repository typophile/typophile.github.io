    you can't post a subject line like that, it's too general. I am doing fine but
    so many people need help, \"the designers of the future will be the personal coach,
    the gym trainer, the diet consultant, &c.\u201D"

  body: "Thank you, David, that's a nice idea \u2014\u2014 I am getting married in
    June and this also requires some coffee to be consumed in Izmir, it's not that
    I am running out of coffee (well, if you designers want to help the groom with
    some gold), but still, maybe you would like to give a seminar to my students/department
    this end or next Fall, write me offline \u2014\u2014 I might come to Mimar Sinan
    for Grafist, not sure yet.\r\nKor Sok Khiang, sorry about that."
