  body: "Hi Dan\r\n\r\nAs it says in the article, such contractual small print is
    only unreadable because the originator doesn't want the end-user to read it. Other
    instances of small print can be perfectly readable; the x-height of the body type
    in the following image is about .6mm, and it was photographically reduced from
    a larger set size to get it down to this (<em>\u2018A Book is Made\u2019</em>
    printed by Jarrold & Sons, Norwich, UK for an exhibition by the Federation of
    Master Printers in the 1980s). Apologies for the picture quality.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-Book-is-Made_scan_4078.jpg]"
