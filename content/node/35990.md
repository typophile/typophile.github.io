  self-publishing project. The final product will be an e-book, or simply a pdf file.
  The topic is environmental law, policy and activism, and the audience is very diverse.
  The language is (modern) Greek, but some quotes and bibliography  might be in  English
  or  French, and a bi-lingual edition would also be desirable in the future (hence,
  we need essentially a bi-lingual typeface). I have chosen MinionPro for the text
  - partly because it is available, partly for readability and elegance (with Sabon
  a close second). I am looking for a sans-serif font for headlines and titles...I
  have considered Memorandum and Veto (but they do not offer Greek), as well as Myriad
  Pro (which is still an option), but I suspect there are other choices ....Please
  consider also cost (no more than 30-40 euros, so it has to be a bold typeface that
  is sold separately), and feel free to suggest other font combinations. Thanks.\r\n\r\nP.S.
  On second thought, do I need a separate font for headlines?\r\n\r\n"

    it might be helpful to find something in your criteria range. I would use Minion
    Pro for everything. Use italic for headlines or the small caps. If I'm right,
    you even have swashes to use for a more decorative feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    (aka \"Display\") version, along with a \"Subhead\" version. Combining Minion
    & Myriad is \"quite common\" in several senses of the term.\r\n\r\nBut if you
    must have a sans, some of the fonts at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.greekfontsociety.org/pages/en_typefaces1.html\r\n\r\nhave
    a Latin character set as well as Greek, and there are one or two in a Sans style.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    extreme in design. Syntax, ITC Stone Sans, Lucida Sans, are among the more \"traditional\"
    possibilities.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
