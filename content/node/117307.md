    [[http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-468943p1.html|portfolio]] (or [[http://atwork.lv/users/takeone|here]])
    could confirm it.\r\n'Forgives' reminds me a bit of Great Lakes lettering [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/great-lakes-lettering/asterism|Asterism]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/great-lakes-lettering/feast|Feast]].\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/sepian|Sepian]]
    might work for 'I dont'.\r\nHaving a look to fonts tagged '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Atattoo|tattoo]]'
    might worth a shot."
