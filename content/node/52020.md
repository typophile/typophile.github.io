  body: "You can get pretty close to the TIROL AUSTRIA lettering with Avant Garde
    Gothic Light, using an upside-down V for the A. The INNSBRUCK lettering is close
    to Mark Simonson's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/changeling/|Changeling]],
    and probably many SciFi/Techno fonts. Offhand that's my best alternate suggestion.\r\n\r\n-
