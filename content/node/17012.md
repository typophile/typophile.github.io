body: "DULUTH, MN - Michael Browers, a Duluth based designer, announced today that
  he has entered into an agreement with MyFonts.com, a font distributor based in Cambridge,
  MA, for the distribution of his typefaces online. Michael\u2019s first two font
  releases are Formasi and Isoglyphics.\r\n\r\nFormasi, Azeri for \"Form of,\" resulted
  from the concept of a civil war between serif and sanserif. Formasi is intended
  to be the result of the aftermath of such a war.\r\n\r\nIsoglyphics was initially
  concepted as a rip on Otto Neurath and the resulting movement towards icons as visual
  language. However, the final design evolved into visual commentary and satire of
  contemporary culture through the resulting 94 icons.\r\n\r\nThe fonts may be purchased
  online at http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/michaelbrowers/.\r\n\r\nMichael Browers
  is the Graphic Designer/Project Manager for Ikonics Corporation. Additionally, he
  offers freelance logo and type design. More information about his work can be found
  at\r\nhttp://www.michaelbrowers.com\r\n"
