		<div class="commentbody">Will. To be perfectly honest, I think your typeface is horrible. That is, some of the effects are very nice, but it seems to me it’s <em>all</em> effect and <em>nada</em> substance. I can’t believe you are actually selling this! Or, actually: I have no doubt you <em>can</em> sell it (you know, people are horses), but how on earth you are going to <em>live with yourself</em> afterwards beats me.

Looking at your website, I was thoroughly impressed by your reimagination of the InDesign font menu. You’ve clearly been thinking a lot about how it could be improved. Why not devote the same attention to your type design? Read stuff! Study the masters! Don’t churn out whatever. Do the best you possibly can, and spend the years it takes to get there. Anything else is just a waste of time.

(Maybe I’m just misunderstanding a faux naïve thing …)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To be a bit more specific: Your letters lack (some) basic optical corrections (like for example thinning of joints), but appears to have others (like overshot). Your curves are poorly drawn (look at transitions from straight line to curve; uneven edges where they should be smooth) and especially your circular shapes suffer. Most internal shapes appears to follow the external shapes closely (or vice versa) which makes me believe you started with a skeleton and applied a stroke, leading to problems like the strongly ellipse shaped counter in ‘o’ (this needs to be more squarish) and a sagging right edge of ‘n’ etc. And then there’s ‘s’, with thinning, a fairly good spine — the odd one out. The letters themselves are poorly balanced, and the spacing is uneven and I don’t understand the point in providing a bold when it is so close in weight to the regular. 

Even after that long tirade, there’s still nothing in here that is particularly exciting or new. It seems to be a common misconception that making something “neutral” is easy. On the contrary.

		<div class="commentbody">Will, I seldom post here — I'm still a beginner, so I mostly read what others more advanced have to share — but your last reply that says "I know there's still a lot of work to be done, and I'm constantly tweaking these fonts" makes me wonder what's in some peoples' head (and also how young and immature are you):

Yes, fonts have a version number, like software programs, so they can be updated with small corrections (correctly aligning a misaligned diacritical mark, for example, 'cause everybody makes small mistakes), but what do you mean "constantly tweaking these fonts"?!? Like "the shape of the letters of the fonts I already put on sale on MyFonts.com will change with time, when I get more professional with this font design thing"?   I can't believe some people think like that!

(Also… what Frode said 110%).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would also be more beneficial for the users if you were to cover a complete Euro-Latin character set (at least). For instance, a polish user can do next to nothing with this typeface. A restriction to the basic Western repertoire seems fairly outdated, i.m.h.o.</div>
