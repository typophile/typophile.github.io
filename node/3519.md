  for personal use and tinkering mostly, with the occasional freelance gig. Because
  I don&#39;t have big budgets to throw around, I look for inexpensive fonts to satisfy
  my cravings. For example, two of my favorites are shown below: Monteverdi and Montrachet
  from Fountain &#40;by Lars Bergquist&#41; and Antique Modern from the Storm Type
  Foundry. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/28246.gif"
  alt="Type sample"> <BR> <BR>To me, finding these fonts was like discovering a treasure
  in a flea market -- and Mr. Bergquist and Mr. Storm are no amateurs, so I feel these
  are beautifully crafted products. <BR> <BR>I guess my point is there are great fonts
  for $100 and there are great fonts for $1,000 &#40;and up!&#41;. I&#39;d like to
  hear more background on the smaller foundries and lone practitioners of type design
  who produce these treasures -- or just see what kinds of discussions this prompts.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison'

  body: Thats the reason the Indie font books were created to expose the talents of
    the smaller foundries and less exposed designers &#40;many who haunt this site&#41;.
    I have both the Indie font books and recommend them to anyone.

  body: I think the pair makes a very nice set. And while the Dutch Type Library is
    a &#34;legendary&#34; provider or historical text fonts, Mr. Bergquist&#39;s contributions
    are great for people like me who can only drool over DTL Fleischmann. I read comments
    on Storm&#39;s work fairly frequently &#40;which I agree is amazing&#41;, but
    I hear few or no comments on designers like Mr. Bergquist and Mario Feliciano,
    or the digitizations of Goudy&#39;s fonts by Gerald Giampa. Does a lower price
    make a font any less well-crafted? <BR> <BR>For instance, Goudy and Van Krimpen
    are both historic figures in type design. DTL Haarlemmer, a Van Krimpen revival,
    is $1,620. Lanston&#39;s revival of Goudy&#39;s Kennerley type is $185. Robert
    Bringhurst called Lanston Kennerley an &#34;excellent digital version.&#34; Any
    thoughts? &#40;I am most certainly not bashing DTL --  their work is beautiful
    and probably worth every penny.&#41; <BR> <BR>I apologize if I didn&#39;t label
    this thread clearly. I feel like I&#39;m veering off...

  body: I agree on the indie font books, since discovery of them a while ago; and
    exploring the foundries in them. well lets just say my respect for craftsmanship
    by people who are doing it with love. that is where all of the best come from.

  body: Daniel, those Indie books are exactly what turned me on to these guys. I have
    them both as well -- they&#39;re great resources. <BR> <BR>-&#62; many who haunt
    this site <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;m hoping to hear some of these ghosts talk more
    about their work.

  body: Hi, Kris. By personal use, I mean I&#39;ll redesign my resume, my website,
    or make poetry books for my wife -- things like that. The firm I work for purchases
    their own type, so any type I purchase I use to make things for myself. &#40;If
    you were just joking with me, sorry I missed it... I&#39;m still not quite awake.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>BTW, Peter Bruhn of Fountain seems to be a really nice guy. His emails
    -- and posts on this site -- are very polite and friendly &#40;Fountain is the
    friendly foundry&#41;. <BR> <BR>Mr. Storm and I have also corresponded via email
    and he is just as kind. I had an historical typeface website for a while where
    I linked to a few of his types. He contacted me out of the blue -- it was very
    cool!

  body: Yeah haha I was making funny. I get exactly the same impression from Fountain
    - polite and friendly, without being silly. The quality of type seems excellent
    &#40;I&#39;ve never purchased&#41; and the pricing is also very reasonable - friendly,
    even. <BR> <BR>kris.
