  in the book &#34;Kleur&#34; &#40;designed by Corina Cotorobai/Werkplaats Typografie&#41;.
  I don&#39;t have any scans yet, but here you can see the cover: <a href="http://www.nijhoflee.nl/img2/zoom/2200000000477.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://www.nijhoflee.nl/img2/zoom/2200000000477.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>It
  seems like a crossover from Avenir &amp; AG. <BR>One very strange thing was the
  uppercase J which was shaped like the one in AG schoolbook, with a bar on top. <BR>
  <BR>'

    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-706/" target="_blank">
    Geometric 706</a>, so that&#39;s more like the Futura equivalent.

  body: I&#39;d sure like to see a few more letters so I could use the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
    target="_blank">Sans ID Guide</a> on it. Yves, your Neuzeit guess looks good in
    Test Drive, but we don&#39;t know enough with those letters, especially because
    the &#39;r&#39; is hard to see very well &#40;for my eyes&#41;.

  body: I agree. All I had to go with was the description  <BR>&#34;Avenir with uc
    &#39;J&#39; with bar on top&#34;, and the fact  <BR>that by experience I know
    that Dutch designers  <BR>really like to use DINs, OCRs, Neuzeits and the  <BR>likes.

  body: hmmm, I&#39;ll try to find a scan somewhere. I don&#39;t have the book here
    but I think the neuzeit S is a perfect match. Yves is right about the dutch preferences
    ;-&#41; <BR>dankjewel!
