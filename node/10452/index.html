  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Type design seems to usually be a solitary venture (I can understand why&hellip; :-), but not always, and I wonder how teams of type designers tend to function when working on a single design. Most of the few cases where numerous designers have worked on a single font have been grunge/experimental projects (like that MetaDesign thing - I forget the name now), but I think the scenario where a small (and strongly structured - necessarily?) team works on a text face is most interesting. <BR> <BR>For obvious reasons, the following would be a great case-study at Typophile: <BR> <BR>Miller was worked on by Matthew Carter, Tobias Frere-Jones and Cyrus Highsmith. Could we possibly get some insight into the dynamics, like who did what part of the whole task, what logistical issues arose, etc.? I'm betting it could be very educational. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To me, the most interesting thing is trying to create a nice font that's usable for display and short text, with as many people as logistically possible. Here's a rough proposal: <BR> <BR>1. Appoint an Overall Authority: this person will have final say in everything, without necessarily participating in the design, or even explicitly offering his/her opinion. The three qualities this person must have in abundance are: an understanding of type design; fairness; a willingness to allow -even motivate- people to make something he personally might not like. <BR> <BR>2. Decide the general nature of the typeface. Is it a grotesque sans, a joined script, a Garalde, what? Once this is decided, some people will want to participate in the design, and others won't. <BR> <BR>3. Make a list of tasks that a type designer does, with as many subdivisions as we have participants. <BR> <BR>4. Define the Pert-chart, which is basically the sequential dependence of the various tasks (eg: Kerning comes after Spacing). Also define how the various tasks are related (eg: the rough spacing is done by the person doing [some of] the letterforms, but the final spacing is done afterwards by somebody else; or that the person doing the Kerning has to spend some &quot;quality time&quot; with the guy who did the Spacing). <BR> <BR>5. Assign each sub-task to an individual, make sure everybody's communicating with who he/she needs to communicate with, and manage the project to completion. <BR> <BR>6. Become filthy rich through record sales never before seen in the font world&hellip;  ;-) <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raining on your parade: <BR>I can't imagine this working very well. I don't think there have been many precedents for type design by committee/collaboration of more than two people. <BR>Having said that though, it might be fun for some of the participants and instructive for the organisers, and there's no harm done. So go for it! <BR>My suggestion on how to start would be this: <BR>Don't start from absolutely square one. Participants should throw into the hat unfinished/barely started projects that have been shelved for one reason or another. Upload samples like in the Critique Discussion area and discuss the merits of each prospect and go from there. I for one have a handful of designs with potential that I will never ever finish, and I dare say a lot of people here have good projects that they might not develop. I think this would be a far better way to get the project going than to debate sans grotesque versus serif display/whatever.  <BR> <BR>Oh, and choose something fairly easy to start off with, otherwise there will never be a second Typophile multi-collaborative font.</div>
