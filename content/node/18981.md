    body: Chris, you may be right. Do you know of any fonts that have a similar 'R'?

    is a squarish sans with an R whose leg comes off the bowl.

  body: Conduit is the closest I've found. I'm not aware of a type with such low crossbars,
    on the "A" "E" and "R." I also searched Lineto and Acme Fonts, but nothing. Maybe
    this type was customized for the client?

  body: In a desperate effort to secure my 2nd positive type identification, I am
    posting this comparison which will show that the "G" and "O" are exact matches,
    and therefore we can only conclude that this is, indeed, Conduit Bold customized.
    Top image is the original image (cropped), 2nd image is Conduit Bold (in yellow),
    3rd image is both images overlapping for comparison. Your honor, I rest my case.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conduit.jpg]

  body: Nice work, Chris. It's an improvement. I always found Conduit's waist too
    high.

  body: Thank you, thank you... I like Conduit a lot, but I can see now your point
    Stephen about the waist being too high.

  body: The customisation makes sense, as it's quite easy to do with a straight-sided
    sans. Good eye, Chris, this one has your name on it.
