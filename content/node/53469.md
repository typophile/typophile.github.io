  body: "That is \"Moderne Pica Block, Ra 280\" by Alfred Ransmayer & Albert Rodrian
    Vereinigte Typenfabriken, Berlin.\r\n\r\nIs that your own website, with the question
    about the typeface, or should I send him an e-mail? :)\r\n\r\nThe typeface was
    available for different models of typewriters. You could choose a typeface when
    ordering a typewriter, the types were then soldered to the typebars at the factory.
    Of course they couldn't be exchanged later.\r\n\r\nI have an old catalogue from
    1940 which lists the typeface, I hadn't seen a full character set before though.\r\n\r\nJens"
