  yet be able to use it for wider editorial design, especially the collateral for
  your books, Clifford poses real problems. Yes, it has a beautiful oldstyle look
  without hitting you over the head, but none of its optical weights comes with bold
  or bold italic, and you know that your book manuscript (especially nonfiction) will
  require one or both somewhere, and that your collateral pieces certainly will.\r\n\r\nDeep
  in the bowels of Linotype, I have discovered a text family that solves those problems:
  LINOTYPE REALLY at $126 for a four-font family, all of which are keystroke-linked,
  unlike Clifford's fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LTReally_6200.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clifford18_5101.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cliffordnine_3864.png]\r\n\r\nLinotype
  Really has the same subtle oldstyle feel as Clifford eighteen or nine, and it's
  clean and large. Really's letter proportions are nice and wide whereas Clifford
  forces you to choose between the cleaner but more condensed eighteen versus the
  wider but blacker/clunkier nine optical weight. \r\n\r\nWhile Really's italics are
  not as funky as Clifford's, Really's oldstyle figures are much more stylish, especially
  the one and four. An undiscovered gem: Linotype Really. Try it!"
