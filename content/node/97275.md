  body: "Yes, but there are different qualities of limits.\r\n\r\nFor example if the
    manifestation of dyslexia does have more than one cause, we would need more than
    one <em>kind</em> of solution. For example if making the bottoms of glyphs heavy
    does help some dyslexics but not all, having 100 bottom-heavy fonts is more limiting
    than having a few bottom-heavy fonts and then some other fonts that help other
    flavors of dyslexics.\r\n\r\nAnd the only way to identify the cause(s) is through
    research.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    there was more than one font for everyone else, (though less than one per person).
    \r\n\r\nDo you want to visit the studies of dyslexics that have shown when something
    is done to type as it's used by normal readers, suspected improvement occurs for
    some dyslexic readers? Or... do you want to visit the studies of normal readers
    that have shown when something is done to type, variance occurs from the norm
    for dyslexic readers? \r\n"

    fact that most of the \u201Cspecially designed for those with disabilities\u201D
    fonts look like crap to people with any taste at all in typography is a form of
    stigmatization.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a primitive situation, akin to that which used
    to exist in many countries with invalid carriages, as they were then known. Of
    course, those vehicles were well meant and fairly useful, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motability\">Motability</a>
    (in the UK from the late 1970s) is a better idea.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs I understand
    the issue raised by David\u2019s question: Is dyslexia a speci\uFB01c condition,
    a variety of specific conditions, or a pathologization of those on the low end
    of the reading \uFB02uency bell curve? And what are the implications of these
    different categories for type design?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Because \"people with any taste at all in typography\" are probably <em>more</em>
    of a stigmatized minority! They're seen as snobs. And what I suspect actually
    ends up happening is that most people think these freakish fonts are \"cool\",
    and that makes dyslexics feel like they're getting some cool special attention!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    came close, but was missing some essential features.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've found another
    one, this one from Mergenthaler Linotype. Oscar - but it doesn't seem to have
    been digitized. This only has the feature that b and d, p and q are distinctive,
    and not features to address other forms of dyslexia; but it is at least not too
    horribly violent a departure from a conventional typeface."

    \u2026 seen as snobs.</em>\r\n\r\nI \uFB01nd that hard to believe, certainly within
    the font-licensing marketplace and amongst professional designers. And such designers
    must surely resent having to cock up their layouts with clunky fonts, and will
    likely not care too much about the end result, which is indeed stigmatization.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026
    most people think these freakish fonts are \"cool\", and that makes dyslexics
    feel like they're getting some cool special attention!</em>\r\n\r\nThat may be
    true amongst the targeted users, but I\u2019m not so sure that the effect of such
    fonts in use, as seen by normal readers, will seen as cool, because (a) designers
    will be using them in a desultory manner, not creating their best and most stylish
    work, and (b) they\u2019re ugly and geeky (in its original meaning), like the
    \u201Cinvalid carriage\u201D depicted above.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t dyslexic readers
    too see them as ugly, quite apart from their functionality in immersive reading?\r\nOr
    does being dyslexic mean that one has no sense of aesthetics?!\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    have anything against the immersive-reading functionality behind these fonts,
    if indeed, that can be proven to be meaningful, but the lack of polish in their
    drawing so far is detrimental to their use in a broader context. \r\n\r\n"

    to go back and look at already completed studies concerning dyslexia and apply
    their findings then to what is now a much larger number of possible typefaces?\r\nIf
    a study indicated that a certain feature of a font's design seemed to help dyslexics
    somewhat from a possible sample of 500 fonts to choose from, then adding a subset
    of say 1,000,000 fonts which may have that same or similar feature?  The odds
    are more fonts with said feature are available now than there used to be kind
    of logic?"
