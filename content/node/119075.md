  images. It seems that it is sometimes used by VSCO. I was looking for their fillters

  body: I'm generally not a fan of the latest trend of creating "fashion" versions
    of Bodoni or Didot, but I like this typeface. Do check out the designer's website--he
    or she (no bio available) does some interesting work.

    chosen style. Grunge free. Names that will not violate the trademarks of the big
    companies. Good stuff.\r\nDon"
