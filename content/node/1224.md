  body: I would like to suggest that this scoring system overlooks the difficulty
    factor.  I think the points should be based only on the number of guesses made,
    not on the time it takes. That factor is already considered when you award points
    to the first one who names the font correctly, but if three or four tries are
    needed then it seems more points should be awarded, because of the difficulty
    in making the correct identification.  <BR>Otherwise you are favoring  the person
    with the fastest server, or the most time to just sit and wait for new posts.  By
    the time I see the first e-mail that there is a new font posted for ID, there
    are already three posts with it to ID the thing, so of course I would like a system
    that puts a bit less emphasis on speed. <BR>Just my two cents. :-&#41;

    border=0> <BR> <BR>You won&#39;t be able to find a watertight system. This  <BR>whole
    competition business with the Leader Board  <BR>started out as just a big amount
    of silliness that&#39;s  <BR>getting a little bit out of hand. The main purpose  <BR>of
    the Leader Boards is to see how efficient we are,  <BR>and the averages and attribution
    of IDs to persons  <BR>is just raw material that&#39;s not really meant to be  <BR>taken
    very seriously, believe me. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
