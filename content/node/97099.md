  body: The stem of the upper case 'i' in FF Meta Hairline is 10 em (is that the correct
    usage?) wide on a 1000 upm grid. I do not imagine that you would want to go much
    below that.

  body: I'm working on an ultralight, and the stem of the capital I is 18 thick. I'm
    not going to make it any thinner ;-)

  body: Luc (de)Groot has done one with 1 unit. I think it is visible at 1 Meter,
    or was it 10?

  body: I think there were curves, but am not exactly sure. I designed my <a href="http://typematters.de/tmt_Ag1.html">Agilita
    Hairline</a> with 4 units which was extremely difficult, especially in the Italics.
    For optical compensation i went down to 3 units. And that was the end of affairs,
    i found. The next weight UltraThin is four times as thick (16) :-)
