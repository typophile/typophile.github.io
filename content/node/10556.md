  body: It may be unrealistic to expect embroidery to match a font, but this reminds
    me most of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/casablanca/urw-t-medium/testdrive.html?s=KENA&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Casablanca</a>. It&#39;s not identical, but I can&#39;t think
    of anything closer at the moment.
