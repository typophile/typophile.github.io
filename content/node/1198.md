  body: I think it looks like &#34;Raphael&#34; that&#39;s been compressed a bit.

  body: Interesting, I had never noticed the similarities between  <BR>ITC Tiffany
    and Raphael. Good catch BTW Mike! <BR> <BR>Do you think Ed Benguiat was inspired
    by the serif treatment <BR>on this one when he designed ITC Tiffany? I don&#39;t
    know of  <BR>any other typefaces that have those protruding bits.
