  a book for, so, this cliente decided he wanted to use helvetica in the entire book
  (wich is a bit crazy but there is nothing i can do to change his mind), as the book
  was inicialy inteded for a non commercial use i had no problem making the book,
  but then he just kinda slipped the news that the book was gonna be sold in the US....
  so now am a bit worried that using this helevtica font (wich i got somewhere aroun,
  i didnt buy it)may be ilegal.\r\n\r\ni know all about tracing the typeface and making
  my won font option being \"legal\", but thats definatelly nooot an option for me
  right now....\r\n\r\nso yeah.. whats my situation?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for
  your help!"

    or [[http://www.linotype.com/1266/NeueHelvetica-family.html|Neue Helvetica]] as
    required. Better yet, you could license the digital revival of [[http://www.linotype.com/en/808330/NeueHaasGrotesk-family.html|Neue
    Haas Grotesk]]!\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that a standard license will only cover
    you for traditional print publication and not any kind of commercial digital distribution
    that requires embedding of the font data. However, some digital platforms have
    versions (certain weights/styles) of Helvetica available as system fonts that
    can be used in those scenarios. Outlining is another option to consider.\r\n\r\nYou
    may also find the discussion of Helvetica in this [[Helvetica and Deja vu book
    pairing for web... is it a crime?|thread]] of interest."

  body: "ok thatks alot for you answers i really a preciate it, eaven though i allready
    new that was gonna be the answer, so here are some more specific questions:\r\n\r\n1.
    one of the problems am having now is that my client wants to modify the \"A\"
    in helvetica font, and eaven if i try getting a helvetica clone i know its gonna
    be impossible to find one with the modified \"A\" as he requires; basically he
    wants the hummmm... \"A\" that you can find in century gothic thats like just
    the cricle and a stick (can really remeber what its called,) so hes on my back
    about this and i cant seem to find a solution, i dont really wanna have to go
    trough all the problem of printing/scanning/tracing/kerneling... etc etc etc.\r\n\r\n2.
    gray areas.... i know its not etically or morally corect but.. it there any way
    i can modify the helvetica font without having to purchase it or make my own?\r\n\r\nam
    really limited here and in a hurry cuz this project gotta be finished by november
    so any help is really apreciated... lika say..... someone owns a clone helvetica
    they wanna let me modify?? hahahah \r\n"
