  goes:\r\nA client of mine would like to send a compliments card with \"met vriendelijke

  me translate \"With kind regards\" in\r\nFrench\r\nGerman\r\nSwedish\r\nNorwegian\r\nFinnish\r\nDanish\r\nSpanish\r\nPortuguese\r\nItalian\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "German: \"mit freundlichen Gr\xFC\xDFen\".\r\nAFAIK, Danish: \"med venlig
    hilsen\".\r\n\r\nBTW, this is such a common phrase that you'll find it translated
    on the web a lot, as well as similar requests on other fora. For instance, this
    (German) <a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/\">translation site</a>, which I usually
    use, has translations for <a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/itde?lang=de&lp=itde&search=mit%20freundlichen%20gr%FCssen\">Italian</a>
    and <a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/esde?lang=de&lp=esde&search=mit%20freundlichen%20gr%FCssen\">Spanish</a>
    too."

  body: "Norwegian: \r\n\r\n\"Med vennlig hilsen\" and its abbrevation, \"Mvh\", is
    widely used, but wrong according to Norsk Spr\xE5kr\xE5d. The correct way to put
    it would be \"Vennlig hilsen\" or \"Med hilsen\" in Norwegian, and \"Vennleg hilsen\"
    or \"Med helsning\" in New Norwegian. Other forms include \"Beste hilsener\" (N)
    and \"Beste helsing\" (NN).\r\n"
