body: I have a sign shop where I do vinyl graphics and signs.  I need to create this
  logo for their vehicles and the typeset is so varied and crooked so I was hoping
  to find out the font and retype the words to make it more crisp. Thanks for you
  help.

    of the logo available? I did find that all the pdf's available on their website
    use a raster version, though.\r\n  - Herb"
