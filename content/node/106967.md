    This is an example picture of the Brauer Neue typeface\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brauer_6462.gif]"

    your simple origin?

    corners are just sightly rounded. Maybe that's why it's a tricky one to identify\r\n"

  body: Damn... Looks like 2 coffees were not enough... Sorry for the misunderstanding.
    My question was referring to your original sample, not Brauer's. Where does this
    "Writing Workshop" lettering come from? Website? PDF?

  body: Oh, I thought you meant the second sample because I've already mentioned where
    the first was from. The original sample comes from a pdf. Will another sample
    make it easier to identify or do you think it was a custom typeface? Thanks

  body: "I'm confused... I hadn't even properly read your first post... Seen only
    now you mentioned a PDF... More coffee would be definitely helpless, I really
    need to rest :D \r\nSo, if you have the original PDF, the answer might be as quick
    as checking what fonts are used on the document: Open Document with Adobe Reader
    > File > Properties > Fonts tab\r\nIf, please post the answer, I'm also interested
    in knowing it. If not, may be a bespoke typeface so the origin of this PDF might
    be helpful (at least more than 2 more coffee's).\r\n\r\nEDIT: What R. said"

  body: "Yes, you should try the font check on the PDF recommended by Ryuk.\r\nIf
    you are lucky you will get a list of fonts, or font subsets used in the PDF.\r\nIf
    you get a blank or just a list of common fonts that you know do not match your
    image, this means that it is not used as a font in the PDF. The PDF might use
    vector outlines, which you can examine in detail if you use a program like Adobe
    Illustrator, or images such as jpegs. You can determine if your PDF uses images
    by increasing the scale. If the quality becomes fuzzy, it uses images. If you
    can scale without loss of quality, the PDF uses fonts or vector outlines.\r\nIf
    this is too technical we can try another approach:\r\n......Is the PDF on the
    web? and\r\n......Do you have a URL that you can post?\r\nDon"

    without bothering you. It says that the typeface is called Sheffield and was created
