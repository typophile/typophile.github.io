  body: Chris, <BR> <BR>I am liable to getting flamed. <BR> <BR>We are not supposed
    to advertise here. I am answering a direct question. You did not say you were
    looking to &#34;buy&#34; anything. So I feel comfortable in offering some help.
    <BR> <BR>The Lanston Type Company is &#34;the&#34; premium, traditional supplier
    of digital fonts. In fact we do little else. We have added several new faces notably
    those by Jim Rimmer, Vancouver, BC and Dave Farey of London. Jim Rimmer still
    cuts types in metal and casts types for printing books. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/JimRimmer.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/JimRimmer.html</a> <BR> <BR>We ceased
    cutting type faces on the Benton Pantograph <a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/BentonPantograph.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/BentonPantograph.html</a> <BR> <BR>And
    making matrices <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/DieCase.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/DieCase.html</a>
    <BR> <BR> <BR>For the machines shown in the &#34;links&#34; below on June 21st,
    MM. A tidal wave destroyed the hot metal department my vehicle, home and warehouse.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/MonotypeKeyboardHands.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/MonotypeKeyboardHands.html</a>
    <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/LanstonCaster.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/LanstonCaster.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>But we continue to offer digital fonts. We are closest to source for
    &#34;Goudy Faces&#34;. Frederic Goudy <BR>type directed the library for 29 years
    of his life. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/GoudyWoodcut.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/GoudyWoodcut.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Our catalogue is getting revamped but you will find that we have included
    historical information on our typefaces and will add more as time permits. <BR><a
    href="http://www.lanstontype.com/CaslonFountEight.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/CaslonFountEight.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>And here is the direct link to the catalogue. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/LanstonPriceList.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/LanstonPriceList.html</a> <BR> <BR>But
    you will find that our site is &#34;huge&#34; informative, I love this word, &#34;nostalgic&#34;
    <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/TypeStick.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/TypeStick.html</a>.
    <BR> <BR>If you are looking for information on a specific typeface you will find
    the same problem as all of us. Sometimes things are found on the web, at others,
    most others, you have to find them in books. <BR> <BR>I hope you will accidentally
    find something in our site that will be helpful to your project. It is hard to
    be more helpful not knowing the specific historical typefaces, or the information
    you are looking for. <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>Lanston Type Company <BR><a

  body: I&#39;m down here in Belgium, but I&#39;m planning to going to  <BR>the next
    ATypI that&#39;s held somewhere in Europe. <BR> <BR>BTW I was/am a great admirer
    of the digital Lanston Types <BR>when they first appeared on the market back when
    I was  <BR>working for FontShop BeNeLux. What a contrast with the  <BR>run-off-the-mill
    stuff we had from Adobe and Agfa in those  <BR>days.

    Now we don&#39;t here from the individual shops like we used to. <BR> <BR>Are

    I live in Belgium, or because I get to meet  <BR>you? &#40;Is there an emoticon

    <BR><i>&#62; FontShop BeNeLux, what are they up to these days?</i> <BR> <BR>We&#39;re
    not really on speaking terms, but I guess business  <BR>as usual. Unfortunately
    they replaced the very interesting  <BR>&#39;Druk&#39; publication by the rather
    bland 96. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; Are you designing type?</i> <BR> <BR>I fear I have
    a paralyzing lack of self-confidence, and <BR>there&#39;s so many talented guys
    out there that I really  <BR>wonder what I could add. Furthermore I&#39;m afraid
    I can&#39;t  <BR>free up sufficient time having a family and being in a  <BR>rock
    band and all that kinda stuff. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a happy user. I
    just wish my type purchasing  <BR>budget would be bigger.
