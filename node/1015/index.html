It's the first Latin sans I've attempted that's not a heavily geometric construction, so any input would be great. I was trying to throw some slight corners into certain characters (o, e, c, etc.) to open up the counters a bit. And have been playing with small flares and tapers on various letters. Not sure if either one is working to anyone's great satisfcation. &quot;vent&quot; is just a detail - and Ardbeg is just a whisky - the face is nameless as of yet.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. This has a really nice feel &ndash; sort of a mix of a humanist sans and an expressionist form like Pressig, Manuscript or Journal. <BR> <BR>The lc &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;x&quot; seem a bit heavy. I'd try maybe making them a bit more modulated, with a bit more contrast between thick and thin strokes rather than the more monolinear approach that you have going now. Perhaps this should apply to the lc &quot;k&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; as well. <BR> <BR>I like the ever-so-slightly wide lc &quot;z&quot;, too.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestions fellas. I wouldn't've thought to add some contrast to &quot;v&quot; et al, but I think it's working well. I still need to shave some weight from the &quot;x&quot;, but otherwise they're fitting in much better as far as color goes.  <BR> <BR>And I shortened the descenders a bit (thanks for pointing that out, Eduardo) - I hadn't even noticed how incredibly long they were. The &quot;g&quot; still needs a lot of work. When I shortened the descenders, I redrew it with the Beziers to bring it in line, but I think I really need to rework it on paper. It seems too light and perhaps too narrow all the sudden.  <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, I also fiddled some more with the terminal flares and notches at som eof the joints. I moved the top notch on &quot;p&quot; because the top joint is already tapered - it seemed more logical to trim the bottom joint. And I took a nibble out of the shoulders of &quot;m&quot;. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, the cyan is the first version, the black is the revision. I guess that's obvious. If you're interested, I posted some of my sketches <a href="http://eightyproof.com/nhsketch.htm" target=_top> here</a> - unfortunately my brother's architectural drafting skills didn't run my way in the family&hellip; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14818.gif" alt=""></div>

The lc 'g' and 'a' are, as one of the old masters pointed out, the letters where the evidence of the pen is most evident and hard to eliminate in the alphabet.  <BR> <BR>I am thinking that you might look to your Ardbeg a, particularly the tail of it for a better way to connect the loop of your 'g' to the top.

		<div class="commentbody">Seeing your text setting, I am excited that this promises to be a very readable sans even in text. It is narrow but very open because of the angular counters. You might compare Vesta, the new face of Gerard Unger at <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.gerardunger.com">www.gerardunger.com</a></a>. It is one of the most readable sans I have seen, and your face promises to accomplish the same thing in a different way. He has rounded counters, and a narrow, humanist structure. He gets the openness partly by very narrow joins between round and straight strokes - a general feature of his designs.  <BR> <BR>You are approaching this in a different way, which gives a wonderful liveliness as well as good 'color'. <BR> <BR>I like your new 7 and y. I don't know whether the f is an improvement; I would like to see more text setting.  <BR> <BR>The g I think still doesn't work; it looks odd and sticks out, to my eyes. Is the problem that the link between the loop and the top of the g sticks out too far to the left? That the link should narrow more in the joining to the top? Or maybe that the bottom of the loop should be lightened, following the stress in serif fonts? Unger does all of these in Vesta. You have a very different look, but maybe there is a way to make the g more harmonious adapting these patterns to your deisgn.</div>

But I recently got off my fat arse, and started working on a range of weights.  <BR> <BR>The PDF is the &quot;first pass&quot; I guess you could call it. The lightest, heaviest, and middle weight are all drawn - the intermediate weights are generated from Multiple Master instances.

E.g., are the jumps between the heavier weights too big, the hevaiest weight just too heavy, etc.  <BR> <BR>I'm not sure about the amount of contrast that shows up in the heavier weights, but I don't know a way to get aorund that.

That said, you can probably get by with quite a bit less contrast than you have because of your forms. <BR> <BR>One final note: check the ascender height on your f.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, here are my thoughts on spacing sans serifs. They come only from experience of looking, not designing.  <BR> <BR>Spacing between letters, according to Walter Tracy and others should relate to the space in the counters of the letters, as well as varying with external letter shape. I think the thickness of the stems is also a factor.  <BR> <BR>The challenge with san serifs is that absent serifs the spacing looks wide, tending to break up the words. So sans often more closely spaced than serif faces. But this close spacing can hurt readability, IMHO. Here Helvetical/Arial is a prime offender. When you have very circular letters, as opposed to narrower ovals then balancing the spacing with the counters can get ridiculously wide. But putting them very close hurts readibility, as the shapes of the letters become lost in the crush. If you look at a text setting of Meta, which is narrower and has more space in relation to the counters, it is much more readable than Helvetica.  <BR> <BR>I tend to think that Hrant is just mistaken about the greater importance of the external outline of the word, the 'Bouma' as he calls it, compared to the discernment of the shapes of the individual letters. I think that both are important. Thus wider spacing, to a point, helps, not hurts readibility. <BR> <BR>Another factor here is x-height. Another reason Futura is more readable than Helvetica, in spite of its circular letters, is that the smaller x height allows the space between letters to be looser and hence both more balanced and legible in relation to the spaces in the counters. And, yes, taller extenders also help on differentiating more the external outline of the words. <BR> <BR>With all these ruminations in mind, my reaction your spacing is that in the more black text setting the spacing is OK, but it is too loose in the case of the lightest weight.  <BR> <BR>In the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the letter forms. If I am not mistaken (I don't have the font) I believe that is what Gerard Unger does with his Vesta. That way when you narrow the spacing - which the narrow stems also seem to call for - you still have balance between the inter-letter space and the internal counters. <BR> <BR>As I said earlier in this thread, I am really struck by how readable Vesta is as a sans. Unger has written a book about is views, and I am looking forward to the English edition, which I believe his site says he is working on.  <BR> <BR>As Randy said, and as I noted earlier when you posted a smaller text setting, it is striking how readable Ardbeg is in smaller text settings. I think you have going for you not only the narrower shapes and the open counters that the angularity gives you (a la Dwiggens), but also a more generous x-height than Vesta.  <BR> <BR>All of this promises to have you end up with an exceptionally readable sans, which I think is great. I think playing with the letter widths as well as spacing with the different weights, as Vesta seems to do, may help you get to this goal. <BR> <BR>On the differences in the weights, Unger likes the relatively small differences between different weights, I guess based on the idea that what pairing of weights a designer would want would depend on the design and the paper. James Montalbano also gave a very interesting rationale <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14103.html?1060892227#POST25607" target="_blank">here</a>. <BR> <BR>  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>   <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for all the feedback. I'm implementing the suggestions, and I should have a new sample in the next day or so. The contrast is being dropped substantially out of the heavy master, and I'll re-interpolate the other heavy weights based on that. <BR> <BR>&gt;James Montalbano also gave a very interesting rationale  <BR> <BR>I had forgotten about that post. Thanks for the reminder, William. Based on that, I'm wondering if there should be 3 steps between the regular (fourth row in the PDF above) and the heaviest weight. As opposed to 2. That would allow a Medium weight to function per James analysis. As the weights stand, I can't see them working as a regular + bold and medium + bold. <BR> <BR>&gt;according to Walter Tracy and others  <BR> <BR>I actually just picked up a copy of L.O.C. when I was at the Newberry Library last week. I had forgotten that it was in print again. I have yet to apply his scheme (is it the same as Briem's?) to Ardbeg however. That's this weekend's labor. <BR> <BR>As far as the spacing goes right now, I've set the spacing for the regular weight - obviously it is in want of some tweaking. The lighter weights are optical spaced (a la InDesign) and tracked tighter - though not tightly enough. I haven't even begun to touch them for real. And the heavy weights have just some rudimentary side bearings set. Clumsy and horribly un-craftsman-like I know. <BR> <BR>That said, I shall attempt to tweak the letterfit of all the weights this weekend, concentrating on tightening the fit of the light weights. <BR> <BR>&gt;it allows you to make great quasi-fake smallcaps.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps I'll use this as my next test for weight distribution&hellip; <BR> <BR>&gt;In the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the letter forms.  <BR> <BR>I may yet give this a try. In my head I was thinking that it would be best to err on the side of wider characters. To keep the counters open and such. Perhaps I have been on the wrong track.  <BR> <BR>I'm afraid this post is mostly me talking to myself and organizing my game-plan. I apologize for the useless prolixity.</div>

Here goes: A larger x-height means a smaller ascender/descender height, means a larger looking face compared to others of the same point size, requiring more spacing at the same optical size&hellip; Meanwhile, the shorter ascenders/ascenders gain you vertical space by decreasing the needed leading, which in shorter lines of copy controls the space economy much more than the width of a typeface or looseness of spacing. So you can easily afford a bit more width. As for examples I will leave that up to him! *breath* Monarchy fovea bouma notan.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;If I am not mistaken  <BR> <BR>Ok, I have checked Unger's PDF and I was mistaken. He doesn't narrow the counters of the lighter letters. The counter of his heaviest weight is 44% smaller than the lightest. Also your n is actually narrower than his, if I am comparing like weights correctly. However, because of Ardbeg's squared-off structure Eric Olsen may be right (or not!) that your normal weight hmnu could benefit by being slightly narrower. I guess one issue to check is the relationship between the counters in the pbod and hmnu, which should balance.  <BR> <BR>It looks to me like Unger's seven weights run the range between your five middle weights. He says this is deliberate because he doesn't think the lightest and heaviest weights are much used. I like your heaviest weight a lot. Your lightest works the least well to my eyes.  <BR> <BR>By the way, I agree with Randy about bringing down the height of the f slightly. (The present form works better in the fat weights than the thin weights.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; [large x height allows wider letter spacing] <BR> <BR>Randy's [second-hand] logic probably comes to the same thing, but it's really much simpler: a smaller x-height [generally] means smaller counters. Look at it &quot;absolutely&quot;: simply when you set a given font smaller (= smaller x-height) the space between the letters gets smaller too. (But more than &quot;allows&quot; it's &quot;needs&quot;.) <BR> <BR>Futura has wider spacing than Helvetica because it's designed better. <BR> <BR>Leading/x-height: <BR>Randy and Nathan are both right! A larger x-height normalized to the same apparent size needs less absolute leading, but at the same point size it needs more relative leading. <BR> <BR>&gt; It's really pretty amazing. <BR> <BR>BTW, I've measured it. Its behavior is &quot;bilinear&quot;: a line from 4 point to 12; a more shallow line from 12 to 72; and flat below 4 and above 72.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Futura has wider spacing than Helvetica because it's designed better. <BR> <BR>Ok, I can buy that Futura is better designed.  <BR>However, I think there is more going on here. When I track Helvetica progressively wider, and the same with Futura, the words of Helvetica seem to fall apart and the whole look too loose long before Futura falls apart.  <BR> <BR>I think the longer extenders hold together the 'Boumas' (ack! did I say that?) better, so the smaller x-height sans can take looser spacing. In other words, I think the Helvetical designer did the spacing he did for a good reason, even though it messes up the readability at small sizes.   <BR>  <BR>&gt;a larger looking face compared to others of the same point size, requiring more spacing at the same optical size. <BR> <BR>Well, Tracy says that the spacing should match the counters, which don't change with varying the extenders. But he didn't discuss sans serifs. If you look at digital Gill sans, and type iio, the space between the ii is much smaller than the counter of the o, whereas in say Times it is very similar. Now I think I read that Gill in metal was spaced much wider, but again I think the digital adjustments were in response to a problem that the spacing looked too loose in the metal.  <BR> <BR>Ok, the following is just a pet theory of mine, but there may be something in it. My theory is that without serifs you not only have problems visually finding the line of text, but also the spacing problems become substantial. Space a sans like a serif, and the words fall apart. Space it closely, and the legibility and hence readibility decreases in small (text) sizes. Hence sans are usually harder to read in text sizes. Large, the tight spacing is not a problem, as the absolute space between letters is big enough that legibility is not hurt.  <BR> <BR>I think the x-height and weight of the stem also affect how spacing works, especially with a sans. Also with narrower designs, the problems aren't so severe. I don't know what Unger has figured out about all this, but from the PDF of his Vesta, which mixes sans and serifs impressively, he has some new insights.  <BR> <BR>So even two Hrants (shudder <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>) don't convince me.  <BR> <BR>&gt;Monarchy fovea bouma notan <BR>Democracy, iris, letter, notan (ok, I like notan). <BR> <BR>The relevance to Nathan's spacing challenges in different weights is this the following. I don't have a clear theory of how to space a sans. But my point is that there is more in spacing a sans than is usually realized, and that therefore it is worth experimenting with both letter width and spacing, rather than just one or the other, if you have a goal of readability in text for your sans. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

This one has an added heavy weight which I'm hoping will make the regular/bold, medium/black combinations work better. As well as diminshing the difference between regular and medium. Unfortunately I don't have the heavy cpitals drawn, so I didn't include any tests for small caps like Hrant mentioned. <BR> <BR>The heavier l/c g's are awful.

I suspect that mechanical interpolations, while no doubt saving a lot of work, lead to a better result when they are reworked with both aesthetics and the end use in mind.  <BR> <BR>On the mnhu, I just haven't spent the time as you have or have the experience, as some others who post here do, to say much helpful. I just think you should not hesitate to change widths or x heights or degree of modulation or spacing with the different weights if you think that will serve the end result. You do need to stay in touch with your orginal inspiration, the 'chiseled' look on this face from the angular counters. But I suspect the family will be better if it is expressed differently in the different weights.   <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed. Interpolation does save some time initially, but with the re-drawing later on I'm not sure if it doesn't all end up equal in the final analysis. <BR> <BR>But since the weights, for the most part, seem fairly close, I believe the time to tweak the crude mechanical output is nigh. <BR> <BR>Some interesting ideas in your last post that I'll have to play with this weekend. Perhaps the 2 heaviest weights I've drawn can serve as 2 seperate masters for the intermediate heavies. Or something like that. Blah blah blah. Thanks once more for your insights.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At the risk of waking a sleeping dog, I thought I'd post again to this thread. I've been fooling around with the italics for this face [finally] and I'm at a point where I could certainly use some input. <BR> <BR>Originally I intended to make the italic companion more 'cursive' that what I've ended up with. The cursive forms just didn't seem to make sense when paired with the roman. So, instead, I've gone (1) lighter, (2) narrower, &amp; (3) slightly looser. Hoping that that's enough to differentiate it from the roman.  <BR> <BR>The slope is somewhat slight : about 5%, though I've taken Hrant's advice to others and used a <i>slope</i> of 1/11. Italic caps have [obviously] less work done on them. Slope is much less at 1/28 (about 2%). Caps are heavier than the lower caseperhaps much too heavyand wider. At this point they're just the roman slanted.  <BR> <BR>Also, the letterfit is tighter than before. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: 040423-34184.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*43.4**040423%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf"><br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/040423-34184.pdf" target="_blank"><b>040423.pdf</b></a> (43.4 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know about the looseness. If you're having trouble making the italics stand out I'd rather see [more] lightness, or maybe a steeper slope (like 1/8, a nice power-of-two invert). You might even make the x-height slightly smaller. <BR> <BR>&gt; &hellip;. a slope of 1/11 <BR> <BR>Cool. <BR>Now you know that for every 11 units you move vertically you need to move 1 unit horizontally, and maintain the exact slope angle. Note that your vertical proportions should ideally be multiples of 11! <BR> <BR>&gt; 1/28 <BR> <BR>That seems a bit low - the slant might disappear at lower resolutions.

		<div class="commentbody">Not really. In fact a decimal base is easier to work with during editing; like 1/10 and 1/20 might be better here. I'm just a binary boy, that's all.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Nathan. <BR> <BR>This is shaping up to be a useful addition. Surprised at how small it sets. Lots of internal leading going on. 11 looks like 9. Looks good, but I might scale everything up 10%. <BR> <BR>Some general comments: <BR>I think the lc italic is working fine. The upper has issues as you mention. It is much too dark. I tend to like caps that match the lc color very closely. To that end even your Roman caps look dark to me. Also, I'd add a touch more slant to the Italic caps (could just be the dark color that's over-emphasizing it) <BR> <BR>Specifics: <BR>W: Not digging the crossing. It makes a huge black spot. Maybe in a titling version, or the light, but here it's too much IMHO. <BR>v,w: Watch for optical illusions in the stress. Looks left heavy. <BR>w: Looks dark. <BR>Q: Thin the tail join <BR>F: Drop the crossbar a hair lower than the E <BR>S,s: Not digging the curves. The spine looks like he broke his back in 2 places. A bit less abrupt, but keeping the corner? <BR>d: Consider reversing the cut angle on the stem for uniformity. <BR>!: Looks dark. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy</div>
