  well those that make up the Linotype Platinum Collection (www.linotype.com/1805/platinumcollection.html),
  and was wondering if I could get your opinions on a few questions that I have to
  ask\u2026\r\n\r\n-\twhat defines a \u2018classic\u2019 face? Is it its age, individuality,
  history etc.\r\n-\tdo you think the faces chosen are a fair selection or have they
  missed a face or even got it wrong?\r\n-\tdo you think they even needed reinventing?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    I think a better way to describe it is that it is a quality collection.\r\n\r\nIn
    my mind 'classic' font's are font's that have proved themselves by standing the
    test of time and probably a good breadth of uses. The ones that jump to mind are
    Helvetica (Linotype), Garamond, Eurostyle, Gill Sans (Monotype), Times New Roman
    (Monotype), Baskerville."

  body: "I actually have a 'classic' set in my library and there is very little overlap
    with Linotype's set.\r\nTheir's is weighted more to the modern/sans than my set,
    which includes Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni, Bembo and Caslon among others.\r\n\r\nFor
    Sans, you have to include Futura and Franklin Gothic I'd think, not to mention
    Helvetica. I hate Frutiger.\r\n\r\nI'd call Linotype's Platinum collection more
    of a 'versatile' collection."

  body: 'This is interesting, because there are a number of the "classic" typefaces
    are not generally well-liked by typographers and designers. Helvetica is a prime
    example. Times is another. So there are typefaces that are widely used, but could
    be improved upon for various reasons - poor digitization when making the transition
    from film or metal to postscript being one. '

  body: My knowledge of typeface design/typography is quite minimal at the moment
    and i'm using this dissertation and an excuse to expand on it.....and the more
    i read on various typefaces and collections, i am seeing very little of the faces
    in the Platinum Collection being refered to as "classics"

  body: "Brilliant, Nick.\r\n\r\nOptima is only a 'classic' because it was one of
    the early digitized fonts and therefore massively overused. It SO does not merit
    classic status in my book. And certainly fonts that are bundled in every computer
    (Times, Palatino) do not necessarily merit 'classic' status. If that's your standard,
    why not include Arial? Or Comic Sans?\r\n\r\nTo me, a classic is a font that has
    stood the test of time. Fonts like Bembo and Garamond have been around for centuries
    and can still look fresh."

  body: "The British historian and critic James Secord made this observation about
    literary classics\r\n\r\n<em>'Those books that allow us to forget the most are
    accorded the status of a classic.'</em>\r\n\r\nAnd I think this is applicable
    to type design in many respects too. A classic typeface is one that dominates
    an idiom or genre, such that any other typefaces in that idiom are automatically
    compared to it. A classic typeface also becomes a kind of filter through which
    we view typographic history. So, for example, we have come to view Venetian typography
    through the filter of Bembo. And here is where Secord's observation applies, because
    the filter makes us forgetful and we ignore large amounts of actual Venetian typography."

  body: "But who are the \"We\" who become forgetful?\r\n\r\nThere are media involved,
    most obviously when a classic has not been in continuous use.\r\nThen it is the
    cultural arbiters such as Updike, Meggs, Heller and Bringhurst, and the commercial
    influences such as Linotype, who have some say in the matter.\r\n\r\nThis is driven
    home by Charles Murray in his statistical analysis of \"Human Accomplishment\",
    where he correlates achievement with mention in published reference works.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if a particularly talented redesigner, or one who works for a dominant font distributor,
    goes to work on reviving a face, it stands a much better chance of becoming a
    classic."

  body: "Classic does not mean beloved by all. You must also consider some visions
    of classic are marketing attempts. A true classic defines a model.  As John Hudson
    points out, the one you compare the others of its kind to. The older a type is,
    the less argument about its status as a classic.  Nobody argues Garamond but there
    is more angst about Helvetica. To me AG is the classic European grot but Helvetica
    rained in many peoples faces since 1957.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Classic is everything that is exemplifying, and therefore outstanding, forming
    a canon of models to be emulated. Applied to typefaces, this means that 'classic'
    are those that are/were used by classic typographers \u2014 which only postpones
    the question. Nevertheless, I guess, there is a quite greater consensus to be
    found on its answer."

  body: "Hey,\r\nOptima is a classic font. It really was the first humanist sans.
    It is often copied, poorly used and applied to the lowest rung of the typographical
    ladder. That said though, when used properly it still looks beautiful. It started
    on fire, has been through metal, film, phototypesetting and now digital. If a
    font is continually in use, perhaps not always at the zenith of popularity, but
    used enough through several generations, it becomes a classic. Some fonts are
    found again and become popular again. I think it is easier to figure Oldstyle
    and transitional fonts being classic compared to most sans, as time appropriates
    the classic line.\r\nPlantin is a classic while almost every font from film-O-type
    is not. Why? who uses the fonts from film-O-type (Skokie, Ill)? I did, but it
    has been 20 years. Photolettering fonts (which I thought were great) are pretty
    much not in any use (except House did revivalof sorts), of 12,000 font library.
    Gone. Poof. au revior. \r\nI guess just as important as to what is a classic is
    what is not.  \r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you free"
