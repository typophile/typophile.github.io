  which i have seen at the beginning of a youtube video. I have attached a screenshot,
  the video itself is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kDWPfEpMyU\r\nThe font
  whereof  i'd like very much to know its name is seen from 00:02 until 00.05.\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much in advance for your help. I have looked through a lot of font catalogues
  in the last few days but couldn't find it.\r\nJakob\r\nPS: i have already written
  to the user who created the video but didn't get a response.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5782.jpg]"

  body: thank you very much for your suggestion! i don't think you are right, though.
    Stoclet has a totally different much less playful character.

  body: "Yes, Stoclet it's not the same font, capital /D seems to be flipped and many
    other characters like capital /O, /Y and the zero digit are quite different or
    modified.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the two fonts share some rather unusual design
    patterns on glyphs /A, /G, /P, /H and that's why I said your sample could be a
    modified version of Stoclet or maybe both fonts are based on the same pre-digital
    era font.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there is a font matching perfectly  to your sample,
    but I personally can't find one...\r\nLet's wait and see if somebody else knows
    more about your font ;)"

  body: "thank you very much! maybe more characters make it easier for someone to
    identify it.\r\n@fvilanakis. i like/support your idea that both, stoclet and \"my\"
    font are based on the same pre-digital font. But i doubt that my font is any modified
    existing font. why should the user who created this video have made the effort
    of changing a font so much, just for adding subtitles to a piece of music? I strongly
    believe that he used an existing one, whose name we didn't find out yet.\r\n\r\ndoes
    anybody have an idea? :)"

    based on the same source as\u2014or something similar to\u2014Stoclet ITC.  You
    might want to check a large free font repository like dafont.com and look at their
    Art Nouveau offerings."

  body: "I certainly agree with you that the titles were made from an existing font
    and were not bespoke.\r\n\r\nThere is a plethora of Arts & Crafts style fonts
    such as this one. It seems a new one pops up every couple of days! I have an extensive
    accumulation of them, but without a match to this.  Nick Curtis has produced quite
    a few, as have others. I just happened upon a new one today (Elega by Neal Fletcher).
    Some, like your sample, have high crossbars, some low, some mixed, some double.
    Some have curved stems, some have crossbars that cross the stem. There's a continuum
    of varieties that approach the Plaza and Andes typeface families, and may be described
    as anything from Art Nouveau to Art Deco and more.\r\nFor some examples, google
    images for \"Arts and Crafts\" fonts (WITH the quotes)\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking,
    and hope that others do to.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "thank you! during my studies i have dealt a lot with Vienna around 1900 and
    spent some time learning about art deco and art nouveau, but didn't come across
    the arts and crafts movement, which seems to be an english movement only. \r\nThe
    fonts that show up are indeed quite close matches to the one i have posted, so
    i now know quite well where i have to keep my eyes open! As you i couldn't find
    a perfect match yet.\r\n\r\nthanks again!"
