body: "I am working on transforming my resume so that it is fit for graphic design
  positions. Thus far I have used my resume for part time, clerical, customer service
  jobs. \r\n\r\nAnd now I feel inadequate... ha. \r\n\r\nI'm only applying for an
  internship, and it is unpaid, so I feel like what my resume lacks, I should be able
  to make up in the fact that I am applying and that seemingly no one else has in
  the past 3 months. The position has been listed a few times on the company's site
  of choice. \r\n\r\nSo if anyone has any suggestions or tips, they're most welcome.
  I think I've gotten my content solidified. Now comes the fun part of putting it
  together in InDesign. \r\n"

  body: "I recently went through and re-designed my resume to suit a more graphically
    minded audience as well. I'll try and help you as best I can. This is free advice
    though too, and I don't know how much you already know about resumes so take each
    point with a grain of rice. (I know I know, it's salt but rice rhymed.)\r\n\r\n-If
    you don't already know what sort of design direction you want to take it in, do
    some looking at magazines or websites that you like the look of. Take note of
    graphical elements you can use in your resume like header, bullet and font styles.
    Make sure you don't go overboard on the designing, however. Remember it primarily
    needs to be functional and understandable.\r\n\r\n-If you're applying to schools
    or jobs in a specific field, take that into account in your designs. Make sure
    your resume matches the look and feel a given type of company or college would
    want.\r\n\r\n-Remember: the primary goal of a resume is to get you an interview.
    Make sure that someone flipping through stacks of resumes would flag yours to
    make a call.\r\n\r\n-General advice about getting where you want to be in a company
    that can also be applied here: \"Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.\"
    Maybe a bit cliche, but helps just the same. Design your resume with your desired
    job in mind. Don't design it as if you were an intern, but as if you were an art
    director for a major design firm.\r\n\r\nI don't know if any of those points are
    helpful . . . or if they sounded any different from a self help book on writing
    resumes. Best of luck in getting that internship."

  body: "pennANDink - comments helpful! I created my resume in InDesign. It's pretty
    simple, but I don't have Word on my laptop because usually other things suffice,
    although I am planning on borrowing my boyfriend's copy for other endeavors.\r\n\r\nBut
    the resume is pretty simple. I wondered if I might be going overboard by using
    InDesign but I feel a bit justified after those comments. \r\n\r\n\r\naluminum
    - I would be, too."
