<p>What can we do about it? Reporting each single entry is probably not the best solution. I can&rsquo;t even ignore these spam posts because they always show up in the Track function and AFAIK I cannot even unsubscribe my own entries, can I?
If the admins don&rsquo;t spot these spammers, I guess the best option would be to give the blog users the option to delete replies in threads they have started.</p>

<p>Both Florian and I try to police most sections of the site daily.</p>
<p>I check the General Forums and Design daily. Florian usually watches Type ID. And one of us usually catches Build activity before too long. I regularly check the main Blog section, but since the list doesn’t re-order based on comments, only original posting date, I don’t always catch spam comments in older blog posts. For some reason, certain threads become spam magnets.</p>
<p>For a while I was regularly checking the master Comments listing every morning, but I had to stop at one point because I was otherwise too busy and it’s really time-consuming. I will try to resume.</p>
<p>You can always send me an e-mail if a spam comment persists and you think we’ve missed it.</p>
<p>Initial posts are run through the antispam filter, but individual comments currently are not. The engine still puts up too many false positives, which would seriously hamper conversations.</p>
<p>(Ironically, this post was originally flagged and I had to rescue it from the spam queue. <em>sigh</em>)</p>

<p>Since some spammers know how to fool filters, would it be possible to set it up so that a new user&rsquo;s first post must be approved by an administrator before it&rsquo;s posted?</p>

<p>If everyone is willing to be a little patient and just ignore the occasional spam (irritating as it is), usually within 24 hours it gets cleaned up.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize for the occasional lapses when situations like Ralf’s slip through undetected for an extended length of time. For those cases, just let one of us know.</p>

<p>I understand that if you have to manually search for posts by new users, but is there a way to configure the software so it presents you with just a list of first-time posts from new users? (After the spam filter has already done an initial weeding.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking because a friend used to moderate a discussion board and it was configured that way. A couple of times a day she&rsquo;d just review the list of first-time posts from new users that had made it through the spam filter, and it just took her a minute to weed out the remaining spam and approve the rest.</p>
<p>Perhaps the software running this message board doesn&rsquo;t have that feature; I&rsquo;m just asking. I totally understand that manually searching would be too time-consuming.</p>
