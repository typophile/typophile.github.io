    I left the theater yesterday but have been unable to find one. \r\n\r\nI was particularly
    struck by the one of the typefaces that had a very unique R. It was a straight
    leg with what I suppose you could describe as an ink trap where the leg met the
    bowl. It was quite beautiful (even to the point where after the movie I sketched
    it on a receipt as inspiration for a face I am working on)."

  body: He's talking about a different type treatment (or at least I am). The typefaces
    in the movie's opening and closing titles are not the same as the ones on the
    poster. I'll see if I can find a picture tonight.
