body: "Here is a suggestion for the improvement of Acrobat Reader.\r\n\r\nMake a setting
  so that you can choose a cream paper background rather than just standard screen
  white. So that when a document is put on the web it looks more like print on paper.
  Maybe also make that background colour non-printing so that it doesn't look awful
  when output to a b&w laser printer.\r\n\r\nI know one could do something like this
  now, by setting the page colour in the document preparation program like InD or
  Quark or LaTeX. But putting it into Acrobat Reader with a simple switch to turn
  it on or off would make it a lot simpler.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?"

    request</a> page.

  body: "You can already do this in Reader. Go to <strong>Edit > Preferences > Accessibility</strong>.
    Then, under <strong>Document Colors Options</strong>, click the <strong>Replace
    Document Colors</strong> checkbox. Next, click the <strong>Custom Color</strong>
    radio button. Then click the <strong>Page Background:</strong> button and select
    a color from the standard palette, or click <strong>Other Color...</strong> and
    create your own color. The selected color shows up on the screen but doesn't print.
    You can also change the text color if you want to, using the <strong>Document
    Text:</strong> button. These choices are \"sticky\" and apply both to the file
    you have open and to any files you open subsequently.\r\n\r\nThis won't do any
    good on the web, though, because -- nominally -- the webmaster can't control how
    users have their Reader set up. (Actually, I can think of at least one way to
    do it automatically, but imposing that on users doesn't seem ethical to me.)"

  body: "\"What do you guys think?\"\r\n\r\nEven simpler, don't publish PDFs. Publish
    HTML. Then the user can easily look at it ay way they want. (Granted, that doesn't
    help us that need to look at PDFs...)"
