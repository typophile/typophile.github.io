  a lot of other first timers, it was originally based on my handwriting, but has
  since moved away from being a script into a fun looking rounded monoline sans serif,
  while retaining many of the unique forms of my writing.\r\n\r\nSo, take a look and
  I look forward to hearing what you have to say.\r\n\r\nThanks..."

    the skewed C's, the 0 and I don't think that the G works. other than that I like
    it very much."

  body: I think that a heavier weight should be another consideration. For instance
    is you designed this face in 72 point art what happens to the characters at 24
    point?

  body: "I think your dots can stand to be heavier overall (. : ; i j)\r\nA problem
    inherent in monoline fonts is that these dots look much too light when they are
    circles of the same width as the general stroke weight. They need to be enlarged
    slightly and/or made not quite so circular."

  body: "The foot of the majiscule R could be pulled out a little into the bowl (away
    from the stem), which would allow it to be less limp looking.\r\n\r\n(Is Dagenham
    Dave from a Morrissey song?)"

  body: "You have family problems here. Some of your letters are nice and geometric,
    while others are not.\r\n\r\nLetters I'd drastically change would be: C, c, K,
    @, and \u20AC.\r\n\r\nLetters I'd moderately change would be: G (too closed on
    the top or too open on the bottom), M/W (adjust one to another. I don't mean mirror
    them but adjust them to match), S, s (they are too big and too wide on the top
    half), Y (it's heavily falling right), 3 (too big top - adjust it to 8), 5 (ending
    should be more left or move the top left stem more to the right), 7 (unstable
    just as Y), 9 (too narrow).\r\n\r\nNice start."
