  Any thoughts? Is it too similar to something else?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nola_3759.jpg]"

    digging the idea of reinventing Emerson, though this seems more of a display face,
    doesn't it?\r\n"

  body: Yes, this came out of trying to make blackletter shapes much smoother and
    more classical. I definitely want to keep the blackletter influence in there but
    not make it prominent.

  body: "Right. Here it is, I started digitising.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nola-Specimen_6518.gif]\r\nFollowing
    Hrant's suggestion about Emerson, I had a closer look at that typeface and transposed
    the exit strokes. It's turned out with quite a musical/poetic quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's
    quite a lot going on that needs to be resolved so if anyone has helpful suggestions
    (including any similar typefaces I can refer to) that would be great."

    know its in line with the other terminals but maybe it could be removed and have
    a sans terminal like the /c/\r\nhope that helps\r\n\r\nlooks great otherwise,
    love the direction this is going"

  body: Here's some more of the lowercase. I've switched to quadratic (TrueType) splines
    to allow more nuanced curves, and regularised the x-height. Tweaked the head serifs,
    foot serifs all over and remade the finials of a, d, t and u.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nola-sample_5447.gif]

    very slightly curved stems could perhaps make this even better. Hope you'll find
    time to carry on with this.

    Nevertheless it progresses nicely and may become a nice display font.\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried making the lower curve of /e/ narrower so it doesn't extend so far to
    the right? It seems a bit too wide unbalancing the whole glyph."
