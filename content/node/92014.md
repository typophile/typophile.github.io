  Garamond.. but obviously it's not a match. If anyone could ID this typeface that
  would be pretty awesome.\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "I think it was based on a font whose name begins with letter \u2018A\u2019.
    They used an alternate \u2018H\u2019 and modified \u2018k\u2019.\r\nHowever, the
    font is a knock-off of Adobe Caslon. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve not shown the name
    of the font. You could find the knock-off on Dafont or somewhere else."
