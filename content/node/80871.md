body: "Hello typophiles! :D I'm setting up a project in my very first typography course.
  It's also the first one where we really learn about the elements of design like
  repetition and contrast and such. Oh, and also about Gestalt! But yes, I'd just
  like some general feedback on the font choice and the layout and such. I'd very
  much appreciate it! I, of course, still have a lot to learn. So it'd be great to
  hear from all you experts, that way I can be more knowledgeable. I've been looking
  into the books in the resource section, and definitely intend on reading into them.
  Right now I'm reading the Universal Principles of Design, and it's great. \r\n\r\nOkay,
  so I have a slight issue with rambling. This will be my last sentence. Alright,
  maybe just one more.\r\n\r\nLinky:\r\n\r\nhttp://pdfcast.org/pdf/document-4"
