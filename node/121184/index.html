So its kind of a school which combine play + learn for kids.
The concept is "building blocks".

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/name card_5290.PNG]

So this is a folded name card.
I think the back part of the name card is a bit too complicated but I have no idea on what to do.
Anyone could give me any advise? I really need helps here
Comments and critiques are highly welcomed :)

Thanks.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">What's the purpose of having it fold? You end up with 4 panels instead of 2, and some of the info is hidden when the card is folded.

Most business cards have all the vital info on one side, but yours has important info on both sides, which could be a problem if the card is attached to something (hung on a refrigerator, taped to a card in a Rolodex, etc).

You might consider deleting "http://"  in several places. Printed URLs are usually shortened these days (apple.com, amazon.com, etc).

		<div class="commentbody">I like the idea of the folding (and cut) card, because it plays well with the overall theme, but agree with James about the inconsistency of the 3D letters in black&white (and about removing http, etc.).
It’s not clear how the card would look when it’s folded, and I think you could play more with it, maybe making the inside area coloured, so that the card will look mostly white when folded, then a big brightly coloured square would appear when it’s opened.
To clear things up, other than what James already suggested, I think you should get rid of the “build” in 3D (the coloured squares at the bottom already give the same message), then place the four slogans more loosely, and without the grey squares (instead, you could make them play with the coloured ones).
Also, you don’t need to repeat the logo (especially because, when small, the “Play-Skool” become unreadable). 
Speaking of the logo, I’m not sure why “Play-S” is in bold and “kool” isn’t, and the orange and red squares could be seen as flying away from the “P” rather than building it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really appreciate your comments. So I have made some adjustments on it. Kindly have a look at this.

So this is the front part of name card. When the card is being opened, you can see the whole yellow square. For the repeated logo on this square, I put it there because no one will know what this name card is about when it's being cut. So I think it's necessary. Or maybe you have other suggestions for this logo part?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/front_4321.PNG]

The back of name card. So yea, I had the 3D letters of "build" removed, it's not consistent with the theme. Also, I have change the grey squares to color squares, and another option, in flaticon with outlines only. But still, I think the blocks at the bottom is a bit too messy or it somehow didn't looks consistent from the front of name card. Any suggestions for the arrangement of the blocks?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/back_3532.PNG]

And you mentioned how the card would look when it’s folded. So this is how it looks.

Thank you so much for the feedback. It really helps me alot.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For the back, you could try to reference the structure of the logo: using the "falling" coloured squares as bullet points for the slogans.
I didn't realised that the idea was to cut off the square part of the card. Anyway, one thing you could do in order to make the small logo more legible is to move the wordmark "Play-Skool" to the right, above "building blocks".
I see a couple of problems with the folded card. The first is that there's no way it will look like your picture:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PS_5341.png]
The second one is that the contact icons' squares bear no visual relation with the yellow cut-out square. Again you could reprise the logo arrangment, or find some other alignment.
Last, but not least important: on the folded card the logo isn't visible anywhere, while I would expect it to be the most prominent element.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Whoa, you reminded me that the logo is the the most prominent element. Why didn't I think of that ._.
I'm thinking to fold the card to another side, so that the logo wouldn't be block. 
Basically it'll looks like this.

Front and back (after I fold it)

For the space there, I'll re-arrange the colored squares there. My friend suggested prisms but I don't think it will be consistent with other things. </div>
