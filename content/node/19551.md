body: "Hi folks,\r\nI need to match a font on a job and all I know is the font name
  -- it's called Guild. I managed to get one font from the original artist after they
  couldn't tell me where I could purchase, and indeed there is no foundry listed in
  the font info. This font is similar to Gill Sans, however there are some nice differences
  in the lower case glyphs, such as p, l, g, and note the oldstyle numerals. Boy!
  I want this font! Anyone know where I can buy it?\r\nThanks for your help --\r\nEd\r\n\r\nDoh!
  Can't figure out that inserting/attaching thing -- not working. So, here's a link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tundrastudios.com/guild_sample.jpg"

  body: The i has a tail too, making this similar to the Johnston revivals. I've seen
    a font from knockoff foundry Silver Graphics called Guild Sans, but that one is
    closer to Gill. Odd.

  body: "Thanks -- after some further sleuthing I'm convinced this is a proprietary
    font. The fact it has no foundry or copyright listed in the header of the one
    font I have makes me believe it is not a commercial font, and I'm just going to
    abandon my quest to purchase it. Using TypeTool, I compared some of the glyph
    nodes against my own copies of Gill Sans, and they pretty much match. Somehow
    this font got out of private hands and made it to me. I will replace the font
    in the materials I produce for this client with Gill Sans, mixing it with Monotype's
    Gill Sans SC & OSF for the old style figures. To bad -- it's a nice font...\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help, folks...\r\nEd"

  body: Bliss? Really? I think it's much closer to Gill Sans.

  body: 'Now that I''ve done a little side-by-side I''m confused. Perhaps they started
    with Gill, but mimicked some of the characteristics of Bliss. Specifically the
    d, 2, p, a, l. However, Bliss is more condensed that this sample. '

  body: the lowercase g looks pretty distinctive, so it shouldn't be impossible to
    find. needless to say, i haven't found anything. it's definitely not Gill Sans
    or Bliss though.
