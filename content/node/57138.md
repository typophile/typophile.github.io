body: "Hello there. I have read my way through some of the previous threads on the
  Bulgarian 'peculiarities' in [[Cyrillic]]. I've looked at specimens, but I'm more
  confused now than before. Say I was to design these Bulgarian alternates, what would
  they look like? Are there consensus on the set and shape of the characters? And
  how should I implement them? In the 'locl' feature, stylistic alternate or both
  \u2013 or something else? In other words, help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n/Claus"

  body: "I'd second some confirmation on this re the design.  locl is definitely the
    option, though of course it doesn't hurt to include them as character alternates.
    \ I think it's basically giving them more Latinized shapes, but I also seem to
    recall someone saying that it's just one foundry that produces fonts with them
    in that style.  I could be mistaken though.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea

  body: I'd vote for a stylistic set. I wouldn't necessarily object to locl, but I
    think it makes more sense as a stylistic set. It is true that the style you are
    referring to is dominant in the Bulgarian typographic scene (though by no means
    universal). However, it is not specific to Bulgaria. Many of the so-called Bulgarian
    features are basically upright cursive forms, and can be found in other places
    like Ukraine and Russia. There may be a culture-specific difference between preferred
    upright cursive forms, though. For instance, I don't ever recall seeing a <em>yu</em>
    with an ascender outside of Bulgaria (or <em>ka</em> with an ascender, for that
    matter, although I might be remembering wrong). If I had a lot of time on my hands,
    I might even create several stylistic sets in addition to the default Cyrillic
    forms...

  body: "my vote is for a stylistic set. this issue is similar to the capital eszett
    issue for German IMO: there is a vocal minority lobbying for its/their acceptance,
    but by and large most people likely prefer the traditional forms. but i could
    be wrong, this is just my sense.\r\n\r\nbut as for forms, basically they look
    like upright italic forms. Here is one model that you could follow: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/428260560/in/set-72157600292550299/\r\nof
    course there are other models. You might look at [[Nick Shin]]'s specimen for
    his Modern Suite. http://shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf (p. 24). I believe he
    followed the model as set forth by the Bulgarian foundry Hermesoft.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

  body: also, i agree that the yu with the ascender makes absolutely no sense (to
    me). maybe someone else can explain...

    Set, rather than \"locl\" feature.\r\nI made the Serbian alternates the \"locl\"
    default, and also included them in a stylistic set, for CS2 and glyph palette
    grouping."

  body: For the Serbian forms, I would agree with Nick that making them the locl default
    is a good idea, since I get the sense that they are mandatory for setting Serbian
    text.
