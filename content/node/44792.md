    often as well. A grey for the black might soften it a bit and separate it from
    the \u201980s\u2014but you know what you are going for and how you want it to
    look.\r\n\r\nYou have a repeat image in the HP print piece."

    (esp. the biggest one) bother me as they become \"t\"s, which is confusing. My
    eye wants to read the white text as \"trend\""

    homepage, and other non blog pages, should go. '

  body: "Thanks for the comments guys. I think the grey could be a great option. Know
    what you mean about the f's now you say it. I guess my thought was that I just
    wanted to design it unrestrained and not be held back by anything. I thought that
    as its a website, nothing else, not a company I didnt have to brand the name at
    all, and legibility was not that important in terms of logos or anything. I was
    quite influenced by RayGun music magazine. The whole form over function thingy.
    But I think I definetely need to work on the large F a bit.\r\n\r\nWordpress indeed.
    Im knid of new to blogging actually, as you may have guessed :-)\r\nam just figuring
    it out by reading forums. Will work on the comments.\r\nthanks so much for the
    comments again."

  body: "I actually like your WORK in the portfolio better than the website. Don't
    really know what it is. Maybe your logo. Not to keen on that now that I see in
    your portfolio what you can do, but its a straight up nice and easy website. Easy
    to figure out so I don't waste time on finding my way around - which is very cool.\r\nOne
    more thing. The big fat outline you have on the images in your portfolio kind
    really irritates my eye - without them - your portfolio would look nice, light
    and simply and easy to digest.\r\nLooking forward to you blog though...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This site is very functional and sharp looking.\r\n\r\nThe only thing, I
    would suggest is that you put a contact button all over the place. Also I put
    my phone number on each page. I get people all the time that pick up the phone
    and contact me right away. After all, you really just want them to contact you.\r\n\r\nMark
