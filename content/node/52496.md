    for some contemporary fonts. Gill Sans just doesn\u2019t connect well to contemporary
    high fashion, and that script is too pudgy and the simple flourishes look dated.
    Museo Sans or Gotham Light would work better, combined with one of <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=alejandro%20paul&producttype=TYP\">Ale
    Paul\u2019s sweet scripts</a> should do the trick. You also need to crank up the

  body: "Hi James,\r\n\r\nThanks for the constructive feedback. \r\n\r\nI'm going
    to go with the Museo Sans for three reasons. Firstly I really like the 'M'. It
    feels more appropriate. And I could try the Museo Sans 500 for free - I'm going
    to buy the 300 to see which one looks better once the script is sorted out.\r\n\r\nI
    have looked at the page you suggested and have a strong preference to Burgues
    Script. Is there any reason that you feel that this isn't appropriate?    \r\n "

    I would still like to go with Burgues but I would like to check that this is the
    script that you had in mind. I would just buy it and try it but at a cost of GBP
    69.00 it isn't exactly cheap! "

    has been fun. After playing around with using images in 'Date' it didn't look
    right. In the end I started trying other stuff and having the different Museo
    weights I have done the following. I prefer it to the original. I was wondering
    if anyone had any feedback with regards to leading, kerning or position. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6144.jpg]"

  body: "Hello Doors. I was reading these coments and i'd like to add some considerations,
    in hopes this might help you. a) the word date seems to fall down to the right
    because of its hard angle, maybe it needs some compensation upwords; b) i don't
    like the thickness of the word moss, but if it's something you enjoy, then maybe
    it would work better if you tried to have it smaller but with more space between
    the letters, or with a lighter color; c) my eye gets fixed on the detail of the
    left top of the M in the middle of the D curve, i think it woul be interesting
    to take it off... ? \r\ni'm sorry for my rough english... hope you understood
    my ideas :P "

  body: You might consider joining the "D" and the "t". I do agree though with James
    that you may want to look at more contemporary fonts. Something like neutraface
    by house industries for moss maybe?

  body: To my eye, the "Moss" is way to dominant! For that reason and since "Date
    Moss" is a really nice pun/paronomasia, I would use the same font for both words
    to underline the pun.

    Your comments were helpful! I have altered the angle of 'Date' and I think it
    does improve the 'D'. After lighting 'Moss' I then tried less weight and it I'm
    digging it. Originally I took the 'D' out of the 'M' the design lost something,
    but now that it is more balanced it doesn't seem to need it anymore.\r\n\r\n@jdewtt
    I really like Museo Sans for 'Moss'. I had a look at Neutraface, it's super nice!
    I would like to use it for future projects. I didn't like *some* of House Industries
    other type faces - I appreciate that they are well executed and in the right situation
    they would work but they wouldn't get into my top 20!\r\n\r\n@trickynicky I really
    like the pun as well. I'm not a big pun fan; a magazine I used to work for had
    a pun jar so I have been conditioned not to like them but in this case I found
    it hilarious and sharp witted. \r\n\r\nYour comment about underlining the pun
    played a part in bringing the logo into more balance. I think the improved balance
    goes a long way to underlining the pun!\r\n\r\n"
