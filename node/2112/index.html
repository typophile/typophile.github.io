		<div class="commentbody">Svenni, I'd also humbly suggest you consider legibilty through the entire process. The legibilty of the font has to be balanced with other things like the quality of the paper and dot gain (if we're talking about printed instructions). The most legible font could be foiled by dropping the ball later in the process. I had some very smart safety instructions for a pleasurecraft that were laminated since it's likely you'd need to refer to them while on the water.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I for one think you're on the right track. <BR> <BR>&gt; the way a type design can improve readability is aiding the eye navigation <BR>&gt; trough the text by facilitating the discrimination of the shapes (bouma?) of <BR>&gt; the key elements for its decypheration based on the syntax and morphology <BR>&gt; of the language. <BR> <BR>Yes, but at the type design level (as opposed to writing custom software to dynamically optimize live text or something), you still have to address the individual letterforms. What you can do is map the entire lexicon of Spanish and find the sequences of letters that tend to get confused most, and diverge their constituent letters in key ways. This is not an easy task. For one thing, it requires grammatical sensitivity to work really well. <BR> <BR>BTW, don't focus on Javal's specifics too much: he was a stellar pioneer, but for that reason it was too early for him to be very exact about the details of readability. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>BTW, one can't doubt that Clearview works very well for the intended purpose: highway signage. But to me &quot;readability&quot; refers most to long passages of text (like a book), and just the fact that Clearview is a sans would make it not extremely readable, even though I think it's a highly <i>legible</i>, handsome design. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;  why is most highway signage sanserif <BR> <BR>Part of it is cultural, but there's also the difference between legibility and readability, in terms of the reader having time to decipher a short word in the fovea (by compiling the letters, which have to be highly decipherable in adverse conditions of weather and lighting) versus immersive reading. Sans forms are more decipherable during deliberation. And note for example that highway signage is loosely spaced, while that's anathema in a book. <BR> <BR>BTW, one practical consideration for setting text on a fire extinguisher is that it's on a narrow cylinder, so you want a narrow font (unless you set the text along the length, which might however momentality confuse people), since you don't please having to twist the thing back-and-forth to read lines. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
