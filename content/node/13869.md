  body: "This looks at least partly 'constructed' (the M is poorly made), so I doubt
    it is a font, as you see it. It is very similar in many respects to one of Nick
    Curtis's old freeware fonts called<a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/m.htm\"
    target=\"new\">\"Madison Square\"</a>, which is an inline style. If Nick's around,
    he may be able to suggest closer approximations to this style that he has done.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Sorry, I really can't offer anything that's closer. It's an interesting style,
    though, most likely hand-lettered.
