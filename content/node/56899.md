  an earlier posting, it looks to me that the font is some form of Spoleto (VN). I
  am having difficulty tracking down this font and would appreciate anyone pointing
  me in the right direction of the most compleate version of this script. \r\n\r\nTHANK
  YOU!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It does look like a slight modification of Spoleto, or one of the other versions
    of Sport Script. Other aliases I have noted are Opti Sport Script, Aktuelle, and
    Athletic Script. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/philly-sport-script/|Philly
    Sport Script]] is also pretty close, and may be loosely based on the same design.\r\n\r\nI
    have not been able to find Spoleto available anywhere (although I have the font
    as part of the Expresiv Ornate font collection), and the site that had Aktuelle
    seemed not to be working. Opti fonts are notorious, because their current owner
    (Castcraft) seems unresponsive to any requests for information. Maybe Mike F.
    has more insight about locating this font. We see it often enough that people
    are obviously getting it somewhere.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
