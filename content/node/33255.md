    Anyone?

  body: "The H&FJ fonts identified in the link that Chris provided include 'Exchange',
    which is the body type they designed for the Wall Street Journal. I would suggest
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/berling/\">Berling</a> as an alternative
    to Exchange. It has many of the same structural attributes in certain key letters.\r\n\r\nI
    thought Myriad could be fairly close to the heading Sans type, but you might need
    to tweak the width. At least it's something you might be likely to have already.\r\n\r\n-
