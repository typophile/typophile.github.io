  men's clothes boutique.\r\n\r\nFor the logo I've settled on the Versailles Bold
  typeface but I felt the caps with their sharp serifs could be sweetened with a swash
  of the \"y\". Also, the swash would imitate a signature, in my mind.\r\n\r\nNow
  I'm not a type designer and I shouldn't probably play with things I don't quite
  grasp.\r\n\r\nI'm very curious about what you think."

  body: "I love the \"R\" in Luxury Diamond [img:sites/default/files/old-images/luxuryR_5594.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    reminds me of Prada's \"R\".\r\n\r\nThank you for answering, Fabulous. Please,
    give me some hints about what is there to be done. Is the loop too tight? Is the
    diagonal too thick? Is the whole thing completely bogus and I need to start all
    over again? How much liberty can one take when creating a swash? What are the
    rules?\r\n\r\nI am a self-thought graphic designer and I never took typography
    classes. It may sound silly, bu here's what I reasoned when drawing the swash:
    I imagined holding a broad pen in my hand and drawing the \"y\" with the flourish.
    The diagonal of the swash parallel with the stem in the y should end up being
    of the same visual thickness. Other than that, I figured the whole thing should
    look harmonious (the length of the descender + the swash I tried to balance with
    the rest of the uppercase letters).\r\n\r\nI know that professionally speaking
    I should let someone who actually draws type do this thing, but I'm passionate
    about typography and I aspire to understand the upper crust of its mysteries.\r\n\r\nI
    hope I did not offend anybody. I'm not looking for a quick tutorial, I want to
    understand what would be some basic guidelines in creating this swash."

    about calligraphy nor drawing. However, if you did try drawing this y, even just
    a little\u2014even if you have bad penmanship then you can get a better feel for
    how the loop is supposed to behave. Script and swashes are elevated forms of our
    human writing.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m really not much help, but I for sure like your

    simulated something quickly in illustrator (left). Maybe these will be helpful.\r\n\r\nbest
    suggestion is to NOT drop the loop down, just across.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/y_4597.png]\r\n\r\n\r\ntypically,
    you want to match the stress of your roman, if it has one.\r\n\r\n\r\nperhaps
    you could scrap the roman 'by' and try italic forms?\r\n\r\nalso, there's a great
    opportunity to use a loopy/swashy tail (bottom horiz. stem) on your Z to add some
    Zest. Maybe a tail on your R/\r\n\r\ngood luck\r\n\r\n"

    more natural shapes than what I had in my mind.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, the
    results also filled the space below the \"b\".\r\n\r\nHere's what I settled on.
    This one seems to me more \"alive\", although I'm not sure if it isn't a bit too
    sharp. Or if the loop reads like a \"v\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logosharpswash_3796.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sharpswash_4052.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
    loopier one, like the ones in Beejay's beautiful drawings, may also seem to be
    a good idea, but I need to work on this one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
    roundswash_3621.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs for setting the \"by\" in cursive italics, I'm
    not sure, although maybe a sans serif \"by\" would do the trick here. Here's a
    very lame version with Avenir Medium Oblique for \"by\". Why not?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sansseriflogo_6686.jpg]\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'm
    afraid to start working on the R and the Z, as Beejay suggested. First of all,
    I couldn't do it, second I think it would crowd things a little for this heavy
    face. It would probably work with a lighter one, though.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThank
    you again. I kind of like the first version, the one with the sharp swash. What
    do you think?"

    had to make the straight line thicker, to match the weight of the crossbar. I
    feel it's a little dull like this. Also, the line is now too close to the bowl
    of the \"b\" (wich is a problem at small sizes) and I'd have to make the \"by\"
    a few points smaller to have some extra space in between, wich I don't want (it
    would also make it more difficult to read at small sizes).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is

    and the thin downstroke of the y looks too thin. Actually, I think you need a
    different font as a starting point for \"by\", as beejay suggested above. A more
    pen-written, italic form, that has the same kind of thick/thin patterns your tail
    has."

  body: "Physically, the top of the \"y\" is aligned with the top of the \"A\", if
    I understood correctly what eliason and innovati suggested. But it may not be
    a thing of mathematics here, and now that you told me, the \"by\" seems to me
    also to be a bit high. I'll do some tests tomorrow at work that follow your suggestion.\r\n\r\neliason
    and beejay I think you're asking too much from me. I will look in my archive for
    italic forms and test them with the swash. For amusement I will try drawing the
    \"by\" myself, although I'm certain I couldn't do a better job than what I ended
    up with here (+ minor tweaks). I feel that this swash is a sensitive area in the
    whole concept. Maybe contrast added by a different typeface than Versailles would
    be very welcomed here. I am still afraid, though, about one thing: Versailles
    is a pretty complicated typeface (to my eyes) and adding another detailed face
    next to it might be too much. If the main font would be a sans serif, a swashy
    italic form for the \"by\" would surely look sweet, I think.\r\n\r\nBut as I've
    learned in my short time here, rationalizing may not lead to the best results.
    So enough talking - on to testing.\r\n\r\ninnovati, your thoughts are very encouraging.
    I enjoy this more than I can say."

    right about the italic forms - they go better with swashes. But they also seem
    to be more feminine and a little bit too much for my concept. Maybe cotdamn is
    right and I shouldn't emphasize the \"by\" so as not to overwhelm the important
    stuff.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the \"Original\" with the sharp signature-like swash is
    still the best to me.\r\n\r\nI'll have to think about it more and do some more
