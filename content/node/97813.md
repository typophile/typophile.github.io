  you have to offer would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI am redesigning a science
  and technology magazine that uses Officina Sans for the body text. Right now the
  masthead is Serpentine, pagination is Eurostyle, the deck and some headlines are
  Avenir and some heads are Trade Gothic (as are the dropcaps). \r\n\r\nNeedless to
  say, the result is very heavy and chaotic. I am looking to streamline the number
  of fonts and create a lighter,  more contemporary look. Any suggestions for fonts
  that would pair well with Officina Sans for Headlines, pagination, and masthead?
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time."

    close spacing is deft and precise\u2014a light touch, as it were.\r\n\r\nMy <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/\">Sense</a> has similar proportions
    to Of\uFB01cina Sans, and like Of\uFB01cina Display is tightly \uFB01tted and
    kerned for heads and decks.\r\n\r\nFor the masthead, I would suggest trying many
    widely different options and see what they look like in situ, and trust your own
    taste to be slightly (but not too much) ahead of the readership, in choosing two
    or three options to present to a focus group.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes! Sense is a beautiful, beautiful font. It's exactly what I was looking
    for. Thanks for recommending it, Nick (and also for anticipating my needs by about
    2 years).
