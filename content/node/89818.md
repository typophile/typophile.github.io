body: "hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm doing abbreviation studies for an event my school is having,
  and its more focused on bringing together designers, educators, students, and social
  innovators to discuss the 'new frontier\" of the jobs emerging for the deigned committed
  to making social impact in the world of non-profits, companies, and social enterprises.
  the school wants this to be a morph of a symposium and a conference; more interactive,
  encourage dissuasions, and come up with ideas and solutions. so i thought \"lab\"
  would be nice, and so does my professor. but he wants me to push that idea and think
  of what L.A.B. can stand for. EX: \"SONAR\" stands for SOund NAvigation & Ranging.
  i was wondering if you guys can help me think of what LAB can stand for, I'm kind
  of stuck.\r\n\r\nsome ideas i thought of were:\r\n\r\nLift All Boundries\r\nand\r\nLending
  Artists Breadth\r\n\r\nnote: it can be L______ of A_____ and B______\r\n\r\nthanks!"
