body: I&#39;m in the initial process of developing a logo for a friend&#39;s business,
  My PC Handyman. I&#39;m looking for some concepts to work up. It&#39;s a little
  bit of a clunky name, but I think there&#39;s potential as well. I have considered
  using a toolbox theme, a more digital theme, as well as his idea of a figure carrying
  a computer. <BR> <BR>My concern is the name and if I add a graphic that it might
  be distracting to the name. I&#39;m also conerned about the &#39;PC&#39; part. I
  don&#39;t want it to get lost and hopefully PC is interpretted properly. <BR> <BR>Any
  thoughts? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Adam
