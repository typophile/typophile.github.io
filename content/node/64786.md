  looking for something which would help with localizing name tables, so I'm primarily
  interested in commonly used names for font weights, widths, and other terms frequently
  found in font names (italic, small caps, etc) in a variety of languages along with
  any gender or case rules which might be relevant to constructing font names.\r\n\r\nAny
  pointers would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
