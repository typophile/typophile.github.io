    Strang, The \"King\" of Beaver Island, on bronze  tablets?\r\n\r\n<cite>As had
    Joseph Smith before him, Strang claimed to be blessed by heavenly visions, and
    claimed that an angel had appeared before him, revealing the location of an account
    of an ancient people and their dingbat font, buried in a hill south of White River
    bridge.</cite>"

  body: What's so weird about that?  I mean, Martin Luther invited those weird letters
    they use to use in northern Europe.  Thankfully they come to know Jesus Christ
    Our Lord and Savior and switched to the alphabet he invented and we use today.
