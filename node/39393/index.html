<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Not to get all mushy or anything, but... I'd like to thank all those that make this 'place' as rich as it is. From the brilliant design and maintenance of Typophile - to the one time poster, it's all good.
For me, I constantly push/search. I'm looking for the edge - the raw edge - the leading edge. And I think those that put together Typophile knew that it would enable leading minds a place to share - to challenge - to encourage - us/one another.
And I thank you all for that...

Cheers to that, Hiroshige. I think that all too often we take Typophile for granted, so this is a great opportunity to say thanks to everyone who puts in so much time and care, whether it is the kind folks at Punchcut, or the moderators, or the users.</div>

>In spite of not being Christian, I really must say Amen to that!
FYI: "Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "it is true," or "so be it"--exactly as you use it--and was part of Jewish liturgy for many centuries before Christianity came around. The word for faith, "emunah" is from the same root, as is the word for truth, "emet". </div>

<div class=commentbody>Typophile proves a lot about what it means to be human, to have intelligent, mindful friends we can share our thoughts with, about the value of being candid. Tolerance goes a long way towards keeping affairs here civil. Unlike so many other places on the internet we barely need a code of civil conduct.
It's just amazing how fair people can be.

I have been interested in typography for quite some time now, but this place has taken it to a totally new level. I've learned a lot from people here, and enjoyed every moment. The only problem is the amount of time I sometimes end up spending here instead of working or sleeping. On the other hand, time spent doing what you like is not wasted.
Thank you. </div>

Lots of provocative ideas to bat around, and the technical assistance I get from Thomas, John, Miguel, Adam etc. is absolutely priceless, as well as the insight into what makes hardcore "users" like Patty, Tiffany and Charles tick.

<div class=commentbody>I knew I forgot two! Yves, I know you're there on the ID board but I rarely visit (I read your column at typographer.org), but thanks so much for the great service you provide to type users. Seasons greeting Eben :^) I didn't know we had six mods. The typophile Sera Senshi Sentai Six (pretty sailor-soldier guardian magical girl team ;^)

<div class=commentbody>Thanks! And best wishes to you all as well. I would offer my own pile of heartfelt sweet mushiness for all the help, insight and technical know how that has been made available to us all - but you all have been eloquent already!

Totally. I am working on a scheme to replace some indoor bulbs this way too. It's tricker than I would like but it obviously needs doing.</div>
