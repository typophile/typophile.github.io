    draw on influences or sources also seen in other faces.\r\n\r\nI rather like their
    take on German and American highway signage (DIN and Highway Sans), and see some
    features I like better than similar offerings from Fontshop (FF Din) and Font
    Bureau (Interstate).\r\n\r\nParachute seems to enjoy introducing a bit of funkiness
    into their heavier weights, which I also enjoy.\r\n\r\nAs for Agora, its three
    iterations (sans/serif/slab) would make a nice corporate identity package."

  body: "As a new member (this is my second time around) and not having made any friends
    yet in this forum, I feel being in an awkward position to defend several years
    of work as a type designer and the 7+ years of Parachute\u2019s existence.  Parachute
    may be new to you (our site just went up a few months ago), but we are well established
    in the local market.\r\nIf we were to believe member \u2018raa\u2019s\u2019 unacceptable
    title, then corporations such as Ikea, Vodafone, Nestle, Unilever, BBDO, McCann
    Erickson, JWT, Saatchi & Saatchi, DDB, Leo Burnett, TBWA, Ogilvy & Mather, National
    Geographic, Playboy, Elle, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, PC Magazine, Votre Beaute, National
    Bank of Greece, and so many others must be doing something wrong being our clients.\r\nWell
    known design agencies in Germany, England and the United States must have been
    out of their minds when they purchased PF Agora Sans Pro. \r\nSchools and conference
    \ organizers must be doing something wrong when they invite us as guest speakers.\r\nThe
    awards we received over the last few years should not have been given to us.\r\n\r\nLet
    me invite you all to visit our site [[http://www.parachute.gr]] and spend some
    time reading all about Parachute before you make any rush judgments. Read about
    each and every typeface, read how they were made, when they were made, how they
    differ, what more they have to offer, download the 30+ page pdfs and see for yourself.
    \ We do not claim some high degree of originality here, but *only to the same
    level as other companies do*.\r\n\r\nInfluences? Yes a lot. But don\u2019t you
    see this in all new faces? As Goudy once said \u201Cthe old guys stole our best
    ideas\u201D. If originality was questioned, in this harsh and inappropriate way,
    anytime each one of us spotted some sort of \u2018inspiration\u2019 from another
    source, then all existing new faces would have been knockoffs to different people
    for different reasons. I myself, and assume many of you, every time I look at
    typefaces I find similarities to other ones. This does not necessarily mean one
    is a knockoff of the other.\r\nA knockoff is a cheap almost-identical or simply
    identical version of an existing original typeface and definitely not something
    you have created from scratch and of course not something that is based on public
    domain material. \r\nParachute fonts, as member \u2018aluminum\u2019 mentioned,
    are expensive. Imagine that. A knockoff that expensive!!  Who are you kidding
    \u2018raa\u2019?  Parachute fonts are original as much as others can be, very
    well crafted and designed to offer more than other competitive typefaces, simultaneously
    supporting Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nIf we were to be blamed for designing
    some highly competitive typefaces like the Din Text Pro Series, Highway Sans Pro
    etc, which were created using original public domain sources in the most ethical
    way (old manuscripts, manuals for major standards, historic catalogs), then we
    are guilty as charged. Nothing to hide, just read the credits. I\u2019m glad that
    members like \u2018marcox\u2019 have already picked their favorite.\r\nBut if
    we were to be judged based on one member\u2019s misconception then that makes
    me really mad.\r\n\r\nBy the way 'raa', to save up some time to you looking for
    demons, PF Agora Sans Pro was based on PF Agora Serif Pro as well as some older
    incomplete commisioned work. Period. \r\n\r\nI thought that Typophile is a forum
    that deals with typography issues to the extend that would not allow its members
    damage a company\u2019s reputation with such vague comments.\r\nOtherwise thanks
    but no thanks \u2018Miss Tiffany\u2019 for rephrasing the title. I don\u2019t
    think you believe that made things much less harsh.\r\n \r\nI would like to see
    some of you out there question the \u201Clegit typefaces\u201D that big  companies
    offer using the same unacceptable comments as member \u2018raa\u2019 so light-heartedly
    used and then you\u2019ll see how fast and hard they will come down on you. Myself,
    I\u2019ll stick to this honest answer and hopefully it is appreciated.\r\n\r\n-I
    feel that your title is inappropriate, offensive and should be altered.\r\n-Dirt
    may be washed off but bad stain stays there forever.\r\n-If only, a small company
    like Parachute would have expected your support.\r\n\r\n-Panos Vassiliou\r\n"

    to its sources of inspiration -- less geometric and more typographic, most obviously
    in the italics, but even in the joins and shapes of the roman.\r\n\r\nWhether
    that would be enough to entice someone who already owned FF or FB versions to
    license the PF version, I don't know. (PF's DIN Display is an entirely different
    animal that could happily coexist with FF Din as body copy.)\r\n\r\nBut that's
    not really the point -- why can't we have multiple DINs along with our dozens
    of Garamonds?"

    unlimited budgets for font licenses--at some point, choices need to be made. I'd
    love to have the resources to license every quality font out there, the \"just-in-case\"
    design scenario--but realistically, I tend to shy away from designs that are just
    \"five percent\" moves from fonts I already have licensed. \r\n\r\nTwelve Garamonds?
    Yikes. Five is plenty for me; and one of them isn't even a Garamond at all (ITC).\r\n"

    that we should be more careful to rush to judgements based on the lack of Google
    presence (especially if that is due to being active mostly in a non-Western market
    separated by a different writing system as well as language).\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    I would like to hear what people think of PF Centro Pro, including the Greek and
    Cyrillic designs. The Greek has some obvious details, like some serifs in the
    lowercase, that many of the Greek experts here would consider inauthentic but
    are in keeping with many of the contemporary designs produced in Greece."
