  body: "This could be the Bitstream version of Handel Gothic, or a typeface based
    on Handel, called Fourche:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/handel-gothic/\r\nhttp://www.shyfoundry.com/fonts/shareware/sffourche.html\r\n\r\nNOTE:
    only the Bitstream version of Handel has the straight-legged R and the rounded
    U--all the others have a curved leg R and/or a U with one straight side. \r\n\r\nTSVOI
    looks artificially widened, if it is Fourche."

  body: Thanks, I checked SF Fourche out and it truly seems to have been slightly
    widened for the logo. But it's definitely a right fit.
