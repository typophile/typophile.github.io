    the FontLab manual, the chapter on writing Feature code, and\r\n2. Visit [[http://opentypecookbook.com/index.html
    | OpenType Cookbook]] for more information;\r\n3. After learning the basics, Typophile
    would be helpful for specific issues.\r\n\r\nBest of luck."

  body: "First, I'll second the recommendation of the OpenType Cookbook as a reference
    and guide!\r\n\r\nIn the OpenType panel....\r\n\r\nYour main code in the top right
    pane will look something like this, only with as many substitutions as you need.
    (You can also simplify the code here by creating classes, but that's another story.):\r\n<code><pre>\r\nfeature
    ss01 {\r\n    sub A by A.alt ;\r\n    sub B by B.alt ;\r\n} ss01;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nIn
    the lower right pane, you'll need languagesystem statements. At a minimum this
    will be something like the code below. If you support other writing systems, or
    have language-specific code in your font, it will get more complex (both here
    and in your code pane):\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nlanguagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn dflt;\r\n</code>"
