  body: "<cite>...I would suggest skipping PDF and making true HTML based web forms.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    good advice, Darrel. The forms would be easier to create in HTML and you'll have
    a lot more freedom for any additional features outside to a few check boxes and
    text input fields. It they're able to access PDF's online they'll be able to access
    a web page. If you do use PDFs, I'd refrain from making them interactive. The
    process is time consuming and sometimes it's just plain frustrating. Consider
    them a print and fill solution only. "

    enough really big libraries available that do, so you won't be shorting yourself
    in ignoring the ones that have restrictive licenses.\r\n\r\nAs for font types,
    look for sans serifs, which work well at small sizes. A large x-height is also

  body: Keep in mind that converting text to outlines will look like utter cr*p in
    versions of Acrobat Reader prior to 6 (no anti-aliasing of vector art). As far
    as font choice, I have done literally HUNDREDS of medical forms in the past 20
    years or so, and Helvetica Condensed or Univers 47 & 57 have seen the heaviest
    use.

    personally I find it just a little more friendly than Univers. The condensed versions
    of both Myriad and Frutiger might also work well, although I know nothing about
    the .pdf embedding permissions or restrictions contained in the EULAs of any of
    these.

    a red flag. Why wouldn't you want to use something that works well, just because
    others have used it? Don't think that a designers job is to make things that are
    unique ... it is to make things that are usable. A form is a case where utilitarianism
    is probably the key requirement of a job. If you want to put your personal stamp
    on the project, then do so in the header and other elements of the form. \r\n\r\nKeep
    the body of the form (labels, etc.) as clear and simple as possible. Your clients
    will love it if your work minimizes mistakes and omissions, and will completely
    ignore whether it looks unique.\r\n\r\nOne thing, while Freight Sans does look
    nice don't try to physically compress it ... this usually spoils the readability
    of a font.\r\n\r\nAnd don't reject Helvetica Condensed because \"real designers
    don't use Helvetica.\" It is Helvetica that is over used, not Helvetica Condensed."

  body: 'I would look at faces that stand up well to poor printing and photocopying.
    If they are pdfs, they will inevitably be printed out on a lo-res laser printer
    at some point. And forms will almost certainly be photocopied. I would also look
    at faces with distinct numerals. I would suggest Officina (sans or serif), Meta,
    or maybe FF Strada (which according to the fontfont blurb is intended for forms).
    They are robust enough to stand up to abuse. I would steer clear of any width
    of Helvetica, because at small sizes, poorly reproduced, the numerals can look

  body: "At this point Helvetica and Univers condensed are not appropriate choices
    because their usefulness for forms has been superseded by a host of new designs
    that are easier to read in the same settings, and as a side benefit, are probably
    more economical. Choosing them now means that you have them sitting around, and
    it's easy because we're all used to seeing them on forms and we don't question
    that. Being habituated to their use doesn't make them the best choice. \r\n\r\nFreight
    is terrific but probably wrong for forms. The whole slew of vaguely-humanist,
    somewhat condensed info sans designs would be easy to mine for something appropriate.
    Consider Amplitude, Fago, Page Sans & Serif, Strada Condensed, Zwo, Slate Condensed,
    the Mentor family (serif and sans), Zemestro, etc. Lots of new options including
    superfamilies, width variants, and finely-tuned weights. "

    is one of my favorite faces and it's usefullness and versatility are undisputed.
    But we can all agree it's a bit over used (both regular and condensed). Any serious
    designer, who can afford it ofcourse, should have a copy of it's complete family
    in there type arsenal (I know I do). I always consider appropriateness and usability
    in my designs. Then, and only then, do I consider personal taste. \r\nHelvetica
    isn't the only choice out there as you have probably noticed from the input of
