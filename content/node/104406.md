  \ \r\n\r\n1. Scan.\r\n2. Vectorize in Illustrator [using ImageTrace in AI CS6].\r\n3.
  Copy and paste individual glyphs into FontLab.\r\n\r\nI used to be satisfied with
  this workflow, but now that I'm making more fonts, I really want the ability to
  import multiple characters/glyphs at once, so that I don't have to go back and forth
  copying and pasting over a hundred times per typeface. All of my characters start
  out together in a single AI file. Is there any way to get them into FontLab (or
  Glyphs) all at once as separate glyphs?"

    to vectorize automatically, tracing the scanned image in one step with the Image
    Trace feature (previously called Live Trace).  \r\n\r\nI didn't think you could
    do that in FontLab without also buying their ScanFont app, which I am trepidatious
    about because a) it hasn't been updated in six years, and b) Illustrator has gotten
    pretty good at tracing bitmaps over the last few releases."

    the part in the video where he says that the script creates a \"fully built, properly
    spaced font\"\u2014you'll still need to do plenty of building and spacing in FontLab."

  body: "ScanFont provides a really quick way to get Illustrator art into FontLab.
    You basically open the Illustrator document in ScanFont, adjust the scaling factor,
    and export as a FontLab file (or into an open FontLab file).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    they haven't released an Intel-native version yet, so it can't run on Mac OS 10.7
    or 10.8 natively. In the mean time, it is possible to run the Windows version
    on a Mac in a VM or similar."

    immediately asked for a refund. Successfully, because they know they sell a product
    which does not work as described. I wrote them back in 2007:\r\n\r\n<em>I just
    bought ScanFont 5 and I am very disappointed. It simply doesn't work. When I try
    to import EPS file (saved as EPS for Adobe Illustrator 3 and other versions),
    it doesn't work at all. \"File is damaged or contain invalid data.\". When I try
    to export the curves to FontLab, it says \"Unable to find FontLab server application\"
    followed by \"FontLab server is not responding in time. Pleas witch (!) to FontLab
    and close unnecessary modal dialogs.\" Of course, there are no opened dialogs
    in FL.</em>\r\n\r\nThey sent me some kind of a workaround which was not useful
    anyway. There was no way to use ScanFont with vector data on my Windows 64bit
    system."

  body: I think is is a bit of a stretch to state that because it did not work well
    on a 64-bit Windows system 6 years ago, that there is an issue with it on Windows
    today. (I'm not saying there is no issue, but it seems like a bit of a leap.)

    However, when I exported the file as EPS without the header, it worked fine\u2014as
    least, the scanned images opened in FontLab. But, there must be some trick I'm
    overlooking, because the baseline of the outlines placed in FontLab were all over
    the place."

  body: "There is another route for auto-tracing-in-batch and it\u2019s a free one
    too. The <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/Downloads/Light/Windows/FM_Light_270.msi.zip\">Light
    version</a> of DTL FontMaster contains a fully functional version of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WNDdGu9Pqg\">TraceMaster</a>.
    \ With TM you can auto-trace multiple TIFF \uFB01les at once and convert these
    to a BE glyph database. Open the BE \uFB01le in BezierMaster (Light), generate
    a PS Type1 font and open this in whatever font tool you prefer (or stick to BM).
    Another option is to trace in IKARUS format and to use TransType to convert the
    IK \uFB01le to any other format.\r\n\r\nAlthough the auto-tracer in Illustrator
    CS6 is pretty good IMHO (much better than in previous versions), TM is the best
    auto-tracer in our and any other parallel universe (really!). The algorithms were
    developed decades ago by Dr. J\xFCrgen Willrodt for a large American type foundry
    that lost all IKARUS data and that had to convert printed glyphs in a jiffy (it\u2019s
    blazingly fast too). It\u2019s a bit older technology though, and therefore there
    are a few restrictions:\r\n\r\n\u2013the TIFF \uFB01le should be a B/W bitmap\r\n\u2013no
    layers nor any compression are allowed\r\n\r\nYou could give it a try. My students
    are in general quite pleased with it.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"
