  body: "The funny thing is that when I posted this I was originally looking for the
    Dashiell Hammett font.  I was interested in the rough edges and the seemingly
    overinked quality of the A, and M. Does anyone else have any ideas about this
    one?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dashiell2_3724.jpg]"
