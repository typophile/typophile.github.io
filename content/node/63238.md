  don't hold back. This is still very much in the conceptual stage. I want to get
  feedback and assistance before I do the fine tuning.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also have a few
  questions.\r\n\r\n1. How is the ratio of height/width?\r\n\r\n2. What degree of
  angle should I use for all the diagonals? Does it look weird to mix it up a little?\r\n\r\n3.
  Do the ambicase styles of \"N\" and \"Y\" work?\r\n\r\n4. Should I slightly angle
  vertical and horizontal lines to compensate for optical distortions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for taking a look!\r\n\r\n_eric\r\n\r\n** EDITED Oct.19.2009: changed title from

  body: "I think it looks quite interesting, although its looks a bit more like a
    'techno' font than a fraktur. A, O and T do have real fraktur characteristics,
    the rest is more hybrid. This is fine, if that's what your going for. I think
    it is also hard because fraktur typefaces are hardly ever set in all caps (except
    perhaps for one or two words) and for good reason: it is almost illegible in all
    caps! So I guess if you want to make this work as caps only you will have to go
    for this kind of hybrid.\r\n\r\nI can't answer all your specific question (simply
    cause I don't know) but I'll give my voice on some.\r\n\r\n1. I think this is
    pretty good, it's got enough light in it to keep it legible.\r\n3. I think this
    looks nice, and if your going for a hybrid, this would fit.\r\n\r\nGood luck with
    it and keep us posted on your progress\r\n\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

    mix of curves and angles. I let the characters resolve their differences between
    themselves. As it turns out, they voted curves off the island.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the feedback."

    \  perhaps it is because it is the letter A.\r\nKeep up the good work!!\r\n\r\ndid
    you try the A and O like this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dirt_4743.jpg]"

  body: "Good look, Kay! Thanks for the feedback! Your changes are good ones. That
    brings \"A\" and \"O\" closer to the rest of the glyphs. Alas, I have put this
    typeface on hold for awhile which I look for a job.\r\n\r\nI'm just starting out
    with FontLab and designing my own fonts. I think I will work on something more
    conventional before revisiting this face. And, of course, anything I work on will
    be posted here to get all the help I possibly can. I will hit you up for feedback
    in the future, if you don't mind."
