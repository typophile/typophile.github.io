body: 'I am glad to participate in this forum. <BR>This is the news from Japan. <BR>Typeface
  named &#34;AXIS FONT&#34; was put on the market in Japan last month. <BR>This typeface
  was developed as an exclusive typeface of a Japanese design magazine &#34;AXIS&#34;
  in 2001. <BR>In Japan, it is very rare that the typeface of exclusive use is developed&#40;except
  newspapers&#41;, and this project can be called very epoch-making thing. Because,
  since no less than at least 9000 characters&#40;Adobe-Japan 1-3&#41; are needed
  per one weight, Japanese is not easy to develop an exclusive typeface. Very much
  time and money are needed. <BR> <BR>7 weights of family are contained in this typeface.
  In many cases, development of a Japanese typeface is performed by several persons.
  <BR>However, Isao Suzuki who superintends this project designed most of these typefaces
  alone. <BR> <BR>Since this design magazine &#34;AXIS&#34; is put on the market not
  only Japan but overseas, Japanese and English are written together. Therefore, in
  order to design this typeface so that Japanese and the Latin alphabet may combine
  beautifully from the time of development, and to fulfill the condition, Akira Kobayashi&#40;now
  he is Type director : Linotype Library GmbH&#41; designed the alphabet. <BR> <BR>You
  can see this typefaces in the following address. <BR><a href="http://www.typeproject.com/"

    a Japanese typeface  <BR>is not only time-demanding, it&#39;s really a harder
    task than  <BR>desigining Latin. How to design a glyph with 36 strokes? ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The Axis typeface is very nice. Did you work on the project  <BR>too?

    in a way as to take account of linguistics, and produce true harmony. <BR> <BR>I
    only worry that the Latin component looks more like a subordinate match to the
    Japanese - it might be too bland to be able to carry entire articles in parallel
    &#40;as I understood from your explanation&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    have not participated in this project. However, I am also looking at this project
    with a big interest. <BR>Although I have seen various forums recently, there is
    no information about a typeface of Japan anywhere. The Japanese typeface is developed
    and sold also in Japan every year. I think that I also want the man in the world
    to know such situations. <BR> <BR>I am a Japanese, However, it is interested in
    the Latin alphabet, and I am under work so that it can put on the market in the
    future. In my country, the alphabet is an element indispensable to a design, and
    I think that many Japanese Latin alphabet designers continue to be born. Like
    Mr. Akira Kobayashi. <BR>

    typeface requires designing every single Kanji, just as designing a Latin face

    I went there again and found some few things about the Latin companion &#40;BTW,
    what a confusing website they have&#41;: <BR> <BR>Akira Kobayashi joined the project
    in April 1999 &#40;the Axis project started in 1998&#41;, and the typeface was
    completed in July 2000. The 3 principles for its design were: <BR>1. To make it
    a little less elegant than Frutiger, and a little less &#34;cool&#34; than Meta.
    <BR>2. Big x-height. <BR>3. Slightly condensed &#40;a little less than Meta&#41;.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>I guess the thing is, a Japanese typeface needs to be quite neutral
    to handle its inherent complexity. It&#39;s probably impossible to design a Japanese
    Rotis, for example. ;-&#41; <BR>So, it&#39;s natural that a Latin companion to
    a Japanese typeface looks neutral too. Maybe too much neutral &#40;bland&#41;

    most 30 strokes.  <BR> <BR>A character with 30 strokes needs many devices. Since
    these characters must be drawn into the square of the same size as a character
    with few strokes, each stroke is made thin and the whole is homogenize tone. It

    In fact, it can be said that not only Latin alphabet but also a Chinese character
    of the AXIS FONT is a bland design compared with many of other Japanese typefaces.
    It is reasonable in the AXIS FONT being a quiet design. <BR> <BR>The AXIS magazine
    has carried many photographs and illustrations. It is a very graphical magazine.
    In order not to break balance with a photograph, I consider a typeface as it is
    better to be a bland design. Therefore, it may not be omnipotent. <BR>It will
    be easy to make it harmonize, when carrying many photographs and illustrations.
    There was neither a photograph nor an illustration in the AXIS magazine, and probably,
    it became a tedious page if it was only the AXIS FONT. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'This is <b>great</b>! This is one of the most harmoneous CJK/Latin combination
    I have seen! Kobayashi&#39;s Latin is a beautiful type in its own right, but it
    was designed to make mixed Latin/Japanese setting as painless as possible. I have
    great respect for Japanese type designers for paying attention to every detail,
    and even take great care to designing a supposedly &#39;subordinate&#39; set of
    foreign characters. Well done. The Japanese characters are beautiful too, but
    I really can&#39;t see how that could be different from other Gothic typefaces...
    I need to see it as a block of text to really get a feeling of it. Kunihiko, do
    you have a sample page from the magazine, in PDF format? Also, as a Chinese, I
    need to see more Kanji characters! <BR> <BR><i>BTW, one of the things I can&#39;t
    stand these days in Japanese culture is the crescent use of English words, specially
    when written/printed. Sure, there are inevitable words, but there&#39;s a lot
    of unnecessary use of it too.</i> <BR> <BR>The same is true for Chinese, especially
    the Hong Kong Chinese. Chinese text dotted with large numbers of English words
    is a nightmare for typesetters, since the spacing and texture of the page is disturbed
    by the proportional spacing, sometimes completely destroyed if it gets too obsessive.
    That&#39;s why well-designed matching Latin character sets for CJK fonts are really
    important. I try to avoid using English words when I write or speak Chinese as
    much as possible, but it&#39;s very difficult since I live in North America. I
    have a better excuse than the people in Hong Kong or China though! <BR> <BR><i>I
    doubt that designing a Japanese typeface requires designing every single Kanji,
    just as designing a Latin face doesn&#39;t require us to design each word but
    just to consider the possible combinations.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, for Kanjis there
    are 8 basic strokes, or building blocks, but there are many different permutations
    that these stokes can appear in. Then there are radicals. Radicals can appear
    as single characters or combined with others to make up characters. That means
    they have to appear in different porportions/sizes according to the amount of
    space available for that radical in a particular character. Sometimes when the
    space is limited, the stroke widths have to be reduced so that the character doesn&#39;t
    look too dense. So, you can decide how you want the basic &#39;building blocks&#39;
    to look overall, but really you have to &#39;design&#39; each and every character.
    Not an easy task, and certainly not a task for a sigle type designer. Afterall,
    9,000 characters does mean 9,000 separate glyphs that have to be designed! <BR>
    <BR>My Chinese dictionary doesn&#39;t have any characters over 36 strokes. <BR>
    <BR><i>I guess the thing is, a Japanese typeface needs to be quite neutral to
    handle its inherent complexity.</i> <BR> <BR>Not true! There are some extremely
    complex and intricate designs around, like an ultra-bold rounded with overlapping
    strokes! <BR> <BR>The following PDF shows some not so harmoneous Latin/Chinese

  body: Wow, thank you for that! <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s interesting that in the vertical
    setting the &#34;20&#34; is horizontal but the &#34;10,000&#34; is not only vertical,
    it also looks so strange &#40;to me&#41;! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Various ways of the setting of numerals were shown. <BR>When we set chraracter
    vertically, in the case of the double-Arabic-figures as shown in &#34;20&#34;,
    sometimes it may set horizontally.  <BR>In this example text, &#34;10000&#34;
    is Chinese numerals. Therefore, it is set vertically. <BR>Generally, in order
    to show age and the date, we don&#39;t use two kinds of methods of the setting
    at a time. <BR>And when we set a text vertically, we use Chinese numerals. While
    horizontally setting, we use Arabic numerals. However, it is not a strict rule
    but recommendation. <BR>

    <BR><i>&#62;My Chinese dictionary doesn&#39;t have any characters over 36 strokes.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Yeah, I could only find 33 strokes in my dictionary. :-/ <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Not
    true! There are some extremely complex and intricate designs around, &#40;...&#41;</i>
    <BR> <BR>Sure. I wasn&#39;t clear enough in my previous post... <BR>I was thinking
    about text typefaces. For example, in your &#40;Keith&#41; sample, almost all
    the typefaces are for display. Nice typefaces &#40;I really like that 2nd, from
    top to bottom&#41;, but certainly not text typefaces &#40;for setting magazines
    and books, for example&#41;. It becomes clearer in CJK that calligraphy and typography
    have different goals. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR><i>&#62;International flavor without actually
    experiencing anything foreign</i> <BR> <BR>See, that&#39;s &#42;the&#42; issue,
    like Hrant pointed out too. <BR>BTW, I wrote, more than a week ago: &#34;crescent
    use of English words&#34;. I meant &#34;growing use of English words&#34;. Sorry.
    <BR> <BR><i>&#62;&#40;...&#41; the lack of good Latin companions to Japanese faces.</i>
    <BR> <BR>I wonder why most of the Latin companions &#40;to Japanese typefaces&#41;
    have huge x-height, and very small descenders &#40;check Keith&#39;s sample, the
    7th typeface&#41;. On the other hand, the Axis&#39; Latin companion is really
    very nice.'
