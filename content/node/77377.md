body: "This is a concept I've had for a while, that I've only recently  began to digitize.
  \ It started from the idea of an i, in which the principal stroke and the tittle
  form a diagonal slice. Here's my original freehand sketch:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawing_6269_4212.jpeg]\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to perhaps turn this idea into a legible gothic typeface with a high x-height,
  round, open letterforms, and ascenders/descenders/tittles with slanted, angular
  ends. Here it is digitized in Fontographer:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thistle1_3962.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  lowercase letterforms:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thistle2_6534.png]\r\n\r\nAt
  the moment, Thistle seems better suited for a display font (it could make an excellent
  logotype). It's surprisingly legible at smaller sizes (although much of the distinguishing
  slanted strokes and tittles become lost).\r\n\r\nHere's an example at a smaller
  size in a sentence:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thistle_3911.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
  still very much an inchoate idea (and I'm still a complete novice!), but I wanted
  to share with you what I've created so far.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts, and
  any ideas for the capitals, numbers, and symbols!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTrevor"

    has too much of an Arial vibe. However, why the different angle on s, c, and e?"

  body: "Thanks Riccard.  I agree with you - I'd like to distinguish it a bit from
    the ubiquitous Arial's and Franklin Gothic's of the world, but I wanted to be
    wary of overdoing the slanted strokes and thorned ear of the g.  The balance between
    convention and personality is pretty difficult to find, but I'm going to keep
    working at it!\r\n\r\nAs for the different angles, I believe that's just a mistake
    - thanks for pointing it out."

    up its gimmick (not too seem cynical; it's just the right word here). I think
    what the font needs is to be taken back to the drawing board and reimagined holistically.
    Rather than \"a sans-serif with slanted terminals,\" something like \"an edgy
    sans-serif.\" Make the slants a symptom of the font's core attributes, not the
    reason for the font.\r\n\r\nThat hotel is really close (and that the name is the
    same is unnerving, I'm sure) but that doesn't mean you should abandon this idea."
