  a serif font as my semester assignment, but I know next to nothing about typedesign
  and got until june. 10 to finish this.\r\n\r\nI have drawn some of the letters(o,a,b,g
  and n if I remember correctly) and scanned them before I started redrawing them
  in Fontlab 5.\r\nThe intention is to make a typeface for print but Im not sure how
  it will turn out yet.\r\n \r\nHere is most what I have done so far(sorry for lack
  of spacing/kerning):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontscreen_5964.jpg]"

    and Palatino, but mainly im just looking at Garamond to see how the shapes are
    on the different glyphs.. \r\nFeels like im just making a mess after writing this..\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hold off on kerning, but start setting your default sidebearings now. And
    then review what you have in actual words rather than in the alphabet. How the
    letters work together is more important than how they look by themselves.

  body: "Some comments: \r\n/f/ should have a negative right sidebearing. Its crossbar
    is also too short.\r\nAlso, you want the right sidebearings of /j/ and /q/ to
    be approximately the same. \r\nThe tittles are flying dangerously low.\r\nBottom
    of /j/ looks too thick.\r\nRevise the bottom of /c/ and /e/."
