  body: "Paddington, eh? Interesting.\r\n\r\nHad you not said that Bojev I'd have
    suggested the more obvious Gill Sans as a working alternative. Eric Gill worked
    closely with Johnston on the Railway Type project and the later Gill Sans bears
    more than a passing resemblance to Johnston. Without grabbing Gill's biography
    I have a recollection that he worked so closely with Johnston that he drew a lot
    of the Railway Type designs for him. I could be wrong on that though. There are
    obvious differences, but in spirit it's frequently very close. Well, bar the diamond
    i and j dots and Gill Sans' interchangable 1I and l."

  body: "It is neither here nor there as they, Gill and Johnston, do look alike in
    many ways... But, IIRC from my own research on Perpetua, Eric only attended 3
    meetings in the beginning of the development. \r\n\r\nI think Johnston is much
    more Geometric and adheres too much to the circle for my taste."
