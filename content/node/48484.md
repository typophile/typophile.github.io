  of reasons to procrastinate) and it should look nice (never mind the content...).\r\n\r\nSo
  I was having a look around and at the moment I have decided on Neutra Text Light
  for titling and headings and Jenson for the copy.\r\n\r\nMy aim to use fonts that
  work well together, and ideally anyone who is reading the thesis (and is not a typophile)
  won't even notice my clever selection of font, only subconsciously acknowledging
  the easy legibility and harmony (and flow) of the text and headings. The headings
  should not overpower the following text.\r\n\r\nThe copy will be in 12px with line
  spacing 1.25 to 1.75, headings around 30px, 21px, and 15px. There are no guidelines
  on what fonts to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo these fonts work well in these sizes on long
  documents in academic (management studies) context, based on your experience/ deep
  knowledge? Any suggestions for alternatives? Or should I stick with Arial and Times
  New Roman and get my hat?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answers!\r\n\r\nMike"

    commended for avoiding them. (Adobe?) Jenson may be a little antique for some
    tastes, but if your subject calls for it, it's a classic and no one can deny its
    readability. So what is your subject?"

    maths or technical science, all qualitative social science theory :p\r\n\r\nkentlew,
    sorry to confuse you =) The units refer to the finished printed/ MS Word/ PDF
    A4 document. I probably mixed the units up and it should be pt instead of px?\r\n\r\nI
    am still deciding which editor to use for the final document (300+ pages A4, with
    lots of references, some illustrations and tables etc.). At the moment I'm using
    MS Word. LaTeX, OpenOffice Writer, or even HTML/CSS are some alternatives I'm
    thinking about.\r\n\r\nI hate MS Word (a pain with long documents), OpenOffice
    Writer isn't much better, and I don't really want to learn LaTeX. I know a LOT
    of CSS.\r\n\r\nWhen I publish it (if ever) online, then I'd set the units in em's
    (and use boring web fonts until @font-face is widely implemented).\r\n\r\nMike"

    all qualitative social science theory :p</cite>\r\n\r\nI suppose free advice is
    worth about what you spend on it, but I would not use Jenson for a dissertation
    on \"strategic management,\" unless your final conclusion is that management is
    a fine art.\r\n\r\nFrom Myfonts.com <cite>Jenson arrived in Venice around 1467,
    printing and publishing there from 1470 to 1480. His types, based on the upright
    calligraphic styles of the time, are regarded as among the very best of the Renaissance,
    indeed of all time.</cite>\r\n\r\nPretty good summation. While Adobe Jenson has
    perhaps been regularized, it still calls to mind the Italian Renaissance, an unusual
    allusion for *management theory.* Minion is an obvious choice for text; if you
    want to be different, I'd look at Cycles (text) and Arepo (display) from the Stone
    Type foundry, or something in the same vein from any of the other designers."
