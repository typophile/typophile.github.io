  designs like the following examples:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.iographica.com]]  or \r\n[[http://www.26lettres.com/matterNYE_hi.jpg]]
  \ or\r\n[[http://www.theluxuryofprotest.com]]  (go to the Data Visualization section...
  check out the projects)  or\r\n[[http://www.aisleone.net/2009/design/research-rca-exhibition-catalogue]]\r\n\r\nThanks!

  body: "If you aren't afraid of (or familiar with) Python, take a look at <a href=\"http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Gallery\">NodeBox</a>.
    It's open source and, AFAIK, currently available for OS X and Linux (though the
    new <a href=\"http://beta.nodebox.net/\">Beta</a> seems to have a Windows port
    too).\r\n\r\nIt takes some time to get familiar with, but there's already a huge
    host of NodeBox visualization libraries around.\r\n\r\n<em>Edit: Sorry, didn't
    see you don't like programming :) \u2026 I'm afraid for maximal control (read:
    good results) you'll want some coding skills though. It's not hard to learn, and
    there are great tutorials for both Processing and NodeBox. Worth your time. Promise.</em>"
