  body: "There is an entire forum here dedicated to identifying types \u2014\_the
    Type ID Board. \r\nFont ID requests tend to get overlooked or ignored in the personal
    blog section.\r\n\r\nYou would do best to post your requests there: http://typophile.com/typeid\r\n\r\nYou
    might also consider breaking these into separate threads, or combining them into
    smaller groups, in order to get more focused responses.\r\n\r\n"
