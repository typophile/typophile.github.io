    Pro]] Bold, with the A and R having a little surgery to remove a bit of the existing
    letters. The overall shape seems to match pretty well.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You nailed it, it s the exact font, the A and R are actually lower cases.\r\n\r\nThe
    old free Bitsumishi is also usable, the font was stretched horizontaly + 162%
    for that logo .\r\n\r\nSecond line (BIOSYSTEMS) seems to be Helvetica LT Std Roman
    with tracking at +600 and horizontal stretch similar to the bitsumishi (Which
    show that Helvetica is really everywhere....)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\nps: i
    was able to pretty much replicate the logo thanks to bowfinpw \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Artic

    things to it :) )\r\nBottom replica "
