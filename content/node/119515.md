  thinks this is Lydian. Obviously no. This looks new, and I wonder if it is a new
  typeface or something custom and unavailable? Thanks for taking a look!"

    3. In cutting marionette heads in wood I came up against the problem of projecting
    the face of a girl \u2013 so that the doll would really look like a girl of 18
    \u2013 subtly modelled features, delicate, springlike, young \u2013 to the people
    in the back row. (Aged folk like us are easy to carve, and project) I started
    by making delicately modelled heads. [Exhibit A] These were charming at arm\u2019s
    length, but the girl quality did not carry to the back benches. Then I made a
    discovery. Instead of soft curves for the cheeks, etc., I cut flat planes with
    sharp edges. [Exhibit B] These sharp-cut planes, when viewed on the stage, by
    some magic transformed themselves into delicately rounded curves and subtle modellings;
    and the faces looked like young girls from clear across the room, as well as from
    the front benches.\r\n\r\nThe Experimental Type Designs of William Addison Dwiggins\r\n---end
