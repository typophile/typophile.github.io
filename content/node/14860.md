  it and sending it to the client for corrections. I've learned that there are a number
  of things that you can fix in you clients document before you import it into InDesign.
  Let say I receive a MSwords document, I will search for double spaces, unecessary
  paragraph breaks, spaces before final points, comas, interogation and exclamation
  marks, simple ligatures, etc. Once the text is in InDesign I check on the special
  ligatures, Euro and other money signs, small caps, bold, etc.\r\n\r\nI am interested
  to know how different people go about this job. Do you follow the same guide? I
  hope not otherwise this will be one of those pointless self-indulgent forum prose.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    it works wonders.  <a href=\"http://www.unmarked.com/textsoap/\" target=\"_blank\">TextSoap</a>

    save MS Word files as ASCII text, to remove any evil RTF markup that may be lurking
    therein.

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nTextSoap looks promising. Could save me a lot of time.\r\nI work
    in a design office where I often finish off work started by other designers. Since
    some of them don't always save the text in ASCII, I end up rewriting all the E-mail
    addresses in InDesign because they are all framed in a blue box (I guess evil
    RTF markup). Is there an easy way to get rid of that blue box around E-mails?
    Playing with paragraph styles was unfruitful so far."

    is simple: Open word, Open Indesign, Open notepad (or mac equiv.) copy all from
    word and past into notepad. Copy all from notepad and past into Indesign. Its
    a fairly common pratice. I reallly easy way to remove all of the RTF formatting.\r\n\r\n"
