  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello one and all.</p>
<p>I am sort of new here. I have posted a couple of times and never really introduced myself. My name is Joseph and Im a typoholic. I am a graphic designer from NYC, and have loved letters most of my life. Even in grade school my only A on my report card was in penmenship. It hasn&rsquo;t been untill recentley have I really focused my attention into the development of type, and have started to try and develop my own fonts. I started out drawing letters were they were always trying to be different, but not different were I would be actually breaking the rules, but by doing what I wanted without really knowing the rules. So from here I read, and I read, and I read everything I could get my hands on about type. Then I decided to start simpe, learn the rules and eventually I will be able to go back were I started. And that is what I wanted to do with this font. Right now it is only an uppercase font, and eventually I think I would like to add a small caps.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>joseph</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>B: width-difference between top and bottom parts too strong for my liking
G: the left doesn&rsquo;t feel round, as O,Q, C seem to be based on perfect circles (if that is what you want)
M needs work on the ankles, feels to fat/dark there, N too.
S: top too small compared to bottom.
U: too wide</p>
<p>2,6,9: look too constructed compared with the rest, i&rsquo;d round the joints  of the straight stroke with the circles in 6 and 9 more.
7: horizontal stroke too wide
0 (Zero) feels too wide compared to your other numerals - or try to make it more oval.</p>
<p>All in my humble opinion of course.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you everyone for your comments. I am going to work on it and hopefully have something up this weekend.</p>
<p>Don, I am curious you say that the M should have a pointed vertex because it would work with the other slanted strokes. I&rsquo;m not sure what that means. Is it because my slanted strokes do not rest on the baseline like my A or K? Would you have the tops of the M pointed as well like a futura M. Just want to make sure I fully understand.</p>
<p>thanks again!</p>
