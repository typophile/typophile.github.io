  I want to get it done in letterpress, but I don\u2019t want to get caught in the
  same old traditional invitations. I have been looking over the Internet and all
  I found is generic designs.\r\nSo I have two questions for you guys:\r\n\r\n1. Can
  someone help me find a good book or website that contains ideas of what can be done
  for a wedding invitation or maybe not just wedding but over all contemporary letterpress
  design?\r\n\r\n2. I don\u2019t have much experience in letterpress jobs, does anyone
  know what kind of digital font is suitable for letterpress, any suggestions?\r\n"

  body: There is a process by which type that you set on a computer or hand-render
    can be burned on to a photopolymer plate. The plate can then be put on a letterpress
    and printed in the traditional way . . . so just about anything you can imagine,
    can be printed (really fine lines can be difficult). I would find a local press
    and sit down with them. Many people who own a press today are artists themselves
    and love a challenge.

  body: "Hi Caco. I design and print wedding invitations. I design mostly unorthodox
    shapes/sizes digitally and then have either photopolymer or metal engravings made
    from film and print them on my Vandercook SP15.\r\n\r\nGimme your email address
    and I'll get in contact ... I can send you some examples, maybe those will get
    your juices flowing.\r\n\r\nAnd when dealing with a very tactile technique like
    LP, remember: inks and paper are going to be just as important as what's on the
    page itself.\r\n\r\nAs for type: you can use almost anything you like, although
    I have a personal fondness (since I like really hard impression) for lower-contrast
    slabs and transitionals."
