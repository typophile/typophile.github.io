  body: "I dig the concept. I think as a font, it kind of useless though. Only on
    the grounds that setting more than a few words would reveal repetitions in the
    crumbled characters, destroying the illusion of natural decay. (Think about it
    like a grunge font. Don't you hate it when two \"Es\" are right next to each other
    and the grunge is the same?)\r\n\r\nAs a solution to the repetition problem, maybe
    you could do several versions of each character, maybe around 5 or more. This
    would at least help hide the fact the characters and their decay are predetermined.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with bringing these characters into the third dimension. Post them up when
    you get done."
