  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Kia ora folks.</p>
<p>I am working on a gift voucher for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elizabeth Horne<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ladies. They want somthing a bit more special than the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seasonal flyers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and what they are using at the moment is, well, terrible. So I think I have it nailed, I am just wondering whether I am on the right track.</p>
<p>All feedback will be taken into consideration!</p>
<p>Ka kite.</p>

<p>This is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nice.</p>
<p>The colours and the fades into and out of the aubergine are really neat, and the shapes that bracket the shop name at the ends of the banner are great.</p>
<p>To my eye the dotted marquee looks a bit too intense and I notice the lower right hand corner, probably because the distribution of the dots kind of jams up there and the upper-left is a bit off too.</p>
<p>The only other things is that the centre bundle/burst feels a little too stiff. I see how it derives from the vertical stripes in the other designs but for some reason it feels to me either not curved enough, or perhaps needs to be more vertical terminating in almost a  hook?</p>
<p>Out of curiosity too, I was wondering what criteria you&rsquo;re using to choose whether you use the swash R or the short-legged R? Using the swash R may add somethng &ldquo;&hellip;a bit more special than the seasonal flyers&rdquo;* maybe.</p>
<p>*These are great too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Jon! This was created in Illustrator CS, and I usually make the flyers in InDesign, because the dots are much more even for some reason. They are too intense, I am yet to match them to the others.</p>
<p>I think I see what you mean about the centre lines. I will try to soften/curve them.</p>
<p>The swash R? I use that purely when it feels right. It felt right for the summer flyer, but not the winter flyer. Don&rsquo;t ask me why! I am also cautious of over-using it, as it is integral to the original EH logotype. In this voucher, it looks odd, the words &ldquo;GIFT VOUCHER&rdquo; need to align horizontally, beacause they are in such a tight strip.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>The rest of you lurkers could leave a comment, that would be nice…</p>

<p>This seems a wise policy.</p>

<p>In paying study to this I can see you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This was created in Illustrator CS, and I usually make the flyers in InDesign, because the dots are much more even for some reason.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have always noticed this tendency on patterned lines in Illustrator which I have used since version 5.5. You may find yourself back in Indy to do the dots. The other alternative is to divide the line legth by the width of a dot and gap and then place a dot, copy it to its new position and cmd-d it across the width.</p>
<p>That is, if you&rsquo;re obsessive compulsive about that kind of thing, which I am sure you&rsquo;re not, as it would be unhealthy. &lt;grin /&gt;</p>
<p>Do show your progress, I am interested in your work.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I find the elegant shapes combined with the colour choice, type design and gradation very appealing. The dots are distracting for me, perhaps because they don&rsquo;t have the gradation, or maybe they are superfluous or too frequent or the wrong shape. I also expect to see some kind of denomination, is that too commercial for the client&rsquo;s position?

<p>Phew! Luckily I am not, and don&rsquo;t spend countless hours pondering the signifiance of dotted lines, whether the printer will get the damn colour right, adjusting the letter-spacing, asking people what they think, changing the gradient from this to that, apple- ‘s’ ing just in case, changing stroke weights from .5 to .3, and finally stressing about whether anyone cares about a damned voucher in the first place. No, not obsessive in the slightest!</p>
<p>“The dots are distracting for me…”</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that I made them too big in this instance. There is a usual size that I make them, and they aren&rsquo;t distracting at all. Rather they add a certain ‘plink’ to the final effect.</p>
<p>“I also expect to see some kind of denomination”</p>
<p>I know what you mean. But the ladies tend to write the amount on it, which  will be on the back (as yet undesigned), as they don&rsquo;t write out too many vouchers in a year. But Having said this, I may ask them whether they would consider creating a range of denominations…</p>
