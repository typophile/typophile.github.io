body: "Hi Folks, \r\n\r\nSomeone sent me this logo for a swim team, wanting to know
  what font was used. It seems familiar to me, but I searched all over and have had
  no luck pinning it down. It has a retro feel, but I don't know how far back we are
  going - Art Nouveau? Deco? Arts & Crafts?\r\n\r\nIt's doubly frustrating, because
  it looks so familiar that I think I may have this font, but I can't think where
  to look.\r\n\r\nHelp.\r\n\r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAKOSlogo_5093.gif]"

  body: Given the uneven nature of the letters, I'm not convinced that it's a real
    typeface. However, if it is, I'd look into German Expressionism as the likely
    time/place...

  body: "Thanks Nick. I still have a very strong idea that this is a font I have seen
    before. I checked German (and/or) Expressionism and found something vaguely similar,
    but without the uneven weight. To me there seems to be a design style here, not
    just crude lettering, and given what it was used for, I'd not expect it to be
    custom work.\r\n\r\nAnybody other ideas?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "In desperation I looked at Dafont in the Retro category and found <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/broken-poster.font?fpp=50&text=makos\">Broken
    Poster</a> which is based on the work of Frank Atkinson. The resemblance is too
    much to be a coincidence, even though the 'makos' lettering seems to have been
    re-styled to make it less jagged.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone else made another font
    based on this lettering, but at least this could be a starting point for them.\r\n\r\n-
