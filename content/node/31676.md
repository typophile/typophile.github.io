body: "<em>02-24-07 So now it's been determined this is Hindi</em>\r\n\r\nSo this
  is the first time I've been asked to do design work in Arabic. This is to be inlaid
  in mother of pearl on the ebony fingerboard at the first fret position. I'm told
  this translates to \"beloved.\" The final size is rather small, an area about 1.5\"
  x 1.0\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JL_inlay_4671.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm looking for is font suggestions to start off the design, and once I've got it
  adapted for shell cutting, I'd appreciate a review to make sure I don't wind up
  chaging the meaning or making something that isn't even a word. \r\n\r\nA while
  back I received some great advice for another <a href=\"http://www.alembic.com/info/fc_kay.html\">inlay
  project</a>, which I really appreciated. \r\n"

  body: "The reason is that I am not familiar with these calligraphic forms, I have
    no experience with Arabic calligraphy. I also anticipate more requests once this
    work is finished. \r\n\r\nA guitar is a very personal object. The person we build
    it for will be touching it to express their emotions, and some of our customers
    decide that they want an embellishment of a personal nature. In this case, the
    guitar is devoted to his beloved son."

    if this was Arabic. It is not Arabic or Farsi. We think it might be Hindi or Urdu.

      in india i was fascinated by the font variations in a language i can barely
      read (hindi, which is based on sanskrit).\r\n\r\nthere are peculiar curves to
      some of the letters which distinguish them from very similar ones, sort of like
      our:   i and j   or:   a and d."
