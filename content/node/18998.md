    Once I get moved into my apartment today I'll hop on this exercise. Nice woodtype-esque
    example you've got there, with a perfect 'Yeehaw' intro to boot!

    I love how your terminals start as balls and then as weight is added they just
    can't be ballsy enough without turning into slabs!\r\n\r\nI'm afraid mine was
    kind of a hip-shot. I wanted to try an S that was really narrow, and get a huge
    dynamic range out of it. I bet it looks like something already out there:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dg01four-esses.png]"

    I would almost expect the bolder weights' terminals to bend slightly inside \xE0
    la Bureau Grotesque. Nice! I think the tops could all be a tad bit smaller than
    the bottoms. Also, in the bolder weights, try putting more mass in the spine,
    less in the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nLunyboy: That Illustrator brush can teach you

    give the Ss a lot of character. I wish it carried over to the two bolder weights,

    of the ultrablack. It's straight interpolation via fontlab. Need  to tweek the
    ends to make the middle look better. Its interesting how it goes from being a
    workable text font, and in the last step goes to bubble letter display. I wonder
    if other letters could be interpolated from light to bubble like this. Probably
    not.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ssssss.gif]"

    was a one-trick pony. It's not exactly right, but it's not terrible either. The
    middle was a first attempt. The bottom is after tweeking the ultra master. The
    mid-weights are still not right and I prefer the ultra version in the middle,
    but it's a decent start.\r\n\r\nIf I was going to turn this into a font, I'd probably
    make the masters the light and black. Then do the doublestuff version on it's
    own. Too much of a stretch to use the same nodes as the light. Fun to push the
    limit though.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ssssss2.gif]"
