		<div class="commentbody">I don't know if my schedule will actually allow attendance, but I will be in Berlin May 20-24 and I was told that I'd have a pass for entry. Will Star Wars debut in Berlin at the same time as the US? When I was there last year, it appears that they were slightly behind on the films. If they debut it, I'd love to go see it.

Anyways I'd be happy to meet up in the evening with anyone who'd care to get together.

		<div class="commentbody">The big films are timed to coincide with US releases. The German Star Wars premiere will be on May 17th (that's right, the 17th) in Berlin. On the 18th (when I arrive), it would be showing on limited screens. On the 19th, I suspect that there won't be a movie theater that is not showing it. The "official" German release date is on May 19th, just like the "official" US release date.

So you will be in Berlin from the 20th? During the conference, I'll be in the Linotype stand for the duration (stop by and pick up our new brochures!). On the evening of the 21st, I'll probably attend FontShop's closing party. But I'm game for anything on the 20th. I could see Star Wars then for (perhaps) the <i>third</i> time!

Dan, I would love to but haven't got the money. Maybe you could later on share your impressions with us.</div>

Like last year, several other students from my school will be at the conference. Unlike last year, I'll be working in the Linotype stand instead of attending the lectures, so I won't be in the best position to write a good summary of the conference myself. But TypeOff is rebuilding its website, and we'll get an article up about the conference on it somehow.
