    this at their Sudtipos site. This browser sucks at the Veer site where they may
    have some other fonts shown.\r\n\r\nI am going to search Part 8 of the Script
    Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "That's a good question, because there are no repeated letters. If you look
    at Malbeck and its Alternates shown <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg10.html\">here</a>,
    you'll see why I think this looks like the work of Paul & Koziupa.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it was lettering done by one of them?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "That was by far the closest resemblance I saw in the Script Guide. I also
    went through the entire Script section of the new 'Big Yellow' (which unfortunately
    does not include any of their works).\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess I would still say
    one or both of them did this lettering/font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The source is vector art. I'm not certain its a font. I believe it is a font
    and not hand lettering because the letters are individual shapes. I'm guessing
    though as I don't know who originally created it.

  body: "I have just been looking at the word 'Bowderaking' set in most of the script
    styles at Veer, and Rob Leuschke's scripts at MyFonts.  Nothing matches, but I
    still think the Paul/Koziupa fonts are by far the most similar of the ones I have
    looked at.\r\n\r\nAlejandro Paul is sometimes a participant here. I will try contacting
    him to see if he can help with this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I regret to call off the hunt but I am starting to think this was hand made.
    The sample was from a source I would have thought would not have the budget for
    hand-drawn lettering but its possible they re-purposed it from something else.
    So, I think it is hand drawn and not a font. Who wants to make this font for me?
    We could call it: Tartine-Malbeck.\r\n"
