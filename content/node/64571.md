body: "Greater Albion has just posted design concept illustrations for two forthcoming
  releases on their [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\nAdantine is a display
  face in late Victorian decorative style, gently oblique and with a sense of refined
  movement, all capitals of a single height but with subtle distinctions between the
  \u2018upper\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 case glyphs.  It offers an air of delicate
  distinction combined with legibility.\r\n\r\nCorvone takes us to the heady days
  of the 30s and the heights of Art deco.   It\u2019s heavy, forceful and clear and
  yet has a subtle sense of fun.  It lets you shout loudly in a refined sort of way!\r\n\r\n"
