body: "Hi. I'm sure someone has already asked about this, but the search function
  is not working for me. \r\n\r\nI need to know the typefaces used in Wallpaper* mag
  for a university project I have. The inital assumption was that it is Meta of some
  variety, but I've noticed the lowercase gs in Wallpaper have a closed loop but in
  Meta they are open. \r\n\r\nI am stuck, WhatTheFont was no help either. Any help
  would be appreciated! If anyone knows the serif face used as well, that would be
  awesome. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNicole"
