body: "Anyone can tell me <em>why</em> the diaeresis/tr\xE9ma/umlaut in the lower-case
  <strong>\xEF</strong> most of the time sits lower than the dot in the <strong>i</strong>?
  This puzzles many designers of Cyrillic typefaces. The thing is that in Ukrainian
  the combination of the <strong>\u0456</strong> and the <strong>\u0457</strong> is
  quite common (e.g., <em>\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0456\u0457</em>, 'of the
  history'). The doubling of the <strong>\u0457</strong> is not unusual either (e.g.,
  <em>\u0457\u0457</em>, 'her/hers'). Any help would be much appreciated."

  body: "It's not the umlaut which is sitting lower, but the i-dot which is sitting
    higher. No pun. In most typefaces the umlaut is in line with other accents. \r\nThe
    i-dot may sit higher for aesthetic reasons, but I am not sure if this is a must.
    (I think Mr Gaultney raises the issue in his essay on diacritic design, and following
    it I have tried to drop the i-dot a bit but found the result unpleasing. At least
    in German, the combination of i and umlaut-letter doesn't occur often -- if at
    all.)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "I can think of two possible reasons:\r\n1) Since the tittle spans further
    left, it collides with the \"f\" more [often], so bringing it down helps.\r\n2)
    Unless one makes the dots much smaller (which would cause a disturbance similar
    to the one caused by the height mismatch you mention/imply) they combine to have
    too much more presence than the single dot on the \"i\", so bringing them down
    makes them stand out less (see below).\r\n\r\n> The i-dot may sit higher for aesthetic
    reasons\r\n\r\nOr a functional one: since the dot is the main thing the \"i\"\r\ncan
    contribute to readability, making it more prominent helps.\r\nI've done that (as
    well as make it slightly \"too big\") in Patria.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I am of the school that says the diaeresis should always sit at the same
    height as the dot on the i, along with the dot on \u010B \u0117 \u0121 \u017C
    \u022F \u1E41 \u1E45 \u1E57 \u1E61 \u1E69\r\n\r\nOf course, this presumes that
    the dot on the i isn't in the stratosphere. For a language like English, of course,
    the dot on the i can be virtually any height, since there are almost no accent
    marks to be concerned with. But as soon as you have a language with a rich diacritical
    set you want the height of the dot on the i to be constrained to a reasonable
    height. In a typically proportioned text face, I usually align the top of the
    dot somewhere close to the cap height.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hicii.png]"

  body: If I recall correctly, Adobe revised the diaeresis height in all their fonts
    based on user feedback from several European countries. In all recent Adobe fonts,
    the dots align as I have shown above.

  body: I concur with Mr Hudson, and I also align my dot and diaeresis/dieresis/umlaut
    accents. One of the oddest dot location things I have ever seen is in the text
    face used in The New Yorker, where the dots on the i and j are at slightly different
    heights. Looks very odd in a word like "Nijinsky".

  body: "I usually make my dieresis dots a bit smaller than the i dot, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1.
    So that, compared with other accents, it (the dieresis) is not too heavy -- it
    has to have \"single accent\" weight, and not look like two 'i' dots.\r\n\r\n2.
    Because of the f, as Hrant says, but also because of ascenders that may follow,
    such as b, h, k and l.\r\n\r\nI line them up along the bottom, with the i dot.\r\nI
    sometimes vary the width betwen the dots, depending on the width of the character.\r\nA
    lot of little \"cheats\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dies.jpg]"

  body: "Seems that my i-dot placement is a bit narrow minded, and some design decisions
    turn out to be national peculiarities which get evened out as character sets grow.
    Approaching diacritics a more systematic way is one consequence. Also the peculiar
    Czech caron comes to mind, or \xC4 \xD6 \xDC with dropped umlaut (in German typefaces)
    which are just out of place in larger character sets.\r\nAs regards your design
    samples, it is interesting that versals and ascenders are comparably small which
    doesn't leave much choice for placing accents.\r\n\r\n\"The doubling of the \u0457
    is not unusual either (e.g., \u0457\u0457, \u2018her/hers\u2019).\"\r\n\r\nThis

    necessarily even -- it seems that the more demanding languages are paid more attention
    in the mega-language font; for instance, when some languages have proponents who
    are quite adamant about having steep acute accents, and others traditionally have
    a flatter angle, and no strong voice arguing for that in the type design community,
    then the steeper accent will predominate.\r\n\r\n"
