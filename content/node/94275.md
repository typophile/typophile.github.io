  body: "I'd be careful about trying to hard to duplicate the weight and forms of
    your symbol. Could dilute the impact and create a bit of a thud. \r\n\r\nThere's
    [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100020 | Requium,]]
    which echoes the shapes but would partner the simplicity of your shapes with some
    elegance.\r\n\r\nOr you could go with a type face that more subtly echoes rather
    than reflects the forms. Something like a Janson Text or Founders Caslon. You'd
    get the flexed shapes of your form in the serifs of the without a complete duplication. "

    than the shapes and it came out perfect.
