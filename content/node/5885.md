body: I am currently workingon an identity for a company called Ready... Set... Dinner!
  &#40;exclamation theirs - I&#39;m not quite THAT excited&#41;. They recently changed
  their name from Ready For Dinner - &#40;what a stretch&#41;. Anyway - for background
  - they are one of those places where you go and prepare like 12 entrees at a time
  &#40;they do all the shopping, prep work and clean up&#41; and you take home the
  12 entrees to freeze and then pop in the oven - Since you made it yourself you know
  its fresh, &#34;homemade&#34;, and adjusdted to your personal tastes &#40;for an
  additional fee you can pay them to assemble the meal&#41;. Anyway - it is a new
  concept  to our area &#40;Louisvilla&#41; and the owners already are ready to franchise
  into Chicago and a couple of other cities around here. I have attached their original
  logo and my first few drafts - let me know what you think. A couple of the elements
  &#40;such as the chef hat in 2 or 3 of them&#41; were requested regardless of cliche
  &#40;but oddly enough among their competitors its about the only &#34;food&#34;
  symbol that hasn&#39;t been used. <BR> <BR>The logos should be upbeat - the branding
  style will be coming along - already a couple of her competitors have latched onto
  A&#41; the Williams Sonoma look or B&#41; the kitchy 1950&#39;s I Love Lucy look
  - we will probably be avoiding those just for differentiation - so we are going
  for a more laid back look. They asked that I not focus on Ready...Set...Go as rushing
  or hurrying so clocks and speed were not part of the concepting <BR> <BR>Let me
  know what you think - A couple of them I am not sure about type arrangement in relation
  to logo and I am not sold on all of these fonts, but Its been in our office - but
  not in my worklog - &#40;hmmm how nice is that&#41; for a pretty long time &#40;about
  3 weeks&#41; and the customer is aching to see proofs - so I will probably go with
  these for now, but would like some objective eyes on ways to tweak them in the next
  month or so... <BR> <BR> <BR>1&#41; Here is the original logo &#40;only about 2
  years old - I&#39;m not sure who did this one&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; Trying for a
  kind of swooshy &#34;Panera Bread&#34; kinda thing - not really sure I like it <BR>
  <BR>3&#41; This one would go with the tag line &#34;Meals like Magic&#34; It really
  is a leftover idea I had when we were batting around the name Abracadinner! But
  we liked the concept so here it is... <BR> <BR>4&#41; This one is really a take
  on their original logo - keeping the chef hat, but bringing it a little more current
  in style. This one reminds me of a mayonase label... <BR> <BR>5&#41; I think I like
  this one best - clean and elegant more my style, but maybe too WilliamsSonoma. However
  - the client did tell me her favorite magazine is Real Simple - so... It my fly...
  Any ideas on how to make the icon in the middle more obviously a switch to set an
  oven without going overboard? <BR> <BR>6&#41; The customer asked for one that says
  Ta-Daa! I&#39;m not really big on that concept but this is pretty close to what
  I sketched in my book - didn&#39;t flesh it out cause I think it won&#39;t make
  it past round one &#40;shame on me&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks guys for any input....

  body: 'I like #5 also. It would look great on the side of a vehicle. <BR> <BR>Before
    I read your explanation, I thought the icon was a timer &#40;the word set could
    go either way, timer or oven knob&#41;. Maybe you could try using the negative
    space to create a slim white vertical line above the knob &#40;showing the off
    position&#41;, then the knob &#40;which I think usually turns to the left&#41;
    would look like it was rotated from a set position, rather than a ticking timer.
    <BR> <BR>Have you tried a version where the icons are at angles. I realize it
    isn&#39;t as &#34;Real Simple&#34;, but it might be worth exploring. Right now
    they look a little rigid, but the curves of the colored boxes is a good contrast.

    it might help if it was pointing at a temperature that was a little closer to
    where one would bake - in the other version it would be barely defrosting. Is
    that important or do you think the directional aspect of having the arrow help
    guide the eye through the logo outweighs that? Also - I didn&#39;t put a space
    after the elipse which though its wrong gramatically they felt it kept it together
    as one company name better so we&#39;re trying it on both ways, not sure where

    the two you just posted will be changed, either with meals like magic or with

  body: maybe the order of the icons should follow the order of the words in the name
    with something like groceries in the first box, a timer or oven knob in the middle
    and the steaming meal in the last block. just an idea. as one who actually does
    cook &#40;and i&#39;m assuming this company is catering to an audience that has
    some knowledge of how to use an oven&#41; i get the knob, esp mark&#39;s version
    with the ticks. but maybe it&#39;s cuz i&#39;ve been exposed to this thread and
    i like the icon, makes it hard for me to have a totally objective eye. <BR>&#40;or
    maybe even the empty place setting could go in the middle box... like set the

  body: 'The real target market is soccer moms and the icons in number five are following
    the process. Mix it up &#40;used the blue for that one because it is the stage
    where it is frozen&#41;, then cooking with the oven dial &#40;warm orangy color
    for cooking&#41; and then dinner - plate and fork - they want to really focus
    on getting the family back to the table - hence the place setting versus a steaming
    covered platter. <BR> <BR>They want to show that the experience is hassle free
    - you don&#39;t have to shop, you don&#39;t have to prep, you don&#39;t have to
    clean - you just show up, mix the stuff up to your taste, take it home &#40;frozen
    of course&#41;, bake it and serve. We found that showing any kind of representation
    of the taking the food home connotated delivery so we&#39;ve kept the cars, wheels,
    bags, etc. out we also found that indicating anything about freezing visually
    made people think more of tv dinners which this is trying to get away from.. <BR>
    <BR>There also needs to be a sense of levity that cooking dinner doens&#39;t have
    to be a chore, but can be a rewarding experience one with a good deal of satisfaction.
    <BR> <BR>paul - originally I did have the plate in the middle with a table in
    the far right  &#40;or a smile with a yum-yum tongue&#41; for that exact reason
    &#34;set the table&#34;, but the two became redundant and nothing was showing
    the rest of the steps well. So set the table became set the temperature or set
    the oven and voila thats what we have. So the icons are Ready - get the dish ready
    by mixing the ingredients, Set - Set your oven at home and put it in, Dinner -
    enjoy the meal. And the concern over the oven knob is one that I already have
    - even with the tic marks does it still not get across the idea of setting an
    oven? Not necessarily a literal translation, but just the idea. <BR> <BR>Dan -
    Sorry - I was asking about the retro type - were you just referring to the type
    in #2 &amp; 3? What I call the  I Love Lucy look? I&#39;m not altogether sure
    about that font myself - especially with two big competitors doing the 50&#39;s
    kitch thing. <BR> <BR>Now the owners of the place that I work are both soccer
    moms - they are &#34;everyone&#39;s demographic&#34; - young, upper midclass,
    drive SUV&#39;s, very attractive, stylish, career oriented , the whole nine yards
    - and they &#34;got it&#34; &#40;they weren&#39;t in on the concepting, but they
    do know what the company does&#41;. <BR> <BR>There is also the question of differentation
    - since these ladies will be franchising this across multiple cities &#40;louisville,
    chicago, maybe stlouis&#41; in the midwest - it needs to be differentated well
    from the competition which have used things such as, steaming dishes of food,
    dinner bells, a single plate, 1950&#39;s kitch, etc. Oddly enough - the chef&#39;s
    hat is the only clic'

  body: 'Hugh -  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the detailed explanation about the co. . . <BR>
    <BR>I think everyone might be commenting on #5 because it is by far the most successful
    logo. Although the timer may not be instantly recognizable, IMO all of the images
    you are using in the &#34;boxes&#34; work well. I am not sure about the font,
    I would like to see you try some other choices; you also might want to think more
    about the color . . . I &#34;like&#34; the colors and I like the concept behind
    them but something to keep in mind is that blue is the &#34;least appetizing color&#34;
    &#40;it seems that might be a bit magnified when used in combination with that
    shade of green&#41; --  i would say the overall feel of the colors do not represent
    food/dinner/appetizing. They do, however, communicate the aspect you mentioned
    about dinner not being a chore . . . <BR> <BR>About #3: <BR>I am just not sure
    about this one . . . reminds me of the television show Bewitched. Perhaps with
    a different font the overall logo would work better, i am not sure. I agree with
    Scott, just the spoon makes me think of soup. <BR> <BR>#4: <BR>This one is the
    weakest of the three IMO -- it looks very generic. Not crazy about the font .
    . . overall, this one just looks cartoonish, childlike. <BR> <BR>I personally
    thought the icon of #2 worked well &#40;the next best after #5&#41;, perhaps you
    could try combining the feel of the icon of #2 with the concept of #4.'

    as fast food, but convenience food thats quality. What I think you could work
    on is the type and the colors. The one everyone is responding to comes across

    tonight or over the weekend. It is the 3 icon idea and the box concept &#40;the
    one that looks like a jar label&#41;  <BR> <BR>Customer requests were to pump
    up the color a little on the 3 icon and she needs to see the tweaked oven dial
    - she&#39;s not sure she&#39;s sold on that being the middle one - she thought
    like I did and one other poster here that the plate could be in the middle and
    some sort of food at the end - I told her it felt a little redundant and she kinda
    understood that, but I may still need to show here a proof. <BR>She liked the
    typeface &#40;futura&#41; but wasn&#39;t sure about all lower case - I told here
    it made it feel infinitely less formal and accentuated the circular shapes that
    are echoed in the icons. I may still have to show her - I may also play with a
    similar font, but I really want absolute circulars to keep it open as well as
    echo the circles in the logo. Scott: the Chalet was an excellent suggestion I
    love that font as well! Might add a little more flavor while keeping it in the
    same feel or possibly kabel or avant garde I just need to look at them <BR> <BR>After
    seeing the concepts - her partner recalled seeing another logo similar to this
    on another sight &#40;untrademarked&#41; - it had been pretty poorly done, they
    felt, so they hadn&#39;t listed it with their competitors that I should look up
    - therefore - how suprised was I to find something similar to his already out
    there. The other logo is not focused on the process as this one is and is rather
    more &#34;homemade&#34; looking. They aren&#39;t sure if the logo will be franchised
    or not, but from the look of the site - it is probably a regional only company.
    The owners of teh company didn&#39;t seem too uncomfortable with the situation
    - they weren&#39;t sure it would be a problem, but I don&#39;t know if that is
    just because they want to be done with the process or if they really don&#39;t
    feel competitive with this other group. Our account rep for them feels like ours
    is different enough that we should go with it - and I do feel that with branding
    and style we will be differentiated enough that there won&#39;t be confusion which
    is the goal - but there is that &#34;pride and plagerism&#34; and honor among
    theives thing that I don&#39;t want to be ripping off someone else&#39;s logo.
    What are everyones thoughts about that? <BR> <BR>On the second one  they like
    it because of its similarity to their old logo and that it is different than any
    other one.  <BR>I am going to also play with fonts. Scott - I hear what you are
    saying about the smooth rough contrast, but a really want a fun feel to this one
    with type that almost feels like its part of a salad being tossed or ingredients
    being mixed - think Muppets&#39; sweedish chef - but I may be off base there -
    gonna try spumoni and maybe a few others - I may hate them - any suggestions for
    something that will have a similar fun feel but may be a little more streamlined?  also
    the colors will definitely change on this she felt it was a little too old feeling
    for her so we will try it in some brighter colors. Their colors historically have
    been blue and orange and they really would like to stay there - already have the
    floor and walls done in those colors and are building a second one with those
    specs - we had the conversation about a fesh coat of paint being a heck of a lot
    easier than trying to force colors that may not work for your branding down people&#39;s
    throats and she relented, but wants to at least give it a try. <BR> <BR>So - there
    we are - going to work on those two concepts tonight and over the weekend. Thanks
    for all the help so far.'
