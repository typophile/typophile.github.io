body: "I'm considering a Brandon G./Arial combination for a project I am working on.
  It works for [[http://www.spacex.com/]]. However, I'm not quite convinced about
  Arial (which has been reinforced by this [[http://typophile.com/node/119103]] interesting
  discussion). \r\n\r\nWhat I think works pro-Arial is that the font is so neutral
  that the Brandon headlines are empahised, but that's about it.\r\n\r\nFor some specific
  parts of text I'm using Brandon as well, but the major part will be another font.
  I've considered a Google workhorse like Open Sans or Source Sans Pro, but as they
  are less \"clean\" than Arial, the contrast with the headlines is somewhat softened.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
