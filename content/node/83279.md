body: "I was trying to compile the different weights of my typeface and I ran into
  a strange error. The Regular weight compiled without issue (as did the Regular Italic).
  However, the Semibold and the Bold ran into \"[FATAL] Stack underflow\".\r\n\r\nWhat
  is strange is that all of the class information and Opentype feature information
  is exactly the same across all of the weights.\r\n\r\nWhy would it compile fine
  in the regular weight but not in the Bold or Semibold?\r\n\r\nThank you very much
  for your help!"

    I try to compile my font as an OTF, at 91% of the way through the process, Fontlab
    crashes.  Any ideas as to why?"

    is painstaking, you have to progressively delete glyphs, compiling each time,
    to find the bad glyph at which point the process is crashing.\r\nThen, replace
    that glyph with fresh paths."

    on the first try ever again.\r\n\r\nNow I'm back to the stack underflow problem."
