  body: I went for the basic set, open type. I'd have loved to go for the full set
    but figured all those different weights of thin would be less useful for what
    I do and it was really a lot of money.

    I started back in 2006</a> and part-inspired by Patty's card. It's rather weak
    but there you go, I put something together in the spirit of the season.\r\n\r\nBest
