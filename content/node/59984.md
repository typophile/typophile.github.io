  design, and it would therefore be great to have some critique/feedback from other
  typeface designers.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of the characters are inspired by Norwegian
  national costumes, and Norwegian 'rose paintings', and the main purpose of the typeface
  is for use within the Norwegian written language.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fonttest_6378.jpg]"

    v\xE6rt spennende \xE5 se som en displayskrift. \r\n\r\nDet er et par ting du
    burde ta tak i her, f\xF8r du g\xE5r videre: \r\n\u2022 Bredde \u2013 \u2018s'
    \u2018t' og til en viss grad \u2018a'  virker smale, \u2018r' \u2018v' \u2018w'
    \u2018x' \u2018y' virker litt brede. (N\xE5r du tegner \u2018r' er det veldig
    smart \xE5 l\xF8srive seg mer fra \u2018n'-kurven. Den burde v\xE6re litt brattere,
    slik at du unng\xE5r et stort hvitt \"hull\" nede til h\xF8yre. Det kan v\xE6re
    smart \xE5 dra den h\xF8yre seriffen litt ut ogs\xE5.)\r\n\u2022 Avslutningene
    p\xE5 \u2018f' og \u2018j' stjeler veldig mye oppmerksomhet.\r\n\r\nLykke til!
    Gleder meg til \xE5 f\xF8lge dette videre."

    \xE5 se hvilke former som er for brede eller smale. Man blir fort litt blind for

    the effect, one should see it actually printed with ink on paper...\r\nAlso, since
    <cite>the main purpose of the typeface is for use within the Norwegian written
    language</cite>, it would be good to see some Norwegian text set with it instead
    of some lipsum. So to better judge the colour, for example."

  body: "I found the \"v\" \"x\" \"y\" and \"z\" to be a little wide.\r\nThe uppercase
    S is a little narrow. Try to redraw it make it more similar to the C.\r\nThe G
    and the M are also a little narrow in my opinion.\r\n\r\nUpon close inspection
    the thicks and thins in the capitals don't seem consistent but overall they look
    nice. However I'm worried about the arms on the T and E I'm afraid they'll look
    too thin in small point size.\r\n\r\nI don't know the whole thing looks cool I
    love the \"C\" \"c\" \"g\" and \"r\" as drawings. I also liked the comma and the
    dots on the i and j a lot.\r\n\r\nGood works show us better capitals next time."

  body: 'The stencilly breaks are interesting (remind me of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/auriol/auriol/|Auriol]]).
    Will they show at text sizes, though? Is there a consistent "rule" for their appearance
    (e.g. why on ''w'' but not ''W'')? '

  body: "It's very pretty. I like the cultural background and how you integrate it
    into the type design! What I wonder is if this prettiness will come out, and work,
    at \"body copy\" sizes. Things like the tail of the \"Q\": I can see that looking
    smashing in a headline, but will (like Craig said) the gaps even come out at small
    sizes, and then what will they *do*? Will they look distracting (adding a bit
    of \"white noise\"), or will they help the glyph? Will they maybe \u2013 in this
    case \u2013 make the \"Q\" more confusable with the \"O\"?\r\nThe way I understand
    things (and I'm a rather new type designer, so take with a grain of salt), text
    face design is not just about making glyphs look beautiful up close &ndash; it's
    also very much about functionality. So if you're really wanting to target text
    sizes, prepare to do a *lot* of testing at your target point sizes; and you might
    have to sacrifice some solutions that look good up close if they don't work at
    small sizes :-/ \u2013 something that doesn't have to happen nearly so much to
    display/titling fonts, which enjoy much more \"creative freedom\"."

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for all the comments! They are all
    helpful, and I now know what to do next.\r\n\r\njohnnydib: thank you for your
    opinion on proportions of the characters. I will do some adjustments on these.\r\n\r\neliason:
    the reason why the 'w' is 'broken' but not the 'W', is that in the lower case
    the lines cross each other, while in the upper case the lines 'just meet'. I guess
    this means that maybe the 'Y' and the 'G' shouldn't have break(?) I also tried
    to set the 'T' with a break, but didn't think this looked good at all. Have tried
    a lot of different options with the breaks, but am having a hard time in making
    up my mind on which ones I like and which ones I don't like.\r\n\r\naltaira: I
    have done testings in a lot of sizes, and I try to have a high focus on the small
    sizes. The gaps works down to 8pt size. Of course they do not come off as 'hugh
    gaps' at this size, but one can still see the impression they give on each character. "
