    Script]], shown in this Bitstream version. A number of other upright scripts are
    based on this style, including ITC Redondo.\r\n\r\nOf course, 1895 is a bit pre-digital,
    so you may not find an exact revival.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Don't have my Jaspert, Berry & Johnston with me right now to help out, but
    the script's character is reminiscent of the rondes, from which there are a few
    to choose. French Script and Redonda are in character. Have you looked at Gando?
    It's an older design, perhaps the caps are not as swashy as your sample.

  body: "I ended up using Solotype's Arcade (not Penny Arcade), Dawson, and Mural
    for the second set of fonts. It's quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\nStill not what to
    do about the ronde font. The problem is that it has to be upright because it's
    mirrored on the text, and right-slanting script becomes very illegible if mirrored
    and not upright.\r\n\r\nMichael Everson\r\nevertype.com"
