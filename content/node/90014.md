  by Aesthetic Apparatus. Link to original below.\r\nhttp://aestheticapparatus.com/detail.php?uid=C6C3BC&subsection=Posters&status=yes\r\n\r\nAnyone
  recognize this guy? I can't seem to find anything like it.  Could it be a modified
  Akzidenz or Univers, or something similar?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Any
  suggestions would be most helpful. I'm stumped.\r\nZack [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KILLS_6566.png]"
