  Trajan, but I need them to be really thick all around. It\u2019s for a product called
  \u201CTITAN Condoms\u201D, and I need a logotype that really pushes the notion of
  size. Normally I would just draw the letters, but I\u2019m pretty busy right now
  so just buying a display face seems likely."

    Titling Bold</a> is way too light, isn\u2019t?\r\nWhat about <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grouch/\">Grouch</a>?
