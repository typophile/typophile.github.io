body: "Hi all, this is my first post here.\r\n\r\nI'm quite a newbie on font creation.
  I always wanted to create a font, but only recently I got the chance. I am trying
  to make a font to match my company's logo, so that I can use it in its corporate
  identity (I didn't use a font for the logo, the characters are crafted \"by hand\",
  so it was a great opportunity to finally design a font of my own, based on the logo's
  characters).\r\n\r\nI have designed all the glyphs in Illustrator CS3, I inserted
  them in FontLab after reading lots of tutorials on the matter, and then exported
  the font in .otf format. \r\nThe otf format looked terrible on small sizes on screen
  (I'm using Windows Vista, if has anything to do with it), so I tried TrueType (.ttf).
  That looked much better, but in sizes less than 12pt, the characters look like they
  have different heights (and they don't!). In print the font looks very nice, and
  in sizes more than 12pt, it looks nice on the screen as well.\r\nAny ideas about
  that? I read something about hinting here, but I'm not sure its related to the issue
  I'm having. \r\n\r\nAnother issue: I added some ligatures and they work fine in
  applications like Notepad or MS Word (strangely enough, judging by the issues that
  I read other people have with MS Word). However, when I type a text with that font
  in Illustrator CS3 and that text contains a ligature, I get the message \"Can't
  finish previewing. There is not enough memory\" and I can't switch to the normal
  preview until I delete the part of the text that contains the ligature. Any ideas
  about that?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for any english mistakes,
  its not my native language.\r\n"

    on this matter in English. I don't know if you have seen it yet. \r\n\r\nMy guess
    is that you have not made your font align and snap to a grid in Illustrator that
    is compatible with FontLab. If you don't do that your glyphs will be distorted
    when you copy it over bacause FontLab will snap every node to it's grid.\r\n\r\nThe
    article is here: http://font.is/?p=48\r\n\r\nGood luck."

  body: "Thanks for your reply siguram. :)\r\n\r\nI probably didn't express the problem
    clearly enough, sorry for that.\r\n<strong>The issue is present ONLY in the screen
    and ONLY in small sizes (below 12pt).\r\nIn print (at any size) or in large sizes
    on screen it displays fine.</strong>\r\nAlso I have taken care of the alignment
    and the glyphs were not distorted as I copied them at a really large size (I read
    in a tutorial that the bigger the size of the glyph in AI, the less the distortion
    at FontLab and it actually worked)\r\nSo its probably not an alignment or distortion
    issue. Its something else I have no idea about (like hinting for instance, or
    some setting I guess)"

  body: "If things are not aligning vertically at lower resolution, the usual cause
    is missing or incorrect alignment zones. These are horizontal regions placed (usually)
    near the baseline, cap height, x-height, ascender height and descender height
    (negative, below the baseline). Typically, the zones should enclose any points
    above or below these places that should align at low resolution. For example,
    if you have an alignment zone near the baseline, any points that are off the baseline
    but inside the alignment zone will \"snap\" to the baseline at lower resolutions.
    An alignment zone works sort of like the \"snap to\" distance in drawing programs.\r\n\r\nYou
    can create alignment zones manually or have FontLab create them for you (using
    the little green gem icon button) in the Font Info dialog box under Hinting Settings."

  body: Strange. It looks like it should work (although I haven't had any experience
    with Greek, so I have no clue about the last question). Not necessarily relevant,
    but I find it odd that you have a ff and ffi ligature, but not a fi ligature.

  body: "@Mark: I'm planning to create an fi ligature as well. In general, I plan
    to add lots more ligatures when I solve the other issues I have with the font,
    as I love them :P\r\n\r\nBy the way, the Illustrator ligature problem was present
    before I added the greek ligature, so its not because of it.\r\n\r\n@k.l.: Whoa
    that looked quite confusing but I'll study it in more depth when I find more time,
    it seems helpful. Thanks.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I tried to add alignment zones, I
    even made the one at the x-height very loose (602-650 when my font's x-height
    is 626) but it doesn't seem to work at all :( \r\nAlso, I tried to define a standard
    stem for hinting (as my font only consists of 1 stem width) but I still get issues
    with some thicker stems in small characters (I guess that's because the standard
    stem setting is for Type 1 and not TT? Is there something similar for TT?). However
    the alignment zones issue is more important, as the stem width problem occurs
    only on a small amount of glyphs, so I could solve it with manually hinting them
    I guess.\r\nThis issue is driving me nuts :'(\r\n\r\nThank you all again, I would
    be desperate if I hadn't found this forum. :)"

    think I had been setting Type 1 zones instead of TT zones previously, and this
    is probably why they didn't work.\r\n\r\nAlso, the AI ligature problem is mysteriously
    solved, so it probably was a one-time thing. :D\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd share
    my happiness with you :D\r\n\r\nI have lots of problems to resolve still (stem
    widths, unicode ligatures) but these were the most annoying ones and they are
    finally SOOOOLVED! :D"
