body: "I am trying to replicate what a hastily scribbled note on the back of the business
  card would look like, if it were written some time between 1880 and 1910 by a well-educated
  German. It isn't meant to be legible, but needs to look fairly authentic.\r\n\r\nNow,
  my knowledge of German is limited to the prase \"H\xE4nde Hoch\", and what little
  reaserch I managed, is based on conjecture and automatic translations. Anyway, from
  what I could find, it seems that I need to use a version of the script that came
  before the spread of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin|S\xFCtterlin]]
  which became popular after 1915. I've compiled a short sampling of handwritten notes
  from before that period, and tried to combine them with some letters from the [[http://www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productID=8|Kurrent
  Kupferstich]] font to get enough variation in repeating glyphs.\r\n\r\nHere's what
  I got. Am I completely off the mark?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/German_6166.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  German text is supposed to read:\r\nWo: Der Narrenturm, Operationssaal\r\nWann:
  12. Januar, 9:30 Uhr\r\nOhne Flei\xDF kein Preis.\r\n"

    the \u2018broken\u2019 script that was used in Germany until it got banned, together
    with Fraktur and the other \u2018broken\u2019 typefaces, in the 1940s. [See here:
    Wikipedia on <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Kurrentschrift\">Deutsche
    Kurrentschrift</a>]. It still can be seen now and then in old people\u2019s handwriting.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, S\xFCtterlin is a reformed version of it; upright, with a larger x-height.\r\n\r\nSome
    remarks: The \u2018N\u2019 in Narrenturm looks like \u2018St\u2019.\r\nAnd: you
    left out the word Operationssaal.\r\nThe \u2018n\u2019 in Januar seems to be missing.\r\nYou
    wrote \u2018Fleis\u2019, not \u2018Flei\xDF\u2019. The latter would be the correct
    spelling \u2013 then again, German orthography was not that consistent before
    Konrad Duden (he published his first dictionary in 1880).\r\nYou wrote a \u2018long
    s\u2019 (\u017F) at the end of Preis: This is wrong, at the end of words, there
    has to be a \u2018round s\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe typical writing instrument of Kurrentschrift
    would be a pointed pen.\r\nF\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Yes, that\u2019s better! ;-)\r\n(Though the connections aren\u2019t very
    smooth, but I think you are aware of that \u2013 e.g. P_r in Preis, Fl_e in Flei\xDF,
    \u2026)\r\nThere should be a dot after the 12.\r\n\r\nWhat the <em>hell</em> is
    this for? A faked paper chase in Vienna? I\u2019m really curious.\r\n(And if it\u2019s
    in Vienna, written by an Austrian, then it should/might be J\xE4nner instead of
    Januar.)\r\n\r\nAs for the paper size: I have no idea. Standardization came a
    lot later, so I don\u2019t think this is really an important point. "

  body: "Heh, yeah I know about the connections, thats the next thing on the list
    of things to fix. \r\n\r\nWhat is this for...err...it's a little difficult to
    explain.\r\nBasically, it's just a personal project. I am designing various paraphenalia
    to accompany a really short story, that I've written in the style of 19 century
    Russian plays (including the orthography though that still needs work)So far,
    I have an ExLibris, a business card of a German doctor working in Viennese Krankenhaus,
    a photocopy of a catalog page, a postcard of the estate, and annotated scraps
    of the pages missing from the book. There is no real point to any of this, just
    idle play in the spare time between the boring in-house jobs. Still, I want to
    make sure this looks and feels and authentic.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, I
    can attach some of the items in their current half-baked state.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

    Germany (but Austrian), then it should be very definitely J\xE4nner instead of
    Januar. (Actually, back then, also Feber instead of Februar still used sometimes,
    but more seldom, while J\xE4nner is  even today used exclusively)."
