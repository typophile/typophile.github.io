  van Blokland (1967) studied Graphic and Typographic Design at the Royal Academy
  for Fine and Applied Arts in The Hague, Holland. Erik started to collaborate with
  [[Just van Rossum]] under the name [[LettError]] in Berlin, while working at MetaDesign.
  After experimenting with computer programming in connection to type design, they
  came up with [[Beowolf]], the first typeface with a mind of its own. It was released
  by [[FontShop]] in July, 1990. The radical approach of Beowolf caused a lot of publicity
  for LeTterRor, and of course fame and fortune. Well, fame anyway. After stints at
  several places in the world, including David Berlow\u2019s [[Font Bureau]], van
  Blokland settled in The Hague as an independent designer, working together separately
  with van Rossum. Their work now includes type design, illustration, magazines, corporate
  design, interactive design, animation, music, and websites. And lectures."
