  body: On what platform do you work, Sita? MS Windows or MacOS? <BR> <BR>OpenType
    is bound to become the new standard and it&#39;s cross-platform,  <BR>so you can&#39;t
    lose. Unfortunately QuarkXPress still doesn&#39;t support them, <BR>so that could
    be a problem. They work perfectly with Adobe software. <BR> <BR>The typefaces
    that come with your Adobe applications are licensed  <BR>for any work, including
    commercial, but that license is limited to the  <BR>computer the software is installed
    on &#40;and probably some output  <BR>device&#41;. So basically you can&#39;t
    install them on any other computer than  <BR>the one the software they are bundled
    with is installed on. <BR>You should be able to find more details about the extent
    of the license  <BR>in the documentation that comes with the software package&#40;s&#41;.

  body: Yves, <BR>Being a recent graduate faced with purchasing several fonts this
    year, this issue is one that I have been wondering about. I&#39;m on a Mac, use
    Quark, and have read about the problems with Open Type, so have opted to purchase
    either True Type or PS fonts -- never really knowing why I&#39;m choosing one
    over the other -- but I think I&#39;ve read PS fonts will go the way of the dinosaurs,
    so True Type is the better choice - correct? <BR> <BR>However, I hate the idea
    of investing so much money in either format if Open Type is going to take over.
    Does that mean I&#39;ll eventually have to repurchase the fonts I&#39;ve spent
    so much on this year?  Just yesterday I purchase Sparrowhawk on Veer for $39 &#40;!&#41;
    and it only offered one format &#40;it didn&#39;t say which one it is&#41; - BUT
    it doesn&#39;t work in the Microsoft Office  Entourage program &#40;trying to
    create a logo for an email signature&#41;, so I&#39;m either feeling a bit cheated
    -- OR I just need to tweak something somewhere to get it to work &#40;probably
    the later but the constant detective work of what needs tweaking is soooo time
    consuming!&#41;  <BR> <BR>How should I think about font formats in order to make
    the best long term investment? Thanks!

  body: Darrel , Iv never tried indesign before. Iv been working in quark for years.
    I think i would be alittle scared to start using another layout application since
    iv never even touched indesign before. Is it easy to use?

  body: Service bureau would be the people who take your files and output film - may
    be the print shop in your case. If as part of your production process you need
    to give them fonts &#40;license permitting&#41; as well as Photoshop and Illustrator
    files then you should ask them what they prefer.  <BR> <BR>With respect to Donna&#39;s
    question - the OpenType fonts will likely contain goodies and extras accessible
    in Adobe apps and eventually Quark. If you don&#39;t need or want the extras there&#39;s
    no need to upgrade. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Apparently, Quark 7 will come out later this year, and support the full range
    of OpenType features. So you can continue to work in the page layout program you&#39;re
    comfortable with, and not miss out on special OpenType features.  <BR> <BR>The
    legacy font formats of PostScript Type 1 and TrueType will continue to work for
    many, many years to come. <BR> <BR>So you can feel comfortable buying any format
    you like. <BR> <BR>Of course, like any software, fonts can have bugs; and in that,
    no format or foundry is immune.

  body: 'Before OpenType fonts became available, for print work I preferred working
    with Type 1 PostScript fonts rather than TrueType... They were more reliable than
    most of the TT fonts I was familiar with. <BR> <BR>Briefly, the differences are
    that PostScript fonts have two components: a suitcase containing the screen fonts
    and separate files for the printer fonts, while TT fonts combine these into one
    scalable font file... Also, PostScript fonts use the same page-description technology
    as laser printers. <BR> <BR>As for OpenType, it is a cross-platform format, meaning
    you can use the same font file on a Macintosh or Windows machine. OpenType fonts
    have room for many more characters than the older font formats.'

  body: I use open type whenever possible. <BR> <BR>I personally have never ran into
    problems with them, but as some have said above, there are circumstances where
    they might have issues. <BR> <BR>r.k <BR> <BR>ps- don&#39;t be afraid of InDesign,
    it is simple, smart, and powerful. You could pick it up quickly if you wanted
    to.

  body: 'The dividing line between Windows TrueType fonts and OpenType is remarkably
    thin. <BR> <BR>Personally, I use about 80-90% OpenType fonts, and the remainder
    almost all TrueType. I keep a few Type 1 fonts around for specific compatibility
    needs. <BR> <BR>But then again, that&#39;s predictable: I work for Adobe &#40;inventors
    of Type 1, and co-developers of OpenType&#41;, and we stopped making new Type
    1 fonts in 1999, to switch to OpenType. <BR> <BR>We will likely stop selling Type
    1 fonts this year, but that&#39;s another story, which I will cover in more depth
    at various type conferences later this year. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: I don&#39;t let the format decide the purchase. However, if a typeface is
    available in both Opentype and PS&#42; 99% of the time I will get the OT version.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; I am of the opinion that if a person licenses the OT version that
    the foundry should also be willing to give the person a PS version and not charge
    extra.
