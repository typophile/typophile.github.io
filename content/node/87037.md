  there are plenty of InDy users here on these forums.\r\n\r\nI receive PDFs of adverts
  that others have created in InDesign, for inclusion in <em>black-and-white</em>
  publications. I have the full version of Acrobat, so I can run some preflight checks
  before sending the files on, but I don't have any other Creative Suite apps so I
  can't do heavy-duty editing of the PDFs, nor can I work on the source files.\r\n\r\nTwo
  necessary features of what the PDFs <em>should</em> be, are (a) pure greyscale -
  so no CMYK-format objects floating around even if they are nominally black, and
  (b) all trnasparencies flattened.\r\n\r\nMy problem is, some of our designers don't
  seem to be able to fulfil BOTH these criteria. Often we'll get a file that's suitably
  greyscale (so it passes the preflight checks for \"List non B/W objects\" and \"Document
  generates more than one plate\" etc) but with un-flattened transparencies. But if
  I run Acrobat's transparency flattener, or get the designers to flatten the transparencies
  at source, things mysteriously change colour space, and we'll end up with CMYK drop
  shadows and so on.\r\n\r\nRemember, I don't have/use InDesign. What I'm after is
  a (simple!) description that I can pass on to the designers, to say \"you need to
  do <em>this</em>\" so that the PDFs they output will be right.\r\n\r\nOut of frustration,
  they're resorting to outputting as tiffs instead of PDFs, which works, but makes
  the files much bigger than they need to be, so I don't want to encourage that.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help?"

    keeping you from converting the PDFs to TIFFs, thereby allowing <em>you</em> to
    control the color space?"

  body: "Nothing, but again that'd bloat the file size. \r\n\r\n...and part of the
    reason we're trying to keep the file size down is that often we're putting two
    or three of these ads into a set of PDF revises for a publication that is otherwise
    mostly text (and therefore a relatively small file) and email them out to external
    editors for checking. It's just adding extra levels of procedures, that I think
    we <em>should</em> be able to do without if we can get the files output suitably
    in the first place. (Plus I have six colleauges who are doing the same job as
    me, but who <em>don't</em> even have the full version of Acrobat, so any re-saving
    has to keep coming through me!) :^/ "

  body: Which version of Acrobat is that, James? I'm using 7.0 Professional, and there's
    no "Print Production" section under the "Advanced" menus. There is under the "Tools"
    menu, but the "Preflight" window that I can launch from there only enables you
    to make various checks, not actual changes.

  body: Maybe you could try exporting it as a grayscale EPS from Acrobat? That would
    make it black-only and do the flattening at the same time. This ought to work
    if EPS is compatible with your workflow and the files don't contain anything else
    that EPS doesn't support.

    Pro for Mac.  I'm thinking these options have been available for several versions
    (perhaps under a different menu), but I'm not sure. There's a Profiles tab that's
    selected by default in that window; you might want to see if there is a Profiles
    menu item somewhere.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acrobat_4025.jpg]"

  body: "From these replies, I think I need to ask our IT department if they have
    newer versions they could upgrade me to (and if I'm allowed!) ... in an ideal
    world I'd get the whole Creative Suite so I could edit elements of PDFs out in
    Photoshop and then place them back, but I think that might be pushing my luck.
    \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'll look into the procedures suggested by the users
    on that Adobe forum, and also David's (archaica) suggestion and see if those get
    me anywhere. That Adobe discussion does seem to support the case for upgrading!\r\n\r\nETA:
    Pretty sure my version 7.0 doesn't have anything resembling that 'Profiles' panel,
    James.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, these are still post-hoc fixes to the PDF from
    my end. Back to the original question - does anyone know if the designers could
    be doing anything differently in InDesign for the PDFs to output with all the
    required attributes in the first place?"

  body: "I do the Acrobat \"convert to grayscale\" quite a bit. Not straight forward
    but some clients insist on creating everything in Microsoft office. I much prefer
    to handle PDF than DOC\r\n\r\nAlso if you want more control over the tonal reduction,
    you can open the PDF in Illustrator and do \"Recolor Art\". A very slow process,
    though.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried this but converting the profile to a dot-gain (grayscale)
    one might also do the trick. I have been meaning to try that next."

    equivalent - as this version doesn't seem to have the \"blending modes\" option)
    works, in the sense of making a pure greyscale file that'd pass the preflight
    tests, but mangles some logos on the page.\r\n\r\nI have a workaround that involves
    just re-printing the PDF to a new PDF withan output setting of \"Compsite gray\",
    which also works but tends to lighten some blacks to grey. As a short-term stopgap,
    this I can live with.\r\n\r\nMy manager has asked our IT dept about chances of
    getting my Acrobat upgraded to v8 or 9. We'll see what happens."
