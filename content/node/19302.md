body: "The thread about the stressless zero got me thinking of the wee little zero
  on the (American) Lincoln cent. Then when I checked the reverse of this coin (pre-1959,
  aka \"wheat\" cent), I noticed the arts-and-crafts style of \"United States of America.\"
  Which leads me to ask if people could suggest some good resources specifically on
  typography and coins. I'm particularly interested in machine-age and forward, but
  anything could be interesting. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/98_1_b.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/26_1.jpg]"

  body: As far as I can tell the relationship between print typography and stamping
    (coins, medallions) has never been adequately explored. Though it would likely
    reveal a great deal. Especially, pre-Machine Age. Or specifically, the initial
    development of Western typography. It may have been a social/cultural thing, but
    repeatible images were practiced for stamping in ancient times; it just never
    seemed to have successfully caught on for print media until the mid 15th century.

    Gutenberg's father was a noble, but he was not, so I don't think he could have
    ever risen to whatever position his father might have had. But some scholars believe
    that young Gutenberg may have worked producing Mainz's coinage before leaving
    the city for Strasbourg. The lettering on coins were struck with punches, just
    like the punches Gutenberg would later develop in order to produce the matrices
    he would later need to found metal type! They speculate that had Gutenberg not
    had this knowledge, he never would have invented his printing method. Of course,
    there is a large dose of speculation here, because none of Gutenberg's punches
    or matrices or even type have survived, just the finished products he sold\u2026
    the books."

  body: "Dan\r\n\r\nGutenberg was associated with the guild but he was never a member.
    The assumption that he worked in this capacity is tenuous. That punching was established
    is clear. The trick though was not merely punching but to set up a system that
    would allow for a mechanical method of setting that would yield a printed page
    as good as or better than the written page produced by a scribe or copyist. I
    suspect Gutenberg worked out the mechanics of it but more likely Schoffer, a trained
    copyist, worked out the typography.\r\n\r\nBut by the way.... Gutenberg never
    sold the books. The contract for producing \"the work of the books\" (the Bible)
    was annulled (the Helmasperger Instrument). Fust sold and reaped the profits.
    Gutenberg got paid for supplies and equipment furnished and asked for nothing
    further."
