    of them were the exact equivalent of Helvetica, as I could test at the time by
    pairing them on a page. Unfortunately, this was 11 years ago and the CD Rom is
    long gone in my many archive boxes, as well as the name of the font. But the point
    is, I disagree with you, there is a right choice. You simply didn't find it.\r\n\r\ndr"

    closely, but it is not an exact match. There is no legitimate font that matches\r\n100%.
    Pretty much all the best designers here in Tokyo use either Midashi Go MB31 or
    Gothic MB101.\r\n\r\nIf there exists a perfect match then somebody has just made
    the swap for you,\r\nreplacing the roman characters of the Japanese font with
    Helvetica. I don\u2019t know\r\nthat I would trust someone else to make that swap
    for me.\r\n\r\nThere are not that many well drawn Japanese fonts to choose from,
    I would guess\r\nbecause of the sheer amount of characters that have to be included
    in a complete\r\nfont. I think I have included most of the really well made ones
    in the comparison,\r\nbut if you find out the name of the font you used before
    then I would love to know.\r\n"

  body: "I've given much thought to the issue of matching hangul (Korean alphabet)
    typefaces with Latin ones, and I have a fairly good idea of what style of hangul
    sans-serifs would go with grotesks such as Helvetica. But it's impossible to set
    up exact parallels between the styles of two writing systems that developed separately.
    I think you would run into the same issue when you look for a Japanese match for
    Helvetica.\r\n\r\nA Japanese match would have to be a monolinear sans-serif, with
    attributes like openness of the letterforms, squareness, smoothness or abruptness
    of curves, relative counter size etc. somewhat comparable to Helvetica. But since
    the structures of Japanese and Latin letterforms are so different, this is not
    an exact science.\r\n\r\nThe Latin glyphs included in the Japanese font can be
    a guide to what Latin designs would match the Japanese glyphs, but don't rely
    too much on them. Typically, the Japanese glyphs would be designed first and then
    the designers would look through their catalogue of Latin typefaces to pick one
    that they decide is a good match. Then they will base the design of the Latin
    glyphs on that model, modifying the proportions and weight to match the Japanese
    glyphs as needed. There are exceptions such as Axis, of course, but this is why
    the Latin glyphs in Japanese Gothic typefaces are mostly derivatives of Helvetica,
    Frutiger, and other well-known Latin sans-serifs.\r\n\r\nAre there subgenres within
    Japanese Gothic typefaces to which Helvetica is better suited than other subgenres?
    Quite possibly; I don't know enough about Japanese typefaces. But I think just
    because the font designer chose a Frutiger derivative for the Latin glyphs doesn't
    necessarily mean that Helvetica wouldn't work just as well.\r\n\r\nIn the end,
    I suspect all the typefaces mentioned in the post are generally stylistic compatible
    with Helvetica. In this case, consideration of proportion and stroke weight trumps
    all else, including what style of Latin glyphs the designers included in the Japanese
    font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
