    the O could use some overshoot, and the J is a little light."

    do you think?\r\n\r\nsorted out the J too. the O does have overshoots (im concerned
    about them being too big! :) - it must have been the small sample I posted[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JACO_6122.PNG]\r\n\r\nhere

  body: 'There''s something about th /S/ maybe it''s just the way it''s rendering
    on my iPad but it''s a bit uncomfortable, it just doesn''t look smooth to me.
    I would keep working on the /G/ and take elisions advice because right now I think
    it is the weakest link in the chain. '

  body: "On your straight lines you seem to have a reasonable balance between horizontal
    and vertical thicknesses, but maybe you haven't carried that over to round shapes
    like the \"O\"? The vertical parts need to be thicker than the horizontal parts
    there as well, to look visually similar.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: The X and Y seem a bit light, and I don't know if that's just my eyes, but
    it almost looks like the bottom-left to top-right leg of the X doesn't cross the
    other leg in one straight line. It also looks, visually to me at least, like the
    top of the C overhangs the bottom. And the O is still looking a bit heavy to me.

  body: "Too many cooks . . . the first version you showed was on the right track.
    The proportions were strange but that's what was cool about it. Keep whittling
    it down and you'll end up with a Gotham clone. Pointers are pointers but don't
    let a bunch of people design it for you or it'll lose all its personality. I've
    watched a lot of fonts get spoiled or amlost spoiled by committee on Typophile.
    Everyone here has their own idea of what looks good but if you average it all
    together it's just a gray mass.\r\n\r\nDon't let beziers design your S for you
    or you'll end up with a generic S. Try making a an S only using straight lines.
    Spend an hour moving those points around and testing in words. When you're comfortable
    with it, then works on beziers on another layer. About half the time I spend on
    an alphabet is on the S and X . . . tough letters."
