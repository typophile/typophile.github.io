<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Okay, we've all seen this behavior, where a line in a large point <br>size has much more space in front of it than lines set in smaller <br>sizes. Is there a good reason why fonts should do this? Why is <br>there any space left before characters on a line? <br> <br>Look how difficult it is to get a nice alignment here. (These <br>screenshots are from Illustrator, but the same thing happens in <br>InDesign and Quark.) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52280.gif alt> <br> <br>A) I know that type designers consider the space before and <br>after characters when they setup kerning metrics, but is there a <br>way to avoid this? What is it about the way fonts are built that <br>leaves this unwanted behavior? <br> <br>B) Are there fonts that exist that don't have this problem? And <br>does the spacing in these fonts (if they exist) create other <br>problems because of it?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>When I designed JFP's type specimen I accidentally on purpose made it very alignment exact. I ended up using the line indentation a lot. You might also try a left indent. Maybe?</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is a question of spacing, not kerning. The left margin includes the left sidebearing of the glyph in question. In InDesign and Illustrator, you can get around this to some degree by choosing optical margin alignment. If the font had OpenType optical bounds info, and an application used that, it could also help. <br> <br>However, there isn't a reasonable way around this in terms of the actual spacing of the font. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Left sidebearings are important for good spacing. Sorry. :-/ <br>Fonts that don't have this "problem" are simply not well spaced. <br>And of course the larger the point size the larger a sidebearing comes out. <br> <br>But I see where you're coming from, and I can think of one way of addressing it, although it's peculiar: a font can have an invisible dummy character, and kerning pairs for every single combination of it and another character, where the pair value "removes" the left sidebearing. It's not as bad as it sounds, actually - in fact I guess you could even do it with Quark's pair-adding facility or something, although you'd first have to open the font and record all the left sidebearings (and you still have to account for overshoots, like you want the "O" to be pulled back more than its "raw" sidebearing, otherwise it won't align visually). <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>I forgot to finish, in case it's not clear: <br>You would then insert the invisible dummy character at the beginning of each line, and there you go! <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Heh, it gets even better: <br>Pay somebody (hint, hint) to write a Python macro that adds the invisible dummy character and all its kerning pairs to an existing font, and saves out a new AFM file (all you'd need to replace) in seconds. You could even write a Quark (or whatever) macro to replace linebreaks with linebreak+invisibledummyaligner so you don't strain your fingers. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>fonts that don't have this problem are not spaced correctly</i> <br> <br>I know there are good reasons for this problem to exist, just <br>wondering how others work around it. <br> <br>It looks like Indy's optical margin alignment only gets you part <br>way there... I noticed that with some fonts it makes no noticable <br>change and with others it helps more. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52286.gif alt> <br> <br> <br>Tiff, could you describe your method more thouroughly? Do you <br>setup paragraph style sheets with negative indent settings? Do <br>you use the text frame "inset" settings?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Indy's thing is making it worse [in that case]. <br> <br>Tiff's "method" sounds like the ancient Gallic practice of L'Eyeballin... <br> <br>> If I were ... dealing with a handful of fonts or faces <br> <br>By "handful" you mean too little or too few? <br> <br>It's the ol' scalability/overhead deal, where brute forcing can indeed make sense sometimes, but: <br>- If there are a small number of fonts you do this with a lot, it's worth manually building the kerning, once for each face; <br>- If there are a large number of fonts you do this with sometimes, then the Python automation makes sense. <br> <br>Are you sure you're in the middle ground? <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>If it's just for the headline/subhead combo I normally modify the spacing in type>story>optical margin alignment -also like when dealing with hanging punctuation- and save it as one of my styles. <br> <br>This is just indy, of course.</div>
