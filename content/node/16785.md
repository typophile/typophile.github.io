    This is for my senior project. \r\n\r\nI rather arbitrarily said...\" hey, basing
    my proportions on goudy old style should be fine!\" Wrong. I was reading Lawsons
    \ Anatomy the other night, and it said GOS had only been used to set one book
    between 1924 and 74, something like that. So, I'm basically modelling my type
    on something thats not really a good text face. That said, my h and p pretty much
    are the same width as my model. \r\n\r\nalso, my ascenders are taller than my
    model.\r\n\r\nBut that could change, I've just been trying to get that stupid
    curve right forever. If you feel it would work better slightly thinner...or, I
    could thicken up the thins, that might make it at least look smaller.\r\n\r\nThe
    lc x being top heavy...I see it now.  Dont know what you mean on the k. The g,
    deff. needs work.\r\n\r\nExplain 'floppy...looking for a home\" on the k.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The k arm looks limp.  This can work in a casual cursive to some degree but
    in a structured roman in does not sit well with the rest. It usually involves
    the negative space ballancing the black.  It is hard for me to describe since
    it is such anincremental visual decision.  Perhaps it needs to be more constructed
    in a manner keeping with the other curves in your alphabet?\r\n\r\n\"That said,

  body: I think that the type is too light for text. Are you using a small optical
    cut for your reference? Maybe that would explain why the original was so hardly
    used.

  body: "\"if a make the rounded characters less wide and heavier, I assume thats
    going to happen to everything else?\"\r\n\r\nThe heavier part is true. You don't
    want the thin lines to be too weak for text sizes. The narrower part is not really
    the same. The reason I said some of the characters were too wide was that they
    \"appeared\" wider than the rest. In your sample above, you may have narrowed
    the b too much. Balancing widths of glyphs is a subtle shift of incremental adjustments
    to make the proportions appear to balance each-other.  It is very hard to see
    this at large sizes. I think you need to create a usable test font with a minimal
    character set to be able to test it out.  You will also see how fitting letters
    to their neighbors affects the glyph design and you may have to revisit your outlines
    to compensate.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    a good text face.\r\n\r\nYou can pick up a copy of just about any English-language
    magazine from the 1920s and find ads with body copy set in Goudy Old Style. It
    was considered a top-notch face in its day. Not as ubiquitous as Kennerley, but
    a classier development in the same vein. \r\n\r\nEric, you're just tinkering with
    Goudy's design, and don't have a clear design principle, other than \"basing my
    design on...\" You need to find a reason of its own for your typeface to exist,
    in a hurry.\r\n\r\nAs you have gone too far to abandon the project, and as what
    you're doing is cosmetic, I would recommend comparing your face with a letterpress-printed
    sample of GOS (not individual vectored glyphs), and basing your re-styling ideas
    on that. \r\n\r\nStop looking at the letters so big and in isolation: this typeface
    is all about fit, and the changes you are making to it, such as squaring off the
    bottom right serif of the L and E, work against the face's inherent fitting strategy.
    OK, if you are going to dismiss Goudy's snug fit and asymmetric serifs, and produce
    a chunkier setting with more discrete characters, then you should be testing settings
    of character-pair combinations, to see how you fitting scheme compares with the
    original.\r\n\r\nLet's see a text setting now; get that right and the glyphs will
    take care of themselves."

    \r\n\r\nHere's the question. I thought, since I drew all of these from the ground
    up, simply basing proportions on a face, I never really thought of it as an interpretation,nor
    did I want that. I guess thats not the ideal way to handle this.\r\n\r\nHow would
    you go about it, making in not purely cosmetic? "

    new letters based on the proportions of old letters really isn't design\u2026
    Wouldn't you want to \"design\" something for your senior project? Your senior
    project isn't just a chance to show that you know how to use illustrator or FontLab
    or whatever, but rather to show what sort of designer you can be when you work
    independently.\r\n\r\nYou need to set a target audience and medium\u2026 and because
    this is small for a type project (at least in your fitted time range, I assume),
    you might want to limit output size as well. Really, after this point, its all
    up to you\u2026 maybe you could find some vehicle through school? i.e., new 11pt
    type for the student newspaper, new 9 point captions for the yearbook, or new
    font to be used in graphics on campus intranet websites, etc."

    you see which character combinations are not comfortable, then decide whether
    to fix the situation by varying the sidebearings, or changing a detail of the
    serif (eg width, sharpness, amount of bracket). Or vary a stem weight. Whatever
    -- the important thing is that you will be designing a typeface, not lettering
    glyphs.\r\n\r\nTry not to look at GOS, and figure out a way to make your typeface
