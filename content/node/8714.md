  body: Anybody? &#42;cries&#42; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m needing to licence a few postscripts
    from there and it&#39;s kinda hard to do that since I get a forbidden error message
    everytime I visit the site. <BR> <BR>I sent an email to the address I had stored
    but no answer as yet. Was hoping somebody here might know what was happening.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again.
