body: 'Several years ago I read Douglas Hofstadter''s essay in Metamagical Themas
  about the near impossibility of AI researchers being able to encapsulate the subtleties
  of font.  Since then, I''ve had a profound appreciation of typeface.  Unfortunately,
  I''m still a beginner in all of this.  I''m about to publish a collection of short
  stories, essays and a bit of poetry.  I would like to get opinions as to what sort
  of classic serif I should use.  Would it be advisable to use different fonts for
  each section of the book?  I''ve perused the forums and so far have found all sorts
  of stuff.  So much, in fact, that I feel it might be best to narrow my field of
  play.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.  You can find excerpts from the book
  here: http://blog.myspace.com/austinduggan   Thanks.  This site is awesome.'

  body: "<em>the subtleties of font</em>\r\n\r\nFont isn't a collective noun.\r\nThat's
    like saying \"the subtleties of guitar\".\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs you are an inexperienced
    typographer, I would suggest imitating a setting you like as being the most productive
    approach.\r\nIf you have trouble identifying the typeface used, ask at Typophile.\r\n\r\nMake
    sure that the fonts have old style figures as default, and that you are able to
    set true small caps -- and that these are large, as small caps go (i.e. noticeably
    larger than x-height), which will benefit the acronyms in your text.\r\n\r\n<em>Would
    it be advisable to use different fonts for each section of the book?</em>\r\n\r\nNo,
    because it's best to let the readers make up their own minds about what distinguishes
    the writing in the different sections, rather than coerce them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm looking at Photina MT now.  Yes, I am a bit over my head, as I don't know
    what any of the jargon means.  MT, SC... all of that stuff is Greek at the moment.  Thanks
    for your help.  I plan on using the rest of the week to figure out at least the
    basics of font designators.  Any references?  Links?

  body: "> Would it be advisable to use different fonts for each section of the book?\r\n\r\nYou
    could, but this is fraught with dangers. For instance, a subtle change in font
    might just come across as an error, or confusing to a reader. However, I can see
    the possibility of it working. I think you should have an experienced designer
    with strong typographic skills working with you if you did go that way."

  body: "<em>PC...Word</em>\r\n\r\nI repeat my recommendation about old-style figures
    as default.\r\nFor small caps, you need a separate small-caps font, not Word's
    faux effect. OpenType fonts which contain small caps are no good, as Word doesn't
    support them.\r\n\r\nThese two things--old style figures and small caps--are the
    most obvious determinants of \"quality\" typography (assuming you already have
    curly quotes happening).\r\n\r\nAlso in Word, you should turn on kerning, which
    is off by default."

  body: Well, I was using Times New Roman, which as the name suggests does not use
    old style figures.  The only font I have available and like that uses old style
    figures is Georgia.  But the capital letters look a bit too symmetrical for my
    tastes and often encroach on the lower-case letters.  I also don't particularly
    like the O.  I don't know the technical term, but I prefer the O to have a slight
    slant.

    a size 10, which looks a bit squashed as compared to Times New Roman.  My eyes
    hurt.

  body: "If you like an O that has a slight slant, that means you are looking for
    something \"oldstyle.\" Palatino, I think, might fit what you are looking for.
    It is generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of 20th Century type design,
    and is particularly well-suited to fine book typography like you are talking about.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the best thing is, you already own it. You should already have Palatino on your
    system, either under the name Linotype Palatino or \"Book Antiqua.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/URW-Palladio-L-Roman_5650.gif]\r\n\r\nBut
    that doesn't address the small-caps, oldstyle figures question, but there is a
    solution that is equally as cost-efficient.\r\n\r\nYou can get a free, and completely
    legal, small caps/old style figures version of URW Palladio, AKA Palatino, at
    the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/fpl/|Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
    (CTAN)]] in Postscript format. (Only if you're using Windows XP. Vista doesn't
    do Postscript fonts.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sc_4342.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sc2_3576.gif]\r\n\r\nIf
    you're interested and you can't get the postscript thing to work, message me off
    board and I'll email you a copy that I converted to Opentype. (Which is also legal
    due to it's license. Yay URW!)"

    for Windows XP), and WPF apps can't see \"PostScript\" (Type 1) fonts, but there
    are very few important WPF apps out there.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
