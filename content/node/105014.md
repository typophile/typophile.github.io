  exactly five rows, even where logic would seem to dictate six rows?\r\n\r\nWhy is
  this convention used even on wall calendars which clearly have space for a sixth
  row, even if this would mean decreasing space used for a \"notes\" section or pithy
  quotes or some such? Note that only a partial sixth row is ever needed. \r\n\r\nEven
  if for some reason it is forbidden to use a sixth row, why use \"23/30\" and/or
  \"24/31\", thus cramming five characters into a single cell? Why not instead use
  \"1/8\" and/or \"2/9\"?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I assume you're talking about printed calendars, as I think computer calendars
    generally have 6 rows when appropriate. At least the one I use (iCal) does.\r\n\r\nI've
    designed a few printed calendars and have always used 5 rows max because if you
    had 6 rows the top and bottom rows would be mostly blank, plus all the rows become
    smaller in height, leaving less room for people to write notes.  \r\n\r\nI've
    never had a client complain about doubling some dates, but they'll complain if
    the cells are too small.\r\n\r\nNot sure why the tradition is to double up on
    the last row (such as \"24/31\"), but I assume it's because doubling would often
    occur just on a Sunday when people probably have fewer appointments to jot down,
    plus (and maybe this is the main reason) it's less obvious than doubling on the
    top row.\r\n"

  body: "I think, Dumpling, you've answered your own question. Many, many years ago
    I was required each year to hand-set in 6-line wood letter the kind of wall calendars
    I'm sure you are referring to. We produced them for a number of local companies
    who handed them out to their customers. They were created on a seven by five grid
    and printed on a Heidelberg 10x15 platen press. A seven by six grid would, as
    you state, mean that the sixth row would be only partially used.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    these calendars didn't have note-making space, our customers liked them for the
    large numerals; six rows would have meant smaller numerals.\r\n\r\nAs to why the
    doubling is on the last week rather than the first, JamesM's explanation is a
    good as any. Also, maybe, the 1/8 solution you suggest is similar to 18 whereas
    a 23/30 (as would occur this September) is much more obvious as two dates. \r\n\r\nIt
    is, as you say yourself, the convention. It's what we're used to and so needs
    a good reason to change. I recognise that you ask where did it come from and why
    and I suspect it was simply a straightforward compromise which is now the custom
    and practice through continued use."

    1/8 you could use a fraction form! Maybe I'll try that sometime. Once I crammed
    a 1 and an 8 together (vertically) when space was tight and I thought 23/30 would
    look too mashed up.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see by your \"this September\" remark that
