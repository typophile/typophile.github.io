body: "I'm giving away a copy of Body Type 2 by Ina Saltz. It's a great collection
  of typographic tattoos. Comment on my blog to win! http://www.glennsorrentino.com/blog/view/win_a_copy_of_body_type_2/\r\n\r\n\"From
  Rimbaud to the Rolling Stones, from declarations of love and belief systems to self-empowerment
  and homage, the choice of a typographical tattoo provides insight into the human
  condition. \r\n\r\nThe sequel to the bestselling Body Type: Intimate Messages Etched
  in Flesh, this second volume collects over two hundred new tattoos and explores
  the ideas and emotions behind this indelible commitment. This stunning photography
  collection features commentary on the letterforms as well as personal recollections
  by the tattooed on the motivations for their decided words. Inspiring, sometimes
  shocking, and always voyeuristic, Body Type 2 is not only for tattoo aficionados,
  but also for all lovers of the written word.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/61Ibkch9ciL_3562._SS500_.jpg]"
