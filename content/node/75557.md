- body: "The style is called \"Slab Serif\" or Egyptian. There are several fonts with
    these characteristics. If you are a printer, your client should have the rights
    to use the font and therefore provide you with the font. If you want to have those
    copyrights yourself, you can find many <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/slab+serif+college+egyptian/fonts/\">fine
    slab serif fonts here on myfonts.com.</a>\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-slab/\">Museo
    Slab is especially gorgeous.</a> And if you really want to look hip, you can't
    beat the sleekness of <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrafaceslab/fontspecimens\">Neutraface
    Slab.</a> College kids and sports fans could really swoon over that stencil version
    of Neutraface Slab. \r\n\r\nIf your target market is women & men of all ages,
    check out <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033\">Archer
    by Hoefler & Frere-Jones.</a> Sure, it was deisnged for Martha Stewart - but that's
    why it's just so darn classy. I can see women choosing this font on a shirt for
    a gift for their man. (And, he'd actually like it!)"

  body: "Often, college-style typefaces are octagonal in construction too, so you
    could search for keywords such as \"octagonal\", \"college\", \"varsity\", and
    \"sport\".\r\nOther than the very good suggestions from Alaskan, if you\u2019re
    not particularly interested in quality, or are looking for a clumsy feel:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=104"
