    reel, but I doubt there is much that can be done about that. Maybe lightning the
    outer circle to the stroke weight of the skull and bones will help, along with
    lengthening the fan blades.\r\n\r\nMaking the ring a little larger in the biohazard
    symbol might make it read better.\r\n\r\nVery nice skull and bones. The teeth
    are going to be reduced beyond recognition at text sizes but the rest should hold
    up.\r\n\r\nI quite often see a rain cloud (cloud with slashes underneath) on the
    local weather reports instead of an umbrella. Does Unicode specify \"umbrella\"
    for that position or just \"rain\" (or are you making this set up without regard
    for established Unicode symbols)? You'll need a black cloud with a lightning bolt
    dropping from it for thunderstorms, if you don't have one already. I'll have to
    defer to people who live with snow for an opinion on the snowman vs. snowflake
    controversy.\r\n\r\nBack up to your first two rows, the planetary symbols seem
    just fine but some of the others seem a touch too light. I'm a bit rusty on which
    of those is which, though."

  body: "The unicode does <cite>seem</cite> to specify a snowman and an umbrella.
    But it just seems like a symbolic mistake, if what is intended is the meterological
    conditions \"rain\" & \"snow\". But  I am not 100% clear how they are used. Maybe
    I am grouping unlike things... \r\n\r\nMaybe I will reduce the # of teeth on the
    skull. The radiation symbol is set, as is the biohazard but I think they could
    be tweaked in the ways you suggest.\r\n\r\nThe lighter astronomical symbols are
    meant to be lighter than the main symbols but my question is \"how much is ideal?\".
    I may be sweating some of this too much but I want to make this as fine as I am
    able to."

    to include double-wide glyphs in a monospace font, but I can't remember what it
    is. Programmers probably have something to say about it, one way or the other."

  body: Nick, I see. You are right that columnar alignment would not be broken. The
    only place this would matter would be be in programmers code where using a doubled
    glyph would create an opportunity for a mis-count at a glance. 105 glyphs with
    one of these would look like 106 spaces were being taken. It is unlikely that
    a programer would use one of these glyphs to program with. But - I think when
    you use a mono you expect it to play by certain rules. When/if this ever becomes
    a regular sans Font I will make the adjustments you suggested.

    advocate: a rain cloud would be a little bit harder to distinguish from the existing
    cloud than an umbrella, and maybe a snowflake would be a little bit harder to
    distinguish from the existing sun (or an asterisk) than a snowman."
