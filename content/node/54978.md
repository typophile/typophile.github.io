  body: I think we're going to need more resolution than that. What is the source?
    Is it scanned from a book?

  body: Damn that's nice...But i'm not sure what it is either. Thought it might be
    ITC Founder's Caslon 12...the italics have a similar slant..but the Roman looks
    way off..:( But you're right..it's very very nice.
