  Gothic. The only difference is that there is a reverse angle on the tips of the
  t, p and a which I can't seem to match with anything.\r\n\r\nApologies for the lack
  of technical terms.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6497.png]"

    try modifying News Gothic to achieve the same corner points. Thanks Mark"
