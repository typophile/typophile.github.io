body: A friend of mine wants to publish a manual for his CMS software package that
  is being written in DocBook XML. I did a search here but nothing turned up.  <BR>
  <BR>Since I use LaTeX primarily, I was interested in doing it this way, but it seems
  quite complicated. ConTeXt seems to be better set up for this but I would have to
  learn a whole new language; I can&#39;t even figure out how to change fonts in this
  system. I also tried some experiments in InDesign to get it to work but that seems
  hopeless...  <BR> <BR>So does anyone have any experience with typesetting DocBook?
  Keep in mind that the manual will likely be over 400 letterpaper-sized pages. I
  would appreciate any advice you can offer.
