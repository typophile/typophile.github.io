    \r\n\r\nMy guess as to why the prime symbol is usually placed there is that most

  body: "That is correct.\r\n\r\nUnicode is a fairly recent idea, and the distinction
    it makes between characters, glyphs and code points was quite the innovation.\r\nBasically,
    it means that each linguistic character is designated a code point (an alphanumeric
    number), and may be represented by a glyph at that code point.\r\n\r\nPrevious
    encoding systems, most notably ISO 8859, encoded glyphs rather than characters,
    so were not so linguistically precise and in many instances there were conflicting
    code systems\u2014hence the need for one code to rule them all.\r\n\r\nAnd way
    before that, the idea that one piece of type (i.e. glyph) may encode several different
    characters was representative of the economic resourcefulness traditionally exercised
    by printers. In fact, prior to the introduction of hot metal equipment (Linotype)
    in the 1880s, the left quote marks were set from the same piece of type as the
    comma, merely rotated 180\xB0.\r\n\r\nMany typewriters had no \"one\" or \"zero\"
    characters, the typist being expected to make \"l\" and \"O\" do double duty.\r\n\r\nThe
    situation with the \"dumb\" quote marks stems from continuing support for older
    fonts that use the ISO encoding.\r\nSo really, it's a double-edged sword deriving
    from the longevity of fonts as software. \r\nIt may have been possible, when Unicode
    started c. 1990, for the Unicode Consortium to have moved to obsolesce the dumb
    quote encoding of ISO 8859, but it was a young organization and such a move was,
    I assume, not expedient.\r\n\r\nAnother legacy that Unicode incorporates, although
    inconsistent with its premise, is the encoding of the glyphs \"fi\" and \"fl\"
    as if they are single characters and not merely typographic ligatures.\r\n\r\nEven
    today, there are no separate Unicode points for the right quote and the apostrophe
    in the basic encodings, hence the debacle with \"smart\" layout applications abbreviating
    numbers with left quote marks. Rather pathetic, if you ask me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    then I wouldn't look dumb when students ask me \"why does the prime symbol says
    apostrophe when you hover over it in the glyphs panel?\". Oh well, now I can explain
    it to them and look even smarter! ;-)\r\n\r\n\"Another legacy that Unicode incorporates,

    not sure I understand this fully. Isn't this a good thing? Is this the reason
    I can find, let's say, \"flow\", if I'm doing a Find/Replace in InDesign? It's
    nice to be able to find the word even if it uses a ligature. Or are you just saying
    they're not consistent because they didn't do the right move for the apostrophe?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Unicode deals with the meaning of characters, not with typographic niceties.
    You can design a font with all kind of crazy ligatures (fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl,
    fff, fb, ffb, fh, ffh, fk, ffk, ct, st, sp\u2026) but you shouldn\u2019t assign
    a codepoint for all of them, only to the characters in which the ligature can
    be decomposed. Therefore, you can find the sequence \u201Cfl\u201D because it
    is composed by an \u201Cf\u201D and an \u201Cl\u201D, no matter if it is ligated
    or not.\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively new idea. Before Unicode, it was thought that
    treating ligatures as characters was harmless (and probably the only way to go).
    Now this is considered a bad practice: someone can type \uFB02 (uniFB02, as I
    did here) for the sake of having a nice ligature, so you won\u2019t be able to
    find your word because you are looking for f (uni0066) and l (uni006C)."

  body: "Yes, it's important to remember that by design, Unicode is supposed to be
    a semantic encoder, not a glyph encoder.  For 99.99% (possibly more) text documents,
    that is the preferred method.  However, for certain specialized topics, mainly
    scholarly, it is as important (or more important) to note the actual glyph changes
    more so than the underlying semantic meaning for any number of reasons.\r\n\r\nIn
    comes the private use area.  Because Unicode explicitly doesn't encode anything
    there, by using those code points, you can ensure that specialized encodings don't
    tread on the standard encodings.  In practice, the PUA is used for three things
    really:\r\n\r\n1.  encoding logos/etc. for use in text (e.g. the Apple logo)\r\n2.
    \ encoding new Unicode blocks which are still being proposed / in the process
    of being approved\r\n3.  encoding functionally, graphically, or featurally, but
    not semantically, important differences in glyphs\r\n\r\nThe second one tends
    to result in a wholesale move of the block (so, you might use four rows in your
    proposal, they'll just become four rows in a different block which makes it easier
    to convert).\r\n\r\nFor the last one, in order to make the non-standard somewhat
    standard, several different initiatives have started up, namely MUFI, UNZ1, and
    CSUR.  Those projects agree not to step on each other's areas.  Sometimes some
    of their glyphs will end up in the Unicode standard, but most of them will probably
    stay in the PUA."

    Henestrosa:\r\n<cite>Before Unicode, it was thought that treating ligatures as
    characters was harmless (and probably the only way to go).</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    before Unicode, people conceptualized printers as something you hooked up to a
    computer to print glyphs in response to codes sent from the computer. One code,
    one glyph. If fancy steps to insert ligatures in text were required, they would
    be done inside the computer - since, of course, computers are big and expensive,
    and thus printers are dumb.\r\n\r\nAnd codes like ASCII and EBCDIC are principally
    communications codes, governing things like the connection to a printer.\r\n\r\nWe've
    come a long way from then to now. Unicode indeed is eminently suitable to allowing
    documents to be interchanged between different computer systems, containing text
    in different languages, and so on. It facilitates applications, though, that were
    just about unimaginable in the world of mainframes and punched cards.\r\n\r\n@emspace:\r\nTo
    be less technical than Wikipedia:\r\n\r\nThe first 128 charcters in Unicode match
    those of an older code, ASCII.\r\n\r\nWhen ASCII was originally invented, the
    code positions used for lower-case letters were left unassigned. Thus, ASCII 39
    (') didn't look like either an apostrophe or a prime, but like the single-quote
    symbol on a typewriter - it was vertical.\r\n\r\nWhen lower-case was added to
    ASCII, some terminals left that character as it was, but others sloped the character
    so it could be either a directed quote or a prime, making a pair with the new
    reverse-quote, ASCII 96, (`), which had only just been added, along with the lower-case
    letters. (The characters { | } and ~ were also added to ASCII at that time.)\r\n\r\nBefore
    lower-case was added to ASCII, ^ was an up-arrow instead of a caret and _ was
    a back-arrow instead of an underscore, also.\r\n\r\nAnd | was a broken vertical
    bar because the EBCDIC vertical bar was mapped to ! instead of it, and the EBDIC
    logical not was mapped to ^ instead of ~, because PL/I programmers insisted that
    all their characters needed to be in the uppercase-only subset, thus preventing
    ASCII ! from translating to EBCDIC !... a nightmare.\r\n\r\nBasically, though,
    the rule is:\r\n\r\nWhen you think of Unicode, think of ASCII.\r\n\r\nWhen you
    think of ASCII, think of [[http://museum.mit.edu/nom150/entries/1302|this]]."
