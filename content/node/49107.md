body: "We have an internal form that I am redesigning. This is a work order that lists
  instructions for building a custom guitar. This is laser printed on 11x17 smooth
  white cardstock that is folded in half. Most of the text is 12pt, with a few headlines.
  The form is a text file and is basically a list with bold headings.\r\n\r\nThe purpose
  is to clearly communicate the customer's wishes to the craftsmen that are building
  the guitar.  After the guitar is made, the work order with its construction notes
  from the builders goes into a filing cabinet and can hold related documents to the
  build for future reference.\r\n\r\nI've tried a few fonts that I have in my library,
  but I haven't been happy with any yet. RTF Amethyst makes a funny looking \"Walnut\"
  and I use that word on about half the forms. Puyfoulhoux's Classica looks great
  in text, but these little groups of words make the \"p\" and \"b\" look sparse and
  hard to read. I've been the most happy with Simonson's Grad, but the underline doesn't
  connect, and I use a \"____    __ /__ /__\" for someone to initial and date the
  work completed. \r\n\r\nSo now I'm shopping again. I looked at Parkinson's Sutro
  and Stone's Serif. I've always wanted a reason to buy Lew's Whitman. Poppl-Pontifex
  BQ might work. I'm leaning toward a serif, but the right sans would move me. I could
  just use Times that we've had on the form since I got an HPIIID printer with it
  on the cartridge, but I'm hoping that by selecting just the right font, the form
  will be easier to read and that nobody even notices the font. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  for nominations for my shopping list?"

  body: "Well that's pretty funny, Simon. Actually, Stone Serif seems to work pretty
    well for these little lists. My dad liked the sample I printed, and nothing really
    stood out as awkward, which is a good start.\r\n\r\nNeed more time to digest and
    fresh eyes to view in a few days. "
