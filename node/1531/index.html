  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is a story from Monday October 6th, New York Daily News. <BR> <BR>It was a room with a zoo <BR> <BR>She shared apt. with tiger, gator <BR> <BR>By LISA L. COLANGELO, WARREN WOODBERRY Jr. and DAVE GOLDINER <BR>DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS <BR> <BR>Ming the Bengal-Siberian tiger gives a heart-stopping stare from his cage at a Long Island pit stop yesterday. <BR>With its mouth duct-taped shut, Al, the caiman alligator that shared a Harlem apartment with a big cat and humans, is loaded into a truck bound for Midwest animal refuge. <BR>A woman who shared a Harlem apartment with a 425-pound tiger said yesterday she was terrified at first - but soon got used to living with the man-eater down the hall. <BR> <BR>Caroline Domingo told the Daily News she couldn't believe her eyes when she spotted the big cat roaming free in the apartment where she and her husband rented a room from tiger-owner Antoine Yates, 37. <BR> <BR>&quot;I walked in the door and [the tiger] was standing there looking at me,&quot; recalled Domingo, 49, a seamstress. &quot;I said, 'I know I'm not seeing this. I know that wasn't a tiger.' <BR> <BR>&quot;He turned around and looked at me like I was a damn fool,&quot; she said. <BR> <BR>But eventually, she said, &quot;We all became family.&quot; <BR> <BR>Her amazing account came a day after cops removed the Bengal-Siberian tiger named Ming. <BR> <BR>It also came amid questions of how a tiger and an alligator could have lived in the Drew Hamilton public housing complex for nearly two years without the city having a clue. <BR> <BR>&quot;You wonder what goes on,&quot; Mayor Bloomberg said. &quot;You can't write a book about this.&quot; <BR> <BR>Domingo told The News she got used to living with Ming, who played in a custom sandpit and gobbled 25 chicken thighs a day in the fifth-floor flat on Adam Clayton Powell Blvd., between 141st and 142nd Sts. <BR> <BR>The carnivorous beast was friendly and once gave her a hug with its declawed front paws. <BR> <BR>&quot;I didn't have a bruise or mark on me,&quot; said Domingo, who moved into the apartment earlier this year and was staying with friends yesterday. &quot;I was scared but I wasn't scared.&quot; <BR> <BR>Impurrfect family <BR> <BR>The menagerie began to unravel on Wednesday when Ming mauled Yates as he tried to stop him from attacking a pet kitten. <BR> <BR>Tipsters later told cops about the tiger, and police launched a commando-style raid to subdue Ming on Saturday. <BR> <BR>Both Ming and a 5-1/2-foot caiman alligator named Al were headed yesterday to an Ohio wildlife preserve, where they will be checked out for a month. <BR> <BR>Yates was being treated at a hospital in Philadelphia, where he fled last week, and will face criminal endangerment charges. A source said Yates has developed an infection and would be hospitalized most of the week. <BR> <BR>&quot;That cat could have killed a lot of people in that building,&quot; said Larry Wallach, an animal handler working with the nonprofit Center for Animal Care and Control. <BR> <BR>It was still unclear how Yates managed to keep the big cat for so long, when Ming was an open secret among tenants. <BR> <BR>Housing Authority officials said neighbors had complained about the smell of urine wafting from Yates' apartment, but insisted no one mentioned a tiger. It wasn't immediately clear if the complaints were investigated. <BR> <BR>&quot;We will be looking into the entire situation to determine what was known or not known,&quot; said Howard Marder, a Housing Authority spokesman. &quot;Nobody could recall anything like this.&quot; <BR> <BR>Weighty situation <BR> <BR>Tenants are barred from having more than one pet in public housing projects, and the pet must weigh 40 pounds or less. <BR> <BR>Ming might have been about that size as a cub about two years ago when Yates brought him to the five-bedroom apartment where he once lived with his mother and several siblings. <BR> <BR>Yates treated Ming like a son, building the sandpit and providing balls for him to play with, Domingo said. Al lived in another bedroom, in a fiberglass tank. <BR> <BR>Yates and his girlfriend shared another room, and her 4-year-old son had his own bedroom. <BR> <BR>Domingo said the living room was well-kept and the furniture showed no signs of damage, even though Ming had the run of the place. <BR> <BR>Yates, a devoted animal lover, scrubbed Ming's room with bleach and Pine Sol and ran to the market every day for chicken, she said. &quot;That was his baby, as far as he was concerned,&quot; Domingo said. <BR> <BR></div>
