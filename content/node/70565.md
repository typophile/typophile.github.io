  issue of neglected Cyrillic alphabet.\r\n\r\nIt's a kind of orphan at the moment.
  It was developed during the Medieval time in the Bulgarian kingdom. Following very
  close graphical characteristic of Greek alphabet, together with Latin, the new alphabet
  become third one from the same family. Alphabet was adopted by many countries, among
  them the biggest  slavonic one - Russian Empire. After Bulgaria was conquered from
  the Ottoman empire in 15th century the development of this alphabet actually stopped.
  It was like that until 18th century, when Peter The Great of Russia decided to make
  some reforms in it. Some letters were disregarded, others emerged, third received
  graphical changes. Initially good, this Reform somehow made the gap between similar
  Greek and Latin grow bigger.\r\n\r\nRight now, if you look at the font, containing
  all of the above mentioned alphabets, you can see very strange and obscure things.\r\nLetters
  like \"K\", \"k\" which even sound alike in all alphabets have in fact different
  faces. Letters \"\u0416\", \"\u0436\" suffers from the same \"identity crises\".
  \"g\", \"n\", \"u\" and other regular letters, which, in fact can be similar in
  latin and cyrillic are intently crated with different face, bringing an inconstancy
  in the general font characteristic.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues from Russia are involved
  in this process, and without any intention to offend them, I want to say that such
  treatment of the fonts is not making any good for them. On other hand, designers
  from non cyrillic countries, creating cyrillic fonts are trapped in the same \"mistake\".
  My opinion is that the bigger similarity the easier, cleaner and stylish the font
  will be to read and look, especially when bilingual text are used in the document.\r\n\r\nPlease,
  any thoughts?"

    between Bulgaria and Russia may be one of them. But I would not call this \u201Cidentity
    crisis\u201D.\r\n\r\nIf I understand you properly, you are concerned with glyphic
    detailing which, e.g., makes the Cyrillic K in a font looking different from the
    Latin K or the Greek Kappa. \u2013 Am I right?\r\nWell, these things have been
    discussed many times already as I recall. What you label as \u201Cvery strange
    and obscure things\u201D is perhaps just a certain convention, one of several
    in existence. Then the font designer has to make decisions, tricky ones, sometimes.
    But such issues belong to type in general, to multi-scriptiv type in particular
    and are not peculiar for the Cyrillic branch alone.\r\nI myself decided to just
    issue [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=315|Andron Cyrillic]]
    in different variants. Others implement glyph variation options via Opentype features

    for (Bulgarian?) Cyrillic. "

  body: "I like it when Cyrillic and Latin look very similar, but if I were to make
    a font with very Latin looking Cyrillic letters I think I'd be criticized for
    not understanding the subtleties of Cyrillic. I'd imagine that designers whose
    first alphabet is not Cyrillic (or Greek) are under a good deal of pressure to
    include all sorts of regional details in order to prove they're qualified to work
    with those alphabets in the first place. Better to include lots of unnecessary
    subtle changes than to leave out a few important ones. \r\n\r\nIt's funny you
    mention k\u2014 in Russian, at least, the arm of the k pretty consistently points
    down or forward, whereas Latin k arms are mostly straight or curved up. That particular
    detail is one I'd be hesitant to leave out were I to design my own Cyrillic face
    (perhaps a Bulgarian k is not quite like a Russian k?).\r\n\r\nOddly enough, just
    yesterday I replaced the old looped k in my little cursive font with (what seems
    to me) a Russian-looking forward-pointing k. I kinda like it and intend to stick
    with it...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quackerjack_4605.png]"

    developing the <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf\">Modern
    Suite</a>, released in 2008, I decided to include Bulgarian alternates (as well
    as the Big Yus character), prompted by a Maxim Zhukov seminar on Cyrillics organized
    by the TDC in New York, and based on my study of types published by the Hermes
    foundry, and discussions here at Typophile.\r\n\r\nThese Modern Suite alternates
    are not designated as the default for text identified as being set in Bulgarian
    (BGR), but are accessible as an OpenType stylistic set. That seemed like the \"best
    practice\". AFAIK (I have 10 distributors, so aren't always up to date on who
    is buying my fonts), nobody in Bulgaria has licensed any Modern Suite fonts yet,
    so the Bulgarian alternates appear to be a waste of time--although I haven't made
    any efforts to promote the fonts in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nTypeTogether's <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Skolar\">Skolar</a>
    also includes Bulgarian alternates.\r\n\r\nBTW, we have had a similar situation
    with the Latin script, where the single bowl version of \"g\" may be considered
    more European than the double bowl version, which tends to be preferred in North
    American sans serifs. At least, during most of the 20th century.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the related pronunciation of \"v\", \"w\" and \"q\" has varied across the centuries

    quite differently in different parts of the countries where it is spoke.\r\nSo

  body: "If I were to try to take the Greek alphabet, and modify the lowercase of
    it so that when the uppercase Greek letter looks like an uppercase Latin letter,
    then the lowercase letter matches again - and create new lowercase forms, then,
    for the other Greek letters to \"fit in\"... people would laugh at me, and certainly
    the Greeks would never use such a thing.\r\n\r\nYet, there are different forms
    for the capital Greek letter Upsilon, and Greeks are more likely than Latin-alphabet
    users to use a form that looks like the Latin Y.\r\n\r\nI think you are asking
    a legitimate question, even though what you seem to be asking for sounded like
    my silly example of making Greek conform to Latin. The Greek and Latin alphabets
    developed naturally over a long period of time. The Cyrillic alphabet is of more
    recent origin, and perhaps the current form used in Russia and Bulgaria is an
    arbitrary and artificial modification, instead of a natural development, from
    the larger Slavonic alphabet.\r\n\r\nGreek has its own problems. The \"Porson\"
    style of Greek typeface, most familiar to Latin alphabet users, mixes a cursive,
    sloped lowercase with upright Roman-like capitals. This is very handy when typesetting
    mathematics in English, but it isn't well suited to normal text composition. The
    Greeks use other styles, therefore, such as sans-serifs, but the fact that there
    is no really Hellenic serifed style to standardize on as the basis for Greek typefaces
    is a problem.\r\n\r\nThe Latin upper and lower case is artificial too, a shotgun
    marriage of Roman capitals with uncials. But if someone tried to reinvent the
    alphabet to replace it with something more \"organic\", but unfamiliar, except
    as a curious display font (i.e. Peignot)... it would not fly.\r\n\r\nExcept perhaps
    for some subtle changes of peculiarities in the ordinary serifed fonts... such
    as stepping back from Bodoni/Didot styling... there is not much that can be done,
    I think, in the way of a general reform. That doesn't mean that adventurous experimentation,
    though, cannot be engaged in."

  body: "It occurs to me that I have perhaps misconstrued the goals of the original
    poster, or, at least, attempted to make a correction to his post that was irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I think that there is a problem with Greek letterforms due to the Porson Greek
    convention arising while the Greek language was suppressed under Turkish occupation,
    and, in fact, one might even ask if Greek needs an upper and lower case duality
    any more than, say, Hebrew... that may be irrelevant to the original poster's
    goals.\r\n\r\nInstead, if one accepts as a postulate that the Greek alphabet in
    its present form is a satisfactory expression of the Greek national consciousness,
    on a par with the Latin alphabet for the countries that use it, then it is possible
    to focus on the specific question of raising the Cyrillic alphabet to parity.
    With a lower-case that is a mix of Latin alphabet lower-case and Latin alphabet
    small-capitals, this is presumably not achieved.\r\n\r\nOnce the question is framed
    in this way, the solution becomes obvious. For Cyrillic to raise its head with
    equal dignity to Greek... the reform would be to retain the existing Cyrillic
    upper-case, but to replace the lower-case with one based on Glagolitic letter
    forms."
