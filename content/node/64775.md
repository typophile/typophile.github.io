  body: "I think [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/mussica/|Mussica]] might
    be something like you are describing, but the original sample is some sort of
    Antique Roman style. Sackers Antique Roman is similar, but with much lower x-height.
    I think I have seen that weird 'f' before, but I can't find it.\r\n\r\n- Mike
