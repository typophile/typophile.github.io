Think: Manhole covers, the type gives the name of the manufacturer and perhaps the city, but it must also create grip for the soles of shoes. Braille (probably spelt wrong) must be legible to the hand not the eye.  <BR> <BR>What I need help with is coming up with more examples&hellip;so post away. <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>P.S.

Public space could include everything from a parking street meter to that generic closed store sign that shows when it's open. Office could have the hold button on a telephone all the way to the postal systems stamp over a letter.

		<div class="commentbody">Ian, I think you're trying to get at something  <BR>more tangible, like when type goes beyond visual  <BR>communication to function as something else  <BR>entirely. In your example, type must provide grip  <BR>on a man-hole cover. It's no longer just type,  <BR>it's actually a texture with a purpose. <BR> <BR>I can only think of a couple, like type on the  <BR>soles of shoes that also provides grip. <BR> <BR>How about the raised letters on credit cards so  <BR>one can make a rubbed transfer of the info? <BR> <BR>Or how about when birds nest in the counters of  <BR>large signs. <BR> <BR>Or when the type on a medicine bottle is raised  <BR>so that it can't fade or be rubbed off, which  <BR>also provides grip. <BR> <BR>Am I taking your example way too literally?  <BR>If so, please kill me quickly.</div>

You are perfectly right in saying that I'm interested in type that surpasses the function the type designer originaly intended. <BR> <BR>Typography that is taken to another level, not one of aesthic value, but of a practical nature.</div>

There's also the &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; sign (formerly &quot;HOLLYWOODLAND&quot;) which could qualify as public art, or at the very least, a major landmark. <BR> <BR>Here in Utah, high schools, colleges and universities have enormous whitewashed concrete letters embedded in the sides of mountains (Brigham Young University's &quot;Y&quot; or the University of Utah's &quot;U&quot;). An extention of this was the huge light sculpture of the Olympic rings which adorned the mountain near the &quot;U&quot; at the Salt Lake City Olympics. <BR> <BR>I also came up with children's building blocks &ndash; the cubes with letters and numbers marking the faces of the cube.

		<div class="commentbody">hopefully this post isn't too confusing. <BR> <BR>when i considered functional type to meaning, i equated it with its form. lets say i were to copy the aesthetic of a postal systems stamp {that stamp the postal office puts on a the stamp that you put on an envelope} and change the words of that system stamp to something that really didn't relate to its form. if i was a person that takes visuals for granted, perhaps I'd look at that circular mark and understand through its form that its gone through the mail system. if that's the case than its functional to me. <BR> <BR>w/ all that said though, i think that if a letter that a sign maker has produced works for support for a bird as a home for its nesting materials then whom i'm a to disagree w/ its function? i hadn't considered that materlal aspect as much as i will now which is very cool in that if the original question hadn't been asked i would be no further ahead.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks a million everyone. The suggestions are great! You've really filled my head with tons of ideas. I love the alphabet soup. <BR> <BR>I'm looking at this from an Irish perspective naturaly because I live in Ireland. The reason I want to write articles like this is because in Ireland there is a serious lack of interest in typography, something I want to address. We have never been famous for our designs, unlike the Netherlands, and I think it boils down to people becoming too safe in their offices sitting in front of their computers. I want them to read about design and not be overwhelmed by the technicalities (such as ledding and EMs). I would like them to perhaps look at design from a slighty different angle than they normally would. It would pleasure me to think that someone on the bus would go &quot;hey thats what that guy was on about&quot; as they drove past an aspect of design after reading one of my articles. <BR> <BR>So here I go on my merry quest&hellip; <BR>=)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually there is a history of beautiful lettering and design elements (e.g. knotwork) to come out of Ireland. Some of the most famous illuminated manuscripts ever are Irish. The look is a bit over-exposed in the U.S., but it definitely gives you a starting point. Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">why yes supreme knower of all, <BR>it did for me at least when I realized I had to lay out a magazine in Ethiopic and was informed of the new fonts they've just released for communication&hellip;.before it was either that or scanning the articles or english. <BR> <BR>here's some background from: <BR><A HREF="http://www.ethiopic.com/index2.htm" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.ethiopic.com/index2.htm">http://www.ethiopic.com/index2.htm</a></A> <BR> <BR>Ethiopic or Geez is one of the oldest alphabets and has been in use in Ethiopia for more than 3,000 years. Until we computerized Ethiopic, the alphabet was printed manually or in the printing presses. Starting in 1982 we have taken the beautiful Ethiopic through DOS (ModEth, 1988) and Windows 3.0, 3.1 and 95. We have continued to develop applications for communicating with Ethiopic scripts via e-mail and the Internet since 1994. Our Ethiopic scripts contain the 480+ characters and require a maximum of two keystrokes to type each character. Our clients have started enjoying Ethiopic HTML (and HDML) on the information superhighway. Our sites are under continuous construction and the pages will have many language alphabets. Currently most of our Ethiopic web pages are in English and Amharic (Aírµ) languages. We expect to see documents in many of the languages of this historic African region in the near future. As of January 1997, Ethiopia has obtained limited access to the Internet and this has enabled Ethiopians to see our multi-lingual site for the first time. However, the use of Ethionet requires prior publication of Ethiopic documents using our software.  <BR> <BR>These pages are also dedicated to Ethiopic and the technology we have been developing and standardizing for it. You will find some free software or links to software for use with Geez documents. We will have many links to Ethiopic and Ethiopia related references, news, lessons, products, advertisements, organizations, entertainment, etc. in Amharic and English. This is the multi-lingual Ethiopic information superhighway at its infancy.  <BR> <BR>Our products are protected through pending patent, copyright, trade secrets, etc. We have also submitted patent application to the Ethiopian government though there was no patent protection in Ethiopia. (In spite of these, our fears have come true by the proliferation of copycats to plagiarize our products. Beware of copycats who would try to peddle incomplete character sets and macros as Ethiopic software. None of the copycats can type the Ethiopic characters using two keystrokes or less per character or post Ethiopic documents on the Internet. Click here to read about our concern and elaboration on this topic.) Click here for the Amharic version of this introduction.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Miss Spgrowl, <BR>As that page states, Ethiopic digital fonts have been around since '82. By &quot;westernized&quot; I thought you meant the actual forms (not the technology), not least because printing -from movable type- was invented in *Korea*. <BR> <BR>BTW, Geez is a syllabary, not an alphabet, and it's nowhere near that old. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yes the forms were changed. I did mean the forms coincidentally the tech has changed for them with the web too. there are 2 different sets of Ethiopic since the keyboard came around. the 82' typeface was altered to facilitate typing. its not the same as the original that is hand written. <BR> <BR>1982 wasn't that far away in terms of what I thought was typographical/functionality/change worthy of mention in a book. <BR> <BR>anywho, I'm not arguing, I thought your expression sounded sarcastic But I'm not talking out of my ass.</div>

And just the type of thing I'd like to add to my presentation in Rome (even though I'm supposed to be cutting down on the content&hellip;), since one thing I'm trying to show is how technology can reduce cultural authenticity. Sinhalese is one great example: they actually changed some basic spelling to make it easier to typeset! <BR> <BR>So, does that Ethiopic site have any info on this phenomenon, or do you have other good sources? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
