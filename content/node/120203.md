body: "I'm a market analyst generating high-level reports for executives in the health
  care industry. Soon, I'm going off on my own and need a new serif / sans serif pairing.
  Currently our company uses Garamond 11pt for most of  the body copy, which appears
  very professional and has always been one of my favorites. Helvetica (Neue is the
  sans serif.) But I need to distinguish myself from my current company, and while
  I'm in no way a designer, I do pay attention to the look and feel of my documents.
  \r\n\r\nSuggestions? Didot/Optima? Berling/Franklin Gothic? Palatino/Whitney? Please
  help! I'm out of my league and want to start off right.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
