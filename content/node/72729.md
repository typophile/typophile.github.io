  only found a selection on fontshop and very few on myfonts.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated. They can be free or pay fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    system, but I've always liked <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_amman/">Amman</a>.

    thanks for the link. I haven't seen that one on fontshop. I'm a little confused
    by their system also. They don't make it easy to find everything."

    I find myself time and time again going back to the Linotype fonts as linked above.\r\n\r\n@Brandvue
    you are probably aware of this, but these fonts won't work with InDesign or Quark
    out of the box. You need right to left software, such as InDesign ME."
