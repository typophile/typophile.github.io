body: I'm doing a slight redesign for a magazine which currently uses Barmeno as it's
  main font. The editor wants to keep this as he thinks it gives the title a modern,
  friendly look. Any suggestions for serif fonts I can pair with Barmeno? I was thinking
  of using barmeno for heading and the serif for the text... I am a bit of a beginner
  when it comes to typography! There is no budget to buy new fonts so I would be using
  ones supplied with the Adobe suite. Thanks for any suggestions!

    it might be worth a try."
