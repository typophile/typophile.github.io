body: "I'm going to get a tattoo this summer of quotation marks on my hips\u2014something
  that looks like this (vaguely NSFW) https://skitch.com/lauramwebster/fjte6/img-2610.
  (That's me, they're just drawn on at the moment. And that image is flipped horizontally,
  which is to say that my mole fits as punctuation\u2014I drew those on in the mirror
  without realizing they were backwards.)\r\n\r\nHowever, as a writer and someone
  who appreciates beautiful type, I feel that the typeface I end up selecting should
  be something specific. I love the look of rounded quotation marks, which generally
  seem to belong to the serif family of things... Quotation marks which are simply
  slanted lines aren't going to cut it.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.
  I hope this is in the right forum... let me know if not and I'll move it."

  body: I also like Garamond and Productus, but Farnham is gorgeous as well. Is it
    bad that I want the same tattoo, just in a different place? Maybe I should get
    an ampersand instead, I don't want to share a tattoo with someone.
