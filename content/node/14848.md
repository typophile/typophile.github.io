  to see the cover not adorned in a photograph, but rather, typography.\r\n\r\nNow,
  I don't know how frequently the NG does this, but for me, it was a nice shot in
  the arm--everyone knows how the NG and its cover are synonymous with photography.\r\n\r\nSo
  right away, I'm thinking that this issue is something special. The designer's use
  of type has let me know this, and in the moment, I'm really into the play on design
  here, to communicate a unique message.\r\n\r\nAnd then they go and kill it by declaring
  'special issue' at the bottom. Elegant design, great type, followed by a 'just in
  case you don't get it' disclaimer. Ah, well."

  body: "National Geographic has had one of the highest standards for photography,
    editorial, layout, typography and print reproduction for DECADES!\r\n\r\nI haven't
    dissected one (meaning close detailed examination) for a few years, but if you
    take the time you will discover their superb attention to typography. According
    to friends who were employed there, National Geographic adheres to strictly established
    \"house\" standards (style guides) for all phases of pre-press, printing and finishing.\r\n\r\nIt
    is no wonder that for this important \"SPECIAL (map of Africa) ISSUE\" they went
    all type with a subordinate graphic (but high-recognizable shape). I haven't seen
    this issue yet, but from the cover alone, you can immediately tell that this ain't
    you mom's version of a colorful travelog but a journalistic wake-up call.\r\n\r\nAs
    stated on their <a href=\"http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0509/editor.html\"
    target=\"new\">web site</a>:\r\n<em>They are stories whose time has come. With
    that in mind, National Geographic Editor Chris Johns led the production of a special
    edition on Africa. In this issue we look at the impact of humans on the environment
    and the fate of Africa's great animals. We examine the consequences of oil wealth
    in impoverished Chad and the plight of the Democratic Republic of  the Congo's
    Mbuti Pygmies as outsiders invade their forest home. We contemplate the relationship
    between people and wildlife through the eyes of an African writer returning to
    Zambia. We take the pulse of life in Kenya's bustling capital of Nairobi and ponder
    the future of HIV-positive South Africans, who tell their stories in their own
    words. Listen to the Editor remark on why, at this particular time in history,
    Africa is so important to the rest of the world and how we can help as it forges
    ahead.</em>"

    :0)\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I bought \"100 years of National Geographic\" on
    CD. They scanned all the magazines -- including ads -- and put them out as a 40-CD
    set. Unfortunately, trying to fit ~30 magazines into each CD forced them to compress
    the hell out of the scans ... which totally destroyed the typography & the photography.
    It was often hard to tell what the photos were all about, and the type was barely
    readable.\r\n\r\nBut for all that, it was a wonderful resource during an extended
    tour of Latin America. A search on San Blas, Mexico, turned up an article dating
    back to the 1920s -- when the author had to ride for weeks on the back of a burro
    to get there.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see an enhanced edition, possibly put out on
    DVDs. I wonder if they saved the original, non-compressed scans...\r\n\r\nJay\r\n"

    the Carter face used for \"Africa\" wasn't drawn for use at that size -- the bar
    on the f doesn't align, etc. And the spacing is atrocious. Isn't anybody bothered
    by the \"ri\" combination? A tough pickle, but no excuse anyway. There is always
    a solution...\r\n\r\nI'll just get on my high horse and state baldly that most
    designers\r\nhave no idea how to compose large display type and how to have it\r\nmassaged
    appropriately. Tight spacing is especially unforgiving.\r\n"
