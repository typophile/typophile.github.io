body: "So I recently saw Moon (great movie, by the way). I kind of laughed when I
  saw that they used Eurostile in the film for \"Lunar Industries\" as well as signage
  and such on the moon base (the titles were Bank Gothic - another popular choice).
  Clearly this is a visual clich\xE9, but II'm having a hard time remembering where
  else I've seen this. So I'm asking typophile - what other movies/tv shows can you
  think of?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nPreferably within the movie/series, but if it's used
  for titles that's okay too. I did look up Eurostile and Microgramma on Wikipedia,
  and came up with these:\r\n\r\n2001: A Space Odyssey\r\nThe Andromeda Strain\r\nGerry
  Anderson's Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Space: 1999 and UFO\r\nSeveral Star
  Trek movies, and ST: Enterprise\r\nBSG (main title)\r\n\r\nIf there's enough of
  them I'll even make a video compilation (aka a <a href=\"http://waxy.org/2008/04/fanboy_supercuts_obsessive_video_montages/\">supercut</a>)."

    used Bank Gothic in its Main Title sequences (and in some seasons, for the end
    credits, IIRC), not Eurostile or Microgramma. The word \"Battlestar\" in the BSG
    logo itself, though, is something Microgramma-ish.\r\n\r\nFor a few years, a few
    years ago, Doctor Who spots on BBC One used Bank Gothic sparingly, too (leading
    up to \"Voyage of the Damned\" and Season Four, I think)."

    version of Eurostile; as the marines venture down to Sub-level 3 of the atmosphere
    processor, each floor has a big, glowing Eurostile name and number. \r\n\r\nA
    geeky, non-typographic aside: the atmosphere processor is actually a decomissioned
