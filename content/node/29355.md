  \u0105 \u017C \u0142 \u015A \r\n\r\nThey display well in Indesign and Illustrator,
  in Myriad Pro, but not in the Rockwell version we have. I guess I'm looking for
  a Central European version or character set.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    don't seem to be included in most typefaces. But, I found <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=rockwell\">Linotype
    Rockwell</a> to contain the characters.\r\n"

    on the other pages. So now I guess I'm not so sure. How could it preview on one

    I'd assume they are more sensitive to your needs.

  body: Ok. I know why the preview changed. It appears, if you <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rockwell-mt-2/rockwell/">follow
    this link</a>, that <strong>only</strong> the Windows Truetype version of the
    font contains the characters. This makes sense, or should right(?), as Truetype
    can hold more glyphs. Or am I just lost?
