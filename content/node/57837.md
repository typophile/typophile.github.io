  seems to be a slight difference in weight between the right and left square brackets?
  (the right looks slightly heavier) I'm not sure if there is a reason for this (perhaps
  hinting)? It appears so on screen and in print! Strange.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Leonski,\r\n\r\nof course there is no reason for this. It is just that
    kind of mistakes that sneak their way through all quality tests. FSI and I recently
    prepared an update of FF DIN by extending the cyrillic character set and adding
    Cyrillics to the italic and condensed weight. In this process we also fixed this
    bug in FF DIN light, regular, medium and bold. In the black weight and in the
    italic and condensed weight, the brackets have always been right. The updated
    version is now being mastered, so it will be available soon.\r\n\r\nAlbert-Jan
