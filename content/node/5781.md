body: sorry to post here, but it&#39;s the only place i could post because i&#39;m
  not yet registered... but you typophiles could probably help me out with this.  i
  know this must be pretty simple, because i see it done everywhere, but how do you
  add an outline to fonts?  i just cant seem to figure it out.  here&#39;s an example
  of what i&#39;m talking about.. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41462.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>it just seems so easy, but for some reason i cant figure it out.  hopefully
  one of you advanced in adobe or corel can help me out, unless its easier than that!

  body: easy..! here one version How-To-Do-How-Do-You-Do?! <BR>use illustrator..  <BR>2
    layers with the text.  <BR>Create Outlines..  which makes the type into an object..
    so be sure you have not misspelled your text! <BR>Layer 1 being on top with the
    text white. <BR>2nd Layer with text black..  and then you outline the lines and
    make the stroke bigger... untill you get the amount of blackness around the white
    text. <BR>When you are satisfied.. use &#40;MAC CMD &#43; Y   or WIN CTRL &#43;
    Y  which will take you beneath the surface if you know what i mean...&#41; and
    select the &#34;white arrow&#34; and select the inner lines and delete them. Get
    it? Then CMD&#43;Y up to the surface again... <BR> <BR>so now you have 2 layers..
    Group them if you want so that they will move together into one layer..  change
    colour etc etc..  and then you are all spiffed!! <BR> <BR>

  body: Ryan all those techniques are fine but the best way is create your type, make
    it white and go to the appearance pallet. There is a little arrow head at the
    top right of the pallet, hit it and under the pull-down menu add new stroke. Move
    the new stroke behind your type and scale it to suit yourself. Or select the stroke
    and under the edit menu select offset path and you can make it any size you  need.
    The benefit of this method is you can change the typeface and the stroke changes
    too. Useful with clients who change their minds.

  body: I have to bookmark this thread! I play with Illustrator all the time, but
    I don&#39;t use these techniques enough to remember them. It feels like I have
    to re-learn each time I need to create an effect. I know this isn&#39;t an Illustrator
    forum, but it&#39;s nice to get tips from the pro&#39;s.

    to.. Great timesaver! You can add all the offsets and effects you want and even
    save the whole apperance by clicking the &#34;New&#34; button in the Graphic Styles
    palette.'

  body: My usual approach in Illustrator is to set the type I want to outline, then
    make a copy and paste right behind the original, then add a heavy stroke to the
    copy. That way you get the original letterforms plus the part of the stroke from
    the copy that extends outward. The easy way to get at the copy is by selecting
    both by dragging the selection tool over both of them, then using shift and deselecting
    the top one. <BR> <BR>When you&#39;ve got the stroke you want, and it&#39;s time
    to finish up the job, choose paths/outline stroke from the object menu, then use
    the unite tool in the Pathfinder palette to get rid of all the inner paths that
    the outline stroke command creates. To really finish it off, you may want to eliminate
    some of the little bumps that are created, such as what you see around the top
    of the C of &#34;Spaceman.&#34; Makes it look more like you did the outlining
    yourself instead of having the program do it for you. It will take some practice
    to get the hang of it &#40;especially using the pathfinder palette successfully,
    as it sometimes does weird things&#41;, but it&#39;s a useful skill to have.

  body: well...  i will stick and spiff to my layers.. <BR>first i make the text in
    one layer and then i just drag that layer to the &#34;Make New Layer&#34;-icon
    and then i will get a new identical layer  e x a c t l y  on top of the first
    layer. But that&#39;s me...  i have always been awkward and spiffely un-mainstream.
    <BR>i cannot help saying that this forum rocks! you can ask almost everything
    and get help or learn something new.. <BR>sometimes the internet is a great place
    to be.. <BR> <BR>

    3D Revolve and tried to rotate  the revolve, it re-renders but I have a way around

  body: Yes the other thread where Mark describes the letter-funkyfying secret is
    great.  <BR>Some times when I start up illustrator I have to keep myself from
    fiddling around with the appearance palette too much. Whenever I get started on
    that I just go on with that like a madman and forget all about time and space.
