body: "I was wondering when it became a custom to include the name of the book's typeface
  in the colophon... I can't remember seeing a book from pre-WW1 in which the typeface
  was named -- which is no surprise considering that the variety of available faces
  wasn't as wide as it is today, and people would call their faces things like \"Gew\xF6hnliche
  Antiqua\" (plain roman).\r\n\r\nThe oldest book I've seen doing this is from the
  (late?) twenties, IIRC, so my initial idea was that there might be a correlation
  with the paradigm shift(s) in typography (Morris, later on Tschichold). But even
  that seems like an exception to me; it looks more like a post-WW2 thing, but I'm
  not sure though, and the answer might depend on what parts of the world we're talking
  about. I could imagine, for example, the Kelmscott Press people did it, too...\r\n\r\n--

    Craig, for mentioning (and reviving) that thread! Some great colophons there,
    plus I learned that in English (unlike in some other languages) a colophon is
    not the same as the imprint, and that in English, the <em>imprint</em> is not
    part of the <em>front matter</em> (according to Wikipedia), whereas, for example,
    in German typography, it definitely is."

  body: Afraid I don't have my sources with me and my memory's hazy, but Aldus Manutius
    did describe the use of Griffo's new italic font in books <em>ca.</em> 1500, as
    did the printer for whom Griffo created another italic after he left the Aldine
    press. Perhaps, though, this is considered prefatory material rather than a colophon,
    and it certainly wasn't in the modern syntax (e.g., "This book was set in Francesco
    Griffo's small pica cancellaresca at the Aldine Press"). Still, these were printed
    notices of the type used.
