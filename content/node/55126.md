    not necessarily great CMSes.

  body: "Not necessarily, definitely.\r\n\r\nBut I was referring to typophile itself,
    the wiki, the threads, the blogs and the user pages all seem to be be based on
    the same wiki-like content management logic?\r\n\r\nIMHO the only way the whole
    can be more than the sum of the parts\u2026\r\nI really dislike it when a site
    has a main (static) part that is homegrown, and the blog, the wiki, the forum,
    are all different tack-on solutions that never integrate to the whole\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    recently saw a great wiki as a website,\r\nhttp://postspectacular.com/ (is a [[http://www.dokuwiki.org|dokuwiki]])\r\nYou
    don\u2019t really notice (I only did because of the favicon)\r\nBut that should
    be inherently great for collaboration etc., you have automatic versioning, granular
    permissions etc.\r\n\r\nI would agree that most wikis are awful at managing static
    content though.\r\nAt [[http://creativecommons.org/|creative commons]] (& the
    forthcoming [[http://openfontlibrary.fontly.org/|OFLB]]) they mash-up cchost with
    mediawiki, but I can imagine that to be a major hassle\u2026\r\n\r\nAnybody came
    across convincing examples of wikis functioning as general purpose websites?"
