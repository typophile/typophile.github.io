body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nThis is from Pantheon paperback edition of <em>Hopscotch</em>
  by Julio Cort\xE1zar, published in 1966. I cannot for the life of me, etc etc. The
  designers at Knopf guessed it was Primer, and most likely set in metal. My scan
  is from a reprint, so allow for thickening of everything. You can still see some
  of the remnants of a medium-to-high contrast face.\r\n\r\nI seem to be unable to
  attach or upload, so please go here to see the scan: http://www.sampottsinc.com/H/hopscotch_text_face_F.jpg\r\n\r\nI've
  highlighted some of the things that make this unusual (to me at least): the Century-like
  tail of the R with old-style figures, an unkerned f and a longish and quite vertical
  tail to the y. The italic is wide and certainly not of the Century style, and the
  single-story italic g throws me.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that it's derived from
  a Zapf face, perhaps some rounder, more classical kind of Melior. Or something that
  was an imitation of Caledonia, maybe (if it's odd, it might be Dwiggins, as they
  say).\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\nSam\r\n\r\n[The save Attachment error is \r\nAn HTTP

    BT [Semi Bold]</strong> - Copyright 1990-1999 Bitstream Inc.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/semi-bold/characters.html\r\nIs
    a bit lighter than your sample, but maybe there is also a Bold version.\r\n\r\n<strong>EDIT</strong>:
    Maybe this one is a closer match:\r\n<strong>Century751 No2 BT [Bold]</strong>\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/no-2-bold/\r\n\r\n\r\n..and
    for the italic:\r\n<strong>Century751 SeBd BT [Semi Bold Italic]</strong> - Copyright

    interesting detail is that both italic typefaces have the single story italic

  body: "Thanks, @fvilanakis  -- I tried whatthefont, but maybe they're not so good
    on Bitstream. It must be some pre-digital Primer/Century 751 as that would explain
    the slight variations. Up close in the book, the lc g is shaped a little different,
    but overall it must be that. Thanks for the Primer link Maxim!\r\n\r\nSP"
