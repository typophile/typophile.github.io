body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI recently started to cooperate with my girlfriend, we are building
  websites, and doing some corporate identity. I'm probably going to get a good job
  (a big one, about 3000\u20AC (which is not huge, but for us is way more than enough))
  and i need a portfolio, some business cards etc.\r\nThe problem is that we don't
  have a logo, we have a name, but we didn't brand ourselves yet!\r\nOur name is \"avance\"
  (forward) and comes from the evolution theory (more or less)... the thought behind
  it is that websites are part of human evolution, or generally that many of italian
  companies don't have good logo/websites because don't care about it, they are \"mentally
  old-style\", and we are looking for clients who want to move forward and get a nice
  dose of good branding.\r\n\r\nSo, we are in a hurry and i thought that the best
  thing to do is making a simple logo, with simple type.\r\n\r\nI made some sketches
  which i moved in illustrator:\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/coyg4h\r\n\r\nI used helvetica
  because, i think, it's a \"standard\" logo, which suits almost anything that wants
  to \"say nothing\".\r\nI'm looking for useful feedback and some suggestion about
  what type i should use, because helvetica isn't really \"forward\"!\r\n\r\nPS. I
  know that there's a sexy typeface named avance, but i'm uncertain about it's use."

    confuse having your business name in a logo/type scenario with branding - the

    misused some words, but still, i have to make a website and some business cards
    (and not only for one job, but the excitement for that is great)...\r\n\r\nSo,
    what you suggest is to not care about the logo/type i'm using for the moment,
    because doesn't really reflect what \"my brand\" is, and keep the whole work for
    later?"

  body: "Have you considered italicizing just the \"v\" alone ? Or it 90 deg ccw ?
    Though both versions may look a bit cliche without further tweaking.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and another quick thought - I'd try playing with the kerning. Something as simple
    as increasing the kerning gradually from the second letter to the last or perhaps
    moving just the last letter to the right. It will be dead simple and it should
    be quite unique and memorable."

    not the end all on the use of the concepts of <cite>brand</cite> and <cite>branding</cite>,
    but it gives you a big picture in which to imagine your brand.\r\n\r\nSometimes,
    design agencies choose to go simple, a trend documented by Marian Bantjes in a
