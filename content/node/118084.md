  body: "Perhaps the closest out of the box tiny/spur serif fonts to this lettering
    are:\r\nMythica http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/mythica/ Even has a similar
    convex curve to the leg on the _R_ Has several weights to handle the different
    versions sof the lettering.\r\nModesto http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/
    Note the close _E_. Several widths and weights.\r\nDon\r\n"
