  body: "Forged metal house numbers do not always have a counterpart in digital type
    (architects tend to have them custom made).\r\n\r\nInvert the |8| on Anna Light,
    and it comes the closest of anything I could find to all the numerals\u2014though
    obviously not a spot on match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/anna/\r\n\r\nJoost
    is a close second:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeotones/joost/\r\n\r\nFor
    the |8| alone, you could also try FT Digital Kauno:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/ft-digital-kauno/"
