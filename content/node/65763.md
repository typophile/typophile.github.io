  almost done making a vectorized version of this poster, the only thing missing now
  is the font.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    Since I presume the original poster has been made in seventies or early eighties
    it was first drawn on paper, then copied to cardboard and painted in gouache.
    I can see clearly that the artist of this poster has done exactly so type included.
    Cyrillic samples were very scarce and few so usually letters were drawn by hand
    just more or less to please the eye."

    I'm interested because I recently bought a Polish book on Polish poster art from
    1900 to 1950 which has a not-very-good English translation describing a stencil
    process used by Polish artists working for Soviet troops in the last year of WW2.\r\nWould
    the poster shown here have been reproduced by stencils rather than printing?"

    fade into the clouds. If people were using stencils to make posters it was probably
    due to the scarcity of materials during the war years."

  body: "The poster in the link no. It was printed by the offset machine. Probably
    the publishing house \"Plakat\" in Moscow where all the official propaganda posters
    were printed.\r\n\r\nThe standard way the posters were made in late seventies,
    early eighties - take a sheet of paper 60x90 cm and draw everything ready with
    a pencil. Then cover it with a sheet of thin paper to transfer it, copy with a
    pencil. \r\nThen take a cardboard 60x90 cm and pain it with a white latex wall
    paint (sieve it through a nylon stocking before) using a porolon roller. \r\nPaint
    the background. If white - just apply another coat of wall paint, if light colour
    add gouache to the wall paint, if dark - add a few drops of PVA glue to gouache
    to make it more durable. If you want to paint gradient like in this poster you
    paint half of the cardboard white, another half blue and take your roller and
    roll and roll and roll till you have achieved the desired.\r\nSmear the background
    of the transfer paper with a soft pencil, cover your painted cardboard with it
    and trace with a H3 pencil. On a dark gouache background don't smear the tracing
    paper, the pencil impression will be enough.\r\nThe lettering was done with a
    drawing pen for straight lines, then finished with a brush and corrected with
    a very fine brush with the background paint."

    I <em>love</em> that distinctive Soviet propaganda style!)"

    greatly over time and by artist within any given period. It\u2019s just uncommon
    to see images not in a few stereotypical modes."

  body: "Thanks everyone for replying, especially Kristians for the interesting technical
    insight.\r\n\r\nLately I've become extremely fascinated with Soviet era propaganda
    prints, but some extremely fascinating designs are only available either as low-res
    scans or rather expensive collector items, so I'm trying to vectorize as many
    as I can to make my own prints. A far cry from the splendor of the originals,
    but they make for some really cool posters."

    from what I could tell from the website.
