  Ultimately, it will be detailed on the interior of the letter forms, and have multiple
  colors.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nThanks,\r\nTerrance"

    can't insert. Its RGB, small file size, 590 pixels wide... I don't get it."

  body: "SWEET!\r\n\r\nTwo nitpicks:\r\n\r\n1. The bottom swash needs some bezier
    work to smooth it out ont he top where it passes the D (gets too fat to fast).
    I know the style is hand done, but it looks off.\r\n\r\n2. The left side of the
    u looks a little weak. Especially at the top. Try giving it a similar weight as
    the right side.\r\n\r\nWith these suggestions don't kill the hand crafted look.
    It's working!\r\n\r\nAlso, the dots on the u are a \xFC? Just making sure.\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: "Yeah, those are diacritics on the u. It's pronounced doo-cks. OK, yeah, I
    see what you mean on the swoosh. I'll fix it up. And the u, the weight and also
    the transition from bowl to stem could be smoother.\r\n\r\nThanks Randy"
