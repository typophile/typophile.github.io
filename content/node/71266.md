  me, who is not any kind of expert, the J looks like Georgia or NC Schoolbook, the
  M like Plantin. It's hard to believe they'd actually be from different fonts, but
  who knows? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/JM-out_6735.jpg]"

  body: "There is something about the serifs, in the way they are not sharp-edged,
    that is not typical. Ray Larabie's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/winthorpe/\">Winthorpe</a>
    has an M very much like this M, although a bit curved on top, and not curved in
    the left M leg as much. The J has the rounded serif, but it is too long and the
    hook and ball isn't right. It's possible that it was shortened and a ball terminal
    was grafted on, but that might be reaching a bit.\r\n\r\nTaken by itself, I think
    the J looks most like Scotch Roman, rather than New Century, but the serifs are
    not as soft looking as these. It's possible some tweaking was done, and if you
    consider that 'cheap' sometimes appeals to designers, it may have been an inexpensive
    (or free) font, or something that comes with standard font packages. I thought
    the Plantin M looked more twisted than this one.\r\n\r\nI think you could be right
    about mixed fonts, because there were no serif families I know that have this
    J and a similar splayed M.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It may also have a slight rounded stroke added to it. That would effectively
    round out the otherwise sharp serifs.

  body: "I agree James. I guess my point is that this is probably not a single 'stock'
    font. Some changes have been made, and probably more than one font was used.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nIf we work under the assumption that the two
    fonts are different, I definitely think Winthorpe is a possibility for the M.\r\n\r\nThe
    J still puzzles me. After a closer look, I think Schoolbook is out, but Scotch
    Roman doesn't look right to me either. Poking around a bit, I think <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-731/\">Century
    731</a> or something in the News (<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-705/\">News
    705</a>?) family might be more likely. Still, neither of those seem quite right
    either, and definitely I think it's possible that the serifs on the J were modified,
    perhaps to more closely match those on the M. "

  body: "And if the letters are being modified, why not consider that a ball was added
    to the hook of the J?  I kept looking for a match to the counter at the J hooks,
    and very few were anywhere near the right shape, mostly because the serif wasn't
    a round ball. If you add your own ball, you only need the 'jawline' of the J to
    be the right shape.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
