		<div class="commentbody">So, if this is the Answer, what is the Question? (In other words, what's your intention for the typeface?) It can be helpful to start your design with a brief, like &quot;This should be a text face in the style of Garamond, condensed approximately 5%, available for use with Monotype, Linotype, and hand setting.&quot; (That's a paraphrase of the brief for Sabon.) <BR> <BR>If you want to use this for ad work/short text/headings, it has promise, and with a bit of polish, it would find a niche.  <BR> <BR>If you want to use this for book work/long text, there's much more work ahead. In addition to the items Juan Pablo mentioned, the cap J also is likely to stand out. Remember that text faces tend to be conservative, and characters that &quot;pop out&quot; at the reader are not likely to lead to the typeface being used. <BR> <BR>Keep us posted on the progress!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is fun. I don't see it as a something that should be set in long books, but certainly in poetry or special editions of prose. This would be fun as something used in letterpress shops. <BR> <BR>I also like the -g- but I wonder if a few of the other glyphs could sway a little further towards the same level of quirkiness? The -j- has that too, and the -f- is working towards it. I see the -y- and -t- also have some of that stopped short feeling. However, the uppercase should probably maintain more solemnity. What other characters can you quirk?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for your coments and encouragement. <BR> <BR>&quot;if this is the Answer, what is the Question?&quot; hmm&hellip;  As this is my first font (but not my first attempt) it was a massive learning experience.  The Question was something along the lines of 'how hard can it be?'.  I've lost my innocence now.   <BR> <BR>But my intentions for the font was to create something I would want to use.  I'm an artist first, and I mostly use printed type to describe mine or others art.  Catalogues, postcards that sort of thing.  So short texts, information, presented in a smart and contemporary environment. <BR> <BR>'that g': my thinking was sometihng like this - traditional g; elegant but inefficient use of space (cramped) - modern* g; inelegant but efficient.  So i came up with a sort of hybrid of the two.  I think it works for now, non-type-interested people i've shown examples to haven't noticed it until i pointed it out.(* i don't know if 'modern' is acurate historically). <BR> <BR>The lowercase j and t. This typeface thinks the hooks traditionally put on these letters are calligraphic and inefficient and are therefore to be spurned.  Plus i've been enjoying Futura.  I know this has readability issues, and if my arm was twisted i would make a hooked t. <BR> <BR>As for the quirkiness of it.  Tiffanys coment about quirking other letters made me think.  The phrase 'stopped short feeling' had quite a lot of resonance.  I guess it comes from the influence of sans-serifs faces and my inner modernist.  <BR>It seemed that these letters could be quirked: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64106.gif" alt=""> <BR>(original in grey) <BR> <BR>I dont' think the k works, but i like the m, and arn't sure about the w.  I don't want to make it into a semi-serif. So maybe I should go further back on some letters.  But I want it to be a serious typeface. With useful quirks. The lack of a final serif on the new m reduces the width of a wide letter. <BR> <BR>I've adjusted the 'sad a' and b as suggested by Juan Pablo.  Totally redrawring the bowl of the a and making the top of the bowl of the b 2 degrees steeper. I think it is an improvement. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64107.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Titus, yes that corner of the Z is a bit arbitary,  it'll probably go.  about the X do you mean the junction is too low on the glyph, or do you think the heavyness is to do with the stroke contrast?  i see what you mean about the elephantishness of the @ :-) I was wanting to make it as small as possible, the large @ symbols allways seem to be out of place written in lowercase email adresses, and often too light.  I'll probably re-work it. <BR> <BR>Again thanks for your critiques - keep it coming. <BR> <BR>Ed</div>
