body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nI hope some one here will be able to help me with tricky issue:\r\nI
  need to find a font which have the gender symbols as glyphs. I need them for a ballet
  program with gender specific Choreographies. The Choreographer insists that they
  are part af the titles. He wants the middle o to be replaced with the symbols according
  to whichever of the two ballets being communicated.\r\n\r\nProblem is that they
  need to fit with our customdrawn corporate typeface(see attached image).\r\n\r\nHope
  someone here might have some suggestions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eidolon_6412.png]"

    to draw them up myself and ad them to the existing character set.\r\n\r\nI was
    hoping that there might already exist a font with the symbols, that have similar
    caracteristics."

    the one letter in InDesign. Mind to scale it to right size before pasting into
    text.\r\nFrode's idea of lc o sounds good to me."

  body: "Hi Nick\r\n\r\nThat does look very similar to our typeface. As i can see
    from the PDF sample, the symbols are not drawn in anyway to fit with the style
    of the typeface. So i wonder now, as i have no idea about the correct way of setting
    running text with these symbols, how would one set that title with the middle
    o replaced with one of the symbols?? Another thing is that we usually always set
    titles in Italic??\r\n\r\nAnyone??"

    range of glyphs, but for now where we just need these two symbols, we will probably
    wait with a purchase.\r\nThanks"
