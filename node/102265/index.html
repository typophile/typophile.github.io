<p>There are way too many fonts that do not have those underlined superscript symbols, so I&rsquo;d also like to know what is the recommended typographical practice in such cases. It seems that the practice of underlining such superscripts is slowly disappearing, but mainly because so many fonts don&rsquo;t have them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Youssef, I don&rsquo;t think that underlined ªº are actually required in Portuguese. It appears to be a typographical tradition widely adopted in Brazil and Portugual –like the double bar in $– but not a mandatory rule. You can note that Publico, a font developed specially to a newspaper from Portugal, does not include underlined ªº. Dino dos Santos, a Portuguese type designer, also does not include them in most of his works. Anyway, I prefer to have underlined ªº,  maybe because I saw this since my childhood.</p>
<p>Here are some other fonts which include underlined ªº:

Argo

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good point. The solution I included on my project is to have underlined ªº as alternates. When the language is Spanish or Portuguese, an OT command trigger the alternates automatically. I also included ordinal plurals &lsquo;as&rsquo; and &lsquo;os&rsquo;, which do not exist in Unicode but are also needed.</p>
<p>A small note: in OT and Unicode we have room to differentiate ªº as ordinals and ‘aeilmnorst’ as superscript and scientific superiors. In a proper OT enviroment, we could use one or another, without mixing. Unhappily, proper OT and Unicode applications are still barely available and type designers need to work around this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A couple years ago, I was contacted by the art director of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->O Globo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Rio de Janeiro to customize the ordinals in several styles of Whitman for the newpaper’s use. He explained: “To write correctly the ordinals in Portuguese they must have an hyphen behind the &lt;o&gt; and &lt;a&gt;” [by which he meant an underline beneath]. Their style guide, at the very least, demands these forms.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to me to have underlined ordinals as alternates to be deployed through language localization.</p>
<p>It also seems reasonable instead to have default underlined forms of ª and º for the glyphs which are thus encoded (i.e., when input directly into the text stream as U+00AA and U+00BA), and to have separate “plain,” raised forms of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->o<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to combine with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->e i l m n r s t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to be deployed through the {ordn} feature.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When it comes to typography, I wouldn’t listen that long to what teachers in primary schools say. In primary school, I was taught to underline anything important. It was not before the age of 12 that I heard about the meaning of ‘italics’ from my English teacher. She told me that ‘italics’ had nothing to do with Italy though, it was merely ‘printed another way’. When we made a mistake in handwritten texts we were told not to strike through, but to put the mistakes ‘between dots’. Unnecessary to say that the teachers frequently overlooked our corrections … Also I was taught that words are only words when all letters are being connected. At school I learned to „quote” like this. My typography teacher at the Academy of Arts told me that the publishers he worked for insisted on the ‘english’ way, and so did he. Another Dutch publishing house prefers «French» quotes though (but in the German way, i.e. without the word spaces). Typewriters are a questionable source too, I think. My parent’s typewriter had an italic beta instead of an ß. A typewritten ellipsis was three characters wide. All of this may be very interesting, but when it comes to design, it is the designer that has to make up his mind on wether that what the laymen advocates is really worth considering. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of underlining ª and º in a typeface is that they can only combined with the rest of the superior letters ‘aeilmnorst’ when these are being underlined too. These may be used in countries such as France, Great Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. Just to name a few. Many typographers and graphic designers from these countries might like that (in display typography), because the underscore might provide an additional interesting element, but on the other hand (in documents), many of them will not like to see them underlined because they perceive the underscore as visual pollution or as an archaic element. To me it is a matter of design, legibility, you name it, even of taste if you prefer, but not of ‘laymen’s law’</p>

<p>Alternates, as you &amp; Miguel propose, would be fine, but I get the sense that designers are overburdened? Personally, if it comes to choices, I&rsquo;d prefer the combining diacriticals to be included in fonts. That lets the users of type come up with solutions &amp; still stay syntactically correct.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Both Portuguese and Spanish had a handwritten tradition to use underlined ordinals. Through 20th Century, it seems Portugal slowly put this aside (maybe due to new technologies and European typographical inffluence) while in Brazil the underline still remained usual (maybe due to the delay in adopt new technologies and the lack of further typographical inffluences).</p>
<p>There is also two another variations in Brazilian Portuguese: (1) to use a dot under the ordinal. In this case, the dot is aligned with the baseline while the numeral is kept raised. And, less common, (2) to have underlined ordinal with a dot at the baseline. As computers did not offer an easy way to set ordinals in these traditional forms, the &ldquo;nude&rdquo; ªº became common and acceptable. But it is always nice to find fonts and publishers taking care of underlined ordinals.</p>
<p>In other hand, type designers interested in address these local issues (and who do not feel overburdened) could consider the problem regarding plurals. There is no easy way to write <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->os<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as ordinals, and they are quite common in Portuguese. One need to know about OT superiors, have a font with them and use an appplication with this feature. It would be very good to have fonts with an OT substitution command to change ªs and ºs to superiors when using Portuguese.</p>
<p>Not sure about how modern Spanish or Italian use this.</p>

That does mean variant encodings can result, but that&rsquo;s already the case. There are three different potential ways to encode numeral+ordinal sequences, and all of these are found in text, as Google searches in Portuguese attest:</p>
<p>2a 8o (simple letter, with or without superscript styling)
2ª 8º (ordinal characters)
2ᵃ 8ᵒ (modifier superior characters)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with charles ellertson&rsquo;s affirmation that it would be easier if the designers included those characters with the fonts.</p>
<p>As to Albert Jan Pool&rsquo;s affirmation, I get the point, but there are limits. German typewriters had an ß available for them. Every language or country has its idiosyncrasies. Whether it&rsquo;s a question of &ldquo;taste&rdquo;, &ldquo;design&rdquo;, you name it, I am of the opinion that neither &ldquo;design&rdquo; or readability (or legibility, I don&rsquo;t care about Anglo-Saxon preciosity carried too far away) apply here. It&rsquo;s just a matter of choice or &ldquo;norms&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If Spanish and Portuguese have a handwritten tradition of writing underlined ordinals, for me it would be logical that some culture-sensitive designer would just come up with a underlined as and os (with plurals), even if as an alternate set.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not actually required, it does look better &ndash; and surprisingly I&rsquo;m seeing more and more of it now that Calibri and Cambria are default in MS Word&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Abbreviations were always very common in Latin and a small horizontal stroke was used as an abbreviation mark in several situations. Initially, it was used to shorten &ldquo;que&rdquo; (that), which was wrote just as q, and to cut the suffixes -um and -am. Latter, it also marked vowel nasalization and originated the tilde.</p>
<p>Maybe this horizontal stroke was also used to clearly mark ª and º as abbreviations. This is just a speculation, I have no concrete data about it. Anyway, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese are the Latin-derivated languages with more resemblance to late Latin (while French, Romanian, Catalan and Provençal have a more distinct structure). Thus this idea makes some sense.</p>
<p>I tend to design № using the same criteria used to ª and º. But it seems the № used in Cyrillic is a bit different, with the stroke at the baseline (further info is very welcome on this).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, here in Portugal the abbreviations should always have a dot in front of the ordinal: 1.º; n.º; Prof.ª. However, 90 % of the Portuguese don&rsquo;t know this; even newspapers use Profª, or even Profª., with the dot behind, which is totally wrong. However, underlining them is not necessary, as established in the orthographic reform 1940 (<a href="http://www.ciberduvidas.pt/perguntas/get/345441)">http://www.ciberduvidas.pt/perguntas/get/345441)</a>. The Portuguese language does not only contain º and ª, but also other letters: (I will use modifier superior characters): L.ᵈᵃ; S.ᵗᵒ; Ex.ᵃˢ, etc. But these abbreviations are slowly disappearing, as all can be written in normal characters, and is still grammatically correct: Lda., Sto., Exmas. (note that the dot is indispensable). In fact, there’s no limit to the words which can be shortened like this; the rule is simply to write the beginning, put a dot, and write the end in superscript: Portugal: Port.ᵃᶫ (used on maps). Personally, I prefer using ordinals, and, if possible, underlined. But sometimes it does get a bit weird, like in the short form of sexta-feira (imagine a line under the superscript): 6.ª-feira. It looks very strange, especially if the underscore is on the same hight as the hyphen&hellip;</div>

<p>I think one should not forget that (IIRC) the overwhelming majority of № in Russian was in documents produced on typewritters.  So it is the typewriter fonts which one should examine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I had access to Russian typewriters, I would not have realized that different manufacturers may have used different fonts on them — for me all the typed documents looked the same.  And I have no clue how to find examples, e.g., Optima- or Erika-fonts nowadays.  (And [without consulting Wikipedia] I do not recollect any brand-name of Soviet typewriters — it could not have been that every one was German/Čech/etc…)</p>
<p>Anyway, all I remember is the №s with the tops of N and º aligned.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="http://katyn.ru/forums/viewtopic.php?id=422">http://katyn.ru/forums/viewtopic.php?id=422</a> discusses some changes in typewriter&rsquo;s fonts in 30s–40s.  I did not inspect the originals they discuss…</p>
<p>This [[http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%9F%D0%9F-305-01_%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0_%D1%81_%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8.JPG|Wikipedia image of a clone of Erika]] shows the keycap with № which matches what I discussed above.  But the actually produced symbol might have been different…</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update²:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> [[http://katynfiles.com/content/romanov-rp-1.html|these photocopies of 30s 40s]] illustrate a style of typewriter&rsquo;s № I mentioned above; but they also have the type with “_ aligned at bottom” on most (all?) of the letterheads, and one of the used typewriters also uses this style!</p>

<p>Actually, IIRC, all Erika⎖s I saw in Russia were with Cyrillic fonts.  In my office, there was a Latin Optima, and a couple of Cyrillic ones.</p>
