At Hrant's suggestion ( the full attibution of the suggestion : Matthew Carter ) I visted Copps Hill Cemetary after Typecon was over & took photos of the grave stones. Some of the letterforms are pretty keen. Interesting Ligatures. Tasty Numbers. Edward Gorey style skulls. Some Chris Lozos style letterforms too - Chris: care to comment? And even 'copperplate style' making it onto stone. The link above will take you to the Flickr Set. I have not added these images to the Typecon Flickr Stream.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eben, those are great. My family and I were there on Monday before TypeCon started. We missed the train to Concord and had some time to kill and walked up there. It turned out to be one of our favorite spots in Boston. I love how it's way up on top of a hill. Did you notice the "narrowest house in Boston" across the street?</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Looked up
I have to admit - I didn't.
That's very cool though. A picture to proove it too. How cool.
I went in the morning on a sunny day so I was either shooting into deep shadow or attemping to not create one - mostly shadow because the graves point north by enlarge. I recommend that a person go in the afternoon & on a cloudy day ideally speaking. Shooting in RAW format helped save these shots.
After I took them I was ravenous and so I went to eat oysters.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great photos Eben — thanks for sharing! I also went tombstone photographing in 3 little graveyards around the city. I managed to take about 60 great photos of the little images at the top of the stones and of borders and graphics. I was so enthralled with the imagery on the stones that I have started working on a dingbat font using them. It's called "Memento Mori".

<div class=commentbody>Eben,
I am a real sucker for letters carved in stone! I wish I had gone with you. Amazing images!
I did notice some creative ligatures and "f"s with no crossbar on the left. Is that what you meant?
The headstone marked "Eben" must have been eery for you though?

<div class=commentbody>Some of the letterform features are a result of the medium: slate, which is very brittle. But apparently it's also very weather-resistant and that's what makes New England headstones so special: they last for ages - so the letterforms are very old (in the case of Copps as old as the 17th century I think). So the disjoin in the bowl of many of the "g"s and that one-sided "f" are probably done to combat the brittleness. I also remember seeing a wonderful "B" with it's middle join not reaching the stem.
BTW, that last "i" is funny: it looks like the guy put a
placement mark for the tittle, but never actually made it.

<div class=commentbody>When they say something is "Set in STONE" they mean it. You don't have the luxury of going back and rekerning that YET grouping. They also had deadlines (excuse the pun). ;^D
Hrant, if ever you can get a chance, watch a stonecutting master craftsman at work. It is a thing of beauty but they make it look much easier than it is! I well butchered a piece of stone once trying and have more respect than ever for those old guys.

<div class=commentbody>I did once watch four of them: during ATypI-Rome in 2002.
Yes, it's impressive - and what I found most interesting was
how varied the styles of the different cutters were.
And I'd love to learn it, or at least try my hand.
I even have this dreamy idea of a personal style
that I might develop one day - based on the
Ancient Greek style of carving.

<div class=commentbody>> do the graves really point north?
They did seem to point north more ofthen than not. Lots of graves were opposite so they pointed south. There were fairly few east or west pointing ones. Pointing/facing north might make sense because it would reduce the number of freeze/thaw cycles the carving would be subjected to. Or there could have been another reason - like a desire to point towards water maybe. Mostly I metioned it by way of advice for future photographers because they might want sideways light - or more somewhat more diffuse light to help capture more detail. Hrant is right that a really cloudy day might give you dull looking images. Of course a light diffuser might help...</div>

<div class=commentbody>The "y ligature" is "ye" or "the".
More from the Oxford dictionary (on my Mac):
ye 2 |yē; ðē| adjective pseudo-archaic term for the : : Ye Olde Bookshoppe. ORIGIN graphic variant; in late Middle English þ (see thorn ) came to be written identically with y, so that the could be written ye. This spelling (usually y e) was kept as a convenient abbreviation in handwriting until the 19th cent., and in printers' types during the 15th and 16th cent., but it was never pronounced as “ye.”</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>As far as I know the "y" was subbed in for the thorn directly because the English started off by importing their type from Holland, and were too cheap/lazy to add proper sorts for the thorn. By the time Caslon started making type from scratch it was too late. And I think they initially used a vertically flipped "y", before no longer even bothering with that extra effort.
This is quite a prominent case of technology affecting script. If they had been as concerned with their culture as they were with the fast buck, the English script would probably still enjoy the richness and elegance of the thorn (and eth).

<div class=commentbody>I didn't make it to Copps Hill, but here are some other cemetery photos from the Granary and King's Chapel burying grounds. They are amazing to say the least. It would be easy to stay there for hours and examine each one because they are all so unique.

<div class=commentbody>Rob, very nice.
So can we get a list of such burial grounds
in New England, or at least the Boston are?

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, that "Park" gravestone completely boggles my mind! Why would someone go to all that trouble to carve out the basic same name??
I can almost see the conversation taking place:
"Did you hear that Mr. C. Park died?"
"Who??"
"You know, Mr. Park..."
"Oh! Mr. Park? That's terrible!"</div>
