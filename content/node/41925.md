  text a 'been printed' look where it has bled - I have tried several different approaches
  but haven't really been happy with any of them.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have some tips
  or know of a tutorial for Illustrator or Photoshop in bleeding stuff onscreen as
  if it was printed on paper?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nRafe"

  body: "Perhaps a far better way to explain it is by focussing on the differences
    between printing from metal and digitally - I am tired of everything printed from
    a digital source being so perfect, and just as the designer intended. With material
    printed on a press there is always an element whereby the work is just as it is,
    and whereby there is only so much control a designer can have over the final product;
    as such, material printed manually tends to have more personality. The imperfections
    and inconsistencies created when printing digitally are in general uninteresting
    and do not create any remarkable effects bar that of making the work seem substandard.\r\n\r\nHowever
    when printing stuff from metal, wood or whatever material takes your fancy with
    a manual printing press, you get interesting variations created from how the ink
    is spread over the surfaces, which paper you use, how firmly you apply the press,
    etc.\r\n\r\nI want to introduce this type of inconsistency to digital media, in
    an effort to create what I suppose you could call an 'accidentalism' - an effect
    or final appearance which was, to a certain extent, created by accident. Obviously
    the nature of digital layouts means such accidentalisms are almost impossible;
    thus I want to simulate it in Photoshop/Illustrator, starting with making stuff
    look like it has been printed on paper.\r\n\r\nThis is the start of a personal
    project I suppose; any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "There are several threads about OpenType and alternate characters used to
    make a handwriting font look more like handwriting. I suspect this method could
    be employed with any font to add subtle variation.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are are
    many ways to distress a font and add irregularity. One very basic approach is
    to rasterize the type, add noise, blur the image to soften/fatten the edges, convert
    to bitmap, then redraw using the curves.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that a distressed
    edge means more points. This could be a real issue in a book face, for example."
