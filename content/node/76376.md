  the end of the page of \"Adobe - better by you\" ( http://www.behance.net/gallery/Adobe-Better-by-You/56095
  ) \r\n there's a text \"THE \"BETTER BY YOU\" CONCEPT BRINGS A COMMUNITY-BASED WEB
  ENVIROMENT TO ADOBE.COM WHERE USERS CAN UPLOAD...\". The font used in this text
  is amazing for little details (something near from pixeldust) . I would love to
  know what is this font, i really need something like this, if you can help me."
