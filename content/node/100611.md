    work, it\u2019s still unlikely that the typeface was ever digitized.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the Oxford English Dictionary\u2014the Ultimate Authority\u2014spells these words
    in precisely the same way: \xABco\xF6peration\xBB, \xABf\u0153tal\xBB\u2014so,
    maybe it\u2019s not the dictionaries that are weird. Just sayin\u2019\u2026"
