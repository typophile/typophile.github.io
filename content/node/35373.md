  in the registered trademark/logo of her company. While on the one hand that sounds
  great, on the other I don't know if I need to issue some kind of very specific legal
  agreement protecting the font itself. There are any number of registered trademarks/logos
  that incorporate Helvetica, for example, and that doesn't prevent other people from
  using the font for other purposes. But do I need to  issue her some kind of specific
  license specifying that? Should I be charging her some kind of extra license fee?
  I'd be grateful for any input.\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  body: "Many foundries' basic license includes the right to make this sort of derivative
    work, i.e., to make a graphic image that includes the shapes of some glyphs in
    the font. If the license you issued does not, then yes, I think you are within
    your rights to offer that customer special dispensation for an additional fee,
    but this is widely regarded as being within the fair and expected uses of a font.\r\n\r\nDingbat,
    symbol, and picture fonts are generally the only ones that specifically disallow
    this, since the charactters are already basically logos in and of themselves.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I do defer to the opinions of those with more experience and expertise
    in this matter.\r\n\r\nIf this company is requesting exclusivity in the use of
    your font in logotypes, then this is indeed a very special case, which will require
    special licensing not only for this customer, but also denying this specific use
    for any other customers. It would be simpler to sell this client full corporate
    exclusivity (with the huge fee that should entail). But again, I'm not the expert
    here."
