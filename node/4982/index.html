  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello fellows,  <BR> <BR>there is another theater (opera actually) poster i am working on. It is the opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; by Gaetano Donizetti. <BR> <BR>The story (in a very shoet brief) is about the forbidden love (what else?) between two young aristocrates Edgardo and Lucia. Their families are deadly enemies, so Lucia's brother Enrico and leader of the family tricks Lucia into believing Edgardo unfaithful. Enrico insists Lucia to marry Lord Arturo Bucklaw. Edgardo disrupts the wedding and curses Lucia. After a lot of tragic events Lucia starts getting mad and she is &quot;abadoning&quot; herself in a way. Her personality is DECONSTRUCTED day by day. At the climax of this proceedure she kills Arturo on their wedning night. This deconstruction of herself leads her to death as the paranoia and her sorrow destroyed her will for life. <BR> <BR>So, that's the story and below are the proposals. I am looking forward for comments. <BR> <BR>Have a nice day, christos. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37008.gif" alt="a"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37009.gif" alt="b"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37010.gif" alt="c"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37011.gif" alt="d"></div>

C looks like somebody tore down the poster, and it was taped together. <BR> <BR>For D, the tiara (or whatever it is) is interfering with the legibility of the <i>Megaro</i> line. (And the spacing between the A and the R looks off, probably because of the background color).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agree with Ivan. Blood has it's appropriate place, in sample above it is used tastefully. I would however (being overly critical) move the blood tears a bit right so it is not as symetrical. <BR> <BR>Paths are a bit harsh and may look better if softened. Reversed face (only showing nose) facing right is a bit much, and should be reworked a bit to draw less attention. Idea is clever enough <BR>but subtlety goes a long way. <BR> <BR>overall the work is exceptional.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39048.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello kumbuniko <BR> <BR>you are right to be curious about this. <BR>I don't know how it works generaly but i will try to describe how it works with me: <BR> <BR>Being a professional -meaning that you make a living out of your work- makes you trying to sell your work. On this process a basic tool is to give a client the bigest variety of options you can. Of course this doesn't mean to show something you dislike only to have something more. But even if you have 2 things you like you can't like them equal.  <BR> <BR>There is a point when you stop creating and act as a viewer even in your own piece, and then you are as subjective are the rest viewers. There were times that i didn't like works of mine that have been chosen, but after an explanation of those who chose them i started liking them.  <BR> <BR>The thing is that even the creator sometimes cannot comprehence completely his work and a &quot;stranger&quot; can see more. So i believe is better to show also the work you &quot;don't believe&quot; so much, keeping always of course you quality line on a decent level. <BR> <BR>Hope i was understood (i am not so fluent in english as you can see). <BR> <BR>Have a nice day, christos</div>
