body: "Hi folks, here is another font ID puzzler (for me). The sender wasn't sure
  if the font was a serif or sans, although he thought sans would have been his preference.
  He created this over 5 years ago, apparently with some fonts from his System folder
  (assuming PC). He said he didn't buy (or download) any extra fonts, but his 'Fireworks'
  application uses System fonts, and doesn't come with its own fonts.\r\n\r\nI have
  never seen (as far as I can recall) an italic with such a long tail on it. Modern
  and Century only begin to approximate it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  Thanks."

    Handwriting</a> -- but the <em>o</em> and the <em>a</em> are from another font,
    so we're only halfway there. :-/

  body: "Thanks Yves -- Good work, you got them both. Of course I wouldn't look in
    'scripts', because he told me it was a text font! \r\n\r\n(not sure how I created
    the dual thread. I wrote the post, uploaded the image, previewed it,  and said
    'submit'. )\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi there.  Mike sent me this way as I'm the evil person responsible for this
    puzzler!  Just wanted to say thanks for the help, especially working out that
    there were two fonts involved.  That never occurred to me!\r\n\r\nNot sure what
    the difference between 'text' fonts and 'script' fonts are, but hopefully I'll
    learn over the course of time...\r\n\r\nPS I'm on a Mac nowadays and try to avoid
    MS fonts as much as possible!"
