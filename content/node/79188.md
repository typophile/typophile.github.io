  and found that you're a very helpful bunch...so here's a question from me.\r\n\r\nI'm
  involved in the production of a film titled \"The Waiting Room\" part of which is
  set on a British railway station during the Great War (1914-1918). The film investigates
  the paranormal and the original type for the title had a ghostly feel, however the
  Director would now like to use something a little less ghostly and use something
  which reflects the period more appropriately.\r\n\r\nNow if there is a specific
  typeface for railway stations of the period that would be terrific...unless it was
  too modern! I get the feeling that an audience for this film would expect a serif
  type of some description. What's more the railway station would probably have been
  built in the late Victorian or Edwardian period and not repainted and updated with
  new signage for a while.\r\n\r\nSo expectations are more important than accuracy.
  One final thing, whatever font is chosen needs to be readily and cheaply available...the
  movie budget disappeared on hiring a steam train!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nIan"

  body: British railway signage of this period would most likely be a sans, or with
    very small copperplate-style serifs, , but hand-lettered. Greater Albion's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/chipperly/|Chipperly]]
    is based on Edwardian railway lettering and is cheap. Jim Parkinson's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/|Modesto]]
    has some weights that would be good too.

    at Johnston (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_%28typeface%29), otherwise
    Gill Sans.

  body: "The Smith lettering is really quite elegant; I prefer Paul Shaw's Cresci
    and Pontif to Facia.\r\n\r\nThe WH Smith story is fascinating.\r\nAmong other
    accomplishments, Smiths was arguably the first advertising agency, designing and
    selling poster campaigns nationwide in railway stations in the 1850s.\r\nSmith's
    1905 corporate identity (at a time when such things were only just emerging) was
    strongly informed by St. John Hornby's (their managing director) work as a private
    press printer \u2014 a hobbyist, but much respected. The lettering was Gill's
    first public success, at age 23.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashendene_Press\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/First-News-Smith-Charles-Wilson/dp/0224021567/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_5"
