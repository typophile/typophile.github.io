  body: It&#39;s an old typeface called Abbott Oldstyle. Digital versions include
    Softmaker&#39;s version by that same name, Abbess by Fontbank and Mandrita Display
    by SSi. All are surely find-able via Google search.

    Here&#39;s Abbess.</a> <BR> <BR>Absolutely no guarantee of quality on any of the
    three fonts I mentioned, BTW.

    is a random example. &#40;No <BR>guarantees of legality of course, but it&#39;s
    not <BR><i>obviously</i> dodgy.&#41;
