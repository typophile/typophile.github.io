  body: It's probably a Caslon of some kind.

  body: I looked through all the caslon's at myfonts and none matched. The A serif
    is more pronounced than any caslon's I saw.

  body: "Do you have any other letters?  The <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> can be helpful as a tool, but Key U.C. letters it uses are E,
    J, K, M, R, U and W, and your sample has only the R.(And it's a somewhat ambiguous
    R style, unfortunately.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The closest I could find was <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/imprint/\">Imprint</a>,
    and the R leg seems slightly off, and the stress is less slanted. It would help
    to narrow the search with some more Key letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I'm thinking it's Imprint Shadow, but filled in manually. Adding to my confidence
    in that is the fact that Imprint Shadow came with my Windows but Imprint itself
    didn't, so whoever designed this is more likely to have had Imprint Shadow.

  body: Imprint is the winner. Amazing how without the inline shapes it stumped me.
    I knew I had seen that A somewhere
