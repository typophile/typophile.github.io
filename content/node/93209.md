    if this has been reported and if there's a fix already.

  body: FontForge is a great program for font design if you can get it running. That's
    the hard part. You should subscribe to the Devel and User mailing lists mentioned
    on the FontForge website, and ask your questions there, with as much detail as
    you are able. There are people there much more skilled than I am who can help.

  body: "Thanks Karl. MacPorts did the trick, I have it running now.\r\n\r\nFor the
    record (and if anyone else wants to know how to install fontforge on a Mac):\r\n\r\n1.
    Download a MacPorts Package Installer from http://www.macports.org/install.php\r\n2.
    Download Xcode from the App Store or https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\r\n3.
    Once Xcode is installed, open it. Open Preferences and click the Downloads tab.
    Click \"Install\" next to \"Command Line Tools\".\r\n4. Once that is installed,
    open Terminal and type:\r\n\r\nsudo port install fontforge\r\n\r\n5. Once fontforge
    has installed, you will find it in the MacPorts folder in Applications. Open it.\r\n6.
    In the menu bar, click X11 and open Preferences. Click Pasteboard. Deselect 'Enable
    Syncing'\r\n\r\nAnd hopefully that will do the trick."

    (10.7.3) using MacPorts and had it up and running within a couple of hours.

  body: I made a mistake of installing Fink, Macports, and Homebrew and trying to
    install Fontforge with all of them. Now my computer is full of these libraries
    that I can't find and Homebrew is refusing to work. How can I make a fresh start
    of this without reformatting my hard drive?

    to get rid of Macports completely, the following instructions should do the job:
    http://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.uninstalling ; for Fink <PRE>\r\n
    \ sudo rm -fr /sw\r\n</PRE>\r\n should be enough (In fact, for Macports, <code>sudo
    rm -fr /opt</code> should already solve your problems).\r\n\r\n"

    the FontForge Formula isn't complete enough, dependency wise.\r\nThe lastest Formula

    to install that one, you're probably better off installing the binary package."

    Linux. The 64 bit disk image didn't work so I'm downloading the 32 bit version
    now. Then we'll see if that works and I can use FontForge again.

  body: I've successfully made my Mac a dual-boot Snow Leopard/Precise Pangolin iMac.
    The Ubuntu Software Center offers a build of FontForge, but it is based on the
    horribly outdated and buggy tarball from February 2011. It works so long as you
    don't invoke Expand Stroke. I've not yet succeeded in attempts to build FontForge
    from the git repository source.

  body: "There should be no need to make your Mac dual-boot or to use MacPorts in
    order to install FontForge\u2014in fact, I recommend pretty strongly against both
    of these. MacPorts installations are really awful to maintain (I've done it\u2014never
    again, I hope); Homebrew is much nicer to work with. Don't give up on it because
    of a faulty formula.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it looks like there was an error in
    the Homebrew formula for FontForge. That error appears to have been fixed since
    the original post; <code>brew install fontforge</code> was able to properly interpret
    the formula and start building when I tried it just now.\r\n\r\nSummary: I'd recommend
    Homebrew as the best way to install FontForge on Mac OS X today.\r\n\r\nAs for
    dual-booting, if you <em>really</em> need an Ubuntu environment (which is unlikely),
    using VirtualBox or similar to set up a VM will be more convenient, because you
    won't need to reboot every time you want to use the other OS. "

  body: One other thing worth knowing. <code>brew install fontforge</code> will, by
    default, install only the command-line components, which are great for doing things
    like programmatic font conversion, but pretty sucky for actually making fonts.
    :) If you want to actually run the GUI, you'll need to do <code>brew install fontforge
    --with-x</code> .
