  at the top of this ring and jewellery website ( i've attached the image)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Warren-James-Logo_white_6195.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
  a tall slim sans serif font but I can't seem to find a perfect match to it. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso
  does anyone know what font is used for the 'buy now' and 'add to wishlist' buttons
  on their product pages? Example below\r\nhttp://www.warrenjames.co.uk/jewellery/mens-titanium-band-ring-TITA001"
