body: "Hello,\r\nhoping someone can help.\r\nI am setting out a brochure and have
  text that flows over a number of pages, the text also wraps around a number of images.
  Everything was fine until I reopen my file this morning and now only one part of
  the text has some weird formatting. \r\nWhat is weird is that a few line are a different
  size from the rest of the text. Checking the size by highlighting it tells me it
  is 10 point but looking at it, in both high quality an as a press pdf, I can see
  that it is not (the surrounding body text is all set at 10 point). I have recreated
  the paragraph styles as well as deleting the text frame that it is in, but it still
  has this weird formatting.\r\nIts bugging the hell out me. \r\nAttached below is
  a screen cap to illustrate.\r\nAny suggestion or do I have to start this layout
  all over again?"

  body: You have checked the justification settings? If the default settings are 'strange'
    then your new paragraph styles will inherit them. It looks like both letter scaling
    and glyph scaling is set to something silly.

  body: "Try this:\r\nExport the document in InDesign Interchange Format (it's under
    Export \u2014 a pop up).\r\nNext: open the resulting document. InDesign will rebuild
    it. (Quite a few corrupt ID-docs can be saved this way.)\r\n\r\nIf this does not
    work, try erasing font caches (use a tool like FontFinagler \u2014 I assume you're
    on a Mac).\r\n\r\n___\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Well OK, \r\ntried all the suggestion no luck, I then changed from ITC Avant
    Garde to Helvetica then the Avenir and well the problem went away. \r\nIt seems
    the problem is with Avant Garde, but only in this specific place in the text,
    not in any other part, which I find really strange, so it looks like I'll have
    to rebuild the layout and hope it doesn't happen again, I just wish I new why
    it was happening!\r\nThanks for the suggestions :-)\r\nMartin"
