  logo. It reminds me of Optima but the counter in the D is nice and soft and the
  R is curvier  - can you tell I'm new to this ; )\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    by Jeremy Dooley, but it lacks the graceful shape to the letters, especially the
    R. I suspect that this is custom lettering, but it might be possible to edit out
    the serifs from a classic serif face and achieve something similar, brutal as
    that sounds.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Garamond Premier]], I think what you would have left would be very close to this
    lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: 'Hey Mike, thank you so much.. Its always fun trawling for typefaces but I''d
    hit a brick wall. Yeah, you''re right, the Premier Ds would match - well spotted,
    I''d have never seen that. I''ll have a play : )'
