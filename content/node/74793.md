  body: "wow i feel like i am like so close but yet so far... anyways i see it as
    being mostly Antiqua.. until i get to the serifs where they have a slight slant..
    http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antiqua/\r\n\r\nthen i have a font that has the
    slants... http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/americana/extra-bold/\r\nbut lacks
    certain aspects as well... \r\n\r\nmaybe it will be a good starting point for
    someone though "
