body: "Hi, Some of you know me from the Type ID Board, and may know that I recently
  (finally) stuck my typographic toes from the familiar comfort of Mac OS 9.2 into
  the unfamiliar, but inviting waters of OS X. Of course, my Mac being old, my OS
  X software was what I got on CD and is version 10.1.5. I found that if I wanted
  the newer versions I would have to have DVD capability, so here I am in the OS X
  that no one uses, and reading the discussions of Font Explorer X (which requires
  10.3.9, or something similarly distant from my version).\r\n\r\nOK, that's not an
  option. So what can I do to have some sort of Font Managment? I had been spoiled
  in OS 9.2 with Adobe's ATM Deluxe. Now I can't use anything unless I move it to
  the OS X Fonts folder. So far it's been easier to restart back in OS 9, make my
  graphics and then drop them off where I can pick them up agin in OS X.\r\n\r\nThat
  can't be the easy way to do things.  What can you suggest besides telling me to
  get a new computer?\r\n\r\nThanks for helping the 'lame' to walk in a new environment.

    10.4 the first one to come out on DVD only (in the box)? The newer versions should
    also be faster."

  body: "Another option is to use an iBook/MacBook , connect it to your mac with a
    firewire cable and use it in \"target mode\" to install a current OSX.  \r\n\r\nThat
    of course depends on your older mac having firewire. With all that said, you may
    need to check the specs to see if your computer even meets the bare specs to adequately
    run 10.4.  Although you don't want to hear it, I'd suggest even a MacMini for
    $600 (+$100 for 1Gb ram) that is going to give you a current OS, a DVD drive and,
    most likely, a faster machine overall. Plus you'll get to use FontExplorer."

    aliases of the destination folder (in my case, Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts
    because I don't want/need fonts to be available in MS and other apps) and your
    fonts folder.\r\n\r\nDrag between them as required. Crude (perhaps, although I
    prefer \"simple\") but effective."

    painful to deal with. I will have to look into getting newer versions on CD. I
    couldn't find them selling anything but the newest OS X versions, at least at
    first glance, although I admit my focus was on getting used to this version, which
    can run on my G3. Not sure which newer ones need a G4 as the minimum.\r\n\r\n-

    up. I loved my G3 and OS 9.2.2 but you might want to get beyond that. It won't
    improve your typography a whit but it sure makes life easier on the net.\r\n\r\nOS
    10.1 wasn't so good. You probably want to get to at least 10.3.9. Other World
    Computing (great place) has some kind of emulator software (X PostFacto) that
    supposedly allows you to run Panther and even Tiger on a G3. But you might also
    want to/need to soup up that G3 with a faster processor, maybe a video card, updated
    hard drive controller card, UBS/Firewire card, etc., to get it to even basement
    level performance. \r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n"

    my version of the OS, so it doesn't seem to be an option.\r\n\r\nGerald, I know
    getting the new stuff would make life easier, but the benefits don't justify the
    cost, and the hassle of transitioning to a new machine. \r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe
    with my old system was not being able to post images here after the Typophile
    'upgrade' (I can't get past feeling the need for quotations -- sorry, all you
    folks who were so proud of the changes, and worked so hard on them), but wwith
    my 'mini-upgrade' I can do it now, once again.\r\n\r\nSo I'm happy enough with
    the way things are working, it's just the font management that seems to be a lot
    more tedious than it was with ATM deluxe.  With all the things I do with the large
    font collection I have accumulated, that's not a trivial matter, but it sounds
    like I just need to get used to it, until I am ready to bite the new Mac bullet.\r\n\r\n-

      like being stuck on dial-up when the rest of the world is on broadband. I think
      a year ago you could almost manage. I bet a year from now the experience will
      be nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nSticking with an older setup is a tough argument
      to make if your livelihood depends on the tools you use.  A G3 Powermac is at
      least eight year old technology, and OSX 10.1 is five year old technology. The
      limitations and cost involved trying to bring an older system to run current
      applications has got to have diminishing returns. There's a reason G3 Powermacs
      sell for less than $50 on eBay. The newer and upcoming software is only going
      to be more and more incompatible with that older machine.  Whether it's font
      management tools, browsers and RSS - there's worthwhile stuff that just won't
      be available. \r\n \r\nTransitioning to a new machine is getting pretty simple
      with Apple's install Migration Assistant.  Getting all your files organized
      and apps reloaded depends on how organized you are. \r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    if I <em>were</em> in that situation you'd be completely right (and I would probably
    have already done it long ago), but I've been retired from my career for over
    7 years. This is what I do for fun these days, and my simple, low-tech web site
    and my label printing business sideline does just fine with my antique setup,
    as long as it is still running. When it goes belly-up, I get a new(er) machine,
    and load my fonts on it and off I go.\r\n\r\nTiffany, I might just take you up
    on that offer. Can you e-mail me the details?  Thanks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, one thing to consider is upgrading to an older Mac. If you look at
    Apple's system requirements page for Tiger (10.4) you'll see it runs on some pretty
    old iron, some models going back over five years. A few of them don't have DVD
    drives, but most do. The biggest issue with older Macs running newer software
    is hard drive space and memory, but both can be upgraded relatively cheaply.\r\n\r\nLots
    of resources on the <a href=\"http://lowendmac.com/\">Low End Mac</a> site for
    running older Mac hardware (including which old Macs are the best value)."

  body: "This thread has made me nostalgic for some of the early, \"bad old days\"
    of Mac OS X. I actually tried out 10.0 and waited patiently for the (free) upgrade
    to 10.1 which Apple distributed on CD. Each version from 10.0 through at least
    10.3 exhibited real performance improvements. It was one of the only times I can
    think of when OS updates actually made things *faster*. With 10.4, features like
    Spotlight and Dashboard probably eat up some resources to overshadow any optimizations.
    For an older Mac, I think installing 10.3 off CD would be reasonable. If I remember
    correctly, it takes two CDs. The current state of the art software(FontLab 5,
    CS 2) will be compatible, and the next generation (like Adobe CS 3) will probably
    have hardware requirements such that it would never run on your old system anyway.
    \r\n\r\nFor a lot of professionals, the trick is to wait long enough for any major
    issues to be worked out with new versions, but stay current enough that you don't
    get left behind as support drops off for older products. "

  body: "Mark, I really appreciated your input on this, because that's a route I can
    more easily rationalize in my situation. Thanks for that link. I have already
    added a bigger hard drive (I'm using maybe 20% of the 80GB drive after 6 years)
    and maxxed my RAM (to 768MB), so that they have usually been more than adequate
    for what I do. I am patient enough for a slower processor to do something in 10
    seconds instead of 2. What was killing me was the browsers I could use couldn't
    keep up with the new web page features.\r\n\r\nCarl, Your comments were also quite
    useful. The OS X upgrade rush has stunned me with it's quick rate of change (read
    'instability', in my mind), and I kept waiting for some sort of equilibrium to
    be reached at a 'plateau system', like OS 9 was. Your last sentence is the key
    to where I found myself (left behind), so I have made the step into the OS X system,
    and it sounds like 10.3, if it runs on my machine would be the way to upgrade.\r\n\r\nI
    knew I could get some help if I asked here. Thanks to all of you for responding.\r\n\r\n
