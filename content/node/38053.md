  Sans</a> by Elsner + Flake.\r\n\r\nThere are three different variants of the family
  available on myfonts...\r\n\r\nEFOP\r\nEFCEOP\r\nEFTUOP\r\n\r\nThey are all the
  same price... I am guessing the EFCEOP version has central euro figures, but I haven't
  a clue what the EFTUOP family variant could be.\r\n\r\nAre they all exclusive character
  sets, or is there one of these that contains all of the others? I expect that by
  buying the EFOP version I'll be wasting my money?\r\n\r\nAny help/advise much appreciated.\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "Mmmh \u2026\r\nEF stands for Elsner+Flake, that\u2019s obvious.\r\nOn their
    website I found <a href=\"https://ssl.kundenserver.de/www.elsner-flake-shop.com/sess/utn1547110a92a19c2/shopdata/index.shopscript\">this</a>:\r\n<cite>Abbreviations
    in connection with the font name are:\r\nCE (Centraleuropean), T (Turkish), B
    (Bodysize up to 16pt), H (Headline from 16pt).</cite>\r\n\r\nand <a href=\"https://ssl.kundenserver.de/www.elsner-flake-shop.com/sess/utn1547110a92a19c2/shopdata//pdf/pdf_en/Layouts.zip\">that</a>:\r\n<cite>Enclosed
    font layouts show the basic character sets. In the Elsner+Flake\r\nDigital Library,
    it is distinguished between different layouts.\r\n1. Text layout with tabular
    figures\r\n2. Text layout (OsF) with old style figures instead of tabular figures\r\n3.
    Text layout (SC) with small caps instead of lower case characters and\r\nold style
    figures instead of tabular figures\r\n4. Headline layout\r\n5. Display layout\r\n6.
    Text layout Central European (CE) with tabular figures\r\n7. Text layout Turkish
    (T) with tabular figures</cite>\r\n\r\nThe combined abbrevations on MyFonts aren\u2019t
    covered by that 1:1, but my guess is: \r\nCE is Central European, TU is Turkish.
    OP is for OpenType.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "Ohh my bad... it's right there on their products page... Looks like the basic
    version is the West Euro set, with Euro symbol etc. I'll go for that one I think!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for taking the trouble to look into that - now I feel lazy :/\r\n\r\nI must persevere!"
