  1.3 on CD there. It's appearently a full version, though you need to go to a special
  website and get your serial code from there. Fair enough, but when i log in onto
  that website I get information that i am not authorised to access it. Is there any
  catch there? Or is there any other way of retrieving that serial no.?\r\n\r\ncheers
  for any help\r\n\r\n"

    I'd try getting in touch with them, they have been able to help me in the past.\r\nTim"
