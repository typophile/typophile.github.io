body: "Something pretty cool, FontShaker (3d font discovery tool) now feed design
  news directly into their UI and the twist is they allow the stories to be viewed
  using any font installed on your machine, or any of the fonts in their commercial
  database. \r\n\r\nSimply click a font card, zoom in, then click \u201Clive view\u201D
  you will see what I mean (link located on the right corner of the card). The only
  downside is they don\u2019t have Typophile's feed in there (yet) ;)\r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.typedna.com/fontshaker\r\n\r\n"
