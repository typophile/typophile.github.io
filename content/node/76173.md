  am considering joining a specialisation course on type design. The first course
  of this characteristics ever done in Spain. I have always been passionate about
  typography, and I have already done short courses on calligraphy, font design and
  that kind of stuff. \r\nWith all due respect to every fantastic font designer around
  the world, I am rather concerned about the need of new fonts. From my point of view,
  there ir a huge range of good fonts in every category.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nHave
  a nice day!\r\n\r\nYago"

    hundredth of an inch. That's a mighty lot of wiggle room that allows for considerable
    variation even within a single inch.\r\nToday much reading is done on screens
    of various kinds - a new kind of of ink and paper, essentially - which demands
    a fresh look at font design and font technology.\r\nSo the answer is yes, IMHO.\r\nBut
    it somewhat depends upon what you would consider \"new\". Many, perhaps most,
    typefaces are derived from others."

  body: "\r\nDoes the world need new kinds of nails? The nail was old technology in
    Biblical times, but there are still people who make their living by designing
    new kinds of nails and nail delivery systems. \r\n\r\nA shirt is a shirt, but
    every year clothing manufacturers come out with new shirt designs, and for some
    reason people go out and buy them, not just because their old ones are worn out
    but also because the new ones are different from last year's shirts.\r\n\r\nSo,
    do we need new font designs? Mostly not, but because of technological changes,
    every now and then we actually do.\r\n\r\nCan we use new type designs? Sure, why
    not.\r\n"

  body: "Here are my thoughts on the subject. let me know if I'm wrong. Whether you
    like it or not, I think there will always be an element of fashion in any type
    of design. Just as the common idea of how someone should look has changed over
    time, the idea of what type should look like changes. Both of these examples change
    over a relative long period of time, whereas for example the fashion in clothing
    changes much faster. Because the fashion for type changes slower than for clothing,
    you might argue that fewer typefaces per timespan are needed than clothing, which,
    I guess, is the case. Instead of saying that the fashion in type takes longer
    to change, you might also say that it just changes less in the same timespan.
    The old versions of Caslon look out of balance to me, while William's Clason is
    IMO adapted to the present day fashion. Although these changes might not be noticable
    in a year, they are there. This means that there will never be a limit to new
    typefaces. Apart from the above there is also the issue of changing technolgies
    and the countless different situations in which type is needed. These situations
    also include the different kind of looks brands want to have for their typefaces.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps convincing you. Don't stop designing type!"

  body: New typefaces are driven by changes in technology and culture. These changes
    are mitigated by the requirement of social continuity wherein each social environment
    has its own boundaries of allowable variance. As long as there is change in technology
    and culture, and until there is a universal, monolithic social environment, there
    will be new typefaces.
