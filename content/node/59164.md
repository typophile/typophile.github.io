  site \r\n\r\nwww.worldchanging.com\r\n\r\n\r\nheres the book cover\r\n\r\nhttp://magmabooks.com/images/small/4602.gif\r\n\r\nand
  heres a screenshot\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe stefan sagmeister designed the book.  It
  looks like a lot of his type work.  Especially the \"things I've learned in my life
  so far book\"\r\n\r\nhttp://thingsihavelearnedinmylife.com/\r\n\r\nActually the
  latter looks a bit like din, mixed with something else.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that before. I think the best we could come up with was that it\u2019s a customized
    Lutz Headline from <a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Headline+Fonts/Lutz+Headline/\">lineto</a>."

  body: Thanks Jan, I figured it was a customized type, especially since on the book
    jacket itself (if I remember correctly)it looks like he stretched some of the
    letters horizontally and such.
