  new typeface <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/aeronaut/\">Aeronaut</a>
  is like [[Blackletter]] meets Steampunk. Can't readily think of a use for this,
  but that won't stop me from admiring it."

  body: I'm thinking it must be from a historic source. There are at least 2 other
    blackletters that are like it on MyFonts with some very minor details that vary.
    None of them mention a source.

  body: "I recently used Aeronaut on a small project that called for a futuristic
    Victorian feel (think Tim Burton style without the darkness). Used it alongside
    Knockout. Very nice!\r\n\r\nI was compelled to adjust the <em>f</em> and <em>y</em>
    after converting a title to outlines. (See \"fly\" in the preview above).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
