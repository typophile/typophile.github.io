  body: well, if the family was OpenType, yes, there is some way to active long s
    depending of the language restrictions. Le Monde Livre Classic OT &#40;OT done
    by John Hudson to demonstrate some OT features back in 2001&#41; use this fonction.
    <BR> <BR>Sabon Next LT to date still only PostScript and TrueType. But all glyphs
    have been designed to built a future OT version. Its up to Linotype to do it I
    think.

  body: The use of the long s in German, like several other aspects of German typography,
    is pretty much impossible to automate without a dictionary. It is possible with
    OpenType to provide basic contextual handling of the long s, and to use Language
    System tags to vary the handling for different typographic traditions, but German
    has too many lexically-determined exceptions to a general rule.

  body: I think the &#60;hlig&#62; feature may be redundant. If a user wants the long
    s, he probably wants the ligatures associated with it that are appropriate for
    his language, so I would use the &#60;hist&#62; feature to substitute the long
    s, using contextual lookups for those languages that have rules about where the
    substitution may occur, and then the &#60;liga&#62; feature for any ligatures.
    The only reason I can think of for the &#60;hlig&#62; feature is if you wanted
    users to be able to turn the long s ligatures off without affecting other ligatures.
    Frankly, though, I don&#39;t expect to see the &#60;hlig&#62; feature supported
    any time soon, at least not with its own UI function, which is what it would need
    to make it at all useful. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what all the rules are for
    the long s in German, so I can&#39;t say what would be the best way to approach
    this.

  body: Spell-checkers are character-based and don&#39;t know anything about glyph-level
    processing. Theoretically, a dictionary-driven German typesetting system could
    be developed -- John Butler and I have mused about this in the past --, but nothing
    even close exists, to my knowledge.

  body: I have to agree with John that the long-s ligatures belong in either &#39;liga&#39;
    or &#39;dlig&#39; and there&#39;s no need for a separate &#39;hlig&#39; feature.
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the one downside of having spec&#39;d a whole ton of features
    before building fonts and apps to support them. We made a couple of mistakes.
    That was one of them. &#40;Also, anybody remember the &#39;crcy&#39; currency

    <BR>Andreas: <BR> <BR>Sure, the long_s is a historic thing. So use the &#39;hist&#39;
    feature if you like to get the glyph in there. But once you&#39;ve got it in text,
    there&#39;s no need for a &#42;special&#42; ligature feature with it. Any long_s
    ligatures you either want on by default &#40;liga&#41;, or off by default &#40;dlig&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Put another way, if every substitution feature were to need a separate
    corresponding ligature feature, we&#39;d need an amazingly large number of ligature
    features. <BR> <BR>But luckily for us, features are cumulative. Whether it&#39;s
    swashes or small caps or historical forms, they can interact with the main ligature
    features &#40;liga, dlig, clig&#41; to create just about any combination effect
    needed. <BR> <BR>T'
