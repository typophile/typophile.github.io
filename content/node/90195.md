body: "GLC Foundry\" is a French little foundry starting from 2008.\r\nIts purpose
  is to set up historic fonts inspired from dated, real and definite documents, or
  inspired by incomplete ones or by accurate style.\r\nFonts are complemented to allow
  a contemporary use, with accented characters and those mainly inexistent in early
  fonts. We make an effort to add abbreviations, ligatures, contracted letters and
  so on, peculiar to each concerned period. Punctuation signs are always reproduced
  in their original faces. We have a strong attachment to always keep the existent
  poetic imperfections of the models.\r\n\r\nGilles Le Corre was born in 1950 in Nantes,
  France. A painter since the end of 70s, he is also an engraver and calligrapher.
  He has been learning about medieval art and old books for as long as he can remember.
  More recently he has made the computer a tool for writing like the quill pen and
  ink. With it, he aims to make it possible to print books that look just like old
  ones! Beginning in 2007 he has been trying to reproduce, very exactly, a wide range
  of historic European typefaces, mainly from medieval and early periods of printing
  - his favorite period - from 1456 with Gutenberg, up to 1913 with a font inspired
  by a real old typewriter."
