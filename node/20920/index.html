<p>I believe Adobe was trying to overcome this problem when they decided to use [[PUA]]&rsquo;s in their fonts*. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be able to get any character into Word unless it has an [[Unicode]] value associated with it.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s one option. I believe there are other out there. It will depend on the kind of work you do and how you need to output it. A simple word processing application is fine for office-like documents, but not for heavy-graphical documents that need to be offset printed.</p>

<p>Mac Office is actually a separate group with Microsoft, and deserve a bit more slack than the Windows Office group on the subject of OpenType Layout support because they have not had the system infrastructure sitting at their fingertips for years.</p>
<p>If I were a betting man, I might put money on Mac Office delivering OTL typography support before Windows Office at the current rates of non-motion from the latter.</p>

<p>Check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mellel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know how good their OTL support for Latin script typography is, but I&rsquo;ve been impressed by their complex script support. You could also look around for any Mac apps that make use of IBM&rsquo;s ICU library, which provides open source support for OpenType Layout.</p>

<p>The OTL features implemented in Windows Office are all language shaping features, i.e. features that are active by default for the script and are not considered discretionary. Such features are also implemented for the Latin script, e.g. the ccmp and mark positioning features. What Office do not support, for any script, are features that require user interface.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>First, there is the problem of user interface. The linguistic OTL features usually are supposed to &ldquo;just work&rdquo; while for user-controlled OTL features you need decent UI. If you look at Adobe&rsquo;s inconsistent solutions between Illustrator (OpenType, Character and Glyph palettes), InDesign (Character and Glyph palette but no OpenType palette), and Photoshop (only Character palette), you&rsquo;ll realize that it&rsquo;s not at all trivial.</p>
<p>Second, there is the issue of backwards-compatibility in line-breaking. For Arabic or Indic scripts, there was constant improvement across Office versions (97, 2000, XP, 2003, 2007) which, however, often resulted in text reflow when you open the same document in different editors. In this case, the advantage of having ortographically more correct handling of the scripts was valued higher than the disadvantage of reflow.</p>
<p>But for simple scripts, the Office team aimed for consistent line- and page-breaks in Word across versions. If at some point, you get ligatures and different kerning (GPOS-sourced class kerning vs. traditional plain kerning which usually is a subset of the earlier), your documents will certainly reflow. Apparently, the advantage of having typographic refinement has not yet outweighed the reflow risk in the Microsoft Office team members' heads.</p>

<p>Probably. This seems to be more or less an industry-standard for new fonts. I have a feeling (and I&rsquo;m sorry that this is no consolation for you) that most font users who specifically want to set advanced typographic features do their typesetting virtually soley in Quark, InDesign, or Illustrator.</p>

Let&rsquo;s face it, what can you expect from a word-processing application that does not have kerning ON by default?!? Well, maybe they&rsquo;re right and we&rsquo;re ones wrong here. Maybe you need to stick to a layout application instead&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am very proud of Bill Gates for his new charity priority. It seems to me that his wife had something to do with it.  Soon after their wedding, I noticed a big jump in charitable work for Bill. Kudos to Mrs. Gates, a good women with a good heart. Kudos to Bill for recognizing her qualities and listening to her.
Maybe, Saturday nights, she is the one who also tells Bill to make that call about ligature support :-)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Word Processing/design needs&rdquo;</p>
<p>is an oxymoron. Do your word processing in Word, since it&rsquo;s made (ostensibly) for that, then, when that&rsquo;s done, take the plain text and format it in InDesign, Quark, Illustrator, or some other software that&rsquo;s made to handle OpenType. If you need typographic features available while you type, then just use InDesign or Quark.</p>

<p>Mellel turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Kerning seems to be on by default, it has automatic ligatures - dicretionary and others, auto swashes, historical forms/ligatures, auto small caps, you name it. It recognizes <em>most</em> of Musee&rsquo;s OT features, not all (i.e., a number of swashes), but until I get InDesign this will do very nicely. A great value at around 40-50 bucks, too. Well worth checking out.</p>
<p>Another one that more or less did justice to Musee&rsquo;s beauty is Nisus Writer Express. I&rsquo;m not sure about its kerning capabilities, though, seemed a bit shaky to me.</p>
<p>In any case, Mellel is far better than MS Office when it comes to taking advantage of OT features such as are in Musee.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, but there&rsquo;s no need. Mellel has auto-opentype features. I can &ldquo;ligaturize&rdquo; a whole block of text by selecting it and simply acticvating ligatures from the appropriate menu. Same goes for small caps, swashes and the like. I&rsquo;ll be picking up a copy of InDesign as well, and that does what Mellel does, and <em>much</em> more besides.</p>
<p>Finally, I can use OpenType fonts the way they were intended.</p>

<p>Which is exactly what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look at Adobe’s inconsistent 
solutions between Illustrator (OpenType, 
Character and Glyph palettes), InDesign 
(Character and Glyph palette but no 
OpenType palette), and Photoshop 
(only Character palette), you’ll 
realize that it’s not at all trivial.</p>
