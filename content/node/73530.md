  but the \"A\" definitely has the open crossbar.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    a better title was used, like \"MASCIO'S serif?\"\r\n\r\nCome on, folks, please
    TRY to think of a unique title for your posts. The people trying to help you can
    never find them again, if they all say some form of \"Help ID this typeface\".\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Just to further pursue my rant on the topic, there are currently 13 out of
    48 threads, which is more than 1/4 of them on the first page of this Forum, with
    some variation of \"Help ID this font\". There is no information about what style
    of font it is (serif, script, sans, cartoon, brush, etc), there is no mention
    of where it's from, and there is no identifying word (or words) from the sample
    itself.\r\n\r\nSure, you can find your own thread, because it has your name on
    it, but do you expect us to remember who asks each question?\r\n\r\nIf you are
    guilty of this form of Volunteer Abuse, you can go and edit your own subject line
    to make it easier to find them a few hours or days later, when we stumble across
    the answer, but can't figure out which \"Please ID this\" we were working on.\r\n\r\nI
    wish there was a way for the thread input form to reject a post without a descriptive
    title, or maybe flash a giant reminder: \"DOES YOUR TITLE MENTION SOMETHING SPECIFIC
    ABOUT DETAILS OF YOUR SAMPLE? (SEE FAQ)\"\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
