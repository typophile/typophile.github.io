    bright. Think either darker, or completely white. Like ultra dark charcoal with
    a fine crisp ice blue type. Or Completely white, like blind embossed text on a
    white business card. \r\n\r\nAnd lay off the cheap effects such as drop shadow
    and the like.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Honestly, this looks like it was thrown together without much thought, which
    does not say \"higher wage bracket\" to me.\r\n\r\nWhat is your reasoning for
    the different amount of space on each side (and the top) of the 'E'? Also, why
    is the 'i' the same height as the 'c' (no optical correction)?\r\n\r\nDo some
    sketches by hand first, come up with a concept, then hit the computer.\r\n\r\n

- body: "I agree wholeheartedly with Penn and Lex. Nothing about this is modern or
    high end. Seriously - time to start fresh! \r\n\r\nTry looking around in an affluent
    retail center at signs and product logos - observe what speaks to the \"higher
    wage bracket\" before you even touch pencil to paper. Look at jewelry and watches,
    browse through Prada, note all the lines and surfaces, the types of fonts, and
    imagine the logo for \"icE\" fitting into that environment. Then, sit and sketch
    out at least a dozen rough ideas - before you even turn your computer on! You'll
    be glad you did. "
