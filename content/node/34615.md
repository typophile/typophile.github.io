  here.:\r\n\r\nKerning in FOG\r\n\r\nThe fonts I'm generating are all generating
  with the kerning pairs I've created - but - they don't have any effect in the font.
  Running TTFDUMP or TXX, nothing jumps out at me as to why this is happening.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  I'm missing something?\r\n"

    memory architecture issue, which has been said was planned since FontLab took
    over FOG -- but only happened for Mac... ;)\r\n\r\nBut actually, the Kerning issue
    really doesn't make sense to me at the moment, unless there's something I'm doing
    wrong.\r\n\r\nThese are pixel-faces, by the way - so perhaps Hrant would have
    some clue?\r\n"

  body: "Well, what I've done for now -- is the age-hold and trusted method of sidebearing
    spacing in multiples of 125 left / 126 right to counter the problem. And instead,
    the problematic characters (basically just the lowercase 'j') set to 0 left.\r\n\r\nI
    wish I could have kerned this though with a couple of the caps. But it'll work
    for now. The small 'j' was really the only character that was breaking up the
    text in a major way. By subtracting it one pixel it reads a-okay.\r\n\r\nOne of
    the things that baffled me, was I initially attempted to just bring the left side-bearing
    into the small 'j'. But what this caused on Win XP was it butted the character
    up to the character to the right. This technique worked fine in Win 98, but not
    in XP. Interesting. Not sure if that's a TrueType renderer bug in XP, or what.\r\n"

  body: "Oh, and that at least allows a quick a dirty way to have both a tight and
    loose version, by only playing with the right side-bearing for the extra 1-pixel
    space.\r\n\r\nTight: Left SB 125 / Right SB 1\r\nLoose: Left SB 125 / Right SB
    126\r\n\r\n(And any characters needing a pseudo-kern (like a 'j'), set the LSB
    to 0.)\r\n"

  body: "Well, now I feel kind of silly. I think I located the conflict, though I
    have to run through the process again with the original metrics and kern pairs.\r\n\r\nThere
    was a flipped tag order in the header that I think may have caused the problem.
    This was my bad though, probably not FOG's issue. Font Validator was useful in
    confirming the order issue for me in this case.\r\n\r\n(The fonts were mapped
    out by hand in XML/TTX and originally compiled with TTX.exe. I may have just gotten
    the order wrong in my template for the two tags in question.)\r\n\r\nAlso: Noted,
    is I don't prefer the loose spacing of pixel-fonts, but the note in the above
    comment may be useful for anyone who really wants to make a loosely spaced pixel-font.
    Those are the values you should probably go by. I just don't see the need for
    it, when you can easily space (typeset) within Flash -- but depending on the design
    of the font, of course.\r\n"
