  body: It was probably custom lettering, but <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/craw-modern/">Craw

  body: "Oh, and the body text in Bodoni.\r\n\r\nThe script is custom lettering. You
    might find something similar <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&keywords=scriptscasual&template=Templates/Category.html&sortkey=order&sortorder=descending&sortby=recent\">here</a>.
    House Industries' <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/studiolettering\">Studio
    Swing</a> is also similar in some ways."
