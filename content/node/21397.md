body: "it is a a font used by trevor jackson on a promo-cd for german groove magazine.
  the whole look and feel also reminds me of paul snowden's work (www.paul-snowden.com).\r\n\r\nthe
  special thing is the capital T i think. maybe it's a hardcore common font, but i
  just couldn't get it. maybe sth like futura extra bold condensed...\r\n\r\nthanks
  a lot!"

    like that in Illustrator some years ago \u2014 slanting lines and tweaking some
    curves just a bit to make it look more \"custom\".\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the
    \"N\" looks like it's from another weight and shouldn't be there."

    that has been "squashed" a little bit.. although the "T" and the apostrophe are
    different. '

  body: "I guess we can conclude that it's squashed Univers Extra Black Oblique with
    customized \"T\", \"L\" and apostrophe. The result is the same.\r\n\r\nThe track
    listings are Agenda Black Italic (Font Bureau)."

    and the titles listings are the same...it had some agenda feel, but then the 'custom'
    T,L,E and F make it look different AND its fatter than agena black...\r\n"
