body: "Okay, I have a massive problem!\r\nI have my degree project due in just under
  a week, and I have made a fatal mistake of not chosing a good body copy font at
  the early stage of my project.\r\nSo as default, I have Times New Roman.\r\nBy now,
  I have completed about 80% of the whole thing but the problem is, my publication
  uses both digital and hand renderred techinques meaning that I have printed out
  my designs, drawn over them, scanned them again and used hand-rendered elements
  that have worked well meaning that If I were to change my body copy now, I will
  have to redesign many elements of my work which is something I cannot afford to
  do.\r\n\r\nSo I am looking for a font that will have the same or very similar geometry
  to \"times\"  so that when i change it, It won't make a significant change to my
  text boxes.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n"

    Ten</a>? Set it with all the ff-ligatures and text figures, and your project will
    look familiar yet more elegant. '

  body: "speter\r\n\r\nthanks for your suggestion, I've just realised that we have
    a limited amount of typefaces at our school and for some reason no typefaces by
    linotype foundary. :(\r\nand I don't have an access to credit card to purchase
    that typeface.\r\nI might have to not sleep and redo a bunch of work tonight.
    \r\nOh well, has to be done I guess...\r\nI've used meta for headings so i might
    use it for body copy as well.\r\nI don't have that much body copy, mostly illustrations
    and stuff so i guess I can get away with using a sans serif.\r\n\r\nthanks anyway
    though"

    Gyre</a> fonts, which at least have all the ff-ligatures, etc., even if the spacing
    isn''t as nice as Times Ten. '

    comes up as a nice Times alternative, and it's free, too.

  body: "WOW! I didn't think so many people would reply!\r\nthank you all for your
    suggestions, I have downloaded Lido typefamily and I actually really like it,
    and it though it made my text boxes a little smaller, there is no signifficant
    difference and I should be able to use it and get everything done and ready on
    time!\r\n\r\nThank you all for your responses!"
