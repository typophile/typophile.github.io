  body: To me it looks like a metal type version of Bembo. The &#39;r&#39; is characteristic
    and different from Garamond, which is what I first thought this might be. The
    very low stem above the crossbar of the &#39;t&#39; also seems like Bembo, but
    I can see from Monotype&#39;s digital version, these features are not identical.
    I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a digital font, even though it looks similar to Adobe
    Garamond.  I will stay with Bembo, although I recognize that Monotype&#39;s digital
    Bembo has a number of differences.

  body: This is a joke, right? These are taken from books published by Christopher
    Plantin in the 16th century. These typefaces don&#39;t exist anymore, except at
    the <a href="http://www.vandekerckhove-devos.be/plantin/index.html" target="_blank">Plantin
    Museum in Antwerp</a>. <BR> <BR>There are some modern interpretations of them.
    The best known is Matthew Carter&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-galliard/"
