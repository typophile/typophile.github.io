  when I replace lower case with small caps the brackets also reduce in size (shown
  in pink). There is a similar problem when replacing caps with small caps. As you
  can see with the illustration the feature code is pretty simple - just replacing
  one class with another. Could this be something that needs specifying as an exception
  to the context rule? The FontLab manual has no illustrations which demonstrate the
  meaning of the text, so consequently means nothing to me. That's the trouble with
  the manual; sometimes it has illustrations for obvious things, but none for not-so
  obvious things.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks."

    be applied throughout the whole text string?\r\nBut if you like it to work even
    in these cases, I guess you'll have to add some contextual stuff.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\nI haven't worked with c2sc and such before, but I think it would
    work if you take your punctuation out of the classes altogether for caps and small
    caps. That way your resized marks can replace the standard contextually as Christoph
    says.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: I think that you can define a different class for small brackets and everything
    is not a letter, in that way in smcp you can replace only the letters and in c2sc
    you replace letters and other glyphs

  body: "You seem to deal with smallcap punctuation in smcp. It'd be better to cover
    alternate smallcap punctuation only in c2sc (caps to small caps), but not in smcp
    (lowercase to small caps).\r\n\r\nThen, smallcap punctuation are applied only
    if a user selects \"All Small Caps\" in the application which activates both c2sc
    and smcp (so to test this behavior in FLS, you need to apply both too).\r\nIf
    a user selects \"Small Caps\", only smcp would be activated (without smallcap
    punctuation).\r\n\r\nIn so far I don't think that it makes sense to take smallcap
    punctuation out of smallcap features entirely. No contextuality needed either,
    that may mess things up even more.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "Right Karsten.\r\n\"smcp\" should be only for letters, so that it works as
    \"(Caps with) Small Caps\" in mixed case settings with upper and lower case, such
    as acronyms and names in text.\r\n\"c2sc\" should have all the bells and whistles,
    for when applications combine it with \"smcp\" to produce \"All Small Caps\"--for
    use in settings such as running heads, folios and title pages, where the idea
    is to produce an effect akin to optical scaling."
