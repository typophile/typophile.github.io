body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am in the process of brainstorming for a company that will design
  and print trading cards for children involved in sports. The concept of the company
  name \"9\" was my high school soccer number. The company will actively encourage
  children to participate in sports while reflecting on the positive impact that sports
  have on one's character, self-esteem, etc. Sports have done so much for me and I'd
  like to do something like this to encourage children to participate and follow their
  dreams.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm looking for something clean, hip and cutting edge. An identity
  that would appeal to youth (elementary, middle, high-school), on ball caps, t-shirts,
  hoodies, etc.. The attached logo is in its initial stages.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking
  for a sans serif font (for body text) that could work well with the text in this
  logo. Also, I'm looking for a nice font to go with the logo that reads \"established
  2007\" or something along those lines. Maybe something scripty, historic but modern
  and hip.\r\n\r\nThanks for much for any input that you can provide!\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: 'I''d go for the middle one at the bottom. The "serif" on the n gives it a
    nice touch (especially with its repeat as the dot on the i). I''m not to sure
    about the 9 though. Maybe you could play around with it some more, it looks a
    little out of place now. I think a 9 with a straight diagonal descender would
    be better for the type. You definitely need a different font for the "established
    2007" bit. Something scripty might be good & give it a extra vintage sporty look. '

    finalizing it. More than ever, kids need to be active and self-motivated to build
    confidence and pride. \r\n\r\nI don't want to knock your work, because I think
    the first crop of ideas is well done. I would like to maybe suggest a title change
    to reflect your goals. I don't feel any connection to the word/number \"nine\".
    How about something that creates a connection between group sports and the individual
    like maybe... Team One. Just something to consider.\r\n\r\nSecondly I agree with
    Tom on the type choice for the number 9. I'd suggest a vertical descender as well,
    maybe an italicized sans.\r\n\r\nAnd you're looking for a script for the established
    2007 text that's modern. Check out the script faces at www.sudtipos.com/home like
    Amorinda or Malback (Veer also carries some nice modern scripts) or maybe even
    September from t26 (http://www.t26.com/fonts/September)\r\n\r\nA sans serif body

    room for improvement with the concept (Team One, etc.). I've been feeling that
    disconnect too so it's great to hear it from someone. The sudtipos scripts are
    brilliant choices that I'll look into. I'll explore this very soon and repost.

    body: "Thanks again for all of your input. I'm currently brainstorming on name
      possibilities for this company. In addition to the style presented above, I'm
      also drawn to the athletic-looking vintage baseball scripts. I think this might
      work well for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn thinking more about the name of the company,
      I became nostalgic and thought about my youth, playing sports with my father
      in the backyard. He certainly was a huge influence in the development of my
      passion for sports. His sports nickname was \"Jimmy\" and I'd love to use it
      as a name/logo but, I'm concerned about the alternate meanings associated with
      this expression. :)  Am I off track here? Vintage but somewhat modern, sporty.
      Jimmy. The best fonts of this style that I found are Fenway Park and Ballpark
      Script.\r\n\r\nI really like the style of the attached Peralta logo too.\r\n\r\nResearch

      body: "Here's an update. I have been working on other name possibilities for
        this company and did some testing with the latin word \"mirus\" which means
        \"extraordinary\". I thought this was a strong word with a hidden/subtle meaning
        that can communicate how extraordinary kids are while touching upon one of
        the business objectives of the business - designing and producing high-end,
        unique, compelling and extraordinary trading cards for youth athletes. Sports
        can be a means of building a child's self-esteem, confidence, etc. and these
        trading cards will help facilitate this.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to add some kind
        of dimensionality or effect to the star or some type of rectangular shapes
        (see logo 5) with dimension to make this logo more appealing. I like the symbolism
        of the star (achievement, special, etc.) but also wonder if there is a visual
        way to show an abstract image of trading, cards, etc. I'll pursue this further
        soon.\r\n\r\nIn case you can't read the text. it reads: MIRUS.. trading cards..
        Extraordinary Kids. Extraordinary cards.\r\n\r\nThanks for any input that

  body: I wouldn't use 3D-like shapes in this logo. I like the way the third one looks
    which is -I assume- the same as the first without the supporting text "Extraordinary
    kids. Extraordinary cards". It's either because of its smaller size or because
    the fact that it's set in white against a black background (my guess is the first),
    but it works better this way. In the second logo the star in front kind of takes
    away the effect of the "serif" from the "m" which is the logo's primary appeal.
    The fourth is a definite no-go.

    #1 is quite suitable, IMHO. The 'S' is a bit serpentine-esque, and I just don't

    agree with the serpentine comment about the S. I may alter this a little bit for

    most logos today that try to be \"hip\" by adding 3D effects. It also harkens
    back to the old-school Starter jackets and team logos. Although, I do have to
    say that the 3D logos that you attached above are very nice.\r\n\r\n-Scott\r\n\r\nP.S.:
    Just to clarify what I meant by \"cognate:\" I should have said \"false cognate
    for 'mirror'\" because a cognate is a word in another language that looks like
    its translation in English. i.e. \"Automobile\" looks like the English translation
    \"Automobile.\" So although mirus doesn't mean 'mirror,' it could easily be viewed
    that way if you don't know Latin. Just a point of information. :)"

    body: "Thanks for your feedback, Scott and my apologies for the delayed response.
      I'm still feeling that the logo needs a little \"something\" to make it feel
      complete. I'm still exploring if this is a 3d look or simple effect applied
      to the letters/logo to make it more visually interesting.\r\n\r\nFor now, I
      put together a quick card to show the mirus logo in use with a secondary logo
      that could potentially be used for the first base set of cards for this series.
      The base set would be entitled \"Authentic\" or \"JD Authentic\". The example
      I am presenting here is a very quick, rough concept with little to no real type
      treatment for the player name, position, team and number. I'm working on fine
      tuning these logos (primary and secondary) to make them work well together.
      Again, some king of coloring, or simple effect (weathered, for example, for
      the authentic logo). As you all know, the \"Authentic\" font is Fenway Park
      from Veer. I'm impressed with it but am working on creating a \"JD Authentic\"
      logo.\r\n\r\nSo, that's it for now. Any feedback is certainly welcome. Thanks
      so much again for all of you assistance.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card1_3994.jpg]"
