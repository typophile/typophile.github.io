  of the text  \"From Director J.J. Abrams\" and \"The Future Begins\"\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be most appreciated. :)"

    which seems inspired a bit by <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/digital_sans/">Digital
    Sans</a>.

  body: Hmm, it looks like Zekton is actually an improved version of the <a href="http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/8340">Zekton
    Deluxe Bold</a> which was used for the trailer. It's too bad that a studio with
    a multi-million dollar budget is using sloppy free fonts for a trailer. I can
    see the title designer now, trawling through free font archives, completely unaware
    of the universe of quality type that lies beyond dafont.com.

  body: I can't find an exact match, but it's similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/zeroes/three/">Zeroes
    Three</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/konstantynov/tecco/bold/">Tecco
    Bold</a>.

  body: Stephen, looks like we cross-posted. It isn't one of the Zekton fonts either;
    some of the characters are clearly different, such as the <cite>R</cite>. (The
    differences are a lot more obvious if you look at the 1080p high-definition version
    of the trailer.)

  body: "You're right. I was looking at the small type at the end of the trailer \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/star1_4915.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/star2_6535.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich
    is different from the large type used for \u201CFrom Director J.J. Abrams\u201D
    and \u201CThe Future Begins\u201D. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/star4_4212.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/star5_5878.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    later still looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/zekton/heavy/?refby=typographica\">Zekton
    Heavy</a> with the stencilesque breaks removed. All other outlines match."

  body: You could be right on "Future Begins"! But the counters in "J.J. Abrams" are
    the same size as those in Zekton.
