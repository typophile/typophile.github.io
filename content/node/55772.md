  body: Thanks Michael. Been wondering myself if something similar is out there. hope
    not. Did some small revisions to the pen tip of the leaf, i think it helps out
    a little bit. And also thinking of some fall colors of the leaf, but hadn't settled
    on anything yet.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_revised_4497.png]

    creative idea as seen in Food Writers' logo by 300million. It's really a coincidence:)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/food-writers_m_5131.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for the comments fellas. Truth is, I've got my fountain pen write next
    to me on my desk for illustration and type, so it was a simple solution that was
    right in front of me. But I really do like the food writers' logo, makes mine
    look like shite.

    fill in. '

  body: I like it. Might try one with the leaf being a tad simplified. Make it a bit
    more 'nubby' rather than 'leafy'

  body: '@aluminum - thanks for the comments. came to that conclusion today also,
    trying to simplify. It''s become too busy looking the more I look at it. I''ll
    revise and post to see if the revisions are an improvement. @michael - appreciate
    the kind words. not second guessing - just admiring good work.'

    of the leaf.

    name: apankrat
  body: That ^ is an excellent idea. And the stem itself would form a line that was
    just written.

  body: I was thinking just at the end of the stem. An additional signifier would
    unnecessarily clutter the mark.

    a shot and see how it looks. Thanks for the suggestion.'

    afraid it will be taken more as a guitar with the stem attached, but maybe that
    can be fixed by thinning the hole and split. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawing01_4235.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawing02_4912.jpg].\r\n\r\n@everyone

    to make the best decision.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawing03_3624.jpg]

  body: "I think the reworked version - the top left one out of the set - is worth
    exploring further. Versions with differently sized stem side look more like butterflies
    to me, <em>especially</em> when they are oriented vertically.\r\n\r\nHave you
    considered using two leafs so that the stem of one forms an ink feed of another.
    I.e. start with one leaf, duplicate, rotate 180 deg, and shift it along its stem
    until stem's end is in the middle of the first leaf..."

  body: Thanks for the comments. here's some updates. tweaked the tip of the split
    and widened the split channel for smaller sizes. Also, on some have ditched the
    stem completely. and offered some other colors. improvements?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leaves_4992.jpg]
