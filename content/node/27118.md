  body: Actually, the V doesn&#39;t quite match up, and neither do the R&#39;s, now
    that I look at it.  You can check around DaFont&#39;s <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/bitmap.php?texte=JE+ME+SENS+TROP+EN+FORME">Bitmap</a>
    and <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=301&amp;texte=JE+ME+SENS+TROP+EN+FORME">Square</a>
    galleries if you&#39;re still hungry, but I think that 04b_19 face is close enough
    to get you by.
