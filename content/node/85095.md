  The client has requested to see a variation of the logo with upper and lowercase
  letters, and now I find myself in the unexpected position of having to explain that
  some fonts don't have lowercase letters without making it sound like I've chosen
  and incomplete or inadequate typeface.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAny suggestions? I admit
  I don't fully know the history of the style, and suspect there is likely a historic
  reason for it, but I don't want to have to give my client a history lesson. Any
  tips on a clear, concise way to explain (and justify) the use of caps-only typefaces
  besides \"it looks cleaner/bolder/better\"?"
