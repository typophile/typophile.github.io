body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nLooking for a serif to pair with a surprisingly warm, humanistic
  geometric I came across. Client is trying to project complete competence and professionalism,
  but friendly approachability. Client has a brand history with a fairly cold Modern.\r\n\r\nSo
  I thought to find a typeface with vertical or near-vertical stress. I'd like fairly
  low contrast between thicks and thins (thicker thins, not thinner thicks), because
  I'm concerned about the letters falling apart in low-resolution situations (like
  web). I am leaning away from letterforms with serifs that are too substantial or
  chunky; a certain balance in the serifs between delicate elegance and being able
  to stand up in low rez situations.\r\n\r\n**edit, insert** I'll just need normal,
  italic, bold, and bold italic. **end edit**\r\n\r\nAnd, naturally, I thought that
  you would know better than I what a few viable options might be.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nAmado"

    And also provide more information on how the serif font would be used (titling,
    text block, etc.)? I feel nonobjective on suggesting anything, right now.'

  body: "F\xE1bio,\r\n\r\nhttp://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/edelsans/\r\n\r\nMy (admittedly
    unimaginative) typical formula is:\r\n\r\n * in print, use the sans of a pairing
    for titles and subheads, and use the serif for body text.\r\n * for electronic
    media, use the serif of a pairing for titles and subheads, and use the sans for
    body text.\r\n\r\nThis particular customer won't be writing a book, so print use
    will be limited to posters, postcards, brochures, mailers, and other small-scale
    publications (forms, invoices, etc). And there will be a website, so I usually
    like to find a sans I think might work for website body-text, and a serif that
    (usually in its Bold weight, but not always) stands up to being embedded with
    @font-face.\r\n\r\n'zat 'nuf?\r\n\r\n-Amado\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n(*
