  on the back cover of the Joy Division album \"Unknown Pleasure\". Let me find an
  image of it and i will post it here.\r\n\r\nhere is a link...\r\n\r\nhttp://i3.ebayimg.com/05/i/000/d4/d4/8856_10.JPG\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\njosh"

  body: It's good old Helvetica. I once heard Peter Saville talking about this in
    an interview, he expressed his reluctance to include type anywhere on the outer
    sleeve... he got his wish for the front, but had to settle for 9pt Helvetica on
    the back.

  body: '"Unknown Pleasure" looks like Helvetica, but "Joy Division" looks like Univers.
    Look at the S.'

  body: I'm really not sure about the Helvetica claim. It "feels" like Univers, but
    maybe that's due to the limited resolution. We should see this at a better resolution
    to be conclusive.

  body: "hmm, yeah, i don't have a bigger scan, i wish I did because it is really
    hard to tell whether it is Helvetica or Univers.\r\n\r\nHey Charles, on that interview,
    do you remember Peter Saville specifically saying it was 9pt Helvetica?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\njosh"

    US release.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joydivision_4698.jpg]\r\n\r\nGo
    to the YouTube I posted and see version 4 to hear about the cover design. Stockport
    is south Manchester and where I have spent lots of time.\r\n\r\nNote the 'FACTUS
    1' on it which means FACT US no. 1 as in the USA version 1.00 release the first
    US release by Factory Records."

  body: "It is not Helvetica because the lowercase 'a' right side goes straight down
    and does not have an extenstion like Helv. Also the figure 'one' in Helvetica
    doesn't have a straight top extenstion but a curved one. The parens are spot on
    Univers as is the lowercase 'g', comma, and numerals. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSvuP8dnz84&feature=related"

  body: "Hmmm... It was a while ago I watched the documentary, which was called, 'Factory-
    From Joy Division to Happy Mondays' on BBC. I definitely remember him saying about
    the reluctance to include type on the outer sleeve, but I can't be sure about
    the 9pt Helvetica comment, I may have just imagined this, or its a mis-informed
    comment I've heard somewhere?\r\n\r\nUntil now, I've always just presumed it was
    Helvetica, but never really studied it up close... so I was wrong to say it definitely
    IS without checking - sorry.\r\n\r\nAfter more investigation, I now agree with
    Lex & Miss Tiffany - It's got to be Univers.\r\n\r\nAs I was checking my recently
    purchased 12\" Remastered Vinyl (2007) it has thrown up an interesting point.
    The UNKNOWN PLEASURES title appears to be set in DIN or Akzidenz? \r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UP_4290.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
    you check out the next image, a sticker from the back, it claims to have 'original
    artwork' - I don't think so!\r\n\r\nThe sticker also reveals that the artwork
    was 're-editioned' by 'Something Else'... I think they have some explaining to
    do... I'm feeling a little cheated here![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sticker_3482.jpg]"

  body: "So the USA one is Univers then so the UK FACT 10 is Helvetica, the US is
    FACTUS1 in Univers. Sorted then.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joydivision_5566.jpg]\r\n\r\ncompare
    the lowercase 'y' and figure '2' Univers has a straight y and 2 not curved or
    with a hook ending. \r\n\r\nenclosed is the sharper shot of the innersleeve of
    the 1980 original USA FACTUS1 LP."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/backcover_5317.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis is the
    1980 FACTUS1 original back cover. \r\n\r\non your recent one it probably only
    refers to the image as being a reproduction since most people don't call type
    'artwork' so they probably 'remastered' the typography.\r\n\r\nAgain the figure
    1, lc 'a' and 'y' and 'parens' are all Univers.\r\n\r\nOn your newly purchased
    'remastered' one I like th (P) registered product symbol, you don't see that in
    fonts very much.\r\n\r\nAlso I doubt the US version was the same as the UK version
    since very few LPs or CD are the same since they are usually produced locally.
    I have many US and UK CDs that are the same and My wife who's a Manc has UK version
    of the ones I have as US. Her UK Suede Cds aren't the same as my US 'London' Suede
    (??? they are Mancs!) and the songs are different.\r\n\r\nAnd to be honest I'm
    surprised I have the US version of Unknown Pleasures since most of the LPs I have
    from back then were 'Imported' since the first versions were never producted in
    the US until much later. "
