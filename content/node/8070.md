  on the Adobe Forums. I already know that I&#39;m using the wrong app to set extended
  text &#40;5 or 6 paragraphs&#41;  in a text box. I&#39;m using single-line composer
  for editing. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really wondering if anyone else has &#40;had&#41;
  this problem and has found a solution.  <BR> <BR>Boohoo.'

  body: To clarify, it isn&#39;t consistantly slow. Only occasionally do I start looking
    around for my FreeHand 3.0 disks. ;^&#41; I guess that drives me the most crazy..

    digitizing music in ITunes this slows it down too.

  body: Sometime OpenType faces make my computers go sssssssssssllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwww.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know why. They shouldn&#39;t do that, should they? Anyway,
    I&#39;ve had maybe a similar problem to yours in InDy and Illustrator. Usually,
    I get mad an quit everything. Then, when I reload the program, thing go a little
    faster for a while. Sometimes I convert things to outlines that I know won&#39;t
    change to speed up the process.

  body: It&#39;s really the &#34;spinning ball of death&#34; part which sounds loony,
    not the rest of it.  Is that death ball thingy anything like the Rover from The
    Prisoner?  Or perhaps it&#39;s the Death Star Logo spinning out of control, brought
    to you by AT&amp;T. <BR> <BR>Have you tried winding up the crank on the side?  That&#39;s
    fixed similar problems for me in the past... umm, now that I think about it, that
    was an Edison cylinder player.  Never mind. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m starting to wonder
    how long it&#39;ll be before we see the first OpenType virus. &#34;Why does every
    document I print out with this font say &#39;0wN3D bY l33t haXX0r!!1111&#39; at
    the top?&#34;
