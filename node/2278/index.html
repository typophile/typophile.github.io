  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK guys, as I mentioned in the Magazine Design discussion (see General), I started working on a project for a new magazine that I hope to get published, with the help of a few friends and a huge dose of luck, here in Italy (I'm from Milan). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It will be a gay lifestyle magazine. It will focus primarily on Italy, but with an international feel (btw, did you get the Flaunt Italian issue? Nice. Hrant ,you'll probably like the lavish Monica Bellucci centre article!). The text will be in Italian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After doing a lot of research, two certainties: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) ALL gay magazines look like CRAP (So much for the myth that most gay men have good taste!) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seriously, I coudn't find a single one decently designed. Attitude (UK), Out (US), Zero (Spain), Tetu (France) are the best ones, but they are all very average stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Italian gay magazines are even MORE CRAP. The biggest one, Babilonia, is a horrid mess (both in terms of design and content). Honestly, guys, even if I assume most of you wouldn't be interested, I'll spare you the JPGs, because of its utter ugliness (I know the guy who does it, he's a nice guy, but he's NOT a designer and it shows). All other Italian gay magazines are free, and, essentially, fanzines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, here's where I'd like some opinions from you, if you can bother: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) I'd like it to be a mainstream title, but with some class (this magazine won't be free). I'm looking at the currently best designed men magazines around for ideas. I like Details and the US Esquire (I agree with you Tiffany on this one, if you're reading). Most of all, I like the colors of these two, which are pretty similar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) The magazine will be 230 x 287 mm (same as Colors Magazine), printed on uncoated paper. I'd like it to be not too busy, with more generous white space than the two titles I mentioned before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) Here's the deal for typefaces: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one serif body text for main articles; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one sans for departments (and possibly headlines); <!-- raw HTML omitted -->maybe an additional headline face. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You think two faces, with a versatile sans, should be enough? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SANS: I really, REALLY like the new DTL, Prokyon.  Not availabe yet, unfortunately, and I fear outrageously expensive, like all DTFs. Have a look at its PDF (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Nieuws.html">http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Nieuws.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SERIF: guys, you input here is mostly needed! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My favorite serif EVER is still FB Proforma, but I'm only slightly concerned that the Book weight is a little too light and its Medium a little too dark (although it is beautifully used in Eye magazine) at 9,5/12, which is what I used to build the grid. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also happen to like a lot  the Baskervilles and their revivals. I was never too fond of Licko's Mrs. Eaves; the new FF Atma (by Alan Green) is prettier, but I'm still not convinced. [Mid Caps? Quarter Caps? Hmmmmpf.]) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I recently saw the face used as main text in the Typography 22 Type Directors Club Annual and immediately fell in love with it: Letraset/Fontek Eplica, by Yvonne Diedrich. It looks beautiful at small sizes and it has a very distinctive structure. I don't really care about the fancy ligatures (similar to Mrs. Eaves), but I think its &quot;bilateral serif construction&quot; is truly interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do you guys think of it (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.letraset.com/LetrasetUK/Templates/Letraset/mainscreen.asp">http://www.letraset.com/LetrasetUK/Templates/Letraset/mainscreen.asp</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->)? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HEADLINES: If I decide to add a headline only face, I like the new HTF Gotham by Frere-Jones (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->), although I still love good old HTF Knockout. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what do you think of this possible combination? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Serif Text: Eplica or Proforma; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sans text (and possibly some headlines for departments): Prokyon (although I'm still testing it, there's only a PDF!); <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) Headlines only: Gotham (maybe Knockout instead?). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you think it may work? Other suggestions? Opinions? Your help will be really much appreciated. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, and please excuse me for this very long posting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ciao a tutti. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paolo</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paolo &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding FB Proforma, I'd be willing to bet that Blokland did the design using MMs and that you might be able to get a custom weight in between the Book and the Medium without too much hassle. If you want to pursue it, you should talk to Harry at FB. He could tell you what might be possible and for how much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've liked Eplica since the TDC last year, but I haven't seen extended text settings. I'm skeptical about how it might hold up over the long run as a primary text face in a magazine. I think it could be useful for decks and pulls, depending upon the text face. But I wouldn't use Mrs. Eaves (unless possibly the updated version has been refitted). Perhaps you would like to consider my <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Whitman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Sorry for the shameless plug, everybody.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It's not as idiosyncratic or as hip as Eplica, but it is somewhat Baskervilleian (even though that wasn't my intent). I hope to be able to announce Whitman's official release very soon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Much as I like them both, I suspect that the combination of Gotham and Prokyon would clash a little. I can't be sure without testing them in proximity. I think Knockout would provide a better contrast to Prokyon. And, of course, Knockout would provide a lot more opportunities for variety in your heads with all its weights and widths. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eplica is a good choice. I think it has lots of wonderful ligatures which are always a nice bonus. For sans Prokyon does not do it for me.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would suggest contacting Peter Bilak to see what release date is scheduled for Fedra Serif, it would be great with the rest of the Fedra Family and a good solution for the whole magazine. thers is even a bit map (for website0, and a mono spaced version (all unique designs)  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perhaps it does not have the best headline version but this could be designed as a custom version.

		<div class="commentbody">Paolo, et al &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Separately, your fonts choices are all very nice. I agree that Mrs. Eaves is too OTT and has also been over-used making it more than a face to simply be read. Prokyon &ndash; wow! &ndash; Hrant, check out the lowercase g, two amazing choices for you! Gotham is great, I purchased it and have been using it for this and that and I love it. You might send a  wish list to the friendly people at HTF and mention a desire for more weights, you might not be denied. (?) Knockout <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a knockout.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IMHO and especially in magazine design (if not all design) less is always more. This, I think, applies to your typefaces. I personally would pick families with a lot of variety. Titling, text and smaller text for the serif and ultra thin to mega fat for the sans. Cover all of your bases.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SERIF: Have you looked at <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hoefler's Requiem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beautiful, Elegant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or their Hoefler Text?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hoefler's Text<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which also has <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hoefler's Titling<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Have you looked at <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Font Bureau's Eldorado<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? I really haven't noticed recently, but it really used to be used quite elegantly by Entertainment weekly. If you do want something a little more idiosyncratic, but in a good way IMHO, try <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Emigre's Vendetta<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I do think this face is very beautiful and I haven't seen it used very much. But it doesn't offer titling and text weights, which is a problem for publication design. One other that I find very elegant and it does have companions of variance, is <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Typofonderie's Le Monde Livre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SANS:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Font Bureau's Noble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, perhaps <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Le Monde Sans<!-- raw HTML omitted --> should you choose Le Monde Livre? And you could use <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Anisette<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Anisette Petite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for display and flavor? or you could try <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Berthold's Gerstner Original<!-- raw HTML omitted --> paired with <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Corporate S<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a more cool feel. There is <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Agenda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with tons of variety also. And there is also <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Rhode<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As boring as this perhaps will make me, I think that you really will be happier with streamlining your font choices. Even if you choose two serif families and two sans faces they should still harken to something similar. What I mean by this is not mixing the humanist sans with the grots or the oldstyle serif with the transitional.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the idea of uncoated paper, but considering your desires, I might consider a dull or matte coated instead. I do like the paper <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Colors<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is exciting. Thanks for including us Paola, mille grazie!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; more generous white space than the two titles I mentioned before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know about gay Italians, but personally I like white space when it's not white. And I don't mean a solid color either, I mean a texture. Check out the &quot;L'Occitane&quot; brochure for a breathtaking example. A weak view here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.loccitane.com/usa/index.html">http://www.loccitane.com/usa/index.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fonts: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's always tempting to read too much into the demographic and make crazy associations in your design choices. I think it's useful and necessary to make associations, but it has to be toned down to work in real life. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Prokyon would be a superb choice. Also look at Tankard's brand-new Aspect: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm">http://www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm</a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it doesn't have a nice dark weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Proforma is one of my all-time favorite designs, but I'm not sure it works here. Do you have a view of Eplica that doesn't require a site registration? Atma, I don't see working at all, even though I love the multiple cap sizes. Gotham I don't think works here, but maybe Knockout. Mrs Eaves is pretty, but the horrid spacing makes it unsuitable for text (as Kent implied, but so tactfully). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; So what do you think of this possible combination? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; &hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, unless Eplica is a really plain design (or if it's close to Prokyon - unlikely) I think it's too busy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait a second, OK, I see Eplica at the TDC:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah, it's too strong to coexist with your other stuff. Plus it couldn't carry too much text anyway. If you want people to read your magazine (not just look at the pictures), then you need to be more subtle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kent: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you should talk to Harry at FB <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmmm. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kent, am I smelling Whitman coming out at FB? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paolo, Whitman might in fact be a great choice (maybe a breath of fresh air in your seemingly overdesigned environment), and it will be released soon I think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Fedra series might actually be a good choice, but it depends on the upcoming serif version, noting that Bilak's previous text face (Eureka) is too loose for readability. Sure, you can tighten it, but only if you're willing to manually add some positive kerning pairs for the resultant clashes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was going to suggest the wonderful Kepler/Meridien/Vendome triumvirate, but maybe it's too stodgy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also consider Bloemsma's unique Avance, possibly with Cocon for heads. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiffany: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Hrant, check out the lowercase g, two amazing choices for you! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I think Kent is right that the bicam one got dumped. :-(  Well, maybe it makes sense since it's no text face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Vendetta might be an interesting choice, but its lack of texture-versus-size compensation really cripples it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JFP's library is also a good place to look (he has some funky display stuff too - like Costa). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guys, I love you, you are all great!! Thank you so much for sharing your ideas with me. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I certainly  am NOT a typography expert as all of you obviously are (no formal training on typography here, sadly, only a graphic design degree, a healthy curiosity, and - this worries me the most - a very limited experience in print, as I've been working on websites mostly for the past 7 years). For this, I really treasure your opinions, since you have so much more experience. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please, keep going with your ideas on my project, critiques, suggestions, EVERYTHING! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you Kent and Ole for your suggestions, both Whitman and Fedra look very interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the serif text face: for now I'll TRY using Eplica, see if it works, but of course I'm willing to reconsider. I'm still at a very early stage of the design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the sans: I definitely want to try to use Prokyon, IF it will be available anytime soon (I already wrote asking for info to the DTL guys). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By doing a lot of cut &amp; paste from the PDF, I'm trying to see if it may work for the headlines also (and even for the masthead), even though it doesn't have the versatility of Knockout, having only four weights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the idea of using two faces only for this project, and try to explore all their possible uses. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Prokyon is not available anytime soon, I would like to use another humanist sans (been giving a try to Wenzel's FF Profile and Abbink's FF Kievit, I like them both as a sans for text, but I'm not sure if they can cut it for headlines). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiffany, thank you for your enthusiasm, you obviously love magazines at least as much as I do! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are absolutely right about narrowing my choice. I'll try to stick to Eplica and Prokyon only, at first (even though I wanted to try Gotham so much, it's so nice!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you are right about not mixing a humanist sans with a Grotesk like Knockout, and Kent's thoughts about Prokyon and Gotham possibly clashing almost convinced me about not using them together. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, I can't wait to hear also Hrant's opinions, even though I know already he likes Prokyon, from his postings on Typographi.ca. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiffany, could you please elaborate some more about your thoughts on the paper I should use? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This forum is so great.

I'm not thinking of using it with all those ligatures for the main copy, of course I would stick to f-ligatures only. Still not convinced it may work with Prokyon?

You have all been extremely helpful and friendly, and my magazine can only improve because of your suggestions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To have someone like Kent, who is willing to give me printed samples of his still unreleased new typeface for possibly using it on my project is simply AMAZING (thank you so much, Kent, I will send you my specs and italian copy by email tonight or tomorrow). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most of all, being here talking with all of you is FUN (almost too much, in fact, I have a magazine to do here, even though it's just a dummy issue - back to work, Paolo!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today I took half a day off. Hot and sunny here in Milan, everybody is away from the city (in Italy nobody works in August, there's a long holiday break; Tibor Kalman was complaining about it, when he was in Rome art-directing Colors Magazine: those lazy Italians&hellip;). Only me and the cat left in the city, apparently. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Been doing A LOT of thinking, about this project, my daily job, my future&hellip; but I digress. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I woke up in a good mood: now that I have Stephen and Hrant's approval, I will try using Prokyon and Documenta for the magazine, with Kent's Whitman as a possible alternative for text. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's it.

		<div class="commentbody">Mmmmmmm&hellip; doubts. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Okay, I'm still working on the main grid, the colors and I plan to start working on spreads, departments and the inner stuff of the magazine first leaving the cover for last, but I could't resist doodling a bit with a possible masthead. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A bit of background around the proposed name for the magazine: Tom. It comes after endless brainstorming sessions with friends (mostly with Antonio, who will be this magazine's Editor, if it will ever see the light of day). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's short. Friendly. It works in Italian (as short for Tommaso), as a pretty common guy's name. And it works in English too (Hrant, you were talking about Flaunt's Euro-cool factor, I think it's pretty much what we'd like here). Besides, in Italy we already have Max, a men's magazine sort of like GQ. And of course, Tom has many free associations for gays: Tom Cruise (show me a gay man who doesn't fancy this guy, if you can); Tom Ford (Italian men are obsessed with fashion, gay OR straight); and Tom of Finland (the king of tasteful gay erotica; [www.http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/2000/04/08/tom_finland/], if you feel inclined). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's where I need you opinions. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please note: these are absolutely preliminary sketches, nothing is final here. (Tiffany, if you're reading this, please don't get too distracted by the harshly-lit stock library hunk, this image is just a generic placeholder, a possible background for the masthead). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tried to see if Prokyon could work for the masthead; here are the two heaviest weights that I ASSUME will be the final ones. (Note that I cut and pasted from the Prokyon PDF as bitmaps, so the kerning is obviously wrong.) I don't speak German, but I think they will be Medium and Bold; or maybe Bold and Extra Bold? Wait a minute, maybe there is an intermediate weight between these two! Hard to tell. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->003: I like the chunkyness of this (and I know that italians in general like chunky type). But I think this is possibly too chunky. Besides, if it wasn't for the lovely M, it reminds me too much of the previous masthead for the US Out magazine (before it got redesigned again; I have some old issues, I could post it for reference if you want). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->004: More elegant. But maybe too spindly for a masthead? Again, if it wasn't for the M, isn't it a little too generic-looking? Maybe an intermediate weight about these two would be right. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->005: an alternative to Prokyon for the masthead, with Thirstype's Infinity. I think it works, but I'm afraid it's a little too trendy looking. Gay Italians would probably love it, and grow tired of it after six months. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But somehow, it has a lot of character, maybe more than Prokyon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do you think? Be ruthless, guys. Tell me which one you hate most. Or love. Or both. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should I reconsider and start from scratch? Or try more elaborate type treatments? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know about you, but I don't like overdesigned mastheads, in general. I like them to be effective, distinctive but still simple, somehow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's late, I'm tired, it's hard to judge.

Heavier is better than lighter. But for just the three letters, it probably wouldn't be too much work to tweak an in-between weight.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the overall character, the challenge you face with a name like TOM is that these are three bilaterally symmetrical letters and, of the three, the M is usually the only one with any creative aesthetic possibilities, especially in a general-purpose type design. You might want to consider customizing a little bit for a more unique nameplate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One quick idea for the Prokyon is to add a little rounding to the right arm of the T to reflect that wonderful M. This adds just a little touch of character to the letter and allows it to snuggle up to the O a little better. I doctored a quick example of what I'm describing: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just an idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Another thought: because of the bilateral symmetry, you might be able to get away with stacking TOM vertically in the upper left corner, for a slightly different effect. The downside is that you might lose the full nameplate in the back of a magazine rack. But . . . if your T is distinctive, then it might act as a teaser and get browsers to pick it up to see what the rest says. Or maybe people will just think the name is T, like O or W magazines.</div>

A backlash against the backlash against blackletter?  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Masthead: I like the heavy weight, but possibly only in the context of your image - which gives me the idea that maybe the weight (or even the case?!) should vary depending on the image - like if it's a strong, dark image, you might use a lighter weight*. This sort of thing is becoming more common, even though there's a risk to building a strong identity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* You could even throw in Kent's vertical idea, as needed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; if it wasn't for the M, isn't it a little too generic-looking? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In fact, not only that, but there's no harmony between the &quot;T&quot; and the &quot;M&quot;. Lettering (like in a masthead) is very different than a font. Probably not in the context of the actual font, but in this context the &quot;T&quot; needs to be modified. Consider rounding off the top corners of the horizontal bar of the &quot;T&quot;. And/or you could introduce some flaring in the bar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another thing: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;M&quot; has some relatively strong trapping (those cuts in its armpits and in the V element). If you like them, great: you should put traps in the &quot;T&quot; also; and maybe even the &quot;O&quot; (probably at top and bottom)! There's the risk that people will make crazy associations with homosexuality, and it might reflect as amateurism on your part. Personally, I would remove the trapping from the &quot;M&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, you should tighten the &quot;TO&quot; a bit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lastly: I think you should avoid Infinity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; &quot;the typeface for the masthead &hellip; bears no relationship to any other type style in the magazine&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this is too purist. To me, the cover has a very distinct function (as compared to the inside, or even the back cover), especially for a money-making operation: it needs to get the person to pick it up, and then open up the magazine. If your insides make the sale, chances are the person will not refuse to buy the next issue based solely on a mismatch between the masthead and the inside type. Meaning: if you use Prokyon for the masthead, you don't *have* to use it inside. (Except the price of this particular font would make such a decision somewhat wasteful.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unless the magazine is for gay Italian *typographers*&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before you set aside the design of the flag (or masthead) you should consider the fact that the cover sets the stage for the rest of the piece. Type, paper, grid, colors&hellip; all important things. But, the flag should come next. I'm not sure what Mr. Heller's is getting at, I can only guess that I would agree with him based on past writings. I need a little more context. But if what he is saying is that cover is separate from the interior of the magazine then he is entirely wrong. I believe that the cover should reflect the interiors.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's a silly analogy. As you walk toward the kitchen, you smell garlic and reggiano. What foods do you envision? I'm thinking pasta, capellini perhaps. Then you step through the kitchen doors and you are treated with microwave chinese. Your stomach will lurch and then you will be sad because your taste buds had worked themselves into a frenzy for something else. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This has happened in other magazines. The cover is all tease and promise and the interiors fall short of that promise. Or viceversa.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should not the cover, as Hrant mentioned, be the reason to pick it up? Yes. Should not also the cover hint and what is inside? Yes. Obviously, certain things, rules, can be broken. Such as the grid. But then you've already set that up and for the features your grid is this and for your departments the grid is that. I think you get the idea.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really think you should not save the cover until last. You could miss out on opportunties and discoveries.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my experience as a teacher, (perhaps to some of you this doesn't count), the students that solved the grid, flag, general style (photography &amp; illustration) type choices, and themes (color) first, they were the ones that were more successful in seeing this throughout the magazine. The cover should not be the afterthought. Not, Paolo, that this is what you are doing. I'm only trying to make a point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I guess I disagree with Hrant. Not that every face used within has to be used without (on the cover). Or vice versa. As long as the face used is not so completely different or against what the rest of the magazine does. ??? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are right <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rolling Stone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does get to break a lot of the rules. But, if you notice (and I wish I had an issue here to make sure this is still the case) does not the flag/masthead still resemble the contents page faces, the departments? The features are a little different in that they, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rolling Stone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also try to conceptually open each feature. Or at least they used to. So I could be entirely wrong.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about using Whitman (an early display version Kent?) as the flag? Isn't everyone trying to use Sans now? I also like Kent's idea of altering Prokyon. This is, after all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> place at which people should be able to begin to make assumptions about the magazine? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One more boring, and perhaps redundant point. Really explore the placement of your flag. How you treat this could also set the stage for other things like placement of other big type in your department, for instance.</div>
