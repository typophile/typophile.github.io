  I only post infrequently, but I was puzzled about something lately and had to ask
  ... with all the riffs and homages to Helvetica over the years, hasn't anyone done
  a script version of the typeface? I assumed this would be simple to find, but after
  a bit of searching, I came up with nothing.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that such a face
  could be not only beautiful (and in some ways, funny), but also fill what I perceive
  as a void of highly legible, non-expressive modern script faces.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  a ridiculously rough sketch of what I'm talking about ... I'd love any leads to
  a face like this, and any opinions on whether such a face would be a terrible idea
  or not. Thanks!"

  body: You should try! Keep in mind Helvetica is very straight-up and constructed,
    even in the italic. There are no traits of fluid handwriting, whatsovever, hence
    some of those shapes in your sketch have no business showing themselves in a grotesque.

    several of my solutions are bug-ugly; but I'm curious what a grotesque script
    would look like. I've been surprised by the lack of \"straight-up and constructed\"
    scripts on the market, and think that an italic Helvetica could be a great basis
    to build upon.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is, I'm not actually a font designer myself,
    just a passionate graphic designer who sits around wondering about these kind
    of things."

    but think there's potential even with grotesque forms.

    body: Riccard0, I like this, but it still feels like a "joke font" to me. That
      is, not something I would use for a number of flexible designs. I guess what
      I'm chasing is the (admittedly debatable) neutrality/universality of Helvetica
      in a script face, which I haven't seen enough of to suit my tastes.

    would become a real thing. I know it's a gag font, but I have to admit that I
    thought it could be useful in brightening an occasional universal/humanist design.

    font in real life, so help yourself. As I said, I'm not a type designer. If you're
    actually interested, we could draft up some kind of simple gentleman's agreement
    like a nod my way in the font credits.
