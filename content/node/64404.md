  body: "Maybe you would like to be a bit more specific regarding the problems which
    you have with FontLab? Without knowing what you consider its deficiencies to be,
    it's hard to know what you would consider to be a better program.\r\n\r\nIf you
    don't like how it handles OpenType coding, you can always add that using AFDKO
    directly.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/eula.html\r\n\r\nAlternately,
    you could try FontForge:\r\n\r\nhttp://fontforge.sourceforge.net/mac-install.html\r\n\r\nDTL
    FontMaster is another option, though it represents a significant monetary investment:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thx a lot,\r\n\r\nFontlab crashes and has problems with a lot of code.\r\nI
    know my code can be insane sometimes by ammount but whe had a presentation of
    underware and there code ammount was insane aswell. They use BBedit for coding
    but it's not possible to generate a font that way as far as i know so i gues they
    use AFDKO aswell.\r\n\r\nand for james, yes if only the tools are used that doesnt
    make fontlab crash but for the rest your right."

  body: "Is you complaint about the FLS OT editing window? You can write your code
    in BBEdit, emacs, or whatever editor you prefer and then import the features into
    FLS. For longer code this is probably advisable since the editing capabilities
    of FLS are fairly primitive.\r\n\r\nFLS uses AFDKO for compiling the actual code,
    so the only advantage to using ADFKO directly is that the most recent version
    of ADFKO supports more lookup types than the one included in FLS5, but many of
    the additions to the new ADFKO are not yet supported by many applications.\r\n\r\nAs
    for FLS crashing, while I have run into the occasional crash, I don't think it's
    quite as unstable as some people would make it out to be (it's a big improvement
    over Fontographer -- the platform I started out on). Perhaps I'm just lucky, but
    I've certainly run into commercial software which is far worse. Just make sure
    to save regularly.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "If being brand loyal to particular OS matters less to you than stable FontLab,
    get FontLab for Windows. FLS in Windows almost never crashes. Older versions crashed
    plenty but the latest FLS build is very stable. Sure, there are lots of problems
    but crashing is far down the list because it happens so rarely . . . or I've learned
    to avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe only apps I care about are Chrome and FontLab. So whichever
    OS runs those two apps better is the one I'll use. Right now, that means Windows.
    If those apps run significantly better in another OS, I'll switch."

  body: I hear other Mac users complaining about FontLab being crashy, but it doesn't
    happen very often for me. Maybe I just don't happen to use the features that are
    the most crash-prone. I know certain specific things will do it, but I can only
    think of a few. Just today I discovered that "Save Encoding" leads to the spinning
    beachball of death and had to force quit. I figured out a work-around after a
    few moments thought, so no biggie. But the things I do day in and day out don't
    lead to crashes.

  body: That Fontforge installer was much easier than the several hours it took me
    to install it last time. Does anyone know how to change the interface language.
    The installer and all the menus appear in Japanese; there doesn't seem to be a
    way to change it in the menu.

    need \"tweaking\": you need to install Cygwin. But maybe I chose the wrong link
    to follow - I went to the Sourceforge page itself to avoid accidentally downloading
    the Japanese version.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see that FontLab Studio also does cost a
    fair amount of money - and that it's from the same company that makes Fontographer
    now. I remember that the company that formerly made Fontographer was criticized
    for discontinuing FontMonger, but I see they now have TypeTool, a basic, inexpensive
    font creation program."

    with OS X but isn't installed by default).  See [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/mac-install.html]]
    for full details.

  body: "John, a little clarification on FontLab/Fontographer history: FontLab Ltd.
    (formerly Pyrus) created FontLab (later renamed FontLab Studio) in the early nineties,
    originally for MS-DOS. TypeTool is the \"lite\" version of FontLab Studio. FontLab
    Ltd. acquired the source code and rights to Fontographer a few years ago. Altsys
    created Fontographer in 1986, originally for Mac OS. They also created Freehand.
    Through various acquisitions, Fontographer ended up at Macromedia in the mid-nineties
    where development stopped until FontLab Ltd acquired it.\r\n\r\nAnd, for what
    it's worth, FontLab Studio is not expensive at all if you're using it professionally."
