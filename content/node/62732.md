  body: "The first thing that came to mind was <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/abaddon.font?nb_ppp=50&text=SCORPION\">Abaddon</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/drakon.font?nb_ppp=50&text=SCORPION\">Drakon</a>\r\n\r\nAnother
    idea might be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/girlfriend/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D48%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DSCORPION%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Csingle%26seed%3D22\">Girlfriend</a>.
    Try searching 'halloween' at www.myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nYour sketch is pretty nice...
    have you considered scanning that and drawing the logo by hand in Illustrator?"

    a Dave Nalle adaptation of a typeface by Alex Jay for a 1981 book called \"The
    Dinosaurs\" by William Stout. Jay's type design was inspired by lettering of Alfonse
    Mucha, the Art Nouveau illustrator and graphic artist.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
