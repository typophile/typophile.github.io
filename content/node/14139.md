  body: "<em> I know we all love flash and DHTML</em>\r\n\r\nI have to side with Dan.
    Flash rarely makes a site better. Not necessarily Flash's fault, but that's how
    it seems to go.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree as well, but I do think that flash allows more freedom in terms of
    typography, but since you can't select it (unless it's dynamic, in which case
    your freedom is revoked) it detracts from usablitly.\r\n\r\nPS -- thanks Peter
    for those sites, they look great.\r\n"
