  seems to know what our own font is, let along have it on file anywhere, so I turn
  to you.\r\n\r\nThis is from our standard company logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6305.jpg]\r\n\r\nIts
  very similar to a font called Tachyon from Fonthead Design, but the middle bar in
  the \"R\" of Tacyhon is lower.\r\n\r\nAny help would be very very much appriacted.\r\n\r\nBest
  Regards\r\n\r\nNeil"
