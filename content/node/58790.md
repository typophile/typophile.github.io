  body: The hotdog appears to have done some serious damage to the fork. Not sure
    I'd eat it :-) Thanks for your kind words!

  body: Thanks! Counters are gray because... I liked it? That was pretty much the
    rationale. I do think it adds playfulness. Same in PICNIC where the letters are
    not all the same shade. BTW these were photocopied B/W, so I was trying to create
    impact with contrast and get the most out of the screens I did use.
