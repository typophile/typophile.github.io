  for this image. I guess I'm after a font to suit a 18-25 age demographic. The font
  has to appeal to the stoner, hip hop or student type!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help
  guys.."

    you want to use (Contempory sans, decorative grunge, warm serif or other)

    graffiti, hip hop fonts etc. So....I guess whatever works. The image and font
    is for a relaxation beverage marketed to who I descibed earlier. Thanks! "

    <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1DY\">Cocon</a> or <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1WM8\">Comalle</a>. "

    Scherz doesn't seem to obtain permission to tag other people's property, so there's
    no need to seek his permission for anything. It looks like he's not openly claiming
    that as his work due to rewards being offered for what the Wikipedia page calls
    \"ostensibly\" his work.\r\n\r\nIn my non-binding legal opinion that turtle is
    clearly in the public domain. "

  body: "Regarding what Ray said, I wouldn't dispute that graffiti artists have just
    as much right to the protection of their work as any other artist. In this case
    however, it seems that Ronald Scherz hasn't stepped forward to outright claim
    this as his due to the pending litigation against him that would follow. As it
    is, this work is only rumored to be his. \r\n\r\nIt reminds me somewhat of the
    Shepard Fairey case demonstrating that legal protections are a knife that cuts
    two ways. For Ronald Scherz to claim protection of his rights to the turtle, he
    would have to submit himself to claims of damaging the property of others. Even
    then it would seem to me that the case could be made that by waiting this many
    years the rights to claim ownership have expired. \r\n\r\nPersonally I agree with
    Mr. Shinn and wouldn't touch it with a ten meter pole if there is any connection
    to SARS. I agree very much with Russell as well that it does indeed scream for
    Cooper Black, which is so rarely applicable but so often used."
