  body: "Since this isn't the Lakers actual logo, you do have a chance to find this
    as a font, but I checked MyFonts, Abstract Fonts and Dafont, and the best I could
    find was <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/search/?q=Airlock\">Airlock, Regular</a>,
    which is a stencilized futuristic style that would be pretty close when un-stencilized.\r\n\r\n-

    close. That was the best I could find.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
