  slugs of Futura in lots of sizes and weights. I saw plans for a press in Readymade,
  but doesn't seem to be what I need for setting type. Does anyone know a place where
  I can find plans for such a device?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type

    a small tabletop press like [[http://www.boxcarpress.com/flywheel/manuals/cp-pilot-manual.pdf|C&P]]
    or [[http://www.boxcarpress.com/flywheel/manuals/kelsey-printers-guide.pdf|Kelsey]]?
    You can get them [[http://www.briarpress.org/classifieds/browse?t=38|pretty cheaply
    nowadays]]. Then again, if you are crafty with your hands, you can try [[http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Letterpress-&-Use-It-to-Print-Things/|this]].\r\n\r\nLastly,
    http://briarpress.org is an excellent resource for all things letterpress. Any
    questions you have, could probably be answered there much better then on Typophile.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

    you are not familiar with the letter press stuff, write him an email. He's very
