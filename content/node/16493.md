body: has anyone here upgrated to macromedia's studio 8? If so, what are the advantages
  of upgrading? Is it worth it. In particular, I'm wondering about Dreamweaver. Is
  it any better/more intuitive to use?

  body: Dreamweaver seems faster and more stable, on the Mac at least. It supports
    most CSS stuff now in preview mode.

    for the purchase of Microsoft. Either they will offer the Microsoft applications
    as separate from the Adobe universe or they will intergrate them and some applications
    will be sold (my first guess is Freehand). Until they announce what they are going
    to do I''m not buying anything. Hey Adobe are you listening? '

  body: "Apparently, the type engine in Flash is greatly improved. There is threshhold
    control over anti-aliasing and the pathetic kerning controls have been refined.\r\n\r\nMost
    importantly, perhaps, font rendering in .swf files is supposedly much clearer,
    regardless of positioning.\r\n\r\nI have not yet tried Flash 8 yet myself, but
    some type-sensitive colleagues of mine think it's the biggest improvement yet
    for typographers and designers.\r\n\r\nFrom Macromedia's site:\r\n<cite>FlashType\u2014high-quality
    font rendering engine:\r\nA revolutionary new font rendering engine that provides
    clear, highest-quality font rendering, FlashType makes small fonts look amazingly
    clear and greatly improves readability. Choose from several options for font rendering,
    each optimized for different use cases. Optimize font rendering with the new custom
    anti-aliasing feature in Flash Professional.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs far as Dreamweaver
    goes, I'm not sure. I use <a href=\"http://smultron.sourceforge.net/\">Smultron</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/\">CSS Edit</a>."

    that Mark spoke of. I jump back and forth from skEdit to Dreamweaver, but if you're
    doing straight HTML (no database) and you've got lots of text formatting, Dreamweaver
    is great. Copy and paste from Microsoft Word even retains most formatting with
    Dreamweaver.\r\n\r\nThe text rendering is MUCH better in Flash 8 -- <a href=\"http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/002402.shtml\">check

    8 is an ancient, pre-Photoshop Mac paint program and PixelPaint competitor. (It
    was a descendant of Deluxe Paint, a rather nice Amiga paint program.)\r\n\r\nYes,

  body: "I teach using MM applications and the Studio 8 version of Dreamweaver has
    made my life a lot easier in terms of introducing CSS to my students. Essentially
    Dreamweaver has absorbed TopStylePro (etc.), which sucks for TopStyle, but, as
    I said, makes my life a lot easier as an instructor. It's not just the preview
    improvements, but the simple ability to edit already defined styles in a side-palette
    rather than opening a dialogue box is great. Not to mention that this upgrade
    makes creating and editing ID selector styles (such as \"#idname p, a, h2\") much
    easier to work with than previous versions.\r\n\r\nI'm not a Flash guy, so can't
    comment there, and Fireworks seems pretty much the same, but I do appreciate the
    CSS improvements a lot."

    i remember when the whole thing went down Adobe stated that they plan on keeping
    the Macromedia brand alive (for some time if i remember correctly). That doesn't
    mean they're not working behind the scenes. I suspect that some of the changes
    in studio 8 are due to the minds and talents at Adobe, but I don't know for certain.
    That part of the reason i posed this question in the first place: to see if anyone
    could sense some adobe magic in the new apps. But I guess we can't really know
    that for certain, can we?"

  body: The mac studio 8 is a solid upgrade. Only downside is no Freehand update.
    Dreamweaver and Flash are less buggy than previous versions. Dreamweaver has better
    CSS tools and Flash has script assist for actionscript.
