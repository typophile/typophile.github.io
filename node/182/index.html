		<div class="commentbody">Peter, is that list off the top of your head? If so, it's still helpful, thanks, but could you possibly find something official/methodical for Swedish? That would be great. And even more important than pairs would be word frequencies. All my own data comes from cryptographic and linguistic analysis, which I have access to thanks to UCLA. Except for the Polish data which I can thank Adam Twardoch for. I've been wanting to put it all up on my site, but&hellip; <BR> <BR>BTW, here's an idea: Could we have some kind of repository here on Typophile, where people submit frequency lists (with info about the source)? That would be killer. I'd contribute whatever I had (as long as I find the time to type it in&hellip; Or maybe I can do OCR). <BR> <BR>Ligature Style: <BR>The difference comes from the fact that Thierry is an accomplished calligrapher. And although I'm not a big fan of calligraphy in type design, if tempered it results in some great ligatures, that's for sure. Yeah, some of them are pretty crazy, but remember that you never *have* to use a given ligature, but in any case each one is aesthetically superb. If you look at the &quot;AA&quot; in Mrs Eaves, for example, you can see it doesn't really &quot;sit&quot; very well. In terms of functionality, however, we could argue about which is better: constructed or painted ligatures. And of course that applies to type in general. I happen to think paint is for walls. <BR> <BR>Linguistic Hierarchy: <BR>In terms of Latinate writing systems, the main ones would be, in ~order: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Italian, and after that I wouldn't try to guess. But note that you might consider this order to be somewhat moot, because, for example: there's less piracy in Germany than in general; on the web Dutch has a disproportionate presence; and other factors. <BR> <BR>BTW, concerning &quot;customizing&quot; for languages, more important than ligatures would be spacing/kerning: it can have a very large effect on setting. For example, round-round shape-pairs have a very different frequency in English and French. And in English the word &quot;the&quot; is more common than fully *half* the letters of the alphabet, whereas since it's not as common in Spanish, you might sacrifice its spacing in favor of the &quot;ate&quot; string, for example. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
