  body: Academy looks like Futura. Bistro could be something like Block Gothic Light
    Extra Condensed.

  body: Hmm.. Block Gothic Light Extra Condensed is too heavy. It looks like a cross
    between Block Gothic Extra Light Condensed and Block Gothic Light Extra Condensed.
    Anyone know of another similar font that might work? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bistro_blockgothic_3642.jpg]
