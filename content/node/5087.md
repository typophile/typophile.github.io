  body: I&#39;ll venture a guess that this isn&#39;t a font because it is pixel-perfect.
    I find it doubtful that any existing non pixel-perfect font would render so precisely
    at this size. It&#39;s equally doubtful that anyone would produce a bitmap font
    at this scale ergo it&#39;s probably not a font. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s very cool though.

    quoi... <BR> <BR>Karl, I think it must be, they use it extensively for their catalogues
    and posters i.e.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37551.jpg"

    Even <i>I</i> could make one of those <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
