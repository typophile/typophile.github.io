  body: ' Wow. Rodchenko is pretty sweet. I do like the  <BR>rawness of P22s Constructivist
    but to date I  <BR>haven&#39;t seen anything as raw as Rodchenko&#39;s  <BR>actual
    work. <BR> <BR>Rodchenko&#39;s character widths are all over the  <BR>place and
    lend a handmade feel to his otherwise  <BR>geometric work. I&#39;ll post a sample
    sometime of  <BR>what I mean. '

    a Cyrillic set of Chalet, which is  <BR>beautiful. Somehow the 60s flavor of Chalet
    fits perfectly  <BR>with the Cyrillic alphabet. Worth a look.
