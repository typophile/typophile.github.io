  body: I don't think it bears more than a passing resemblance to Din (the straight
    sided O) - I think it was drawn and cut by hand.

  body: "Sure\u2026 however it\u2019s more like DIN than anything else you\u2019ll
    find.\r\n\r\nGranted the A and the S are way off (and bearing in mind it\u2019s
    plainly obvious that it was hand drawn and cut), but the rest of the glyphs are
    very \u201CDINesque\u201D."

  body: "I agree with both of you. :^)\r\n\r\nIt is probably hand drawn and cut, having
    done a few stencils myself.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced the basis was DIN but as
    Koen needs an \"existing digitised typeface\", I think FF DIN is well placed in
    this regard. You'd have to do a fair bit of customisation and subbing, it's not
    too difficult."
