  beginners the language.\r\n\r\nThe stock fonts are all pretty ugly however I've
  come across some nice ones online. Since this is aimed for beginners new to the
  language, the font has to be clean, easy to understand and written correctly.\r\n\r\nWhat
  is important is that the letters be clearly distinguishable and that the positioning
  of the dots be correct.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions will be appreciated."
