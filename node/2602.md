body: 'INTRODUCTION <BR> <BR>Van is a Sans-Serif  typography with a geometric style.
  <BR>This version is expanded and don&acute;t have contrast between the <BR>different
  types of strokes, giving a uniform esthetic and visual in <BR>each character, word
  or a column of text. <BR>The family of  van typography that is constitued by two
  different <BR>width: normal and condensed wich one have the versions: Ultra Light,
  Light, Regular, Medium, Bold and all the respectives italics versions. I designed
  and plannificated this <BR>typography to use as text and display but I think that
  they must be <BR>corrected to use as font screen because some caracters have more
  <BR>visual impact that others like for exemple LC-V, E, M, Z and SC-a, y. <BR>Figures
  5, 6, 9. All the critics are welcome to corrected and fininshed the work.GIF / JPG:

  body: ' Pretty nice! <BR>I especially like the lightest weight - very elegant. And
    the design as a whole has an appealing individuality without being strange. The
    only glyph that I didn&#39;t like was the lc &#34;g&#34;: although the open-bottom
    bicameral &#34;g&#34; is my favorite form of that letter, I think the head needs
    to be bigger, to match the style of the lc &#34;a&#34; and lc &#34;e&#34;, for
    example. <BR> <BR>Keep it up, <BR>Hrant '

  body: ' Van seems to be coming along nicely. It has some nice nuances. I&#39;m liking
    the condensed regular italic a lot. <BR> <BR>The particulars of the face aside,
    however, I&#39;ve been thinking about some advice I once heard that might be useful--depending
    on how complete your font is I guess. <BR> <BR>The gist of the advice was that
    it&#39;s best not to pursue multiple weights of a face until you have the main
    weight completed and polished. And only when it&#39;s complete would you translate
    it to other weights or widths &#40;bold, light, condensed, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    curious. Would others agree with this advice in general? Would you agree in the
    case of Ricardo&#39;s Van? If you were planning a font with lots of weights and/or
    widths, would you start with the regular weight? <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' Joe, <BR> <BR>In general, yes because it&#39;s a pain to fix multiple faces
    if you decide after the fact to make changes. Shouldn&#39;t the purpose of the
    typefaces dictate their development? For instance if you&#39;re designing a display
    face with a corresponding text version, doesn&#39;t it make sense to not go too
    far with either one before working on the other? '

  body: 'In fact you are totally correct, in this moment it&#39;s the way that i prefer
    to work starting by regular and italic versions to create the others weights &#40;form/space&#41;.
    But Van was a special case, I had to draw all weights because the limits of the
    letters round  - like I show in this last exemple. <BR>If I created the other
    weight from the regular version using Fontographer, all that round properties
    would be destroyed with the transformation, so I prefered to make myself all.
    <BR>Did you notice any strange differnces between the weights? <BR>Thank&#39;s
