<p>it&rsquo;s technically not legal to buy a laptop in the US and bring it into the UK without paying the import duty, but sometimes I order photography gear from B&amp;H in NYC and pay the shipping and import duty and it still is cheaper.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I managed to install and boot Windows XP via Bootcamp; the ATI video driver Apple supplied was unable to set the proper screen resolution for either the laptop display or my external monitor. I tried to update to a not-so-ancient driver and found out I needed to install .net, which required that I install Windows Genuine advantage, which generated some useless error message. So I gave up and went right back to Mac OS.</p>
<p>But I do have a nice working Parallels/XP installation, which I never use because the only Windows apps I want to run are 3D games that don&rsquo;t have Mac ports.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a gamer myself and I&rsquo;m trying to keep a close eye on this, because I generally prefer Macs. So, you&rsquo;ve seen it in action? Is it really comparable? I build my own Windows machines specifically for gaming, so I&rsquo;m looking for real heavy duty horsepower. I gather the price difference is still steep and the advancements in card tech for Macs are a bit behind. If I can see Parallels and BootCamp working well, I may take the hit anyway. But I&rsquo;m always interested in hearing about hands-on experience.</p>

<p>I run all of that via DVI to my Apple 20&quot; monitor, which is a glorious way to game, let me tell you. I may never stop, as building the PC is a big part of the fun for me, and it keeps me up to date on the latest tech. However, if I could run HL2 on a macbook&hellip;oh, man would I ever love that.

<p>Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m not sure. I think a little under $800. That was for the case w/ power supply, RAM, processor, motherboard, graphics card&hellip;and possibly the wireless card, but I&rsquo;m not sure. The rest I carried over from my old machine. Like you, I didn&rsquo;t keep close track. The first time I did it was quite some time ago. I think it was $600 or so, but without the case or wireless card. I try to build machines that have solid benchmarks and long-term performance, but are still below the insane premiums you pay for the absolute latest tech (like $500 graphics cards). Reading up on benchmarks has really helped me find just the right graphics cards to balance cost and performance.</p>
