  make a fake issue of EYE magazine. I decided to use 9pt as my default text size.
  but there was something that I've been stuck on.. which serif font should I use?
  for now I'm using Times and thankfully my professor gave me another chance to come
  up with a better serif font. I need you guys advice; which font should I use? I
  was thinking garamond?"
