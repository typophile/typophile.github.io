  Triplex regular, it's so sloppy and goofy, specially on headlines.\r\n\r\nSo please
  suggest some regular (not italic) sans serif companions.\r\n\r\nTriplex Italic and
  it's match will be runing side by side so they must have a similar color and character.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would you suggest?\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    be another by John Downer, [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/SamSans|SamSans]]. As
    you know the regular of Triplex is not by Downer, but Licko.  '
