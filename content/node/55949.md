  body: "Kepler was previously issued as a Multiple Master font by Adobe, and the
    'a' had a shorter tail like this one. The 'g' is open in Kepler, but it's only
    obvious at larger sizes. It's especially apparent in the MM version samples shown
    in FontBook98. Adobe fonts vanished from the newest FontBook. I think I have the
    MM Kepler, and maybe I can re-create this lettering later, but I think Lex has
    nailed it. It's just that maybe they were using the older MM version.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Here is a slightly squooshed version of the Regular interpolation of Kepler
    MM. The newer Illustrator doesn't have the ability to use the full MM capabilities
    that you had originally, when you could use a slider to pick any weight and width,
    so I had to pick the closest I could manage from the built in interpolations,
    and then condense it slightly. The nominal 'Regular' width was 575, and this sample
    I made was about 550. I think Kepler MM is what they used, and maybe they still
    had old software that let them have full flexibility, or else they did something
    similar to what I tried to do.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AgajaniaKeplerMM_4965.gif]"

    is so\r\nmuch better than the usual squooshed Times!\r\n\r\nPlus, you guys probably
    don't see this, but\r\nthe designer seems to have snuck in a subtle\r\nreference
    to the Armenian flag...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
