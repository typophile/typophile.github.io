<div class=commentbody>Naah. Wes Wilson, poster for The Association. <br> <br><a href=http://www.olsenart.com/bg018.html target=_top>http://www.olsenart.com/bg018.html</a> <br> <br>The book cover is a relatively crappy attempt to combine this poster with Milton Glaser's Dylan poster (with psychedelic hair). The tee is a much better homage (although it loses out on what Wilson, Moscoso, and Albers knew so well about color vibrations). <br> <br>And it IS homage: I don't think that this design is trying to fool us into thinking this is something altogether new, but referencing a strong work of design history.</div>

<div class=commentbody> "More art than design..."? What exactly does that <br>mean? And why make a distinction in this case? Do <br>you make a distinction because it's illustrative? <br>Because it's custom drawn and not a font? Why would <br>this make it art and not design? And is that bad? Is it <br>bad English to run this many questions in a paragraph? <br> <br>Re: color vibrations.

<div class=commentbody> >I think it rises to a new level. <br> <br>I disagree entirely. "design is a good idea" is a pun. The double meanings are: 1) that it is a good idea to design things and that, 2) the term design can be defined as the execution of "a good idea." <br> <br>Whereas: "kerning is a good idea" simply means that it is a good idea to kern. The pun is lost. Worse, the idea and the design for the shirt is ripped-off making the attempted parody an awkward and embarassing imitation of a superior original. It lacks any sensitivity or understanding of the original concept. </div>

<div class=commentbody> homage to me relates to something someone did as a gift or show of respect in your own way not imitation. <br> <br>Charles Demuth's painting "I saw the figure five in gold" payed homage to his friend William Carlos Williams's the poet who had a poem by the same name. <br> <br>Albers and his 'homage to the square' series showed his respect in his way (to make visual) geometry, color, and mathematical representation before concept. <br> <br>homage does not mean copy </div>

<div class=commentbody> I remember the first time I saw the Demuth that Tanya is referring to. I was in the Met and I was literally frozen in my tracks. A Williams fan, I recognized the reference even before reading the title. It's such a masterful and tasteful visual interpretation of verse. A true homage. <br> <br>I don't think the "kerning is a good idea" submission even begins to approach that same level of sophistication. And I disagree that the whole point is the context of the original. It's just another example of designers failing to really appreciate the power of the written word. Unlike "I Saw the Figure Five in Gold" which sensitively captures the color and rhythm of Williams' verse, the "kerning" example merely parrots the look of its predecessor. <br> <br>Literacy is the first skill of a good designer. Without it we're merely aimless decorators. </div>

They even made a poster saying "blah blah blah NOWHERE NEAR KERNING". Get it? <br> <br>Or are you perhaps overly sensitive to anything that parodizes Emigre, or maybe parodizes the value of Design (expressed in the original)?

<div class=commentbody> yay. another Demuth fan. I payed homage to Demuth focusing on his visual, altering the fonts, simplying the painting and inking it black on my shoulder. only 1 lady, about 60yrs old at a folk cafe has ever recognized it, walked by said, 'I love Demuth too' and left. <br> <br>again homage means you can appreciate and do not, absolutely would not, even think of, imitating it. to borrow someones concept for any other purpose (advertising typophile in this case) is almost an insult not a parody. <br> <br>it smells of those Microdot (for microsoft) and other knock-off t-shirts in the head shops. </div>
