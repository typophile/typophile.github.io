  body: From the C and A especially, it must have been based on a Caslon. <BR>Tim

  body: I disagree about Caslon, because it seems to me only the A and C have any
    sort of Caslon similarity -- the other letters are much more like a classic Roman
    titling type. &#40;My copy of the FontBook is not handy, or I might suggest a
    few similar ones.&#41; <BR> <BR>FWIW, AMICA is listed as a client of Font Bureau,
    although this typeface doesn&#39;t resemble any FB styles I have seen.

  body: 'Thank you both for your input.  <BR> <BR>From what I was able to find online,
    there are several Amica magazines; one of which is German: <BR><a href="http://www.madonnatribe.com/images_covers/amica_2000.JPG"

    <BR>Probably FontBureau worked with them? The mast looks like Agenda to me.'

    that for the New York Times Magazine, but I don&#39;t know if this is the same
    one.

  body: Mark is right - it looks very much like the NYT mag&#39;s redesign of Cheltenham,
    which is not &#40;as far as I know&#41; commercially available. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25489.html"

  body: 'Went out and bought the magazine today. Here is a scan from one of the pages.
    I am almost sure now it is the custom work by FontBureau Mike and Mark mentioned.
    It is a beautiful and exquisite face in my opinion. <BR> <BR>The other FontBureau
    typefaces used in the magazine: FB Agenda Light and FB Agenda Regular &#40;for
    captions and short paragraphs&#41;, FB Giza Seven Five &#40;from what I can tell&#41;
    for some of the titles. <BR> <BR>Can anyone provide a scan of the NY Times version
    of the font? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69155.gif"

    is quite as light as this&#41; but it won&#39;t arrive on my doorstep until saturday
    morning, hope you can wait until then. <BR> <BR>That lower case g is definitely
    Cheltenham.

    light as this. <BR> <BR>That lower case g confirms its Cheltenham origins.
