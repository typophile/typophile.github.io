body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI was wondering what kind of font we usually use on our diploma
  like the one below but disregard the shadow. It looks like Old English or even from
  a calligraphy...and why it seems we only use on diploma but not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nAK\r\n\r\n\r\n<img

    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/black-swan/|Black Swan]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/ruca/|Ruca]].
    Have also a look to [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/|Dieter
    Steffman''s]] work, he has a lot of blackletter fonts...'
