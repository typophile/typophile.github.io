  body: ' Those numbers are not any given typeface. They are from a mechanical auto-incrementing
    numbering device used on letterpress equipment. The name &#34;Crash Numbering&#34;
    comes from the process called &#34;crash printing&#34; which involves imprinting
    a number &#40;or other information&#41; on a multipage form after all the pages
    of the form are assembled. '
