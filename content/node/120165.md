  trying to replicate a sign for my father-in-law's old business. Photos are from
  letter head and ashtray. The font is normally not degraded but it's a magnified
  photo on linen paper.\r\n\r\nIt's similar to Marlowe Cocktail and Yasashii but certainly
  neither of those. Thanks in advance."

    and the letterhead was engraved. Not certain as to the technique for the ashtray.
    \r\nI agree with your call of Yasashii as a similar that could be adapted.\r\nYou
    might also look at Ultra Modern http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/ultra-modern-rr/
    for ideas as to how to do additional letters if you want to extend the alphabet.\r\nDon"
