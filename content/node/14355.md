  body: My guess is custom lettering -- but some signs point to influence of Helvetica
    Light (turn that M sideways and you'll see what I mean ;)) and also House's Chalet
    series.

  body: The M looks like Helvetica's "3" turned sideways.. and the 1 for the "I" matches
    Helvetica, too.. so I'm guessing it is just a strange, customized mix-n-match
    of Helvetica and Chalet.

  body: "Wow, that's pretty good. The things I noticed, however, are ...\r\n\r\n-
    The \"1\" in Helvetica needed a bit of tweaking to get it looking right.\r\n-
    The \"u\" and \"h\" in Chalet don't look like those in the image.\r\n\r\nThank
    you, by the way.  :)"
