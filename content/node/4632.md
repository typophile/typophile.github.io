  target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/twifly/webpage.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having
  a problem with some webpages displaying in this very hard-to-read font...it seems
  my browser is defaulting to it instead of Arial &#40;which is what I&#39;ve set
  as the default font&#41;.  I&#39;ve tried 2 different browsers &amp; it doesn&#39;t
  matter...I still get this same font on certain pages.  So I&#39;d like to take it
  out of my fonts folder and see if that helps. <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

    that font my browser has replaced it with another, equally hard-to-read font :\

  body: Twila, <BR>That 2bead.com web page&#39;s HTML specifies only &#34;sans-serif&#34;.
    If you&#39;re not using Windows, then disregard what follows ... <BR> <BR>In Windows,
    at least, the typeface used when the operating system or a program calls for sans
    serif is, I believe, set by the operating system to default to the ugly MS Sans
    Serif bitmap font. It sounds as if maybe yours is missing and so some other, possibly
    random, font is used. See if you have MS Sans Serif in your Fonts folder. It will
    likely have a different icon than the TrueType fonts. Note that you should also
    have a MS Serif bitmap font in that fonts folder for when a call for simply serif
    is made. <BR> <BR>The font you set as the default in Internet Explorer only applies
    when a website doesn&#39;t specify any font at all. <BR><br>
