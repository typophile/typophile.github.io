body: "So in this academic volume I'm typesetting, an author has specified a character
  he needs in his transcription of an original manuscript from the 1700s. The thing
  should look something like an uppercase \"Y\" rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees,
  or a lambda mirrored and rotated the other way. I'm assuming this signifies something
  other than \xABthe original author has written a rotated \"Y\"\xBB, but I'm not
  sure what. \r\nIt might be related to either Latin (more likely) or Greek (which
  occurs after it in the text as can be seen below).\r\nI have a couple of handwritten
  renditions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rotated_Y_1_4772.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rotated_Y_1zoom_4364.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rotated_Y_2_3580.jpg]\r\n.\r\nIs
  anyone here familiar with this symbol and where/how to find/make it?\r\nThanks."

    he published in the late 18th century, dealing with Homer and the question of
    his authorship of both the Iliad and the Odyssey. Also, there's an annotation
    a bit further on (that number 7 above) that mentions \"error-free passage/section\"
    \u2013 it's not clear to me if that might have anything directly to do with the

    http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3bn592k6#page-1. They call it \"DOTTED RIGHT-POINTING
