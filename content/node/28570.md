  body: "It is similar to Simoncini Garamond,as you said, but the 6 in your sample
    is closed, and the 7 has a serif and a heavier taper to the leg than Simoncini.\r\n\r\nI
    think they look like the numerals from <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cheltenham-old-style-no-2/\">Cheltenham
    Old Style</a>, but I haven't looked at every serif font. Still, this seems like
    a closer match -- see the 3, 2, 5, 7 and 8, for example.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
