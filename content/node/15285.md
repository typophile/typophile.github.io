  seems able to do this, and it claims to preserve all character outlines, metrics

  body: Did that work out okay Palatine? I am looking for a program to convert some
    of my PC fonts to my mac, as I just made the switch over.. Anyone know how I would
    convert .PFB and .PFM to something I can use on my mac without losing any of the
    metrics?

  body: "Well... Any program which converts PST1 to a PST1 CFF-flavoured OpenType
    font shouldn't touch the nodes of a glyph or its metrics, and it should grab the
    kern table and turn it into a kern feature. (Although it will probably do a \"standard\"
    1:1 kern table with a line of code for each kern pair. A bit of a waste of OpenType
    functionailty, but there you go.)\r\n\r\nSo, Palatine, there should be no degradation
    at all. Conerting Type 1 to TrueType curves might result in some changes, however.\r\n\r\nI
    use TransType for Mac from Pyrus software to do conversions, although this doesn't
    always work. (Depending upon the font family and member naming.) In which case
    I go to FontLab.\r\n\r\nNow, I hate to be a spoilsport, but have you checked the
    EULAs for the fonts you plan to convert? Some foundries don't allow this kind
    of thing. (It's often referred to as \"decompilation\", and some foundries will
    wag their fingers and make \"tsk\" sounds if you even consider doing it to their
    fonts.)"
