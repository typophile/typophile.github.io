body: "Hi everyone, \r\n\r\nI'm working on a school assignment where my teacher gave
  me a sample of a font he thinks I could use for my  project. However I have no idea
  which font it is and so far all the ones I've tried are always just a little different
  and not right for my project.\r\n\r\nI hope someone here can help me identify the
  font.\r\n\r\nThe sample is an old French map from 1942, used by the military back
  then. Since the file itself is rather large, I copied some of the text into a new
  file. I hope this image has enough information for someone to be able to help me.

  much appreciated !!!\r\n\r\ngrts, Elke from Belgium"

    thanks for the Chivo type, that's close to what I'm looking for :)\r\n\r\nElke"

  body: "I still haven't found the right font for my project and my teacher wants
    me to identify the exact font used in the sample he gave me.\r\n\r\nI thought
    I might be able to identify the font by researching which fonts were commonly
    used in the 1940 on printing presses, but so far no luck....\r\n\r\nI'm posting
    the original file my teacher gave me, hoping that someone might be able to help
    me. \r\nAs said there are several fonts in the file, a sans serif and a serif.
    \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_4847.jpg]\r\n\r\nI really hope
    someone can help me with this.\r\nOr if anyone could tell me which fonts were
    most used in the 1940, then maybe I could narrow it down from there...\r\n\r\ngrts,

    Artur Schmal\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ourtype/parry_grotesque_pro_semi_bold/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=40&sample_text=Chaumont%20Rochefort&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\">Parry
    (Grotesque)</a> and Fred Smeijers\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ourtype/ludwig_pro_normal/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=40&sample_text=Chaumont%20Rochefort&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\">Ludwig</a>.
    The latter even has an alternate two-storey \u2018g\u2019.\r\n\r\nTo replace the
    serif, something like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_elementa_pro/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=40&sample_text=Queue%20de%20Cheval&ft=liga\">Elementa</a>
    might work."
