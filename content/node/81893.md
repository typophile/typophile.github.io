  Photography books]]. I initially thought Bembo but it is far more rounded, then
  I thought garamond but the W is different.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yhst-30868769906465_2152_28578220_6184.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yhst-30868769906465_2152_57734806_5527.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yhst-30868769906465_2153_33649619_3424.gif]"

  body: "It's very difficult to see the details well enough. Any chance to see a closeup
    of the lettering? The l.c. w seems to have the backward curves that some Monotype
    fonts have, but it would be much easier to have an idea with a clearer sample.\r\n\r\nAre
    there pages that show the Roman text? That is much easier to identify, generally.\r\n\r\n-
