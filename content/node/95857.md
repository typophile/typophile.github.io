  body: "Can't find an exact match. Can be wrong but looks like a custom job based
    on some kind of Helvetica-like font. I would probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/bold/|Helvetica
    Bold]], recreating /w (ascenderless mirrored /m), /h (mix of mirrored /n and /f),
    /a (/d with a reduced ascender - note its ascender is not horizontally aligned
    with the next /n, what probably could accredit the customization) and /t (mirrored
    f with pulled up middle bar)\r\nSame vein, probably effortless but not matching:
    [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/collections/chalet|Chalet]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/parangon/|Parangon]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-bq/|AG Schoolbook]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-schulbuch/|FF

      as a jpg and we need to use it across a range of things... (and they're not
      prepared to change to something else) I suspect it's a free-font from the murky
      depths of the interwebs but thought someone might have seen it somewhere.. \r\n\r\nthanks
      both for your help."
