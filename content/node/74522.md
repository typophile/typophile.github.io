  fonts_5221.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm mostly interested in the font(s) of the \"only\" and
  \"on iStock\" parts, but the font of \"Find something extra special...\" would be
  interesting, too.\r\n\r\nEven if you shouldn't know exactly what the fonts are called,
  I'd be interested in similar fonts, too.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
