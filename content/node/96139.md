  not named as they used to be, ie. Kcommaaccent is now uni0136, and all other commaaccent
  glyphs are not 'named' in the font or glyph window either. Why has this changed,
  have I accidentally changed preferences somehow?\r\n\r\nAny answers welcome. Thanks."

  body: Mine changed too, so I doubt it's your preferences. It's either an upgrade
    in Fontlab, or it might have happened (for me at least) when I installed Fontographer
    demo to get different different encoding options for the font window. It's a little
    annoying because double clicking on the cell no longer automatically puts the
    components in there.

    changed -- a mapping from Unicode numbers to common glyph names."

    working with the new names, you could add some definitions to the alias.dat file
    (which apparently was not updated to reflect the changes to the encoding tables).
    Add lines for commaaccent characters such as:\r\n<pre>\r\nuni0122 G+commaccent\r\nuni0136
    K+commaaccent\r\nuni013B L+commaaccent\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe file is in FL's global
    Data folder\u2014 try <code>/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Data</code> on
    Mac, or <code>\\My Documents\\FontLab\\Shared\\Data</code> on Windows, or just
    run a search. "
