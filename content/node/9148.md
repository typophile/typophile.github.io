body: After looking at one of the books by Mr Tufte with a colleague, we couldn&#39;t
  figure out how the thing was printed. It was set in Monotype Bembo and I have heard
  that it isn&#39;t digital. Does anyone know any details on the production/printing
  of his books?

  body: I wonder if Monotype Imaging knows about ETBembo? While licensing contracts
    often don&#39;t condone altering a font, it certainly is a violation of contract
    to alter a font AND claim it for yourself. <BR> <BR>The earlier Tufte books were
    set by Michael Bixler in metal Monotype Bembo. They were printed photo offset
    from the composition proofs. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: I note that Tufte does not say that he altered the Monotype version of Bembo,
    but rather that it was a Bembo-like font designed by him and a couple of other
    folks. Whether he started with the Monotype font or not is unclear, but it seems
    to be implied that he didn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Not that I&#39;m making any statement
    about whether it&#39;s legally or ethically okay, in either case. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: '&#62;the computer people ignored &#34;squeeze,&#34; the slight spreading
    of ink when the lead type hits the paper <BR> <BR>Like many people who don&#39;t
    experiment much with typesetting &#40;especially book designers&#41;, Mr Tufte
    expects digital versions of the well known faces to duplicate the effect of letterpress.
    <BR> <BR>In the first place, this is not necessarily what the digital foundries
    set out to do. Secondly, it&#39;s not easy, and reviving a classic in such a manner
    may not be as good an idea as making a new face, eg Scala or Charter, to tackle
    the problem of &#34;digital to offset&#34;. <BR> <BR>Thirdly, if the complainants
    took a little more time to research the topic &#40;or employ someone to do same,
    or post on Typophile&#41; they would discover that there are many less-known versions
    of the classics which address the &#34;good as letterpress&#34; problem, eg Founders
    Caslon, MvB Verdigris, and several Shinn typefaces to boot. &#34;Jenson&#34; has
    been revised at least a dozen times: surely book publishers can find one of the
    digital versions that is compatible with their needs. Sorry, no quick answers,
    this IS rocket science, after all. <BR> <BR>BTW, the magnificent Monotype Bembo
    was their second attempt at the Griffo font, Poliphilus was the first, and they
    were pretty happy with it for a while.'
