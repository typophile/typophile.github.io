  elegant & geometric typeface such as Bodoni. Can be a bit more avantgarde.\r\nI'd
  use Bodoni but somehow I feel it's been used and abused, so I'd be grateful for
  any suggestions of fonts that would create the same effect, but are bit \"fresher\"
  for the eye.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\n.a\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's for the titles and quotations, the text is in Verlag Book, or whichever
    sans serif that "sits" nice next to Bodoni.

    (has a wee bit of Life BT in it).\r\nJos Buivenga's Geotica."
