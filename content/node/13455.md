  body: Thanks all for the prompt response. I guess most specifically I am looking
    for a list that also lists according to region. For example, if a lived in New
    Delhi or New Jersey and was trying to find a regional foundry. Is there a faster
    way to determine this without clicking on every individual foundry?
