  body: 'According to creation date, the first font design could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/mata|Mata]]
    by Greg Samata in 2002. First Spiderman movie is also from 2002. DaFont states
    Homoarakhn came before 2005 (probably a personal attempt to recreate Spiderman
    logo as font). Followed by [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/zosma|Zosma]]
    (slightly different, which include an italic version) in 2005. It has been successively
    adapted to create [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/microsoft-xbox-4|XBOX4]]
    and [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/sony-playstation-3|Playstation 3]]
    logos. '

    \"better solution\"), not that Defiantone's answer was wrong and had to be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI
    know that Luc misspelled \"Homoarakhn\" but I let it pass.\r\n\r\nHrant, you may
    have the last post."
