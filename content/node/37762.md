body: "Long story short, I have no real knowledge of fonts. I have a client that sent
  over some designs and uses OPTI Carmella Hand Script\r\n\r\nsearch online + chatting
  with a few in the design industry + reading some posts here basically resulted in
  finding out that OPTI just stole some fonts, and repackaged them. \r\n\r\nHowever...
  More research showed that OPTI ripped off Julia Script, but when i go to the sites
  that sell Julia (only one version came up), it looks nothing like the OPTI version
  (please take that last line in context... i know nothign about fonts--to me as a
  layperson it doesn't look like the same font, and my client will not like it).\r\n\r\nSo
  i'm hoping someone here can provide a little guidance. I'm trying to do right, and
  would appreciate any guidance provided."

  body: Wow, that looks VERY much like it, i have only seen a few words written in
    the Carmella (i'd hate to have to read a long document in that font) but it's
    great and i tried it out and the two words appear the same. thanks!
