  by Jorge Luis Borge as a school assignment. (studying graphic design.)\r\nhttp://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel\r\n\r\nI\xB4m
  about to decide on a font.\r\nIn the story Borge describes the font used in all
  the books in the library:\r\n\r\n\"To perceive the distance between the divine and
  the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible
  hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual,
  delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical. \"\r\n\r\nJust by reading this
  description, what would you say the font could be?\r\n\r\nI\xB4m thinking a serif,
  and something really classical, like Garamond, Baskerville, Caslon, or maybe Bembo?\r\n(based
  on that the library has a infinite feel to it, and that the books are quite big.)\r\n\r\nBut
  would be interesting to hear what you think!\r\nthanks!\r\nBest\r\nG"

  body: "In Didone style typefaces the \u2018o\u2019 has a vertical symmetry axis.
    In most typefaces of that style b and d as well as p and q are almost mirror imaged.
    The relatively thin serifs at the top of the ascenders do not really contribute
    to a strong asymmetrical impression. In many cases the counters of these characters,
    as well as those of n, m and u look quite symmetrical. Especially when compared
    with the Garalde style. Geometric Sans Serif may be fairly symmetrical when it
    comes to u, j and t (as in Futura), as well as i, v, w and x, but that\u2019s
    about it. In geometric sans serif design it is of course possible to come up with
    a symmetrical n and m as well, but then the typeface would have looked as revolutionary
    as the typefaces Herbert Bayer and Joost Schmidt designed during the Bauhaus Dessau
    era. Herbert Bayer used it for the title of \xBBdie neue line\xAB and both of
    them used such designs for the lettering in exhibition design and posters, but
    these rather experimental designs heave never been available as metal type back
    then, let alone in text sizes.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d be surprised if Borges thought
    of a sans serif typeface anyway. After all, his story was first published in 1941.
    At that time there were hardly any books printed with a sans serif as a text typeface.
    If he would have really imagined the books being printed in sans serif, that would
    have been quite a revolutionary statement for that time and I think he would thus
    have described that idea more precise. \r\n\r\nAlso we have to take into account
    that at that time, Garalde typefaces were a relatively young phenomenon. Most
    of the revivals of that style came into the market into the early 1920s. Especially
    in Europe were WWII will have kept many printers from buying new typesetting machines
    and typefaces for some time. And, like it or not, the typical 19th century book
    face is Didonic. Most books known to Borges in 1941 will have been set in Didonic
    typefaces. Many of these will have had bracketed serifs, but that alone does not
    make their appearance less symmetrical.\r\n\r\nDidonic typefaces have a bad image
    when it comes to legibility, but we have to take into account that this idea is
    largely fed by the far too thin versions of the 20th century. This was mainly
    caused by poorly handled pantographs, phototype versions rendered from artwork
    for large sizes etc. Also the smoother paper of the 19th and 20th century had
    already caused many typefaces to look thinner than originally intended.\r\n\r\nToday,
    well designed optical sizes for smaller typefaces may do a remarkably good job,
    especially for the Didonic style."

    convinced it\xB4s a didonic typeface I\xB4m after. Especially:  \r\n\"In most
    typefaces of that style b and d as well as p and q are almost mirror imaged\"\r\n\r\nTo
    me this is perfect since Borge frequently mentions mirrors in his stories, also
    in \"The Library of Babel\":\r\n\r\n\"In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully
    duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library
    is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream
    that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite...\"\r\n\r\nDo you
    have any suggestion for a great \"modern\" didone that would do a great job in
    my book? I\xB4m going to follow the rules mentioned in Borges story, i.e: \r\n\"Each
    book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of
    some eighty letters which are black in color.\"\r\nProbably set at a pretty large
    size, something like 12/16pt. Havn\xB4t got that far yet...\r\n\r\nOnce again,

  body: "FontShop\u2019s [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif_bracketed_modern_text/|Modern
    bracketed serif]] list shows the right category, I think.\r\n\r\nThinking within
    that category but not excluding the usually non-bracketed Didonic style: [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=century+expanded&q=Go|Century
    Expanded]] is not bad, [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=miller+text&q=Go|Miller
    Text]] is better but in both cases the descenders are too short for longer texts.
    I have the same problem with the regular weight of [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames/viewfonts|Eames
    Century Modern]]. Besides of that, the italic with its tightly-knit begin- and
    end strokes is far too nervous for book typography. [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=new+century+schoolbook&q=Go|(New)
    Century Schoolbook]] may be slightly more appropriate. [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Bodoni+Twelve&q=Go|ITC
    Bodoni Twelve]] looks OK, but it may be too quirky for Borges rationalist attitude.
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kepler/|Kepler]] is more regular, but tends
    too much to the transitional style. Less transitional than one might expect from
    the way it is usually classified is Baskerville. A version of Baskerville with
    the appropriate lower contrast needed for text sizes could probably do a great
    job here. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-book-pro/|Berthold
    Baskerville Book]] has the right colour I think. The same goes for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-pro/|Berthold
    Baskerville]], but it is rather clumsy compared with the Book version, the italic
    is too dark and the bolder weights lack contrast. That typeface family does not
    have that much in common with Baskerville anyway. One should be aware of the fact
    that foundries such as URW and Linotype sell Berthold Baskerville as Baskerville
    too, but that does not make them much better. Monotype and ITC Baskerville are
    far too light [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/baskerville-classico/|Linotype\u2019s
    Baskerville Classico]] looks decent, but one has to put it to the test to make
    shure.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would do some testing with [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cellini_ot/ot_ps|FF
    Cellini]] by Albert Boton. Especially because it has the typical 19th century
    rationalist look, which is a bit more condensed."

  body: "Caledonia is a beautiful typeface, but a bit skinny when compared to the
    metal version. I think that the hairlines of New Caledonia LT are a bit too thin
    for a text typeface. I also like Berthold Walbaum Book, but I think the stem are
    a bit too dark. Makes it too spotty / sparkling for a text typeface. Berthold
    Walbaum Standard is much better as a text typeface, also much better than the
    Monotype version which is too skinny. Also I think that Justus Erich Walbaum would
    probably rotate in his grave if he\u2019d see how quirky that interpretation is.
    The disadvantage of Berthold Walbaum Standard might be slope of the italic. It
    provides a clear contrast to the roman, but at the risk of creating too much unrest
    on the page.\r\n\r\nWhen you need a typeface for student project, some foundries
    may supply you with a \u2018student license\u2019. Usually that means that you
    do not have to pay for it, but are not allowed to use it after having finished
    your study and for commercial projects. Give it a try at the foundry in question,
    I\u2019d say \u2026\r\n\r\nWhen classifying according to Thibaudeau, Baskerville
    clearly belongs into the Didot group."
