  Mono]]. I'm using Simplon Mono Bold and Light in headings for a corporate identity,
  but it is not yet available as a webfont.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-mono/|DIN
  Mono]] is my best alternative, but it feels rather bland in comparison.. Any better?\r\n\r\nThanks:-)"
