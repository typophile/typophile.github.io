    und Layout im web&#34; by Ulli Neutzling <BR><a href="http://www.typo-und-layout-im-web.de"
    target="_blank">www.typo-und-layout-im-web.de</a> <BR>The book helped me, as I
    was working on a project a couple  <BR>of years ago but since the web is such
    a versatil medium I don&#39;t  <BR>know which one is good in the moment. <BR>So
    I think I join you in the question about  excelent books, updated  <BR>and in
    english about typography in relation to website design. <BR>Any sugestions? <BR>
    <BR>Thanks  <BR> <BR>  <BR>Patricia'

    surge of despair. I don&#39;t think a good book on &#34;excellent web typography&#34;
    exists, largely because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. That said, there&#39;s
    an interesting article on readability on the web in the most recent issue of <a
    href="http://www.magtypo.cz">TYPO</a> magazine, #13.'
