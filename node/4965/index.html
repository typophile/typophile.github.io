<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I was expressing a gut feeling in <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36583.html?1085364787 target=_blank>another thread</a> concerning congenial typographic interpretations. <br> <br>Thomas Phinney wrote <i>Indeed, if the typeface choice doesn't need to resonate with its content in any way, we wouldn't need more than a handful of functional typefaces in the world.</i> <br>Yes indeed. <br> <br>I've found that any <i>typeface of worth</i>, like Berthold's Garamond for example, would serve a detective story, or a historical text just as well as a science fiction novel or <i>pretty much anything</i>. <br> <br>The trick is to use that one typeface as sensitive and sensible as possible, not choose between hundreds and hundreds. That's skill. That's what I think a good typographer should do. <br>And that has been my experience. <br> <br>My comment in the other thread may have sounded severe, but please note that this mainly concerns book typography. I have nothing against more expressive typography <i>per se</i>. <br> <br>And if you have some good examples where crazy typefaces enhance crazy content in sweet harmony, please allow me to make some exceptions to my rule. <br> <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I don't think there is really a dichotomy here. <br> <br>I doubt whether we do <i>need</i> more than a handful of functional typefaces (for book typography, at least). But the fact is, we <i>have</i> more than a handful. Precisely because no one typeface stands head and shoulders above the others on any functional grounds (many work pretty well), we will continue to have a choice. <br> <br>In these circumstances, to insist on using just one typeface for everything is itself a choice. <br> <br>Among the many choices a designer makes, choice of typeface may well be relatively unimportant. But there is no reason in principle why a designer may not use a variety of different typefaces and use them all with sensitivity and care. Admittedly, excessive promiscuity may be a bad idea (because it often takes a while to get the "hang" of a particular typeface); but within reason choice may be good. If it helps the designer to keep fresh and enthusiastic, that may be good too. <br> <br>How then to choose? For a whole range of reasons. Some technical (lots of information, little space; narrow columns; need oldstyle figures or not; need bold or not; need small caps or not); some personal (I like this type, not that). I see no reason why allusiveness and resonance to subject or period <i>should not</i> form part of these considerations, if you want them to. <br> <br>If there are no such resonances then, at worst, those who believe there are will be selecting usable type for the wrong reasons. They are deluding themselves in supposing that their careful allusiveness adds anything, but it is a harmless delusion. Rot only sets in if it leads to the choice of faces which are functionally poor; but I see no reason to suppose, given the range of acceptable faces available, why that should happen.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul, <br>obviously I agree. I'm no typographic monk (although Johannes Itten did sport a mean robe). <br>My intent was more of a <i>Hold your horses!</i> when it comes to the kind of studied approach to typography shown in the thread I <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36583.html?1085364787 target=_blank>linked</a> in my first post. <br>Seen in that context I hope you understand my point of view. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Ultimately, I agree that a legible, functional typeface is of the utmost importance, over all subtler considerations. However, it's hardly an argument to stop making new faces, redundant or not, nor an argument to stop paying attention to finer details when circumstances allow. But that's another discussion. <br> <br>As for crazy content, I believe I've posted about this novel on Typophile before, but I'll bring it up again: Mark Z. Danielewski's <i><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=AQv1v3Mqi6&isbn=0375703764&itm=1">House of Leaves</a></i> is, in my direct experience, a great example of a variety of typefaces (most of which are quite common and non-crazy) used in a crazy way, along with one more expressive (read as: distressed) typeface used for content generated by a character who is literally going crazy. <br> <br>The effects are not necessary for communication, but really add a lot. I recommend checking it out in a bookstore if you have the opportunity. The more standard book typesetting leaves something to be desired, but the layout acrobatics required to deal with the literally and intentionally labrynthian narrative are impressive in their own right. It's a good example of fine book typography taking a back seat to just about every other consideration while not damaging the experience too dramatically as a result. The reading experience is so broken up by physical and narrative jumps that it becomes quite minor, in fact (not much extended, continous reading). <br> <br>It's hard to explain what I mean without the book on hand, but it's a very interesting special case in book typography.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>In the realm of display type, few would doubt that "expression" is valuable in a font, which means we can never have enough of them. In the text realm there is indeed reason to doubt the usefulness of more than a handful of fonts, because immersive reading precludes conscious aesthetic impressions. In fact it might seem that the only good reason to make a new text fonts is to solve emerging technical issues. <br> <br>But when you take into account that the <i>subconscious</i> is also open to being "impressed" (albeit in a very different way than the consciousness), you realize that it's really mostly a matter of subtlety, not exclusion, of features. This is why everything has to be toned down in a text font: first it has to "go below the radar" of the consciousness, for it to have any hope of marking its effect in immersive reading. <br> <br>In the subsoncious, more "primal" things matter. For example, sharp corners say something and soft coners say something else, no matter that the reader can't verbalize -or even realize- the difference. This is what makes text design such a black art. <br> <br>So choosing Garamond for a SciFi novel isn't bad because it will ruin readability (it won't), it's bad because it wastes the opportunity to <i>gently amplify</i> the content. Quality is in the details. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Quality is indeed in the details. But my conclusion is the opposite; <br>that's exactly why you shouldn't fall for the temptation and fiddle (<i>gently amplify</i>) with the ingredients, dark art or not. <br> <br>Actually, I'm not sure I intellectually grasp your theory, <br>so maybe a few visual examples would clear up the difficulties? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>The trick is to use that one typeface as sensitive and sensible as possible, not choose between hundreds and hundreds. That's skill. <br> <br>No it's not, it's playing it safe. "Sensitive and sensible" produces conservative professionalism. It requires more typographic skill to work with a new face and discover/invent the setting that is right for the job and not intrusive (i.e. "expressive"). But it's so much easier to rely on the pedigree and familiarity of old warhorses like Garamond. <br> <br>I just bought "Inferno", a surfer-dude rewrite of Dante's Inferno, set in Centaur, which really didn't match the scrappy illustrations. Like many of the classic faces, art directors use it to indiscriminately add literary gravitas -- it's "quality" packaging that makes the buyer/reader think they're getting value for money. <br> <br>Garamond, Bembo, and all the other overused fine old book faces: So many writers all speaking with the same voice -- orthodox, conventional, like a newscaster. I'm sick and tired of the monotonous drone. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Here's a cool example of subtly expressive typography..</i> <br> <br>I don't consider that 'expressive': a change in typeface is used as a navigational tool to provide information about narrative point of view. It is no more expressive than a change between roman and italic to indicate a foreign word. When someone speaks of 'expressive typography', I take this to mean typography that is somehow emotive, that draws on conventional cultural or subcultural associations to suggest a particular mood. Changing from a renaissance typeface to a romantic typeface (romantic in the art historical sense, not the emotive sense) does not seem to me particularly expressive. <br> <br>There is relatively little typography of the kind shown in the example for the simple reason that most authors use language to establish narrative point of view, not naff typographic tricks.</div>

But not this one! :-) <br> <br>It is indeed exceptional - and to me highly commendable - otherwise you must be of the position that text faces simply can't convey anything, and any new text faces are only needed to solve technical issues (or fill a huge void, like in some non-Latin scripts). <br> <br>There is another world out there beyond naive, conscious Modernism - but it's "subvisble", like in Biology or Physics: there are bacteria, quarks, etc. that decide our lives, even though you can't really see them.

<div class=commentbody><i>No. If you read the thoughts of the author (who directed the font choices) on this, you'd realize that it has nothing to with navigation, but everything to do with expression - albeit at the subsoncious level.</i> <br> <br>Therein lies the fatal flaw -- to use your favourite phrase -- in such a programme. Like abstract expressionism in painting, the intent of the author or artist to express something in his mind falls at the gateway of another's mind. The fact that the author states that the typography is expressive doesn't make it expressive. If it were genuinely expressive, it wouldn't need to be explained. This is why I prefer the term evocative to expressive, because expression implies a thought that is being expressed from one person, presumably to another, while evocation seeks only to trigger associations that the reader/viewer already has. Language remains the only halfway reliable means of expression between two or more minds.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, <br> <br><i>Actually, I said that the typographer was "playing it safe" by using well-known typefaces.</i> <br> <br>Any typographer is "playing it safe" using any good typeface, well known or otherwise. <br> <br>And I say, "good on them". <br> <br>And <br> <br><i>Otherwise why bother with a designer/typographer, why not just use a default template?</i> <br> <br>Too many reasons to enumerate.

Type designers are not the "Lady on the Pedestal" we would like ourselves to be. Typeface choice is hopefully a passing joy rather than a well remembered failure. <br> <br>Most certainly, an "unsafe typeface, well known or otherwise", is a cocktail for disaster which is why classical book faces are considered the liferafts of the wise. <br> <br>Also, need I add</div>

<div class=commentbody>Aldus didn't use classical typefaces, though. Griffo's "Adino" was something completely new in printing. But his typeface ended up being so useful, that it has now become a style. And Aldus' mark even represented progress (a steady progress.) <br> <br>The italic though of course was based on handwriting, but Griffo seemed to be more interested in how it saved space - technical progress. But typographic progress shouldn't be constrained to technical progress, and in Aldus' case, it even became cultural progress. <br> <br>However, isn't using the same "reliable" type comparable to looking at the same style of paintings over and over? Should we be content to keep seeing the same exhibit century after century? While most of us I think would agree to use as few typefaces as possible in a single book, for a whole country to use a handful of typefaces is something different and more extreme. <br> <br>At the same time, with all of my ranting for progress, I have to say this.. I have been using Sabon lately in semi-lengthy amounts of childrens' book reading, for more than one book. Mainly because of its legibility, but also because I want to stay away from ligatures and the short f's look great next to the i's without using ligatures. The more I use it, the harder I think it's going to be for me to break away from it...not because of stubborness, but because I feel like I am learning how to really use it, and I appreciate something different each time..Which might seem anti-progress, since I've been looking at the same painting for the last few books.. ha. At the same time, I'm always looking out for something that might convey my message better.. either through functionality or...By the way, are there any other types of progress that I'm missing out? Communication, cultural.. functional/technical... ? <br> <br>So perhaps, progress is just as important in the designer as it is in the typeface. (Ah.. okay. So I think, then, Fredrik, that you are saying "more so".) ? And if a designer's progress is more important to the reader than typographic progress.. the two should work more closely together than the current process of: type designer makes it in one country and designer buys it and uses it in another. I personally think the relationships need to be tighter, but designing brochures is faster than designing a typeface, so the two will probably never meet up perfectly. But it's so important for designers to have a good knowledge of type. I think I have more favorite type designers than I have graphic designers.. hmm.. <br> <br>I'm seeing both sides, but there's a side effect to not caring if a typeface sheds light onto a text. It's the whole.. not caring. Good design comes in part from having layers of meaning. The page proportions, paper selection, cover design, choice of typeface, etc. can affect the atmosphere of the book and help tell the story. Why would you want to pass up this opportunity? (Besides time and money!) <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>The italic though of course was based on handwriting, but Griffo seemed to be more interested in how it saved space - technical progress.</i> <br> <br>This is an oft repeated myth, debunked by Harry Carter and more thoroughly, by way of detailed measurements of the type, by Peter Burnhill in his fascinating new book <a href=http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/titles/type_spaces/index.html><i>Type spaces</i></a>. Burnhill notes: <br> <br><b>Morison (1926) says of Griffo's italic and its use in the composition of the octavo classics series: 'It's chief merit is that of making up extremely economically, a supreme quality in such a series as that for which Aldus employed it.' Against this, Carter (1969) writes: 'If Aldus hoped, as it is commonly said that he did, but he never said, that cursive letterforms would save space, he must have been disappointed by the results: a Roman type on the same body gets in just as much.'</b></div>

<div class=commentbody>The origins of Italic type: <br> <br>Conventional wisdom is represented by Meggs in his History: Saves space, copied from fast, informal scribe style. <br> <br>That's much too utilitarian. Here's another way of looking at it: <br> <br>Poggio invented the humanist script c.1400. It has been described by Donald M. Anderson as "plodding" and "sober". This is the writing style that Jenson's definitive Roman face interprets. <br> <br>During the Incunabula, in the later 1400s, the work of the Italian writing masters (eg Sanvito, Sinibaldi) had become more stylishly cursive, no doubt to distinguish itself from printed text. <br> <br>The era saw a swan song for the manuscript writer, before the profession morphed into a smaller number of Writing Masters (Instructors), the best of whom published how-to manuals. <br> <br>Sinibaldi designed pages that were predominantly his cursive (ie Italic), mixed with "small caps". <br> <br>It is this look which Aldus captured in type. <br> <br>So, the origin of the Italic type style is caused by the swan song virtuosity of the manuscript hand, itself a reaction to the plainness of the original Roman typefaces. <br> <br>Lots of interplay between old and new media -- exploited by artists looking for new forms, supported by a progressive marketplace. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hold on, hold on. Although I don't agree with him, I don't think this thread was started by an extremist "who thinks there is no reason to use new typefaces". <br> <br>The original objection was to the idea that it was necessary to choose each typeface to somehow "fit" the work. What I think he was saying is that so long as you choose a typeface "of worth" you can use it for anything, provided you use it carefully. He was sceptical about ideas of "congeniality" between a particular typeface and a particular text. All of this is entirely agnostic between old and new faces. He did not say that old faces are of more "worth" than new ones, or vice versa. <br> <br>(Incidentally, it is also not obvious that this will produce pairing that would be regarded as "safe". A single typeface may, for some projects, be anything but "safe" or conventional for that kind of work.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK Paul, sorry Fredrik. <br> <br>But I do get the distinct impression that you (Mr Andersson) equate good typefaces with old typefaces: <br> <br>>any typeface of worth, like Berthold's Garamond for example</div>

<div class=commentbody>Extremist, <i>moi</i>? <br> <br> >(Mr Andersson) equate good typefaces with old typefaces <br> <br>It was an <i>example</i>. <br>I could have chosen Kent Lews Whitman. <br>But, true, there aren't that many typefaces <i>of worth</i> being designed these days. <br> <br>What I do not like is the meddlesome designer trying to somehow express the spirit of our age, perhaps chosing a type designed to do the same magic, not realizing that's exactly what you're doing through all your careful choices as a designer <i>anyway</i>. <br>The differences will be noticeable in due time, perhaps subtler than if a more anxious mayfly designer had done it, and not necessarily seen through the choice of type. (But then again, maybe <i>exactly</i> because of it...) You won't catch the shoemaker desperately searching for the zeitgeist, yet his shoes will still be very much 2004. <br> <br>Although this discussion has been (or so I meant it to be) focussed on Book typography, this is my approach to many of the things I design. Just do the best you can, and beauty <i>will</i> take care of itself. <br> <br>But to use a typeface that is itself a historical fiction for historical fiction...

<div class=commentbody>>But to use a typeface that is itself a historical fiction for historical fiction... That's just poor taste. <br> <br>Whitman is an historical fiction. It is not a revival of any particular face, but done in the style of the 1920s/30s. Surely it would be entirely appropriate for a work written now, set in that era? <br> <br>Whereas a work written then would be better set in a face by Dwiggins or Gill.</div>
