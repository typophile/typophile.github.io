  is the oddest thing, and the slightly angled terminals on the h, t and l. I started
  thinking the 'a' may have been customized to disguise the font's origin. I was hoping
  the counters of the p and g would help ID it, but got nowhere so far.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  recognize this?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n- Mike\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Strategic_6648.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plymouth_6274.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Partnerships_4717.jpg]"
