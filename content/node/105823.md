body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI need typeface suggestions for this fashion label with the
  description down below. I have also attached images of the types of logos that appeal
  to them. Key words are bold, playful, upmarket and modern. I tried to play with
  black-letter but I am looking for a more contemporary feel. I like the Hook and
  Irons Co. typeface as well which has a personable almost hand drawn feel to it.
  Any help/advice would be appreciated :)\r\n\r\nName: NOBLE DEVIANCE\r\nTarget: Women
  25-35\r\n\r\nThe Logo Design is for a new and edgy fashion brand that specializes
  in Leather and High-end Faux Fur. The company is, Noble Deviance and we create accessories,
  apparel and footwear for women living in major cities like New York, Tokyo and everywhere
  in between.
