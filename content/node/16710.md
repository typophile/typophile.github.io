  raised the question as to what the best fonts would be to use in situations where
  people need very high character recognition. The situation given was in the use
  of serial numbers which have to be read from packaging and transcribed into a webpage
  for registration purposes - as a related aside the poster stated that their company
  has given up using ambiguous forms such as I, 1 and 0 in this context.\r\n\r\nFor
  some reason this question struck me as incredibly interesting, and got me wondering
  about things like vehicle registration plates and emergency signs. Does anyone have
  any pointers to good resources on the matter, opinions, or even some good practical
  suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJustin"

    for their license plates to make it impossible for people to change certain glyphs
    into other ones. Like making an 'F' into an 'E' by adding a stroke across the
    bottom. \r\n\r\nHm... need to work on those memory skills. I can't recall where
    I read that. And the article had pictures, too."

  body: Nope. None of those refer to what I'm thinking of, but thanks for trying,
    Simon! I've done a search of my own and have come up empty-handed, so perhaps
    I imagined it.

    *was* a neat Flash movie out there demonstrating how it foiled any attempts at
    glyph modification, but it appears to be gone now.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands also
    modified their character set recently:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=kenteken\r\n\r\nLineTo
    do a line of number plate fonts as well:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Headline+Fonts/Numberplate/\r\n\r\nIn
    the US, of course, different jurisdictions use different die sets. Pennsylvania,
    for example, uses numerals slightly taller than letters.  \r\n\r\nMost places
    just choose to avoid the problem altogether: combinations with 'I', 'O', and 'Q'
    are skipped, even if the dies are reasonably easy to differentiate. \r\n\r\nTexas
    just said 'the heck with it' and chucked all vowels on passenger-car plates. Florida
    used to skip 'I', 'O', and 'Q' in potentially confusing parts of their numbering
    system, but now uses them indiscriminately. This causes a raft of potential problems,
    especially because (a) especially with their die set, those glyphs are pretty
    tough to tell apart at a distance, and (b) their numbering system has devolved
    into chaos, so you don't really know for sure where the letters and numbers 'should'
    be anymore. (I'm exaggerating, but not much.)\r\n\r\nI've collected plates for
    twenty years now, so I can be [even more] exquisitely boring on the subject. Drop
    me a line and I can point you to more resources.\r\n"

    should consider getting into text font design!  :-)\r\nAssuming you haven't already...\r\n\r\nOne
    good place to look for insights into the \"recognition conflicts\" of letters
    is the research of Herman Bouma; he has created some quite interesting graphs
    that use distance lines to indicate conflicts. My own \"Modules & Similars\" diagram
    is the same sort of thing, altough it addresses immersive reading, not (just)
    letterwise recognition:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/m&s.gif\r\n\r\nThe
