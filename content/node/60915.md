body: "Hi everyone,\r\nmy name is S\xE9bastien Morlighem. I\u2019m a french teacher
  & researcher in history of typography & type design.\r\nI\u2019m also the curator
  of the Biblioth\xE8que typographique, a \u2018work-in-progress\u2019 book collection
  mainly dedicated to punchcutters & type designers for Ypsilon \xE9diteur ([[http://www.ypsilonediteur.com]],
  english website soon), who\u2019ll make its debut in February 2010 with a (french-english)
  book about Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida, co-written with Martin Majoor & introduced
  by Jan Middendorp. There\u2019ll be essays about the making of Pascal, Photina &
  ITC Mendoza Roman, as well as shorter pieces about less-known typefaces, all carefully
  documented & fully illustrated.\r\n\r\nApart of spreading the news (more about it
  In Mexico during the ATypI), I\u2019m calling the Typophile community for help about
  ITC Mendoza Roman. I\u2019m searching for any judgements/opinions/papers about this
  so uncanny face, especially around its time or release (1991). Many thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nAll
  the best\r\nS\xE9bastien"

    I have been getting his \"Christmas cards\" for decades and they are gorgeous.
    They speak to his printing ability. Beautiful linoleum cuts in multiple colors.
    He sent me a schematic of his press years ago when I did an article on him. Quite
    a delight.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Dear Michael,\r\nit\u2019s very likely that some of these cards (and other
    works such as lettering, logotypes\u2026) will be part of this book.\r\nCan you
    tell me more about this article you wrote about him? Where was it published?"

  body: "It was a journal for the Washington Calligraphers Guild. I do not recall
    the date but send me your snail mail to my e-mail    typerror at aol dot com.
    I will send you a copy. I have quite a bit of work that Jos\xE9 has sent me. Also
    you might want to touch base with Jean Larcher in Paris, I think he and Jos\xE9
    are still in touch. Jos\xE9 is such a wonderful talent and man.\r\n\r\nAll the
    best\r\nMichael"
