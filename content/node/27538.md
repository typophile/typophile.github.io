    2 things: project management, & effective google use:\r\n\r\nfifth one down when
    I googled melior:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/\r\n\r\n...
    from there you can google Herman Zapf, squared circle, Linotype, Newspaper fonts,
    & \"melior font equivalents\". Drink some coffee, whack it all together, & you
    have a report. Next time give yourself some more time so you can enjoy & learn
    from the content.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: there was a thread about melior (or supercurve-fonts, if i recall the name
    correctly, in general). for more effective search results on typophile, use the
    google-query (site:typophile.com "search term") - without the brackets of course.

  body: "I've never used Melior myself but they say it doesn't work for long texts
    (like books) but looks great in short ones. X-height is kind of large, so good
    legibility of the letterforms, but requires more leading for body text. \r\n\r\nI
    think it has kind of a friendly, slightly old-fashioned feel to it, sort of like
    Souvenir or Cheltenham, but maybe that's just me. It feels very 70s somehow. Somebody
    who was old enough to experience that decade will probably find it attractive
    and familiar.\r\n\r\nMelior is based on the \"super-elipse\" (a squared-off elipse)
    which was advocated by a Danish poet called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_%28Denmark%29\">Piet
    Hein</a> who thought it was the most beautiful of all forms and spent a lot of
    time talking about it. He thought it should be used in everything from furniture
    to city planning. Maybe the designer took a clue from him?"

  body: You might also look at people using Verona as it's very similar in spirit
    (cough*ripoff*cough). For instance, Swedish mobile phone operator <a href="http://tre.se">Tre</a>.
