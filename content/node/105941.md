body: "Hi!\r\nI am currently formatting my resume and was thinking about using Trade
  Gothic for headings and having the rest of the text in Mrs. Eaves. It looks good
  to my relatively untrained eye but I've noticed that usually it is suggested that
  Mrs. Eaves be paired with a geometrical sans serif. Is this a blasphemous combination
  or is it ok? Any suggestions and advice welcome!"

  body: There's nothing "wrong" with the combination. Of course, if you wanted to
    be more conventional, you could pair it with Mr. Eaves.

  body: I like it as a text face. And if this is a resume, there won't be a great
    deal of running text anyway.

  body: "True. And that wakes me up to an unspoken issue that's more significant here
    than high readability: does Mrs Eaves -or whatever font you're considering- say
    something relevant about you? Or rather: does it say something you'd like a prospective
    employer to hear?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
