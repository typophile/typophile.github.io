  items are being sold via an estate-style sale. There are a lot of great prints,
  including three excellent strikings of Piranesi's <em>Carceri</em> series. Oil paintings
  from the late renaissance through the early nineteenth century are also on sale,
  along with all of the antique furniture and silver. Most of what's on sale is conservative
  \u201Dhotel art,\u201D but if you like that sort of thing, this is a chance to get
  some of the original prints. "
