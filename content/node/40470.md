  has a lot of similarities but many differences, namely the 'I'.\r\n\r\nCan anybody
  help with the I.D? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nC.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TYPE_5768.jpg]"

  body: "Yes, both are very similar... however, I think Antogometrica is closest.
    Check out the arms of the 'C', Antogometrica's stops shorter like the example.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANG_6045.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DIN_5012.jpg]"

  body: Now that i look at the smaller text i think they are using din... but the
    logo is still, antagometrica. The Capital R isn't antagometrica nice spot lex!

    so similar... but hey, it grabbed my attention.\r\n\r\nThanks to both for the
