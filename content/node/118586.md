body: "I noticed that the web site for the lovely font Bonesana,\r\n\r\n[[http://www.nonpareille.net/en_GB/page/bonesana-np]]\r\n\r\nis
  seriously flawed. Although the page is too large vertically to fit in my browser,
  and my screen is reasonably large, the page only allows itself to be scrolled horizontally.
  (I was viewing it with Firefox, should that make a difference.)\r\n\r\nWhat <em>is</em>
  it with these web designers? A beautiful web page reflects well, but one that does
  not even work in the simplest ways undermines one's ability to be taken seriously.
  And, of course, this was a consequence of using the most advanced web technologies
  to give control over the appearance of the site."

    (13\_\" laptop) with Safari or Firefox. The page scroll horizontally by design
    since the content is displayed horizontally. But the better way is to tell your
    comment directly on the website contact form <a href=\"http://www.nonpareille.net/en_GB/page/contact\"\_>http://www.nonpareille.net/en_GB/page/contact</a>
    and they could answer and help you if you have a problem."

  body: "Speaking as someone who designs websites, some designers tend to ignore a
    basic tenet of good design, which is that form should follow function. In other
    words, cleverness tends to take precedence over what the website is actually meant
    to achieve.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with the concept of horizontally
    scrolling websites, but like the website in question, they tend to annoy some
    visitors, and their novelty runs the risk of being more noticeable than the content
    of the site itself."

    such as displaying panoramic pictures that are extremely wide, or some other good
    reason. '

  body: "My problem wasn't with the design choice of presenting information by horizontal
    scrolling.\r\n\r\nRather, it was with the technical issue that although there
    was some very wide information there that needed horizontal scrolling to access,
    it was also true that the page was still, <em>in addition</em>, somewhat too tall
    to allow me to see everything in my browser vertically, <strong>and yet</strong>
    no vertical scroll bar was available to remedy this, even though the browser would
    normally automatically provide one - because the technology they used to display
    the page with a horizontally-scrolling element suppressed that natural response
    of my browser.\r\n\r\nJust before the text \"Bonesana is a very sober transitional
    typeface in the style of Baskerville...\", the heading, \"Bonesana\" is cut off,
    and I cannot move upwards to see the top of it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bon_scrsh_4554.jpg]"
