body: "Rosetta is an independent foundry, created by [[David Brezina|David B\u0159ezina]],
  [[Jos\xE9 Scaglione]] and [[Veronika Burian]], with a <strong>strong focus on multi-script
  typography</strong>. It is a response to the increasing interest and need, within
  the global market, for multi-script typefaces that are both technically and aesthetically
  of the highest standard. Rosetta is committed to promoting research and knowledge
  in that area and to support excellence in world script type design. \r\n \r\nOne
  of the main objectives of the foundry is to create a retail library of high-quality
  typefaces that are respectful of the traditions and cultural background behind each
  of the supported scripts. Rosetta actively promotes team-work and collaboration
  between designers, consultants and language specialists. To date we support pan-European
  Latin, Arabic, Greek and Cyrillic for Slavic languages as well as for many Asian
  languages. The addition of type families for Indian scripts is planned for early
  2011. \r\n \r\nRosetta also caters tailored type design and font customization services
  for corporate use and OEM. Please contact us if you wish to discuss your particular
  project.\r\n\r\n<strong>Official web:</strong> [[http://rosettatype.com]]"
