  body: "I attempted to track down a font which used a cascading multiline effect
    like _TOSCANO_ but after looking at many candidates, I did not find anything closer
    than Dazzle, already suggested by Kevin.\r\nIt would help if you could provide
    some information on the source of your image. Is it a sign on a building in Brazil?
    A logo for a product? Something on a website. Any idea as to when it was made?
    Do you have any more letters?\r\nDon"

  body: Even if we did find a somewhat similar font, I doubt it would have a boxy
    'S' like that.

  body: Mike -- Good S's are hard to design. It's a lot easier to build using straight
    strokes. This way you can always use it as a 5 too.

  body: "<em>Good S's are hard to design.</em>\r\n\r\nIndeed. Many consider it the
    hardest letter to get right. Perhaps Mr. Gast simply gave up trying. Still, an
    S like that in Kevin's Zebron would have been a huge improvement - and lent itself
    nicely to the vertical lines. Just sayin' ..."

  body: "Good find Dick and Fivos. \r\nI was really wondering what the rest of the
    letters would look like. Some of the Echo Deco letters are good, like _B_, _D_,
    _E_. _F_, _H_, _J_, _L_, _T_, _U_ and _V_ , but others are a real disappointment
    compared to _TOSCANO_. I was hoping for some more letters with sloped echos like
    _A_ -- the technique used in Zebron. \r\nMike, I agree about S being the hardest
    letter to get right. I recently tried to do a heavy extruded _S_ for the _FIREWORKS_
    ID and the only way I could duplicate it was to chuck the rule book and make an
    _S_ that dropped to a level well below the _O_ or _C_. BTW  the _S_ in Echo Deco
    works for me. But reversing it makes a _2_ not the _Z_ shown in Echo Deco.\r\nDon"
