    see this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>All topics are welcome\u2014<strong>except font ID
    requests.<strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\nFortunately for people wanting fonts identified,
    there is a completely seperate forum, frequented by people who delight in answering
    such questions\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/typeid \r\n\r\nFor me, I can only help
    by telling you it isn't Times, Helvetica, or Comic Sans."
