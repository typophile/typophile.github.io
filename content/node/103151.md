  I suppose most of you did -- was it was also the name of William's lead ship when
  he invaded England.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With a Dutch army,
  William landed at Brixham in southwest England on 5 November 1688. He came ashore
  from the ship Brill, proclaiming \"the liberties of England and the Protestant religion
  I will maintain\".</blockquote>\r\n"

  body: No connection. The publishing company is named after its 19th Century owner,
    Evert Jan Brill. The firm was previously owned by the Luchtmans family, and under
    that name dates back to the 17th Century.

    or perhaps the battle fought there.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brielle\r\n\r\nStill,
    a curious coincidence."
