  body: Could it be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-caledonia/">New
    Caledonia</a>? Or rather <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonia_(typeface)">the
    original Caledonia</a> by William Addison Dwiggins from 1938?

  body: 'Thank you! That''s it. The capital G is the same. I think it''s the original
    Caledonia, based on the greater angle on the ascenders (b, h notably). It''s from
    a 1986 reprint of a 1972 book by Harper and Row. '
