  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi Hrant, Raph, William and the other experts!</p>
<p>I have a question. Hope its a good one and someone may offer a good solution.
I am actually working on a font of mine that was orignally created with FontStudio
and therefore and for it was intended to be so it is very thin and somehow fragile. As I said
it is wanted to be so. But lately I feel the need to prepare it for using it in textsizes and I like
to know wether there is a really good automatic way to give it more weight better than making
it simply bolder because I always felt that this makes the letters somehow clumsy, they loose
their original subtility that comes from the slight pen details, contrasts of lines etc.
Is their a way to make it automatically bolder yet keeping the atmosphere of the pen stroke
in it? Some good values or so (your experiences) for a filter or other ticks?
What is with Multiple Master? I am ashamed to really not knowing very much about it. Can it help in
a case like that? Bezier curves in my font are quite rational i.e. maximum point are horizontal,
vertical etc.</p>
<p>Can anybody give me good advice?</p>
<p>Thanks guys
Stefan</p>
<p>this is the baby

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When you describe the letters as »clumsy« you are judging it in zoomed view on screen, don&rsquo;t you?
You should only judge them when printed in a small sizes. You will notice that it usually helps to have a bolder stroke and less contrast. So making the text sizes bolder is a good start. You may try differnt settings for X and Y and you will need make adjustments, because you will loose some details like ink traps.</p>

<p>Of course you are right with the principles, yet I know that there are some guys here that have made lots of experiences with using different values in the offered tools for example in FontLab. You can use a lot of tricks I believe. Maybe someone can give me some instructions how to do it in the best possible way. I loved the idea to make no further adjustments. So I would be able to work on with the thin version and make them when I want into textsize. Like a reference model. But maybe I am asking the impossible. Usually one has to do so much adjustments that it is like designing it all over again..</p>
<p>Thank you nevertheless
Stefan</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m actually trying to do just about the exact opposite thing, Stefan: taking my very heavy bold sans font [[http://typophile.com/node/34899|Gohan]] to lighten it into a text weight. I&rsquo;m also updating the base design, but even the original, in spite of its flaws and chunkiness, holds up quite well printed at small sizes already.</p>
<p>But enough about me.~ What were those pricniples I was told about text fonts? Large x-height, short descenders, reduced contrast (all relative to a display font of the same weight). I&rsquo;m probably mangling my vocabulary. Anyway, I wonder what Hrant will say come August!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stefan,</p>
<p>Simply: Print several samples of text at several small sizes, such as 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 point. Then, look at them. Go for a bike ride, play soccer, sleep, wake up and return to the samples, and again, look at them. See them not as the designer but as a disinterested reader. Can you read them? Compare those samples with a variety of books and magazines. What is easiest to read, what is difficult? Once you have seen the effect of your type at small sizes, you will know what to do.</p>
<p>General rules: light typefaces, and typefaces set at very small point sizes are not comfortable to read. The smaller you set the type, the stronger the forms should be.</p>
<p>If you want to use automatic tools, FontLab lets you add different amounts of weight to verticals and horizontals at the same time. For example, you can add 50 units to the main stems and only 20 units to the horizontals. This does not give finished results, but it can be useful.</p>

<p>I should remind you of this thread in August you said ;-)
Actually I am quite unexperienced when it comes to internet forums. So this is the only way I know. By the way how can one find fast the discussions in which he is envolved instead of stepping through the pages and searching.. are there easier ways? What does this „my blog“ mean and for what it is intended?</p>
<p>Stefan
Hope you had nice holidays
Mines where way to fine so coming back is double hard. Don’t know how I will stand my work as graphic designer in publicity agencies. I am tired. :-(</p>
