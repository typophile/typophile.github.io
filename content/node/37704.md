  design student and I'm starting my thesis work on typeface design. My intention
  is to design a typeface specially for setting finnish language texts. My only problem
  thus far is, that I'm not sure what I should take in consideration when designing
  the typeface specifically for a single language. I know about fixing kerning and
  such, but I have no idea what else there is. If there even is anything more.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I'm hoping someone here could point me to some direction, on where to find some
  information on this. Books, essays or webresources that I can actually quote on
  my thesis would be wonderful, but any kind of comments on the matter are appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nKai Talonpoika "

  body: "One thing to consider, is whether the language contains unusual lettercombinations
    that can cause problems. In norwegian, for instance, the combination <em>gj</em>
    is quite common (<em>Gjengen gjekk gjenom gjerdet</em>), and in many otherwise
    great typefaces this combination causes the letters to collide in a terribly unaesthetic
    way. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to check, is the frequency of different types of letters.
    If a language contains a lot of uppercase letters, like german, it is often wise
    to make the uppercase letters look less dominant. The same goes for letters with
    ascenders, descenders or umlauts."

    on this subject? Book that Alessandro mentioned seems interesting, but based on
    Amazon's blurb on it, it might be bit off topic. I'll be checking it out though.\r\n\r\nArild
    mentioned checking letter frequencies, and I'll be doing. Friend of my did a small
    programme for me, that I can feed text in to and it counts frequencies of letters,
    letter pairings and letter triplets too. That ought to prove sufficient, I hope.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "I don't think language is the primary factor to consider, but code pages.\r\nIf
    your typeface supports a particular code page, then ALL the glyphs you create
    for its characters should fit nicely with one another--because it's not just frequent
    combinations you want to look good, but every combination, and just about every
    combination will show up in text eventually, somewhere or other, and your typeface
    should be prepared to deal with them all.\r\n\r\nFrequency combination charts
    are useful in reducing the number of kern pairs for non-class-kerned fonts, but
    well-designed fonts don't have a lot of kern pairs anyway.\r\nKai, this business
    of letter frequencies is a red herring (a falsity, an irrelevance, a distraction).\r\n\r\nWhen
    languages non-native to the designer have special characters, such as, for me,
    the Slovak \"lcaron\" and \"dcaron\", then it helps to see how the character works
    in setting. That's an interesting example--because for a long time Slovaks have
    been making do with foreign fonts that treat the accent more like an apostrophe,
    inserting a gap into the accented word. Now Peter Bi\u013Eak (Typotheque) is saying,
    \"Wait a minute, a gap in a word, caused by a mere accent, is silly,\" and designing
    types which minimize the width of that accent.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong,
    but I don't think there is any special concern for Finnish, typographically speaking,
    other than frequent diereses. So you should pay special attention to getting the
    dieresis right; in particular the distance between the dots, their size and vertical
    position relative to the dot on \"i\", and, as Chris says, how it may kern, with
    T,V,W,Y and f. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, there are letter combinations that occur
    in Finnish that are unlikely in English, such as aa. If you look to older typefaces
    from English-language designers as your model, it may well be that the aa combination
    is not anticipated in their design. \r\nBut I think such errors are less likely
    in newer typefaces, as type designers are better informed on such matter now.\r\nAnyway,
    if you are proceding from scratch--which is the best way to go-- rather than \"reviving\"
    or modifying other designs, you won't have to worry about that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nFor
    a \"pan-latin\" perspective, these are excellent resources:\r\n\r\nwww.diacritics.typo.cz\r\nwww.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/lowercase.aspx\r\nwww.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/diacritics.aspx"
