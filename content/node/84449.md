  but since the messages I posted with my previous account are gone, I'm posting this
  again.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the fonts in this image. Especially the font of \"OPERATOR'S
  LICENSE\" and the type-writer-like font (in wich the numbers and \"CHESTER COPPERPOT\"
  are written).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/copperpotlicense.jpg\">\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your advice."

    license, but uses some (distorted!) typefaces that are more recent.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    my suggestions: \r\nStone Sans (stretched), FFTrixie (typewriter), TradeGothic
    BoldExtended."

  body: "Hey Bert, thanks for your post. You are correct on the image: it is not a
    real 1930 license. This image has been made recently, to represent the license
    seen in the movie \"The Goonies\". In that movie the license is seen, but not
    very clearly. This replica I found comes very, very close to the original (about
    90% correct I'd say). Since a screencap of the movie would not be very sharp,
    and probably the fonts used there are not all really digital fonts, I preferred
    to use the image I posted: I'm sure the fonts on there exist, and the image is
    much sharper than a screenshot.\r\n\r\nBut for completeness: this is the screenshot
    of the actual license. If someone could identify the fonts on there, that would
    be even more great...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/3993/screenmho.jpg\">"

    see, the replica (first image in this thread) comes very close to the original.
    So I'd really like to identify the fonts used there...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i51.tinypic.com/if644g.jpg\">"
