  font, even got that book, \"learn fontlab fast\", but I just feel the interface
  is kind complicated I don't know, I think I will eventually get used to it, but
  since I intend to just do display fonts I don't think all that stuff, so I would
  like to know if there's a more easy to use software to make professional display
  fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Fontlab is pretty easy to learn compared to some packages out there. You might
    want to try Font Creator Program, as it's pretty simple too, but, as with anything,
    there's bound to be a significant learning curve! I think Corel Draw can still
    output to TTF, so if that's all you need...

    tried any of them? Could be something like <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/">ScanFont</a>
    is all you're looking for.

    I use it on OS 8.1 and OS 9.22. Fontographer version 4.x (the last update before
    Pyrus/Fontlab bought it) was easy to use too. FontMonger is kinda hard to do node
    editing, at least for me. For free you can try Fontmaster (dtl.nl) is free, kinda
    clumsy, but if you are using less than 257 characters, it is, free and has a unique
    setup. Fontmaster Manuals were kinda tough to get through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe

    other programs are easier to use than FontLab, but the overwhelming majority of
    professional font developers use it because it has a lot more of the features
    we want/need than anything else out there. (I never did see the compiled results
    of the Typophile survey on this subject, which would have been interesting. But
    the trend of the raw data was pretty clear.)\r\n\r\nBut if you just want easier
    to use, try TypeTool or Fontographer. TypeTool is probably the better choice because
    it is essentially \"FontLab Lite\" and what you learn using TypeTool will largely
    be applicable if you move on to FontLab later.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    to learn, it's just the amount of features I tought kind overwhelming and needless
    for me, at least now, since I'm into designing display, poster fonts not the next
    Garamond. So I guess I'll take a look at TypeTool and Fontographer since I'm on
    PC.\r\n\r\nThe only question I have is will I be able to make professional, I
    mean sellable fonts with these softwares?"

    pretty much no legal way to get a copy. So what's the use of recommending it?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    OP said they wanted to make \"professional\" display fonts. To me, that implies
    certain capabilities that are lacking in many applications, including FontStudio.\r\n\r\nI
    should say that I am assuming the original poster only wants to have one application.
    A moderate number of folks use some other application for initial letter drawing
    and then move the results over to FontLab for final font output.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    products. [\u2026]\u2019\r\n\r\nThomas has also supported DTL FontMaster over
    the time, for instance by giving a presentation at the FM Track during the ATypI
    Conference in Brighton September last year. Nevertheless I can\u2019t fully agree
    with all his conclusions concerning font production software in general.\r\n\r\n>\u2018[\u2026]it
    has a lot more of the features we want/need than anything else out there [\u2026]\u2019\r\n\r\nI
    seriously doubt this. Perhaps in case of DTL FontMaster this idea is caused by
    the fact that a lot of the functionality in FM is well hidden and/or not described
    in the manual yet (we will work on this).\r\nIn my opinion there is a clear distinction
    between functionality for the design process and for the actual font production
    and there is quite some unique functionality in FM in both these areas and probably
    more than in anything else out there, if only for the support for manual digitizing.
    \ \r\n\r\n>\u2018[\u2026] the overwhelming majority of professional font developers
    use it [\u2026]\u2019\r\n\r\nA highly professional minority use our tools at the
    other hand.\r\n\r\nEase of use is in my opinion relative anyway. Maybe the learning
    curve of FM is somewhat steeper than that of some other font tools, but for instance
    the fact that the OT layout features can be automatically generated using a centralized
    features file, makes this process quite easy to control at the end.\r\n\r\nReproducibility
    is a prerequisite for professional font production and FM is structured for this
    more than anything else out there, I think. Actually I am curious of what the
    audience of the FM Track in Brighton thought of the direct comparison by Miguel
    and myself of the font production tools used at respectively Adobe and DTL.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, within a couple of weeks we will release a new version of FM, that includes
    a number of new functions, besides the inclusion of the OT SDK 2.0 version.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hello Mr Lozos, even though it is very technical and more or less describes
    functions one by one, the best sources are the manuals at http://www.fonttools.org
    in the second pulldown menu from top in the left column. (I wonder, wasn't there
    an all-in-one PDF?) Also http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl -- click "FontMaster"
    in the navigation, then there is a pulldown menu with some PDFs. Maybe these are
    more helpful to get the idea than the detailed manual?

  body: Frank, are there any plans to release FM for OS X? Currently, I see there
    is a beta of CompareMaster, but the rest of the tools apparently require Classic
    on OS X, which means they can't run on any of the current crop of Macs, which
    all run on Intel processors.

    prominently into play when it's a multi-user environment and/or the users are
    more technically inclined than the average type designer. As a consequence, the
    people I'd be recommending considering FM to have already made their font tool
    choices or are making those choices on their own.\r\n\r\nI'm curious as to what
    other Typophiles think of the learning curve and ease of use of FontMaster vs
    FontLab glyph editing tools.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that we haven't mentioned is

    market software. With the amount of work it takes to design type, there are fewer
    folks among the masses that are willing to take up the task as a hobby. Iwonder
    what Adobe's reasoning was with the old Letraset FontStudio? There must have been
    a business reason for letting it wane and die?\r\nOnce the market is saturated,
    where can growth come from? The danger with underpricing to a small market is
    that raising prices later is greeted with negative feelings from the customer
    base who have grown accustomed to the lower pricepoint. From the developers point
    of view, you have to be able to afford the resources to continue development and
    support. From the customer's perspective, who wants an underpriced application
    that won't be supported or improved?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "> \u2018[\u2026] the best sources are the manuals [\u2026]\u2019\r\n\r\nBasically
    they are, but at the other hand some thorough updating has become necessary because
    not all functionality in FM is actually (fully) covered in the manual. Functionality
    as for instance the T-disconnector in the editors (see illustration below) and
    the generation of command files by DataMaster and the subsequent editing and use
    of these, are not described in the current edition.\r\n\r\nThe new version of
    the manual will also provide more detailed information on technical stuff, like
    the modification of Adobe\u2019s Hatch OpenType Tool (HOT) at URW++ under the
    supervision of Dr. Juergen Willrodt, which makes the automatic generation of the
    OpenType layout features possible.\r\n\r\n> \u2018[\u2026] are there any plans
    to release FM for OS X [\u2026]\u2019\r\n\r\nThis is a somewhat complicated issue.
    Although an OS X version of the BE and IK editors would be nice as such (for instance
    the programmers would love to develop this) and the availability probably would
    enlarge the interest from the Mac community, from a font production point of view
    there is not a real necessity. The Windows version is fast and, more important,
    stable and reliable. With the Intel based Macs, running the Windows version of
    FM under BootCamp, Parallels or VMWare Fusion is from a technical point of view
    no problem. Especially the Coherence Mode in Parallels works very nice in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWe
    calculated the man-years needed for the development of OS X versions of the editors
    and quite a substantial investment would be required. Because FM is targeted at
    the niche part of a market that is already niche of itself, it is not very realistic
    to expect a return on investment or even a profit.\r\n\r\nAn important factor
    is also that we simply don\u2019t have the capacity to supply extensive support
    for FM at a very basic level. Also for that reason we are targeting at the high
    end of the market with the full package and are we releasing the Light, unsupported,
    version for free.\r\nMaking an investment for an OS X version purely to conquer
    more market share, would also mean that we would have to change our way of working
    completely. At the moment we are just only making our proprietary software available
    for the market and we simply like it that way (which does not imply that FM is
    not or will not be continuously under development).\r\n\r\nSo, for the moment
    it makes more sense for us to focus on the enhancement of the functionality of
    the editors, especially the automation part, and to use our resources mainly for
    that. But maybe we will change our opinion in the future, one never knows. \r\n\r\nAll
    new FM modules, like CompareMaster (a lot more functionality will be added the
    coming time), will have an OS X and Windows version and also some of the batch
    modules, like DataMaster (because this is necessary for generating Mac PS Type1
    and TrueType), will become available for OS X.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T-disconnector_5742.gif]"
