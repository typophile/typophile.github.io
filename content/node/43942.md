  Some of the littlest things are big to Jeff Deck, who is traveling the country in
  search of mistakes. \u2018I have always been aware of typos wherever I go,\u2019
  he said dryly. \u2018I figured that it was a national problem.\u2019  So far he
  has put 5,000 miles on his 1997 Nissan Sentra.  Friends come along for a few weeks
  at a time.  It's all documented on his website for The Typo Eradication Assistance
  League (Teal) :\r\nhttp://www.jeffdeck.com/teal/blog/ \u201D"

    heard about the Typo Eradication Assistance League a couple of weeks ago on NPR.
    \ I wanted to go along for the ride.\r\n\r\nI can't help but spot typos in anything
    and everything I read.  It's enough to make me stop reading a book, when I find
    too many typos.  \r\n\r\nBut it's hilarious when businesses get their own phone
    numbers and email addresses wrong.  When looking around for editing work, I've
    gotten return emails declining my services, even though their text is chock full
    o' typos.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm new to this site.  Your forum gave me a great
    answer when I was looking for the right way to abbreviate \"circa.\"  I couldn't
    find the answer in my paper <em>Chicago</em> style manual, but your member oldnick
    could.  Thanks and hello.\r\n\r\nRoberta\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>I know a lot about art,
