Throughout the campus, every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn&rsquo;t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can&rsquo;t capture, and I found it fascinating.&rdquo; Steve Jobs 2005</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can have an account of the development of typography in personal computers that doesn&rsquo;t include Adobe. I suspect John Warnock&rsquo;s hiring of Sumner Stone as Director of Typography in 1984 had a much greater impact on the direction of digital typography than a calligraphy class that Steve Jobs took once.</p>

<p>Just my opinion, but I think one&rsquo;d never know without you, Paul Shaw 
<a href="http://t.co/qSL5qBEq">(re: Arial</a>) or someone else baiting just the right person ;)</p>
<p>John&gt; &ldquo;I suspect John Warnock&rsquo;s hiring of Sumner Stone [&hellip;] in 1984 had a much greater impact on the direction of digital typography than a calligraphy class that Steve Jobs took once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;ve done my own homework on that one;) IMHO Warnock brought the digital outline together with another Reed College calligrapher-turned-Autologic-type director Stone, and got a lot of great clones, revivals and interpretations of the standard fair. After the dream of an Adobe-dominated PS/Type1 font market dies, Warnock pretty much disappears until a font is named after him. Stone was pretty important to Adobe though, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Jobs made of the standard fare, and then added a whole bunch of non-standard fare, the daring though sometimes hideous scripts and decorative faces of the &ldquo;city fonts&rdquo;, all as optimized bitmaps, perfect for the screen he was targeting. Then, when he needed to, he got proper licenses to the closest designs, as outline fonts, keeping consistent designs and names across the technical and cultural gap between the first generation of pcs and printers, from Apple, Xerox, IBM and HP, (all too puny to deal with outline fonts + 300 dpi output), and the second generation, 1986 Mac, that was just barely able to use postscript fonts and talk to high res. output.</p>
<p>And then, Jobs took the classy-font-thing to Apple&rsquo;s web presence, and then to mobile devices. All because of one class. ;)</p>

And I don’t think that you can have an account on this development without mentioning URW, especially Dr. Peter Karow. At the DTL FontMaster conference of 2009 in The Hague, Peter Rosenfeld’s presentation titled <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/TD_2009/Re-Inventing_Technology_09.pdf">Re-inventing Technology</a> was about the early days of digital typography. On page 30 of the PDF you will see a photograph from the 1980’s, which shows quite some very important people from the font business, including some visitors from Adobe who came to learn the trade in Hamburg.
 
Question of the day for this forum: can you name the VIP’s on the photo?

David: ‘<em>Cleo Huggins is my pick</em>’
 
<strong>Bingo!</strong> The following piece of text is from Peter Rosenfeld’s (on the photo in question: front row, #4 from the left) presentation:
 
<em>This photo was taken in 1985 or 1986. Prof. Hermann Zapf, living design Germany legend from Darmstadt near Frankfurt, the man in the blue suit in the center of the picture, designed a range of new typefaces for URW in those years. […] The two young people on the right-hand side, Cleo Huggins and Dan Mills, are from California, and were sent to URW to learn all about IKARUS and professional font production. At that time, Cleo and Dan worked for Bigelow &amp; Homes of Sans Francisco, later both were hired by … Adobe. Adobe’s early type director, well known designer Sumner Stone, worked for Autologic, a former IKARUS customer in the LA neighbourhood. […]
 
The guy next to Cleo, right behind Peter Karow, is Mark Jamra, another US designer who spent a few years at URW designing and producing his ﬁrst major font family Jamille. Jamille was released by ITC, the former independent font design marketing company from New York, today owned by Monotype sharing the same destiny as Letraset and Linotype – and who is next? By the way, URW was commissioned to digitize and distribute ITC’s new typeface releases for about 10 years.</em>

<p>Well, at this point, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what we&rsquo;re talking about, but let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s the consumer devices Apple is known for.</p>
<p>I agree that it can be seen as sad that we&rsquo;ve invented computers that allow us to send robots to Mars, yet for the most part, they&rsquo;re used for porn and facebook.</p>
<p>And the iPad, as an example, is certainly a device focused mainly on our modern mindless entertainment. Jobs changed the world of music, gaming, reading, etc. He certainly didn&rsquo;t invent world peace or anything of the sort.</p>
<p>That said, what he did build is being used for some rather remarkable things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily great mass market ads. A specific example is children who don&rsquo;t have the ability to speak. Many of these children have had to rely on sound boards&hellip;large boards with pictures on them that they have to touch to have a computerized voice speak for them. The problems with these devices were their size, limited vocabulary, and incredible expense.</p>
<p>Then came the iPad. That with a $100 app and this child now has the ability to communicate more than they ever could before. And there&rsquo;s even a good side to the &ldquo;fashionware sh*t&rdquo;&hellip;this child is no longer that weird kid with the wheelchair. He&rsquo;s now that kid with the iPad.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s all about perspective. What people do with the technologies is good and bad. Useful and pointless. But the technology is there now and accessible in ways that we may not have even imagined if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>And here, I always thought that a computer was simply an automated adding machine. Not something that can actually think in the sense of being conscious.</p>
<p>That is not to say, of course, that computers are not wonderful inventions. They are so versatile that, in fact, they could indeed be used to create a conscious &ldquo;artificial brain&rdquo; - sometime in the future. Not necessarily the very <em>far</em> future, either, with the rapid progress of microelectronics.</p>

of replicating actual intelligence, philosophically. But if
one defines AI as the ability of a machine to simply <em>appear</em>
intelligent -which does have fundamental social implications-
then at least according to the Turing Test we&rsquo;re already there:
Elbot and Cleverbot -as primitive as they are compared to what
will be- can fool about 1/3 of people long enough to matter.
Now one might point to something like Siri, but the problem
is nothing controlled by a corporation can ever hope to be
allowed to make real social change for the better.</p>

it did have before the average Joe realized there&rsquo;s money in it.</p>
