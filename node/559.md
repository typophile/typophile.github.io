  <BR>First of all: what a great initiative! Your comments and work is a great inspiration
  to me.  <BR>This here is my first font. I mainly made it to to get experienced with
  the software, thus the utter simplicity of it.. it&#39;s been lurking around my
  hard drive for quite some time now, so I think it&#39;s about time I finish it <IMG
  SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR>Any comments
  as to what I should do better? <BR> <BR>Thank you, <BR>Mads Rahbek Hougaard'

    the typeface a bit. Softening it up a bit...  <BR> <BR>I hear you. It definetly
    needs &#34;humanizing&#34;! <BR>Still, doing that would probably make it necessary
    to change a whole lot &#40;if not everything&#41;, which I&#39;m not really up
    to... <BR>The &#34;dead&#34; nature of this font might be because I was very &#40;perhaps
    too&#41; systematic about it. Building the letters out of small bricks. Next time
    I&#39;ll try a different approach. <BR> <BR>&#62;The K&#39;s does seem a bit odd

    ALT="anton_kk.gif">  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a pic of the old k&#39;s - but I don&#39;t
    really like them. I think this K resembles the X too much. Also, I was thinking
    the new k&#39;s would probably be more readable in context with the other letters,
    because they are more unique? But perhaps they&#39;re too unique? <BR> <BR>&#62;I
    think that q could, out of context be mistaken for a g...  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve heard
    that before, so it&#39;s probably true. But I must admit I&#39;m quite fond of
    it as it is, so I think I&#39;ll take my chances <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR>Good point. I will try that. <BR> <BR>&#62;Also I think the &#39;g&#39; is
    too closed. Maybe open up the lower counter.  <BR> <BR>I was hoping nobody would
    notice that! I have earlier tried to do something about it, but I thought the
    results didn&#39;t work out that well. I just made two new versions though, which
    aren&#39;t just as bad. Or, one of them isn&#39;t. I think. Here they are: <BR>

    <BR>I sort of like the black one. But maybe the space in the middle &#40;excuse
    my complete lack of english typographic words!&#41; is still too small? <BR> <BR>Thank
    you all &#40;including you Hrant&#41; for the nice words - it went smoother than

    are the softer elements since the overall structure has a very technical feel
