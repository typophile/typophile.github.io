  body: I would vote for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atdavison-zip-bold/atdavison-zip-bold/testdrive.html?s=FULL+HOUSE&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Davison Zip Bold</a>. It&#39;s by a well-known lettering artist
    from the right era, who has lots of film type faces to his credit. This one was
    digitized by Agfa. <BR> <BR>There are a number of other good brush lettering fonts,
    if you look for them, as well as those already mentioned.
