<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I know some of them used the 'spacers' to built up letters and other square forms to print. With 'spacers' I mean the blocks normally used to tighten a printing forme on the press. Look at the work of De Stijl for example.
I'm not sure how those are called in English, since it's not my native tongue. :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>When you say 'Constructivists' do you mean the Russians or do you mean the folks who were influenced by them like Bauhaus & De Stijl etc.

Maybe also helpful:
http://typophile.com/node/18503
Also, have you looked at the precusrsor to Constructivist stuff : Futurism? Futurism had an Italian as well as a Russian branch. They are clearly related in some key ways.

I am specifically asking about the Russian Constructivists.
<cite>AFAIK, fonts were not produced during the era of heroic communism (too bourgeois).</cite>
That’s what I figured. Aside from the work of the Stenbergs I have not found any consistency in the lettering, so the lack of any manufactured fonts explains it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>AFAIK, fonts were not produced during the era of heroic communism (too bourgeois).
In the famous Constructivist posters, book covers and magazines, they used exisiting fonts for small scale typography, and lettered the larger stuff themselves -- as was common practice elsewhere during the teens, 20s and 30s. Remember, that photolettering (typositor) had not been introduced even in the West then, and the best "pre-made" type for headlines was wood, and a bit rough anyway. So if you wanted nice big lettering, you made original artwork, and that was true whether you were working in the capitalist West and wanted some neo-Renaissance thang, or were a Soviet radical.</div>

<div class=commentbody> As far as I know El Lissitzky was famous for graphic design and "typography" but maybe this included only collage on posters, drawing, lettering on the image, book design etc.
Maybe you should check within Vkhutemas, the school.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In 1923 El Lissitzky designed <em>For the voice</em>, a collection of Majakovskij's poems, just with type and spacing materials available in the small print shop where it was produced. <a href="http://www.zam.it/3.php?libro=9999999999&id_autore=53">Here</a> you can see a picture (unfortunately small) of the fac-simile edition issued in 2003 by the italian publishing house <em>Ignazio Maria Gallino Editore</em>.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I once noticed some variations in the lettering (and I do believe it is lettering, not type) produced by [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and was surprised to notice how much variation was there. In the same line of text the width of a given character varied by as much as 20 percent (based on my non-scientific assessment).
My own conclusion: type was a rich part of the posters, but a secondary detail, kind of like movie stars' teeth in the 1970s. =)
I've since thought that making a Rodchenko font that is true to his hand would be tough to pull off. How do you, with today's reproduction fidelity, stay true to his variation and warmth of his lettering. I think it would look too mechanical or canned.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I realize the irony of that last statment... How can you go wrong making a Constructivist layout (or typeface) too mechanical... that was part of the point.

<div class=commentbody>Joe, nevertheless, your comment raises the question of what Rodchenko's lettering/type would look like if he had today's tools at his disposal. (I know, I know -- it might be pointless to speculate on "what if..." questions.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's about synthesizing the ideological and the practical.
The ideology being scientific communism based on the theory of dialectical materialism.
A three-part theory is outlined: Tectonics, Faktura, and Construction.

Also in the book are essays by Lissitsky and Moholy-Nagy.</div>
