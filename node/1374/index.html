Over the past few years he has designed and printed a collection of typographical broadsheets, so rich in concept as to be almost paintings rather than merely a collection of wood-and-metal-type posters. <BR> <BR>If you contact him, you may be able to get him to send you a photocopy or some other representation of his work.  <BR> <BR>He can be contacted by e mail at: <BR> <BR><a href="mailto:flywheel@premier1.net"><a href="mailto:flywheel@premier1.net">flywheel@premier1.net</a></a> <BR> <BR>You can blame the intrusion on me. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thank guy's  <BR>Appritiate all the help. <BR>I will check out all the info's you recomended, not so easy to get hold of some of the staff though. But i wont give up. <BR>While i was researching Carson's work i got the impression that typography has healling powers.  <BR>After reading a few books on art theraphy i believe that art and drawing can heal.  <BR>Do you think it would work the same way with type? Can typograhy be used as a theraphy? <BR>M   <BR></div>
