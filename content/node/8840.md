body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for the name of the font that looks more or less
  like &#34;money.&#34; To be a bit more descriptive, it looks similar to the words
  &#34;in God we trust&#34; on the back of the one dollar bill, but it is still slightly
  different....instead of having diagonal lines running through the text, the font
  I&#39;m looking for &#40;and have seen, somewhere&#41; has engraved horizontal lines
  running through the letters, to create a very fine, very detailed look.... <BR>
  <BR>Any ideas would be much appreciated! <BR> <BR>Dave

  body: It&#39;s very close to the text that reads &#34;money&#34; in your link....
    <BR> <BR>But instead of shaded cross-hatched lines, it has simple horizontal hatch
    lines &#40;without drop shadows, shading effects, diagonal hatch lines, etc&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I think I saw the font as featured in a Claudia Calhoun wedding invitation
    book.... it&#39;s a relatively common font that can be easily engraved by a typesetter...Federal
    seems a bit too obscure... <BR> <BR>Any more ideas?
