body: I have an old catalog from 1995 that features some fonts available from &#34;bright
  ideas&#34;.  <BR> <BR>This was a subscription service where a disc was sent once
  a month containing various software clip art and fonts. The number provided is no
  longer in service. Anyone know if this company was bought out?  <BR> <BR>Some fonts
  in this catalog are &#34;tamarin&#34;, &#34;patton&#34;, &#34;pinhead&#34;, &#34;sapporo&#34;.
  Ring a bell?
