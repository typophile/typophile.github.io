body: Whenever I start a new InDesign file it always opens with Minion as the default
  font. I can't stand it! (I don't mean I can't stand Minion, although it's true it
  doesn't work for my purposes.) I mean I can't stand that I cannot choose my own
  default font preference (which happens to be Centaur) for whenever I open a new
  InDesign file. Or can I? And I just cannot find out how to? Thanks for any pointers.
