  body: 'I disagree. Friz Quadrata is very different in certain ways: look at the
    g and e in the lower-case, and look at the overall contrast between thicks and
    thins -- Friz has a much lower contrast than this face, which, I believe, is much
    closer to the Carmina I identified earlier.'

  body: 'I think Chesh is right. Probably a knock-off of Carmina. The character shapes
    are there, but the spacing is horrible. You often see that with knock-offs. And,
    it&#39;s definitely not Friz. <BR> <BR>Also: Note to Mark Taylor: Carmina is not
    &#34;the Mac equivalent&#34; of your Fritz font. Carmina is the original and is
    available for both Windows and Mac. Fritz is just a bad copy. There may or may
    not be a Mac version of it. You would be better off with Carmina unless you absolutely
    must have that bad spacing.'
