  The editor wants me to try a sans-serif font. Some of the readers are vision impaired
  so the size of the text needs to be 10.5pt, 10 at least.\r\n\r\nI use Helvetica
  Neue for \"pull quotes\" but I think this might be a bit too wide and inefficient
  on space for body text. The text should work well with the 'pull quotes\"\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help?\r\n\r\nAndeee"

    of weights, including some condensed ones. Is it okay, with your readers in mind,
    to use a condensed weight for the pull quotes?\r\n\r\nAlso, you will get more
    responses by posting a question like this in the Design forum rather than on your
    blog..."
