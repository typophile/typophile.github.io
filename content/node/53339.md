body: "Hi,\r\nI have generated my first Opentype(.otf) font and I am currently testing/tweaking
  the font on various Apps.\r\n\r\nMy Font runs like a dream on Word 2007, but strangely
  enough the Font won't appear in 'Preview' mode in Illustrator. In 'Outline' mode
  it is there in black as if it's in 'Preview' mode, but in 'Preview' mode it appears
  white(invisible). And I can't recolor the font in 'Preview' mode. The Font appears
  as WYSIWYG in the Font List Menus.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Glyph Palette shows the individual
  Glyphs as being invisible. (I couldn't even be bothered trying to insert a Glyph
  from the Glyph Palette as it is wrong to be invisible to start with!)\r\n\r\nThe
  same is happening in InDesign. (Both CS2)\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\ndrj"

  body: I had that happen to me when I was replacing the tweaked font in the font
    folder with Illustrator open- and somehow corrupted some cached version of the
    font. In the end I had to make a backup of the font, erase everything, and then
    reboot- before regenerating a new version of the font. Then it worked fine.
