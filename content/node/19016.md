body: I designed a bitmap font and exported it to TTF using Font Creator. Final tests
  (Photoshop/Flash) were run, everything seemed ok, until I performed some tests on
  a Mac. Well.. there are unexpected tracking issues in Flash, ie. some characters
  overlapping. Should I prepare my fonts differently for the OSX? Is there somewhere
  I could read some more about PC/Mac differences in this area?

    exporting the font from Fontographer help?"

    the problem only happens with characters outside the [[ASCII]] area."

      sure if it's only composites that are troublesome here, as \u0141,\u0142 have
      strange tracking as well.\r\nI wonder if re-exporting the ttf's from Fontographer
      would help."
