  number for an article and don't want to be miles off :) Thx!

  body: Is my question that funny? Couldn't you tell "more than 150,000" or "almost
    200,000" and still be correct? I was hoping for that sort of number. Apologies
    if I didn't make that clear. Thanks.

    has any idea how many fonts there are out there. Yo might be able to get a handle
    on the number of commercial fonts available, but it might be near impossible to
    figure out how many free fonts are out there."

  body: The home page on the old myfonts.com site says their current offerings number
    <strong>79,465</strong>, so Simon's answer probably isn't that far off, if you
    consider the tens--if not hundreds--of thousands of freeware fonts AND fonts which
    myfonts.com isn't authorized to distribute.

    if you like.

    I cann't see what an exact number, even if an estimation, is useful for.
