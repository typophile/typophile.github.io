body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCan you please assist me with identifying current fonts that closely
  resemble those used in these figural cameos from the mid to late 1800s? I'm really
  just trying to identify a short list of fonts are similar to those that were typically
  used during that time for these pieces that were made from engraved brass metal
  dies.\r\n\r\nIf you can also please provide information on where I can find these
  brass flourishes, curves, ribbons etc. that would be very helpful as well.\r\n\r\nFor
  those interested, the collection that includes these beautiful pieces is located
  here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/figural-cameos/\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  through the type specimens in the following location but thought I'd ask for assistance
  here as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://opentype.info/blog/2008/02/18/type-specimen/\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for any help with this.\r\n\r\nJoshua\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/douglassmoore150_6682.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edmands150_6322.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/kimball150_6022.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/blumenthalschina150_3832.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/schaeffersaddle150_3995.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ddwright150_5023.jpeg]"

  body: "Perhaps you might consider splitting your request into several separate ones.\r\nSo
    lets look at the first image.\r\nThis was probably all done by hand as a \"wood
    engraving.\" In this system the fonts are actually carved lettering.\r\nBut they
    are based on designs that were familiar to the engraver.\r\nFrom top to bottom
    here some similar typefaces from the era that have been digitized.\r\nDOUGLASS
