body: "I am working on a logo for a website called 'foto8' and would like to hear
  your comments/criticisms on where I have got to thus far. \r\n\r\nBackground information:
  The logo is also to be partially used on a bi-annual magazine called '8' and I am
  working on trying to incorporate the 2 logo's in order form some kind of a cohesive
  identity (so the website is called 'foto8' and the magazine just '8' as a number).
  The style of letters used is in tune with the headline typography of the magazine,
  so I wouldn't want to deviate from that too much. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it would
  be good to have comments on how readable/effective it is as a logo; as well as ideas
  on achieving the best balance between the 'f' and the 't'; and any other comments
  would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

    for F and T and not connecting them?"

  body: "Jan, thanks for your input. \r\n\r\nI have tried cap F and T in earlier drafts,
    but wasn't really convinced (I think the lowercase letters create more interesting
    shapes). As for No.4, I have been made aware that the f and t can appear difficult
    to see when not separated in some way (hence the white line used in No's 1-3)
    and be read as some kind of arbitrary shape next to a figure 8. Could you please
    elaborate why you prefer No.4?\r\n\r\nMike"

    a really good point, and one that I had missed (probably because I have only showed
    these drafts to people who are familiar with the name already). \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    with the 8."

    idea of what your description would look like, and then when I saw your work it
    was so much better than what I was imagining.  Elegant, simple and dynamic.  Now
    just refine it and call it a day.  Good work."
