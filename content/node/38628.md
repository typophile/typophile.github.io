body: "Hi all-\r\nThere has been a lot of discussion of Michael Schwab's san serif
  fonts (concluded hand-drawn, but most like Eagle). I saw another design by him (attached)
  and was wondering if anyone could identify a similar font?\r\nThanks-\r\nIsabella"

  body: You said similar, but yeah, the C is quite different along with the serifs
    not being as rounded and the x-heights are much lower.
