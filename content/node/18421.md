  body: "You've reminded me of the particular \"swash factor\" in Baskerville.\r\nBecause
    the original italic caps had a strange \"swash distribution\",\r\nin that some
    glyphs were very \"straight\" while others were overly\r\nswashy, revivers of
    Baskerville have elected to either preserve the\r\noriginal scheme or do away
    with the swashes entirely. One elegant\r\nsolution can be found in ATF's metal
    Baskerville: non-swashy main\r\nsorts, but swashy, in fact extra-swashy, alternates.
