  printing issue and I'm hoping the experts on this forum may be able to help.\r\n\r\nMy
  issue has to do with printing PDFs that were created using a specific OpenType font
  family that I recently installed. The document looks great onscreen, but when I
  print a PDF, the printed version randomly alternates between various weights. \r\n\r\nFor
  example, text that is set in Book will print with random letters as Semi-Bold. Or
  text set in Heavy will print with random letters as Book. \r\n\r\nThis issue only
  happens when printing on machines that do not have the fonts installed, which shouldn't
  be necessary with a PDF. All other fonts in the document print fine, and a few blocks
  of text set in the problem font are fine too. I'm stumped. \r\n\r\nHave any of you
  ever encountered this problem before? I have installed the OTF versions of the fonts
  only. I also have the Font Suitcase, Windows TrueType, PostScript Type 1 and AFM
  files, but I'm not sure if I need those. I am running Mac OS X. \r\n\r\nIf you have
  any tips or suggestions, I would appreciate your help. Thanks!"

  body: "Thanks, everyone, for your help. Here's an update on the problem:\r\n\r\nI
    have tried printing the file to a few different printers from different computers.
    For some reason, the problem only happens when printing to color printers. The
    black and white versions look fine, but the color versions are garbled.\r\n\r\nToday
    I took the file to a local print shop and tried printing both color and black
    white. Again the black and white version looked great, but when I tried printing
    to their color printer I got an error message saying that one or more fonts could
    not be downloaded and that the file may not print correctly. When the page printed,
    all of the fonts were fine except for the Voice family, which was replaced with
    Courier.\r\n\r\nI've contacted the designer, but he's never encountered this problem
    before. I can't tell if it's an issue with the PDF software (I'm creating the
    PDFs using Mac OS X's built in PDF writer out of OmniGraffle and Pages) or if
    it's an issue with the Voice font. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on what might be causing
    this? I'm on deadline and would welcome any suggestions! Thanks. "

  body: "Many color printers use an emulation method instead of true Adobe PostScript.
    For the color prints, I would recommend you open the PDFs in PhotoShop and let
    it rasterize it as a Photoshop PDF. Save it then as a rasterized PhotoShop file
    but at a high enough resolution to get good output from the color printer you
    are using.  Having done this, you will not need the fonts anymore since it will
    all be pixels. Find out the resolution your service bureau needs for the color
    printer first.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    and replaced them with the PostScript versions. Not sure why this worked, but
    it fixed the problem on all of the printers that I tested.\r\n\r\nI'll look into
    Acrobat as a replacement to OS X and Preview for PDF creation moving forward.
    It sounds like it will be more reliable.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thomas has a point.  The PDF creation in OS X has no where near the features
    that Acrobat has.  It's great if you need to quickly send a document to a professor
    or something and you know they dont have the fonts or program, but not for production.
    \ In other words, for 90% of the market, it's perfectly functional.\r\n\r\nFor
    reading PDFs, the only advantage that Preview has to Adobe Reader is that it is
    MUCH faster, at least on my 1 Ghz G4.  However, form filling, and a lot of the
    group-work features of Acrobat aren't there.  \r\n\r\nAlso, as a random question,
    how do the files from OmniGraffle look when creating a PDF using the Export->PDF
    Vector?  I don't know if it uses the same core PDF creation engine or not.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
