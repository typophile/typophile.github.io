  that my company uses. We are a language company so it is most important to catalog
  our fonts by the language they support.\r\n\r\nI am running Font Explorer X on a
  MAC and a PC. To my knowledge there is no way to manage the MAC fonts with the PC
  version of FE X.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can figure out how to group the fonts by
  languages they support would be to view the details of each font and see what character
  sets it supports. Then make a comment as to which character sets the font has, e.g.
  Thai, Greek, Armenian and then create a Smart Set using the comments that I made.\r\n\r\nSo
  far, this is the only way I can think of to catalog the fonts by language support,
  which is not that appealing because it would mean that I have to go through each
  font, one by one.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide. Sorry if the solution
  seems obivious, but fonts are a whole new world to me."

    sets as I have done. I organize my fonts by foundry. \r\n\r\nHowever, I've also
    started adding comments to some of my fonts in an effort to create smart sets
    which are very useful. \r\n\r\nSo, I guess the short answer is that you have to
    do it the long way. :^/"

  body: Thanks for the reply. That was the only way that I could think of to do it,
    but I wanted to check first before I begin the process of checking 5,000+ fonts.
