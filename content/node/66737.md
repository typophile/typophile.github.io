body: "i love working with the WW2 (1930s to 1950s) timeline, i feel i presents alot
  of useful material because the history is so rich, so that really inspired this
  design for me, and PS: i understand the smaller text is hard to read and i dont
  really intend for it to be read by most people because for one its in Russian so
  if dont speak or read that language you wont be reading it anyway, but in short
  the poster is designed after the ussr era in euro, and is an anti war poster. \r\n\r\nAnd
  just to clarify the upside-down R and the transition from the S to the R, its really
  design purposes and aesthetics purposes.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/unlogic/4307910925/sizes/l/\r\n"

  body: "Looks kinda neat. I really love the texture.\r\n\r\nFor the USSR part, I
    think the layout and relation of the letters to each other could be improved.
    One thing that looks odd is the U to the two S's, which don't share the same baseline.
    I think it would look better if those letters were aligned. Second, I think the
    R would look better being joined at the same angle as the spine of the S. There's
    a nice pattern that could be created there which is broken by the angle of the
    R's stem.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I don't have much to suggest. If you haven't yet,
    I'd play around a bit with placement on the page. Center placements are often
    not the most effective layout, as there's less play for the eye in a centered
    placement."
