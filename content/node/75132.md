  I'm attempting to put together a book of fairy tales. It's the first time I've done
  something on this scale, and I'm not sure if what I've put together is working or
  not. The book will be 6 x 9 inches. The type is Arno, 13/16.2 (the weird baseline
  is simply so the grid would fit the page exactly), with occasional bits of Phaeton
  (title page, cover, and page numbers, basically). Oh, and I'm using fleurons or
  whatever they're called from several different fonts for the story title decorations.
  Thanks so much for helping out a struggling-to-learn flunky.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fairy_tales_5160.jpg]\r\n\r\nBEH"

    (relative to the other elements) and doesn't look like a T.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid
    I dislike the slick, tight fit of this text face and layout application, it strikes
    me as too bland for the genre of layout.\r\nI like antiques, even if they are
    reproduction, to have a bit of patina and be somewhat dog-eared.\r\n\r\nLook at
    the sentence break in line 11: the period is kerned under \"r\", resulting in
    a word space that is smaller than the counter of the \"G\". Compare with the sentence
    break in the next line, which is just about OK.\r\n\r\nWould it look more classic
    with a larger word space in the h&j's?\r\n\r\nAnd if you are going to be so tight
    and even, you have to solve every spacing issue, or else they really stick out
    like sore thumbs, which is the case with the long arm of \"f\" stretching across
    word spaces to interfere with following characters (see line 7)."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, Nick. I looked at a few books, and see what you
    mean about the tightness of my spacing. Here is an updated version with a quick
    change to the justification settings. Is the text box itself too narrow and long
    for the page?\r\n\r\nHow is the rest of the layout tight and bland? It feels a
    bit off-balance to me (especially this spread), but I can't pin it down. Too many
    competing elements?\r\n\r\nAlso, do you think Phaeton works in this context? I
    wanted something that wasn't feminine (these aren't just stories for girls), but
    also had a bit of the old-fashioned, fantastical tone.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fairy_tales_5150.jpg]"

  body: 'Just some nitpicking on the drop cap: I think it''s hanging too much. I would
    also probably align the top of it with the top of the small caps if I were you.
    In Norwegian it''s important that the first line is closer to the drop cap than
    the preceding lines. With a T your example is sort of acceptable, but it wouldn''t
    have been so with an H. I would feel more comfortable with a clearly marked difference
    between the first and the preceding lines, but then again there might be other
    rules in English.  '

    there is a disjunct between its crude finish and the refinement of the other typography.
    Look around for another face for the drop caps, that has as much personality,

    a bit better than Phaeton, but am still not sure about. Something to keep in mind
    also is that there are different decorative borders for other titles. They are
    mostly rectangular (extending to the text margins), and several are a good bit
    darker.\r\n\r\nriccard0, Ambicase looks like it would be a really fun font to
    use, but I think it might overshadow the lighter lines of the other elements.

    think the drop cap is more appropriate in this version and seems more harmonious
    and appropriate with the historical feel. While I am not quite as refined in my
    type education as many others who have posted in response to your request, I think
    that this version looks a better overall than your first version. I do not know
    (and perhaps there is a rule that dictates this) if I would small cap the first
    a, it seems a little lost to me, but like I said, take my critique with a grain
    of salt as it is my goal in visiting this site to LEARN about typography rather
    than to impart my knowledge."

  body: "heyfrito500,\r\n\r\nI think you're right about the 'A.' It's the result of
    a nested style which automatically small caps a certain number of words; nice
    catch.\r\n\r\nAs for the grammatical comments, it's been my experience here in
    America that if \"its\" or \"it's\" is used by the average person, it will be
    used incorrectly. \"It's\" must look more refined, since that is the popular form
    for run-of-the-mill ads. I tend to immediately cringe when I come across any form
    out of habit, whether it has been used incorrectly or not. And I also think that
    the average person would avoid \"I were\" simply because he is not sure how to
    use it correctly. Another common error is using singular and plural for the same
    subject (e.g., \"if everyone used correct grammar, they wouldn't make this mistake\").
    Or maybe my perspective is skewed because I've spent most of my life in the moderately
    rural South. (Although, in defense of the South, I still think \"y'all\" is an
    extremely useful and underrated word.)"

    face that would work better? \r\n\r\nI think I've been trying to tie together
    three elements to keep this book connected a bit to its roots (Victorian and post-Victorian
    children's fairy tales).\r\n\r\n1) Typography (heading in all caps of text font,
    wide margins with outside and top margins double the width of top and inside margins)
    \r\n2) Blatant, if not ostentatious, use of ornamentation\r\n3) Illustrations\r\n\r\nI've
    been trying to use these three things to connect the book back to the original
