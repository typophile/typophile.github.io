  in the way Typophile covers typography. While I'm quite aware of artwork communities
  (conceptart.org, CGnetworks, eatpoo.com etc) I'm looking for something that really
  focuses on product illustration and artwork, actually much like how vintage posters
  were mostly all made for advertisement. My searches all end up with studio services
  and sites like the one's mentioned above, which are more about art instead of commercial
  poster & illustration design.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Cheers!"
