body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love some feedback on these glyphs, especially from
  Greek speakers and classicists. Just in case the heavily coved serifs and x-height
  don&#39;t give it away, I&#39;m developing them as companions to ITC Bookman. <BR>

  <BR><i>[sample setting that includes several characters discussed below]</i> <BR>
  <BR>Beyond the usual distortions brought about by my latin-alphabet prejudices,
  it&#39;s not surprising that the most challenging shapes for me have been several
  archaic letters used mostly in academic contexts and for formal numeration &#40;not
  unlike the use of roman numerals in latin scripts&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not looking
  to replicate these letters&#39; historic forms in an epigraphic way, but rather
  to see how far I can stretch them into the modern face with which I&#39;m working,
  while retaining their recognizable features. <BR> <BR>As letters that never survived
  the medieval period, their basic shapes are uncial, but I want to adapt them into
  miniscule/majuscule forms. I&#39;m far from the first to try this; in fact, several
  advocates who congregate around Unicode successfully lobbied to get both forms into
  the standard over the past couple years. I&#39;ve used some of these folks&#39;
  examples and descriptions as the basis of my own doodling. <BR> <BR><b>STIGMA</b>
  <BR> <BR>The miniscule stigma is a well-established form very similar to the final
  sigma. Because the origins of this modern form are based upon medieval uncial ligatures
  of sigma and tau, the capital letter has less tradition behind it. <BR> <BR>Playing
  around with the shapes, my goal was to evoke both the lunate Sigma &#40;the source
  of the Cyrillic C [Es]&#41; and the uptick and tail of the letter&#39;s miniscule
  form. In the following image, I&#39;ve suggested an array of glyphs that increasingly
  move toward the form of the lunate Sigma; in fact, the very last one is a literal
  ligature of this letter and a capital Tau; something like the Ethel &#40;

  body: Another idea I&#39;ve entertained for the lower-case san is something like
    the following. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67697.gif"
    alt="Alternate san"> <BR> <BR>For the most part, I like it more than either my
    or the &#34;official&#34; M-derived version, although it&#39;s not as fun to draw.
    <BR> <BR>Obviously, it&#39;s based directly on the miniscule mu. It also references
    the cursive version of the Cyrillic sha &#40;English &#34;sh&#34;, Slavic &amp;scaron;&#41;,
    a phoneme which is closer to the actual sound of san than is the literally referenced
    mu. <BR> <BR>However, this is further away from the shapes that the Unicode standard
    suggests for the letter, even if the reference glyph is itself a constructed form
    with no direct historic antecedents. <BR> <BR>Comments? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Brent

  body: I like it, but I think that the <em>mu</em> looks too Latin. Can you bringe
    more "hand" into that?

  body: "You might be interested in reading my essay in issue #4 of Spatium magazine
    (soon to be republished in the Greek \"Hyphen\" journal) titled \"Latinization:
    prevention and cure\", especially since it deals with Greek to some extent. I'm
    not implying you're doing it all wrong or anything - in fact it seems like you're
    taking it very seriously, which is great. The thing is though that what we consciously
    think is \"good design\" is often not in the still-murky realm of multi-script
    type design (especially for text faces).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'I''m drawing archaic Greek letters myself at the moment, and finding it quite
    challenging. Actually, the real archaic Greek letters are fine: the problem is
    the anachronistic casing forms. I''m working in the Byzantine cursive style for
    the lowercase, and the san is particular tricky. Brent, I quite like your lowercase
    san, but it gives the appearance of having one too many strokes in it. I''ll try
    to remember to post examples of my designs when I finish them.'
