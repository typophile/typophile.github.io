  of weathered effect. Does the designer use brushes or is it a silkscreening technique
  that causes the speckles? Or is it a little of both?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B1A791_fullsize_6629.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/35521_9752892_l_4531.jpg]"

  body: "On the first sample you can create a brush in photoshop that gives you that
    finish; In Photoshop CS4 which is the one I have now I found brush 59px or 39px
    that could give you that effect.\r\nYou can also draw directly in a piece of acetate
    with a sponge and create the effect to then burn it in a silkscreen and come up
    with a result like it. \r\nThe second one could also be a big brush in photoshop,
    but I could also think that if you\r\ndon't ink a silkscreen evenly you would
    have this result.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. \r\n\r\nPatty"

    that :o)\r\n\r\nsilk screen is a visceral medium. You can create the exact effect
    you like digitally, or you can play around and you could come up with something
    magical, be it as simple as a dull and nicked squeegee, rough texture under your
    paper or some judiciously placed dirt on the screen... \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Daniel,\r\nFirst one looks as designed that way.\r\nThe second looks like
    silkscreen made without the paint (clearance after work). Or it is a scan of faxed
    picture, or bad laserprinter printout. I vote for the latest.\r\nBTW silkscreen
    could be very accurate. Macrophoto of business card I made many yers ago (for
    Ammirati, Puris, Lintas):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amirati_4141.png]\r\nmeasure
    in mm"

  body: 'seconding JanekZ; yes, screen printing can be very accurate. I used to screen
    print tiny, tiny little circuit boards using a stainless steel mesh, and -not
    sure what to call them, but sort of like pegs on circuit display boards in hydro
    generating plants that had less than a thousandth of an inch tolerance. The registration
    was set with a micrometer and a magnifying glass.  '

  body: "The second one looks like block printing. (Though Janek is probably right...it
    does look like a photocopy on a copier that's almost out of toner). \r\n\r\nHave
    an ink roller? ink it, roll it out on paper, scan it in, use it as a texture mask. "
