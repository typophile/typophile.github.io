  body: I think it's custom. That 'a' is straight out of Futura Bold but not the t's.

  body: "One of those old FontBank fonts called <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/migra.htm\">Migra
    Heavy</a> seems to be a good match for this. Those fonts were all based on other
    typefaces, but I never quite figured out what this was based on. Flyer, that E+F
    no longer sells (not the same as current Linotype one)?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I see TypeShop is selling an extended family like this that they call <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/montreal/\">Montreal</a>. The
    Heavy is exactly like 'Migra Heavy', so I think there is a common origin. (I have
    noticed that most TypeShop fonts are not original designs, and seem to be from
    the Brendel collection.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
