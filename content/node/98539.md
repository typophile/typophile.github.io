  I am wanting to make this sign for a Christmas gift. A family member who is an antique
  lover, loved this sign and wanted to buy it. She could not afford the price they
  were asking and being such a simple sign, I thought I could make as a gift for her.
  Any help that would be similar to this font, I would appreciate it greatly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2286_5740.JPG]"

    pretty idiosyncratic hand-lettering...\r\n\r\nWhat you might consider instead
    is a one-off \"logo\" of those exact letterforms, which is entirely doable with
    the nice big photo you have there. If you have a reasonable budget for that sort
    of thing you'll find many willing accomplices here, including yours truly: hpapazian

    made of this if the price is right.  It was crazy the amount of money they wanted
    for this sign of wood and red lettering.\r\n"
