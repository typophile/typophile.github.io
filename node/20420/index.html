  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was just wondering what you guys think about using more than one family san serif fonts or serif fonts on any piece of design. I am currently a design student and have been told by one of my teachers not to do it, but one of my other teachers says it&rsquo;s ok. I also have an internship doing ad design and promo stuff for my friends boutique. What do you guys think? Thankyou</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s a pretty common recommendation generally to not use more than one serif face, but dont forget that its a just a recommendation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure others would agree that there are no hard and fast rules.  If you think your design will benefit from more than one serif face, then do it.  I think the recommendation is more to stop people from &lsquo;decorating&rsquo; a page with different faces.</p>
<p>There should be purpose and reason to the faces you choose for any design.  This is a skills that i&rsquo;m still grappling to aquire.  Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s - &lsquo;The Elements of Typographic Design&rsquo; would be a good spot to start if you would like to get your head around the &lsquo;why&rsquo; of typography.  So far i&rsquo;ve found it pretty useful, although it can be a humbling read.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cody,</p>
<p>You will hear from all camps: do whatever you want because it&rsquo;s rad and the surf mags do it, don&rsquo;t ever mix two serif or sans faces&hellip;</p>
<p>How does it look to you? When I see several serif or several sans faces mixed on a page, it tells me #1: the designer didn&rsquo;t know how to use any of them, or #2: that none of them could do all the things the designer wanted (which is really more of #1, most likely).</p>
<p>The benefit of sticking to one type family is visual cohesion. Pages with a jumble of typefaces look like each element, each text box, was added by a different designer, maybe by a committee or by a government agency requiring some disclosure. If there&rsquo;s a designer involved at all, part of their job is to bring the elements on a page together, to link them all and arrange them so the page delivers its message(s) effectively. If each element is in a different typeface, how do you make them relate? Especially when they are unrelated structurally, like Bembo and Bodoni, or Syntax and Helvetica.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conceit by designers to think that a robust type family somehow can&rsquo;t handle all the levels of hierarchy necessary on a page, with Roman, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, possibly small caps, and all of those in an infinite number of sizes, and maybe an infinite selection of colors. in combination, that represents millions of ways to differentiate elements on a page, all in one type family.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a typical response of new type users to want to use a lot of them everywhere. It&rsquo;s like a teenager with makeup or clothes. The effects are usually tacky and overdone. Think Edina Monsoon.</p>
<p>This is not a plea for sterile Bauhaus rigidity and asceticism. It&rsquo;s a plea for removing the elements that are unnecessary. Several unrelated typefaces on a page together are almost always unnecessary.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think we should differ here, two sans / serif faces CAN be useful when doing editorial design, if you actually want to distinguis one element from all the others, a special typeface will help. but you could also do it of course by altering color, position, size, weight, case, italic or not.</p>
<p>im all against rules if someone wants to apply them all rigidly - im all for rules if they&rsquo;re understood as loose guidelines to follow if needed.</p>

<p>They use a couple different faces per page. Because of differing colors, weight, and cases, it works.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What Carl was saying makes a great deal of sense and exposes 95% of what I meant by &lsquo;the eye is the final arbiter&rsquo; - only explained far far far better. The only other thing I would add is that the more you move away from simplicity the harder it is to make it work and the more you need to justify your descions. So the &lsquo;rule&rsquo; you have been given is there to make your design life easier/safer. And for some or even most clients that is probably the right route. But some clinets may want something rad &amp; wicked &amp; cool. For them breaking the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; might be just right. Or not. Ultimately though you have to think about what serves the client or the message you want to put across the best. And as Thierry said: rigid compliance make little sense. It&rsquo;s thinking &amp; looking that is needed.</div>
