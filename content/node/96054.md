  read Thomas Phinney's article (http://forums.adobe.com/thread/395648) and understand
  how it works, just have a question how to place the glyphs as sets?\r\n\r\nAny help
  greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nAgata"

  body: "Thanks for your reply.\r\nYes \u2013 I've made opentype classes and changed
    the code to \"class1\" \"class2\" etc but this doesn't work. Can I rename the
    classes to \"calt1\" \"calt2\" etc instead?\r\n\r\nSorry if my question is stupid,
    this is really frying my brain!"

  body: "Not a stupid question at all, I have only just figured out some of this stuff
    and it is not necessarily clear. I have found it helpful to map the classes in
    a separate document.\r\n\r\nYes, you will want to rename the classes to match
    what you put in the features, so 'calt1:' and 'calt2:' would work. You will also
    need to ensure that the number of characters in one match the other. There are
    no doubt more complex approaches but hopefully this will work when you compile
    the features.\r\n\r\nI have found it very helpful to open a font that already
    has these features and see how the classes have been named and structured."

  body: "You're right \u2013 it's giving me the error message that it doesn't have
    the same number of elements as the replacement class. I guess making up additional
    characters to fill the spaces is the solution!\r\n"

  body: "Having looked at a fairly complex font ([[http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/eb-garamond|EB
    Garamond]]) it looks like you only need to match the number of elements if you
    are doing a direct replace in the calt feature. If you are instead, for example,
    replacing everything in a specific class with a specified character then the classes
    only need contain the relevant characters being replaced.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calt1_6017.jpg]"

  body: "Yes I thought I could separate the classes to make it work.\r\nOr, I can
    write something like sub a.1 a.1 with a.2 etc. but that will be a lot of writing.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for showing me the example \u2013\_looks very complex indeed."

  body: "You can use any name you want for classes. They are only for your convenience
    and won't be present in the generated font. \r\n\r\nWhen FontLab opens a font
    (.otf or .ttf), it decompiles the OT tables, and since there are no class names
    stored in the font, it gives them arbitrary names like calt1, calt2, etc. based
    on which features reference them.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to do the same. There's
    nothing to stop you from using more descriptive names for classes, like \"normalQ\"
    and \"fancyQ\" or whatever, and it will make your feature code much easier to
    understand."

  body: Note however that only certain characters may be used in class names (a-z,
    A-Z, 0-9, _, and period). Also, FontLab uses _ at the beginning of a class name
    to indicate a kerning class. Also, class names can't contain more than 30 characters.
