body: Someone please help me !  <BR> <BR>I have tried several font managers recently
  . I did not like them, removed them, but the trouble is that during an uninstall
  process my Windows Font Viewer has lost its PFM file association. Double-click does
  not work any more and I can&#39;t even reassociate it still sais it&#39;s no font
  file . When &#40;wherever&#41; I write &#34;fontview A.pfm&#34; it works of course
  but I&#39;d like to have the double-click back . If you had the same trouble and
  was able to solve it please help me . <BR> <BR>Thank you for your help in advance
