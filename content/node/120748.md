  body: "In principle, justification without hyphenation shouldn't be allowed ;-)\r\nIn
    the specific case, the setting and the content don't seem to create especially
    jarring gaps between words, and the general boxiness and symmetry of the design
    probably work best with justified blocks.\r\nSo, keep it on."

  body: "It depends on browser support of automatic hyphenation. But it\u2019s good
    to have it turn on because CSS standards are always evolving (albeit slowly) and
    there will be definitely a day when major browsers all support it.\r\n\r\nSafest
    option now is not to use hyphenation because you\u2019re unsure whether there
    will be people who view your website on Safari 6/7 (deprecated support for most
    CSS3 OT features), early versions of Firefox without silent updates, or worse,
    Opera.\r\nCurrent stables of Chrome and Firefox have been avidly following CSS3
    OT features for a long time. Surprisingly IE10 has been supporting more OT features
    than Chrome and Firefox (good job Microsoft).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Safari
    8 on Yosemite won\u2019t even display discretionary ligatures. No point for you,
    Apple!"

    are ways to enable hyphenation there too (I haven\u2019t investigated how it\u2019s
    done, but for example the \u201Cold\u201D Twentytwelve Wordpress default theme
    do it)."

    not use any hyphenation at all? I apply hyphenation to my websites using Javascript
    and it seems to work fine. Even if some browsers don't support whatever method
    you're using to hyphenate, it shouldn't cause any problems for the browsers that
    don't support it, does it? It would simply not hyphenate, which is the default
    anyway."

      read CSS hyphens (or load your JS in weird ways) would stretch word spacing
      to justify. That would look horrible."

    testing it in Opera but they use the same engine. Am I right to assume that Javascript

    hyphens anyway? Do they make use of the font or does it attempt to do something
    more creative?"

    body: "Loading JS is sometimes viewed by web designers/developers as the inferior
      method, because one always strives to reduce page load. The more extra JS you
      load, the more manipulation to DOM, and the more time it takes to present the
      page. That\u2019s why web typographers are so frantic about new CSS standards,
      which, once established and supported, would enable the same hyphenation function
      without JS.\r\n\r\nAutomatic hyphenation support (the <em>hyphens</em> selector)
      is still in the very early stages in CSS (it\u2019s not even in CSS3 but only
      a Working Draft). Consequently a few major browsers still don\u2019t support
      this selector (Opera being the worst and IE10 being the best supporter right
      now).\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this in Mozilla\u2019s network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens
      and also about when to hyphenate: http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/hyphenate/\r\n\r\nCSS-supported
      hyphenation is achieved through manipulating browsers\u2019 text rendering engine.
      Letting the text engine do the work has nothing to do with the font file (I
      don\u2019t know how it would handle ligatures though \u2013 I think it would
      just break it up if necessary). This is in a sense more \u201Cauthentic\u201D
      (native) than Javascript, which calculates block width and inserts hyphens in
      separate tiny divs.\r\n\r\nLettering.js (http://letteringjs.com) mainly uses
      JS to achieve typographic exercises on web without browser native support. This
      is rather clumsy, but the best workaround you can get."

  body: Another factor is that some folks will bump up the minimum font size in their
    browser's settings, so line breaks and spacing may be different than you expect.  I
    wear bifocals and often make website type larger.

    are getting so good, it should become less and less of a problem. Obviously you

    before I start using it."
