    you're looking at. i rarely see gotham around here for example, but helvetica
    is everywhere. \r\nmy brother, who has nothing to do with typography except through
    me, even started to say \"oh, thats helvetica, right?\" when i tell him about
    some signage, just because in 99% of the cases, its correct."

    Appendix C, \"Typeface popularity\" in <em>Methods of Book Design</em> by Hugh
    Williamson, second edn., pub. Oxford University Press, 1966. This was two lists
    of the twelve typefaces most frequently appearing in the National Book League's
    Annual Exhibition (of just over 800 books per exhibition) in the postwar years
    in England.\r\n\r\nFrom 1945-55, in ranking order; Bembo, Baskerville, Times,
    Fournier, Imprint, Perpetua, Walbaum, Garamond, Bell, Plantin, Poliphilus, Caslon.\r\n\r\nFrom
    1956-63, in ranking order; Bembo, Baskerville, Plantin, Times, Fournier, Poliphilus,
    Garamond, Bell, Ehrhardt, Imprint, Walbaum, Caslon.\r\n\r\nThe author goes on
    to say that the top two of these accounted for more than one third of the books
    exhibited, Bembo being used for over 50% more books than Baskerville, and Baskerville
    in turn, being used for  over 50% more books than Times, it's nearest rival over
    the whole period. \r\n\r\nFor my part, please note that Arial, Comic Sans, Courier,
    Franklin Gothic, Gill Sans, Helvetica, Univers, Verdana etc. appear nowhere here.
    But then these lists are really just about pre-digital British book typography.

    were the ''Microsoft'' of its day, dominating the market. Monotype actually had
    a small portion of the market, mainly a portion of the book market. Hence world
    wide a different list of Latin faces would be relevant. Also if you just look
    at sheer volume of print, probably newspaper typefaces from Linotype would dominate. '

    the prepress department had loused up, and it stayed that way for months.\r\n\r\nAs

    an equivalent. It did have a Baskerville. By the way, I suspect that Ben's list
    was first edition hard back books. If you looked at paperbacks in that period--which
    probably sold more--I think Times New Roman would be much higher on the British
    list. "

    dominated but the letterpress fonts. And of course a list of most common fonts
    depends on a question 'Where, in which country?'.\r\n\r\nTo answer it for Germany,
    I'ld say:\r\n\r\nHelvetica (D.Stempel)\r\nFolio (Bauersche Giesserei)\r\nGaramond
    (D.Stempel)\r\nPalatino (D.Stempel)\r\nBodoni (Bauersche Giesserei)\r\nAkzidenz-Grotesk
    (H.Berthold)\r\nFutura (Bauersche Giesserei)\r\nSuper-Grotesk (after 1945 TypoArt)\r\nGaramond
    (TypoArt)\r\nLithographia (Bauersche Giesserei)\r\n\r\n90 percent of all typesetting
    departments of letterpress companies we buy, hold above listed fonts. Not all
    of them but mostly one Grotesk and one Antiqua.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bleisetzer.de\"target=\"_blank\"class=\"link\">Preu\xDFisches
