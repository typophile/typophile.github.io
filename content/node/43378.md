    my browser?\"\r\n\r\nFWIW, it doesn't display for me either on any of the following
    browsers: Firefox 3 Beta 4, Internet Explorer 7, Opera 9.50 beta, Safari 3.1 (all
    under Windows).\r\n\r\nThis issue has been <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/41570\">discussed
    before</a>."

    did show up quite nicely until I visited this little French typography site, where
    this funny little \"T\" decided to off the Typophile favicon and to attach it's
    self to the Typophile bookmark tab and now, it won't go away. It just struck me
    as kind of an odd little quirk. or maybe... international intrigue. :-)\r\n\r\nDon,
    agreed. Sometimes a worrd is worth a thousand pictures. I thopught that funny
    lookin' \"T\" would speak for it's self.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
