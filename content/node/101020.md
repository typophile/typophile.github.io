body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a standard encoding for my fonts, but there
  are some glyphs that FontLab doesn't recognice, or even defines with incorrect unicode.
  Theese are the ones i've been having problems:\r\n\r\nGermandbls (should be U+1E9E)\r\nTcedilla
  (should be U+0162)\r\nTcommaaccent (should be U+021A)\r\ntcedilla (should be U+0163)\r\ntcommaaccent
  (should be U+021B)\r\n\r\nIs there any way to creating a encoding (.enc) that gives
  name+unicode to each glyph?"

    thing is that when I use my encoding in FontLab those glyphs have the wrong Unicode."

    Studio you can define your own .enc file and FLS can use it. Check the manual
    (page 154) or the FontLab Forum for more information about your particular platform.\r\n"

    that problem I would ask about it in the FontLab Forums.

  body: "Name-to-Unicode mappings are stored in .nam files in the \\FontLab\\Shared\\Mapping
    folder, independent of the .enc files in the \\Encoding folder. So you set up
    the name-to-Unicode mappings in a .nam file, and then use those names in a .enc
    file. In FontLab, you then need to use the 'Generate Unicode' dialogue in the
    Glyph/Glyph Names menu to select a default .nam to use. [Note that every once
    in a while, FontLab will revert to its Standard .nam and you will need to reset
    the default.]\r\n\r\nPS. I recommend creating your own .nam files, even if based
    on those provided by FontLab, rather than editing the Standard .nam."

    FL Studio 5.0.4 installation deficient? "

  body: Somewhat confusingly, FontLab can store .enc, .nam, etc. and also macros in
    more than one location. The default location on Windows is not the folders in
    FontLab's app folder, but the ones at [User]\My Documents\FontLab. Check there.
