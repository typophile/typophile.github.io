  ID Pop Quiz, possibly -- but not necessarily -- providing a hint.</li>\r\n<li>Try
  to identify the typeface. To win, you need to <strong>e-mail me the correct name

  enthusiasts to participate.</strong></i>\r\n<li>Show off your knowledge by casually
  mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first)
  published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>Every
  Monday a new challenge will be posted by the first person to e-mail me the correct
  answer. The sample should be two lines of centered text (minimum 36 pt), black on
  white background, presented in a 480 x 160 pixel rectangle, including a R204G000B00
  1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The person who posts a challenge can't win the next
  game.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging
  angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is too easy, maybe try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/intermediate_level\">Intermediary

    to reboot the Type ID Pop Quiz - Entry Level. New challenge, new rule. What doesn't
    change, is that you don't reply within the thread, but e-mail me the solution
    through my profile. What changes is that the first one to send me the correct
    answer has until next Monday to prepare a new challenge.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Entry-level_080721_4161.gif]"

    forget this is an entry level quiz, Robbie, so don't pick a too obscure face.
    And preferably incorporate a hidden hint in the words or sentence used for the

    planned to have each challenge last one week, because these are going to be found
    far too easily by some, and then the true beginners have no time to participate...
    :^/\r\n\r\nCan we hold off from the new challenge for a little while and keep
    the current one going a little longer?"

    just need to repost it next Monday.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand the majority feels
    this should also be a fast-paced quiz, just tell me and we'll forget about the
    time restriction. I certainly wouldn't want to make the same mistakes Spongebob
    Squarepants made. Now <em>that's</em> a lousy reference. ;^)"

  body: "The answer to last weeks question was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-souvenir/|ITC
    Souvenir]].\r\n\r\nA few interesting facts about Souvenir : It was originally
    designed as a single-weight typeface, by Morris Fuller Benton in 1914, it was
    redrawn in 1972 by Ed Benguiat to include the different weights and italics shown
    in Robs sample above. This was Benguiat's first project for the International
    Typeface Corporation (ITC) which he had helped to set up. According to Elisa Halperin
    at The Art Directors Club Souvenir became lTC's best selling typeface and goes
    on to call it \"the face everybody loves to hate\".\r\n\r\nNow my turn. There
    is a bit of a hint in the sample text I've written if you care to do some googling.
    The sample shows the Regular and Bold weights of this typeface, there is also
    an Italic available. Good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quiz
