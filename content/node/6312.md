  feedback concerning FF Fago and its real world <BR>use. I am thinking about putting
  this family into good use as a corporate type for one of our clients. <BR>The \xABabstract\xBB
  properties, like mood and aura ^_^ are matching the corporate image nicely. The
  <BR>jobs it will be involved with range from print ads to packaging and, the biggest
  one, consumer <BR>catalogues with a product range of roughly 7000 products. The
  job nowadays is being done with <BR>Syntax family. <BR> <BR>While layouting a catalogue
  with Fago, we noticed that it seems to \xABdance\xBB a bit and looks like it <BR>isn&#39;t
  spaced perfectly &#40;we cannot count with manual spacing and kerning for the catalogue
  of 300 <BR>pages in 5 languages in 2 variants&#41;. <BR> <BR>So my question is \u2014
  has anybody used Fago heavily enough to tell me good and bad things about <BR>it?
  <BR> <BR>ps. There is another type striving to take Syntax&#39; place as a corporate
  type \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_faceplate.html\">Faceplate</a>
  from <BR>Psyops. We have to decide very soon."

    cool. Fago&#39;s advantage is \u2014 it has condensed and extended versions. Condensed
    type with <BR>lining figures is something very useful for tables full of technical
    data."

    etc&#41;. Maybe these would be able to give you enough change, without having
    to switch families. <BR> <BR>What about FF Unit?

  body: Hey Dan! We were using the good old Syntax with three cuts - roman, bold and
    black. Good to know, that there is a new Syntax out there with even more cuts
    and matching serifs, but it seems like we two, working on this project, want to
    leave Syntax in peace for now. <BR> <BR>The problem I see &#40;or maybe I imagine
    to see&#41; is not the font itself, not the forms or style of the letters, but
    mostly such stuff as [potential] spacing problems and the ease of work with the
    given font. Optical spacing could solve the problem, at least partly. In case
    we use InDesign all over, of course. But Quark is still being used for the old
    catalogue layout and as far as I know, there is no such feature as optical spacing
    in QXP. :/

  body: Nothing wrong with switching the font. Don&#39;t have any better recommendations
    myself, though. I&#39;d be willing to bet that the new Syntax is better spaced
    than the old one, but don&#39;t quote me on that. Moot point anyway, since you
    are going to change.

  body: I bought a weight of Fago a long time ago, and I  <BR>also noticed the irregular
    spacing you describe. <BR>It seems in particular to affect the &#39;a&#39;, with
    too <BR>wide a bearing on the right.

    the old one <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know... The trend with these latest re-revivals
    seems to be about 50-50 on the spacing front. <BR> <BR>Alexey, I suggest you test
    Fago with InDesign&#39;s optical spacing so you can nail down the problem. If
    it solves it, but you have to use Quark overall, then maybe commission a re-spacing,
    which could be as simple &#40;technologically&#41; as giving it an add-on kerning
    file for German. <BR> <BR>hhp'
