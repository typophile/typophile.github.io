    is it that noone seems to notice  the by-line \"All topics are welcome\u2014except

  body: Re identifying web fonts, reading the raw HTML and CSS will surprisingly often
    be enough. Web browsers, at least of the Firefox class, let you do so easily.

  body: Just a thought - How about making a Font Identification logo banner out to
    the right, just like what is done for "Follow Typophile on Twitter"?  I imagine
    Typophile even could have a design contest for it.

    out to be no less important, though in a different field.\r\n\r\n[[http://anandam.name/source_verifier/]]\r\n\r\nIt
    calculates hashes for a web page and any included Javascript files, giving the
    user a chance to spot if something has changed somewhere."
