  body: "Hi John;\r\n\r\nWhen makeotf fails at parsing a parsing a feature file, it
    lists the keywords that are legal in the current context.  It saw the keyword
    \"lookup\", when it was expecting one of the tokens that it lists in the message\r\n\r\nFrom
    comments on another e-mail thread, I think that you got your syntax problems fixed.\r\n\r\n-

  body: 'Thanks, Read. Karsten helped me resolve this. There were a couple of issues:
    syntax problems in the feature file extracted from a FontForge source, and the
    fact that I had an older AFKDO build installed.'
