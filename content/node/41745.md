body: "Hi im doing an OpenType font on FontLab5.0\r\n\r\nThere are some glyphs that
  allow you to create the small caps\r\nthey are called: \"Asmall, Bsmall, Csmall,
  Dsmall, etc...\"\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when I go to IndesigCS2 it doesent recongnise
  the smallcaps I made.\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder...\r\n\r\nIs there a code that I have
  to put on the OpenType pannel on Fontlab to make the small caps function?\r\n\r\nI
  hope someone can answer :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I also want to activate the numbers called
  \"oldstyle\" (smallcaps)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nFerch"

  body: "Yes,\r\n\r\nFirst turn your \"Asmall\" into \"A.smcp\" etc.\r\n\r\nin your
    classes panel make \r\n3 new opentype classes:\r\none being _ smcp1: \"a.smcp
    b.smcp c.smcp d.smcp e.smcp f.smcp g.smcp h.smcp i.smcp j.smcp k.smcp l.smcp m.smcp
    n.smcp o.smcp p.smcp q.smcp r.smcp s.smcp t.smcp u.smcp v.smcp w.smcp x.smcp y.smcp
    z.smcp\"\r\nand the second being _ \"upca1: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q
    R S T U V W X Y Z\"\r\nand the last one _ \"lowca1: a b c d e f g h i j k l m
    n o p q r s t u v w x y z\"\r\n\r\nin the opentype panel add 2 new featues.\r\nthe
    first one:\r\nfeature smcp {\r\n  sub @lowca1 by @smcp1;\r\n} smcp;\r\nthe second
    one\r\nfeature c2sc {\r\n  sub @upca1 by @smcp1;\r\n} c2sc;\r\n\r\nThe smcp feature
    changes your lowercase glyps in that class into smallcaps. And the c2sc feature
    kicks in when you select all smallcaps in indesign. You can add glyphs into the
    groups but make sure that there is an equal amount of glyphs in each group. Then
    compile and export your font. Should work."
