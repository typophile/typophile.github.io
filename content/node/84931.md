  me.\r\n\r\nMy business name is Adunate (adunate - very symmetric if done in certain
  types). It's Latin for unite because I unite graphic design and writing for successful
  communication. My target markets are home building industries, historic architecture/preservation,
  coffee, wine, food, religious organizations and other random businesses.\r\n\r\nI
  used the tiled pattern (log cabin pattern in quilting) in my old logo. It reflects
  the idea of parts coming together to make a whole, plus it represents the arts &
  crafts I'm fond of. I've recently added the art nouveau-style curves. It adds an
  organic element, plus its another style I'm very fond of.\r\n\r\nChoosing a typeface
  has become my dilemma!\r\n\r\nI really like the contrast that Cezanne offers, done
  in lower case. However, given my business name is already difficult, I fear it complicates
  it further. Plus Cezanne is becoming overdone.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any suggestions?
  They don't even need to be anything like Cezanne. I'm open to every idea."

  body: Thanks Te Rowan. Actually, it's not so far out. I've been playing around with
    something very simplistic and clean and liking how it looks. I'd like this to
    be a long term logo, therefore I need to stay with a longstanding type as well.
    Thanks!

    the full double-sided serifs on the \"d\" would say something.\r\n\r\nBTW, is
    it too late to switch to \"Adnate\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
