body: I'm looking for a description of how condensed and compressed fonts differ.
  Some large families now contain both, so I'm interested in how type designers intend
  the two versions to be used. I apologize in advance if this has been covered before.
  Is it in the wiki?

  body: "<cite>Condensed = Narrow\r\nCompressed = Narrower</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is certainly
    true of fonts such as Interstate. Are \"compressed\" fonts just a recent phenomenon
    resulting from the need to describe two degrees of condensation? Are there any
    fonts with a compressed version for which there is no condensed variant?"
