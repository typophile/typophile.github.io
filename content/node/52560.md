    all,\r\n\r\nWell, I never knew if or when this day would come, but I am leaving
    Adobe after 11 1/2 years. Adobe HR made me an offer I can't refuse, so away I
    go. On the plus side, I needed to spend some more time with my family due to my
    younger daughter's medical needs anyway. I will be looking at consulting, writing
    and teaching gigs, and perhaps going back to a full time job at some time next
    year. Let me know if you have any good prospects for somebody with lots of type
    background/skills and an MBA from UC Berkeley.  :)\r\n\r\nIt has been both a great
    pleasure and an honor to work with so many smart, knowledgeable and decent people
    in my time at Adobe, and to help make some great typefaces and applications.\r\n\r\n[deleted]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT</cite>\r\n\r\n(End
    of citation)\r\nStill, I hope to still see around you in future, T. Maybe at the
    next TypoBerlin? (Cite tags not working, sorry)\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: This is sad news! From about 1995 to 2000, David Lemon was Adobe's universally
    admired online type community voice, and since then Thomas has filled his shoes
    so well. I have been a well-known thorn in his side for most of these years, but
    as Thomas's technical and institutional wisdom grew with every year, it has become
    harder and harder to find fault. I do think it's a shame for Adobe to part with
    someone who has done so much for the company in so many ways, and whose loyalty
    is so admirable. It is impossible to think of the contemporary online type community
    without Thomas's unflagging generosity. Very best wishes, Thomas!

    shared with us on Adobe's behalf over the years. I just solved a HUGE font problem
    of mine by tracking down a post you made about six years ago and it really saved
    the day. Thanks a ton for all the info, advice and insights. Looking forward to
    your continued presence in a new position in the type world. good luck to you
    and your family!

    in annual revenue and dominant in its field, that has enjoyed a lengthy period
    of growth and profits, cooly lays off thousands of workers (\"everyone's doing
    it, we're matching average industry rates\" according to the boss) when there's
    a downturn in the economy. Somewhat callous, but sensible business practice apparently,
    although there are always apologists lamenting that those companies are losing
    their best and brightest.\r\n\r\nFrom the employee perspective, loyalty is not
    reciprocated, but on the up side, it's during recessions that discarded workers
    form the start-ups that become the kernels of the next wave. I was laid off during
    downturns a couple of times, long ago before I started working for myself, and
    it was always a great opportunity. "
