body: "I have a question for the community. I am pricing a OEM license request from
  a large corporation that produces software products. They want fully paid up, unlimited,
  perpetual but non-exclusive distibution rights to two of my most popular retail
  families. I do project that this agreement would have perpetual negative impact
  on those families retail sales, from this agreement, onward.\r\n\r\nAll other requests
  I have received have been on a smaller scale; Video games, single software packages
  or small corporation, with no distribution rights. I have decided to price this
  quote by multiplying my projected annual revenue from these fonts times 6 (which
  is conservative, compared to a recommendation by an IP lawyer). Any thoughts on
  that methodology? Any other suggested methods?\r\n"

    would jump at the chance. Don't sell yourself short; aim for what the lawyer recommended.
