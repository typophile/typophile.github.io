body: "Which one is your favorite one? \r\n\r\nI know that this is a very broad question...
  but I am very interested in hearing different opinions on this. I did use the search
  engine here to answer this as well, but have not found a similar topic so far. If
  anyone remembers of something similar being posted and asnwered on Typophile please
  let me know. I would highly appreciate it!\r\n\r\n\r\nEncyclopedia of Typefaces
  says that grotesks that follow the German or continental model use a single storey
  \u2019g\u2019 while grotesques that follow the traditional English pattern use a
  double storey \u2019g\u2019. This difference is the basis of grotesque (double storey)
  and neo-grotesque (single storey) as separate classifications. (Which was posted
  by \r\nlong time ago Mr. Ben Archer and I thank him for answering that question!)\r\n\r\nWell;
  there is also a variety of the humanist sans serif typefaces with single-story versions
  of g (like Eras, Rotis, Myriad, Stone Sans...). There is probably more in this category,
  but unfortunately I can not find any of them... Any idea?\r\n\r\nThe one that I
  like the best so far is Officina's lowercase g... \r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
