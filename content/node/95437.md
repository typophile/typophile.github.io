body: "As I am well aware, my behavior of late has been inexcusable. My descent into
  madness began a little after this blatant, unpunishable and unstoppable character
  assassination of my brand was posted on the Craigslist Philosophy Forum. Combined
  with a downward trajectory in font sales, an inability to launch a separate, totally
  error-free adjunct revenue stream, a gamble that I wouldn\u2019t need health insurance
  until I reach 65 next year, and having nothing of value to support my wife, should
  she outlive me, I went a little nuts. In fact, nuts enough to make my wife feel
  compelled to by institutionalized, rather than live with me.\r\n\r\n<!--<img src=\"http://www.nicksfonts.com/depot/adios.png\"
  />-->\r\n\r\nFinally, yesterday, a blood test revealed an unexpected anomaly in
  my liver function put the figurative last nail in the coffin. I hereby surrender:
  the big money rules. Make me an offer for my complete collection (over 1,000 finished
  fonts and almost 200 abandoned in various stages of production) in a manner that
  will insulate my soon-to-be ex-wife of any tinge of guilt by association for my
  insufferable crime of disagreeing with the reigning sociopath in an online forum.\r\n\r\nYour
  money, my life\u2019s work: name a price, and the two lunatics will consider\u2014once
  she is released.\r\n\r\nP.S. Mods\u2014be sure to delete the evidence, especially
  if it is for MY protection. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.\r\n"

    resurrecting and preserving tons of hand lettered typefaces, which otherwise would

  body: "Thanks, Pablo\u2014\r\n\r\nI appreciate your sentiment and your efforts to
    assist where most others would not dare.\r\n\r\nI also have ten or twelve boxes
    of type specimen books, sign-painter's manuals and related bibliophilia which
    I had hoped to offer to the Library of Congress (many are not in the collection,
    and the only copy of BB&S catalog #25 is in the Rare Book Room, which makes access
    limited and tedious. For obvious reasons, the name of the donor will now read
    \"Anonymous.\"\r\n\r\nEven my plans to donate the remainder of those books not
    accepted to colleges and universities in doubtful, except as noted. Good thing
    I don't qaulify for tax deductions anyway.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am reasonably confident
    that the three million+ people who downloaded my free fonts will continue to download
    them, ask for free tech support and/or figure out a way to make a buck on a free
    gift of love\u2026but not contribute a dime in appreciation. Wow.\r\n\r\nEven
    better: all evidence of malfeasance have been removed from Craigslist PhiFo. Blank
    pages indicate massive eradication of content. Except where I saved the pages
    offline. Maybe a bit of paranoia is in order, Or not."

  body: "I can relate to the part about tech support for free fonts wearing you down.
    You make free fonts and in return you get a full email inbox every day for the
    rest of your life. It's not without its rewards but it's just relentless.\r\nIf
    I could do it all over again, I'd make them all public domain and release them
    anonymously.\r\n\r\nIs there a possibility you could nuke this thread and present
    the sale of your font collection in a more professional way? If anyone is going
    bankroll this it'll probably be some corporate types rather than one of us indies.
    I can't picture the cock going over well in an inter-office memo. Or maybe, I
    dunno."

  body: "Nick, sorry to hear about your difficulties; sounds like a very tough situation.
    \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind a suggestion, I'm sure that in your city there are social
    service agencies that can offer free advice and assistance to those who have financial,
    medical, legal, and other issues. You mentioned you're in your 60s, so a phone
    call to your local senior citizens' organization might be a good place to start,
    as they could suggest which specific organizations might be able to assist you.
    \r\n\r\nMy church works closely with similar organizations in my community, and
    I've seen many fine people who found themselves in tough situations who were helped
    by these organizations."

  body: "Nick, a little simple suggestion:\r\n\r\nIn Dafont, you can easily add your
    Paypal email account and start getting donations right away. (LogIn -> MyAccount
    -> Donate Link)\r\n\r\nAll the donations goes 100% to your account, and usually
    range from $5 to $25.-\r\nGiven that you have 113 fonts and about 5000 downloads
    per day, I guess you will get many donations. They are small, but can accumulate
    quickly and provide you with some extra income.\r\n\r\nIn my little experience,
    people are always happy to donate when provided with the Donation button. I will
    also happily donate and encourage all my social network to donate as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would talk to Monotype.  It's probably correct that none of us around here
    have the kind of spare cash you'd be looking for.  MyFonts might be interested
    as well, especially if you're looking to sell these outright and make no more
    income off them.

    run over every day, people get used up to their very death.  It happened to my

    bore you with the details.\r\n\r\noldnick, your work will speak for itself, take
