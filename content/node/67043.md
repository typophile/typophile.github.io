  it.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI had previously tended to assume that it was Caslon. Looking
  closer, I thought that perhaps the letter e at the end was tilted deliberately.
  Then I noticed that the g was the wrong shape to match with any oldstyle font I
  knew of, so I did a little web search rather than bothering the Type ID board on
  something for which the answer presumably was well-known.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, there
  were articles discussing the history of the famous Google logo at length. When I
  saw a specimen of Catull, seeing it to be a calligraphic face, I was quite surprised
  - I was never expecting the lowercase a, for example, to have such an idiosyncratic
  shape."
