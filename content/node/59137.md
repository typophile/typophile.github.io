  is 12pt in LaTeX, but the slides will be projected on a large screen. So the question
  is which family variant:\r\n\r\n\"regular\"?  or \"display\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I cannot imagine how one could make this type of decision without some testing.
    When you are working in a transitory media like slides, you really should do a
    few tests, and then see how they look in final output (preferably in the same
    room, with the same equipment, if you can).

  body: If you're presenting black text on white, keep in mind that the white light
    will tend to bloom around the letter shape more than it will on a printed page.
    Bolder might be be better.
