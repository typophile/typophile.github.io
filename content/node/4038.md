    what&#39;s the corresponding function at an ad agency. a slightly odd thing to
    ask at typophile, perhaps. but well well. do you know <BR> <BR>&#40;originalare
    is the person who does the bidding of the AD so to speak, the guy who takes sketches
    or whatever and makes them into the printable product&#41; '

    <BR> <BR>but this person doesn&#39;t &#34;design&#34; anything. he/she just &#34;executes&#34;
    and is not involved in the design process at all, and not allowed to take any
    design decisions. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s similar to the construction worker that must
    follow the architect&#39;s blueprint. '
