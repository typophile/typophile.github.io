  match yet.\r\n\r\nThis was used in the 70's for the titles on some paperback books
  published by New English Library. The closest I've been able to come is Century
  725 Black by Bitstream.\r\n\r\nWith only the small three letter sample (I couldn't
  find any other samples of the same face) it's been a bit difficult using the type
  identification tools available on the web.\r\n\r\nThe things that make this not
  quite Century 725 Black are the arm in the center of the F having a bit less vertical
  flair in the serif and the thin stroke on the X passing through as one continuous
  line instead of being offset on the left and right. Also the serifs in the sample
  appear to be a bit thicker.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."

  body: "Wichita Serial XBold is close but still not perfect. I found it on WhatTheFont
    when I submitted the sample. The serifs appear to be a bit heavier, the curves
    for the counter of the O at the top and bottom aren't as rounded (a bit more angular),
    as are the area where the heavy stroke in the X meet the serifs (in the sample
    there is a curve but Wichita has a sharp angle).\r\n\r\nI've set it aside as the
    fallback typeface if I can't find the original.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "This one is turning out to be a bit of an anomaly. Is there any chance that
    where the serifs join (brackets), the image has 'filled in' and become rounded.
    I'm wondering if it's more of a Bodoni style font....\r\n\r\n.... or shall I just
    shut up and get my coat !!!"

    body: "I went back at took a closer look at the source and you're right, the brackets
      are bring filled in and becoming rounded in the sample. The join is sharper
      and angled like in Wichita Serial XBold in the original source. I'm a bit more
      partial the rounded brackets as I think it looks better but this does make Wichita
      a more perfect match. My apologies to Herb VB for not considering this in my
      reply to him.\r\n\r\nFrom my research on the web when I was looking up SoftMaker
      it appears that most if not all of their typefaces are knockoffs of typefaces
      from other foundries. Would you happen to know on which font Wichita Serial
      XBold is based? I had looked at several Bodoni variants (Bodoni Poster in particular)
      but could not find one that seems a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThanks"

      body: Before I posted the Softmaker font I looked as much as I could for whatever
        it is/was copied or cloned from, but was unsuccessful.  I suppose it's possible
        that Softmaker/B&P/Brendel/etc. incorporated  some changes to the fonts they
        copied that made them unique.
