body: "My yet-to-be-named typeface has changed a lot since I [[http://typophile.com/node/89999|posted
  my first drafts here]], so I decided to star another topic.\r\n\r\nI dropped most
  of the serifs, and left only those of them which enhance readability. The idea behind
  that was to \"trap\" each glyph in some sort of rectangular box  and thus  separate
  it from the rest in order for it to be processed more easily.\r\nI also made the
  widths of the glyphs close to equal, to enhance this effect.\r\n\r\nClick to open
  the thumbnails in a biggers size:\r\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/46459223/rounded%20slab/version%202/03.png\"

  width=\"550px\" >\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nRight now I am on a quest of making it render properly
  in small sizes (not much success, so far): \r\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/46459223/rounded%20slab/version%202/01.png\"

  width=\"550px\" >\r\n</a>\r\n I also plan to add cyrillic support(this is the first
  draft):\r\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/46459223/rounded%20slab/version%202/05.png\"
