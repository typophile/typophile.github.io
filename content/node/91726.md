  How can you see is an adaptation of existing typography. I thought it was a Futura,
  but the capital S does not correspond to that family and that's where I started
  to doubt ...\r\nIt can be a Futura, but somehow type foundry  I unknown?\r\n\r\nIf
  someone in the photo can help me, thank you very much!\r\n\r\nMarc Salinas\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4946.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4908.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Marc,\r\n\r\nI'm glad being of some help :)\r\nand thank you for your
    compliments about Find my Font.\r\n\r\nIn fact we are now in beta testing of an
    even better version \r\n(a major update to be deployed in a few weeks),\r\nwhich,
    in addition to local font matching -fonts in your PC as the current version does-\r\nit
    will also be able to identify 10ths of thousand of commercial and free fonts \r\nusing
    our online font matching information database.\r\n\r\nIt will be deployed at the
    same price,\r\nand it will be a free upgrade for all existing Find my Font Pro
    customers.\r\nWhen the time comes, I will make an official announcement \r\nhere
    in typophile/software forums.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day\r\nFivos"

    your comment I checked some of Hrant messages,\r\nand I have to say they are -at
    least- right justified,\r\nwhile mine are really weird.\r\nAnother thing to tell
    my therapist I suppose :)\r\n\r\n(that's the result when your mother is a poet,\r\nand
    you finally become a computer programmer:\r\nA real weird hybrid!)"

  body: "Economy notwithstanding, linebreaks should indeed ideally follow the content,
    even for prose.\r\n\r\nIn the late 80s I typeset a children's book my father had
    written (it was the first time one of my fonts was going to be used for a book)
    and I'm still proud of how I made the linebreaks support the pace of reading.\r\n\r\nMy
    father was skeptical at first, but a couple of Armenian-language teachers pointed
    out how helpful the custom linebreaks were.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
