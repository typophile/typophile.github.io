body: "This typeface looks a lot like Caslon. However, the capital T, and the heavier
  weight of the thin strokes seems to eliminate that possibility (as well as the possibility
  of a Binney and Robinson Oldstyle or the faces closely derived from that). The T
  has the flaring of a Caslon, but reduced to about 1/3 the normal value.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-caslon1_6614.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  type sample is from \"Memories of a Blue Jacket\" by Patrick Riley, published in
  1928. This first specimen shows some of the italic.\r\n\r\nThis second sample shows
  the upper-case J, which definitely is like that of Caslon:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-caslon2_4241.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  this image, blurry on the right side, unfortunately, shows the capital Q, which
  is one of the possible shapes for Caslon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-caslon3_5680.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  may be so nondescript a typeface as to be difficult to identify, or in such common
  use that I should not have needed to ask; I cannot tell."

  body: Looking through some older specimen books, in particular that from the Keystone
    foundry, has led me to the conclusion that this face does not lie outside the
    limits of what could have been sold under the name of Caslon Old Style, even though
    I have not found an exact match yet.

  body: "I think it's Imprint, a regularized Caslon, with shorter extenders, from
    Monotype (1913). Quite a good type. Edward Johnston was one of those involved
    in this revival. The digital versions, as usual, look a bit anemic compared to
    the letter press print. \r\n\r\nThere are digital versions both from [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/SearchPage.htm?kid=imprint|Monotype]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/imprint-urw/|from URW]]. "

  body: "I think you're right. Looking at the digital version, the specific peculiarities
    of the Q and the T are exactly matched. And this isn't due to ink spreading (the
    printing being much too recent for that), but due to the face being digitized
    at a large size - corresponding to a discussion about Caslon Oldstyle on a Linotype
    web page involving Gerald Giampa.\r\n\r\nI had noticed that this face still had
    long extenders - at least compared to Caslon 540, but I had missed the fact that
    they are shorter than those of real Caslon.\r\n\r\nI was also going to mention
    one thing I had forgotten: the book's publisher is Sampson Low, Marston & Co.
    Ltd, and more importantly, it notes that it is \"Printed in Great Britain by Purnell
    and Sons\".\r\n\r\nIn looking for an ex-copyright book from that printer on Google
    Books - I couldn't find one - I found that they printed one of the early editions
    of H. Rider Haggard's She: A History of Adventure."

  body: 'On 540 and other Caslons. The ATF Caslon 540 was an interpretation of the
    larger sizes of Caslon, which do have shorter extenders. The different sizes of
    the originals have different designs, especially the largest sizes. The extenders
    are shortest at small sizes, then increase up to a heading size of 18 pt (Great
    Primer), where they are quite generous, and at largest sizes are quite short again.
    I''m not sure at what point above 81 pt they get smaller, as I haven''t measured
    it. I think the Imprint extenders are a bit shorter than Caslon''s in the 10-12
    pt range.    '

  body: Incidentally, I found that the Q and the T do match on one form of Caslon
    Old Style, as well as with Imprint. The illustration of the Caslon Old Style of
    the Stephenson Blake foundry in "Anatomy of a Typeface" shows the same Q and T.
    So this could have been the inspiration for that characteristic of Imprint. (The
    italic F seen in the book is a non-swash design, which I think confirms that this
    book is set in Imprint apart from the descender height, though, so I'm not holding
    out Stephenson Blake Caslon Old Style as another possibility.)
