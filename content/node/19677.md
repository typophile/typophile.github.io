body: "I have been asked to volunteer my time to design the Tulsa AIDS Walk logo.
  I started off by designing a red ribbon to look like the \"T\" in \"Tulsa\". Then,
  I browsed through several bold/black sans serif fonts. I ended up using Myriad Pro
  Black Italic. In order to have the \"ulsa\" at the same angle as the \"T\", I had
  to sheer the type set in Myriad Pro Black Italic by about 22 degrees. I am not an
  advocate of sheering type, but I wasn't sure what else to do. \r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think about the \"ulsa\"?  Now that I have sheered the type, should I adjust the
  shapes of the characters to compensate? Thanks for your input. Should I use a different
  font?\r\n\r\nTy"

  body: "I would look at making the whole word red. I'm reading the ulsa with a ribbon
    in front. If it was all the same color, I believe It would read better for me.\r\n\r\nYou
    could start by righting an ital, and then matching the ribbon/T to the ital without
    sheering it.\r\n\r\nI think the Myriad does the job, but I do wonder about other
    options.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick loose look at Formata.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tulsa_3795.gif]\r\n\r\nBut
    now I've started reading Pulsa. I'm out."

  body: Ty, this is great. I had the same thought as did James. Did you choose this
    burgundy color for a specific reason as opposed to red which is normally associated?
    If you can print the blend -- and it looks good -- I do like the blend as it adds
    depth. However, I would add it to the rest of the letters.

  body: "See \"aids_06.pdf\"\r\n\r\nJames, thanks for suggesting Formata. It lead
    me to find Zwo. I used FF Zwo Black Italic Alt for \"Tulsa\" and FF Zwo Semi Bold
    SC Italic for \"AIDS WALK\". I started seeing \"ulsa\" too, so I made the whole
    thing red. I also took your advice and started with the font rather than the ribbon.
    Do you see \"Pulsa\" now?\r\n\r\nTiffany, the burgandy was supposed to be red.
    I changed it to be more of a true red. I opted against adding depth to the rest
    of the letters because I thought that might confuse the ribbons with the letters.
    Hopefully the word reads well as a whole. \r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions.
    They are much appreciated.\r\n"

  body: "I like the look of this, I would suggest looking at reversing the ribbon
    so the the loop is to the left, which will prevent anyone seeing Pulsa, removing
    or reducing the drop shadow especially on the vertical and horizontal and trying
    the loop the other way around so that the vertical and horizontal are the top
    objects and the loop is at the back (I hope that last point makes some sense).\r\nTim"

  body: "I prefer your latest option simply because the colour* ties it in with the
    rest of the word, allowing the horizontal to be a T, while keeping the ribbon
    apparent. In shearing it you might have to move the AIDS WALK a bit to the right
    to visually align.\r\nGood work, well realised.\r\nTim\r\n*I should say the reduced
    shadow"

    isn't just you, it is looking large, the angle seems to have exaggerated the overshoot.
    I'd try and move down the curve slightly.\r\n\r\nNice work Ty. :^)"

    tifs with an amplified dot pattern that will work as line art.

    say the pulsa myself, until I read what people had said. I would have liked to
    have seen the two steams of the T not have shadows, so the loop is the only thing
    that comes out. My theory on that is, the steams and the \"ulsa\" would look like
    they're on the same plain, therefore should wowrk better, but thats my opinion.\r\nWhatever
    you do I think it works well, and good luck with it.\r\n\r\n-ER  "
