  of mine, but I can't find out which typeface is used for the \"pour les nuls\",
  seems like a serifed Papyrus like font but is it just a logo ? Well is someone has
  a clue, let me know.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pour-les-nuls_6111.jpg]"

    Dolores</a> and you're close.
