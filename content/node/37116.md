body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI searched through the Typophile and found the \"Luxury\"
  font collection by OrangeItalic. I think they are pretty close to what I'm looking
  for. What other fonts do you think exemplify \"luxe.\" \r\n\r\n(And by \"luxe,\"
  I refer to middle-aged/golfer/CEO-with-a-private-jet kind of luxe. Like Trump but
  with more class.)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are truly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
