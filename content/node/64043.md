  DC, and in few weeks, I will be allowed to work in the USA. \r\nSo, I am looking
  for any contact related to graphic/type design studios, galeries, bookshops, or
  foundries in DC area.\r\nI need to know more about graphic design culture here so
  if anybody could help me, I would be pleased.\r\n\r\nI have already had a look on
  this topic:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/31239\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    Design Army, and Grafik.\r\n\r\n<cite>galeries</cite>\r\nNot much for type/design.
    But take advantage of the free art museums on the national mall. Drive (or take
    a train) to Baltimore and see the American visionary museum, the real gem of the
    area.\r\n\r\n<cite>bookshops</cite>\r\nFor a visitor there are no interesting
    bookstores left in the Washington area (especially if you\u2019re used to good
    French bookstores). If you really love American politics you might want to try
    Kramer Books or Politics and Prose. Second Story Books at 22nd and P in NW Washington
    sometimes has good used books at prices far cheaper than most stores, and now
    that I have left town nobody is buying up all his design books.\r\n\r\n<cite>foundries</cite>\r\nThere
    are none.\r\n\r\nYou can try connecting with the <a href=\"http://aigadc.org/\">DC
    AIGA</a>. Business in DC slows almost to a halt between the middle of November
    and the middle of January, so this is a good time to connect with people, but
    make appointments in advance as many people will be on vacation."

    shop and get connected with the design studios.\r\nI am a little bit sad to hear
    that no foundries exist in DC, but I could guess that.\r\n\r\n:-) !"
