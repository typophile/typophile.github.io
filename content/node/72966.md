  body: "Argh! I was so sure it would be a breeze to find this. I've come across this
    before and it's definitely a unique font, I'm 99.9999% certain it's a freebie.
    My instincts took me through the Techno and Basic sections on DaFont, as well
    as to ShyFonts, Iconian Fonts, Pizzadude and Larabie, but to no avail. I'll keep
    looking, but if this helps jogs someone else's memory, then all the better.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
