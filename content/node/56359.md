body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nsorry for maybe asking a quite basic question, i just
  can't find a potent keyword that gets me to the for sure existing answers, so I'm
  asking for a link to other threads or a short explanation ... It should be simple,
  but it just does not work at the moment and I don't know what I am doing wrong.
  :(\r\n\r\n\r\nI try to to a \"multi-step\" one-after-another-replacement with opentype
  (fontlab 5):\r\n\r\nLet's say I have a glyph x.\r\nin calt-feature, i substitute
  x by x.alt\r\nafter that, i want to check another condition, \r\nand in case it
  applies, want to sub x.alt by x.alt2\r\n\r\nis this possible to do?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
  explain what i actually want to achieve with this:\r\ni want to do a script font,
  that has three vertical levels of connectors to the glyph right before it. So i
  have 4 variations of each letter, i.e.   h h.low h.mid h.top \r\ndepentent on its
  predecessors \"end\", the basic \"h\" is replaced by its low mid or top connector
  variant so it fits seamlessly.\r\nafter that, i want to check if the glyph is set
  at the end of a word (followed by a space for the beginning), and if so, the .low
  .mid or .top variant is replaced by a .low.end .mid.end or .top.end variant ...\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your help\r\nSebastian"

    the top to the bottom. So when you have your first lookup for changing x to x.alt1
    , you have to pay attention for your second lookup whether the first condition
    has met, could be met or not. Whether for your second lookup you are dealing with
    x or x.alt1 or both, in order to change it to x.alt2\r\nSo it is important to
    pay attention to the sequence of events and write the lookups accordingly.\r\n\r\nYou
    are right. There are a lot of good discussions about this in here but I don't
    remember the topics off hand. Keep looking. You'll find them."

    connect this thread to the font thread I have just created:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/56408\r\n\r\nmaybe
    it's better to discuss there."

  body: "Sebastian, \r\n\r\nAfter one lookup is processed, the application goes back
    to the beginning of the text string (or better: text run, i.e. the portion of
    the text string which has the same font, size, writing system/script, and directionality),
    and processes the next lookup. So your code should look like: \r\n\r\n<code>feature
    calt { \r\nlookup calt1 { \r\nsub @condition1 x' by x.alt; \r\n} calt;\r\nlookup
    calt2 { \r\nsub @condition2 x.alt' by x.alt2; \r\n} calt2\r\n} calt;</code>\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
