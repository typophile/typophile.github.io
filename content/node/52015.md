body: "CV writing is integral in every person\u2019s dream of climbing the corporate
  ladder, getting that dream job, or applying for a research grant. A CV (<a href=\"http://www.whatisacv.com/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Curriculum Vitae</a>) summarizes a person\u2019s achievements,
  life and work history, and skills related to the position applied to.\r\n\r\nMany
  are confused with a resume and <em>curriculum vitae</em>. Although individuals use
  both documents for application processes, the length and purpose of writing one
  of these vary. Resume writing limits only to one to two pages with bulleted and
  summarized personal, academic, and professional information. On the other hand,
  CV writing requires two to three pages of document, with expounded description of
  one\u2019s achievement.\r\n\r\nCVs represent one\u2019s accomplishments in detail.
  It is vital that the individual writes this document with good quality so the employer
  or academic committee will accept the application. In CV writing, the individual
  is like writing an advertisement in a form of a narrative document. The said document
  is like a brochure that informs target consumers and then persuades them to purchase
  a product or utilize a service.\r\n\r\nCV writing helps an individual promote himself
  or herself by literally describing one\u2019s possessed skills. Nowadays, companies
  and educational institutions not only look for a person\u2019s EQ, IQ, and educational
  background. They also look out for work experiences, social activities, grants,
  publications (if any) and active memberships as well.\r\n\r\nSimilar to resume writing,
  CV writing also includes an individual\u2019s personal information so companies
  and institutions applied to can immediately call him or her for a scheduled meeting
  or interview.\r\n\r\nRemember, CV writing also requires the applicant\u2019s goal
  and objective. If the applicant targets to apply to a different company with the
  same industry, the he or she must highlight those reasons. If the applicant wants
  to qualify for a position in the same company, he or she must write the CV in a
  convincing way. Finally, if the individual has nil background in the industry, he
  or she must present skills and experiences that can be applied in the vacant position.\r\n\r\nA
  CV is like a long personal essay describing one\u2019s self. Similar to resume writing,

  and objective. If the applicant targets to apply to a different company with the

  highlight those valid reasons. If the individual has nil background in the industry,
  then he or she must present skills and experiences that can be applied in the vacant
  position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>MY PROFILE\r\nNancy Baker</strong> is a Recruitment
