body: "I am pleased to announce the opening of my <a href=\"http://www.omine.net/\">personal
  foundry</a>.\r\nThree new typefaces are available for now, exclusively in the OpenType
  format.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<em>The typefaces</em>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.omine.net/maest.htm\">Maest</a>
  is an unusual script typeface constructed with straight lines. It features 4 styles
  of figures (tabular lining, tabular oldstyle, proportional lining, proportional
  oldstyle), swash capitals, ending forms, f-ligatures, and 3 weights (from regular
  to black).\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"http://www.omine.net/bunker.htm\">Bunker</a> is a
  versatile stencil type family with lowercase characters and a extensive character
  set that covers the Latin, Central European, Turkish and Baltic codepages. This
  type family is comprised of 4 interchangeable styles (a character occupies the same
  advance-width in all of the fonts) and features 4 styles of figures.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.omine.net/gotica.htm\">Gotica
  Lumina</a> is a new blackletter. The soft version features gentle contours that
  contains no corners. The sharp version, more suitable for display usage, is more
  rigid and slightly lighter than the soft one. There is an alternate font* for each
  style, and all fonts have 4 styles of figures, standard ligatures and discretionary
  ligatures.\r\n\r\n* The alternate characters are also available in the \"main\"
  font, through the \"salt\" feature, but considering the current general lack of
  support to this specific OpenType feature, alternate fonts have been made available.\r\n\r\n<em>50%
  off until May 31!\r\nPromotional price valid for Gotica Lumina, Bunker and Maest.\r\nCheck
  the prices by following the links above or directly at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/ominetype/\">MyFonts</a>.</em>\r\n"

  body: You know, I'm rewriting my post to say that at first (actually when you mailed
    this to the brazilian typography list) I ended up not paying much attention to
    Lumina (I'm ashamed!). But now that I have actually payed some attention (and
    read the related typophile thread), I think it's wonderful. Congratulations Eduardo!
