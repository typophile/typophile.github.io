body: Is there a generally accepted convention for naming glyphs relegated to the
  Unicode Personal Use Area? I.e., when I automatically generate names in FL, I get
  stuff like &#39;_14&#39; as opposed to &#39;uniF701&#39;. Is that OK, or should
  they be in the form &#39;uniXXX&#39;?

  body: 'Nathan,  <BR> <BR>as the name says, the Priavte Use Area is for private use.
    So there is no, and should be no &#34;generally accepted convention&#34;. I strongly
    advise agains using uniXXXX for PUA.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/unicodegn.jsp#4"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/unicodegn.jsp#4</a> says  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;This specification supports the mapping of glyph names to strings that
    contain private use area scalar values. For example, the names &#34;Ogoneksmall&#34;
    and &#34;uniF6FB&#34; both map to the string U&#43;F6FB. <BR> <BR>This specification
    does not include, imply nor assume any particular usage of the PUA; it merely
    permits to name glyphs such that the restored character strings include PUA code
    points. It is up to the producers and consumers of glyph names to establish an
    agreement on the PUA usage. <BR> <BR>Font designers should note that establishing
    this agreement with users of general purpose fonts can be difficult. It is likely
    that not all tools manipulating character strings built from glyph names will
    correctly implement the PUA usage, and this can lead to incorrect functionality.
    It is therefore recommended, for general purpose fonts, that all glyph names convert
    to strings that do not contain PUA characters.&#34; <BR> <BR>However, <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/unicodegn.jsp#6"
    target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/unicodegn.jsp#6</a> says:
    &#34;For glyphs which do not correspond to any character in the Unicode standard,
    the name will not have any technical usefulness.&#34;  <BR> <BR>The idea behind
    the uniXXXX convention is, among others, that people who use the font can consult
    the Unicode Standard to find out what the particular character &#34;means&#34;.
    For example, uni0105 can be deciphered as &#34;LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH OGONEK&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>Since the Private Use Area mappings do not correspond to characters that are
    permanently encoded in Unicode, it doesn&#39;t make sense to call them uniXXXX,
    since the Unicode standard does not contain any &#34;resolution&#34; on what XXXX
    means in this case. So it&#39;s better to use a meaningful, human-readable name
    such as &#34;arrowup&#34; or &#34;smallbird&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Adam'
