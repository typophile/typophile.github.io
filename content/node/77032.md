body: I have tried identifying the font used here but I find similar fonts that work
  for the numbers except the "4" but don't work for the letters especially the "R".
  This leads me to believe there are two fonts here - one for the letters and one
  for the numbers. Any help is truly appreciated!!![img:sites/default/files/old-images/BanksShapiro_5351.jpg]

    term would be for it, on the lower loop of the C.
