  and keeps us Typophilers endeared to the place. Once we've worked out say, 25 good
  reasons, we can vote for the top ten \"most popular\" ones.\r\n\r\nI wonder if Paul
  Hunt would like to put together one of his polling forms so we can get an accurate
  tally for the top ten?\r\n\r\nI'll start off with a handful of sample reasons:\r\n\r\n*
  It's a rollercoaster ride but it's the best design & visual arts-based rollercoaster
  ride going on the internets. Put money on it. Typophile is the best.\r\n\r\n* It's
  a diverse, dynamic community of mostly open-minded, left-thinking, right-brained
  and uncannily creative visual thinkers and artists unparalleled in their ability
  to explain what typography is all about.\r\n\r\n* Some of the world's best typeface
  designers, typographers, book designers, calligraphers and type engineers are here.
  The amount of talent on tap surprises me daily. (similar to above but slightly different
  reason)\r\n\r\n* We have the most exhaustive and thoroughgoing typo discussions
  & debates in the world, and you can learn more about typography here than you ever
  thought possible.\r\n\r\n* From a technical standpoint Typophile's forum pages are
  the easiest to read on the web (you'd expect that anyway but it's worth stating).\r\n\r\n*
  Typophile is at least as long as it is broad. It's hairy too, in some places some
  of the time. But stick with it, roll with the punches and take it all in good faith,
  and you will see the point with everlasting clarity.\r\n\r\n* It makes me proud
  to be a Typophiler. I'm touched. I'm humbled. I'm impressed. In the future everybody
  will be a type designer for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAny others? There are
  stacks of reasons. Go for it . . .\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    than cherubs and not as nice - or much nicer... I forget.)\r\nNow I know that
    they are the sort of spiky things on Times New Romain that make it different from
    Areal. \r\n\r\n2, As part of my job, over the last few years, I have had the opportunity
    and privilege to study typography and type design quite deeply. And on company
    time! It's been kinda cool. For me at least. My coworkers seemed to think that
    eating glass would have been preferable and were glad is was my burden and not
    theirs, but - That's their problem :o)... Any how, I have found no better source
    of all-round typo-learnin' anywhere. \r\n\r\n3. In my opinion, typefaces & how
    they are generated, rendered, reproduced, read and understood are the nuts and
    bolts of human communication. It is worth knowing about type if you are a designer
    (... or a reader), and it is frankly just very interesting and fun to read some
    the debates that take place about the directions things in typography are going
    in.\r\n\r\n4, I've seen some of the best damned type designers and typographic
    experts you'll find anywhere on the planet answer the most basic questions from
    the the greenest novice in enormous detail and with no hint of condescension.

  body: The Typophile community actually acts like a good, decent community. It's
    like that local historical neighborhood with all the interesting characters who
    live there. To top it off, these characters will invite you, the complete stranger,
    to stop in for the neighborhood BBQ. And the discussions here are, even when completely
    above your understanding, interesting to observe.

    has learned a ton from this site. I've gained some valuable resources, and stimulated
    my brain. What else can you ask from a web-forum?"
