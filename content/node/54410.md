  I did\u2019nt know where the projet would go when I started it, but now it\u2019s
  a real typeface and I want to tell my gratitude to all typophile members who gave
  me their comments or advices all along the process.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Hrant,
  Chris, Mark and Nick on Typophile and also Xavier Dupr\xE9 and Ian Party on Typographe.\r\n\r\nI

    wide in MIGRATION? Especially when it appears with the M and O. No?"

  body: "Not really to my point of view. Read the text below the headline. It's start
    with the word DESIGNER\u2026 and the G fit very well in the text. I know that's
    the small caps but we've made some test also in caps and it gave a nice \xABcolor\xBB
    to the text. Thanks for your question.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
