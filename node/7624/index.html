  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Finally, I got myself together and now I'm posting one of my designs for critique. The story so far: The company &quot;Paldin Holiday&quot; wanted a logo design. They operate a significant number of hotels and resorts. The task was described like this - &quot;we want something that would appeal to rich European customers. We like to show that we have hotels &amp; resorts not only on the Bulgarian Black Sea, but also in the Rhodopes Mountains, various ski resorts &amp; hotels&quot;. PALDIN is an old Roman name for my city, Plovdiv - but wanted me to stay away of the Roman element. That was okay for me, so I did something rather expected: <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53262.gif" alt="Logo 01"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53263.gif" alt="Logo 2"> <BR> <BR>Then, after a month of silence, they appeared and said: &quot;you know what - funny, but the real estate business exploded enormously, so now we're not only build and rent hotels, but also sell appartments. We love what we see so far, but could you incorporate some &quot;real estate&quot; element in the current suggestions. And they look like a travel agency&quot;. I pollitely told them: what do you expect , with HOLIDAY in the company name? Okay I'll see what I can do <BR> <BR>As you all see, those designs wouldn't allow me to add some sort of building, house or similiar symbol. So I started all over again: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53264.gif" alt="Logo BIG"> <BR> <BR>or  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53265.gif" alt="Logo 4"> <BR> <BR>Now I'm wondering, would they understand the last one, the roof shape that's being formed by the 3 squares&hellip; <BR> <BR>I'm open for suggestions &amp; comments. Thanks in advance&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ivan, this is where you need a marketing man to help you explain that you can't stick 10lbs of s_ _ _ _ in a five pound bag. If someone is looking for hotel properties or resort properties they probably aren't looking for real estate as well. I think either two logos will do it or they need to change the name to something that sounds like a holding company like Paldin Inc. The word Holiday looses its meaning.</div>

The logotype clearly states, in writing 'hotels, resorts, real estate' so I think the roof angle, while nice, isn't really necessary&hellip;it's just a nice 'aha!' when you explain it to them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that you are using too many colors on your logotype(4+) and I don't really like the typeface you are using. You should work on the illustrations. I hardly see the mountains and the house looks more like a doggy shack to me. <BR>  Of the variations you gave the one with the circles have most appeal. <BR>  You can also try to make the symbols a bit smaller. <BR>If I am to compare the disigns : the ones that you made a month ago and the recent designs, I would surely choose the recent ones. <BR> <BR>Salute, Ivan <BR>(i uspeh ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everybody, for the feedback. My main concern about the second set of designs is that they may look a bit like and information signs, rather than a logo. I would love to design a wordmark only, and lose all the symbols. But hey - the company I'm working for is not Kioken and we can't afford to &quot;fire clients&quot;, like they did with Sony.  <BR>Galin is right for the colour usage&hellip;I should see how all these symbols would look in a single or 2 colour scheme. <BR>  <BR>Now I'm waiting for them to decide.</div>
