  body: "Lowercase would be interesting, albeit somewhat of an anachronism, as our
    lowercase is \"Holy Roman\" rather than Roman ;-)\r\n\r\nAlthough, the Romans
    only thing Roman's wrote in big, monumental capital letters (like Trajan), were
    big monumental inscriptions. So I think that Trajan is totally inappropriate for
    Latin poetry. The Romans had their own handwriting systems that they would have
    used for things like that. These letters never would have been as \"perfect\"
    as Trajan.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could used something like Trajan, but less perfect\u2026
    like Trajanus or some of Goudy's faces. Although these are probably even more
    anachronistic\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat about Renaissance type, or Italic? During the
    Renaissance, they starting printing all of these texts in Latin again\u2026 Renaissance
    type is as close to \"accurate\" and \"original\" as you might be able to get."
