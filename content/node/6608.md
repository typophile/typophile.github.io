  body: Those links make it seem like Trajan is a linotype font when in fact it&#39;s
    an Adobe Original and one of my all time favorites. It&#39;s probably adobe&#39;s
    fault for not licensing to myfonts.com

  body: It is a beautiful font and I&#39;ve used it a lot but it has become so ubiquitous
    &#40;every other movie poster you see&#41; that I&#39;ve retired it for awhile,
    personally that is.

  body: Another great typeface that is similar to Trajan - Odyssey. I&#39;ve used
    in on a couple projects and it has some very nice alternate swash characters.
