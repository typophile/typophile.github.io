body: Body text font used in the mid 80's polish book. It's so ordinary, but not so
  well printed that I don't have idea what it could be.

  body: Huh, some horrid spacing there. R omanum i m per ar um. This, and the f and
    j looks like compromises made for some primitive photosetter technology that needs
    lots of space between every glyph, so I guess this could be a variation of Times
    (probably under another name) made for that system.
