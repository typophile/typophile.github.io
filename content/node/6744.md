body: Hi, <BR>I am new here, so sorry if this question already has been posted here
  a million times but i didn&#39;t find it after a quick browse through old threads.  <BR>There
  is this font that I&#39;ve seen so many times, and always loved, but didn&#39;t
  know it was out there digitalised. Until a while ago when I saw it at <a href="http://www.graficeurope.com"
  target="_blank">www.graficeurope.com</a> and realised that i probably is! But i
  dont know the name of the font, or where to get it. Does anyone know? <BR>Thanks!

  font is this?">

  body: No, I think this is House Industries&#39; Chalet New York 1960. Try it out
    in their <a href="http://www.houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=lettersetter"
    target="_blank">LetterSetter</a> and you&#39;ll see that it matches &#40;except
    in the sample above, they didn&#39;t use the fi ligature&#41;.

  body: Incidentally, the face you remember from years ago is probably Helvetica in
    the original display cuts, for which the font James linked to is the only digital
    version available. The &#34;1960&#34; cuts of Chalet have a lot of the same look
    and feel.
