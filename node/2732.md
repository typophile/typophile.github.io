  body: It&#39;s a little tricky to say for sure given the low resolution, but it
    looks like <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205302">Monotype

  body: I&#39;m going to guess <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/garamond/mt/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Monotype Garamond</a>, or Linotype <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/garamond-classico/garamondclassico/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Garamond Classico</a>, based on the Q and the closed 4. The sample
    is too small to see enough detail
