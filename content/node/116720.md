body: "I am curious to identify this font which I've found in a book on upholstery.
  \r\n\r\nThe book is called 'Upholstery A Step-by-Step Guide' by Jeanne Argent (Hamlyn
  Publishing Group, 1974 - ISBN 0600381196). The font is used for chapter titles throughout
  the book - the attached image is an example of its use."

  body: "At first this heavy thick and thin with a circa 1900 feel reminded me of
    John F. Cumming's Binner Poster of 1898 http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Binner+Poster&q=Go
    but it's quite different. Perhaps one of the photo-lettering era designers?\r\nStill
    looking.\r\nDon"

  body: I just went through the whole 1980 VGC catalog and it wasn't in there. (most
    earlier VGC fonts would still have been in there).

  body: I went through the 1976 VGC catalog and it is not in it either - it sure looks
    like photo-type but can't find it yet. Also did 70's Letraset and Chartpak catalogs.

  body: Thanks very much. Is it useful if I scan another heading with other letter
    combinations?

  body: "Yes, it would be useful if you scan more. Look forward to seeing whatever
    you can post, if possible including earmark letters like G & Q. Space here is
    free so there is no limit on how many you scan :)\r\nDon"

  body: Good find Don - ATF Florintine Bold Condensed also looks good as a possible
    starting point. URW/SoftMaker has a digital font called Florintine that has some
    glyphs that relate but not all.
