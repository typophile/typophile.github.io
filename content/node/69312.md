  I am wondering if anyone can suggest any digital typefaces that might be similar
  to it. I know only having one letter is not much to go on, but any suggestions would
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handlettered-T_5788.jpg]"
