  body: "If you choose a text font with rounded corners you'll end up with something
    probably too frivolous, as well as pudgy rendering at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an idea: invert the motif and choose a font with rounded <em>insides</em>, which
    is most commonly exhibited in the transition from stems to serifs. So choose a
    font with fully adnate serifs, that come out of the stems in quarter-circles.
    And if it's a slab that would emphasize the effect. This leads me to recommend
    my favorite slab, Egyptian 505:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/egyptian-505/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    in that pointy circle in the logo the transition from curves to lines seems to
    be suffering from the classic \"bone artefact\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
