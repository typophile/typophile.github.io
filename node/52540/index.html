Now and then the odd type designer makes a truly spontaneous display type graphic designers find inspiring & irresistable.

Introducing -----<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jabberwub/">Sentinel Jabberwub</a>-----

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jabberwub_fonta_poster_6525.gif]

============begin news release==============

A fresh new decorative display face bubbling with life & spontaneity, Jabberwub belongs to a rare genus of creature fonts that type forgot—casual animated. A fun & bouncy eye-catcher dancing a whacky line between discord & rhyme, Jabberwub packs tons of fun into a state-of-the-art OpenType font loaded with 270 extra glyphs, including stylistic alternates, discretionary ligatures, word ligatures and capitalized ligatures, allowing creative typographers to achieve a custom hand-lettered look without all the mess & spilt glue of a manual paste-up job.

Jabberwub is ideal for whatever zany stuff springs to mind. It takes an outline with no problem-o, and you can squish & squoosh it as the occasion takes your fancy. Optimal results are achieved by hand setting each individual glyph. Available in OpenType only.

Jabberwub can be viewed and test driven now at Myfonts:

If Stephen Coles or anybody else comes in here and says the position I choose to adopt on this is ridiculous or "just silly", I recommend they talk to Erik Spiekermann or John Collins about why thier companies have these terms and conditions governing site content use on their websites in the first place.

They will have a very hard time trying to prosecute me for violation of the Fanta trademark.

Clue: it's done with permission, and aesthetic license.

You said it was a joke. I only said I like a good joke now and then. This is for real.

Yes, like "a-n"!
But don't worry, I suspect that people are aware script is a more personal expression than type, done with aesthetic licence, and employ "reading licence", turning up the readerability knob a notch and enjoying the mayhem. Or maybe script plays up the game-like, puzzle-solving dimension of reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I ain't worryin'. And yes I think you're ryte as usual, script lettering is a personal expressiveness type of thing. In effect I'm scaling the edge of readerability / readability while firing a shot into the trademark maelstrom to see what happens there.

I always do research before deciding on a retail font's name, to find out how widespread prior use (if any exists) of the name has been in the public domain. A google search of "fonta" turns up soome fascinating prior uses of it as a trademark, none of them registered. So the Coke peeple, if they ever bother hassling me about this) will have to admit widespread prior use of the letter string "fonta" by numerous companies and private individuals, whose use of "fonta" as a business name / brand has not diluted Coke's registered Fanta trademark. If Coke go for similar wordmark conflict, well, we'll see about that. Their claim would have to include an argument for dilution of the Fanta wordmark, and that could take a long time to hammer out out-of-court. Meantime I get a free ride with my Fonta mark acting as the pivot for the Jabberwub branding communications scheme.

For readers interested in prior use of "Fonta", here are some relevant links:

I'm forcing type users to reassess what they think they know. That's our job as type designers. I want the world guessing where the truth begins.
