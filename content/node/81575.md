body: Has anyone read anything on the topic of the use of font in picturebooks? Is
  there any literature about using typography in children's literature? I am looking
  for non-academic or non-education related pieces about this. There is something
  THERE when you look at children's picturebooks. The fonts are well done (mostly)
  and fit the theme and motif of the books in a lot of cases.
