  and that means for you and me lots of goodies:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dardenstudio.com/\r\n\r\nThe
  free font Birra Stout (Birra is eyetalian for beer) is super chunky and cute, tho
  I\u2019m pretty Nick Curtis would roll his eyes\u2014it\u2019s more his thing :oP\r\nhttps://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/birra_stout\r\n\r\nFreight
  is now in OpenType Std form for only slightly more, tho I\u2019m not sure of all
  those nifty features are integrated and contextual :\r\nhttps://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_text\r\n\r\nThe
  Untitled face that won a TDC award in 2007 has been released as Jubilat. Its available
  in OpenType Pro too: \r\nhttps://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/jubilat\r\n\r\nThere
  are other gems all over his page:\r\n\r\nThis italic seems like an extension Corundum,
  but notice the gothic with the funky number eight... I need that!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/checkoutthateight_4381.png]\r\n\r\nRead
  the blog. There are plenty of previews of coming attractions. Corundum News and
  a commissioned face for Mucca\u2019s rebranding of Canton Liqueur. There are some
  interesting designs in the tshirts section:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/katie_3482.png]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dardenstudio.com/notes/\r\nhttp://www.dardenstudio.com/shirts/\r\n\r\nThere
  is an in-house branding technical sans that I really like. Argent? Notice the capital
  R:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/niceR_4922.png]\r\nI spied that in the
  Birra PDF specimen.\r\n\r\nI am truly impressed Mr. Darden versatility as a type
  designer... the next Matthew Carter?\r\n\r\n******************************\r\n\r\nBut
  lets no forget our friend halfway around the world\u2014PampaType released Garrone:\r\nhttp://www.pampatype.com/php/2008/Tipografias_GR.php?secc=cara&menu=menu_T_C.html&sub1=sub1_T_GR_C.html&sub2=sub2_T_G_C.html&pag=pag_T_GR_C.html\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to take the best qualities of Rayuela Chocolate and Alrt and transform them
  into something exciting and expressive, yet still entirely suitable for serious
  book/text work and related to his other productions. Yummy!\r\n\r\nEnjoy and happy
  font shopping... next payday I promise!!!!!\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the alert, MIke. Darden's new site and fonts are stellar. His background
    and influences are pretty clear and he executes his own take in fine fashion.
