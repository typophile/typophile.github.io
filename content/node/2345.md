  body: For the 80s, I&#39;d go with Serif Gothic and Helvetica as prime choices.
    <BR> <BR>For the 90s, it&#39;s all about Emigre, either Matrix or one of the other
    totally ubiquitous designs they created. <BR> <BR>For the 00&#39;s, how can you
    go wrong with Crackhouse from House Industries? That was everywhere!

    of good retro fonts... grunge/punk, street rod, Latin American, etc. <BR> <BR><a
    href="typography.com">Hoefler</a>&#39;s stuff is almost all inspired by old metal
    type, although it is a bit mainstream now thanks to all their awesome commissions.
