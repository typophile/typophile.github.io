  Does anyone have any suggestions? I've attached a pic of some hand lettering I found
  in a '70s copy of playboy (massive apologies for the blurry picture!), its great
  but I've never seen a typeface like it anywhere. I'm about to start a series of
  greetings cards and would love to use a typeface similar to this.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  knows of any faces like it I would love to hear their suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJono

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nCabernet on 'A bevy of balls' is almost sexual. I want it!
    The \xA365 price tag might put it out of my reach until I'm no longer a student
    with more pressing bills to pay. Carousel is affordable though so might be my
    answer. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nJono"
