body: "***WARNING- NOT TYPOGRAPHICALLY RELEVANT***\r\n\r\nHi guys:\r\n\r\nI recently
  had the misfortune of having to go to Los Angeles County General Hospital. For those
  of you who don't know, General Hospital is a huge understaffed facility catering
  to low income or poor individuals. Urgent Care (a faster emergency service) nor
  any of the clinics I usually use were not an option. Having had literally been beaten
  up side my head I already knew I needed a Cat Scan of my head. Not equipment found
  in a clinic.\r\n\r\nI got there at 3:30pm and registered. 20mins later a nurse calls
  me into an examining clinic (there is a cursory examination to see how sick you
  really are- if you can wait, you wait, if your case is more serious, you're whisked
  off to the Intensive Care Unit). My situation was not critical. I get checked out
  by the nurse and she tells me I need to be seen by the doctor. \r\n\r\nBut before
  I see the doctor I have to speak to the insurance lady. I get called for her at
  around 5:00pm. I give her my insurance card. I'm covered. Mind you there are 12
  windows but there are only 4 or 5 insurance people on hand behind those windows.\r\n\r\nThen
  I wait. And I wait. For all the contempt I here regarding County Hospital being
  over-flowing with people, the amount of people actually looks like any other emergency
  room I've been to.\r\n\r\nI get seen by a doctor at 11:30pm. My total chat with
  the doctor lasted at the most 4 mins. I was sent to another floor to get the CT
  scan I needed. I waited for that service for about 1\xBD hours. \r\n\r\nDuring the
  wait I began to chat with a nurse about the hospital wait. He told me that actually
  I was fortunate because tonight was a \"slow\" night. And not too many people were
  in the the ICU today. He told me something interesting tho: at night they cut the
  amount of doctors even further down. And I think on the weekends they close one
  of the emergency rooms down. There are three. I'm thinking in my head: \"LA's population
  is going up, not down\". He said they have decent funding now (referring to story
  that broke many years ago of how they actually considering closing the hospital).
  I asked him why cutbacks in the evening or weekends? He said the doctors are too
  expensive so they have cutbacks. Interestingly he told me the board of directors
  get bonuses every year but nurses and doctors get raises every once and a blue moon-
  after they picket of course.\r\n\r\nThe scan was no more than 2\xBD mins. Then back
  to the waiting room on the ground floor. I waited till 3:00am for the doctor to
  tell me everything was okay even though I felt pretty lousy. I was glad anyway.
  I was released.\r\n\r\nI've had Kaiser and Blue Cross (types of decent medical insurance)
  and I've had emergency service in their respective private hospitals and disturbingly
  a 7 to 12 hour wait is about right. So I don't feel too bad after having been to
  County.\r\n\r\nWhat's it like in Canada, England, Germany, Netherlands etc? Do you
  guys have to go though a bunch of hoops to the get care you need. Does it take forever
  like here in the States?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Hey\r\n\r\nI've been living in NYC for 10 years, then in Tokyo, Paris and
    Istanbul, and despite what some might think, every country I've spent some time
    in is far better than the USA when it comes to medical care, not to mention emergency
    units. I was lucky enough not to personally experience any emergency problem while
    I was in NYC, but once my family visited me and my little niece (6 yo at that
    time) suffered high fever in the middle of the night. I took her to a private
    clinic uptown and I've been waiting there for 3 hours, for it was a very slow
    night. I was amazed. Why? Because in France I've never waited more than 20 minutes,
    even for a broken finger. Last year in Istanbul, I had a serious boat accident
    and broke my scapula. 40 people were injured in that accident, so imagine, 40
    people rushing in the hospital et the same time, and it was a public turkish hospital,
    already full of people. I was not one of the most seriously injured, some people's
    faces were litterally ripped off and so on. But nobody waited more then 30 minutes.
    And at that time I had no insurance at all, not even an ID on me, nothing. In
    the USA, in that situation, they would probably come to me after a 9 hours wait
    and tell me to go away. But there, Some guy came, made me every exam (rontgen,
    doctor's exam, etc), gave me medicine and a prescription, and a doctor even wrote
    me instantly a paper not to go to my work for some weeks. All within one hour
    after my arrival. I didnt pay anything at all. 6 month later I had a bad cut on
    the neck and needed a laser surgery not to bleed to death. I've been to a german
    private hospital, paid 100 us$, waited 6 minutes and got my stitching, without
    any insurance etc. I now have the insurance, but believe me, it makes you think.\r\n\r\nI
    can only strongly encourage you to watch Sicko by Michael Moore. As usal He goes
    a little bit far in order to push his speech in the right direction, but it is
    definitely worth watching - and quite creepy.\r\n\r\nMy advice: move.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: In Belgium you just walk into the emergency room and they take good care of
    you. In fact, a lot of people who should just see a doctor (their condition is
    not an emergency) go to the emergency room instead, because the service is faster
    and it's convenient (no appointments, always open, ...). The government is trying
    to remedy that by charging a certain sum if you just walk into the emergency room
    with a slight cough. Anyone else basically gets free treatment.

  body: "In Canada there can be long waits in the emergency room depending on what
    you go in for and the seriousness of the other patients. The longest I've have
    to wait was an hour though - for 8 stitches on the back of my head and it was
    in the middle of the day. People who got to go in front of me included women giving
    birth, broken leg and man with a ring stuck on his finger. \r\n\r\nThere was very
    little paperwork involved though. Since I live in another province than the one
    I hold a health care card in, I had to sign something stating I wasn't lieing
    about the health card being real. But thats it. \r\n\r\nThe second time I went
    to the ER was after coming home from the Caribbean sans a wallet(stolen near Haiti),
    so I had nothing except my passport and I think there was even less paperwork
    that time.\r\n\r\nMost care is free, except for chiropractic stuff and you have
    to pay $40 for an ambulance. We have to pay for eye exams now too but it's a flat
    rate of $75. Here our health care plans basically only cover the cost of prescription
    drugs, dental work and some eye glasses.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Coverage in Canada actually varies by a great degree in every province. For
    instance an ambulance ride in New Brunswick will cost you $180, or it used to
    a few years back. Eye exams are sometimes covered by private health insurance,
    or you pay whatever the optometrist charges per hour/service. Quebec plays by
    its own set of rules when it comes to out of province health care, wether you're
    in Quebec form another province, or a Quebecois in another province. \r\n\r\nFor
    instance in the Northwest Territories, any long-term medication is covered by
    the government, once you fill out the paper work. So is any drug that is needed
    to treat an illness related to the one your currently using medication for. Example,
    if you're asthmatic, your puffers are free, if you develop an illness that's related
    to your asthma the drugs used to treat that are covered as well.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    there is very little bureaucracy involved in being admitted. Everyone does, or
    should have, a provincial/territorial health card that is plug into a database.
    A quick search pulls up the information, they ask what the emergency is, and you
    have a seat and wait. I've had 0 minute wait time for a spinal injury, to 5 hours
    for a dislocated bone on my foot, which they didn't even set, just told me it
    wasn't broken and sent me home.\r\n\r\nAlso, depending on your private coverage,
    you can be covered for everything to nothing. My current plan only covers minor
    dental work, such as cleanings/fillings/removal. I had a plan several years ago
    that covered 85% of my dental/drug/eye care and covered partial costs for other
    things, such as laser eye surgery. It also covered me if i was traveling outside
    the country, all in all the best plan I've had, and from what i hear one of the
    most extensive most employers offer."
