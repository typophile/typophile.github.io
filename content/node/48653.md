  didn't think this would actually work as a font because it was drawn in an outline
  and overlapping the letters was impossible in font format, but then I discovered
  that if I removed the outline the letters could be pushed together and a background
  layered behind it. It's fun playing with colors. It may all be too much? The counters
  too thin?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grafiti_slab_3496.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grafiti_slab_two_5920.jpg]\r\n\r\n-Jess\r\nbvfonts.com"

  body: 'Very nice addition to the soft fonts list. It has needed a slab and now it
    has that. So you say it will have different layers? I really like the idea of
    that as well. Seems to have a nice combination of urban graffiti style and an
    old sign painter at the same time. '

    might round the bottom of the tail on the Q, though...or make it end like the
    tail of the p. Just something odd about it being so sharp.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: "The tiny counters place a limit on how small this font will render successfully.
    Look at Ray's Tank. When he made that one he decided to make a sister version
    with slightly larger counters for small sizes.\r\n\r\nIt works with the outline
    treatments but in plain guise it suffers from a clagged appearance. Rather than
    making two versions with different counter sizes, I would make just one version
    that scales better down to small sizes. \r\n\r\nThe lower <strong>w</strong> is
    letting the side down, sorely in need of integration. Square up the vertices like
    the <strong>v</strong>. I love the oddball <strong>g</strong> and think you should
    exaggerate it even more. Make a quartet of alternate oddball <strong>g</strong>'s
    just like that one only four variations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q</strong> tail fits in
    just fine. <strong>t</strong> is interesting but have another go at it. I sort
    of want to like it, but I can't ;^)\r\n\r\nKeep it on the stove. Adorn it with
    squirrels. Kidding.\r\n\r\nMake an inline version! Yeah, make an inline. Think
    of the Starlet potential. Textured fonts sell; if enuff of us make inline fonts
    they will be the next big thing on the <em>Mefonts</em> Starlets chart. I think
    they should remoniker the reborn <em>Myfonts</em> site <em>Mefonts</em>.\r\n\r\nIn
    several ways it's like some of the A & S Sign font artbrush jobs, the hand-painted
    romans. Look at Bone Casual, Pen & Ink Roman, Porkchop bold. \r\n\r\nAnd it's
    a bit House.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    be good to include a version without that thin internal line."

  body: "Tiffany, Thanks, yes there will be layers, mostly for the back outline. Possibly
    even highlights.\r\n\r\nJT, Thanks, I agree something needs to be done to the
    Q\r\n\r\nMichael, Thanks! \r\n\r\nJames, I think you've convinced me to increase
    the counter space. The w has been changed, I agree. The t is fussy, everything
    else I tried seemed out of place, I'll give it another go. A bit House? If you
    mean finely crafted then I agree, hehe.\r\n"

    pop. I am also seconding some more <strong>g</strong> variations! Nice work.
