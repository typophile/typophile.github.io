    to figure out what a \"protoglyph\" is. a glyph is a symbol with meaning, of course,
    according to our very own typowiki. and proto- is a prefix meaning first, earliest,
    or original. furthermore, in combination with other words, it means - more or
    less - a foundation or basis for things which come after it or develop from it.
    e.g., prototype, protolanguage, etc.\r\n\r\nare you thinking your inadvertant
    squiggle has a universality or flexibility to be the basis for a whole - ahem
    - \"set\" of glyphs?\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n"

    based upon, or derived from this scribble.\r\n\r\nTo use the term \u201Cprotoglyph\u201D
    Hrant has not casually tossed this word in. It is there for a reason, so ignore
    the picture and concentrate upon the word.\r\n\r\nHere's a term that may clear
    up my ramble, think about it.\r\n- ProtoType\r\n\r\nOho ! Something just occured
    to me. Left of normal thinking but not inconceivable. With a more complex \u201Cprotoglyph\u201D,
    it would be possible to have a font of one (1) glyph, where all characters are
    taken from using mathematical formula to extract from that single glyph all information
    to make and display each and every other glyph imaginable.\r\nAlternately that
    single glyph cell could be made up of a grid of unconnected points where using
    same system as before, all characters and glyphs could be determined from.\r\n\r\nWow,

      serial numbers on helicopters and other hardware.  they used a rather crazy
      looking stencil that had multiple facets capable of generating any letter or
      number.  it was an awkward thing; it had to be turned and flipped several times
      for some characters.  the resulting "font" was funny in a strictly utilitarian
      kind of way...  with variations minimized by guidelines but inevitable according
      to who wielded the tool.  i'll try to find an image of the thing.

    to reveal what <cite>I</cite> was thinking, even though it's pretty boring compared
    to the previous flotsam and jetsam of the human psyche...\r\n\r\nNot too long
    ago, in a thread as close as a few clicks away, there was (yet another) \"discussion\"
    about chirography and its [de]merits. I had made a distinction between painting
    and drawing, claiming that the former forms the bodies of shapes (and hence can't
    make ideal notan) while the latter forms the boundaries of shapes (hence has a
    qualitatively better chance). Well, looking that that protoglyph (which I still
    think is a useful term) it struck me that you can actually draw a boundary chirographically!
    Which is not to say it's practical and fruitful to do so. One clue that it isn't
    is that absolutely nobody does that. And one great reason not to is that the topology
    of the glyph (in fact that 8 - yes, all I was seeing was a boring numeral) might
    make it non-sensical, since you can't have crossing outlines. You can make an
    \"o\" for example, but to make a decent \"x\" you'd need to go around in a contortive
    way (although what else is new about chirography :-). Anyway, even though I think
    it's unworkable it might still result in interesting experiments and extrapolations,
    so have fun with the idea if you like.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    this idea along. First there's the issue of: what's the difference between this
    and drawing? I would say that drawing is slow, iterative, vague and deliberate,
    while this exhibits a true chirographic essence in its flow and certainty. As
    for the difference between conventional chirography and this, perhaps the best
    thing I can point to is the way stroke contrast is distributed: in chirography
    it results from the nature of the [virtual] tool, while in this method it results
    from an abstract decision on the part of the maker; if you look at that protoglyph,
    any part of it (I mean the black/body) can be any thickness*, determined only
    by the \"whim\" of the designer - something it shares with drawing. But again,
    it's different than drawing because the organicity of chirography is there. I
    dunno, does that help?\r\n\r\n* Specifically in my proto-8 the left of the head
    loop and the base of the bottom loop are heaviest, which is not something natural
    to conventional chirography. Now, this weighting was not intentional, but it could
    (and -probably- should) be.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of Arnold van Gennep, Victor Turner, and others. In these theories, a ritual,
    especially a rite of passage, involves some change to the participants, especially
    their social status.\r\nThe liminal state is characterized by ambiguity, openness,
    and indeterminacy. One's sense of identity dissolves to some extent, bringing
    about disorientation. Liminality is a period of transition, during which your
    normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are relaxed, opening
    the way to something new.\r\nPeople, places, or things may not complete a transition,
    or a transition between two states may not be fully possible. Those who remain
    in a state between two other states may become permanently liminal.\" </cite>\r\n\r\nI
    am suggesting this because the process I am seeing & hearing you think about seems
    all about process, looking for new methods as in 'technique', but also of thought,

    closer to what you are describing, i.e. letters in a spatial relationship which
    is not optimal for individual letter recognition but is better for multi-letter

    to me something else, i.e. somehow undermining legibility at the letter design
    level in favour of readability, which makes no sense to me. I am perfectly willing
    to accept that the way in which we perceive letters during immersive reading is
    different from how we perceive letters in isolation, and that units of recognition
    in immersive reading may be other than individual letters. But I don't think it
    follows at all that this either requires or benefits from letters being other
    than what they are. Again, I think Hrant is confusing categories by treating perceptions
    of things (boumas) as if they were things perceived (letters, whether individually
    or as feature patterns on a spatial grid). A bouma is a perception of letters,
    so it doesn't make any sense to say that boumas benefit from letters being less
    than letters, and more than it makes sense to say that face recognition benefits

    \"white\" like the opening in the bottom of the lc \"e\". Also a word space is
    a feature of a text an quite an important one. Moreover it isn't it the case that
    we simply tally up features and identify a letter. We look for those features
    to exist in an recognized order or structure which involves both figure and ground
    at once. To use the face analogy - neither the eyes nor the mouth can be in the
    middle. And this again means that it isn't the feature but it's presence in a
    \"correct\" context that allows letter recognition to occur. I don't think that

    optimizing notan and evenness of white space is nearly as important or primary
    as I once did. I think making sure the feature set is obvious enough, and arranged
    well enough to support rapid letter recognition is actually the 1st consideration
    (letter level legibility). Once you have that then it is worthwhile to think about
    the harmony of the features, spacing in words, between words, lines, and ultimately

    you are mistaken. :)\r\n\r\nEben mentioned spacing and kerning, which is the context
    in which one might think the whites and their relationships are most critical.
    But of course this is typically a secondary process after the letters have been
    drawn, during which initial process the internal whites have been defined primarily
    relative to the black <em>not relative to other whites.</em> Usually, there is
    an early stage in the design when one is testing a small number of trial letters
    in word or pseudo-word settings, but then pretty much everyone seems to jump straight
    into \u2018filling out the glyph set\u2019 and only returns to word settings in
    any systematic way at the kerning stage. And what is happening during kerning?
    One way to think about it is certainly in terms of balancing the whites, but if
    that were the case -- or all of the case -- then autospacing would be a breeze.
    It isn't a breeze because letter shape intrudes on the relationship of the whites.
    So I'm inclined to think of spacing and kerning in terms of grid arrangement,
    in which the relationship of the whites is one part but again secondary to the
    relationship of letter features, which need to remain independently legible. This
    is why I am not wholly convinced by David Kindersley's assertion that spacing
    should override letter distinction, even if this means allowing letters to overlap,
    and I think his illustration of this principle uses very carefully selected letterforms
    to make the argument more convincing than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid
    I don't know what you mean by <em>see</em> -- presumably the italics indicate
    something like \u2018really see\u2019 or \u2018see in some way other than normal
    people see\u2019. Sometimes, when designing letters I think to myself \u2018That's
    a nice counter shape\u2019, but only after I've determined that the black is doing
    its job. Everyone sees the whites, and without seeing the whites we couldn't see
    the blacks, but that doesn't mean that the whites are featural. It is interesting
    that the bubble test -- sorry I don't have the paper reference handy; I know we've
    talked about it in another thread -- led to the identification of letter features
    necessary for recognition <em>and that all those features were parts of the figure

    my experience there is definitely a \"learning to see\" experience, but it is
    hard to pin down exactly what one is learning to see. The \"learning to see\"
    is definitely a matter of learning how to evaluate letters in the presence of
    other letters, particularly in words. Basically it is a matter of what design
    of the letter best makes words \"come together\" as a gestalt. \r\n\r\nThe whites
    may be a big part of this, but the fundamental experience is one of sensing visually
    rightness or wrongness in the presence of other letters, and analysis is secondary.
    When I analyze what might be changed to make a letter better I personally try
    to look at everything: weight of black strokes at different angles, relationship
    of terminals, letter widths, curves, stroke contrast, and size, harmony and vibrancy
    of the whites. But when it works it works, and when it doesn't it doesn't. So
    the analysis is sort of feeling your way to a solution, but claims about what
    is most important are always a little suspect, because all the factors interact,
    and nobody really knows. \r\n\r\nI do agree with Chris that the relationship of
    whites is also important in serif faces. I just noticed that its importance is

    I've found that I have indeed been learning to \"switch\" my vision around in
    the design process, i.e. trying to perceive the white as figure and the black
    as ground*; this has actually been very illuminating and has, I think, given me
    better results. Among other things, it has also led to a minor spacing epiphany.\r\n(*
    Inverting the screen and zooming in on countershapes is a nice crutch to make
    this work better.)\r\nHowever, I'm not sure type design education has directly
    helped me with this\u2026 I'm not sure generally how far one can be *taught* to
    <em>see</em> something \u2013 doesn't one inherently have to discover it oneself,
    actively, because one is looking to see it?"

    rendering of outlines; sort of how chirographers think of the black, but applied
    to the outline (which has no thickness). One thing to look for is \"funny\" crossings
    of outlines (and not the sort that happens when you're marking the black - like
    the \"o\" in Peter's example).\r\n\r\nBut more potential examples would be great.

    Michael's point that writing outlines of letters, i.e. suggesting structures by
    visualising the edges of stems instead of stroking them, is an old method that
    is familiar to anyone who has studied formal lettering. At the same time, within
    the varieties of forms producible by this method, there are distinctions to be
    made, as in stroked letters, between formal, constructed letters and informal,
    cursive letters, and Hrant is talking about the latter. Now, given that distinction,
    which requires one to look at how a thing is made as well as what it looks like,
    I'd say that Peter's Helmut Salden example, despite its flamboyance, is actually
    an example of the formal, constructed letter and hence, as Michael, says exactly
    the same sort of beast as the traditional versal letter. Okano's Quintet, on the
    other hand, is clearly distinct in that the outline is cursive. I do think Hrant
    is getting a little over excited, but that's his wont. :)"
