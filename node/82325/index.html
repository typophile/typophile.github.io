  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find a thread for this, although I am quite happy to be re-directed and shouted at if this has already been discussed. I was wondering what people&rsquo;s views are on the idea of typography as an art form. I read a quote (and it&rsquo;s a commonly held belief) that typography is best when it functions without being noticed. If this is the case, is Typography art? Or is it merely functional? I look forward to a debate/being shown where to go to debate this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

criteria differ from person to person. It can be as broad as</p>
<p>&ldquo;The classification of art can be applied by the author or viewer past or present - any object or concept could be labeled art long as anyone anytime believe it so&rdquo;</p>
<p>or as narrow as

Of course at the same time, Art can repurpose any other discipline, and typography can be seen as art by typographers.

<p>I consider crafts to be activities which require a specialized skills&ndash;such as basketweaving or macramé&ndash;which can, at times, produce objects of great beauty as well as utility.

<p>Disagree. Of course typography is supposed to be noticed. But in a manner similar to a movie set: it&rsquo;s not the focus of the scene, but it enhances what&rsquo;s happening in the foreground. And if it&rsquo;s poorly made or inapt, you&rsquo;ll definitely notice.</p>
<p>The idea that &ldquo;printing should be invisible&rdquo; is most directly traceable to Beatrice Warde&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crystal Goblet&rdquo; essay from 1955. While the essay has a few good points to make, its core premise — that &ldquo;invisibility&rdquo; is the defining virtue of typography — is flat wrong. (Wrong on metaphorical grounds too: go to a decent wine bar and you&rsquo;ll see crystal goblets of different shapes being used for different kinds of wine.) It&rsquo;s long past time for typographers, and typographic educators especially, to pour concrete into Warde&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goblet&rdquo; and toss it overboard.</p>
<p>Some defend Warde by saying that her thesis was not so extreme — that she only meant that typography should be suited to the text. A fine idea, but what part of Warde&rsquo;s essay supports this interpretation? If anything, she goes out of her way to reinforce the &ldquo;invisibility&rdquo; theme:</p>
<p><cite>But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice. It is the transparent goblet again! I need not warn you that if you begin listening to the inflections and speaking rhythms of a voice from a platform, you are falling asleep.</cite></p>
<p>Does this statement make any sense at all?</p>
<p>Warde&rsquo;s essay mostly illustrates the perils of latching onto an appealing but inapt metaphor: everything you deduce from that metaphor will also be wrong.</p>

Yes, &ldquo;go to a decent wine bar and you&rsquo;ll see crystal goblets of different shapes being used for different kinds of wine,&rdquo; but you won&rsquo;t find intricately decorated gold chalices, which was the alternative to crystal with which she opened the essay. I would only say that perhaps using &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; might have made her case more compelling. Transparent is, after all, what a crystal goblet is—so my criticism would be that her conclusions were poorly worded, but her metaphor actually spot-on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think the art/not art question is particularly relevant to typography.</p>
<p>Type design is more like Critical Design (as described by Rick Poynor), certainly in the respect that a lot of retail fonts are created not according to a client&rsquo;s design brief, but address issues which the designer finds significant.</p>
<p>Typefaces operate on many levels.
The three main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>as tools for typographer, graphic designers and art directors to make documents with</li>
<li>providing the visual substance for readers of such documents</li>
<li>as cultural subject matter</li>
</ul>
<p>This last aspect: it&rsquo;s possible to consider typefaces independently of either using them to create a document, or reading them as part of a document. Several of the typefaces &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; by MoMA are like that. Beowolf, for instance, is almost never seen in commercial work and very few typographers have actually worked with it, yet it is quite significant in the sphere of type and design culture.</p>
<p>All of us here are acquainted with faces which we have not used and have not seen used commercially, only in showings provided by foundries and distributors, and perhaps discussed in trade media and online blogs and forums.</p>
<p>I often kid myself that my real work concerns not fonts, but type specimens, for these are its core substance, where the full scope of typefaces is displayed, and where their deep meaning resides. My library of specimens is a great collection, encompassing vast realms of history and technology, and many of the specimens are exquisite objects, some of which are literature in that special concrete poetry sub-genre.</p>
<p>When I create a specimen for my type designs, I work to perfect the specimen by perfecting the fonts (or is it vice versa?)—that&rsquo;s as far as I can go. Then it&rsquo;s up to those who license the fonts to add another layer of meaning, and surprise me by revealing qualities in them, and uses, which I would never have expected.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Typography is what it is.  You may choose to define it as simply any use of type and let the qualitative aspect of how well it was done determine for your own set of values if it is &ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo; to be called art.  You may also, if you wish, change that name to &ldquo;typesetting&rdquo; and elevate &ldquo;typography&rdquo; to a particular set of the category &ldquo;typesetting&rdquo; that some people deem as so noteworthy in use and design as to elevate it to an art form.  Typically,this sort of thing is determined differently depending on point of view.  A Job-shop typesetter from the 1950s who makes a living setting type may choose to call himself a craftsman.  A distinguished University professor of design or typography may elevate the term to something higher.  A typical reader may not care a hoot about the distinction and just read the words. People anoint saints for their own reasons.  The people who may have been given that distinction at some point after their death, have just done whatever they seemed fit to do without posing the question at all.</p>
<p>I must admit that I do not see Warde&rsquo;s Crystal Goblet analogy as either correct or at best incomplete.  I am in the middle of writing something on this so I will present that viewpoint later when finished.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To take it back to the OP&rsquo;s question — &ldquo;is typography art?&rdquo; The question is flawed because it presents a false dilemma: either typography is art, or it&rsquo;s &ldquo;merely functional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Typography is a medium with expressive capacity. Any medium with expressive capacity also has the capacity for art. Many expressive media started in functional roles. As the medium branches into more purely expressive uses, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily leave the functional role behind.</p>
<p>For instance, photography. If I said to you &ldquo;is photography art?&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d probably say &ldquo;which photograph are you talking about?&rdquo; A product photo in an Ikea catalog? You&rsquo;d probably say no, it&rsquo;s not art. A Cindy Sherman self-portrait? You&rsquo;d probably say yes. A Richard Avedon fashion photo? Hm, could go either way.</p>
<p>But whether one thinks Ikea vs. Cindy Sherman vs. Richard Avedon deserve to be rated differently is not the point. The point is only that there&rsquo;s nothing preventing typography from being an art medium.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we see more art typography? It&rsquo;s mostly a practical issue: typography is usually in service of a text, which takes center stage, so the expressive possibilities of the typography are always taking a back seat. Out in the real world, most typography is filling a functional role, not an artistic role. But if you look at the work of Jenny Holzer, Marian Bantjes, Erik &amp; Just, Rudy &amp; Zuzana (&amp; many others) I think you&rsquo;ll find plenty of material that qualifies as both typography and art.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m in a minority on this, but I don&rsquo;t think it is belittling typography to say it has a functional component. I find it much more interesting seeing what can be done within functional constraints.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here we go again. I won&rsquo;t retread every path I’ve taken in previous discussions, but I will make a couple of points in brief:</p>
<p>For a very long time, the words art and craft &ndash; or their equivalent in other languages &ndash; were used interchangeably or, rhetorically, to reinforce: ‘in my craft or sullen art’, as Dylan Thomas had it. The word art ultimately implies skilled making, the root of artifice and artefact. Personally, I’m pretty content with this ancient usage, and don’t feel the need to entangle myself in aesthetic theories of expression and response that have to do more with the psychology of the artist and the viewer than with the made thing. The made thing has always seemed more important to me than the thought and emotion that resulted in it or the thought and emotion that is brought to it.</p>
<p><em>If,</em> on the other hand, one desperately wants to make a distinction between craft and art, then I think the objective ground to do so is in terms of art as an extra-utile quality of the made thing, i.e. that which makes it not merely functional. From this, as I’ve expounded before, flows the observation that almost every human-made thing displays some quality of art, some aspect that a) is other than it might have been (i.e. form not determined strictly by function), and b) is consciously formed to aesthetic purpose (accident or randomness can produce things that are beautiful, moving, inspiring, etc. but it isn’t art any more than a rock pleasingly shaped by the tides is art). All other grounds of distinction seem to end up in judicial debates that seem to me less about what is and isn’t art and more about what is good and bad art.</p>
<p>But most of the time, I’m content to think of type design as my craft or sullen art.</p>

If you see typography in a language and script that is completely foreign to you, it is doubtful that it would completely function as intended in your case. But because it does not function as intended for you, does that mean it is either not good typography, not aesthetically pleasing, or not art?</div>

Otherwise, it sounds a bit precious when used in context of digital technology. These days one is most likely to come across the term in the context of ‘artisan cheeses’ or ‘artisan breads’, or people who make e.g. custom shoes or gloves: all of which are very fine things, but not something with which I feel much affinity when producing a font that is going to ship with some hundreds of millions of copies of Microsoft Windows.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I think I was misunderstanding the current usage of &ldquo;artisan&rdquo;, which is indeed as you say, emphasizing manual labor. Creating type faces is undoubtedly design, as Chris says, and as common usage has it—&ldquo;type designer.&rdquo; So the question of how much type design is art is a question of how much design is art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Design&rdquo; does imply creating a template from which many instances are produced, as you say. This is as contrasted with a one-off, unique product. [[http://jameskrenov.com/furniture.htm|James Krenoff]], a furniture maker I greatly admire, emphasized this difference. He kept huge slabs of wood in his shop, planed them, and examined the grain until he was inspired to make a particular piece bringing out and taking advantage of the beauty of that particular piece of wood. He wanted the piece to show that it was from a particular tree, and from a particular hand. He called himself an artisan, and consciously tried to provide his customers with a piece of furniture that would not be experienced as designed and manufactured, but as one-off and personal. Many, me included, would say his pieces are also works of art.</p>
<p>I just consulted one of my favorite reference books as a writer, [[http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Webster-Dictionary-Synonyms/dp/0877793417|The Merriam Webster Dictionary of Synonyms.]] As the on-line reviews say, this an astonishingly good book, too little known.</p>
<p>I think it clarifies, by going into the history of the usage of the word &ldquo;art,&rdquo; why the discussions of this are so endless and futile. The word has different, overlapping meanings, which can even be at odds with one another. And this confuses those who try to pin it down to one meaning.</p>
<p>Here is a bit from the article on &ldquo;artist&rdquo; and its synonyms, including &ldquo;artisan&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earliest and the abiding implication of <em>artist</em> is skill or proficiency (see &ldquo;artist&rdquo; under EXPERT); it was in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, and later, applied to anyone who made or did things requiring learning and skill; thus a teacher, a philosopher, a physician, a scientist, a chemist, or a craftsman was then called an &ldquo;artist&rdquo;. &hellip;Gradually, however, the word became associated with those whose aim is to produce something which gives pleasure, first with musicians, dancers, actors, and the like, and later with poets, painters, and sculptors. The two ideas of skill and the aim to give pleasure were combined, so that since the early nineteenth century, &ldquo;artist,&rdquo; (when it does not mean specifically a painter) is usually applied to a gifted person who works in the fine arts, and especially one who reveals his skill, taste, and power to create beautiful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this clarifies the usage of &ldquo;art&rdquo; in relation to type design. When a design is particularly skilled, beautiful, or moving, such as the works of Garamond or Bodoni, we tend to call it a work of art. How to define or explain the aesthetic dimension is a thorny psychological and philosophical issue, but at least this clarifies the usage: When a type face is particularly beautiful or moving, it can appropriately be called a work of art by those who love type.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s only one implication.
Industrial design for mass production is certainly design, but so is an architect designing the plan (template) for a one-off building.</p>
<p>Surely the implication of design is that one creates an interim plan or template for a product that someone else may finish. 
Or oneself, if one likes to plant and care for one&rsquo;s own garden.</p>
<p>So designing a typeface, one designs and crafts glyphs that will combine nicely with each other, when the font is put to use to create typography. That&rsquo;s what I like best about type design, that the design and the craft (and the art) are so fundamentally entangled. Art used to be like that.</p>
<p>Similarly, a graphic designer creates artwork (a file) that may be output by someone else, even if there will be only one instance—a large sign or banner, for instance, or a presentation book.</p>
<p>Art directors and artists may also work like this.
Rodin, for instance, would make a small maquette, and his foundry (love that word) would scale it up and mass produce it.
Many artists today are not makers. Jeff Koons posed for and art directed his porno series, but he didn&rsquo;t shoot it. Similarly, in a recent exhibit curated as &ldquo;the artist as celebrity&rdquo;, it was interesting to see a collection of ads featuring Andy Warhol; the concept and art direction (design) of which was created by George Lois—an art director who was something of a celebrity, but not enough to warrant mention by the curator.</p>
<p>A musical score is also design, by another name.</p>
<p>Storyboards, as used in motion pictures and advertisements, are also design.
Filming and editing are more art and craft, when one or more shots are shot and cut (dissolved, etc.) together in such a way as to combine nicely according to the plan. Somewhat like typography interpreting a layout design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Matthew, Nick, you&rsquo;re right, of course, that design can involve a one-off thing, a building. Krenov was relating to furniture production, where there are many copies involved, and it is impossible to have the intimate relation to organic materials that he had with creating his furniture.</p>
<p>I think that one of the things which normally characterizes design is that the plan is more clearly separated from the execution than in an individual work of art. Of course one of the features of design, probably the defining one, is goals other than aesthetic ones.</p>
<p>In this sense I&rsquo;m not sure whether &ldquo;design&rdquo; fits writing a song or symphony. There the performance is separated from the score, but the goal is often more purely aesthetic. In movies you have &ldquo;sound design&rdquo; which is suiting the sound and I believe music to the visuals in a movie. In sound design, the sound and music are clearly subordinate to the goal of telling the story with emotional impact. In a song or symphony there is not usually such subordination.</p>
<p>In the case of type design, the type face is only fully realized later in the work of those who use it in print or on screen. And I agree with you Nick that one of the delights of type design is its mixture of design, art and craft.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill: <em>In this sense I&rsquo;m not sure whether &ldquo;design&rdquo; fits writing a song or symphony.</em></p>
<p>Although it isn’t common usage, I  think the concept of design can easily be applied to the overall structure of a piece of music. A fairly typical—if not definitive—aspect of design is that it can be schematised or abstracted in a diagram. A three-verse-bridge-two-verse song structure isn&rsquo;t a complex scheme, but it is still a scheme and provides a design framework for the artistic creativity of the melody and lyrics; obviously a symphonic work is usually much richer and multilayered in this regard, and more likely to have a unique structure, but that structure can be diagrammed, and the diagram reveals the design thinking of the composer.</p>
<p><em>There the performance is separated from the score, but the goal is often more purely aesthetic.</em></p>
<p>Bringing this back to typography, Tom Milo sometimes uses a musical metaphor when explaining how an Arabic calligrapher ‘performs’ the ‘score’ (text) with a particular ‘instrument’ (script style). This metaphor provides the model for what Tom’s Arabic engine and fonts seek to make available to typographers: a kind of synthesiser by which someone who lacks the manual virtuosity of the calligrapher can make performance choices within the range of the synthesised instrument.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, I&rsquo;m seeing that design, like art has at least two different dimensions—the aspect of serving a practical goal other than an aesthetic one, and the usual separation between the plan and the final product.</p>
<p>Some works of art, in the sense of being purely aesthetic in their goals, also may involve planning and execution by another person, though this seems to be less often true. They don&rsquo;t have the practical goal.</p>
<p>The question in my mind is whether the purely aesthetic goal is a real one. R.G. Collingwood, in his book Principles of Art argues the entertainment is a degraded goal, that is a corruption of art. But I wonder whether fine art itself is corrupted by pretending that it does not have the practical goal of entertainment, however high minded and entertainment that may be.</p>

<li>An individual must first decide if art to them is an achievement of a quality beyond or despite of the initial intent of the work (meaning that however or for what ever reasons, a given thing can be deemed Art).  This would lead them down the path towards &ldquo;there is no such thing as bad art&rdquo; because it is a state unto itself. With this direction, the distinction of &ldquo;art' is bestowed by perceivers of the work and that agreement on the distinction is quite up for disagreement.  You may choose whomsoever you like as an accredited bestower or bestowers of that honor (again opening the door for endless debate).</li>
<li>Another way to view it is that anything that is claimed to be art by anyone is art but you have the broadest qualitative expression of things from the very poorest art to the very best art. This again leaves room for a lifetime of debate. This goes along with the title &ldquo;Artist&rdquo;.  If everyone who professes to be an artist is an artist no matter how badly they may fail at making things or experiences you or anyone else might care to endure.  But with this way of seeing, being an artist is determined quite simply in the attempt, just like being a cab driver, dish washer, or tele-marketer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the first argument, we can say that anything can be considered &ldquo;art&rdquo; including typography or rotting fish if the perceiver or their duly self-appointed &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; deems it so.  The inevitable battle ensues in the case of multiple perceivers and multiple authorities debating the achievement.</p>
<p>Using the second argument, everything that intends to be art qualifies as art with the inevitable battle being moved now to the level of agreement on qualitative achievement. In this case, you can also continue the fight in the arena of endeavors which may qualify as being bona-fide pursuits of art.  You may have a nice tidy short list that represents only the most limited few: Painting, sculpture, drawing, music composition, creative writing, or choreography. You may then decide you should include performances of these works as art if you so desire.  You then add actors,musicians, dancers individual acts as qualifying as well, as the initial set of producers. Having done that, you now have even more battles to argue about as in: If Puccini&rsquo;s writing of La Boheme is a work of art with Pavorati as Rhodalfo is it still a work of art if it were instead performed by the guy who does the Aflak duck voice? Now we get to argue about a work of art transcending its performance or a performance transcending the level of the work performed.</p>
<p>From there we can go back and fight over the inclusion of architecture as an art form along with sculpture or other disciplines such as graphic design, type design, typesetting or art direction in an ad firm being blessed with inclusion.  We can then expand this to everything from basket weaving to regurgitation if that pleases anyone.</p>
<p>However we try to limit the designation of art, we open ourselves to endless debate with no possible agreement at the end.  Those who enjoy the pursuit will continue as humankind has for centuries and those who find the engagements tiring may move on to other activities. For me, I just make stuff without pretense of art or grandeur.  If someone at some point decides something I have done is worthy of the &ldquo;A Word&rdquo;, that is their choice.  If a few others care to argue that person&rsquo;s pronouncement, that is their choice.  I will just continue &ldquo;making stuff&rdquo; just as before but I might find some amusement in hearing the debate ;-)</p>
<p>Either art is what it is or it is an argument waiting to happen.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Obviously a tomato is both a fruit and a vegetable, and the question only arises because of a confusion of categories. Fruit is a botanical term and vegetable is a culinary term. There is some common overlap of these terms, insofar as fruit also has a distinct culinary meaning, and all inanimate organic matter is vegetable, but with regard to the tomato the usage is clear: fruit is how it grows, vegetable is how it is used in the kitchen.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John Hudson&rsquo;s point about someone who makes custom items (shoes, gloves etc.), and his disconnect due to &ldquo;producing a font that is going to ship with some hundreds of millions of copies of Microsoft Windows&rdquo; was particularly interesting to me.</p>
<p>Coming from a background in which I spent several years apprenticing as a bespoke tailor, I can say that both trades have this same feeling associated with them (at least it&rsquo;s felt by those in the trades). When we would have a client who would demand some ugly detailing or fabric choice - despite our pleads - we would still make the garments with the same care as if it were a beautiful pairing of design and fabric. The same, I suspect, is true when one would be designing a typeface with which they feel very little emotional connection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always separated art into two categories: &ldquo;art&rdquo; and &ldquo;Art&rdquo;. The latter is that in which the item that is produced is the end goal - a painting or a sculpture for instance - while &ldquo;art&rdquo; is used to describe the craft put into something which will function in a role outside of its own aesthetic qualities (type, tailoring, welding, etc), and fulfill a need.</p>
<p>Though &ldquo;fulfilling a need&rdquo; may seem strong, I&rsquo;ve chosen it because, while one could go to any Wal-Mart and buy clothing, those who appreciate and can afford the means would go to a tailor. The same is true of type design; those who appreciate type would be more likely to venture outside the realm of pre-installed fonts.</p>
<p>I have more thoughts on the subject but I think this is enough of an idea for now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Art should not have to either entertain or uplift.  It may just as well just cause one to ponder for whatever reason, it could even make a viewer uneasy or even feel provoked.  I would just say that &ldquo;Art&rdquo; should evoke some human feeling beyond &ldquo;I like it&rdquo; or &ldquo;That is pretty&rdquo; or &ldquo;That would look good with my sofa&rdquo;. 
For me, the Big A &ldquo;Art&rdquo; requires something or other transferred from artwork to viewer that elevates it beyond the merely benign, beyond just functional (without functional being ether required or dismissed), beyond just aesthetically pleasing.  The problem for me is, that if I could define what that &ldquo;something&rdquo; is it would be so limiting as to destroy the value of the definition.  Therefore, I submit only that &ldquo;Art is What it is&rdquo; and no amount of laboring over a universal definition would get one closer to the &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; than just letting it be what it is. Either way agreement will not happen&ndash;even though, through discussion, we may become more cognizant of what others may feel about what Art is to them.</div>

<p>Yes, I think there is a similar feeling or sense in the making, but a kind of cognitive &lsquo;wobble&rsquo; in the realisation that this thing that you are engaged with as a craft work is going to be experienced by others as something like a mass consumer product.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Every profession has that same concept, I think.</p>
<p>For example, the machines that can convert a piece of aluminum into a filled can of pepsi are things that I would likely never be able to engineer or appreciate on the same level as those that are involved in its creation. Yet its product is something one could buy and enjoy without ever once considering that there is an amount of craft and &ldquo;art&rdquo; that goes into the creation of their beverage.</p>
<p>I would guess that 99% of people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to spot a bespoke suit from a Men&rsquo;s Warehouse suit. That doesn&rsquo;t take away from the skill that went into it. If I wear a sportcoat I spent months making out to a social event, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anyone to recognize the cut or the fit or any aesthetic aspects. If one went out in a terribly made and poorly fitting coat, it would attract attention (not in a positive way); the same holds true to type.</p>
<p>I would guess that most people don&rsquo;t choose careers that are craft based for the purpose of making everyone appreciate the skill.</p>
