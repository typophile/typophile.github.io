  where it shouldn't have, I got myself mixed up)\r\n\r\nLooking for some guidance
  on fonts looking similar to the attached sample. (The raised appearance and the
  option of using two colours (in this case the raised gold border and enamel) are
  of particular interest).\r\n\r\nRealize the sample photo itself is a hand carved
  'one off' but any suggestions for commercially available fonts in a similar vein
  please?\r\n\r\nthanks as always for the input and best wishes\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "Thanks Special-K...appreciate the input. \r\n\r\n'Limelight' is a reasonable
    starting point because of it's high contrast art deco style (to be honest, before
    my post I'd already scoured Broadway fonts from the 1920's). Unfortunately, it's
    a bit too commonly used for what I'm after...\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts anyone?
    \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are thick and thin sans that you could edit to get this result, but
    nothing off the shelf. One problem is that your image has the thick stroke of
    the A on the lhs rather than the rhs where it is conventionally placed.\r\nSo
    take a thick and thin A, mirror it and you have the first A. For the second A
    rotate an I 90 degrees, clip to length and you have it. For the i change the dot
    to a square, if your base font does not already have this.\r\nSome candidates
    -- with varying contrast -- are: Britannic Bold, Castle Ultra, Globe Gothic, Imperial
    Ultra Bold, koala, Linex Sans Bold [this one has the square dot], PC Gothic, Scotsdale,
    XenoisSemiHeavy, Oil Can....\r\nDon"

    the mirroring etc to change the side of the thick stroke but was struggling for
    fonts that I might use as a base in the first place...\r\n\r\nReally appreciate
    your suggestions- many thanks!\r\n\r\nSteve "
