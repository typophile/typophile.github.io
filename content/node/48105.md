    looks like it might be Benton's Cloister (I think it was called Cloister anyway...it
    was his magnum opus if I recall correctly)...lucky you!\r\nC12 (and B6) looks
    like Extra Condensed News Gothic.\r\nAnd the other one in B6 is Kaufman Script.\r\n\r\nIs
    the top one a Garamond Italic?\r\n\r\nThe rest I'll leave up to the pros around
    here!\r\n\r\nAnd if you're interested in ATF type, you have to be interested in
    [[http://www.daleguild.com/|Theo Rehak]]. The Dale Guild site might be of some
    help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Thomas & Koppa,\r\n\r\nB6 & C12 are definitely <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-gothic/condensed/\"
    target=\"_blank\">News Gothic Condensed</a>; the lowercase \"g\" is the confirming
    glyph.\r\n\r\nB5: After doing some digging I've come up with a variety of versions
    of this type in digitized forms, all under the name of Jensen/Jenson Old Style:\r\nOne
    design by <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/jensen-old-style/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Jordan Davies</a> for Wooden Type Fonts;\r\nand another by <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/jenson-old-style/\" target=\"_blank\">Freda
    Sack</a> for Linotype, but a third provided the best info:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/phinney-jenson/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Phinney Jenson</a>, released digitally by HiH Retrofonts, seems
    to most clearly provide details on the provinance of this type in metal:\r\n\r\n<em>In
    1890 a leader of the Arts & Crafts movement in England named William Morris founded
    Kelmscott Press. He was an admirer of Jenson\u2019s Roman and drew his own somewhat
    darker version called \u201CGolden\u201D, which he used for the hand-printing
    of limited editions on homemade paper, initiating the revival of fine printing
    in England.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Morris' efforts came to the attention of Joseph Warren
    Phinney, manager of the Dickinson Type Foundry of Boston. Phinney requested permission
    to issue a commercial version, but Morris was philosophically opposed and flatly
    refused. So Phinney designed a commercial variation of Golden type and released
    it in 1893 as Jenson Oldstyle. Phinney Jenson is our version of Phinney\u2019s
    version of Morris' version of Nicolas Jenson\u2019s Roman.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's a
    clunky / quaint attempt at Jenson, but an interesting curiosity to have in the
    drawer.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStill very curious about those smaller fonts (D1, 2, 3,
    7, 8, 15; B2 & 9).\r\n\r\nKoppa, I do know of Theo & Dale Guild and have fallen
    hard for their Cloister Light Face; unfortunately I can't afford Theo's minimum
    order at the moment, but I'm attempting to find a few others to band together
    to place an order. It's the most beautiful version of the Jenson type that I've
    ever seen."

    for some of that [[http://www.daleguild.com/CloisterOS.html|Cloister]].\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    my type and my press have been in storage for 4 years now (hardly believable).
    I do hope to resurrect it in 2009, and for sure by 2010. I have to wait for my
    daughters to not need a play room anymore. That's when their playroom becomes

    some help on this one I'd be very grateful. (And thanks for the assistance thus
    far.)\r\n\r\nKoppa, I'll likely pester you down the road about that Cloister;
    the Light Face isn't shown on the Dale Guild website, but it's extremely handsome
    in print. I have someone New York state who is also wanting some, but he and I
    want different sizes (I'm after the 14 & 16pt, and he's after 18); the type is
    quite small on the body, so 16 seems ideal to me for poetry (which is primarily
    what I print).\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to this thread's topic. Here is the list of

  body: "I think D15 looks like a Caslon Oldstyle or especially Linotype's Caslon
    Old Face, which has a very similar swash N (however, now that I look at it the
    italic K is not the same as your sample -- your sample's K is quite odd looking,
    with a very low join for the upper arm and stem. The l.c. italic k is also odd).
    In Mac McGrew's book of American Metal Typefaces this seemed about the closest
    I found, but the more letters I look at, the more doubt I have that I am seeing
    anything that matches enough of the letters.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Caslons is
    that they were probably one of the most common typefaces, and every foundry had
    multiple versions. There are no marks that help identify the foundry?\r\n\r\n-
