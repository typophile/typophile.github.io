body: "Hi. My fonts where designed in Fontlab, generated as ttf fonts. Those were
  imported to Volt where open-type features were added.\r\nAfter shipping from Volt
  the file ended up with a ttf file-format name.  Can I manually change the shipped
  font's name from AlQuds.ttf to AlQuds.otf?  Any advantages or disadvantages?  Thanks"

  body: Occasionally, I have made CFF fonts which simply don't work, usually ones
    with complex outlines. In such cases, I copied the font an changed the extension
    to .otf, and the font worked fine. I would imagine that it would worked the opposite
    way, too.

    the font and the creator's desire for compatibility on systems without native

    outlines may have either .OTF or .TTF, depending on the desire for backward compatibility
    on older systems or with previous versions of the font. TrueType Collection fonts
    should have a .TTC extension whether or not the fonts have OpenType layout tables
    present.\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much oldnick and Karl Stange\r\nMy workflow was to design
    the font in Fontlab using PS outlines, generate a TT font, use that in Volt to
    ship a font with TT outlines and filename TTF. It works fine in all modern applications,
    but as an Arabic font it has many OpenType features, and an OTF filename seems
    more true to type (excuse the pun) - so I will change it to OTF. \r\nRight?"

  body: "\r\nttf as well as otf both types of fonts  may contain OpenType features.
    It is not necessary to change ttf to otf due to Open Type features. If you want
    to use otf then you should generate the otf files from fontlab not from volt.
    Then apply the OpenType features to this otf in the volt. When you open a otf
    file in volt, volt will not show the outlines and instead you will see all glyph
    cells empty as volt render only ttf outlines not ps outlines. But it will not
    effect the final shipped font and the final otf shipped from volt will work correctly
    in all applications. If your original outlines are ps then changing it to ttf
    will cause a very very little change or you may say distortion in the outlines
    and in most cases the glyph shaping will not be much affected but you should manually
    check all the glyph outlines to avoid any glyph shape distortion."

  body: Thank you Ustaz Zuhair. Indeed I am trying to avoid  change to TT outlines
    because of the changes you mentioned. However when I generate the font from FL
    to OTF Volt cannot open it. Indeed if I try to open the OTF file in FL even FL
    says there are errors and does not open it. I wonder why.

  body: The method worked when generating the otf from Fontlab as a BINARY (not compiled).
    Volt compiles it as described by Mr. Zuhair. Thank you.
