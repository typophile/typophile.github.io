body: "There are, here on the Type ID Board, some recurring requests, which often
  haven\u2019t a definitive answer or, being custom work, are followed by questions
  about available alternatives. \r\nAfter the n-nth request, someone (usually Florian
  ;-) compiles a list of fonts in that particular style.\r\nBut these useful lists
  get buried under the subsequent hundreds of similarly \u201CPlease ID this font\u201D-titled
  threads, making it difficult to find and refer to them.\r\nSo, here I would like
  to compile a list of such lists, with proper descriptions, for easier access and
  discoverability.\r\n\r\nPlease add any comprehensive list you\u2019re aware of,
  or create a new one ;-)\r\nAlso, feel free to suggest appropriate keywords.\r\n\r\n<strong>So,

  body: "Craig, \r\nyes, if you want to, feel free to transfer these lists to the
    Typowiki. The reason why I didn\u2019t do that myself is that I don\u2019t see
    much benefit, except that maybe it is easier for others to add to the lists. Most
    of these lists were created ad hoc, by and for the members of the Type ID Board.
    I don\u2019t want this to become bureaucratic, and to argue with others whether
    the lists were academic/complete/useful enough to be included in the Typowiki
    \u2013 which, by its encyclopedic nature, is regarded as a place that is a little
    more formal and authoritative than the quick notes and comments in the threads.
    Nor do I want to keep them tidy (or even restore them), after they eventually
    get vandalized. Still, some of them (optical sizes, grades) are predestined to
    become a helpful Wiki entry.\r\n\r\nMike,\r\ntrue, your <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/\">Bowfin
    Printworks</a> website holds a lot more information and tools that are of great
    use to typeface IDers. Thank you for providing and maintaining it! Your <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\">Script
    ID Guide</a> is one of my favorite ID resources.\r\nThis brings us to the question
    what the focus of this thread should be: Ready-made lists (be they curated or
    collectively compiled, illustrated or not) only, or rather all kinds of ID resources?
    The Serif Font ID Guide can be used to create lists, but it is more a filter tool,
    like <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/identify.html\">Identifont\u2019s \u2018by
    appearance\u2019 questionnaire</a>, or MyFonts\u2019 Advanced Search that lets
    you create a list of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Ascript+designer%3A%28Matthew+Carter%29/fonts/\">scripts
    by Matthew Carter</a>, for example."

  body: "Thank you all for the additions! :-)\r\nI\u2019m with Florian about the extemporaneous
    nature of these lists and that just few would be really wiki material.\r\n(Plus,
    as Craig notes, they will need to be linked here anyway, because wiki entries
    aren't really discoverable.)\r\n\r\nAbout FontShop\u2019s FontLists: they\u2019re
    indeed useful (and decidedly an inspiration for this very thread). There often
    is a thread which starts from one of these and adds to them, for example:\r\n\r\nThe
    Spurless Sans list, collective\r\nKeywords: Ubuntu, Prokyon\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/68016\r\n\r\nAnother
    less, if ever, used external resource would be MyFont\u2019s Albums (example:
    http://new.myfonts.com/users/dtk5k4mb2g/albums/207781/). Admittedly, the fact
    that they\u2019re less curated, make them less useful.\r\nAnd they share the same
    shortcoming of FontShop\u2019s lists: being limited to one retailer offerings."

    guy? That\u2019s not very helpful (the section name, not Steven. He actually introduced
    me to Mike Parker. Thank you for that. You\u2019re right, Mike tells great stories.).\r\n\r\nriccard0
    raised a good point, but there is another aspect that people seem to be overlooking.\r\n\r\nWe
    can easily make a (Wiki?) section with categories and examples. Just like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/category/\">FontShop\u2019s
    category section</a> which we can update over time.  <em>However</em>, people
    will still post in the ID section, and end up getting buried list-like responses.\r\n\r\nSolution?\r\n\r\nA
    single new board for \u201CWhat are some fonts similar to this?\u201D requests.
    This removes them from the ever-burying ID board. Then, on the afore mentioned
    \u201CSimilar\u201D board, more experienced Typophiles can simply point the poster
    to the correct Wiki section. Problem solved. \r\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s a hidden
    bonus to this solution: <em>If</em>, in the initial post there is an actual ID
    request, <em>and</em>, it gets solved (followed by list-like responses, the initial
    problem statement), <em>then</em>, the ID can be added to the Wiki.  Now, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xos2MnVxe-c\">the
    Wiki grows on its own</a>!\r\n\r\nRemember, people will always be posts on the
    wrong boards. There\u2019s nothing we can do to prevent this 100%. This issue
    can only be addressed through moderation, and moving threads.\r\n\r\nSee also
