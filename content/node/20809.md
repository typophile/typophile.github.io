  body: "Yep Rockwell definitley an influence, but it's more cursive than mine. The
    slabs on mine are pure regtangles whereas Rockwells are adjusted optically. Mine
    isn't for text setting so I don't need to do that. \r\n\r\nCheck out the differences
    here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.detail.ie/King_vs_Rockwell.gif\r\n\r\nPlus I hope to develop
    alternates for the characters. \r\n\r\nCheers."
