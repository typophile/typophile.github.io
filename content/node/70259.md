body: "Having recently donated $100 to Typophile, I felt I could propose the following
  feature requests for Typophile without coming across as overly entitled\u2026\r\n\r\nSorted
  in descending order of desire:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Personalized RSS feed
  to follow multiple threads</strong><br>\r\nI've noticed some people adding a solitary
  period as a comment on interesting threads, presumably so that they will see related
  updates on their user \"Track\" page. This seems an indication to me of a desire
  for some better way to follow threads without commenting on them. The most simple
  way of doing this would probably be to have \"Follow this\" links, which would add
  threads to a user-customized listing / RSS stream. Even if individual RSS feeds
  existed for every thread, a single \"Threads I'm Following\" feed that was managed
  on the site would keep my RSS subscription list more manageable.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Proper
  HTML blockquotes</strong><br>\r\nOther than the obvious benefit of having appropriate
  semantic formatting, having blockquotes in the allowed HTML tags might also introduce
  some consistency in how users respond to each other's remarks; currently, some people
  will quote using emphasis tags, others will start each line with angle brackets,
  etc.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Permalinks for specific comments</strong><br>\r\nI
  realize that if I really want to, I can view a thread's source code and get anchor
  names for each comment and link accordingly, but it's tedious. <a href=http://twitter.com/ilovetypography/status/12592920561>I'm
  not alone</a> in the desire to have the functionality more accessible, and it doesn't
  need to be much more complicated than linking each comment's timestamp.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nIf
  any of these features exist and I'm just not seeing them, please feel free to correct
  me.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

    supposed to go in Joe\u2019s Corner. It\u2019s curious that our ostensibly omnipresent
    \u201Cmoderators\u201D haven\u2019t moved it there yet.\r\n\r\nTwo of your three
    requests I made months ago. So don\u2019t hold your breath. And your $100 was,
    it would seem, wasted."

  body: Just curious why this forums uses custom code? I know they want to have it
    integrated with he rest of the site, but if they used a free message board like
    SMF or something they wouldnt have to deal with most of these issues. Their might
    be newer ones or some spam issues, but even those can be dealt with easier.

  body: "From what I understand, it's built on a highly customized install of Drupal,
    which apparently makes it hard to edit.\r\n\r\nWith such a momentous development
    as web fonts just coming over the horizon, Typophile is becoming a forum for more
    and more conversations that are literally changing the future of the type industry.
    With that in mind, some of these requested features \u2013 as rinky-dink as they
    may seem \u2013 are perhaps more valuable now than ever."

    I feel your pain - in all these areas and more. As a matter of fact, I have a
    very long running list of my own complaints for the site.\r\n\r\nI'm not here
    to make excuses, though I have a pocketful of them, I just want to say we are
    listening and I am going to do my best to try to make something happen to address
    many of the bugs and needed features for the site.\r\n\r\nThanks all for your

    to hear! This blockquote style seems as good as anything. Though \u2026 it is
    a bit awkward to have the indentation at the beginning of a comment. The only
    other thing I might try would be the indent but with a subtle vertical rule to
    the left (?) Maybe it'd be overkill. I trust your judgement.\r\n\r\nAlso: per-comment
    permalinks are great!"

    a line like:\r\n\r\n<code>blockquote em { font-style: regular; }</code>\r\n\r\nso
    that emphasis will still be emphasis. :)\r\n\r\nA &lt;pre&gt; would also be very
    useful!"
