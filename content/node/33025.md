  East region. I'd like to incorporate a symbol of knowledge as part of the artwork.
  But the problem is the meaning of symbols might be very different in different parts
  of the world.\r\n\r\nFor example a popular symbol of knowledge/wisdom in Poland
  (Europe) is an owl but who knows what it means in Kuwait?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wpodkowie.osdw.pl/custom/_3/img/logo.png\r\n\r\nA
  kind of safe symbol might be a book but maybe there is something different and more
  specific for Middle East culture?\r\n\r\nOh, also any references to Middle East
  ornaments would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nAL"
