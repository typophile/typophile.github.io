    Ultra]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/egyptienne-2/|Egyptienne]] but
    they're not matching...\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've managed to find the sample origin. According
    to these [[http://kglteater.dk/OmTeateret/Organisation/Oekonomi.aspx|PDFs]], should
    be the own corporate typeface of [[http://kglteater.dk|Det Kongelige Teater]],
    named DKT."
