    body: "Hi,\r\nIt could be. I didn't see that, and I'm supposed to be looking for
      a font to <em>replace</em> Franklin Gothic... This is why this site humbles
      me.\r\n\r\nBut, the example is from Bon Magazine, so the problem is I wouldn't
      expect them to squoosh fonts, unless it's a custom made squooshing they've ordered.
      Here are also a few more examples where I think at least 'j', 'c' and 'y' are
      different to Franklin? \r\n\r\nThe font is also used throughout their website
      www.bonmagazine.com.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justice_5735.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/handsome_5255.jpg]"

  body: Good job, Conor. Embarrassed I missed that cut, especially since I should
    have known it wasn't squooshed.

    body: "I wasn't actually looking for anything too similar to Franklin. So I surprised
      myself when I realised that it was the first thing I stumbled upon - embarrasingly
      not recognising the cut. Maybe unconsciously I am not yet ready to give up on
      Franklin, it has served me well.\r\n\r\nBut, the remaining problem is that on
      the text setting Franklin seems too rigid to me now. Here is a link to a thread
      on what I'm looking for: http://typophile.com/node/32883\r\n\r\n\r\n"
