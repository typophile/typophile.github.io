  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">After visiting family on the west coast over the holidays, I returned home the long route due to snow in Chicago, &#40;over 24 hrs city hopping on standby&#41;. The upside was that I got to gander at several newspapers along the way &#40;New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, San Jose Mercury News and San Francisco Chronicle&#41;. I was too shot to compare from a content standpoint, but it was interesting from a design perspective. The SF Chronicle is a lovely looking paper, tops of the group in my opinion. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spent a bit of time researching the Chronicle redesign and didn&#39;t find too much &#40;it was Danilo/Black job I think, but their site lays claim only to the sunday edition&#41;. Anyone know what the type is and who did it &#40;not the condensed sans, the serif headline and body&#41;? It is a beautiful combination of fresh character and legibility. By contrast, the others looked stale &#40;suprising to me, even Gulliver in USA Today seemed blah&#41;. <BR> <BR>The San Jose Merc type is ugliness personified &#40;IMHO&#41; despite it&#39;s redesign. <BR> <BR>In the end content is king, but a casual design survey was fun. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Funny, Simon, I was wondering the same thing the other day. Unger seems to take a pragmatic stance about those things, in that you can&#39;t control what the user does with your work &#40;and you should just be happy they bought the stuff&#41;. Of course a very good reason not to get nasty is that a past customer could be a future customer. <BR> <BR>The type of stuff he says about it is &#34;you wouldn&#39;t think it would work but that&#39;s the way their readers seem to like it&#34;, etc... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the link. Of interest to me were the comments about using Gulliver for text and display. The SF Chronicle also uses the same font for text and headlines &#40;alternated with a sans&#41;, though it looks like a special display version. At any rate, it looks sharp and unified. Again, anybody know who did the type? I&#39;ll post in the ID section too. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One thing you can do is visit the indispensable newseum.org , go to the &#34;Today&#39;s Front Pages&#34; section, see if the paper you want entered that day &#40;it&#39;s highly variable&#41;, download the PDF &#40;sometimes a bitmap PDF though&#41; and check in the doc info for the font names. Custom faces often have unpublished names however, but you can always sic Google on it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Google has been really kind to Typographica lately. <BR> <BR>Randy - I answered your <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?83/23420" target="_blank">your SF Chron post in the Font ID forum</a>,  <BR>but I am going by memory of a long-standing design.
