Ok, so this one of mine gave me a three day deadline for a project, was impatient when I delivered later in the afternoon, then didn't respond for a week.  Earlier this week, I get a response that says, sorry for keeping you waiting, I'll let you know tomorrow.

Still haven't heard back.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not sure I fully understand your question. Are you concerned about a project falling behind schedule while you're waiting for feedback? Or just annoyed that you rushed to meet their deadline and now they're acting like the deadline wasn't so important after all?

When a project has a tight deadline I'll remind the client when I drop off layouts that I must have their feedback by a certain date if we're going to stay on schedule. If they miss that deadline, I remind them. I've found most clients to be appreciative of such reminders as long as they are done politely.

It's important that discussions of schedule be in writing (email, for example) so you've got a written record if they try to blame you later for the project falling behind schedule.

On the other hand, if you're mainly just annoyed that you worked hard to meet a deadline and suddenly the deadline is starting to look rather arbitrary, well, I agree that it's a frustrating situation.  Not much you can do about a client who is thoughtless except decide not to work for them again if you're really ticked off about it. But personally I can put up with a lot of annoying behavior as long as they pay my invoices on time.

		<div class="commentbody">I can sympathize with your feelings.
But, they are the client and you like to work for them. If not, end the relation.

Clients don't tell you everything that is going on in the office. 
Maybe there a lot of politics going on you have no clue about. If you did now, you may react in a different way.

If this is becoming a normal way of doing business on their part, you can discuss this with them. I don't see any problems doing that.

See yourself as an extension of your client. If you make your clients life easier, you will have a happy client. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Years ago I did a rush job for an important client. They told me they HAD to have it by noon the next day.  I put my other projects on hold, worked all day and all night, drove to the airport like a madman at 6 am to put the package on a flight so they'd have it by noon, and was in such a rush that I dented my car's bumper in the airport parking lot. But I made it.

Two days later I still hadn't heard a "thank you", so I called. The client said "Yeah I've got your package here somewhere, but I haven't had time to look at it yet."  
 
I wanted to scream. But they were otherwise a good client, so I let it slide.
