  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everybody,

my name is Fivos Vilanakis and this is my first post in Typophile forums.
I'm the chief technical officer at Softonium Developments Inc and I'd like to introduce our new application named "Find my Font".

<img src="http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-Win-Connected-Letters_sm.png" alt="Find my Font Screenshot 1" /> <img src="http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-OSX-Main_sm.jpg" alt="Find my Font Screenshot 2" />

Product site:  http://www.findmyfont.com

'Find my Font' reads scanned images or photos and then goes through all the fonts on your computer and matches the letters in the scanned image against the fonts in your computer. You are provided with a list of matching fonts along with the matching accuracy for each one. You may also type some text and see how well the matching went.

It's ideal for font designers, graphic designers and creative professionals who would otherwise spend hours trying to find a matching font.

The main features of "Find my Font" are:

<strong>1. It runs natively on both Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7) and Mac OS/X (intel based)</strong>

<strong>2. It works with all common image formats or a screen capture</strong>
You can load any common image file (bmp, gif, jpg, png, tif, +others) or use the screen capture tool to work with a web image or a the on-screen image of another application.

<strong>3. Smart selection tools - No special image preprocessing required</strong>
It provides special tools to easily select any letters present in a color image with no need for a white-background or special image preprocessing. You can e.g. rotate the image, make the text baseline horizontal, split any script letters, or select a letter placed on a complex color background with a few simple clicks.

<strong>4. Matches all of your OTF/TTF fonts either installed or not</strong>
It matches the letters you select from an image, against all Open Type (*.otf) or True Type (*.ttf) fonts installed in your system. You can also specify any number of additional folders containing not installed OTF/TTF fonts and even switch on/off any of these font-sets on a specific matching.

<strong>5. Unicode support</strong>
The Find my Font (Pro edition) supports both matching & indexing on the full unicode range of font characters.

<strong>6. Incredible matching speed!</strong>
The latest version of 'Find my Font' achieves incredible matching speeds. Thanks to our new proprietary indexing algorithm the application is able to scan up to 5 million fonts per minute. At these speeds you can examine e.g. 100.000-200.000 fonts in just 5-10 seconds!

<strong>7. Precise Matching!</strong>
You can find both exact matches of the font you are searching and/or similar fonts. 
<strong>When it comes to matching accuracy we are confident enough to say that, If you don't see an exact match of the font you are searching on the top 5 matching positions, this font probably does not exist in your computer!</strong>
Try the free-trial edition to believe it!

You can find more on product-editions or download the free-trial application here:

http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/compare-editions


<strong>Using "Find my Font" as a copyright protection tool</strong>
There is a special use of Find my Font for font designers: To protect your copyrighted work.
We all know there are many sites out there claiming they have "free fonts" but most of these are not actually free but illegal copies of commercial fonts packaged under different filenames and/or different family names.
If you download all available fonts of a "free fonts" site and use your font design as input, Find my Font can tell you in seconds if there are any illegal copies of your design in the downloaded fonts.
...and this is only possible because you can instruct Find my Font to match against e.g. 100.000 fonts and still get very accurate results in just 5-10 seconds!


I know that font designers are actually the most demanding users of our application and I'd love to hear your opinion and thoughts whatever it is - things you like, you don't like, things to improve, anything.

<strong>For this reason we have decided to give 15 Promotion-Codes for Typophile users to download the Find my Font Pro edition for Windows or Mac OS for free.</strong>
The only thing we ask in return is to write your opinion here in this thread to help us improve our product.

<strong>Feel free to respond to this message and ask me to send you a free promotion-code to download the Pro Edition.</strong>

<strong>Current Count: All PROMO-CODES are given!</strong>


I wish you lots of creative time!

Fivos Vilanakis
Software Engineer
Softonium Developments


PS: Although the main purpose of this message is promotional, I have to admit that I'm personally involved in both design and coding of the product and I'm really proud of the final result, therefore I really need to hear your opinion about it. Thank you for your time!

I like that there are so many people in Typophile

		<div class="commentbody">Now First impressions upon using the software: Like the interface - straight forward and easy to learn, uses standard keystrokes like shift to add element in multipart characters. I can see this as a great creative aid as well as for straight identification - gives you variants in same range for consideration from your font collection. Also the font preview window lets you compare the match to see how close other fonts are to original sample. Usefulness of this tool knows no limits as a way to view your font collection. Impressed on first half hour of playing with it.</div>

I had the same thought after reading the description. But then I realized that its restrictions to one's own library, showing me what I have, is its strength. If I would want to (search for and) license fonts that I don't have, I would use something like WhatTheFont.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bob, Stephen & Karsten
thank you all for your thoughts.

I'm glad you find the interface easy and straight forward because that was one of our primary goals.

I agree that a different UI skin would make the application more attractive, but there are some inherent limitations due to the Nokia's Qt framework we use to produce the dual Windows / Mac version. Every "beautification" of the UI must be designed & tested to work well on both Mac & Windows and this is not always easy.

I agree that a connection to a big external font library would be a great plus for the application, although as Karsten pointed out the "restriction" of searching only your own library can also be considered as a big advantage: You may find similar fonts that you already have and you could avoid to buy a new one (or the same one).

Another alternative could be to create a proprietary font library for each major font distributor (e.g. Adobe, Linotype) and let Find my Font download them and use them for matching. Such libraries will contain off-course only the required matching information -not the actual fonts- and maybe a link to the distributor's site to view/buy any fonts you need. But you already have WhatTheFont if you want to go this way.

We are examining carefully all the alternatives and some of them are even under development, but I can't say more or promise anything at the moment.

		<div class="commentbody">εφχαριστο πολλη!

Although the user interface seemed odd to me, it worked like a charm after I got the hang of it! Perhaps because I am using OSX Lion, the screenshot tool just gave a black rectangle the proportion of my screen.  If I made a normal Mac screenshot with Command/shift/4 and selected a glyph with it, it worked fine.  I could not get the cropping tool to do anything but draw blue lines. I also tried glyphs with diacritics such as eogonek but had no way to let the software no the proper glyph name?  When I chose Greek glyphs and switched to Greek keyboard, it worked fine!

I gave it a tough time by using close valued colors and it did not blink!  
I have designed a face which stays the same weight but varies in width with some fairly close gradations; and it picked the correct one each time! I will post a few images to show what I tested.  As a general rule, it seems to need stem width of at least 3 pixels wide to get started, otherwise, it selects only a piece of the glyph.

I would say that this is a valuable tool for me!

THANKS!!!

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, 
thank you so much for your time and the extended test you performed!

(a) Regarding the screenshot tool, you are right: It gives a black image in OSX Lion - we will fix this on next release.


(b) Regarding your comment "I also tried glyphs with diacritics such as eogonek but had no way to let the software no the proper glyph name?"
You are right again, although the "Text To Match" box accepts the full unicode range of characters you need to switch to the appropriate keyboard to type the character you want. I think we should develop an alternate input method to allow easy insertion of any unicode character.


(c) Many many thanks for the font-variations test!
We never performed such a test, and I'm glad the results are good.


(d) Regarding your comment "could not separate reverse figure ground here;"
you can use the following options to separate/select letters when their color is very close to background:
1) Change the Tolerance Letter Selection Tool to a lower level from e.g. 32 (the default) to 10 or lower. This can be modified either in preferences or by click and hold the mouse button on Letter Selection Tool.
2) If after lowering the tolerance, the letter selection tool selects only part of a letter, you can hold-down the Shift or Control key and append many selections to the current letter until all main parts of the letters are selected.
(See also:
Help -> How To Procedures -> Letter Selection -> Selecting multi-part letters)


(e) Regarding your comment "I could not get the cropping tool to do anything but draw blue lines"
The Letter Splitter Tool does not actually crop the image but enables you to draw blue lines which are used as boundaries when you select the next letter. You just draw a line at the position you want the letters to be split and then you select the next letter as usual. I think it's easier this way...
This will also work well with the Greek double Gamma letters.
(See also: Help -> Tutorials -> Split Text)


(f) Regarding your comment "Ligatures and swashes were problematic but as long as I chose a normal glyph, it works pretty well!", 
I suppose this is related to Letter Selection Tool tolerance and multiple selection method I described in (d) above. 
If not, would you please elaborate more on this issue?

Thank you again for your time :-)

Fivos,
That is part of the story but not what I was looking for. For me, it would be valuable to find and match ligatures and even alternate for a font.  When designing type, I often make many variations on either ligatures or mostly contextual alternates that only come into play in certain situations or combinations of glyphs. I find it hard to tell from my printed samples, which of the variants was chosen by the coding.  Most variants are there to get around awkward joins.  An example might be the ear of the g.  It can work fine with most letters but get awkward next to a "y"--a common possibility.  I realize that his is a very specialized need and surely not worthy of you losing any sleep.  There might be 500 people in the world who might care--hardly a big market!

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the promo code. I spent quite a while today using "Find My Font" and trying different settings -- it's very useful! For the record, I have a good friend who is a manager at Adobe and I'll show him the software next month when I see him. He doesn't work in Adobe acquisitions, but nonetheless I think he'll be impressed.

So, here are my notes. I've been told I can be brutally critical....so don't take my opinion personally. It's meant to be constructive criticism. 

After I entered my license number to activate the software, a popup dialog said the application "will restart" so I clicked OK. It didn't restart; it just quit. Eventually, I stopped waiting and restarted it myself. No big deal, but it made me wonder how stable the software was.

It works pretty well; no crashes, freezes, or confusing/incomplete documentation. It accurately finds fonts based on pixels, which is impressive and quite useful. I expect to use it often. If I don't encounter bugs over the next few weeks, I'll gladly recommend it to clients and co-workers. 

What would I change? Rather than showing a (text-only) list of possible matches, I'd like to see thumbnails. It's kinda cumbersome to scroll through and see each font preview individually. I'd rather compare thumbnail previews of all the possible matches visually in one window. 

Honestly? This might sound harsh, but……I'd be very unlikely to buy this software based on the website and logo. No offense, but clearly your logo wasn't done by a professional graphic designer. Had I found your software/website via google, I'd seriously doubt this company knows anything about type design, graphic design or typography. In fact, the only reason I even noticed you on Typophile was because I was puzzled how somebody who used a faux-metallic gradient avatar (that isn't optically centered) had an eye sharp enough to visually identify so many fonts in the forum. 

This fear was not abated (heightened actually) when I saw the very first page of "Tutorial 1" boldly featured Arial, Comic and Calibri. (Shudder!) Frankly….I was embarrassed to have the window open to the tutorial graphics and looked over my shoulder hoping my co-worker didn't notice! :) 

So, if your target market is graphic designers..….maybe hire one to add some visual sophistication? And, for the love of Jan Tschichold, stop with all the Comic Sans unless you're a kindergarten teacher!

On the upside, the documentation is comprehensive and well-written. So, in conclusion; it works well and does what you advertise, but it could use some refining from a type snob. If you can do that, well, "Find My Font" could become genuinely indispensable for anyone who works with type. (wow!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the code.
After my first few minutes, I'd agree that this seems powerful though the interface could use some polish.
Three quick things I'd suggest fixing:
1) Make the Mac version application menu read "Find My Fonts" rather than "findmyfonts"
2) findmyfonts > Preferences > General, "Torelance" should be "Tolerance."
3) As I'm choosing letters and my selected bits are turning red, I like that Shift can add bits (an expected behavior) and the addition of the plus-sign to the cursor is also good feedback. But wouldn't it also make sense to keep the reddened parts of the letter red as I add to them?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi <strong>Craig</strong>,

I just send you the last promo-code,
and I 'l be glad to read your thoughts.

<strong>EDIT</strong>: I just show your comments
We will take care of (1) & (2) for sure.
We would also consider point (3) but it would have some side effects which are not easy to overcome.
Thank you for the feedback!




<strong>Alaskan</strong>,
I enjoyed every word of your comments and I'm really thankful for the time you spend on Find my Font.

There is no reason to worry that I 'll take anything personally. I'm old enough to have a good sense of humor and to know that a sincere constructive criticism is the best improvement tool for all things.
I assure you that I already forwarded all your comments to the ...kindergarten teachers! :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Good to hear you're not thin skinned, Fivos. That's a great characteristic to have in your business! 

Unfortunately, I've encountered some problems. The first odd behavior was bad; it would search for matching fonts, find a few (above an 80% match) then, when it was done searching, the window went blank. It showed the potential matches while searching...but once it's done, there's nothing listed. White space. I tested it on a font I own, so aside from the fact it found it while searching, I know there's a match.(BTW; is there a message to indicate "no matching fonts"?)

So, I decided to restart the application. As soon as I hovered over the "file" menu, I got a beach ball. It spun for about two minutes -- something that's <em>never once happened</em> on this computer before -- then, this:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/find-my-font-quit_6215.jpg]

Would you like me to send you the Mac-generated crash report details? I copied it into a text file just in case it's useful to you. I didn't send it to Apple. 

Good news: I restarted it, and it seems to be working again. I'll let you know if any more problems arise.

Yes, please send the generated report to us for further analysis. The easier way to send it is using the 'Help' -> 'License Information' -> 'e-mail To Support' which sends also some technical info about your O/S version etc.

Regarding your other question, no there is no such message as "no matching fonts", you just get a blank list.

About the behavior you describe, i.e. to see some matches which disappear latter, this is perfectly normal. Each search is performed in 2 phases: The first one is faster and may find some fonts which are then rearranged or discarded in phase 2 according to your preferences.
If you want to make the application less strict and keep more matches, go to 'Preferences' -> 'General' tab and move the 'Matching Accuracy' slider to the right (best matches - value: 100).
This may slow down a bit the matching operation but it will usually provide you with more font matches.

Thanks again for your valuable feedback.

		<div class="commentbody">Move the slider to the right for more results? If that's true, the "matching accuracy" slider is completely counter-intuitive. Looking at it, I thought sliding left would get more results, and to the right would get fewer (more accurate) results.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slider_5564.jpg]

I assumed "100" meant 100% accurate. That's one font. If I set it to "50" I assumed the results would show all fonts that matched 50%. 

In short, I assumed the opposite of what you're saying, and I'd be surprised if I was alone in that assumption. Perhaps the language needs adjusting? Because what you're saying isn't an "accuracy setting" it's actually <em>inaccuracy.</em> :)

This aside, it wasn't showing any results at any setting. I slid that thing back and forth about a dozen times trying to get a result; nothing. Now, using the exact same image, it shows accurate results at the default setting, and at any setting +20/-20 points.

FYI: It crashed again when I went to quit the program. I'll send the data as you've requested.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think your interpretation of Accuracy is a bit over-simplified at this context.
The number of matches to show is a different thing and can be set by the 'Max. Matches to Show' (bellow) and you can set it to 1 if you wish to see only the top match.

The 'Matching Accuracy' factor is just an easy way to let the user control Accuracy vs Speed and yes it will finally deliver more accurate results (not less results but more accurate in general) because there will be more candidate fonts to examine in phase 2.
If you still feel that the term 'Accuracy' is counter-intuitive I'm open to suggestions but I don't thing 'inaccuracy' is a term that can be used.
Maybe we 'll just change the limit-names to "max speed" and "more matches" and that's enough...

In the next paragraph you lost me a bit... Did you finally get a result or not?
Because you say "it wasn't showing any results at any setting" and then you say "it shows accurate results at the default setting, and at any setting +20/-20 points" and this sounds like a contradiction to me.

I will be really surprised to find out that the application is not working with a single specific font, because we tested it with many hundreds of thousands fonts.
Can you attach a screen capture of the application screen to understand the font you are using and the selection you have made when you get no results?
If this is not possible due to image size, please send me a screen capture by e-mail.

It's both very strange & very interesting, because this is actually the first crash report ever received from either a customer or a beta tester.

No the restart can't change the matching ability, it just resets the state of the application.
More than this, I tested the image you provided above and in my machine Find my Font correctly identify the font at any setting (is always the top match out of 200.000 fonts) by selecting just 2 letters: 'Ne'

Could you please attach a screen-capture of the Application screen having no matches?
It's important to see how you selected the letters and how many letters you selected.

On the other hand, I don't know if all these details are so interesting to the other typophile users here, therefore you can send me the screenshot by e-mail and I could post here the final results of my investigation.

Thank you

PS - A hint: You don't have to select more than 1-3 logo letters for an accurate match. Just try to select the most unique letters of the logo and put the rest letters only to 'Text To Display' to see how well the match went.

		<div class="commentbody">This is certainly an impressive application, and it's proven already that it's highly capable in performing the task it's developed to do. I'll bite and say what has made me a little queasy about this from the start: I wish this wasn't an installable app that uses local fonts. I would really like to see this, as some others have said, as an online service connected to databases of major vendors. That would be so much more helpful.

Using locally installed fonts, I have to admit that to me for instance this would be of very limited use since I only have a limited set of (licenced) fonts installed, and the ones I have I usually know what they look like (since I also paid for them, or selected them carefully from free stuff, or was given them by their designers, etc). So frankly for me the whole concept seems kind of besides the point, since the fonts I'd usually be looking for would be ones I <em>don't</em> have installed. Is it just me?</div>

As the others have said, it would be extremely useful to plug it into the databases of type distributors, as well as find local font files. I do see the second function as highly useful too as I don't always remember the fonts installed by default with the OS (Like Nina I tend to use only the ones I've licensed or been given), and I know publishers/design agencies that have thousands of font files scattered haphazardly around their networks. (Does it search networks too?)

ok if you ever be able to repeat the behavior, please sent me a screenshot.
About the crash when you shutdown, it must be something related to your system (You O/S, a strange combination with other Apps installed, etc).
If the report you already sent me, it's not from a shutdown crash, please send me also a shutdown crash report.
Thank you!


<strong>Nina</strong>
I fully understand your point, but -judging from your comments in the Id forum- you are a very experienced designer, able to recognize every single font you own. This is not always the case. 

Consider for example the case of a not-so-experienced designer, or a designer working for a big company which has purchased -though the years- a huge collection of thousand of fonts. In such cases, there is no single person in the company able to recall all typefaces of the company's collection.
Actually the first versions of the Find my Font were designed as an internal tool for 2 companies having this specific need.

That said, I already mention that we understand the need to identify also fonts that you don't have, and we examine the best option of how to implement this functionality, while you will still be able to search your own fonts.

Thank you for your thoughts
Fivos

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Hi Ben</strong>,

about the possibility of searching distributor databases in the future, see my answer to Nina above, and you can see also my answer in previous page about the ways this can be implemented (e.g. downloadable font libraries, having only the information needed for matching and not the actual fonts).

<blockquote>One final question: how good is it at recognising photographs of text, which may have some perspective, slant, distortion or squooshing?</blockquote>

The current version recognizes just italic & bold variations by creating an artificial Oblique or artificial Bold typeface based on your original font file.
You can also rotate the whole image, horizontalize the text baseline, or split connected script letters.

For the future we plan to add some new tools to recognize artificially expanded or condensed letters or letters slanted to the left (reverse italic?) but these are not yet included in the current distribution.

Fivos

PS: I missed one of your questions: Yes it can also search in any network location you have access from your computer. You can specify either a local directory or a network location as a new discreet 'FontSet' which you may also switch on/off in every match you perform.</div>

Granted, that makes a lot of sense. I think what makes me unhappy is that outside of such a scenario, it seems to assume – or even gently encourage – a «collector» mentality (the more fonts you have, the more you can ID!) – which I'm not sure is a good thing, also ideologically if you will. But maybe it's just me, or I'm misunderstanding something, etc.

<cite>&gt; «(e.g. downloadable font libraries, having only the information needed for matching and not the actual fonts)»</cite>

This sounds interesting. In case you can share, what sort of «information» would this need to be? Perhaps just outlines of a few key glyphs?

BTW, I really wouldn't call myself «very experienced» (thanks tho), I'm just a typenut.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Nina</strong> I fully understand your concerns, but it's not the collector mentality that I personally fear the most.

If somebody has the moral strength and the maturity to respect the work of others, he will do it anyway, by checking every time if a font he/she downloaded from a (supposed) "free fonts" site is really free, or there is actually a commercial license to be acquired before using it in a project.

On the other side, I suppose that many people are searching for a font using e.g. the WhatTheFont service and then they download the matching font from other illegitimate sources and sites.
The later I'm sure they will do exactly the same, even if we provide them with downloadable Find my Font libraries.
They will also do the same with our software: Instead of buying Find my Font, they will try to find an illegitimate cracked version of it.

What I'm trying to say is that Find my Font is just another tool and every good or bad usage of a tool depends -finally- on the wisdom, maturity and ethics of each user.

<blockquote>This sounds interesting. In case you can share, what sort of «information» would this need to be? Perhaps just outlines of a few key glyphs?</blockquote>

I can't say much because I don't want to accidentally reveal any details about our matching algorithm but I can say this:
a) All glyphs must be present in the library because we don't know in advance which glyphs a user may select for matching or preview
b) The glyph outlines are not required; a low resolution bitmap image should be sufficient for a small-size preview. This way a font vendor can be sure that there is no way for anyone to acquire the original outline font data from our libraries.

At this point I need to repeat that, we haven't yet decided how we will implement the feature of non-local fonts matching (it can be downloadable libraries, but it can be as well a connection to a remote server) and we also cannot promise yet any release date for this feature.

Thank you for your thoughts


<strong>Bob</strong>, 
you are so right! Even I, which I have zero background on font-design and a highly untrained eye, I have come to realize that there can be so many small variations based on each font designer decisions, that is almost impossible to visually remember all the details and differences between 2 similar fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ben,

although at the last messages we all talk about Font-Libraries etc,
you should consider that the primary purpose of Find my Font, 
is to match an image against local fonts on your computer.
This is not possible -or at least it would be much more difficult and very slow-
if  the application is offered <strong>only</strong> as a web service.

More than this, I don't think anybody will be willing to pay for such a service when he can use instead e.g. WhatTheFont or your excellent ID forum here in Typophile.

An alternative is to offer both:
(a) Find my Font (for local fonts) + connection to a web-service (for vendor fonts)
(b) An independent payed iPhone application (vendor fonts only)

..but that's another story, and only the future can show us if there is a market big enough to support the developing of such applications.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">At last I’m adding my two cents about the tool.
They’re pretty random observations and I’m sorry if they overlaps with the ones of others.
1. First thing, since it is aimed at professional users, which most probably use some font management software or another, Find My Font should, upon the first launch, ask the user where they keep their font files. And/or ask if they would like the app to scan their drives for font files.
2. I like the single window approach, I find the numbers between parentheses (used to order the steps) distracting. They should at least be replaced by more graphic elements or, better yet, with a different solution (maybe disabling input on the not ready yet steps and/or highlighting the current step).
3. Some kind of auto-discovering/guess of shapes would be welcome.
4. Some of the common behaviours I’m missing are:
- Click and drag to zoom a portion of the image (with the auto-guess thing it would be useful a click and drag selection too).
- Command-z to undo.
- In the Finder, the ability of right click on a image file and have Find My Font on the list of "Open with…" apps.
5. The tooltips on the icons show the Windows keyboard shortcuts even in the Mac version (and Command-s is always used for Save, so it’s a bit confusing having it for Screenshot).
6. Adjustable/moveable letter splitters would be a nice addition.

That’s the main of it :-)

<blockquote>3. Some kind of auto-discovering/guess of shapes would be welcome.</blockquote>
Do you mean e.g. to drag a rectangle and (if the image has a simple background) to automatically select the letters?
...or do you mean something different? 

<blockquote>4. Some of the common behaviours I’m missing are:
- Click and drag to zoom a portion of the image </blockquote>
You can zoom in/out using the mouse wheel.
Did you miss this functionality or do you think a more precise rectangle-based zoom tool is required?

You have an eye for the detail for sure, and all of your observations are very valuable and welcome.

Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">About auto-discovering/guess of shapes: yes, exactly.

About zoom: yes, I think a rectangle based zoom would be useful (also note that Apple's mice don't have a scroll wheel).

Glad to have been of some service.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, but since it doesn’t always work the same as a physical scroll-wheel for zooming (for example, in Flash), I’m used to think of this feature as a Windows thing ;-)
Also, rectangle selection to zoom is more precise.
That said, I’ve now tested the scroll gesture in Find My Font and indeed it works very well.</div>
