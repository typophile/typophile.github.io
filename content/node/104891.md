body: "Reasons for this project:\r\n\r\n[k/K letter is this shape \u0915/\u0915]\r\n\r\nI
  would not li\u0915e to purchase my meditation chanting beads from a compromised
  Hare \u0915rishna  temple who are under a coup and usurper regime here in England
  since November 14th 1977.  The meditation chanting beads process basically is  to
  chant  the prayer for deliverance in this Age or the Hare \u0915rishna Maha-mantra
  at least minimum of 16 rounds, each round composed of 108  meditation chanting beads
  on a daily basis:  \r\n\r\nHare \u0915rishna Hare \u0915rishna \r\n\u0915rishna
  \u0915rishna \r\nHare Hare \r\nHare Rama Hare Rama \r\nRama Rama \r\nHare Hare \r\n\r\nAlso
  there are scenarios where showing my meditation chanting beads and/or audibly chanting
  so someone is able to hear would not be possible and thus meditation chanting sans
  the beads would have to be done \u2018informally.\u2019  Although tic\u0915ing with
  a pen on paper to \u0915eep trac\u0915 of the meditation chanting sans the beads,
  for example, 1 to 50 numbered areas on Boards A to E on \u2018Euro lottery\u2019
  printed slips   issued by the lottery company, Camelot (Britain) albeit not using
  \r\nfor playing the lottery i.e not  for gambling purposes,  is a tool-solution
  in certain circumstances, see:\r\n\r\nHTML for Websites\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2jcdeu8\"

  I also have a preference for a customised solution for other scenarios, for example,
  \u2018formal\u2019 meditation chanting beads scenario (at least minimum of 16 rounds,
  each round composed of 108  meditation chanting beads on a daily basis)  therefore
  this RFQ:  Request For Quotation -  Graphic Design project.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject itself:\r\n\r\n1.
  \ On a piece of paper 109 circles from large to small connected together as if on
  a chain and bound together at each end, thus 109 circles in a circle.  \r\n\r\n2.
  \ The 1st circle and the 108th circle are faintly labelled 1 to 108 on the outside
  of the circle and really are from large to small.  They are faintly labelled 1 to
  108 from each end, so they are 2 numbers for each circle, for example, 1st circle
  is labelled 1/108 and the 108th circle is labelled 108/1.  Probably having the 1st
  number labelled faintly on outside at the top end of each circle and the 2nd number
  faintly labelled at the lower end also outside the actual circle is the solution.
  \ The reason for 2 numbers labelled for each circle is because the meditation chanting
  beads process is to reverse at each end rather than jump-over the 109th circle.
  \ \r\n\r\n3.  From 1st to 108th circle, each circle is to be divided with 4 vertical
  lines and 4 horizontal lines or is 4x4 with 16 identifiable intersections on each
  circle, due to meditation chanting beads process, that could be mar\u0915ed by me
  whilst chanting providing a reference location and also would be useful if I am
  interrupted away from the meditation.\r\n\r\n4.  The project should fit a sheet
  of ordinary computer printed paper, for example, in Britain the standard computer
  printer paper size is A4.  Thus due to size limitations the 109 circle in a circle
  might require an inner or outer loop.  The final output should be on a PDF file.
  \ \r\n\r\n5.  The 109th circle should not be intersected or labelled, simply shaded
  with more of a coo\u0915ing pot shape rather than a circle shape with some bushy
  hairy top / as if the coo\u0915ing pot is boiling and overflowing."
