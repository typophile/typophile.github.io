      preview the OSF or small caps, but I think that's what was used."

  body: Guerella, Eric, you're right. It is Apex Serif small caps and Oldstyle figures,
    with the 6 baseline shifted down. (This work was done by 2x4, and I have some
    print samples...)

    body: chester, thanks for the details. I've been on the lookout for a nice slab
      with all the OpenType trimmings for awhile now. Apex may just do the trick...

  body: 'Eric, thanks. The font works best at lighter weights. That is to say: the
    heavy weights are pretty poor. (I was younger and my chops were not what they
    could have been.) The Book weight specifically is quite good. At some point, if
    there is demand and interest, I will revise the font family, and do better. (The
    same applies for Apex Sans, which is presently undergoing a serious and necessary
    revision, and is going to be MUCH better...)'

  body: "I think the problem with the heavier weights of Apex is that it attempts
    to remain truly monoline, and keep the weight of that monoline the same for all
    characters. So the heavy weights suffer from the lack of optical compensation
    at stroke intersections, and not doing lighter strokes in characters with a high
    stroke density.\r\n\r\nI like the underlying design and the lighter weights, though,
    and I am sure that Chester could salvage the heavier weights with a bit more work.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks for all the extra Apex info. I agree about the chubbier weights, but
    the Book weight seems quite nice. (Similar in flavor, but not as ubiquitous as
    PMN Caecilia\u2014I blame <em>Real Simple</em>.)\r\n\r\nI'll be keeping an eye
    out for future revisions..."
