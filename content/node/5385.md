  body: It&#39;s a goofy old digital font called <a href="http://www.masterstech-home.com/The_Library/Font_Samples/Font_Indices/Image_Pages/B/BlackChancery.html"
    target="_blank">Black Chancery</a>. It looks like they&#39;ve added several strokes
    to it with very high values for the miter limit.
