body: 'Hi there, masters. <BR>I am stick with problem generating ExtraLight TT font
  for Windows. <BR> <BR>Background: Local branch of global Co receives corporate font,
  designed specially for them elsewere. <BR>There are Mac &amp; PC versions, Mac PS1
  have 8 members, from &#42;ExtraLight to &#42;Black. <BR>PC TT versions has only
  6 - &#42;ExtraLight and &#42;Black are missing. <BR> <BR>Converted TT to WinXP &#40;TransType,
  OS9 3-day demo&#41;. Opened, inspected and generated &#42;ExtraLight in FL4.6 as
  Windows TT, font shows up in Font listings as expected, prints as expected BUT on
  screen &#40;in OpenOffice, WordPad&#41; looks very weird -- like baddly generated
  bold or something like that. Strangely, but in CorelDraw 11 its OK. <BR> <BR>The
  catch is -- when doing the same MacPS1-WinTT conversion &#40;as experiment&#41;
  with &#42;Light version, it looks good in same conditions. <BR> <BR>Inspected outlines
  in FL, compared font settings ... nothing shows up. All settings &#40;except weight
  differences and naming, of course&#41; looks the same. But &#42;ExtraLight shows
  weird, prints good. <BR>Same with straight TransType generated Win TrueTupes for
  both -- same result -- &#42;Light TT on WinXP OpenOffice looks good, &#42;ExtraLight
  -- weird. Much to say, &#42;ExtraLight source PS1 on Mac is perfect, both outlines
  and bitmap part. <BR>Question is -- may be ExtraLigts on Win needs some special
  knowledge to get correct screen representations? <BR>&#40;I&#39;m wondering that
  foreign designers who designed that font had the same problem -- that&#39;s why
  ExtraLight is missing on Windows side ... :-&#41;'

  body: 'You are correct. <BR> <BR>This is a fairly well-known and understood problem.
    Technically, it is an application bug, but it is present in many, many applications
    - half or more of all Windows applications last time Adobe tested this, which
    admittedly was years ago. <BR> <BR>Your ExtraLight font has a WeightClass of 200,
    because that&#39;s what the Win TrueType and OpenType specs say an ExtraLight
    font should have. <BR> <BR>The problem is that many applications assume that all
    fonts have a weightclass of 400 for the &#34;regular&#34; font and 700 for a style-linked
    &#34;bold&#34; font in a given family. <BR> <BR>So the app knows the name of the
    font, and assumes that the right WeightClass is 400. So it asks Windows to give
    it that font with a WeightClass of 400. The only one Windows can find has a WeightClass
    of 200, but Windows thinks a faux bold &#40;smeared bold&#41; is 300 more than
    that. 500 is closer to 400 than 200 is. So Windows promptly gives the bad app
    a faux bold &#40;smeared&#41; version of the font. PostScript devices will probably
    print this correctly, but it will be bold onscreen and if printed to a GDI device.
    <BR> <BR>Adobe encountered this problem early in OpenType development. Our workaround
    has been to use WeightClass values in between 250 and 300 for very light weights
    &#40;250 or more doesn&#39;t raise the problem&#41;. <BR> <BR>There are some other
    complications that you can run into to do with specific WeightClass values combined
    with style links, but that&#39;s much more complex. You can find fully detailed
    information that I wrote up in the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType &#40;FDK&#41;.
