  thread about the tonos.\r\n\r\nMy question is...Is there any good reason to make
  the angle of the tonos steeper in monotonic Greek than the acute accent (especially
  if an acute is quite steep anyway)?\r\n\r\nI can see the merit in making it steeper
  for the upper case vowels in which the tonos appears upper left aligned with the
  cap height but what other reason is there for making it steeper than the acute (when
  in law the tonos is to all intents and purposes equivalent to an acute?)\r\n\r\nJohn
  Hudson wrote: \"it tends to be steep and often taller than the Latin acute\". Any
  reason why?\r\n\r\nI understand that you might want a steeper tonos/oxia in polytonic
  where space above a letter may be at a premium but why does it always seem to be
  steeper than the acute in monotonic Greek where there's all the room in the world
  (particularly over the lower case vowels)?\r\n\r\nN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the natural thing for Greek readers would be to have it \"look like a tonos\"
    in monotonic Greek as well.\r\n\r\nMaking it look like an acute accent is a bad
    thing that would be distracting to the reader.\r\n\r\nGiven that it appears before
    the letter, rather than above the letter, with upper-case letters, the main reason
    for having a shallower angle does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that an
    acute accent in French, for example, turns a short vowel into a long one. The
    tonos, on the other hand, indicates the stressed vowel in a word. Introductory
    Russian textbooks sometimes use a similar mark to indicate the stressed vowel
    in Russian words, because of the strong effect this has on pronunciation - stress
    basically turning a schwa into a non-schwa.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the effect
    of stress on vowel quality in Greek, but even if there is a significant effect,
    the vowel in question not simply becoming louder, stressing a syllable is psychologically
    something very different than the long-short change in vowel quality (often signaled
    in Greek, as in English, by the use of dipthongs in spelling).\r\n\r\nSo I suspect
    many Greeks would loudly say, \"don't fool with our stress marks to make them
    look like your accent marks\"."

    you are making an assumption that a tonos looks different from an acute but you're
    not telling me why it <em>is</em> different. \r\n\r\nI know it has its own codepoint
    but so do Alpha and A and yet you could substitute the A for Alpha (and nearly
    everyone does) and even the X and Chi although these are completely different
    sounds...\r\n\r\nWhy is the advice, make the tonos steeper and different?\r\n\r\nN"

    that is what Greeks expect to read.  Would you make an acute steeper just to match
    the tonos? Just because there are more languages that use acute than tonos does
    not mean one can replace the other. I almost never sub the A for Alpha or X for
    Chi, or P for Rho.  I see no need to or even an advantage. Would you ask Cyrillic
    readers to flop their glyph to look like an R just because Latin scripts do it
    that way?  A glyph is what it is, not what is most expedient for the type designer
    to save some time."

    angles in different typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe reason the tonos is traditionally steep
    may be, as John notes, to take up less horizontal space when preceding capitals,
    and also when combining with psili and dasia, but in those combo accents, there
    is no need for it (oxia/varia) to be the same angle as a plain tonos.\r\n\r\n"

    say, Stymie Bold, for Greek, they could make the tonos look like anything they
    wanted.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion - and, not being Greek, I admit I could be completely
    off base on it - is that accents can be thought of as hats worn by vowels to give
    them a distinctive personality. Thus, think of \xE1 as an a wearing a fedora with
    a feather in it, of \xE2 as an a wearing a conical party hat...\r\n\r\nBut a <em>tonos</em>
    is an arrow pointing down at the vowel from above, singling it out as the stressed
    one... while it is still the <em>same</em> vowel.\r\n\r\nSo, psychologically,
    a tonos isn't thought of as an \"accent\" as such, and thus making it typographically
    similar to an acute accent would arouse ill-feelings of foreigners trying to tamper
    with their language and the like."

    not about to make my acute steeper to match my tonos, but my question now is,
    should the tonos <em>match</em> the acute or is that in some way offensive (which

    of ignorance. What I'm saying is I don't know what a tonos should look like because
    I am not a Greek speaker/reader, much as I love Greek letters. I certainly want

    a tonos?  How would you proceed? I guess I am saying is, why do you even think
    the two marks should be the same? I am not discounting, their similarity, I am
    just trying to get at your reasoning. A typeface is a system of glyphs that should
    be harmonious together in writing text of whatever language is intended.  The
    first order of harmony is within each script if you have more than one included.
    \ In other words \"when in Rome...\"\r\n\r\nGranted, history has thrown a monkey
    wrench into this. There was a time, after the Ottoman's conquered Greece and even
    thereafter, when finding Greek type was difficult.  This is especially true of
    Latin scholars who wanted to print Greek words accurately in their books. There
    was a choice between leaving it out or trying to make do with what was available
    (including borrowed diacritics).  What else could they do? There were several
    non-Greeks who, thankfully, wanted to preserve the classic Greek writings as important
    literature, philosophy, science, and history.  Thanks to them and with the help
    of some native Greeks, types began to come out in Greek but hand cut punches were
    a daunting task and were time consuming.\r\nToday, it is a different story.  There
    is no technological, political, economic, or sociological problem  standing in
    the way of producing Greek type easily. \r\nAgain, ask yourself your own question
    but also ask what would the purpose be to homogenize diacritics?  Why not then
    change them all to reduce the number in some abstract amount? Make the grave,
    tonos, acute, kreska, as well as comma, apostrophe and inch, a single vertical
    straight line?  You might say it would confuse the reader and I would agree.\r\n\r\nChris"

    that the accent <em>is</em> an acute. I wondered why the de facto accent used
    is generally steeper than the de jure acute. Is it as simple as the accent used
    before the upper case vowels was compressed and this compressed version was then
    used above the lower case vowels or is there more to it?"

    a Greek diacritic mark :-)\r\n\r\nIn the old days of the 1980s, 8 bit was the
    limit so they had to make room somehow.  The funny thing is, by the time they
    acted on what do do with 8 bit, Unicode had come out making room not only for
    ploytonic Greek but numerous more demanding scripts as well.\r\nI have seen older
    writing that says the Monotonic Greek tonos, replaces the \"oxia\" and it's grave-like
    partner, as well as the tilde looking \"Perispomeni\" and is simplified to be
    just an accent denoting where the emphasis should be. I do not interpret this
    as looking exactly like the Latin acute necessarily but just reducing the number
    to one. Since there is still quite a bit of Greek published in polytonic yet today,
    it seems odd to have a discussion in a time when the bit depth has been well eclipsed.

    as your smiley indicates.\r\n\r\nBy the way, a while back I ran across a web site
    by a Greek who feels that it's a sad thing that the days of polytonic Greek are
    over: the [[http://www.polytoniko.org/index.php?newlang=en|homepage]] of the Citizens'
    Movement for the Reintroduction of the Polytonic System.\r\n\r\nOf course, this
    represents the views of one individual, not necessarily mainstream Greek public
    opinion. Since the various marks now simply indicate the stressed vowel, which
    behaves the same way no matter what symbol was used to indicate this, at least
    for writing modern Greek, it would seem the current monotonic system is less confusing.
    (Reading the site, I see his argument for keeping polytonic Greek is analogous
    to how someone would argue for keeping the existing spelling of the English language,
    as opposed to changing to a phonetic spelling - the differing accents help to
    make the grammatical elements of the language clear, just as different spellings
    for vowels, now pronounced the same, help with etymology.)\r\n\r\nBut since Greek
    is a language with a rich past, the ability to accurately quote older texts will
    remain highly important; I think it's still strongly recommended that people designing
    Greek typefaces include full polytonic capabilities in their fonts."

    spoken in rural areas of Greece. (His other major literary works in Greek were
    written in dimotiki with influence from the Cretan dialect, which was controversial
    at the time.)\r\n\r\nApparently, this made it hard for people to read... so, while
    Greece also had katharevousa, no one has, to my knowledge, suggested going beyond
    the classical literature to the rural dialects to attempt to more fully reconstruct
    the full Greek language... and produce Greece's answer to <em>nynorsk</em>. For
    which most Greeks are no doubt thankful.\r\n\r\nApparently, I misunderstood what
    I read. It included a glossary at the end of words used by ordinary Greeks, but

    to indicate that it is not an unstressed or silent e. It is not used on any other
    letter, and the French \xE9 is a short sound. Languages where the acute accent

    The French \xE9 has the sound of long A. But I take it you don't mean the same
    thing as I do by a \"long vowel\", since \"not simply long versions of the short
    vowels\" apparently means that you are thinking of a long vowel in terms of duration,
    rather than vowel quality.\r\n\r\nThere are languages - I think Japanese is one
    - about which the term \"long vowel\" is used in this manner, because vowel duration
    contrasts exist and are significant.\r\n\r\nEnglish doesn't have that sort of
    thing at all, and, thus, the normal use of the term \"long vowel\" in English
    means... A as in cave, instead of A as in cat; E as in be, instead of E as in
    bet; I as in ivy, instead of I as in tin; O as in open, instead of O as in cot;
    U as in puny, instead of U as in push... and so on.\r\n\r\nIt's strictly a distinction
    of vowel quality, and not at all of duration."

    in vowels has largely disappeared in Modern French, except for some speakers who
    distinguish the open E sounds in ma\xEEtre (long) and mettre (short). There is
    some automatic lengthening of certain vowels due to position, but the \xE9 vowel
    does not usually occur in such contexts. See [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_phonology#Length|the
    Wikipedia article]] for more detail. Quebec French makes more of a difference
    in pronunciation between long vowels and short vowels so it's easier to tell that
    the \xE9 vowel is short when you listen to that variety of French.\r\n\r\nThe
    French \xE9 vowel is mapped to the English long A only because of the similarity
    in quality, so this says nothing about whether the French vowel is long or short.\r\n\r\nOnce
    upon a time, English long vowels and short vowels were distinguished by duration,
    not quality. The Great Vowel Shift and subsequent sound changes altered the vowel
    qualities so that for example long A as in cave doesn't match the quality of short
    A as in cat. But in Standard British English, for example, the long vowels are
    still appreciably longer than the short vowels. It is only in certain varieties
    like North American English that the quantity distinction has become less important
    so that speakers might think of the long-short distinction exclusively as one
    of quality."
