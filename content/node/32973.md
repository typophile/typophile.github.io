  [[Achaz Reuss]], 1995-2002\r\n\r\nAfter re-working and expanding OCR-B to include
  three weights for the [[FontFont]] 14 release (FF OCR-F), Pool began working on
  his second FontFont, the famous [[DIN Mittelschrift]]. This face has not only dominated
  the traffic signs and public buildings in Germany, but with its technical orientation
  and straightforwardness it has also found many friends internationally. FF DIN has
  been expanded to a family of five weights. For each weight there is an Alternate
  cut with old style figures, circular i-dots and full points and oblique terminals
  on some characters.\r\n\r\nPool himself considers DIN Mittelschrift -- the German
  \"Autobahn\" typeface -- to be \"probably the most non-designed typeface ever made\".
  Taking this opinion as a starting point it seemed to be logical to only enhance
  the typographic quality of the design while maintaining its overall appearance.
  The original DIN Mittelschrift is built up from strokes having a constant thickness,
  all curves being drawn with a compass. This provides a spotty typeface with quirky
  letterforms, as can especially seen in the characters a, e and s. Compared with
  characters with fewer strokes, such as b, d, p, q, and o and n they appear rather
  black. For FF DIN, the weight of the horizontal strokes has been reduced, and the
  curves were designed in a more fluent way. The medium weight of FF DIN resembles
  the original weight of DIN Mittelschrift. Using it for reading text in smaller point
  sizes gives a rather dark appearance. The weight scheme for FF DIN was conceived
  to accommodate the addition of a new and lighter \"regular\" version. Each of the
  weights has been provided with over 700 kerning pairs, including those with international
  accents. With FF DIN, designers can now use the image and impact of a typeface family
  relating to items as \"traffic\", \"engineering\" and the German \"Wirtschaftswunder\".
  It is left to each designer to determine how much the original typeface retains
  its character, as they can now opt for new weights or the alternate fonts that have
  friendly circular i-dots and old style figures. \r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
