    no time right now, so I want to apologize for my lack of input on this one. <BR>

  body: 'I can&#39;t find it anywhere on MyFonts, and unfortunately I don&#39;t have
    time to look further. However, I found something fairly close, at least along
    the lines of its elegance and low x-height: Coronet. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/coronet-i/">URW&#39;s
    version</a> is a little heavier than <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/coronet-rr/">Red
    Rooster&#39;s light version</a>,  though RR has a heavier weight, too.'
