  body: Well, you could come up with something recognizable for the fun of it, but
    it would only be of any use when setting (or writing???) all-caps cursive, which
    is a monstrosity.

  body: Right; I was more interested in what it would look like and didn't really
    think it through.

  body: "A hypo-theoretical italic small cap \u201CEszett\u201D \xDF would however
    mimic a hypo-theoretical italic cap Eszett. Some people here in the forum expressed
    that they wouldn't buy a font without italic small caps, [[http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=italic+small-caps+site%3Atypophile.com#hl=de&q=italic+small*caps+site:typophile.com&pbx=1&oq=italic+small*caps+site:typophile.com&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=1672l2471l0l4141l2l2l0l0l0l0l452l820l3-1.1l2l0&fp=1&biw=1229&bih=706&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&cad=b|as

    caps Eszett is \u201Cmissing\u201D? Put into context, italic small caps would
    be necessary for acronyms maybe. As of 2011 I think it would be an exotic glyph,
    and the idea is already two steps ahead of the current use, as the people who
    even heard of the Eszett cap in the first place are few, but why not being two
    steps ahead? "

  body: "Offhand, I don't recall any types with cursive (joined) capitals.\r\nBut
    if we're talking about discrete swash capitals, first, you have to have a typeface
    where the swash caps have been designed for all-cap setting, not just as initials.\r\nI've
    done a few such types: FF Oneleigh Pro, Scotch Modern, and FF Fontesque Pro (top
    to bottom)\u2014\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eszetts_5941.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    Oneleigh, I was able to come up with a unique swash form for the cap eszett, but
    didn't think it would be merited for the more demure swash caps of the Scotch
    Modern, where the default Eszett already had the ball terminal which is the primary
    feature of the swash caps. In Fontesque, the default caps are somewhat swashy\u2014I
    suppose I could have come up with something special for the cap eszett, but found
    it easier to adapt the Oneleigh Italic glyph.\r\n\r\nI haven't produced swash
    small caps for any faces."

  body: Thank you, everyone, for your input, even if the question was a bit odd to
    start with. I originally asked the question with a Spencerian script in mind;
    I didn't bother to ask myself why one would use such a character. But the all-caps
    swash styles are fairly close to what I had in mind, and certainly more practical.
