  I can&#39;t remember which were the  <BR>faces I used. One thing I know for sure
  is they&#39;re  <BR>freeware fonts. I think this one&#39;s up Cheshire&#39;s alley.

  body: Eduardo Recife&#39;s Porcelain is one of them. &#40;the script one.&#41; I
    know because we happened to design quite similar fonts at the same time without
    having ever seen each others work... <BR>could the number be &#39;Crash numerals&#39;
    or something by, ehhh, psyops or p22... Can&#39;t remember. Brain heating up...  <BR>

    around? I really like the aesthetics of it, especially  <BR>his treated scripts.

  body: Thanks, Yves and everyone! I know it&#39;s difficult to fathom, but I actually
    managed to be away from my computer on my birthday -- I was out on a boat off
    the coast of Monterey &#40;California&#41;, watching the grey whale and Risso&#39;s
    dolphin migration. Lovely way to spend a birthday. And this is a great way to
    spend my day-after-birthday. Thanks again.
