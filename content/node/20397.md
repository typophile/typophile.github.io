  \ Is there a way to easily distinquish between the two formats?  Ideally, I'd love
  a utility(, script or something) to process a folder of font files and separate
  them into Mac and PC folders.  Short of that, I'd take a report, or even a way to
  manually determine by checking individual files.\r\n\r\nThanks..."

  body: For the most part, you can probably tell the Windows fonts from the Mac fonts
    just by the ".ttf" extension. Windows TrueType fonts always have this extension.
    On OS X,  the Mac fonts will be listed as "Font Suitcase" in the Finder and will
    have the letters "FFIL" on the icon. In OS 9 and earlier, the icon will look like
    a little suitcase. If you copy the Mac fonts to a PC, the files will be empty
    and the fonts will not be useable since Mac font suitcases have a file structure
    that Windows does not recognize.
