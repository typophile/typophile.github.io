    dei caratteri\".\r\n\r\nGreat post. :=)"

    words for the same kind of statement. Once I also believed that the history of
    typography could be separated from the history of writing simply because this
    was the history written by learned men in famous book.

    is the name which has been used as long as we had printed specimens, I did not
    propose a theoretical name.\r\nIf you use \"specimen\" side by side of \"caratteri\"
    on Google you get more results, but if you use \"campionario\", you get less,
    but more relevant.\r\nOf course, the English term has become more common use as
    in the last 10 years more Italian people started to get involved in type design,
    but the English term does not make a substitute per se.\r\n\r\nI have never thought
    history of typography could be separated from the history of writing, where did
    you get the idea when you believed so?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Of course, \"specimen\" is
    Latin, but in this specifical meaning is an English adoption. In Italian it seems
    it's used mostly as a biology (or medicine) term."

    in this.\r\nYou're right, however, about \"campionario\", it's more a commercial
    term and it probably emerged in the early 1900s, after the industrial revolution.
    But it seems quite a good explanatory term in Italian to me, for this purpose.
    Actually \"serie\" would be almost an appropriate translation for \"Font\" (a
    specific style, weight and size). Of course, \"serie\" is also the weight/variant
    only.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the translations\u2026 :=)"

    it took on commercial attributes after WWI (as Nebiolo started its studio, in
    the early 1930s the first specimens start using \"serie\" consistently: serie
    nera, serie chiara, etc\u2026)\r\n\r\nI'm beginning to understand the subtleties
    of these terminologies right now, researching the roots of many Nebiolo \"clones\"
    of German types."
