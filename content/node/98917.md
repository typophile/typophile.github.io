  body: "[[http://www.typophile.com/node/87088|Previously asked]] but still unresolved.\r\nNot
    sure it is a commercial typeface, more a bespoke typeface exclusively done for
    this project. Only top finials are rounded and don't know any typeface like this
    one. It looks like a variation on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic/|Alternate
    Gothic]]: top half part manually rounded and some finials reworked. Your best
    chance is probably to ask directly [[http://www.brucemaudesign.com|Bruce Mau]].\r\nMore

    part of the team on this project but do know that it was in fact a bespoke typeface
    specifically drawn for \xA1Guateamala! It was a combination of faces bred together
    (although Alternate Gothic looks like it would have worked well too!). Hope that
    helps..."
