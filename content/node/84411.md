  redesign. Unfortunately it was done about 6 years ago and the original designer
  is nowhere to be found. The text was rasterized and turned into an image and I cannot
  find a site that recognizes it. Any and all help is greatly appreciated, and thank
  you in advance.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/counterculture_4144.PNG]"
