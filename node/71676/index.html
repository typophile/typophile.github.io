  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I&rsquo;m designing &amp; typesetting a book in Newzald; and some Greek terms have come up. At first I was reasonably OK with Georgia:
<img src="/images/old-images/Griechisch_Georgia_4261.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d love to find something that matches Newzald better, especially the color/weight. Plus, it turns out there&rsquo;s some more Greek in a different text, in which [at least my version of] Georgia can&rsquo;t display all characters. I&rsquo;m assuming this is Polytonic Greek?
Using Lucida Grande:
<img src="/images/old-images/Griechisch_Screenshot_4442.gif" alt="">
.
There is not a lot of Greek, but I&rsquo;d really like it to not be too jarring. 
Can anyone point me towards a font that supports Polytonic Greek, would work with Newzald (think Fleischmann/Rosart, Transitional, narrowish vertical, relatively dark) and if possible doesn&rsquo;t cost an arm and a leg? I only need regular weight, but with italics.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

Monotonic only has the tonos (looks like acute accent) and the occasional dieresis.</p>

Constantia looks «not bad», formally – is there a Polytonic version? I can&rsquo;t seem to find it.</p>
<p>The GFS fonts (of which I tried the «Didot» and the «Bodoni») look like they&rsquo;d be quite nice as standalone fonts, but they don&rsquo;t blend in with the existing Latin too well. Andron is probably over the budget in this case, and it might also be a bit too light and a bit too «oldstyle» in the setting I have – if I used that, I&rsquo;d really prefer to use it within its own Latin.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m realizing is that I need the Greek to be rather subordinate to the Latin in this case, so actually not too «traditional» – both in terms of blending in (there is very little Greek, and the Latin should be allowed to set the tone so to speak), and also in terms of not being too italic/cursive-looking when upright. 
I need Roman+Italic to be rather distinct (I&rsquo;m dealing with situations like in the Latin within the top screenshot above, which is from a transcription of a manuscript, where italicization (even inside words) carries extra meaning).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have Arno (I skipped CS3, which IIRC it was included with). Looking at it, it might work. Adobe Text looks good! It&rsquo;s not sold separately, is it? I&rsquo;m still on CS4.
The SBL is again, a little bit too «traditional» perhaps, and I see no Italics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve checked out some others – turns out the Greek of Greta is a surprisingly good match stylistically and very close to what I was imagining (of course expensive too; but I already have part of it).

Does this look good to people who actually know Greek?</p>

GFS Elpis might be in the right vicinity too.</p>
<p>However, do you need the ancient numerals (like koppa and sampi)? If so, Elpis doesn&rsquo;t have them. Minion Pro has them in lowercase, which is usually - but not always, depending on the kind of texts you&rsquo;re setting - all you need.

I hope this «most part» includes all of the basic uppercase/lowercase letters as well as accents? I think I&rsquo;ll mostly be dealing with short Greek quotes and single terms, rather than long passages; I also don&rsquo;t think I need the numerals BTW – but I should check back with the editors.</p>

I&rsquo;m not sure about the accents - they are rather understated, and angle of the acute and grave accents is very steep (thus poorly differentiated). To my eye, Greta works better for monotonic Greek than for polytonic. However, if the Greek text is only short snippets, it would probably be OK. The sort of people who care about the exact choice of words in ancient texts will know the accentuation from context anyway.</div>

<p>…does not match <em>how</em> – and <em>why</em>? 
I mean, would I want to make it stand out/apart more; or would I want something more authentically Greek that then can&rsquo;t match the Latin so closely? …?</p>
<p>The sans idea is interesting R. I doubt it&rsquo;d necessarily be easier to find a sans that has just the right amount of contrast to the serif, though… I&rsquo;ll give Fedra a try.</p>

<p>I really think that one needs to match vertical proportions, and therefore use a compact Greek.</p>
<p>ANY style of Greek font with comparable capital and x (kappa) height to Newzald should be the starting point.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Nina,</p>
<p>Nick is right on about the desirability of similar vertical proportions, but I also agree with the others who suggest you don&rsquo;t try to &ldquo;match.&rdquo; I think there&rsquo;s a middle ground between matching and jarring: A complementary non-match is better than an imperfect attempt at matching.</p>
<p>Though I don&rsquo;t have my copy (copies) of <em>Elements of Typographic Style</em> handy, I think Robert Bringhurst suggests something like this when combining Latin and Greek (and Cyrillic) scripts. I seems to me that when you&rsquo;re using a type doesn&rsquo;t have Greek letters, it might be best to look for something different enough not to look like a bad match. It&rsquo;s kind of like the style convention of using italic for occasional foreign words (using Latin script) within an English language text.</p>
<p>I like the idea of a sans like  Fedra &ndash; or any Greek face that&rsquo;s got workable proportions but less stroke contrast than Newzald. Let us know how your experiments with it go.</p>

<p>By that logic, if you set a job in Arno or Garamond Premier, etc., you&rsquo;d change fonts to set any Greek?</p>
<p>And while I suppose I&rsquo;m hopelessly out of date, I&rsquo;d not set any Greek run into the text with a sans when the text is set in a serif. At some point, type has to be about the reader and his/her unsophisticated expectations, not about the oh-so-erudite designer . . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Most likely, the unsophisticated expectation of the reader is that all the letters in a text, regardless of the alphabet they belong to, should look as if they were part of the same set, i. e. typeface. If this is not possible because the font does not contain all the characters needed, it might be least distracting to use a noticeably different typeface for a well-defined group of letters, namely Greek ones, than to make a moribund attempt at creating the perfect match. To my mind, this is not erudite, it is just good sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK. Thanks again everyone. I don&rsquo;t know how «moribund» this is, but I&rsquo;m really liking Greta&rsquo;s Greek. (And it actually looks like we&rsquo;re going to lose the accents.)
I&rsquo;ve sent this to the client for review:
<img src="/images/old-images/greta_newzald1_4865.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/images/old-images/greta_newzald2_3874.jpg" alt="">
I think it looks harmonious enough in terms of proportions, color and mood – Greta seems a hair darker, but I set it a tiny bit smaller (and the Italic looser, too). 
I suspect that the very fact that this was designed as a companion Greek to an existing (if different) Latin font gives it the sort of attitude that allows it to blend into a Latin body (something I think the very culturally-authentic Greek-dominated fonts would not do to the same degree); and I think in this setting I really need the Latin to dominate. On the other hand, I enjoy how Greta has a slightly fresher and rougher attitude, especially in the Italics, that keeps it from being completely subservient.</p>
<p>If the client doesn&rsquo;t like this, I guess we&rsquo;ll have to go the «contrast» route, which I think might not ideally work in this sort of layout and might create too many distractions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you. Dropping the diacritics was their own idea actually, for reasons of unifying the appearance of the Greek in the different texts that use it (only one, so far, has Polytonic); and they say in the context of this book (which is not in classical studies) it would be rather unusual to use them. I&rsquo;m still waiting for the final decision though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Monotonic has an abbreviated set of diacritics which indicate syllable of emphasis although the fluent Greek speaker knows where the emphasis is without them. I am assuming small bits of Greek shown within your mostly Latin script text will not affect meaning or readability for either the fluent Greek scholar or the completely naive reader of Greek for your purposes. The better path would be to use the monotonic version that would, to some small degree, help the few in-between readers who know just enough Greek to be dangerous, like me :-)</div>

<p>Yes. I&rsquo;m currently setting something in Minion that has only a few words of Greek (which happen to be all lowercase), and I&rsquo;m using Alfios italic to do the job. It just seems to me that while Greek fonts made to match with Latin ones might be suitable for mostly-Greek text, it doesn&rsquo;t look good with predominantly Latin-alphabet text. It might just be my personal preference, but the italic Greek in fonts like Minion don&rsquo;t look good at all, and the upright wouldn&rsquo;t provide enough contrast with the English text. (If I were setting a French word in English text, it would be italicized to provide this contrast.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t speak Greek, but I would guess from the context that the Greek here would not be Modern Greek. Does anyone know whether it would ever make sense to apply monotonic accents to anything other than Standard Modern Greek?</p>
<p>As far as I know, anything from Classical Greek to the adoption of monotonic orthography would best be written with polytonic orthography, and Archaic Greek or less well-known ancient dialects would dispense with diacritics altogether. But since marking Classical Greek texts with diacritics began in the Hellenistic Period, writing Classical Greek terms without diacritics would also be a valid approach. I just feel that adopting a pseudo-monotonic orthography would be an anachronism here.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, monotonic ancient Greek would be an absurdity. Whether you dispense with diacritics or not for early inscriptions is mostly a matter of whether you use the original uppercase only or turn them into lowercase. Non-Attic dialects in lowercase are still normally marked with diacritics. The main exception is Mycenaean Greek, which (at least in English-language contexts) is normally written in the Latin alphabet without diacritics, if it isn&rsquo;t in the original Linear B.</div>
