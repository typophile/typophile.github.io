  body: on a different post there was a question about Evert Bloemsma, curious because
    the name by itself didn&#39;t conjur anything i started a search on google. one
    site that came up was <A HREF="http://www.typographica.org/" TARGET="_top">http://www.typographica.org/</A>
    -on the surface there wasn&#39;t much to read until i looked at its source code.
    there seems to be quite the list of people to explore

    <BR>Assuming this is true, what planet do these guys live on? And why are type
    foundries not more realistic when theyre drawing up their licenses? So I cant
    use Emigre fonts in PDFs &#40;assuming the problem is with embedding&#41; and
    Flash files? Just as daft is the idea that printers should buy their own copies
    of fonts. Yeah right. '
