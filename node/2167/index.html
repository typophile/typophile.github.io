I can then give feedback on the entries, and they'll be revised, altered, etc., until the deadline comes, at which point I pick a winner and they receive the cash. <BR> <BR>Is there anything like that for typography, possibly on this forum?

		<div class="commentbody">James, a lot of graphic designers (and all major design associations) <i>do</i> frown on spec work. It devalues the work, invites amateurism, and opens the artist to all kinds of intellectual-property vulnerabilities. Design contests are often tolerated when run by nonprofit organizations, but that's about it. <BR> <BR>Good design involves more than just coming up with a neat idea. It requires research, investigation, and getting to know the client. If you want good design, hire professionals and pay them for their time and work.</div>

A 'good designer' would be one well versed IN typography. I think you will find many talented 'typographers' who could set a beautiful page for you, but would be clueless when it came to trying to develop and impliment an identity. If this makes sense. <BR> <BR>Ohh, and no, you will NOT find a 'good designer' <BR>who will do spec work.
