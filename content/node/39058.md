body: "King's Caslon is Dalton Maag's latest addition to its exclusive font library.
  It is based on the custom font we designed for the King's College London earlier
  this year. The main differences are that instead of a Semi-Bold we provide a Bold
  weight and we have added a few extra ligatures to the fonts. King's Caslon is available
  with Standard or Typo characterset. To see what it looks like, use TypoGFX for testing.\r\n\r\nTo
  view the King's Caslon and test Typo GFX go to http://www.daltonmaag.com/typogfx/\r\n\r\nThis
  release of TypoGFX is for public Beta testing. We would like to hear your comments
  and suggestions to make it an even better tool.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag
