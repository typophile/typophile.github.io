body: "Prof. Aron Dotan explained to me that by understanding the relationships between
  different kinds of dagesh and nikkud, then it is possible to mark vocalized Hebrew
  text with replacement Hebrew grammar symbols, such as the shvah-na/shvah-nach and
  the kamatz-katan/kamatz gadol.\r\n\r\nHence, I seek to understand clearly what causes
  a shvah to be either na or nach, or a kamatz to be either katan or gadol, or a dagesh
  to be either kal or chazak.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the remaining 7 nikkud must be understood
  accordingly.\r\n\r\n(Apparently, there are three forms of each nikkud and dagesh.
  That totals 10 x 3 = 30, or if the cholam haser dot is included, this the total
  would be 33.)"

    or, in Biblical Hebrew, Sh'wa (Hebrew: \u05E9\u05B0\u05C1\u05D5\u05B8\u05D0\u200E)
    is a Hebrew niqqud vowel sign written as two vertical dots \"\u05B0\" underneath
    a letter. In Modern Hebrew, it indicates either the phoneme /e/ or the complete
    absence of a vowel (\xD8), whereas in Hebrew prescriptive linguistics, four grammatical
    entities are differentiated: resting (na\u1E25 / \u05E0\u05B8\u05D7), moving (na
    / \u05E0\u05B8\u05E2), floating (mera\u1E25ef / \u05DE\u05B0\u05E8\u05B7\u05D7\u05B5\u05E3)
    and \"bleating\" or \"bellowing\" (ga'ya / \u05D2\u05B7\u05BC\u05E2\u05B0\u05D9\u05B8\u05D4).
    In earlier forms of Hebrew, these entities were phonologically and phonetically
    distinguishable, but the two variants resulting from Modern Hebrew phonology no
    longer conform to the traditional classification, e.g. the (first) Shva Nach in
    the word \u05E7\u05B4\u05DE\u05B7\u05BC\u05D8\u05B0\u05EA\u05B0 (fem. \"you crumpled\")
    is pronounced /e/ (/ki\u02C8matet/) instead of being mute, whereas the Shva Na
    in \u05D6\u05B0\u05DE\u05B7\u05DF (\"time\") is mute (/zman/).\r\nIt is transliterated
    as \"e\", \"\u0259\", \"'\" (apostrophe), or nothing. Note that usage of \"\u0259\"
    for shva is questionable: transliterating modern Hebrew shva with \u0259 or '
    is misleading, since it is never actually pronounced [\u0259] \u2013 the vowel
    [\u0259] does not exist in modern Hebrew \u2013 moreover, the vowel [\u0259] is
    probably not characteristic of earlier pronunciations either (see Tiberian vocalization
    \u2192 Mobile Shwa = Shwa na'). .\r\nA shva sign in combination with the vowel
    diacritics pat\xE1\u1E96, seg\xF3l and kam\xE1ts kat\xE1n produces a \"\u1E96at\xE1f\":
    a diacritic for a \"tnu\u02BF\xE1 \u1E96atuf\xE1\" (a \"fleeting\" or \"furtive\"
    vowel).\r\n\r\n\r\nPronunciation in Modern Hebrew\r\n\r\nIn Modern Hebrew, shva
    is either pronounced /e/ or is mute (\xD8), regardless of its traditional classification
    as shva na\u1E25 (\u05E9\u05B0\u05C1\u05D5\u05B8\u05D0 \u05E0\u05B8\u05D7) or
    shva na (\u05E9\u05B0\u05C1\u05D5\u05B8\u05D0 \u05E0\u05B8\u05E2), see following
    table for examples. The Israeli standard for its transliteration[1] is /e/ only
    for a pronounced shva na (i.e., one which is pronounced /e/) and no representation
    in transliteration if the shva is mute.\r\nIn Modern Hebrew, a shva is pronounced
    /e/ under the following conditions:[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition for /e/ pronunciation

    traditional Hebrew grammar, shvas are in most cases classified as either \"shva
    na\" (Heb. \u05E9\u05D5\u05D5\u05D0 \u05E0\u05E2) or as \"shva na\u1E25\" (Heb.
    \u05E9\u05D5\u05D5\u05D0 \u05E0\u05D7); in a few cases as \"shva mera\u1E25ef\"
    (Heb. \u05E9\u05D5\u05D5\u05D0 \u05DE\u05E8\u05D7\u05E3), and when discussing
    Tiberian pronunciation (ca. from the 8th until the 15th century) some shvas are
    classified as \"shva ga'ya\" (Heb. \u05E9\u05D5\u05D5\u05D0 \u05D2\u05E2\u05D9\u05D4).\r\nA
    shva is categorized according to several attributes of its grammatical context.
    The three categories of shva relevant to standard grammar of Modern Hebrew are
    \"shva na\", \"shva na\u1E25\" and \"shva mera\u1E25ef\"; the following table
    summarizes four distinguishing attributes which determine these categories:\r\nDoes
    the shva supersede a vowel or no vowel in the word's non inflected form?\r\nIs
    the preceding letter pointed with a \"short\" or a \"long\" niqqud-variant?\r\nIs
    the following letter, when \u05D1\u05D2\u05F4\u05D3 \u05DB\u05E4\u05F4\u05EA,
    pointed with a dagesh qal or not?\r\nIs the letter which is pointed with shva
    assigned to the preceding or to the following syllable?\r\nTo help illustrate
    the first criterion (existence or non-existence of a vowel in the word's non inflected
    form), the \"location\" of the shva, i.e., the place within the word where the
    lack of vowel is indicated by it, is marked within the phonemic transcription
    with an orange linguistic zero: \xD8; if existing, the corresponding vowel in
    the basic (non inflected) form of the example is also marked in orange.\r\ntype

    Na\r\nIn most cases, traditional Hebrew grammar considers shva na to be an entity
    that supersedes a vowel that exists in the basic form of a word but not after
    this word underwent inflection or declension. Additionally, any shva marked under
    an initial letter is classified shva na.\r\nMerely identifying a given shva as
    being a \"shva na\" offers no indication as to its pronunciation in Modern Hebrew;
    it is however relevant to the application of standard niqqud, e.g.: a \u05D1\u05D2\u05F4\u05D3
    \u05DB\u05E4\u05F4\u05EA letter following a letter marked with a shva na may not
    be marked with a dagesh qal (Modern Hebrew phonology sometimes disagrees with
    this linguistic prescription, as in \u05D6\u05B4\u05E4\u05B0\u05BC\u05D6\u05B0\u05E4\u05BC\u05D5\u05BC
    \u2013 \"they zapped\" \u2013 in which the second pe is pointed with a dagesh
    qal although preceded by a shva na), or: the vowel preceding a letter marked with
    a shva na must be represented by the \"long\" niqqud-variant for that vowel: qamats
    and not pata\u1E25, tsere and not segol etc.[\u2191]. Furthermore, in standard
    syllabification, the letter under which a shva na is marked is grouped with the
    following syllable.\r\nThe Academy of the Hebrew Language's transliteration guidelines[1]
    specify that shva na should be transliterated only if pronounced in Modern Hebrew,
    in which case \"e\" be used for general purposes and \"\u0115\" for precise transliteration.
    Generally shva na is sometimes transliterated \"\u0259\"; concerning Modern Hebrew
    pronunciation however this symbol is misleading, since it is commonly used in
    linguistics to denote the vowel Schwa, which does not exist in Modern Hebrew.\r\nA
    shva na can be identified as such by means of the following criteria:\r\nwhen
    marked under the first letter of a word,\r\nwhen marked under the first of two
    identical letters,\r\nwhen it's the second of two shvas marked under two consecutive
    letters (except when marked under the last letter of a word),\r\nwhen the letter
    before the one under which it is marked is marked with a \"long\" niqqud-variant,[\u2191]\r\nwhen
    marked under a letter with a dagesh \u1E25azaq (historically an indicator of gemination).\r\nFor
    a more detailed account, see Tiberian vocalization \u2192 Vowels.\r\n[edit]Shva
    Na\u1E25\r\nTraditional Hebrew grammar defines shva na\u1E25 as indicating the
    absence of a vowel. In Modern Hebrew, some shvas classified as shva na\u1E25 are
    nonetheless pronounced /e/ (e.g. the shva under the second dalet in the word \u05E9\u05B8\u05C1\u05D3\u05B7\u05D3\u05B0\u05EA\u05B0\u05BC
    \u2013 /\u0283a\u02C8dadet/ \u2013 \"you (f.) robbed\"; see table above).\r\nIn
    all but a small number of cases, a shva not conforming to the criteria listed
    above is classified shva na\u1E25. This offers no conclusive indication as to
    its pronunciation in Modern Hebrew; it is however relevant to the application
    of standard niqqud, e.g.: a \u05D1\u05D2\u05F4\u05D3 \u05DB\u05E4\u05F4\u05EA
    letter following a letter marked with a shva na\u1E25 must be marked with a dagesh
    qal (Modern Hebrew phonology sometimes disagrees with this linguistic prescription,
    as in \u05DC\u05B0\u05E4\u05B7\u05E1\u05B0\u05E4\u05B5\u05E1 \u2013 \"to miss\"
    \u2013 in which the second pe lacks a dagesh qal although preceded by a shva na\u1E25),
    or: the vowel preceding a letter marked with a shva na\u1E25 must be represented
    by the \"short\" niqqud-variant for that vowel: pata\u1E25 and not qamats, segol
    and not tsere etc.[\u2191]. Furthermore, in standard syllabification, the letter
    under which a shva na\u1E25 is marked is grouped with the preceding syllable.\r\nThe
    Academy of the Hebrew Language's transliteration guidelines[1] specify that shva
    na\u1E25 should not be represented in transliteration.\r\n[edit]Shva Mera\u1E25ef\r\n\"Shva
    mera\u1E25ef\" is the grammatical designation of a shva which does not comply
    with all criteria characterizing a shva na (specifically, one marked under a letter
    following a letter marked with a \"short\", not a \"long\", niqqud-variant[\u2191]),
    but which does, like a shva na, supersede a vowel (or a shva na) that exists in
    the basic form of a word but not after this word underwent inflection or declension.\r\nThe
    classification of a shva as \"shva mera\u1E25ef\" is relevant to the application
    of standard niqqud, e.g.: a \u05D1\u05D2\u05F4\u05D3 \u05DB\u05E4\u05F4\u05EA
    letter following a letter marked with a shva mera\u1E25ef should not be marked
    with a dagesh qal, although the vowel preceding this letter could be represented
    by the \"short\" niqqud-variant for that vowel.[\u2191] This reflects sometimes,
    but not always, pronunciation in Modern Hebrew, e.g. \u05DE\u05B7\u05DC\u05B0\u05DB\u05B5\u05D9
    (\"kings of\") is commonly pronounced in accordance with the standard form, /mal\u02C8\u03C7ej/
    (with no dagesh qal in the letter kaf), whereas \u05DB\u05B7\u05BC\u05DC\u05B0\u05D1\u05B5\u05D9
    (\"dogs of\"), whose standard pronunciation is /kal\u02C8vej/, is commonly pronounced
    /kal\u02C8bej/ (as if there were a dagesh qal in the letter bet). In standard
    syllabification, the letter under which a shva mera\u1E25ef is marked is grouped
    with the preceding syllable.\r\n[edit]Shva Ga'ya\r\n\"Shva Ga'ya\" designates
    a shva marked under a letter that is also marked with the cantillation mark \"ga'ya\",
    or \"meteg\", e.g. the shva under the letter bet in the word \u05D1\u05B0\u05BC\u05D4\u05D5\u05B9\u05E0\u05D5\u05B9\u05EA
    (\"toes\") would normally be classified a shva na and be transliterated \"e\":
    \"behon\xF3t\" (or according to the precise standard[1], \"\u0115\": \"b\u0115hon\xF3t\"),
    however, if marked with the ga'ya cantillation mark, , this shva is classified
    as shva ga'ya, and the transliteration reflecting its historical pronunciation
    would be \"bohon\xF3t\".\r\n[edit]Tnu\u02BF\xE1 \u1E96atuf\xE1 (\"fleeting\" or
    \"furtive\" vowel)\r\n\r\nWithin niqqud, vowel diacritics are sorted into three
    groups: \"big\", \"small\" and \"fleeting\" or \"furtive\" (\"tnu\u02BF\xF3t gdol\xF3t\"
    \u2013 \"\u05D2\u05D3\u05D5\u05DC\u05D5\u05EA\", \"tnu\u02BF\xF3t ktan\xF3t\"
    \u2013 \"\u05E7\u05D8\u05E0\u05D5\u05EA\" and \"tnu\u02BF\xF3t \u1E96atuf\xF3t\"
    \"\u05D7\u05D8\u05D5\u05E4\u05D5\u05EA\"), sometimes also referred to as \"long\",
    \"short\" and \"very short\" or \"ultrashort\". This grouping might have correlated
    to different vowel lengths in earlier forms of Hebrew (see Tiberian vocalization
    \u2192 Vowels; spoken Israeli Hebrew however does not distinguish between different
    vowel lengths, thus this orthographic differentiation is not manifest in speech).\r\nThe
    vowel diacritics classified as \"\u1E96atuf\xF3t\" (\"fleeting\") all share the
    common feature of being a digraph of a \"small vowel\" diacritic (pat\xE1\u1E96,
    seg\xF3l or kam\xE1ts kat\xE1n) plus a shva sign. Similarly, their names are derived
    from the respective \"small vowel\" diacritic's name plus the adjunct \"\u1E96at\xE1f\":
    \"\u1E96at\xE1f pat\xE1\u1E96\", \"\u1E96at\xE1f seg\xF3l\" and \"\u1E96at\xE1f
    kam\xE1ts\".\r\nAs with a shva na, standard (prescribed) syllabification determines
    that letters pointed with a \"fleeting vowel\" diacritic be considered part of
    the subsequent syllable, even if in modern Hebrew pronunciation this diacritic
    represents a full-fledged syllable, thus e.g. the phonologically trisyllabic word
    \"\u05D4\u05B6\u05E2\u05B1\u05DE\u05B4\u05D9\u05D3\" (\"he placed upright\"),
    pronounced /he.e\u02C8mid/, should standardly be syllabified into only two syllables,
    \"\u05D4\u05B6\u2014\u05E2\u05B1\u05DE\u05B4\u05D9\u05D3\" (\"he\u2014\u0115m\xEDd\").\r\nName\tSymbol\tIsraeli

    kind and good for another, the other person responds with the following phrase:\r\n\r\n\u05D9\u05E9\u05E8
    \u05DB\u05D7\u05DA\r\n\r\nThis is pronounced: \"Yashar Kocha'cha\". Some say,
    \"Yashar Koach\".\r\n\r\nThis means, \"Your strength was correct\".\r\n\r\nIn
    English, we say, \"More power to you\"."

  body: "I'm glad that link turned out to be helpful. These discussions piqued my
    random and boundless curiosity, and I expected there would be resources out there
    - since languages, unlike high-tech electronics, don't change rapidly, for example,
    I've found many helpful foreign-language dictionaries now in the public domain
    on Google Books.\r\n\r\nAmazingly enough, but again, not surprisingly, since it
    is a work that's been around a long time, after my recent web searches turned
    up a mention that many editions of the Talmud copied the exact pagination of one
    particularly good early edition, I checked Google Books, and indeed there are
    several volumes of the Talmud there complete with the Mishnah in the middle and
    the Gemara around it.\r\n\r\nOn the [[http://www.archive.org/web/web.php|Smithsonian
    \"Wayback Machine\" site]], a translation of the Talmud into English that isn't
    even in the public domain yet has been kindly made available with the authorization
    of the copyright owners. A charitable organization dedicated to preserving books
    in the Yiddish language has put quite a few books up there.\r\n\r\nAnd you probably
    already know about [[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/|this site]]."
