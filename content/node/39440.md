  these letterforms. I have quickly sketched them out - and the words themselves don't
  mean anything.\r\n\r\nCan you respond to the following questions too?\r\n\r\nDoes
  the design of the letterforms suggest any reference to a particular country of region?\r\n\r\nWhat
  personality does it contain? Calm? Angry? Sporty?\r\n\r\nHow can I make it look
  more Indian?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTom"

    \r\n\r\n\r\n\"What personality does it contain? Calm? Angry? Sporty?\"\r\n\r\nIf
    it has to be one of those, its more Calm than Sporty, I guess. Can't see any Anger
    :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How can I make it look more Indian?\"\r\n\r\nIndian as in?   "

  body: "Tom, for an Indian those are two very different things! \r\n\r\nIn fact Bengali,
    doesn't even use Devanagari.  \r\n\r\nAre you designing something that looks broadly
    Indian to a western audience, or is it for an Indian audience?\r\n\r\nIf it's
    the first, you might try making your forms slightly more calligraphic. Also the
    letters should perhaps not be so geometric and angular. A device that you can
    try is to knock off the vertical sroke of the 'R' which would make it resemble
    the consonant 'Ra' in Devanagari. I'd probably use a two-storeyed lowercase 'a'
    which also may add a faux devanagari quality. (And of course finally render it
    in Pink since they say \"Pink is the Navy Blue of India ;) \r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand if it's being designed for Indians, you'll need to have far more focussed
    references than now.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Arun\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help, I think you will have a lot of
    influence of my work right now...\r\n\r\nYes I know I got the Devanagari - Bangladesh
    connection wrong. Is it correct to say that it is similar?\r\n\r\nI will tell
    you why I am so interested, I am designing a typeface to be used on the back of
    a football (or soccer) team here in England, West Ham United - have you heard
    of them?\r\n\r\nMy aim is to include references to the local Asian community:\r\n\r\n57%
    Asian/British Asian\r\n   -24% Indian\r\n38% Muslim\r\n\r\nWest Ham fans have
    a varied history, hooliganism and racism in the 80's are still associated with
    the club.\r\n\r\nI want my type design to just give a slight nod in the direction
    of the local community, as a way of saying - you are part of this club. I need
    to do this in a way so that loyal and passionate supporters - some who are ignorant
    - may not even notice the hints. It is very important to retain the dedicated
    fan base.\r\n\r\nI tried hard to make the forms not too inspired by Asian calligraphy,
    I simply adopted the stroke of the pen at an angle which was common in Devanagari
    typefaces and not very common in humanist latin typefaces I have looked at.\r\n\r\nI
    look forward to hearing from you again with your thoughts\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "\"the Devanagari - Bangladesh connection wrong. Is it correct to say that
    it is similar?\"\r\nI think so. Both are, I believe, derived from the same source\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"West
    Ham United - have you heard of them?\"\r\n\r\nNot a lot. Just familiar with the
    name. But I just looked it upto to get the broader context. Sounds like a really
    interesting project.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\" I need to do this in a way so that loyal
    and passionate supporters - some who are ignorant - may not even notice the hints\"\r\n\r\nThe
    cues have to be subtle enough not make it too Asian, and overt enough to be recognized.
    In a way you'd be betting on the Asian Brits to be subtler than the others :)
    Sounds very  challenging. Also I'm not sure what would be Pan Brit-Asian cues.
    \r\n\r\nTom, not being a typeface designer, I'm not sure how to go about this.
    But if you put up something I'd be more than happy to look at it and respond/help
    in any possible way.  \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"an angle which was common in Devanagari
    typefaces and not very common in humanist latin typefaces I have looked at\"\r\nGood
    idea. We once did an identity on just that premise. The symbol for the same client
    morphed an infinity symbol with the Devanagari character 'ka':\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_kotak_5576.jpg]"
