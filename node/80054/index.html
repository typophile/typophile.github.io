This approach is somewhat problematic. Say someone embeds such a font in a Word document, the recipient of that document would be able to edit the content. How would they know that there were prohibited from editing the doc? In general it's best to avoid putting embedding permissions and EULAs in conflict.

Effectively a document containing an unsubsetted editable embedded font becomes a template, reducing the need for additional licenses within an organization. I think a font vendor would prefer to sell a site license. </div>

So was I. I assume they don't want to be bothered with replacing fonts they already have installed, if all that's changed is licensing.

<em>I think a font vendor would prefer to sell a site license.</em>

Speaking as a font manufacturer/vendor, sure, but as I understand it most PDF documents using my fonts will not be in-house templates. The main reason to limit editing is so that documents that are sent to clients or suppliers of the licensee may not perform typesetting on the document, without having a license for the font. 

If licensees use the documents as templates, on multiple terminals when they are only licensed for a few, there's not much I can do about that.

However, if they attempt to do that, and find they can't, because the embedding bits disallow it, they will be really pissed of at my foundry. 

And they may well be accustomed to editable PDF functionality, because of the practice at Microsoft and Adobe, dishing out PDF-editable fonts willy-nilly, to help sell your big profit-centre products.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My own foundry --- VTF (www.vtf.fadebiaye.com) --- allows editable embedding. 
I respect the restrictive licencing policy of y'all, but I strongly disapprove it.
In my opinion, a typeface is a program which helps convoying information. Therefore, a typeface is meant to use freely. That means that type designers should be paid much more upfront, and then, basta!, people use typefaces freely. 

Of course, a typeface could be considered, as well, as a branding material and then, a restrictive licencing is perfectly appropriate. 

A perfect policy could be a mix of those two conceptions, some fonts for free use and others fonts semi-exclusive.

@m. butterick: i just bought the regular weight of FB Alix ; awesome!, how infortunate, however, that a free for use version (with less charset and no opentype features) does not exist!

N.B. : i am French, so for me, it's obvious that free does not mean free of charge, but english is badly equiped for this subtle distinction.</div>
