body: "I recently had some technical computer problems and pretty much had to reinstall
  Fontlab\u2026 I did save my com.fontlab.fontlab5.plist from a backup on one of my
  externals but even still I'm slightly paranoid as to if my preferences are set as
  they should be\u2026\r\n\r\nI know I received a few tips in the past for exporting
  only OpenType PS fonts and it had to do with the name records which was pretty important\u2026
  not sure if anything else was as important I can intuitively remember most of the
  other settings\u2026 does anyone know for sure any of the preference settings that
  I should be alerted to, to  ensure continued success upon export?\r\n\r\nThis time
  I'm going to take extra precaution and export my preferences to a new backup folder
  just in case.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nMike"
