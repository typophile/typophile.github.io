  body: '- The text spanning the full page is a bad idea / difficult to read. <BR>-
    The body text size at such a small size exacerbates that problem. <BR>- Avenir
    and Helvetica don&#39;t mix well &#40;that is Avenir, not Futura, right?&#41;
    <BR>- The navigation, heads and subheads are all the same size &#40;or very nearly
    the same size&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;FYI, I&#39;m on a Mac/Safari&#41;'

  body: an identity design and consulting company might want to stay away from stock
    photos of smiling people in suits. they don&#39;t say much... particularly about
    creativity.

  body: Here here! <BR> <BR>Blatantly stock photos. Either hire a photographer, or
    go a little more upscale into the rights managed schtuff where you get a little
    more edge. The pics they&#39;re using look like mid-90s PhotoDisc, bought on sale
    as part of a warehouse clearing &#34;Business Bundle&#34;. <BR> <BR>Blech. <BR>

  body: yeah those people don&#39;t look too creative - nor does the typography. <BR>
    <BR>I get a feeling of vertigo too. not everything has to move.

  body: 'When I visited the site, I didn&#39;t even see the identity consulting/mobility/products/User
    Experience options &#40;I&#39;m calling it frame 2&#41;, it was so far right.  And
    what&#39;s up with the inconsistent capitalisation?  The MS certified, DigitalIDWorld,
    VeriSign logos &#40;frame 1&#41; are all superfluous, and need to move somewhere
    less obtrusive.  The links on the header - Home, About IM, Solutions, Industry
    Experience, Careers, Contacts Us - need to stand out more: I looked over this
    page for three minutes before I even noticed them. <BR> <BR>I would probably start
    at the top with a header with less motion and more contrast - there&#39;s no reason
    for those squares and arrows to move except that the designer was pretentious.  Then
    below that, from left to right, I would have frame 2 and the main window.  Frame
    1 would, at most, be incorporated into the footer.  For some reason, it was important
    enough to be on every page, so I guess subjugating them to their own page isn&#39;t
    an option, but they don&#39;t even link! <BR> <BR>That&#39;s my significantly
    more than two cents worth. <BR> <BR>Van'

  body: 'The text on the front page is long-winded, dull and poorly-written, both
    in terms of grammar and in terms of providing information. <BR>The &#40;lack of&#41;
    spacing around the hyphens in the quote at the bottom turns the words into nonsense.
    <BR>The links down the right all go to the solutions page - this is an unnecessarily
    confusing approach to site navigation. <BR>The logos on the left add little to
    the site - we&#39;ve seen them often enough to know that they are no indicators
    of quality. <BR>Most of their &#39;industry experience&#39; seemed to be IT admin
    stuff - what&#39;s it got to do with identity? <BR>The information architecture
    needs work.  <BR>They need to believe you when you tell them to: <BR>Start by
    deciding what the site is for. What info needs to be there, and for whom? Purge
    the text of all that management bollocks, organise the info, then design the site
    navigation structure according to the structure of the information. <BR>'

  body: The problem with this site seems to spring from a problem with the company&#39;s
    image of itself. Identity Mine appears too scared to actually tell anyone what
    they do. Instead, they all their energy telling you why they&#39;re certified,
    great, and business savvy, with, as steve pointed out, dull, poorly set, and poorly
    written copy. It&#39;s also so laced with business-speak that it ends up communicating
    nothing but cognitive vacuity. On top of that, the &#39;identity&#39; stuff is
    based on some nebulous concept of technology and IT structuring determining identity.
    This connection is confusing. <BR> <BR>The &#39;Solutions&#39; page should be
    on the front, as it provides the most actual content, with the righthand navigation
    fromt the home page being the content, rather than existing as an oddly-placed
    series of faded stock-art. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t even get me started on the useless
    random Flash animations that refer to nothing at all. Circling arrows?? <BR> <BR>Again,
    Steve is right. They need to know <i>why</i> they want/ need a website, not just
    that they want one. This is a problem that goes to the core of their marketing
    &#40;on this site&#41;. If you can step into a meeting with them and get all that
    across without making all of them hate you, my hat goes off to you. Design is
    the least of their problems, but hopefully it can help them organize their thoughts.
    Good luck, Michael.
