body: "I'm producing a film that's centered around mid-century modernism, design,
  and architecture.  The subjects of the film are American designers and architects,
  and the time period is chiefly between the very early 1950s and the mid 1960s.  I'd
  love your opinions and your help in researching period- and genre-appropriate directions
  to take my onscreen titles.  More info inside.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm far from an
  expert on typography.  I currently have the titles, credits, and cgs set in Helvetica...
  which I realize is the safe but uninspired (and perhaps not period-correct, in terms
  of American design) route. I'm looking for avenues to branch out into, and your
  forum has the reputation of being the best and most knowledgeable type group on
  the internet.  I seek your wisdom.  I am a beginner, but I am not wary of reading
  wordy or difficult primers to type of this period--so by all means, suggest them
  if you have any great ones.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration, I've been perusing the [[http://av-geek.com/year/1956|Movie
  Title Screenshot Database]] (which is a wonderful resource), and I've found a few
  that looked fairly representative of directions I could see us going in.  Please
  feel free, if you have the time and the inclination, to critique these or to suggest
  other avenues to follow.\r\n\r\nHere were some standouts, to my layman's eye:\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/A/aboveusthewaves1955.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/N/not-as-a-stranger-1955.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/A/attackofthepuppetpeople1958.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/G/gideonofscotlandyard1958.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/M/Man+on+a+String+1960.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/C/childrenofthedamned1964.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/F/flesheaters1964.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/G/Gorgon+1964.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/B/Bad+Girls+go+to+Hell+1965.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/C/carryoncowboy1965.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/R/repulsion-1965.jpg.html\r\nhttp://av-geek.com/title/T/tenlittleindians1965.jpg.html\r\n\r\nAgain,
  it's a film on mid-century, trending towards high-modernist, design and architecture.
  \ I'm looking for something that plays well with that.  I feel only barely adequate
  to cover these topics... and entirely inadequate with the typographic treatment.
  \ Whatever directions you could suggest will be thoroughly considered, and very
  appreciated.  -John"

  body: "The difficulty with the mid 20th century as an American angle pointing towards
    the European style in architecture is that the most accurate face for that time
    would have been AG, a European font.  The architects who you might look at were
    as expected, Mies, et al. You could look on their American buildings and see what
    the original signage was done in?  Wright and Conn were \"The Americans\" of note.
    Looking at their signage as public buildings would be more accurate than looking
    at hollywood film titles.  I assume your story is much more about architecture
    than film titles? Wright has a typeface available from P22 but that might be too
    distinctly him and not the genre.\r\n\r\nI might also suggest letterspaced Futura
    caps as having the correct feeling of the time. Clarendon caps were another oft
    seen architectural face.\r\n\r\nAlso, here is an image from a MoMA show of the
    period called \"Signs in the Streets\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.alvinlustig.com/ai_si/ai_si.php"

    idea that strikes me would be to use a very identifiably contemporary typeface
    to conspicuously <em>contrast</em> with the images and themes presented onscreen.
    \ What are peoples' thoughts about and experiences with trying something like
    this?  This would seem to be a bit trickier and could have some pitfalls.\r\n\r\nWhich
    current typefaces could have a dialogue with older design elements... in a nuanced
    and helpful way, as opposed to a shouting at each other way?  (does any of this
    even make sense?  I'll try to elaborate if not.)\r\n\r\nAt any rate... great and
    very thoughtful suggestions thus far.  My thanks. -John"

    a clean grotesque like Helvetica, Akzidenz or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/castletype/standard_package_ot/?affid=99346\">Standard</a>

    with a serif or script unless it's the <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames\">warmer</a>,
    more <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/girardfonts\">whimsical</a> or handmade

    default font I always get.\"\r\n Univers or AG are better bets if that is the
    look you want. \r\nI grew up during that era and studied design in the early 1960's.
    The Architecture department was one floor below and most of their professors were
    true modernists. They all studied at Ulm or IIT. They would never accept any type
    other than AG, or Futura.  Helvetica and Univers were a bit past their time but
    would have been OK.."

  body: "I think it's worth pointing out that typeface selection alone is not the
    only issue. Line spacing and letter spacing should be considered. You may wish
    to look at typography from letterheads and brochures of that period. Particularly
    for the modernist furniture manufacturers and architecture firms you are covering.
    \ \r\n\r\nIf you have access to those resources, you should hire a designer who
    is expert in typography to set the type and assist you in composing the frames
    for your titles. This kind of collaboration will make a world of difference in
    your end result.\r\n\r\nHere's my XK9 Title Recipe\u2122 (Patent Pending) for
    making titles look sophisticated and more integrated into your moving images.
    \r\n\r\n1. DO NOT USE OPAQUE TYPE. A slight transparency (80-90% opacity) will
    make the titles seem a part of the image. It will make it feel more like a title
    from films where a photographic process was used to composite titles. \r\n\r\n2.
    NEVER USE A DROP SHADOW. If the image beneath the type is too bright- darken it.
    If that's not possible, consider cropping your shots and give your type its own
    area as a black, white or solid color field that bleeds off at least three of
    the four edges. If that's not possible, consider another shot or doubling up titles
    on a previous or subsequent shot. \r\n\r\n3. DO NOT USE 100% WHITE. In addition
    to making your type transparent use a value below 100% white and tint it to match
    your shots. If your images are predominantly cool, try a tinge of blue. Warm,
    tinge of gold. If you are able try selecting a white value from your clip. You'll
    be surprised how dark and tinted \"whites\" can be.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 . DO NOT ANIMATE
    THE TITLES. Unless you're an experienced motion graphic designer, do not even
    attempt to make your titles move. Nothing says \"cheesy amateur video\" like moving
    type. Fade up and fade out. Even better if appropriate, have it on your edited
    shot, cut to cut. If you're going to have one title immediately follow another
    do not put it in the same place on screen as the previous title.\r\n\r\n5. TYPE
    SIZE & SPACING, USAGE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT. Use a few different sizes of type
    as possible; and NEVER MORE THAN 2 TYPEFACES. On size, use one for credits (DIRECTED
    BY) and one for names (Your Name Here). Unless the title of the film is a designed
    logo or title treatment, use a slightly larger version (perhaps bolder weight,
    too) of the same typeface. Letter spacing should generally be slightly wider than
    you would do for text; the light of the screen of a TV or theater can make titles
    appear bolder than they looked on your screen.\r\n"
