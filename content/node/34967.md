body: "This is a theory I developed in 2003 while designing Preface, but I thought
  I'd introduce it here in relation to several Typophile threads which have discussed
  the relationship and variability of letterforms in the Latin-Greek-Cyrillic script
  triad.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Evolution1_4556.png]\r\n\r\nI
  set out to introduce a selection of more recent letterforms into the Latin grotesque
  (19th century sans such as AG/Helvetica/Arial), and discovered that these forms
  came from non-print media, where the spacing is not as subtle. Typewriter, road
  signs, OCR, computer monitor, neon, and the Breuer chair.\r\n\r\nIt's not a drastic
  change to the Latin script, which is so diverse anyway, but it's notable that the
  use of serifed forms of I, i, j and l in sans faces for typewriter and www makes
  these forms extremely widespread. \r\n\r\nWith both Verdana and Comic Sans featuring
  a serifed \"I\", that constitutes a 21st century default.\r\n\r\nGriffith/Bell Gothic
  also has this letterform; although designed for print, again crude, not subtle typography.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nGoing
  back a little further, somewhat more fundamental changes to the Latin script:\r\n1.
  Abolishing the long s, early 19th century.\r\n2. Establishing the single-storey
  g as a legitimate and widespread upright form (previously it had been used only
  for italics and scripts). AG (1890s) and Futura (1920s) were instrumental.\r\n3.
  Conversely, the use of tail-less \"f\", an upright convention, in italics."

    decided to do a comparison of significant grotesques and use the results to help
    me design a new one. This week I\u2019ll be layout out the commentary over the
    entire regular weight alphabets of ten faces, I\u2019ll post it once I have it
    ready."

  body: "Nick,\r\nI would also be interested to see how you view serif faces evolving
    through the same time period. \r\nThe linguistic changes (dropping long ess) are
    a different breed than what you show above. My guess would be that your Spiekermann
    affect is partially  computer screen induced. Adding the hooks to i and l not
    only help distinguish them from I and 1 but space better on low rez pixel based
    type.\r\nI don't know what to make of Bayer in all this other than popularizing
    the sans and perhaps the simplification and regularization of forms. I think you
    have to mix in the ancient Greek and Phoenician into the soup to balance the modernist
    occurrences though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    -- that non-serifed I, i, j and l are OK in sans print fonts, with subtlety of
    spacing, but problematic in other media, hence the appearance of serifed forms
    to better modulate spacing. \r\n\r\nBayer didn't directly popularized the \"bent
    tube\" construction that characterizes his unicase alphabet, but the direct inspiration
    of the Breuer chair does, I think, highlight the origins of this letterform in
    other media. While it's true that the round-nibbed \"Speedball\" pens could produce
    the effect in lettering, it was the stiffness of neon and metal tube which suggested
    a certain kind of geometric formality, without the humanist diagonal stroke which
    required acute angles that can't be easily created by tube- bending."

  body: "It's a theory.\r\nBoth were at the Bauhaus.\r\nBreuer's combination of plumbing
    and bike-frame technology to make furniture was the \"killer application\" that
    iconized the industrial turn taken by the Bauhaus. Sure, there were other reductive
    geometric influences on Bayer -- and his perspective drawings may well have influenced
    Breuer's chair -- but it's hard to look at the bold sans Universal Alphabet and
    not see it justified by the Armchair. Other sans faces of the era don't have have
    the same degree of tubularity. In chronological order:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/one_5688.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_4943.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/three_4832.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Four_4394.jpg]"

    seen anything along these lines."

    at that time\u2014especially at the Bauhaus. But she has not seen the idea posited
    elsewhere, nor seen evidence of it when she examined Bayer\u2019s archives."
