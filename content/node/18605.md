  want something strong, conservative, and elegant. If this isn't the best choice,
  are there any suggestions?\r\nThanks."

    I commend you on looking beyond the usual suspects for your identity. Are you
    a designer or a lawyer?

    punchcutter's work is DTL VandenKeere; you might also want to look at Augereau,
    Storm Jannon Text Moderne, and Conrad, depending on whether you want sixteenth,
    seventeenth or eighteenth century associations.

    to tell you to check TEFF's EULA. Their fonts are expensive, and their EULA has
    some unusual restrictions:\r\n\r\n\"The Licensee shall be entitled to install
    the fonts mentioned in Article 2 of this Agreement and to use these fonts to layout
    documents and/or for word processing purposes on no more than one computer and
    one output device belonging to the Licensee.\"\r\n\u2014Many EULAs allow 5 devices.\r\n\r\n\"Without
    prior written permission from TEFF licensee shall refrain from putting documents,
    files or data in which the fonts/data mentioned in Article 2 of this Agreement
    are embedded, such as .pdf files, at third-party's disposal and refrain from making
    documents, files or data in which the fonts/data mentioned in Article 2 of this
    Agreement are embedded available to any third-party.\"\r\n\u2014Many EULAs allow
    PDFs for print and preview.\r\n\r\nPersonally, these conditions would make me
    think twice."

    pro (highly familiar to the US lawyers)?\r\n\r\nYou'll be quite distinct in a

    in. It was "Counterpunch" that made Renard win me over. I wish more print looked
