  <BR>Serpentine <BR>Sonata <BR>Listho <BR>ITC Lubalin <BR> <BR>these are the worst
  offenders, there are others. <BR>I&#39;ve tried searching for the files but the
  system doesnt find them, and have deleted everything except the essentials &#40;Arial,
  Courier, Verdana, Tahoma&#41; from the Fonts folder in the control panel. <BR>Some
  fonts appear in some applications and not others. Eventually I&#39;d like as few
  typefaces loaded permanently as possible. <BR>Anyone know how to acheive this? <BR>'

    reason I don&#39;t know.

  body: Don&#39;t delete - these  <BR> <BR>Franklin Gothic &#40;medium and medium
    italic&#41;  <BR>Marlett  <BR>Microsoft Sans  <BR> <BR>As there are all fonts
    used by the user interface. Marlett and MicroSS can&#39;t easily be deleted as
    they are &#39;system file protected&#39;. <BR> <BR>All of the others, except Webdings
    are not fonts that come with Windows, so removing them may break other apps &#40;unlikely
    but possible&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR>
