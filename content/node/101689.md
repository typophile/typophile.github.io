  body: "Don't know if it's actually a font, more probably a custom job as almost
    all woodmarks in the fashion industry. For the rest, it looks like some sort of
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus|Bauhaus]] stencil.\r\n\r\nEDIT: unfortunately,
    even the stencil version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blippo-lt|Blippo]]
    does not have the right stencil. Another good base font would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-lt|Pump]]."
