  be about Athens, Greece. I am trying to get in touch with any type designers who
  live and/or work in Greece, preferably Athens. Do you know of anyone? \r\n\r\nThe
  past 2 issues of the magazine have used typefaces created by high profile type designers
  in appropriate cities and I wish to continue this precedent by representing the
  city through the typography. \r\n\r\nAny help or opinions on Greek type please get

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    GHD hair straighteners, <a href=\"http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to
    britney\u2019s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty,
    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get
    those ghd\u2019s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults
    include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P>"

    explore and follow up. @Nick Shinn you're spot on, for me it is more important
    to have an authentic greek-designed typeface to use as a headline font throughout
    the mag than it is to have a 'greek-looking' font. \r\n\r\nHere's Alex Sheldon's

  body: "The Detroit font nicely evokes Detroit. Soho sort of evokes London, but surely
    there are other fonts -probably including some by type designers from London-
    that evoke it better. I'm wondering what the rationale could be for focusing so
    much on the geography of the designer. Is there after all any person that's \"pure\"
    Athenian for example? What's the criterion for being \"from Athens\"?\r\n\r\nMore
    useful than a cute play on the idea of a font physically coming from a city would
    be a font that evokes that city no matter where it was made. For example if you
    find a font that somehow evokes Athens, but it was made in Thessaloniki, would
    you rather use a Parisian-looking font made by somebody was born in Thessaloniki
    but currently lives in Athens? If so, how do you justify that beyond your own
    whim? This path is clearly fraught with peril...\r\n\r\nA suggestion that's only
    partly serious:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100000&itemID=200029&cpuCount=\r\n\r\nRelated:

    body: "@hrant, this is all very subjective and i'm not sure that i've explained
      my position incredibly well... Yes, Detroit the typeface accurately evokes Detroit
      the city, as it was intended to do. Soho was not meant to represent London,
      but it does so very well and is hugely versatile for magazine headlines. As
      for other typefaces 'evoking London better' \u2013 perhaps \u2013 but I am trying
      to avoid trite and painfully obvious choices that remove any element of subjectivity
      or sensitivity from the work. Detroit you could argue does this, but its versatility
      and complexity elevate it above this. \r\n\r\nThe basic rationale is one of
      authenticity. Of wanting the magazine to truly be 'of the place' Each issue
      is dedicated to a city, and so when possible I like to match a great typeface
      or family by a local type designer, to represent that place. In answer to your
      question, No, I'm not so daft that i'd pass up a great typeface by someone from
      another Greek city, and go with something less-suited to the issue from a 'pure-athenian'.
      So yes, the primary task is to find a typeface that represented both the look
      and feel of the city \u2013 but to narrow the huge pool of options a good place
      to start is by looking at type designers from that city. They are also usually
      more interested in their type being used to represent 'their' city, and as such
      generally are happy to donate their typeface in exchange for the exposure the
      magazine gives them. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, as the art-director of the magazine, my
      whim also plays a part. \r\n\r\nThe tricky part is finding a typeface that represents
      a city I've never visited. We spend time in the city making the magazine but
      time constraints sometimes dictate needing to get a head-start on the process,
      hence me doing some research and investigation in advance. \r\n\r\nAnyway, enough
      waffle. A modern, Greek, authentic typeface is what I'm after :) thanks so much
      for taking the time to engage with me about this! I hope i've made sense. \r\n\r\n"

    certainly think you can find a font made in Greece -and probably Athens- that

    you might have to improvise.\r\n\r\nAnyway I for one would love to see your results,
