body: I am wondering of anyone has done a truly comprehensive feature comparison of
  various font editing and manipulation software from all available sources. [[http://www.fontlab.com/bc/compare/|The
  one on FontLab's site]] basically only serves to show how other FontLab products
  are crippled compared to FontLab Studio. I'm sure they don't mean it that way, but
  one can interpret it as driving an upsell to the higher end product rather than
  demonstrating how the lower priced programs are adequate for most needs. Of course,
  there is no mention of competing products, and the Third Party Font Software page
  on the FontLab site is horribly incomplete and outdated. Not even VOLT or AFDKO
  are listed.
