  letter \"V\". Its basic shape is like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/v-shape_6451.png]\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe
  goal is to make \"V\" resemble a flipped over \"A\" and include a pointy, arrow-like
  element to render a concept of \"bouncing back\".\r\n\r\nI thought I'd try and see
  if/how it would look in a Serif font, made few sketches and that's when I realized
  that I am seriously out of my depth here. I mean they look OK to me, but I just
  can't tell if the Serif option is something that's worth pursuing.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts,
  advice or comments on the following pair of sketches ? Either specific or of a general
  nature (e.g. \"don't mess with a good typeface\"). \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvc_4655.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvc-2_5102.png]"

    since that's what you're really doing. \r\n\r\nI have no strong reactions to it.
    If the arrow is intended to suggest going upward/beyond, perhaps it should exceed
    the caps height. "

    fishing hook, Craig. That's all I see now too :)\r\n\r\nThanks, guys. Case closed,
    serif'ed version is a no-go."
