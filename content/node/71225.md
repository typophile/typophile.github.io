    with some type of photo-mechanical distortion that lost the detail and fattened
    it up"

  body: "Yes. This typeface goes back to Herkules (H. Berthold AG, 1899), which is
    a bolder companion to [[Hermann Hoffmann]]\u2019s Carola (H. Berthold AG, 1896).
    There is another digitization by Dieter Steffmann, under the name of <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/h/hercules.htm\">Hercules</a>.
    The details (look at \u2018k\u2019) reveal that this version is the actual ID
    in this case."
