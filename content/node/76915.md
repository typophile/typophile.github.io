  kill a mockingbird\xAB several weeks ago. But I can't find it via the SEARCH-button.
  My question is, what font was used in the titel. It's neither Akzidenz Grotesk nor
  Basic Commercial. Am I right?\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me? Please!\r\n\r\nthanking
  you in anticipation.\r\n\r\nGreetings to all, Niko"
