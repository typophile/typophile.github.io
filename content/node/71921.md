body: "Hi everybody!\r\n\r\n[EDIT]\r\nNew question below, a bit related, but actually
  independent from the initial post\r\n[/EDIT]\r\n\r\n<strong>short version</strong>\r\nI
  need a font for a novel. Genre Distopia (like Fahrenheit 451, 1984, you get the
  genre). I must not be expensive. Would like to avid bundled and be individual. Thought
  about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/capsa/|Capsa]], because it is a book-font
  and price is right. It is darker though than any other text-font I know. Is it too
  dark; for which printing conditions? How would you rate it's quality (low on myfonts,
  why?)\r\n\r\nThen: Different suggestions, different style recommended? Suggestions
  for a cyrillic font as well?\r\n\r\n<strong>initial post</strong>\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  am looking for a font for the small scale publishing of a novel. The book is a distopia
  about a future world of consumerism, about a dictator brought to life again and
  controlled as a puppet. I am not connected with writing it, so please forgive I
  can't explain the plot better, as I don't have too much insight in the writing process.
  \r\n\r\nAnyhow the budget is limited, I am basically looking for a classic looking
  text font, easy to read. I thought it would be nice to have something which is classic,
  and somehow in contrast to a futuristic topic, as it reminds of the time before
  the novel sets place and how the society in the novel could develop in this direction.
  Maybe that is a misleading though, maybe something more edgy and modern would be
  better, I am open for suggestions.\r\n\r\nI was interested in <strong>Capsa</strong>
  by DStype [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/capsa/|on <strong>myfonts</strong>
  for example]], but I hesitate a bit. \r\n\r\nThe price for roman and italics with
  26$ each is quite right, that's why I consider it. My concerns are firstly I don't
  know if it suits the function as a book face. I know book faces are supposed to
  be darker, but this particular one is quite dark, even compared to Arno Pro, MVB
  Verdigris and similar darker faces. Isn't it too dark almost for the contemporary
  reader out there?\r\nIs there any advise why the font per se would be not a good
  font, as the rating is quite low? It seems to be a quality product, but I am not
  an expert, what is your opinion?\r\n\r\n\r\nOr any other proposals? Anything more
  modern or a different classic book font?\r\n\r\nAnd a second question, for this
  project we would need as well a fitting cyrillic font, classical or modern, I don't
  know as I am not a native cyrillic reader. I thought about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/maiola/regular/?testdrive=seed%3D31%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dpangram.7%26text%3D%255B%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520(Russian)%255D%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga|<strong>Maiola</strong>]]
  or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alexandra-korolkova/leksa/regular/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dpangram.7%26text%3D%255B%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520(Russian)%255D%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D41|<strong>Leksa</strong>]]
  maybe, but I would appreciate some help here, as I really don't know a lot about
  cyrillic type design."

    a short summery on top of the page. Would appreciate some help here, please.

    has cyrillic, for one, or NIck Shinn's Modern Suite, or maybe one of Stormtype's
    faces, including his Walbaum Pro and his Baskerville Pro. \r\n"

    appearance, anybody?\r\n\r\nI guess a font with latin and cyrillic in combination
    is a fine idea anyhow."

  body: I can't really judge Cyrillic designs either, but Leksa might be a good choice.
    It is very attractive, it has a nice complementary sans, and the designer is Russian.
    This is simpler than trying to find a Cyrillic that gives you similar color on
    the page to Capsa would be.

  body: "Thanks for the input so far. The question of publishing in Russian is still
    in the future though. \r\n\r\nTherefore for now, out of practical curiosity, I
    really would appreciate an educated estimation of one of you professionals how
    a font like Capsa would look on paper. Again it is the darkest typeface I saw
    in the tradition of Old-Style serif font made for body text! Is it too dark? I
    like it because it is very similar to Sabon actually, but a bit more \"organic\"
    meaning less straight cut, if that makes sense. So it seems warmer than Sabon,
    without being to playful. Just the color puzzles me. Please type-professionals,
    your opinion! \r\n\r\n[[http://www.dstype.com/public/specimens/Capsa.pdf|Capsa

  body: "The question of typographic \"color\" is complicated because it is affected
    by what size you want to set the type, and the leading. If you have a dark type
    like Quadraat, and set it relatively small with generous leading, then it won't
    be too dark. The best thing is to see printed examples, and then you can really
    judge. If someone here has used Capsa they could tell you better.   \r\n\r\nAlso
    the texture on the page is a matter of how the contrast of thick and thin, horizontal
    and vertical are handled. For example, my Williams Caslon looks dark but has stems
    that are not thick\u2014you can see the effect in [[http://typophile.com/node/65216|this
    thread]]. "

  body: "Hi everybody again!\r\n\r\nAs the project is getting on the way, the question
    is still current. In the meanwhile I came across a beautiful wedge serif with
    cyrillic and latis script! It seems to be a right mix between a classic \"skeleton\"
    and a contemporary wedge finish in details/terminals/curves. \r\n\r\nThe only
    problem, this font is not completed yet, here is a preview of \"Florian\": http://www.behance.net/gallery/Florian-Family/548744\r\n\r\nIt
    looks amazing to me, but I was wandering if anybody knows something similar, at
    least for the latin script. No matter which font will be used in the end, I would
    just like to know some similar alternatives. \r\n\r\nThanks to everybody!"

    Capsa, maybe [[http://www.dstype.com/profile.php|Dino dos Santos]] know some publishings
    where his font was used. I think Capsa is really beautiful, but is darker than
    most text faces and would work well just in quality prints and when properly typeset.\r\n\r\nRecently
    I decided to add Cyrillic support to my under-development [[http://www.typophile.com/node/67787|font]],
    but I believe its design is very orthodox to the kind of typefaces you look for."
