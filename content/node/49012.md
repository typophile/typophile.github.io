    you tell us your thoughts behind these logos?\r\nWhat is the concept driving all
    of this?\r\n\r\nIn what area is this business exactly? Financial is wide. Is it
    a large one or just a few people?\r\n\r\n"

    it with Wachovia's logo. The bottom one is reminiscant of a film production company
    that I can't place a name too right now.

    to differentiate and build brand equity through design this gets even harder.\r\n\r\nI
    think you did a good job on all of these though."

    investment. When investing I want to see $ not \xA2. Perhaps re-working #2 to
    eliminate the similarity to a \xA2 mark."

  body: "It seems that you have backed yourself into a wall with the usage of a circular
    mark. I think you may be able to jolt your creativity by exploring other shapes.
    \r\n\r\nI do however understand the correlation between the circle and a coin
    which does relate to financial, however the mark is beginning to looking more
    like a Frisbee.  Also you have several scale issues with the size of your marks
    and logotype, your mark is too large for some of the supporting type. By adjusting
    this scale you will increase your mark's legibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the type treatment in #4 and 5, if only \"Capital Partners\" was a
    tad bolder/easier to read. The all upper case works better than the upper and
    lower case. #1 is okay, but I prefer the letter height contrast in 4 and 5. However,
    it all depends upon the culture. Do these folks refer to themselves as CENTINELA
    with CAPITAL PARTNERS, more softly stated afterwards? Or are they CENTINELA CAPITAL
    PARTNERS? That should determine the typographical contrast. Either way, be sure
    to SPELL CORRECTLY, as there are typos in 'capital' on numbers 2 and 3.\r\nSymbolwise,
    keep it simple. 1, 2 and 3 are too complicated. Like bobbybobo, I need to know
    about the thought that drives the symbol. What about the company are you trying
    to communicate? What core values does the symbol represent? "

  body: '#2 with the type treatment on #5 would be worth a try. Also: In addition
    to the spelling error in "CAPTIAL," you also have, on the same line, an error
    in "PARNERS." As far as the mark in #2, I think it would be worth it to simplify
    it. For example, do you really need the double border? And, I just love the idea
    that the mark can be read as a safe lock. But, as David Ford points out, it can
    also be read as a maze. Can you simplify it and make it look MORE like a safe
    lock? '

    need not be that literal.  Heck all these are way too simple if you truly want
    them to reflect on the complexity of finance.  Making something memorable and
    iconic should be your goal.\r\n\r\n<em>Plus don\u2019t you think it look a bit

  body: "I'm sorry to be the wet blanket but I just don't see these icons as being
    positive ones for an investing firm. The design of your c mark looks way too much
    like either a copyright mark or a cents symbol. Neither seems appropriate. And
    reduced to business card size will just add to the confusion of the logo. You
    said your client wants to focus on security and confidence but what their clients
    will want from them is security and confidence in growth. I mean otherwise why
    give your money to an investment firm? Safety can be found in a bank or under
    your mattress. Is a lock/c symbol the best way to go?\r\n\r\nMy opinion is in
    the minority on this thread, and I don't want to seem harsh. I just believe that
    if you devote a little more time to exploring other ideas you will come up with
    a stronger design. "

    \r\n\r\nIt may also be just me, but I am kind of tired of the swooshes running
    through logos for finance. I work at a credit union and the swooshes and arcs
    seem too ubiquitous in the financial sector. \r\n\r\nIf you took the swoosh out
    of 5, I think it would be the best by far. I kind of get the impression you are
    going for the interlocking C and P, so if that's the case, why not keep it simple
    and take out the swoosh. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I always think about with swooshes
    and arcs is that they should always end up, especially in finance, to help people
    think positively about finance and your company. Downward angles in design always
    send out an impression of negativity. "
