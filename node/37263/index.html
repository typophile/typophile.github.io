<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So I've been commissioned to do an ad for a local restaurant promoting their good-old Northern-Irish Sunday Lunch menu - the proprietor wants a quirky message which will entice the customer to dine in their place instead of opting to do it at home, hence the tagline.
I'm trying to convey the idea that Sunday is indeed a day of rest, and they should let the business do the cooking for them, but I'm unsure whether it could be conveyed as blasphemous as it's bastardising the Bible.. kinda.
Anyway I'd like your oppinions - note - this is NOT anywhere near the final design, rather just an initial concept.

<div class=commentbody>The food image looks kinda orphaned at the bottom like that... perhaps bring the second line down into the space next to it (lower left), perhaps break it to 2 lines or make it smaller.
If you're worried about Biblical connotations, try something like "You work hard all week -- let us work do the work on Sunday"
or
"On the seventh day, they rest-auranted" (ooooh, that hurt as I typed it).

<div class=commentbody>It'd have to be a pretty prudish puritanical neighbourhood for anybody to be offended.
But then again, people are so easily 'offended' these days.

blasphemous? does it matter? if it is, that just means more publicity. ;o)
As for critique...the type seems a bit crowded against the edges of the billboard. Maybe give it a bit of breathing room?

<div class=commentbody>One of two things will happen: People will like the concept, or people will be offended. If you believe more positive comments will arise in that neighbourhood, then take the risk. Personally, I like the message.
As for the design, there's a bit of spacing and size issues, but I like the color and type choice.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's purely conceptual - just something to show how useful the space could be to the client if it were utilised well enough. As I'm from Northern Ireland, both Protestants & Catholics hold their religion quite dearly, but it's not exactly poking fun at scripture, is it?
I'm honestly at a loss to think of a better strapline concerning Sunday lunch - it fits the tone perfectly, and if I can convince my bosses (I'm currently on work experience) and both partners of the client business, I'll be pleased!
I appreciate the input, Typophiles, always a pleasure!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd like to find a setup like that to take a photo of. That would make great fontplay material.
Btw, if there was a reason to be offended, more Christians would be better off using the opportunity to dialogue in a brotherly way, than getting into a finger-pointing, judgemental mode.
Personally about the only time I do go out to eat (except for taking customers to lunch) is after church on Sunday. My current favorite is Panera. The bread is so good I can't seem to wolf my sandwich down fast enough. Actually, it is too good. For at least another day I am thinking about how good it was, and am calculating how I can go back again.

<div class=commentbody>I don't know about how Christians will react. But I do know that Hermann Zapf said: most commercial signs are too big. Your mock-up for sure blasphemes against Zapf.
Also this probably applies to only a few type freaks, but Helvetica makes me lose my appetite :) </div>

<div class=commentbody>Heh, too many typophiles are losing sight of the topic at hand (perhaps removing 'critique' in the title might help this).
The signage design hasn't started, nevermind finished - it's purely an idea which I'm considering as I'm unable to think of a better strapline.
Thanks for the comments though as always, it's definately something I'll be discussing in my <a href=http://www.paulwilsdon.com/blog.html>University Blog</a>.</div>
