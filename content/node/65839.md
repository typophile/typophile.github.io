  about to build a website for a gentleman who wants his customers to be able to download
  his product, (an application for surveyors), after successfully submitting their
  credit card information. I am using this forum because I know that people who sell
  fonts online use the same process. I would like to know if there is a third-party
  complete solution to this process... a service that perhaps process orders and than
  somehow provides a secure link to the server allowing the customer to download,
  or alternatively a password that allows access to the folder on the server. Or anything
  else for that matter????!!!???\r\nThanks One and All!\r\nDK~"

    to respond to some sort of email activation. There will be much less CC fraud
    if someone has to provide real traceable information and take part in a real \"paper

  body: "It's not just a matter of just googling for ecommerce solutions. The trick
    is finding a solution which is suitable for selling fonts. It would have to allow
    for free font updates, and automatic notification of updates. \r\nThere were a
    couple of good 3rd party, font suitable software selling systems before the dot
    bomb but since then I've never been able to find any that were as good. They all
    seem like a big step backward."
