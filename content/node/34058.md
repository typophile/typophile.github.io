body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nThis is my second typeface to design, and I am hoping for
  some feedback.  My inspiration was the cigar branding coming out of the Spanish
  Carribean in the the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Shown are all my fancy letters..
  for the letters with large swashes I am creating \"standard\" letterforms so any
  swash interference can be resolved. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/hispaniola_3689.gif]"

  body: "I like it overall.  I especially like the horizontal stroke on the A and
    H extending to the left, the diamond in the center of the O, the center mark in
    the S and Z, and the curve of the D.\r\n\r\nThe horizontals in the A, E, F, G,
    and H are all at slightly different heights, which looks accidental. (It's accentuated
    by the fact that EFGH are shown right next to each other.) I would pick one or
    two horizontal stroke positions and make these five letters conform to them.\r\n\r\nThe
    lower horizontal swash in E, L, and 2 match, and the Z and Q's match, but I think
    the two slightly different swashes are going to look weird when they are close
    together, like in words like 'lizard' or 'equal.'  Either make them identical
    or make them more different.\r\n\r\n6, 8, and 9 are very flowing and freeform
    -- much more so than the rest of the font. Maybe make them more geometric, add
    some straight lines or a serif. \r\n\r\nHope this is helpful. :)"

  body: yeah.. i understand what you're saying about the crossbar heights... but I
    arranged them according to the guidelins in Designing Type(karen cheng).. in usage
    though... I think they are optically correct.  thanks for the feedback

  body: "That's really lovely. The S is my favorite.\r\n\r\nBut that X swash is in
    bad shape.\r\n\r\nI think that if you made one shape from the tail of the 9 and
    the bowl of the 6, it would improve them both."

  body: "It\u2019s a gorgeous design. I really hope you do some ligatures that take
    advantage of the visual grammar you created with the swashes and open counters
    on letters that are usually closed. \r\n\r\nMy nitpicks follow:\r\n\r\n- The narrowness
    of <strong>S</strong> draws attention to itself and away from words.\r\n- Where
    the upper and lower lobes of <strong>B</strong> connect there\u2019s either a
    flaw in the drawing or just and optical problem that\u2019s putting a tiny bulge
    inside the upper lobe. It may just be a rendering issue that would go away in
    a PDF specimen.\r\n- Something funny is going on with the height of <strong>O</strong>
    and <strong>Q</strong>. In the word Hispanola the O extends above the capline
    and baseline, but when they appears in the alphabet the O and Q stop at those
    lines.\r\n- <strong>3</strong> looks like it has been rotated about ten degrees.
    \r\n- The gap in the counter of <strong>8</strong> is much larger than any of
    the other gaps in the typeface. All three of the gaps in the numbers are out-of-scale
    with the alphabet. \r\n- The connection between the vertical stroke and tail of
    <strong>J</strong> needs to flow better. It would also play better with the other
    letters if moved down a little. "

  body: The diagonal stems of the <strong>A</strong> look backwards. If they are going
    to be different, the heavier stroke should be on the right. The rest of the letters
    look like they are supposed to have a uniform stroke weight, so the <strong>A</strong>
    should probably be the same on both sides. Also, the stem weights seem to vary
    slightly from letter to letter. Seems like some might need adjustment.

    the feedback</em> \r\n\r\nthe criticism by glyphobet are totally legitimate. Those
    \"guidelines\" by Karen Cheng aren't rules, they are just observations. But those
    observations apply to typefaces for text usage. Look at some display faces with
    similar horizontal stroke positions. In most display typefaces the strokes are
    exactly or almost at the same height\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/industria/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-anna/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bodega-sans/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/\r\n\r\nand
    when you praise the observations by Karen Cheng as guidelines, why is your A backwards,
    and why does your O look so eggy!??!\r\n\r\nbest regards: Steven\r\n"

    make a winner.
