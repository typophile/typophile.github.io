  <BR>Posted on Wednesday, April 13  <BR> <BR> <BR>Microworld claims that its new
  plugin for the Windows version of Photoshop can create clearer type output at small
  point sizes.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no doubt that generating clear type output at
  small point sizes from any image editing application can be a challenge. Microworld
  has come up with a new approach in the form of a Photoshop plugin that it believes
  provides &#34;ultra-clear&#34; font output. It also adds a few extra touches, such
  as the ability to employ a user-defined font directory and provides a character
  map to ease font and symbol selection, with support for multiple languages.  <BR>
  <BR>Sharptype is available as shareware on the Microworld site, with registration
  costing $29.95. The unregistered version provides a limited range of font sizes.  <BR>

    works well.

  body: I dunno. All misleading posting behavior aside, I think the results are remarkable.
    Better than Truth-in-Design's <a href="http://www.ultrafonts.com/">Ultrafonts</a>
    stuff. Even more remarkable is that the antialiasing is automatic, not manually
    created by a designer. I wish there was a Mac version to play with, but the developers
    say not yet.

  body: "> Better than Truth-in-Design\u2019s Ultrafonts stuff.\r\n\r\nI think Handpainted
    Greyscale typography, ans even good old Macintosh Kare\xB4s fonts are far better;
    Pixelfonts Type designers have a choise to add typographic desitions plus just
    simply put smooth greys in jaggy corners.\r\n\r\nI have to stablish a \"clear\"
    ;^) difference on this point. \r\n\r\nTypographic Solutions: \r\nSpacing, kern,
    ascenders, leading, contrast, rithm, etc... right? plus the experience and style
    (sensibility\xBF?) from the typographic designer.\r\n\r\nBut there are always
    programs like this as a good cheap choice for small text render. \r\n\r\nSome
    ultrafonts are far better clean, but others not as equal than other small custom
    fonts from other foundries . I am not agree to clasify all in the same level,
    below sharptype \"smooth\" ware.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Ok, Gustavo. You got me there. Your forms are definitely clearer. (On a separate
    note, your spacing is a pixel too wide, adding a different element of difficulty
    to the reading.) I think we can both agree that not all the Ultrafonts are as
    well made as yours and Miguel's. And the advantage of Sharptype as a Photoshop
    plugin is that we can create graphics from <em>any</em> font. In that respect
    perhaps it's not really competition for Ultrafonts, but a different sort of tool
    for potentially different projects.

  body: You can try it first, so, you will see what different between Sharptype and
    Photoshop default type tools. I used it, by the way, I don't use the "USM" render
    method, and it could obtain clearer than upper.

  body: Ultrafonts is only the outline mode, not the polyfill mothod. You do not get
    the large size with 2 pixel width. Sharptype can provide any sizes what you want
    with the installed system fonts.

  body: "i see this thread has dropped off in the last week. however, i just discovered
    it, and find it an interesting topic.\r\n\r\ni build a lot of pixel fonts, so
    it can easily be said that my opinion in this matter is biased. however, i began
    building pixel fonts years ago due to my own design needs. this was back when
    atomic media was the only pixel font vendor, and style selection was thin. i had
    a need for stylistic type at small sizes for an online motorcycling magazine i
    was producing.\r\n\r\nmy point is, as a designer, i cannot think of one situation
    where i might use these fonts as rendered. they look like eyelashes covered with
    too much mascara.\r\n\r\nsharptype is an impressive engineering feat. i can appreciate
    the direction the software is trying to take: clear screen display typography
    at small sizes.\r\n\r\nbut, as it stands, i'd never use these fonts in a design
    i was going to show to an audience. i might use them for comping purposes, but
    what's the point in doing that? spend $35 for subjectively superior type?\r\n\r\nthink
    about it. how can a program replace human judment on a grid so small and sparse,
    every pixel placement and shade of gray will either make or break the design?\r\n\r\nit
    seems to me to be similar to software teams building a font blending program and
    proclaiming that designers only need two typefaces from now on: one sans, and
    one serif. just tell the program what blend balance you want between the two,
    and the font is generated on the fly!\r\n\r\ntheir product might be an outstanding
    achievement from an engineering perspective, but they completely minimize the
    value of type design.\r\n\r\nnow, i'm not saying that all pixel font designs are
    created equal. nor, am i saying that i am an authority on pixel font design.\r\n\r\nbut
    really, what is to be gained by trying to minimize the importance of pixel font
    usage or design? why endorse an automated solution for the creation of design
    assets (rendering a traditional font is really the recreation of it) when DESIGN
    is the point of it all?\r\n\r\nwhy would human designers value automation over
    human designs?\r\n\r\nis it cost savings? buy one $35 program instead of the average
    $100 the typical designer might spend on an entire pixel font library?\r\n\r\nis
    it for better font management due to fewer fonts to worry about?\r\n\r\nthink
    about the incredible attention to detail that goes into every single font this
    software can render. all that wonderful artistry is lost when it is translated
    into pixel building blocks, each quite literally taking up 1/4 of each glyph's
    height and doubling its stem widths.\r\n\r\npixel fonts exist in their own right
    because at certain sizes, hinting fails, traditional fonts lose their character,
    and even their readability.\r\n\r\nin my opinion, it should be a welcome idea
    to designers that new rules are there to be explored for display typography, and
    as a result, new typographic styles to be established.\r\n\r\nwhy try to render
    traditional typography on screen at the smallest of sizes, when that typography
    was never designed for screen use, let alone small sizes?"

  body: "Stephen, you've always been ambivalent about the Ultrafonts stuff - it's
    strange to see you jump up and say something is \"better\"... Not to mention that
    you were probably looking at that on a Mac, where the flatter gamma would hide
    the crapfuzziness. It's good to see a company like Sharptype trying to improve
    small font rendering*, and maybe it is indeed better than out-of-the-box Photoshop
    rendering (maybe) but it's not remotely as good as what the human eye/hand can
    do. Gustavo did a good job demonstrating that; Mana-9 will do an even better job.
    \ :->\r\n\r\n* Especially in the light of so many designers who ignore the problem.
    The other day I was complaining about the small text on a website of a typography
    PhD, and the reply was: we see nothing wrong with it. Yeah, the fuzzy stems and
    horrid spacing is just dandy I guess...\r\n\r\nThe only thing that comes close
    to handmade grayscale fonts is the Longhorn Cleartype stuff; however, in Cleartype
    a character can have different renderings depending on where it falls on the subpixel
    grid - and this is because it maintains the classic unhealthy attachment to WYSIWYG.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    because the Ultrafonts vary widely in quality. And I do acknowledge that a <em>good</em>
    designer's handplaced pixels will always be better than a machine's.\r\n\r\nMy
    main excitement in Sharptype lies in its ability to render <em>any</em> font better,
    and I'd like to see more examples in action. Patrick?"

  body: Yes, your type is clearer than sharptype provided. But, the important point
    of Sharptype is, can provide clearer type for ANY installed vector font files,
    do not need to design everything again.
