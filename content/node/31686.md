  the start of the year, so to coincide with CNY, Happy New Year to you all. Anyway,
  I came for a reason, and that reason was to ask:\r\n\r\nIs [[H. berthold AG|Berthold]]
  [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] available to purchase as separate weights? A client has requested
  we use the regular and medium weights to set their product copy\u2026 but they appear
  to only be available to buy as a family. Is this right?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\nHigashi\r\n\r\n"

    right up there with House Industries, HTF, many others."
