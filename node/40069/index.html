  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Im having trouble going forward with my gallery logo. Could anybody give me some critiques/ suggestions about what I could do to make it better? The gallery is wallpaper designing/ board designing that I been working on now for some time. I know its hard to give critiques because you have no clue what sort of designing im doing. So i would appreciate any critiques/suggestions about this logo!

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ted ... It looks like the bowl on the R forms a 3 ... or is that an ampersand?

That concept could work, but you should try to match the weight and stress of the typeface.


other suggestions:

* the bottom floral assortment feels stretched, and the gradient really doesn't help distinguish it.
* The clover shape inside the O feels like more of an afterthought than anything.
* seems redundant to say Trifolium twice.


Maybe see if you can pull of the TR portion to match the rest, and go from there?

about the only suggestions i can muster right now. best of luck.

		<div class="commentbody">Chuck I think we agree then. Fundamentally. Mostly.

Whatever a logo/identity is -  it has to cohere & have an impact. Or perhaps better - have a result that is the desired one. 

When you expand from logo into identity boundriess can be allowed to blur & squish with success I think. But again with the proviso that they cohere. And by cohere I don't even mean that they share a style - nothing that formal - just that ultimately the impact you get is the one you want. 

The messier/more complex things are the richer they <cite>can</cite> be.  But richness can also create more & more opportunities for failure or simple mediocrity.

One of the reasons I love great typography is that it is one of the all time great tools for pulling an identity together & giving just the spin you want. 

I also don't think that a logo has to to resolve into something even as simple as The Unilever logo. But I think it is often advisable. And it's even advisable to avoid the complexity altogether unless you are really on top of your game. And even then.

Anyway, this is a long way to go to try to suggest that Trifolium could have lots of flourishes and still cohere. So far it doesn't. 

Chuck's advice is sound. Going simpler might help especially if they number of elements you have is getting hard to control.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm a "less is more" kind of guy, so here go my four cents:

• I'd keep it simpler. Lose the vines (I imagine your wallpaper design is very complex/intricate, which would contrast nicely with a simple logo). Not too sure about the "TR" treatment...

• Use a three-leaf clover as cuttlefish suggested (I understand you wanting to use the four–leaf version, as it's more desirable/popular, but makes more sense not to).

• Set it in two lines instead of one (this would let you increase the size in any application).

• Solid color

Good luck, and post a link to your gallery's website sometime (I'd love to see what you're up to).

i'm not saying this just as a typocentric, but the vines are not helping your message. it's already there in the type.
