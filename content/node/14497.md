  Ulpius Traianus was born in 53 AD, and died in 117 AD. He was Roman Emperor from
  98\u2013117, during which point the Empire would reach it's greatest extent. During
  his reign, the Senate and People of Rome as errected a memorial to his wars, which
  slightly extended the Empire's frontiers even further into \"barbarian\" territory
  than they had already been.\r\n\r\nThis memorial is called \"Trajan's Column\" today.
  Although the object is mostly sculptures in nature (it is a tall column, which has
  a frieze of relief scultures spiraling up its shaft), a small inscription above
  the doorway on its base has driven type-minded people mad for centuries.\r\n\r\nContrary
  to the belif of some, this inscription is neither the debut of the [[Roman Alphabet]],
  nor the first time that it had used [[serifs]]. It is, however, probably the most
  famous example of both.\r\n\r\nWhile Roman handwriting was very different from Roman
  monumental lettering (whether hand painted, engraved, cut out of metal, or cut into
  stone), the letters on Trajan's Column represent one of the best examples left to
  us from antiquity. Trajan's Column, and samples like it, would go on to influence
  the development of the Roman alphabet, and later typeface design, for the next 2,000
  years.\r\n\r\nWhat was so special about the Roman's inscriptional lettering? The
  Romans\u2014who did not invent the idea of the alphabet\u2014where the first to
  put serifs on their letters. It is speculated that the [[serif]]'s origin was a
  result of applying a brush to the stone before it was carved. Others speculate the
  serifs were purely an aesthetic addition, put there by the stone carver(s).\r\n\r\nThere
  have been several typefaces that are direct \"revivals\" of the lettering on Trajan's
  Column. The most direct and most popular\u2014and the only one to simply bear the
  name [[Trajan]]\u2014is [[Carol Twombly]] cut for Adobe."
