body: "I have typeset Borges' wonderful short (and I mean <em>short</em>) story \"Borges
  and I\" as a supplement to an article in the online academic journal I'm working
  on. I was hoping the experts here could take a look at what I've done and give me
  any suggestions that come to mind. The single page must be 8 1/2 x 11. Other than
  that, I have no real restrictions.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to consider:\r\n\r\n1.
  I chose Baskerville MT due to the reference to 18th-century typography in the story.
  Any suggestions for something more appropriate? (I have a limited set of fonts to
  work with, but I might be able to purchase something new if it is not too expensive.)\r\n\r\n2.
  Is the initial capital too dark? Is the kerning of the characters around it OK?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\nMatty"

  body: "Actually, my main quibble with what you've got there is, the text measure
    is too wide for optimum reading comfort, even with the generous leading you've
    given it. Aim for a maximum of around 60 characters per line. With the constraint
    of a single 8.5x 11 page, you might consider making the column narrower, pushed
    to the right, with the title and author top left in the resulting wide left margin,
    and the footnote bottom left. You can reduce the leading a bit if necessary to
    fit the text on.\r\n\r\nI like Baskerville and can't complain about that. I think
    the initial cap is fine."

  body: "I suspect it may be the long \"s\" and quaints (ct, st ligatures) which attracts
    that particular Borges to 18th century typography.\r\nTherefore Adobe Caslon would
    be a good choice, as it has a full complement of long-s ligatures.\r\nIf you're
    going to be pretentious, don't be coy.\r\nOr perhaps it is the patina of age that
    appeals, in which case the subtle distress of Founder's Caslon would fit the bill.\r\nIf
    it is the baroque quality of letterform,something from Storm, such as Serapion."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion, Gary. I'll give something like that a try. The
    person for whom I'm working may balk at such a \"radical\" approach, but I'll
    see if I can convince him. (I tried narrowing the measure and keeping it centered
    on the page, but there was just too much white space on either side. Your proposal
    will at least solve that problem.)\r\n\r\nNormally, when I'm stuck working with
    8.5 x 11 paper, I work with a landscape-oriented page and use two columns. But
    I didn't think I could make that work with such a small block of text.\r\n\r\nNick,
    unfortunately I have no idea what aspect of 18th-century typography the narrator
    in Borges' story likes. I think that the long-s's and quaint ligatures would be
    a bit over the top for an academic journal, though. (And so I think I'll just
    continue to assume that he likes the neoclassical orderliness of Baskerville!)\r\n"

    and I\" to look for references to 18th-century texts, which might at least grant
    insight into a fraction of the typography from that era to which he was exposed.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Which would be silly."

  body: "I've replaced the attachment above. This new version (\"Column\") is my first
    crack at the two column layout suggested by Gary. I like the idea, but I don't
    think I've executed it very well. I'm wondering about:\r\n\r\n1. The initial cap.
    Does it clash with the slightly smaller title, which is right next to it?\r\n\r\n2.
    The publication information in the sidenote. Should it be full justified?\r\n\r\n3.
    The vertical placement on the page. Should everything be shifted down?"

  body: I've added yet another version ("Test"), with the text moved down the page
    (and with much less leading). Is there some place else I could or should put the
    title? Lower in the left hand column? Above the text? Centered?

  body: "I like the version better where the beginning of the story is below the title
    and author. I would left justify the title/author sequence as you have with the
    footnote (don't justify that--it's too narrow). In this case I don't see the initial
    cap conflicting with the title. You might pull the title and the text up higher
    on the page, so that the footnote is below the text. This would set the text block
    off better.\r\n\r\nWith the title in roman and the author in italics, I think
    you can dispense with the \"by\", as it's clear this is the title and the author.
    That would elimnate the awkward whitespace created by having \"by\" on its own
    line. Or you could put the \"by\" directly in front of the author's name.\r\n\r\nYou
    could reduce the leading a couple of points in the footnote."
