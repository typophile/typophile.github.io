  body: It looks kind of like what would happen if <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/plantin/">Plantin</a>
    had a baby with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/old-style-7/">
    Bruce Old Style</a>. This type was probably specially designed to be very legible
    at small sizes, which makes it hard to match in digital format, since digital
    types tend to be cut from higher point-size metal types for whatever reason.
