  but I'm not well versed in printing techniques...\r\n\r\nThe high street print shops
  have only standard options, which all look a bit cheap...and also they're not usually
  very environmentally minded. \r\n\r\nLocal print houses have generally done a better
  job but we have always had digital print. One problem here has been 'set-off' \u2014
  where the ink on one card transfers onto the back of the one on top. This is a particular
  problem because our business cards have block colour on the reverse. I don't especially
  want to put a coating/laminate on the card.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering about going offset
  (following Nina's super example <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/70275\">here</a>)
  but we have a 16-colour logo so I'm not sure if that's going to work! I really want
  to get the best results...price is not really so much of an issue.\r\n\r\nI'm based
  in the UK's Southeast in case anyone knows a good local press.\r\n\r\nThanks :)"

  body: Your sixteen-color logo can be reproduced with the four process colors. Offset
    usually occurs when printing on a highly-calendered (very glossy) sheet, and can
    be eliminated by slip-sheeting, although this option is costly because the press
    operator has to insert the slipsheet manually between each press sheet...

  body: I have no experience with digital printing and its problems with offset, but
    with the right offset press and operator you should never see any offset, even
    with full flood printing on extremely coated stock. You could achieve a very nice
    looking card printing four colour process offset but the start-up costs will be
    higher. If you are looking for a large volume it could end up being cheaper.

    cards, not digital. They were printed on non-coated recycled Cocoon stock. The
    company that printed those said it was inevitable unless coating...is that right
    or should I use a different print company and allow more curing time? They said
    \"the ink never really dries actually\".\r\n\r\nIs litho the same as offset? "

  body: "Offsetting if the process of printing (offsetting) from a plate onto a rubber
    blanket and then printing from the ink on that blanket rather than directly from
    the plate. It increases plate life and makes for a crisper print.\r\n\r\nYou can
    offset any kind of printing plate, it doesn't need to be litho, but 99.9% of the
    time in 2010 people talking about offset printing will be referring to offset
    litho.\r\n\r\nPrinting on <em>coated</em> stock without an additional coating
    makes for problems offsetting, but an experienced pressman should be able to avoid
    these. Printing uncoated stock should yield no problems with offsetting between
    cards. I would perhaps try another shop.\r\n\r\nDo you know if there are any large,
    solid areas of any of the process colours (black, cyan, magenta or yellow) on
    the cards?"

  body: "<em>They said \"the ink never really dries actually\".</em>\r\n\r\nThat really
    depends on the total coverage: anything more than 240% (e.g., 60%C 60%M 60%Y 60%K)
    WILL take forever to dry, even if you're on a large press that has uses anti-offset
    spray powder. If your printer is having offset problems with 100% coverage (C90_M10),
    you need to find a new printer."

    as you mention registration becomes impossible. Guess the text could be spot colour

    avoid screening altogether?\r\n\r\nI love letterpress but I've never looked into
    it for business use. Would it normally work out more expensive than offset? (Quantity

    a little to the next card in a stack. Varnish helps, but doesn't completely cure

  body: "> with the right offset press and operator \r\n> you should never see any
    offset\r\n\r\nI agree, I've had many jobs printed via offset printing on glossy
    stock with no varnish and have never had a problem with set-off (unwanted ink
    transfer).  \r\n\r\nAs Nick said, the conversion to 4-color process may cause
    shifting of some colors, and printing in individual flat colors will always give
    superior results in that respect, but with 16 separate colors that would be prohibitively
    expensive.  Years ago cards were seldom printed via 4-color process, but today
    we're seeing many more logos with multiple colors, gradations, etc and 4-color
    cards are much more common. \r\n\r\nJust pick a good-quality print shop. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Letterpress will end up much more expensive. Printing from type is extremely
    time consuming. Digital relief plates for letterpress are many times more expensive
    than offset plates, and makeready on a letterpress is at least as time-consuming
    if not more. The other major factor is that print-shops doing fine letterpress
    work nowadays are few and far between (although there are more and more) and you
    will have to pay a premium for the service.\r\n\r\nHowever, especially when working
    with spot colours, text and uncoated stock, it is a premium you should pay.\r\n\r\nAlso:
    forgive my skepticism, but 16 colours?"

  body: "I do not think digital printers are outfitted to print spot inks, but many
    of them are designed to print with processes that extend past four colour process,
    i.e. they would have 6 or 8 inks to simulate a full range of colours instead of
    four. Many incorporate secondary ink colours like orange, purple and green so
    that the screening that is done is less apparent, only when trying to achieve
    tertiary colours.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong about the spot colour thing, though.
    There are lots of different kinds of digital printers/presses nowadays. Especially
    when it comes to digital, I would call around everywhere you can to get samples."

  body: "As Paul says, inkjet has more than 4 colors.\r\nThing is, you don't need
    many business cards, so printing up a couple hundred, ganged up on A4, wouldn't
    be many sheets.\r\nAs for letterpress, it ain't going away.\r\nThe printers that
    do it (from plates, not just with foundry type) also do embossing, foil, die-cut
    work which there is always a demand for, from graphic designers who appreciate
    the special things.\r\nIt's a great way to rise above the mainstream, where now
    anyone can print in full color at home, school or at work."

  body: "Hi Bendy,\r\nwithout seeing the actual design all I can offer is broad advice.
    \r\nFirst digital vs offest vs letterpress is almost  perfect in terms of quality
    low to high and price low to high.\r\n\r\nDigital is great for low numbers (use
    a Indigo press if you can find one locally). Offset litho is best value  when
    your talking sensible print numbers by this I mean 1000 - 2000 business cards.
    Letterpress while having the highest setup cost gives the most gorgeous finish
    and print quality but you pay for it, not only can you get great flat solid colour
    but you also get an amazing tactile finish (personal recommendation for letterpress
    in the UK is  Glasgow Press).\r\n\r\nYour problems with colour rubbing off is
    pretty common when you print solids in offset, especially when you use blues,
    the only real solution we have come across is to have them matt or gloss laminated,
    this solves the problem but doesn't always give the the finish your after. We've
    had this problems even with just a pure C covering at 100%. \r\n\r\n16 separate
    colours pose no problem for offest or digital, these can even be printed via letterpress
    with a little preparation. \r\nFor best quality you need to get a colour chart
    from your printer on the stock that your going to use, setting this up with gradations
    and colour wheels will give you the most accurate way of picking each colour.\r\n\r\nFor
    letterpress take time to speak to the printer, be prepared to amend your design
    based on their recommendations  for best results.\r\n\r\nFor most vibrant colours
    look to specify spot pantones/hexachromes, you can even specify  4 colour process
    using pantones (bit pricey though).  As far as I am aware digital print, even
    the HP indigos, use 4 colour process + additional colours, you can't specify pantones
    rather they simulate them.\r\n\r\nThe single best bit of advice is to speak to
    your printer and let him know what you want to do, they have the knowledge. Speak
    to local design studios, they will let you know the best local printers, bear
    in mind good printers are never the cheapest and you will have to book your work
    in possibly weeks in advance.\r\n\r\nIf your after quality you need to move away
    from digital and on to litho, screen printing and letterpress. \r\nDigital while
    fantastically versatile is not quite there yet in terms of quality.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nMartin"

  body: "We run two HP Indigo digital presses at the company I work for.\r\n\r\nContrary
    to the comments above, they can run Pantone spot colours.  Our presses run CMYK
    wet ink plus up to two additional Pantone spot colours.  Alternatively they can
    be set to run 'Indichrome' as 6-colours CMYK plus Orange and Violet.  They can
    even be configured to run up to seven colours.\r\n\r\nWe have a really bright
    green (Pantone 368C) installed on the press as one of our clients uses it extensively
    and by running the spot colour we can achieve a very bright clean colour and also
    run 2-colour (Black and Green) jobs as well.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is the Pantone
    colours have to be ordered in pre-mixed and installed into the press, which isn't
    cheap.  So wouldn't be cost effective for just one run of business cards."

  body: At the print shops I've worked for, "digital printing" refers to what is a
    glorified laser printer. Powdered plastic toner (in CMYK) goes on the paper, and
    gets fused down, no worrying about set-off. I've never seen a digital that can
    do spot colors (and orange, by the way, it pretty much impossible to get right.
    It's always muddy.) As mentioned above, there are inkjets that can do certain
    spot colors, though I don't know if there's any high quantity producing inkjets
    out there. (The places I've worked only used them for proofing or very limited,
    wide-format runs. I suspect it would be awfully expensive.
