  body: Your best bet would likely be to visit MyFonts, Veer or FontShop and search
    on the style and enter the "g" to view live samples. Can be tedious but still
    the fastest route I've found to find a specific look to a character.

    just love the letters GQR agt and numbers 2 and 3 in that style. Upon further
    inspection, I quite like that fj ligature as well! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/scotmod_3923.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nForgive
    me, though, for straying from the topic of g. That last curvy one is pretty neat,
    I think."
