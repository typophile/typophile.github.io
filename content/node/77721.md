body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI've been to a couple of printers in town for test prints
  of my new Sensa (forums > critique> sans), but the as far as I can tell from the
  prints I get, the resolution is ok, but it doesn't use the original Adobe postscript
  software. I've been scanning the internet in search for a good laserprinter, but
  it seems that what I need is just too expensive. I will soon be able to afford something
  good, but I wonder if it's wise to spend it all on a laserprinter. I know there
  already are quite a lot of topics about laserprinters on typophile, but I hope someone
  knowes a printer that prints black-white only (should make it a lot cheaper) , 2400
  dpi, and uses original adobe postscript software.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper de Waard"

  body: you might try looking for an old/used Xante printer, assuming that the expendables
    are still available...

  body: "2400 DPI Postscript printers aren\u2019t cheap. For that you have to buy
    a high-end A3/tabloid (or larger) unit from Xerox or Xante, and those are expensive.
    If you are on a tight budget I recommend that you look at the 1200DPI letter/A4
    units from Ricoh. The only drawback I have found with Ricoh is that the toner
    tends to be more expensive than other brands, but that\u2019s because Ricoh uses
    better toner.\r\n\r\nIf you want a tabloid/A3 printer on a small budget watch
    online classifieds for used units. Small businesses are constantly dumping good
    printers because they don\u2019t need them for one reason or another."

    cheap; perhaps eBay.nl (or another European flavor of eBay) has something similar.
    FWIW, back when I worked for a print shop, we always did PostScript testing on
    our Xante: they are remarkably picky about their PostScript, and the slightest
    error will cause them to abort the job."

  body: Xerox Phasers are not 2400dpi but they are affordable & use true Postscript.
    I have one. I use it for design proofing. I like it.
