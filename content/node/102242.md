    different. It IS 'Iambic' by Opti/Castcraft, which is now free and can be found

  body: Holy smokes. So, OPTI fonts are all pirated and poorly digitized, I learn
    from the Typophile archive. And, HVB, that link seems to be broken. We still don't
    know from whom OPTI stole the design for "Iambic." How else might I research this?
    It's not urgent. Thank you to each of you.

  body: "Here is a reference from Luc Devroy's pages:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-50321.html\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Magenta
    (2009, italic display type inspired by Inverserif from Infinitype, which in turn
    has roots in Speedway from FontBank, Concorde from Brendel Informatik, OptiIambic
    from Castcraft, and so forth)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\"Concorde\" is in fact very
    close -if not an exact match- to your sample, but I doubt this is the original
    design as Brendel Informatik is also known for their clones and font forgeries.
    \r\nI just mention it to help you with your investigation."

  body: "Re: OptiFonts. No, they are not ALL  pirated or badly digitized. Iambic is
    at least not badly digitized. But most of them are, and it's often hard to tell
    which is which. As for the others (Thank you Fivos for finding and identifying
    them!) Neither FontBank nor Brendel are known for original designs.  In this case,
    Speedway and OptiIambic both predate Brendel's Concorde.\r\n\r\nDeVroye seems
    to have a handle on the \"original\" as being FontCompany's Inverserif, now available
    from Infinitype (not sure whether Infinitype is a creator or distributor). However,
    Inverserif was/is not available in the oblique form.\r\n\r\nThe Optifonts link
    is peculiar - depending on your ISP, you may need to use a proxy. Oddly, it can
    be accessed via the wayback machine.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
