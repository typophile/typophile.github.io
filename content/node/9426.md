  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a preliminary UC set for a font I&#39;m working on. Rather than
  include a lc, I may just supply a set of alternates. What does everyone think of
  this idea? What do you think of the font? Which glyphs need work? The goal was to
  create a sans based on extremely geometric forms, but that still retains some subtle
  allusions to the pen. <BR> <BR>And if anyone has any good ideas for a name for this
  face I would appreciate suggestions. <BR> <BR>karl. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: newbie-6610.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*5.2*flash+example*newbie%2eswf

    I wouldn&#39;t mind a caps-only font, as long as you have alternates in the uppercase.
    I would put a curl in the &#34;E&#34;, somehow - it&#39;s the most frequent letter
    &#40;in English&#41;, and would spruce things up bigtime. <BR> <BR>Name: Blowsy.
    Dunno why. <BR>Anyway, something that starts with a &#34;B&#34;, for sure. <BR>

  body: '&#34;Augustus Gloop&#34; <BR> <BR>Beautiful. <BR> <BR>I really struggled
    with the G, J and S. Now I&#39;m at a point where I&#39;m not sure what the next
    step is with these characters. I think I can resolve the G, but I don&#39;t know
    what to do with S and J. I originally envisioned a funkier E &#40;thanks Hrant&#41;
    but that plan got scrapped because I couldn&#39;t find a workable solution the
    first time around. Time for phase 2.'

  body: I find the S to be the hardest letterform to get right especially when it
    is part of a whole font &#40;vs. a logo type&#41;  I think you are on a good track
    with the new S, but perhaps it should be a tad more &#34;open&#34;. <BR>As for
    the font as a whole I think it is really nice reminds me of a hybrid between Licko&#39;s
    Dogma and M.V.B&#39;s Bovine. A small cap version would be a nice.

    <BR> <BR>Actually they do dip below the baseline, but maybe they could go a bit
    further. I agree with you, especially about the A. I&#39;ve done some more work
