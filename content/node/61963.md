    M (and W). It looks slightly like an edited version of Hevetica. '

  body: "Helvetica?\r\nI don't think this is an edited \r\nversion of Helvetica. \r\nThe
    starting point was definitely\r\na geometric sans-serif.\r\n\r\nI agree with Barthak\r\nUsing
    Futura, flattening the pointy\r\nendings on the M and cropping the C\r\nwill get
    you pretty close.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
