  body: It's not Times. The name looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/excelsior/">Linotype
    Excelsior</a>, slightly condensed, but the "g" is wrong. The rest looks like some
    form of Bookman, perhaps <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bookman-old-style/">Bookman
    Old Style</a>.

    Serifs of the S are angled here. Not so in Times."
