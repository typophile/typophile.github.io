  Does anyone know of upcoming Typography workshops in the LA area, or evening/weekend
  classes? I'm even open to an online class. I'm in the process of building up a portfolio
  so I can leave the film industry and go back to school for graphic design. Thanks!

    of 2010. There will be quite a few workshops that you can sign up for.

  body: Corey, do you think there are certain books that would be a good substitute
    for a Typography 1 (101) class? I can't find a night or weekend Typography class
    that works with my current schedule at the moment, and would rather start learning
    now as opposed to next semester. I'm more than willing to teach myself if there
    are books that professionals would recommend. Thanks in advance.
