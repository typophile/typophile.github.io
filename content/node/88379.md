  body: I've always been leery of fonts that come as an exe file. Are "fontnameFontInstaller.exe"
    files really safe to download, as is one of the options to download Mathilde Sketch?

  body: "In the page I linked to I only see a .zip download. Anyway, about font installers,
    you should apply the same caution you apply to any installer. Plus, if you\u2019re
    using a font management software and/or you don\u2019t want them installed system-wide,
    you probably will prefer just the file(s)."
