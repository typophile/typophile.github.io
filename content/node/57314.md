  body: "Are the sheets imposed? The perfect binding process really requires signatures,
    ideally of 16 pages, but eights and fours are possible. I don't know how you could
    sew single sheets (two pages). I certainly wouldn't want to warranty pages against
    falling out with singles.\r\n\r\nThat said, why not call a university library.
    Many university graduate programs require bound theses, and thus those places
    should (might) know where to get it done."

    it trims the spine folds off? And where does sewing come into it?

    that sounds like <a href=\"http://www.graphateria.com/Products_Binding.htm\">saddle

    would be to do \"tape\" binding.\r\n\r\nyou _could_ pad the book and have lulu.com

    how it works for new users.\r\n\r\nThey do not do one-offs. I know this is what
    the original poster asked about. But I was replying only to the general assertion
    that perfect binding of fewer than 20 pages was not possible.\r\n\r\nAs far as
    short-run digital printing of books, BookMobile is among the best in the business.\r\n\r\npowers"

    kids books who otherwise wouldn't ever make it to the real thing. Kinda like a
    big ice cream truck, except for books. And less creepy.
