body: Client uses Futura as "corporate font." Futura body text is a bear. Need alternative.
  Must be in synch with innovation theme.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2001Style_B_3637.jpg]\r\n\r\nI find it
    rather quaint.\r\nNonetheless, very few type designers have subsequently had the
    balls to be as ruthlessly reductive as Renner.\r\nSo no doubt that vision of the
    future sits well with corporate innovation."

  body: I agree with Nick, that Futura definitely does NOT look innovative.  It's
    very evocative of a distinct time/place/aesthetic, which happens to be the late
    1920's, not the late 2020's.

  body: I think I need a beer. I'm actually agreeing with you two in a sense. Based
    on what I have seen of what big-corp calls 'innovative', putting that moniker
    on Futura would be both slanderous and offensive, IMAO.

    poster is also evocative of c.1970 in the way that the face is set tight-but-not-touching.\r\nSo
    perhaps there is some new crazy-shit way to set Futura that screams CORPORATE
    INNOVATION 2011 BABY!!!\r\n\r\nI nominate Contextual Alternates to mix up several
    weights in the same setting, in the manner of the Schwartz/Leming Local Gothic,
    or PFP's Anisette."

  body: "Michelle, apologies for hijacking your post, and I did note that you put
    \"corporate\" in ironic quotes.\r\n\r\nHow about Beton?\r\n\r\nIt was the Bauer
    foundry's \"Futura Slab Serif\".\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/beton/t-demi/\r\n\r\nIt
    actually sets very nicely as running text, not overly slabby, due to some subtle
    details, and I've seen it used recently as a news text face, quite successfully.\r\n\r\nIt
    would also continue the back-to-the-future theme of Futura -- but only for those
    who know! \r\nLay folk would consider it quite contemporary and, uh, innovative,
    in the way that the squarish Eurostile and Bankers Gothic signify computer technology."

  body: "I think Futura is way more timeless than most typefaces, actually. Futura
    allcaps are some of the most beautiful letters I know. Of course the are typical
    for an era as well, but so is helvetica or baskerville or scala. I have seen books
    with body copy in futura done quite succesfully actually, but it needs a fine
    sense of proportion. \r\n\r\nA Futura with optical sizes does seem like a great
    idea though, perheps with some alternates for letters like the lower case t. Then
    again you might also go for avenir, which is supposed to be a better futura.\r\n\r\nAs
    for a companion. Perhaps Silica or Museo Slab would work? Or a modern serif font
    like Charter? I would not go for another sans-serif."

  body: "<em> Futura body text is a bear.</em>\r\n\r\nDepends entirely on how you're
    setting it; some designers would seize on this limitation and turn it into a virtue.
    If you can't see your way to this, perhaps you need 'alternative client'."

    don't think anyone is disputing that. I think it is safe to say, though, that
    Futura definitely connotes \"Early 20th Century\", and not the future, innovation,
    etc, which is what it sounds like the client is asking for."

  body: "Problem is that typefaces can not speak of the future, as they are made today,
    or were made some time ago. A typeface can be innovative in a way, but it would
    be wrong to try to make the typeface (especially the body copy one) scream future,
    as this will result in some kind of science fiction, and we all know how dated
    they look after a while. Eurostyle would be my best be if you want to pursue this
    direction. \r\n\r\nBut rather I would opt for a typeface that is fresh and new,
    which represents todays typeface fashion without being silly. Something like Sense
    by Nick Shinn, which is inspired by geometric faces like futura but updates it
    for today, might be a good bet. I have no idea if this would go well with futura
    though. But maybe there is a way to convince your client that this might be a
    better choice. Otherwise try to set futura is such a way that it looks fresh and
    new again. Many intelligent designers have made a rather common typeface work
    for them, giving it a new voice. I guess you are lucky to have Futura to work
    with, as it could have been a lot worse (Bauhaus, Eurostyle, Blippo, Digital or
    something as awful as that...)"
