  body: It's <strong>very</strong> interesting, but has severe legibility problems.
    And I'm also not sure about these thin outlines. This will make it problematic
    on some applications.

    especially the _t_.

    it may need to revert back to hand some ''kinder'' edges like the drawing? I will
    get that line thicker - what do you see as being the ''problem characters'' with
    legibility? '

  body: "Well keep in mind that this is coming from someone who still can't read or
    write cursive, but... I guess if I had to narrow it down, aside from the /t/ there's
    the /d/ and /ol/ that might be hard to differentiate. The /u/ and /v/ actually
    differentiate surprisingly well, but of course I already know what it says. The
    amount of delay for someone to read it is probably very small, however. It's just
    that, as a logo, <em>I</em> feel it should be quickly legible (though there seems
    to be a trend away from legibility in logos).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple things
    that are kind of weird in the design of it\u2014the narrowness of the /d/ and
    the space in /le/...or maybe it's the width of /e/. That /t/ might actually work
    if the circle were lowered a bit.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I understand all your decisions,
    they all seem reasonable, and it <em>looks really good</em> overall, so I hesitate
    to critique it too harshly.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of small sizes and line thickness,
    you could produce a non-outlined version for small applications. "

  body: I like the outlined version. Without the outline it does look a bit like "vialet"
    because the o connects to the l in the conventional place for a script a. You
    might need to have some subtle differences between the outlined and non-outlined
    one because I also think you need to do something to open the bottom of e a bit.

  body: Now these are much better. I like the outlined as well, although I would make
    the descender of /q/ to go from the circle and not behind... The same thing with
    /d/.

  body: "Thanks for comments - I tried the 'flow' of q and d as litera suggested.\r\n\r\nAlso
    applied a bit of colour and a logo mark (as requested by client). Ithink it looks
    nicer without the mark. Almost impossible to get a generic mark for the company.
    Tried referencing droplets. \r\n\r\nThink im scraping the filled in approach.
    Any thoughts please? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liquidviolet_stage2_1_4308.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liquidviolet_stage2_2_4753.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liquidviolet_stage2_3_5320.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liquidviolet_stage2_4_6024.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liquidviolet_stage2_5_5731.jpg]"

  body: "I'm sad to see the much more unique wordmark go, but this is definitely clearer.
    Except that in the solid version, the /o/ does look like an /a/. Why not cut into
    the letters where the lines in the other version are necessary for readability?
    Kind of like <a href=\"http://fontfabric.com/val-font/\">VAL</a> does on a lot
    of characters because it's so fat.\r\n\r\nDisconnecting the /t/ does make the
    /e/ clearer, but it seems, well, disconnected. Especially since the negative space
    there is larger than between the two words.\r\n\r\nAs for the mark, could you
    make it more like a stylized violet (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Viola_odorata_001.JPG\">viola
    odorata</a>)? I don't know if that would be appropriate (I don't even know what
    the company is besides \"a young\") but given the vague connotations of stylized
    flowers, I doubt it would be <em>in</em>appropriate."

    still using the same style/idea. \r\n\r\nThe company is a sound production company,
    i forgot to complete explanation above. \r\nThey record dialogue for gaming companies.
    They are a young group coming to work together from other companies. \r\nThere
    are 3 of them (hence the liquid violet 3 pronged mark). \r\n\r\nI like the comments
    of joining O and L on top, i'll take that on."

  body: "An interesting concept, but is too literal in its geometry. This happens
    all the time with this kind of lettering: lines on a grid in illustrator plus
    a fat round stroke. In order to work well, they require all manner of subtle trickery
    to keep from clogging. Specifically, the horizontal strokes should be thinner
    than the vertical, and you need to thin out the joints. Lastly the spacing needs
    work. Notice the counter space and width of the round letters is much larger than
    the counter and space between ui etc. Try and harmonize these a bit better.\r\n\r\nI've
    attached two typefaces I've designed that may help you attack the problem of Heavy+Geometric.
    It's a tricky beast. Good luck!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Artwork-2_5594.jpg]"

    use the contour lines to separate the individual characters. For example, the
