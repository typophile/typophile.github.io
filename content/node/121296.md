  font editor software, or at least a free one, for my students. \r\nWhich one would
  you recommend? \r\nI must confess that I tried FontForge but find it very slow and
  confusing (maybe because it runs on a mac\u2026?). \r\nSomething more simple, for
  newbies type designers, would be perfect! I just want them to experimented type
  design: it doesn't need to be extensive.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help!"

    TypeTool and Glyphs Mini are both inexpensive options, less than $50 USD."

    a few,* but personally haven\u2019t had time to determine their quality.\r\n\r\n*
    There also is fontstruct.com, but, while it could be a fun and instructive tool,
    I don\u2019t think it would be a real first step into font editors."

    for Windows and Mac (and an older version is also available for Linux), and is
    generally considered 'easy-to-use' (as far as font editors go). The freeware version
    has only basic drawing tools though.\r\n\r\n[[http://cr8software.net/typelight.html]]

  body: "FontForge is acutally as mighty as FontLab, but certain builds of it are
    very crashy. I work in it on both Mac and Windows, works good. If you have X11
    or XQuartz installed, you can get a premade build here :\r\n[[http://fuuko.libferris.com/osx/packages/]].\r\nThen
    just open X11, then open FontForge, should work nice (but not like a native app).\r\n\r\nOn
    Windows you can find a build here:\r\n[[http://fontforgebuilds.sourceforge.net/]]"
