body: 'When thinking of my home state, Louisiana, I think of it more like an island,
  seperate from the rest of the country. Our laws, our culture, our politics, are
  very different from those belonging to the rest of the United States. At times,
  I also feel that the rest of the country, the federal government especially, sees
  us in that way as well. It seems as though the only time some of the rest of the
  country thinks of Louisiana is in relation to  "the storm" or the corruption that
  our state government is known for. Other than the two things I mentioned, no one
  else in the rest of the country really knows what it''s like in this state. Just
  like any other exotic vacation spot, people come Louisiana to see all of the touristy
  things and get a reprieve from their regular, mainland lives and then they just
  leave. It''s like when I go to cancun or belize, I go to live in a state of debauchery
  for a few days and then I can always return home (although my home is not so different
  than those spots I vacation to).Although it seems like we go it alone for many things
  in this state, I think it''s what makes us such a resilient and cultured people. '
