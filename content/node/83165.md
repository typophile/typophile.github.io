  won't tell us what fonts they used so we can't match the menus and name cards. \r\nI
  would love if someone could help me ID both the fonts used - I have deleted our
  names and numbers so sorry for the weird gaps. \r\n\r\nOh and with the non cursive
  font - they changed the size of some of the fonts which is why they don't all look
  the same size from line to line. \r\n\r\nThanks so much!! "
