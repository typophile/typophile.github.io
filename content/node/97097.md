body: "Dear buddies\r\n\r\nSome time ago I had tested trying to build a font using
  makeotf-afdko \r\n<code>(Font, Version 1.002;PS 1.001;hotconv 1.0.57;makeotf.lib2.0.21895
  DEVELOPMENT)</code> \r\nAll of supporting data required has been edited from the
  source file example Adobe \"minionpro\". The process of generating fonts was successfully
  and font can be used at least in windows xp. But after I checked this font microsoft
  font validator, there are some pretty annoying error messages as follows:\r\n\r\ninto
  file: <strong>feature size </strong>\r\n<em>actually I haven't yet understand about
  the values of parameter, So I put them with random value, and It is succesfully
  generating error into Microsoft Font Validator (MFV) reviews :)</em>\r\n\r\n<code><dt>feature
  size {</dt>\r\n <dd>parameters 150 3 65 84;\r\n     sizemenuname \"Regular\";\r\n
  \    sizemenuname 1 \"Italic\";</dd>\r\n<dt>} size;</dt></code>\r\n\r\nThe MFV review
  as follow:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fea-Size_4913.png]\r\n\r\ninto
  file: <strong>feature family</strong>\r\n<em>I put these:</em>\r\n<code><dt>feature
  ss01 { # Stylistic Set 1\r\n # Latin\r\nfeatureNames {</dt>\r\n<dd>\tname 3 \"Windows
  descriptive name for stylistic set 01\";\r\n\tname 1 \"Mac descriptive name for
  stylistic set 01\";\r\n\tname 3 1 0x40c \"Windows descriptive name for stylistic
  set 01\";\r\n\tname 1 0 1 \"Mac descriptive name for stylistic set 01\";</dd>\r\n<dt>};\r\nlookup
  ss012 {</dt>\r\n<dd>    sub @salt1' [@allnum @all_lc @liga_lc @QUOTE @acute]  by
  @salt2;</dd>\r\n<dt>} ss012;</dt>\r\n<dd>    language AZE ; # Azeri ................</dd>\r\n<dt>lookup
  ss012; \r\n} ss01;</dt></code>\r\n\r\nThe MFV review as follow:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SS01_3459.png]\r\n\r\ninto
  file <strong>\"features\"</strong>:\r\n<em>I put these:</em>\r\n<code><dt>table
  OS/2 {</dt>\r\n<dd>\tTypoAscender 750;\t# Top of Ascenders\r\n\tTypoDescender -250;\t#
  TypoAscender UPM\r\n\tXHeight 500;\r\n\tCapHeight 680;\r\n\tWeightClass 700;\t#
  Bold\r\n\tVendor \"camp\";\r\n\tFSType 8;\t\t# Editable embedding\r\n\tPanose 2
  0 8 5 2 0 0 9 0 4;</dd>\r\n<dt>} OS/2;</dt>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n(note: Previously
  I put the information \"width 3;\" below \"CapHeight 680;\", but failed to read
  by makeotf-afdko, so I treat with suspicion that afdko will give value automatically)\r\n\r\nand
  here is the MFV error:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TableOS2_3921.png]\r\n\r\nCan
  someone enlightening me?. Thank you in advance for your help and answers slightest.\r\n\r\nBest
  Regards\r\nAndi aw. masry"

  body: I can comment on the last of these. Font Validator has not been updated since
    the version of the OT spec in which the most recent OS/2 version number was 3,
    so it simply doesn't recognise the version 4 string that the latest AFDKO uses
    as default.

  body: "I think FontValidator does not understand human readable names for ss01-ss20.
    (To be honest none application does)\r\nBTW  there is newer AFDKO see: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/new-afdko-version.html"

  body: "<strong>Thank you !!\r\nApparently I missed the plane :)</strong>\r\non the
    feature size, can anyone explain the basis for determining parameters such as:\r\n<code>\"parameters
    150 3 65 84\"</code> \r\nAs I was getting at above, the numbers I wrote with random
    parameter, but it turns out makeotf not give an error message. So it seems fine.
    But I want to make sure to count or basics of logic determining these figures.
    Can anyone help?\r\nBst regards\r\n"
