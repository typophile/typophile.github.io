body: "Any tips on how to stylise Japanese characters for a logo?\r\nWhat I basically
  want to know is how much of the characters can be stylised? Eg. if you make the
  curves straight, is it still legible or do you run the risk of involuntarely producing
  other characters?\r\nI'm starting with Japanese Hiragana, but wouldn't want to end
  up with something that would read a whole other thing in Katana."

  body: "My understanding is that there is very little room for play with Japanese
    characters. Someone once told me that there are only a few fonts used on Japanese
    signs since the subtlety and complexity of the characters greatly narrows the
    stylistic options for font designers.\r\n\r\nFor the greatest legibility you will
    probably have to consult with fluent reader or maybe even a group of them. \r\n\r\nAnother
    option could be limiting your scope to a smaller character set. If you are only
    designing Hiragana and Katakana then you would presumably have more room to play
    than if you are trying to design several thousand characters.\r\n\r\nYou may want
    to consider Japanese similar to the roman alphabet. If you are looking to make
    a highly readable, body-text typeface then your creative options become much more
    narrow. However, if style precludes crystal clear legibility then that is just
    a choice you have to make. \r\n\r\nHope that helps,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "I've been looking for some Japanese Hiragana fonts on the internet & indeed
    there doesn't seem to be much room for stylising the characters. I am however
    only doing 5 characters which will be used only in addition to a spelled out version,
    so legibility is not prior on my list. I'd like to make a display Hiragana, but
    my main worry is that I might be creating different characters in the process.\r\nMaybe
    the best thing to do is to have a go at it & then post the result here hoping
    a fluent Japanese reader can decipher it ;-)"

  body: me too. shouldn't be hard to keep either in hiragana's or katakana's respective
    alphabets. there's a little bit of overlap but since it will be a word and not
    individual characters any japanese reader should easily tell the difference.

    think there's more room for play than one might first believe. However, \"pushing\"
    any writing system always requires nativity. Ergo: recruit a Japanese type designer
    (or at least graphic designer) to help you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "When I was learning to write Hiragana and Katakana it was explained to me
    that Hiragana should be written with more \"sweeping\" strokes while Katakana
    should have more even \"rigid\" strokes. It helped me to think of Hiragana strokes
    as brush strokes and Katakana strokes as pen strokes. I guess the point is that
    according to native speakers even though the characters do overlap there are stylistic
    diferences that signify the differences. For example \u304B (Hiragana) & \u30AB
    (Katakana) are both \"ka\" in the same font.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "Another significant difference to note -- especially if you are looking to
    focus on a certain word -- is how Hiragana and Katakana are meant to be used for
    different types of words. For example, Katakana is used to transcribe foreign
    words. Wikipedia has some pretty good information about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana\">Katakana</a>
    usage and history.\r\n\r\nHope I'm not telling you too many things you already
    know. It's not often that I have the opportunity talk about this stuff. \r\n\r\nDuncan"

    I am assuming that is a \u3070, right? it is difficult to tell whether the straight
    line goes with the piece before it or after it. Maybe if the characters weren't
    spaced so close together...?\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    body: "I find the characters perfectly easy to read.  It did take a moment to
      recognise the <em>word</em>, but that's only because it's normally written with
      katakana (and a small \u3087/\u30E7).\r\n\r\nThis is fine for a logo.  You could
      stylise a <em>lot</em> further and remain quite safe.\r\n\r\n(To answer the
      initial question of whether it's possible to do Japanese with straight lines,
      the answer is of course yes.  The <a href=\"http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/views/View_HeartFontbyzEn.html\">results</a>
      may be rather hideous, but it remains as legible as a similar approach to the
      Roman alphabet would be.)"

    huge & maybe spacing the last two glyphs more?
