body: "I've been designing fonts for about a year now, pure hobby. I've always felt
  that, because I was never properly educated in type design, I'm missing out on a
  lot of stuff. Nevertheless I try. In the last weeks I've come up with this design,
  inspired on the beautiful typefaces by Gerard Unger. Like his type, I'd like to
  give it a feel of (post) modernism and clarity.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I'm not a professional,
  not even an educated type designer. However, I'd like you all to comment, good and
  bad...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "You've either made superb progress in type design over just a year, or you're
    staying too close to Unger*. He's a great role model in type, but I still think
    most individuals can contribute much more from themselves than from imitation.
    The question of what's too close for comfort is a classic and thorny issue in
    type design, and requires great introspection as well as listening to advice.
    But quite possibly I'm making a mountain out of a molehill!\r\n\r\n* I'm not an
    expert in Unger's work so I can't pinpoint too much.\r\n\r\nAnyway, of itself
    it's quite nice.\r\nThe weakest glyph is the \"j\" - it needs a braver descender.\r\n\r\nConcerning
    self-education: many of our great names in the craft have been self-taught. There
    are pros and cons (just as there are with formal education) but I have to think
    that in this age of 100,000 fonts it nicely promotes originality. The main problem
    is that you can take a few extra years to get to the same spot (although the journey
    might very well be the biggest prize).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I like what you've done so far. I'd make only one comment for now. I wonder
    if the descender are a bit too long. I think it is longer than the ascender and
    it could be a bit shorter. It's more visible in the y and the g. Keep going.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    work more on the a - it looks clumsy to me. \r\n\r\nDiagonal letters like wxv
    (not always easy to do) are well done here."
