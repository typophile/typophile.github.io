    Many people, whose native language is Arabic, also understand English or French
    - and even without that, but an interest in typography as a subject, there's no
    inherent reason why they couldn't have the judgment to choose popular and tasteful
    typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of Comic Sans and Papyrus over here shows,
    however, that being a native speaker of English is no guarantee of typographic
    taste when it comes to one's own script. Given that, I think someone from another
    script tradition has... farther to fall... if he stumbles around unaided.\r\n\r\nI
    mean, really. <strong>Why</strong> would someone use Algerian for such a heading?
    Given that he wasn't deliberately trying to be silly, like someone over here would
    almost have to be, but really, genuinely, and sincerely, didn't know any better?\r\n\r\nMy
    guess is that he wanted to achieve the kind of effect that one would get from,
    say, Albertus or Trajanus.\r\n\r\nBut he was unaware of Western <em>fashions</em>,
    and used an aesthetic informed by Arabic artwork in Egypt. So he probably sincerely
    thought that Algerian would have impressed people favorably as a dignified typestyle
    suitable for the web site of an important personage or department.\r\n\r\nWe can
    laugh, because the result is so jarring to our eyes - but in an absolute sense,
    the choice wasn't inherently wrong, any more than, say, the typography on the
    front of 19th century sheet music is wrong. They did what looked good in the eyes
    of people then, given the fashions of the time.\r\n\r\nSo, a man from Mars, with
    only 19th-century examples of English display text to guide him, might do as badly.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    my own participation in the forum on Hebrew typography might make it seem odd
    that I would make such a statement.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see myself as an expert;
    instead, I have questions and want to learn.\r\n\r\nTo my eyes, using an aesthetic
    informed by fashions in the Latin alphabet world, there are things that seem strange
    in the Hebrew script world.\r\n\r\nFrank-Ruhl seems to me to be horribly dated,
    while Siddur-type typefaces look like the timeless canonical forms of the letters.
    But it's Frank-Ruhl that is the \"Times Roman\" of Israel.\r\n\r\nCalligraphic
    faces are just about <em>never</em> used for body copy in the Latin script. Particularly
    - but not exclusively - for religious texts, they're commonly used for Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThese
    differences in fashions between script communities are fascinating to me... but
    they're also evidence that typeface aesthetics can differ widely between script
    communities. I can't assume that in China, Korea, and Japan... or in Israel...
    or in Egypt, the visual language of typography will be the same - presumably set
    down for all the world for a given year (as opposed to it being something significantly
    different as much as ten years ago) by the typographical equivalent of a few Paris
    coutouriers."

  body: "Indeed, I didn't mean it jingoistically. What I should have somehow clarified
    is this:\r\n\r\nOf course people whose native script is the Arabic script could
    still be excellent judges of typographical taste for Latin-script typography.
    But they wouldn't have been born that way. They would have to get the information
    on which such an ability is based from the outside.\r\n\r\nThus, I wasn't trying
    to accuse Egyptians of an inherent incapacity.\r\n\r\nWhat, instead, I was noting
    was this: people living in Egypt are not necessarily surrounded by contemporary
    examples of Western languages typeset according to Western norms, fashions, and
    aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThus, I can't assume that a random man in the street in Egypt
    is going to know that Algerian looks funny and out-of-date to most Americans and
    most Frenchmen and so on.\r\n\r\nNow, one might say, though, that I ought to expect
    that people would realize that typography is an important part of web design,
    and thus, unless I thought Egyptians were stupid or something, an Egyptian called
    upon to make an English-language web page would make it his business to find out
    about Latin-script typography.\r\n\r\nThere are <em>two</em> answers to this.\r\n\r\nOne
    is to simply point to the many typographic horrors perpetrated on web sites by
    people who can plead no language barrier in their defense. I can expect someone
    who sets up a web site to know HTML, or how to use Dreamweaver or a similar tool.
    Beyond that, nothing can be taken for granted.\r\n\r\nThe other is to note that
    Egypt is a non-Western country. Not only isn't it the United States, it isn't
    Israel or Japan either. While you can definitely find fonts of Arabic display
    typefaces on the Web, it is also true that the aesthetic of Arabic typography
    is largely based on manuscript hands that have remained static for hundreds of
    years.\r\n\r\nSo many people in Egypt, for cultural reasons, simply would not
    have the in-built assumption that fashions in typography change every 50 years
    or so, and the availability of a font for a typeface does not automatically mean
    that it is generally usable without inviting ridicule.\r\n\r\nI figure that whoever
    picked Algerian did so because it looked nice to him.\r\n\r\nDifferent culture,
    different aesthetics - and a lack of a cosmopolitan mentality to lead to automatically
    thinking, \"Gee, I better check, to see what these people currently think is fashionable\".\r\n\r\nSo,
    while it's all right to have a chuckle at the quaint and inappropriate choice
    of a typeface - I suspect that there's a lot in the way of extenuating circumstances
    that reduce blame. Not to nonexistence. Just enough to say - one shouldn't be
    surprised if this sort of thing occasionally happens when people in sufficiently
    remote parts are trying to communicate to a culture they may not understand well
    in places."

    symbols and expressions is extremely interesting, but then I am an ethnomusicology
    student by day. In my field there are countless examples of this kind of \"transculturation\"
    - one geographically distinct group trying to emulate another and constructing
    something new in the process. For example, a lot of African popular music from
    the 60s-90s bears a strong connection to a \"bad\" version of Cuban rumba made
    in Zaire in the 50s - except of course it's not bad at all, in fact highly creative
    and interesting, because of the complete reinterpretation of the music and the
    injection of lots of new elements. It's only \"bad\" by Cuban rumba standards!\r\n\r\nSo
    I'm wondering whether there's not a value (at the very least an anthropological
    interest!) in a lot of colloquial reinterpretations of latin writing by users
    of other writing systems. The fact that many of those who've learned Arabic script
    as their first writing system have a certain relation to handwriting in Latin
    script (just look at Arabic and Persian-language protest signs and their relatively
    uniform \"mistakes\") I find extremely interesting. I wonder if there's not something
    of aesthetic value to be taken from there as well?"
