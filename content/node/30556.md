    person thing even wanted to get one even though he had no idea what 'kerning'
    was. I had to explain. \r\n\r\nAnd that's the great thing about the top: for the
    first time in my life I\u2019m having conversations about kerning that haven\u2019t
    been started by me! People see the word and just have to ask what it means, which,
    while I have no complaints, I do find somewhat surprising. I would have expected
    people to assume it was just some brand like 'FCUK' or \u2018GAP\u2019, and not
    even think to ask, but they do.\r\n\r\nOh, and there's <a href=\"http://www.letterbox.net.au/research/res_typo_herald.html\">a

    day, the owner had to fire one of his waiters. Later that night, the fired waiter
    returned to steal the two beautiful wooden signs outside the restaurant. \r\n\r\nHe
    never did say what he did with them. The police searched his house and all the
    nearby dumpsters.\r\n\r\nI felt bad for the cafe, each sign to replace was about
    $2200 each. The signs had no value to anyone but the cafe. And yes, he had insurance,
    but a huge deductible. \r\n\r\nTo make new signs took several weeks. At the time
    I had a 36 inch poster maker, so we made quick ones placed on poster board and
    laminated to hold up in the weather. Funny, everyone knows the cafe is there --
    on the corner of an intersection, but without the signs, folks just couldn't find
    it. Amazing...\r\n\r\nSo sometimes, they just get stolen for spite."
