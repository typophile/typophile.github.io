body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI've just been scanning through the licenses for several fonts
  I own, specifically the Helvetica Neue & Trade Gothic families. Admittedly, I get
  easily confused by reading legal-speak, but it almost sounds as though the license
  doesn't allow me to use the font commercially - i.e. in design work that I am paid
  for... <em>surely</em> this isn't the case...\r\n\r\nThis bit in particular is confusing:\r\n\r\n<em><strong>\"Personal
  or Internal Business Use\"</strong> shall mean Use of the Font Software for your
  customary personal or internal business purposes and shall not mean any distribution
  whatsoever of the Font Software or any component or Derivative Work thereof... </em>\r\n\r\n<em>...You
  are hereby granted a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable (except as
  expressly permitted herein) license to access the Font Software (i) only in a Licensed
  Unit, (ii) <strong>only for your Personal or Internal Business Use</strong>, and...</em>\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas what this actually means in the real world? I <em>can</em> still use these
  fonts for paid design work, right?\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\nDee\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You do not own the fonts. You own a license to use the \"Font Software\"
    for Personal and Internal Business Use\r\n\r\nThe EULA is referring to the \"Font
    Software\". So if use the \"Font Software\" to create documents or designs where
    the \"Font Software\" stays under the internal control of the number of workstations
    it was licensed for, you have no problem using the \"Font Software\" for paid
    design work. If you use the \"Font Software\" in a product, such as an e-book
    or in some other situation where the embedding of the \"Font Software\" becomes
    part of a \"Commercial Product\", then you have a problem."

  body: "Terminaldesign: many thanks for the reply. Much appreciated. Apologies, understand
    I don't 'own' the fonts, but only a license for use as you say - just a bad choice
    of words.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to decide whether or not to use one of those fonts
    for a paid design project. It's a printed document, so that's okay from a licensing
    point of view. \r\n\r\nBut the client mentioned something about being able to
    put the electronic version of the document on their website (PDF) as a free download.
    Obviously, the fonts would be embedded as a subset in the PDF.\r\n\r\nI see this
    happening <strong>all the time</strong> on other websites - but I'm wondering:
    is it actually permitted?\r\n\r\nAnd is this type of thing worth being concerned
    about in reality?\r\n\r\nThanks again"

    Software into electronic documents or Internet pages is only permitted under the
    absolute assurance that the recipient cannot use the Font Software to edit or
    create a new document (read-only). It must be ensured that the Font Software cannot
    be fully or partially extracted from said documents.\u201D\r\n\r\nand 1.6: \r\n\u201CThe
    licensee may electronically distribute Font Software embedded in a document <em>for
    Personal or Internal Business Use</em> only when the Font Software embedded in
    such document is in a static graphic image (for example, a \u201Cgif\u201D) or
    an embedded electronic document, and is distributed in a secure format that permits
    only the viewing and printing (and not the editing, altering, enhancing, or modifying)

  body: "Hey there frode frank, \r\n\r\nYou mean you don't get '<em>for Personal or
    Internal Business Use</em>' ? \r\n\r\nI actually called Monotype about this earlier
    just out of curiosity, and they told me that embedding those fonts is okay as
    long as the PDF isn't being sold. I explained that it would simply be a free online
    version of my client's printed document - they said this was fine.\r\n\r\nStill,
    I'm having a hard time equating what they've told me on the phone with what's
    written in the EULA.\r\n\r\nDo licensed users ever actually get into trouble for
    font embedding? Seems really complicated..\r\n\r\nThanks"
