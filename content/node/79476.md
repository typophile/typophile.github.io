body: "Dear friends, my research (Mphil) has come to an end. It seems now that the
  writing of 200 pages was nothing compared to the difficulty of designing a decent
  cover. I\u2019m a graduated graphic designer but I haven\u2019t practiced for a
  long time. Can you please advise me? Here\u2019s the spread. The image I choose
  is a drawing by the great Gordon Cullen (1950s) which is one of the architects I
  investigate. It shows a very cluttered \u201Csubtopian\u201D landscape, the problem
  is that there\u2019s not much white space left for the information I have to provide
  (my name, title and possibly EESC USP Universidade de S\xE3o Paulo). I chose this
  typeface because many of the texts I analyse in the research were typewritten...silly?
  thanks everyone.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cov_3675.jpg]"

    the attention it needs. Your options are to make the illustration smaller and
    put the head outside of it, or to put the headline in a box (or other shape) the
    overlays part of the illustration. \r\n\r\nWhat size is the cover, what is the
    binding method, and on which edge is it bound? Can you use color?\r\n\r\nI probably
    wouldn't use the typewriter face. It looks dated and your report is an analysis,
    not an attempt to replicate a retro look."

    clone out the poles, wires and tarmac.\r\nYou might even consider removing the
    horizontal telephone wires (but not the TV aerial!)\r\n\r\nThe typewriter face
    would be OK, but it would have to be display size."

  body: "Hi Nick...I just saw your message. Hope you're well! I kind of found a solution.
    I still have to insert the university name so I'll do as you say and try to cheat.
    Thanks a lot. \r\nThanks James, you're right, no need to replicate the retro look
    but I was too tempted! Here in our school they're not too strict about academic
    norms for covers, since all information will be inside anyway. It's not a commercial
    issue, it's just the copy I have to submit for the final review. \r\nColour: definetely.

  body: "I know little about academic book publishing, marketing or selling. Nor am
    I up-to date on architectural books. Nor do I know the target audience here.  So
    what I say may not apply to this book. And now that I have seen the original poster's
    second message, it definitely doesn't apply to this book. But I'm going to post
    it anyway.\r\n\r\nFor books which will not be sold in bookstores, but rather on
    the internet including Amazon, the whole point of the book cover is to look good
    as a postage-stamp-and-a-half sized icon on Amazon or on any other website. Sadly,\r\n
    the complicated and intricate book cover, which looks beautiful in the bookstore,
    is going away. For the Amazon-sized icon you need wide readable letters for the
    title and author's name, along with a simple graphic. This is the way we live
    now.\r\n\r\nRe: the font on the cover, the author's perspective does not matter.
    What is the reader/customer's perspective here?"
