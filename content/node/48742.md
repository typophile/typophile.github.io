body: "I'm currently working on getting my physical portfolio updated (it's been about
  5 years and I have a lot of work to go through), but I'm also doing an online version
  (Behance.net, very easy to use) which I've never had. \r\n\r\nSo, my question. In
  this day and age, is having a physical portfolio still important? Can I get away
  with just an online one? I'm finding that the online one can include things that
  the physical can't, including more of my work. However, the physical one is nice
  to show off some of the more 3-dimensional designs I've done, but it's limited in
  both size and amount to work to include.\r\n\r\nI'm primarily a print designer with
  little web experience (but I'd like to expand hopefully). I'm looking for a new
  job, but I'm getting antsy because I feel really behind with my portfolios. I'm
  coming across all these great openings I'd like to apply at, but am holding off
  until I have either one finished (is that wrong?). It's been a while since I've
  done this and I feel really behind the curve. I'm excited though, this is a chance
  to get into a place that I'll love working at! \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd love to hear
  opinions for both sides. In the meantime, I'm going to keep working on these portfolios.
  It's a lot of work, but I feel certain expectations still apply. "

  body: I think the two can be used to complement each other. I currently only have
    a physical portfolio but like you have been thinking about creating one on line.
    I fear that I may seem out of date by not having a web site. For a print designer
    I see it like an appetizer. Someone can get a good sense of your style and body
    of work.  But the real meat is the physical portfolio, it is so important to see
    the piece as printed. And start applying to openings that pique your interest,
    nothing else will motivate you like having a job interview scheduled. Best of
    luck - K
