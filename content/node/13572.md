body: "[[TypeOff]] has just produced its first T-Shirt, and I am giddy happy.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=34\">See the design here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe design
  is an homage to [[Experimental Jetset]], whose Beatles T-Shirt drove two members
  of our collective bonkers. Of course, the design is just as much of an homage to
  the four type designers whose names it bears: \r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[[Walter Tiemann]]\r\n(1876\u20131951)
  Typographer and Professor from Leipzig. Designed typefaces for the [[Klingspor]]
  foundry in Offenbach, e.g., Tiemann Antiqua.\r\n\r\n[[Otto Eckmann]]\r\n(1865\u20131902)
  Painter and commercial artist. Designed [[Eckmann]] for the [[Ruhard]] foundry in
  Offenbach.\r\n\r\n[[Karlgeorg Hoefer]]\r\n(1914\u20132000) Calligrapher and professor
  at the [[HfG Offenbach]]. Designed [[Salto]] for the [[Klinsgpor]] foundry in Offenbach,
  as well as other typefaces for [[Ludwig and Mayer]], [[D. Stempel AG]], und [[Linotype
  Library]].\r\n\r\n[[Rudolf Koch]]\r\n(1876\u20131934) Calligrapher and teacher.
  In-house designer at the [[Klingspor]] foundry Offenbach. Designed numerous typefaces
  including [[Koch Antiqua]], [[Kabel]], and [[Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch]].\r\n\r\nThe
  shirts are available in boy cuts and girl cuts, in many different sizes and colors.
  For the moment, we are just shipping within Germany, but if anyone going to TypeCon
  wants one, let me know."
