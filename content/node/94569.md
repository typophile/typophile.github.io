    aren\u2019t talking about the lettering on the cover, right?"

  body: "Which font does the colophon say is \"Mallard\"? Exactly what does it say?
    Is it part of the cover image you posted or the book's text. If the text, could
    you please post an image of the book's text?\r\n"

  body: If u scroll down, the Colophon is on the second page of the preview. The colophon
    itself is set in the same font as the text of the book and this is the font I
    need. It's says 'typeset in mallard 11/12Pt by Colset private limited, Singapore'.
    Hope this helps!

    it looks like the text is in my default font.\r\nCould you do a screen capture?
    (I know that you can't easily grab their previews with a save image)"

  body: 'In the late 70s and early 80s, several companies were making typesetting
    machines (first optical, later digital), that worked with proprietary fonts available
    only from the device manufacturer. Compugraphic was one of the leading makers
    of such machines, and issued their own versions of then-popular typefaces with
    comically bogus names, such as Mallard for Melior, Palomino (or maybe Palladium)
    for Palatino, and Oracle for Optima (Hermann Zapf was pretty much the boss in
    the late 7os). Apparently somebody in Singapore has still got one of those old
    Compugraphic machines running. '
