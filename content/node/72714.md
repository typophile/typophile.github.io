  body: "Hi Jess,\r\n\r\nHarsh crit:\r\nPersonally, I would reevaluate the quality
    of the 'owl' illustration first. Adding the graphic element likely means you're
    not looking for a purely typographic solution, which is fine, but I think that
    element needs to be able to take visual priority and communicate, not simply get
    lost in squiggles... In my mind nothing here jives with the three descriptors
    used to define the bakery. Instead, it reminds me of some slap-dash internet anime.
    The quality and conglomeration of the rendering, pun, typeface selection and the
    objective are all at odds with one another, and no single element is worth retaining.\r\n\r\nUseful(?)
    direction:\r\nIf you're not using some kind of cultural reference already, I would
    recommend looking for examples of some script type in 1940's fashion magazines.
    The pun leads me to believe there should be some air of decadence or refinement.
    Perhaps the entire mark could be visualized as a piece of delicate ribbon?\r\n\r\nI
    won't comment on the competency of these marks, but I think these are approaching
    the ballpark you are aiming for:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thecupcakeshoppe.ca\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cupcakesonline.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.swirlscupcakes.ca\r\n\r\nLooking
