  Typographers Association to control type production? Was interesting and comical.

    \r\n\r\nthey published the \"Type Talks\" publication in 1945. I assume you may
    need to consult with real books, and not the web for more info :-(\r\n\r\nSeem
    to be later issues of \"Type Talks\" available through Amazon, these list \"Advertising
    Typographers\" as the publisher. Perhaps the ATA became the AT?"

  body: "This was a historical piece. These guys got together and tried to set some
    guidelines for good type. I get the sense they were trying to protect both American
    foundries from European competition and to help job shops that were constantly
    having to buy faces that would only be used for a job or two and then sit mouldering
    and thus not making money. I guess part of the problem was the ad agencies would
    spec some awful face for a project, the job shop would have to buy it -- all metal
    at the time - not a $60 download from myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the funny thing
    to me was how did they expect to enforce their rulings? Free economy, supply and
    demand and all that. If an agency wanted some really bad egyptian how did this
    group think they could stop that?\r\n\r\nNot earthshaking, but an interesting
    read.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"

    checked and the article is not identified as a reprint.\r\n\r\nI should point
    out the article is not advocating anything, it is just a piece on this group that
    met back in the late 1920's to try to control some aspects of type production.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"

    typesetters' organization, the Typographers International Association, issued
    a press release in 1986 challenging Apple to set their print ads on a LaserWriter.
    They were trying to protect the threat to their industry (imagine you had just
    invested tens of thousands in equipment soon to be obsolete: tragic), but they
    were also representing a quality cultural product from a trade with centuries
    of experience, against the then crappy quality of \"Desktop Publishing\"."

  body: I recall an issue of "Creative Computing" from the early 1980s that had pages
    side-by-side, one set by  phototypesetting as was the style in the day, the other
    done on a 300 DPI laser printer. And while one could still see the jaggies of
    the text, and the reduced inset page images became solid lines, the laser page
    did look quite a bit cleaner. I wish I had that issue on hand right now, but surely
    it has rotted into dust.
