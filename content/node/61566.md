body: "My Laserjet P2015 does 1200x1200 dpi. The text looks very crisp and clean.\r\n\r\nI'm
  testing a Brother HL 2170w (non-PostScript), which costs far less than my Laserjet,
  yet it boasts an \"HQ2400\" dpi of 2400x600.\r\n\r\nText printed in this 2400x600
  mode looks quite a bit thicker and darker, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing.
  Frankly, I think this 2400x600 feature is rather dubious, and I often see it on
  low-cost/budget lasers. \r\n\r\nThe odd thing is that the Brother's 600 dpi output
  looks nearly the same as my Laserjet's 1200 dpi  output, although the Laserjet's
  text looks slightly cleaner. Mind you, OS X HP drivers have never been stellar.
  \r\n\r\nWhat's this gimmicky 2400x600 dpi all about? I also noticed that a couple
  of sites seem to understand it as 600x2400."

    difference between the two?

  body: "Thanks for the reply, Simon. \r\n\r\nIt looks the same. Then again, I don't
    get a printer pane option to use landscape mode in Pages. It's only available
    through \"page setup\" in the actual application. \r\n\r\nWhen I print a .pdf,
    however, I do get the option in the printer pane. \r\n\r\nIn either case, the
    text looks the same."

  body: "In my experience, printer manufacturers employ a variety of inconsistent,
    non-standardised voodoo arithmetic to come up with essentially meaningless descriptions
    of resolution. One of my favourites is 2400dpi that turns out to be 4-colour 600dpi.\r\n\r\nThe
    only thing to do is to get test pages printed, preferably from a document you
    prepare so you can directly compare results."

  body: "Thanks for the help. \r\n\r\nI'm sticking with my HP anyway. 1200x1200 I
    can understand, plus it's a PostScript printer and it seems to render text more
    cleanly. \r\n\r\nI actually called Brother about this and the rep said their spec
    sheet (the \"real\" one, I guess), rates the printer at 1200x600. In any case,
    this is what you get for $120. "

    setup is a great feature
