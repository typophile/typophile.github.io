  body: "Thank you Stephen, and well spotted Bald Condensed. I've been working for
    a few years on a reappraisal of Rudolf Koch's Prisma, together with Alex Rich
    and Rafael Koch. We've made a new lower case (referencing old Kabel drawings --
    Prisma was caps only), digitised the upper case and turned the entire font into
    a modular set of varying weights, fills and lines: \"Prismaset\". \r\n\r\nLance
    Wyman made an obvious nod to Prisma and beautifully moved it on for Mexico '68
    and more recently Mevis & Van Deursen referenced and deconstructed Mexico for
    the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen identity in Rotterdam. We take it full circle
    back to Koch's visionary 1931 original. Hoping to deliver it to Lineto for release
    late this year."

  body: "Well done, James. And nice to see you here. Typophile is filled with lurking
    pros and thhe fact that they pipe up once in a while is what makes this place
    tick.\r\n\r\nLineto is a fine spot for Prisma. I only wish they offered their
    stuff through a couple reputable resellers."

    I <a href=\"http://timgeorgedesign.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/20-houses-a-new-residential-landscape/\">stumbled
    across it here</a> and couldn't find it for sale at Lineto or anywhere else.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It was covered in a Koren magazine magazine a few months ago, so it must not
    be far off. But of course, that's what James said (above) in 2006.
