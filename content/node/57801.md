  Graduate Studies in Typography but I am able to find very little. I was wondering
  if anyone knew of a list of Typography Programs or Typographic Educations? I live
  in Canada - any programs within Canada?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n"

  body: There is an "Advanced Typography, Communication and Ideation Design" program
    at Langara College. The director is Dr. Shelley Gruendler, a close friend of mine.
    This isn't a master's program, but Shelley went to Reading and so you can assume
    the precedent has been set.

  body: "The Universidad de Buenos Aires also has a new Master's in Type Design (Especializaci\xF3n
    en Dise\xF1o de Tipograf\xEDa). In Ale Paul's interview with MyFonts, he said
    it started in 2009, but the information I've received from the University seems
    to indicate that the program doesn't start until 2011 (tho maybe it was founded
    this year?). I'm currently living in Buenos Aires, and I'm definitely looking
    at enrolling in 2011\u2014it seems to have a stellar faculty, as well.\r\n\r\nThe
    info is in Spanish, but: [[http://www.posgradofadu.com.ar/informacion.php?f=carrera_fundamentos&tipo=2&id=207]]\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone has anymore information on this program that would be amazing! I know it's
    brand new, so the info is pretty much limited to what's on the University website
    (tho that is pretty comprehensive). Also, does anyone know if UBA charges any
    tuition for grad programs? Or what the selection process for enrollment is? Some
    info says I need to submit samples of my work, whereas other info says it has
    totally open enrollment."
