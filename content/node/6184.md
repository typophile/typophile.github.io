    <BR>Perhaps you could give more background on the type  <BR>of company, etc. '

  body: I agree,  <BR> <BR>to make the word rock fall down it has a negative connotation,
    the same as the tool you are using&#40;don&#39;t know the name in english&#41;,
    is too agressive. <BR> <BR>CG

  body: To me before I &#42;read&#42; the logo it felt like a rock climbing logo.
    I think it was the color, the tool and feeling of gravity that it is expressing.
    There is a certain amount of adrenalin in this logo for me, something I usually
    don

  body: Ok. My apologies for the lack of background. Bedrock Landscapes does high
    end custom rock work for cottages and homes. Decks, stairways, patios, beaches...etc.  They
    actually work with rock - meaning they carve, crack and shape the rocks into form.
    The client wanted to communicate the artistry and hand made approach that they
    take in their work. Hence the pick axe and breaking rock. They only work with
    rock which involves a lot of heavy lifting - which is why I went with the &#34;aggressive
    heavy&#34; feel.  Most landscaping companies are associated with grass, flowers
    and gardens. They don&#39;t do this kind of work. The want to be identified as
    people who work with rock.

  body: I like it.  The aggressive edge works for me, assuming it&#39;s what the company
    wants to say about itself.  I like the colours too.  It&#39;ll look nice on the
    side of a white van. <BR> <BR>If you want to tinker and keep the text &#34;straight&#34;,
    you could take the pick-axe and cross it with a shovel in an X shape, like two
    swords or halberds would be crossed on a heraldric seal.  I think the tool has
    a strong shape, and it would be a shame to lose it. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: Cool. It makes more sense to me now.   <BR>  <BR>I don&#39;t know if I was
    clear before, but I like the color.  <BR>  <BR>I really like the card. <BR> <BR>What
    if you were to line &#42;landscapes&#42; up on the left to increase the feeling
    of gravity? It might not work for the card. <BR> <BR>

  body: ok I say flip the pick, jab it into the same space but rock angles upwards
    13 degrees on the end. When you break something on a hard surface &#40;ground&#41;
    the material would anchor itself upwards anyway...not down unless it was on an
    edge and going to fall off. et voila negative connotation gone, same graphics
    and concept, but perhaps better balance...pick graphic tucked into white space
    where &#34;Rock&#34; is angled. <BR>

  body: Similarly, I think the negative connotation could be somewhat eliminated by
    rotating the word &#39;bedrock&#39; and the pick axe to the left a few degrees
    so that &#39;bed&#39; is falling down and rock is horizontal. I should like to
    see it that way, though perhaps it wouldn&#39;t help anything.

    <BR> <BR>I agree with many of the comments here. It&#39;s a great logo &#40;why
    can&#39;t I find clients with names like that!&#41; but the angles aren&#39;t
    quite working for me. <BR> <BR>What if you did something like this: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6254.gif"
