    that someone will decrypt it as this process is coming since long. \r\nYou know
    that  making fonts Is a difficult process, if one person is ready to make it despite
    all difficulties and struggles, other person is ready to dismiss his all struggles.\r\nIn
    spite this, I want to encrypt me fonts.\r\nThere is a proverb in our language,
    that you have to protect yourself from gentlemen, not from thief.\r\nAnyway, what
    do you know about font encryption?    \r\n"
