    say give it a try, it's only $29 and an hour. If it breaks FL let us know. "

    Snow Leopard on my laptop and FL 5.0.4 works fine after Rosetta was installed,

  body: Initial thoughts are that FLab 4.6 does appear to work ok in Snow Leopard,
    however, it does lose the license registration details so make sure you have your
    license key handy.

    more stable now.

    thread on the FontLab forum</a>, people are seeing random crashes, sometimes taking
    down the whole system, when running FontLab Studio on 10.6. A crash taking down
    the entire system is not something I''ve seen for a while, and prefer not to see
    again any time soon. Anybody else experiencing this sort of thing after upgrading? '

  body: "Looks like the official word from FontLab is to hold off upgrading to 10.6
    for now. In an email sent today to FontLab users from Ted Harrison:\r\n\r\n\"Since
    our first tests showed FontLab Studio working fine on OS 10.6 we thought we were
    home free. But many reports are now coming in of unpredictable system crashes
    while using Snow Leopard and FLS5. And we aren't the only one. Photoshop Elements,
    Google Gears, Adobe CS2, CS4, RealVNC and Parallels 3.0 (and many others) reportedly
    either flat out don't work, or just don't work right. Apple has posted a support
    page that includes a partial list of software known not to work with Snow Leopard:
    http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3258 \r\n\r\n\"Our recommendation is to stick with
    OS 10.5 until Apple comes out with updates.\r\nThanks for your patience.\"\r\n\r\nI
    would be curious to know if the update that was issued this afternoon (10.6.1)
    has any effect on this situation.\r\n\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3810"

    on 10.6.1 for a few days now and have not had a single crash!

  body: My experience is that FontLab is crashing much less under 10.6.1. Only one
    crash in four days of working. The problem I find is the speed of the application
    with multiple fonts open. I was finishing a 24 font family and the "Generate All"
    and the "Save All" commands took forever to execute. I'm talking minutes. Single
    fonts do not seem to be a problem.

    if some of the problems are due to "system crud".
