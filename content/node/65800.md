    travel costs, I should probably focus on Europe.)"

  body: "Awesome. If you can pull it off that's just a super idea.\r\nReminds me of
    a former manager of mine, who is on the road with his partner for a year I think,
    doing design events: http://www.ideanomads.com/\r\n(Although I can't help but
    wonder if actually <em>working</em> in different countries, like you intend to
    do, wouldn't be even more of a learning experience.)\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't really
    see how non-Europe is necessarily more expensive. For one thing, airfare isn't
    really proportional to distance."

    it off, and everything works out. (But I still got some more time for planning
    and finding 'hosts'.)\r\nI know, Europe shouldn't be the 'border' for this.\r\n\r\nThanks,
    Nina and Hrant."
