  with contextual alternates which mimic patterns of wear or breaking of the lead?"

  body: I don't know of one, but it sounds like a great idea. There are certainly
    wood type inspired faces with alternates for various wooden sorts; I would love
    to see the same for a lead face.

  body: "In the small letterpress house I worked in in my youth we had rarely-used
    faces\u2014ones that the gaffer considered not worth replacing\u2014in which some
    characters required two pieces of gummed paper to make them ready. Reproducing
    this digitally would be nostalgia gone mad I think."
