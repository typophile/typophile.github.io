body: "On the main forum page, the 'critique' forum mentions that it's a place to
  critique typefaces. It'd be nice if that description was a bit detailed and included
  the fact that logos and layouts are also critiqued in there.\r\n\r\nOnce in there,
  it'd be nice to have a reminder for folks how to best label their thread. Here's
  a quick sample of many of the current logo thread titles:\r\n\r\n - Logo Design
  Advice/Critique Please\r\n - Need advice on word mark\r\n - Advice for logo\r\n
  - Personal Logo... and Type\r\n - need opinion please\r\n - Help\r\n - Personal
  Logo\r\n - Need Feedback on \"logo\"\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to remind people to use
  a descriptive title so we can follow the individual discussions a bit better."

  body: "Thank you for that post. \r\n\r\nI was actually just thinking about that
    issue when I titled my post \"Logo Design Advice/Critique Please.\" My two concerns
    were:\r\n\r\n1. Judging by the way other posts are named, perhaps it is not good
    to put the name of the company in the label. In retrospect, that does not really
    make much sense.\r\n\r\n2. At times it can be difficult to keep a label concise
    and still desccriptive. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand. This very issue created a problem
    for me recently because I read a posting one day and then I could not find it
    again a few days later.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for bring up this concern. I for
    one will make sure to label my future posts more carefully.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "Thanks for this post Darrel. One of my roles is technically to moderate the
    Critique forum and make sure that exactly this level of clarity that you're looking
    for is there. I've been quite lax in this over the last months. Sorry for the
    confusion :(\r\n\r\nDuncan brings up a good point,too. I think that typefaces
    are easier to label that logos. Even print or web projects are easier to describe
    with limited words. Isn't everyone who uploads a logo basically asking, \"hey
    guys, how could I make this logo for Company X better?\"\r\n\r\nBack in the day,
    the typeface sections were more populated that the logos and other design sections.
    I think that it is sort of a pity that this is not the case anymore. But all traffic
    and critique is good, even if it isn't specially type design related."

  body: "Perhaps we need to move all the critique stuff up one level and cut the subcategories.
    \ This would allow the showing of recent posts in the \"Forums\" window. Cut the
    categories down to three 1. Typeface critique, 2. Logo critique, 3. Type layout
    critique. This would put sans, serif, display, etc., in the same forum.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I should have clarified. It's not the that title has to be overly descriptive...just
    that they have to be unique enough to tell one thread apart from the other when
    trying to keep up on the ones that were of interest to a reader.\r\n\r\nAs such,
    I'd suggest folks do put the name of the product/company they are creating the
    logo for in the title.\r\n\r\nI'd also agree with Chris...the critiques are a
    bit buried which is a bit cumbersome and is also inconsistent with the rest of
    the forum areas. In addition, I would agree that the various types of type critiques
    don't necessarily need to be subdivided like that."
