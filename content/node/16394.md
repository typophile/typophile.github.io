    you have ClearType (or one of its clones) activated the best you can do with bi-level
    rendering is have one or two pixel stems which means a maximum of two weights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 7, is that seven? Even if you have CT, I doubt it'll help. 8 a little. 9 a
    little more. Stylistic diversity at those sizes is not a problem because it's
    not really possible. Have you ever done this before? :)

  body: "First some groundwork: to me the best way to\r\nmeasure the size of a bitmap
    font is to go from\r\nthe top of the lc ascenders to the bottom of the\r\ndescenders.
    Any other measure is less useful\r\nin the end.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nGuys, it's not
    so bad. Certainly no need to resort to unicase.\r\nAnd you don't need ClearType
    either. In fact at those sizes\r\nCT's deficiencies (specifically color fringing,
    inconsistent\r\nglyphs) get amplified.\r\n\r\nTopologically, you need five pixels
    for the x-height.\r\nAt 9, you have no real problems. At 8, the descenders\r\nget
    tricky. At 7, you're left with only two pixels for\r\nboth ascenders and descenders,
    which makes shapes like\r\nthe \"f\" and \"g\" (in either form) impossible. HOWEVER:\r\n\r\n1)
    Just like the masters of phone book font design\r\nhave always done, you don't
    necessarily have to respect\r\nthe baseline and x-line all of the time: for example
    the\r\nbar of the \"f\" could be lowered, and the head of the \"g\"\r\ncould sit
    higher than the baseline.\r\n\r\n2) You can actually use 4 pixels for the x-height,\r\nalthough
    easy decipherment suffers a good deal.\r\n\r\nMy Mana family (a grayscale pixelfont,
    what I consider\r\nas having the highest aesthetic* and functional potential)\r\ncomes
    in 16, 13 and 11 PPEM sizes. I have a 9 planned.\r\nIt wouldn't be very hard to
    do an 8 (and even a 7) but\r\nI won't; but only because at those sizes it's no
    longer\r\nMana, and becomes too close to free stuff that looks\r\nalmost the same.\r\n\r\n*
    Yes, including stylistic differences.\r\n\r\nIf/when I make pixelfonts smaller
    than 9, they will\r\nhave to have something quite different about them.\r\n(Even
    more different than using gray pixels.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "You vary weights sort of in the same way that \"blind\" automatic-from-outlines
    algorithms do, just with a lot more control (stability): you use shades of gray.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of the black bodies, the threshold for going from one- to two-pixel stems
    varies according to: PPEM size; x-height; and width. For a design of conventional
    Cartesian proportions, the threshold is about 14-15 PPEM.* Once the black body
    thickness threshold is established, you can use a dark gray at just above the
    threshold to get a demi weight for example. This, I've done myself, and it produces
    quite nice dark-weight emphasis (much nicer than a full-bold and even an italic).
    On the other hand I admit I haven't tried Light weights that way. But it's nothing
    a commission can't fix.  :-)\r\n\r\n* It's mainly with focus-group-induced mayhem
    that the original MS core fonts started violating this and rendering out too-light
    one-pixel bitmaps at \"normal\" reading sizes. And Apple followed suit of course.
    Before the MS core fonts, Apple's 16 PPEM sizes had nice 2-pixel stems.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing that helps btw is making the forms wider the smaller the point size. Although
    this can skew the overall character of the family, it: leaves more room for small[er]
    variations; and correlates nicely with optical scaling needs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
