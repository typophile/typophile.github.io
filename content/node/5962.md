body: Not your typical concept but the client loves the evil feel surrounding the
  name. The skull thing has been done so many times I&#39;m finding it a bit worn.  <BR>Anyway
  any help - constructive thoughts are much appreciated.  <BR>Concept is for a custom
  bike company which wants to convey the freedom of biking while incorporating a skull.
  They manufacture custom bikes - you pick the parts - they assemble it. It has to
  fit within that &#34;psycho&#34; biking market, cool, hip etc. Some constraints
  - a crest logo for the front &#40;about 1.5&#34; wide&#41; so it can&#39;t go horizontal.
  A wordmark only, no logo, will follow for the side frame &#40;horizontal only&#41;.
  The concepts here are development stages from top to most recent. Fonts are not
  even a thought yet. So here it is skull w/riding mask, bike gear and pure evil!
  Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42260.jpg"

  body: Mark, I&#39;m a bicycle racer, what kind of bikes are they customising? There
    is a huge difference in the mentality between the types of riders. Road vs Mountain
    vs City vs BMX could you clarify the marketing as it won&#39;t work across all
    these kinds of groups.

  body: i think your &#34;Ghost Rider&#34;, its good for downhill or freeride. <BR>but
    for road, or cyclocross, i dont know. <BR> <BR>maybe can be good for bmx, freestyle,
    and trial riders, but will need more ornaments. ornaments of a bad boy.

  body: I am a friend of Mark&#39;s, he is out for the night, but just so the critique
    can continue I can clearify that it is for downhill/freeride and hardcore cross
    country type stuff. Full suspension required.  <BR> <BR>The bikes that are being
    put together are the same type and feature alot of hard to find parts, and really
    high end stuff. I think the owner plans to start a team as well, so the logo would
    be applied to that as well. <BR> <BR>I know one of the problems he is encountering
    is if it should be like some type or emblem or crest, like at the front of the
    car.

  body: 'Juan, if you and your brother are road racers come visit NYC we have a huge
    cycling scene here. CRCA is the oldest and largest club in the country. Our best
    riders in the area are Dominicans.  <BR> <BR>I degress, as for the logo it works
    for the off road crowd, but you also need to develope a down tube look, a hard
    horizontal.  <BR> <BR>Time for me to go ride around Manhattan '

  body: I used to love Ghost Rider, I guess my question is I feel I havn&#39;t gone
    far enough, is the simplicity of the bottom concept good or do downhill/freeryde/crosscountry
    target audience require some more details. I&#39;m still throwing around the idea
    of making it a crest, like a biker club logo with more elements. Comments??

  body: Mark <BR> <BR>i think your logo has a weight problem, maybe if you bold it
    a little bit it can look less fragile, right now i like it but it feels like with
    the first fall will be smashed down. <BR> <BR>CG
