  a second edition of the book I used last year as a reference (A Typographic Workbook:
  A primer to history, techniques and artistry). In this second edition (and not in
  the first), there is a section devoted to the art of Copy fitting as well as related
  exercises. How important and/or relevant do you think it is to teach budding graphic
  designers this procedure? Realistically, I don't think anyone uses this anymore
  - and it might be of interest to talk about but is it worth actually teaching?\r\n\r\nYour
  views?"

  body: "Andi,\r\nthat's an interesting question that I asked myself last year while
    teaching typography to a second year graphic design class.\r\n\r\nThey had already
    started the basics with Quark during their previous year so \"copy fitting\" came
    as no real mystery to them. The school was using James Craig's <em>Designing with
    Type</em> and when we reached the section on traditional copyfitting (manually
    calculating) I did talk them through the excercise quickly, just for the mechanics
    of it, but then added an in-class project for them to solve.\r\n\r\nI gave them
    a \"real case\" scenario of working production at a small weekly news magazine.
    The style sheet is fixed: display and subhead styles & sizes, body text and caption
    typefaces, point size & line spacing, and column widths. They were also given
    4 photos and a sidebar to work into a 2 page spread. All the Quark layouts were
    done WITHOUT text insertion, just the text columns blocked out ready for copy.
    \r\n\r\nKnowing that news articles come in last minute and are often re-edited,
    my question to them was: <em>What is the character (or line) count number to be
    given to the writer/editor so that it could all fit at the last minute</em>.\r\n\r\nThe
    answer (and solutions) can be arrived at very easily in several ways, but the
    principle is that text fitting SHOULD NOT be done on-the-fly, fudged, nudged or
    mutilated, but can be estimated beforehand.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to be given
    a large manuscript file to start with, and to be asked \"<em>How many pages long
    will this book, manual, catalog or whatever, going to be?</em>\" And many times,
    the graphic designer is just doing production and cannot make arbitrary changes
    to layout and content. Somebody has to tell them <em>it ain't gonna fit</em> before
    spending hours and then discovering that it won't.\r\n\r\nNo, I personally don't
    feel traditional copyfitting techniques need be taught, but I do believe that
    graphic designers should treat text the way architects and construction companies
    treat bricks. Not just an element to build with, but a tangible entity that gives
    character to the building itself. Again, someone has to calculate how many and
    what specific kind of bricks will be needed before starting the project.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I copyfit with style!"

    DesigningWithType.com, to complement his book. His team lists samples of many
    <a href=\"http://www.designingwithtype.com/projects.html\" target=\"new\"><strong>projects</strong></a>
    done by design students around the world, including the Ontario College of Art
    and Design.\r\n"

  body: I've been on the site, Norbert, and through all of the sample exercises. There
    are some really good ones there adn I've downloaded a few. I've written to Mr.
    Craig as well, very nice man. So far, for the first year students, I have found
    the workbook I am using the most helpful. I use it mostly as reference but it's
    very comprehensive. The trouble is that there is just so much typographic material
    to cover in such a short period of time under the roof of one big Graphic Design
    program. I really have to be very selective with what I feed young minds. I want
    it all to be relevant and interesting (even though I find all the information
    I teach very interesting myself!)

    He sat with us at the party at TypeCon.  Too bad you missed meeting him while
    you were there--he is a very nice man.\r\n\r\nYears ago, when I was teaching,
    copyfitting was very important and I had made up an exercise for my students.
    \ I will Check Jack Benny's vault for it if you like but I think Norbert has a
    good way of making it current and useful.  Today, copyfitting after the text is
    written is mostly pointless.  Allowing an exact amount of space, as Norbert points
    out, to be filled later is still a current need.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"

  body: "> <em>so much typographic material to cover in such a short period of time
    ...</em>\r\n\r\nSo true. Oddly enough, typography is delegated a minor position
    in most Graphic Design programs. Perhaps in another topic thread the forum can
    explore suggestions for <em>new</em> excercises/projects to aid students in developing
    sensitivity to typography.\r\n"

    an excellent idea Norbert. I remember there was a section devoted to educators
    in the pre beta version of Typophile but it wasn't heavily populated. Mind you,
    I get scores of ideas from all the typographers here but an education area would
    be fantastic!"

  body: "I also met James Craig many years ago. He started teaching typography at
    The Cooper Union years after I left.\r\n\r\nLast year while I was using his book
    for typography class, I had a  genuine interest in contacting him and suggest
    a possible collaboration on new excercises/projects that could be added to the
    web site. But I am ashamed to say that I never acted on it.\r\n\r\nI did talk
    with Alan Halley about what Agfa-Monotype (now Monotype Imaging) had available
    for educational resources and he did give me links to the type info/education
    areas they were developing online.\r\n\r\nI am less interested in developing any
    guidlines for selecting and using type since those kinds of resources abound.
    I have been more interested in exploring new methods/exercises that would help
    interested students to develop that <em>special sensitivity and feeling</em> for
    typography.\r\n\r\nI use the term <em>excerise</em> because that is exactly what
    they would be. Not a project or anything finished, but a series of \"warm-ups\"
    that aid understanding. \r\n\r\nLike traditional Chinese <em>Kung Fu</em>, the
    master would run students through a series of seemingly useless routines, all
    of which actually help to develop new abilities. Remember, \"<em>Wax on. Wax off</em>.\"?\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

    pre-computer. It is useless now, except as mentioned above to tell a writer what
    character count will fit. That takes 1 minute:\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, use the Placeholder
    Text feature to flow in Lorum Ipsum text into the ad, mag page, web page, etc.
    Then copy and paste that into Word (shudder!) and do a character count. Easy greasy.
    All that old chacter counting stuff and math is completely obsolete. Any book
    that seriously suggests you teach it is obsolete too. \r\n\r\nAs for books, I
    find Lupton's Thinking with Type to be just the right fit for an intro class.
    Cutting edge examples, copulating dinosaurs (seriously!) and enough typographic
    history, theory, and technique discussed quite intelligently. Some good projects
    available online too at thinkingwithtype.com. I love it. Structure my quizzes,
    exercises, and projects around it. \r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nH. Todd Duren,
