body: "I was wondering if somebody had informations about book types being made in
  switzerland (german or french part).\r\nEverybody knows about helvetica, frutiger
  and so on, but before that (16, 17, 18, 19th century) there should have been some
  punchcutters and type founders or were all types only copies or buyed in france
  and germany?\r\nFrom what i know, basel was a center for printing since it was a
  religious center but i'm more interested in roman types...\r\n\r\nI'm studying graphic
  design here in switzerland but all my ressources are french or english books and
  i can't find lots of information.\r\nThanks to anybody who could give me some interesting
  ways for my researches!\r\n\r\nX-Y"
