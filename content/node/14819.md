body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Notan </strong>\r\n\r\nNotan is about
  the relationship of light and dark shapes. That relationship is not always one of
  balance, although the balance of light and dark obviously has resonance in Asian
  philosophy, expressed in the balanced opposition of yin and yang in Taoism for instance.
  The relationship is often one of tension, in which there is a deliberate imbalance,
  or in which the formal dominance of the light or dark is countered with the spacial
  dominance of the other, e.g a strong black shape in a large white field. It is also
  important to observe that in Japanese aesthetics notan is not limited to black and
  white, but is expressed in terms of light and dark. In the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumi-e\">sumi-e</a>
  style of painting, for instance, there may be no pure black or white at all, only
  shades of grey composed in areas of light and dark. In this context the notion of
  \u2018good notan\u2019 is obviously much more complex than mere balance.\r\n\r\nThe
  original Chinese characters, pronounced \u2018n\xF3ng d\xE0n\u2019 in Chinese or
  \u2018no-tan\u2019 in Japanese refer to how dense the ink is you use in an ink watercolor
  painting. The solid ink is mixed with water, and can mixed either more dense and
  dark (n\xF3ng) or more dilute and light (d\xE0n). How a painter handles \u2018notan\u2019
  in an ink painting refers in the first place to how they handle the more and less
  dilute ink\u2014the shades of grey\u2014in the strokes themselves. But by extension
  the white is included in consideration of \u2018notan\u2019, and not just the strokes,
  as it is the most light or \u2018dilute\u2019 part of the painting. (A clear as
  opposed to dark sky is also described as \u2018d\xE0n\u2019. It also refers to thin
  or weak soup or tea.)\r\n\r\nThe meaning and relevance of notan to type design is
  under increasing discussion, but many outstanding type designers, including Frutiger,
  have emphasized the importance of \"designing the whites.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the people
  who have written about Notan as it relates to Type design on Typophile include :
  Hrant Papazian, William Berkson and  Eben Sorkin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
