body: "I been using modular scales in my layouts and typesetting recently and have
  built a calculator to help produce double stranded scales. \r\n\r\nI have also added
  in the calculations for ems and base 16 ems as I often need them when building websites.\r\n\r\nFigures
  can be entered as straight numerals or in picas and points, as in 10p6 for 10 picas
  and 6 points.\r\n\r\nAnyway I thought I'd share it here incase someone else may
  find it useful.\r\n\r\n[[http://modular-scale.com]]\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate
  any feedback or suggestions."
