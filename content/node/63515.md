  E&A Magazine.  Designed by Studio von Birken: http://www.studiovonbirken.com/.  (For
  the curious, the giant ampersand is from Stilla: http://www.linotype.com/90269/stilla-family.html).
  \ Many thanks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/svb-5-058181-C_4108.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/svb-5-058189_6404.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/svb-5-058190_6144.jpg]"
