  for movies that have text in scenes with particular attention to typography styles.\r\nAs
  an example i'm thinking about something like Stranger then Fiction or Wes Anderson
  movies.\r\nDo you have any suggestions ?\r\nThanks"

    Spielberg's movie \"Artificial Intelligence\" in which a poem in an distinctive
    font was important to the plot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_3733.i..jpg]\r\n\r\nA
    video clip (with captions for some reason) which shows the same poem at a different

    <em>and</em> the wild\"; \"faery\" is misspelled; the last two lines should be
    one; and the first line ends in an exclamation point. (William Butler Yeats, \"The
    Stolen Child\")\r\n\r\n2. The font is Mona Lisa."

  body: "My guess is they wanted a contemporary spelling for \"fairy\", and the line
    break was changed to make lines similar lengths, but no idea why \"and\" was changed
    to \"of\".  \r\n\r\nThis was originally a Stanley Kubrick project, but after Kubrick
    died it was taken over by Spielberg (Kubrick had previously talked about letting
    Spielberg direct it). Perhaps \"of\" was a typo in the script and Spielberg didn't
    want to correct it in case it a deliberate change by Kubrick.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the font ID; I wondered what it was."

  body: "I wonder if Stanley Kubrick chose Mona Lisa? The digital font was released
    in 1991. He died in 1999. The hard edges and formal structure of this Art Deco
    serif design -- tall, thin and very regular -- suggest a futuristic cold spirituality
    rather than joy or human warmth. A good fit for this rather depressing movie.\r\nDon"

    after watching 2011's "The Artist" but all I ever found were notes about how historically
    inacurate the Artist's type choices were. What exaclty is your research gonna
    be about Victoria?

    movie to show the cutting edge of technology. Today it is beginning to look increasingly
    quaint. Same for OCR shaped fonts -- so 70s. For a movie maker who wants a film
    to continue to communicate with people for many years into the future tried and
    tested works well. Consider Windsor in Woody Allen's movies, or Bernhard Modern
    in Downton Abby. Might be something of interest in http://fontmeme.com/movie-fonts/\r\nApologies
    Victoria,  for having strayed from fonts in scenes to fonts in titling, but the
    thread was already drifting in that direction :( Perhaps a typophile is prepared
    to put us back on track.\r\nDon"

    a reference librarian to help you research the topic. They maybe be able to help
    you find books or magazine articles on the topic. \r\n\r\nFor example, there are
    some movie magazines (not fan magazines) that discuss technical aspects of filmmaking
    and possibly a back issue touches on this topic. Also maybe some graphic design
    magazines (Graphis, etc) discuss it in a back issue."
