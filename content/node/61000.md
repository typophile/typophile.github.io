  body: "I am sure they are based on fonts, and I do not know how old this packaging
    is but Charlie Hughes drew/redrew many/almost all of the cereal box \"logos.\"
    Some are obviously drawn, some amended fonts... if that helps.\r\n\r\nI am sure
    somebody will give you the core identity.\r\n\r\nMichael"
