  body: "I feel like writing a long post. :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I'm only a beginner
    so please take my comments with a large grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThis looks interesting,
    even though it's positioning itself in a rather densely populated genre. For instance,
    a few glyphs (especially the \"e\") instantly reminded me of Etelka. It might
    be quite fruitful to do some research in this genre (if you haven't done so already).\r\n\r\nTo
    give deeper / more meaningful feed-back, it would be good to know what purpose
    you have in mind for this \u2013 is it intended for display, or text sizes?\r\n\r\nMy
    main impression \u2013 especially if this is not only meant for large sizes \u2013
    is that it's very \"graphic design-y\", which mostly means there are a lot of
    identical shapes. I wonder if that is intended; and even if it is, I doubt it'd
    work at least in smaller sizes. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, the \"b\", \"d\", \"p\",
    and \"q\" look like they might all be the same shape, mirrored / rotated; I tend
    to think the \"b\" and \"p\" are working better \u2013 the \"d\" and \"q\" look
    \"flipped\" to me. Similarly, the \"u\" seems to be a rotated \"n\" \u2013 and
    looks slightly too wide as a consequence. \r\n\r\nWhat you have here is an interesting
    idea, but I believe it could grow to be much more if you are ready to dive deeper
    into the intricacies of type design, where it departs from the simpler/straighter
    (IMHO) premises of graphic design.\r\n\r\nSome detail impressions:\r\n\r\nI'd
    try a monocameral \"g\". This one seems out of character (and even if one accepts
    the basic premise for a second, I'm not sure the tail works).\r\n\r\n\"k\": It
    does look nice, but may be out of character in this font. Have you tried a double
    join? Or maybe one with a crossbar?\r\n\r\nAt least if this is going to be a text
    face, the joins on the \"n\" and \"m\" may be too high.\r\n\r\nThe \"o\" is way
    too round. \r\n\r\nThe \"s\" looks pretty nice \u2013 congrats. Though it may
    have a hair too much weight in the tight curves, especially the bottom-right.
    I believe the usual way to do it is to put the most weight on the spine.\r\n\r\nThere's
    something slightly off-putting about the \"x\"; then again, I haven't figured
    the \"x\" out myself so I can't really say why. Perhaps it's too narrow?\r\n\r\nI
    like the \"y\" a lot, especially the join.\r\n\r\nIs the diagonal of the \"z\"
    a bit too heavy?\r\n\r\nKeep us posted. :-)"

  body: "Hi,\r\nI agree with some of Nina's observations, thought the pbdq thing was
    unexpected. \r\nI agree there's a whole lot of other fonts in the square sans
    genre these days so if you want to market this you'll need to be definite about
    making it different.\r\nMy initial feelings were about the g,u and m. The g needs
    reconsidering. The bowl is too round and the tail is a bit flat. u needs a higher
    join, and the mnr could be lower as Nina said. m looks too wide to me. \r\na and
    c don't quite harmonise because c is curved on top and a looks straight. \r\nI
    think the traps on vwy should carry over to z. The round shapes could do with
    more overshoot.\r\nAgain, I'm not very advanced in fontmaking so feel free to
    add more salt... :)"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g-unnamed_6635.gif]\r\n\r\nI think I
    would give the g tail a more natural curve than the filleted round that is on
    there now. Nothing against the the fillet, it just doesn't show up any where else
    in the design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Eric MacLeod\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That does look a bit more natural. But do you think the shape only needs
    that curve tweak? I'm not sure this \"g\" has anything much to do with the rest
    of the font, and that tail still looks rather strained, and struggling for width.
    \r\nPlease do enlighten me if I'm wrong."

  body: "For the \"g\", the top of the bottom bowl can be moved up to arrive at a
    better balance of proportions. But there are issues of polish as well, like the
    inside of the top bowl is not very circular - it's more like a fat diamond, and
    the curve widths seem inconstant. The \"diamond\" problem is repeated in the \"o\",
    and other glyphs have similar problems. Also in the \"g\": the ear is too long.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi there, first i would like to say thanks to the responses that we had.\r\nTo
    explain the initial idea for this font, this is not for a paid client, it has
    born from the major interest that 3 persons from the studio, have in typography,
    and would like to improve their knowledges and after some hard study and investigation,
    we started to do a font that somehow represented a bit of each of us, we have
    take some nordic inspiration, and without doubt FF Signa was a major one(of course
    without the intend of beeing a clone), FF Max, Etelka from StormTypeFoundry, and
    some portuguese from Dstype.\r\nOur major intent is to be a text font, readable
    and modern with some \"cool\" feeling behind it.\r\n\r\nAnswering to Altaira and
    Bendy (thank you :) ), the mirrored \"p,b,q,d\" it really needs more atention
    and perhaps with would work better with a little diferences between them.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"g\" was the last letter to be drawn, and it was a headache, first he've tried
    what seems logical to us a shape that was a \"q\" with a tail, but somehow with
    seemed that it didn't work, so we've tried to do it in this way, any suggestions??!!!!,
    should we persue the this\"g\" or the other one???\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"o\"
    we really like the \"openness\" of it, but we will try to balance it with the
    rest.\r\n\r\nThanks to all and keep on touch, we will be on workin.\r\n\r\nOur
    best regards\r\n\r\nPrpa"

  body: "On the 'o' and 'g'; the 'o' needs to be more square, basically like the 'c'
    but closed off, so to speak. The same goes to the top of the 'g', it is too circular,
    it needs to be more angular to fit with the rest of the characters.\r\nI also
    think the same could be said for the 's'. While it is a rather nice 's' on itself,
    I don't think it fits particularly well with the overall design. Just like the
    'o' and 'g', it is too smooth. Take a look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo/|Camingo]],
    or some of the other examples that have been mentioned, to see how these issues
    were solved.\r\n\r\nThe right stroke of the 'y' seems to be too heavy. You have
    to turn this around, the left stroke should be the heavier one.\r\n\r\nThe ear
    of the 'r' starts way to low in my opinion. This one seems to be made with a sliced
    off 'n', but really you should see it as a completely seperate shape. Take [[http://www.typeworkshop.com/type-basics/typebasics-17.jpg|this
    image]] as an example (exerpt from Underware's Type Basics). The ear of the 'r'
    works best if it starts somewhere in the range 1/2 or 3/4 of the stem (so 2/3's
    could also work, etc.)."

  body: "@altaira \r\n\r\nI think a curved 3-story g would be useful to keep the spline
    in s from being isolated. \r\n\r\nI second the polish issues mentioned by hrant/Quincunx,
    in carrying out the squarish \"cool\" look present in b,d,p,q,h,n,u,c,e into g,o\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    your o is'nt open, it's even a bit close compare to the p which one is open. Other
    thing is the horizontal bar in the m, n, u, I would reduce the thickness a little
    to avoid to get something too black between the stem and the join."
