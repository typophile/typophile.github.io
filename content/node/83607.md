body: "My name is Ian Roberts, in August I will be headed to Frankfurt/Offenbach and
  then to Berlin. I will be studying type and meeting with different type designers.
  From the inspiration I acquire I will be creating 10 opentype typefaces along with
  some collateral posters and work. I am fundraising money to offset the cost of the
  trip and to be able to make more fonts & content inspired from my trip. Would you
  be interested in backing my project/spreading the word by writing a blog post or
  article about my project? you can check out my fundraising page here http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ianroberts/designing-10-progressive-typefaces-that-rock-your\r\n"
