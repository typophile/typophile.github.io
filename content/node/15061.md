    a Runic character, but it doesn't much resemble your example."

    case, I'm referring here to the OE ligature.

  body: "Oh yes, I think I might have recently seen it in some IN book [too].\r\nPaul,
    let me know if you'd like me to track it down.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm curious: What's
    wrong with three vowels (visually)? Also, the \"OE\" there is linked due to grammatical
    rules - it's like a distinct letter, so it's not like it's an option (although
    Baskerville for one has set them -or actually an \"AE\"- as two characters, just
    using tighter spacing to \"link\" them).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    an Aegean island in <em>The Odyssey</em> call Aeaea, sometimes spelled Aiaia.
    How's that for vowels?"
