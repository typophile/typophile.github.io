body: "If you are reading this you may as well be aware of me as a designer. <em>(Maybe
  also by one of my former aliases \u2014 Forma/formlos/...)</em> And as such I am
  currently looking for a new job/(paid)internship/placement. Wherever this may be
  \u2014 I am considering relocating. I previously focused quite heavily on brand
  development, corporate design and typography. Hmm, what else. I've been working
  in design for 10 years now, in Europe <em>(Austria, the UK, Italy)</em>. My past
  work has been featured in various design related publications. <em>(And \u2014 You
  may have seen <a href=\"http://for.ma/blog/?p=292\" target=\"_blank\">my 'Typophile
  T'</a> up there. ;)</em>\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions concerning me or my past
  and future work, let me know \u2014 <em>mail(at)davidhubner.com</em>. Thank you,

    both rise to the top when we hire designers.
