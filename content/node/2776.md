    I was just pulling yer leg Grant! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve noticed that when your search entry is more than  <BR>one
    word it doesn&#39;t find the combination, so that&#39;s  <BR>possibly it. I&#39;ve
    had it numerous times that when I  <BR>try to narrow down my search query it doesn&#39;t
    find  <BR>anything, whereas if I use only one keyword it finds  <BR>what I need,
    but then I have to plough through all the  <BR>extra results to nail the stuff
    I&#39;m looking for.
