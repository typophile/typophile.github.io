body: "I was wondering if you could please help me identify the fonts on this car
  club plaque. I\u2019ve gone through some of the biggest font databases I can find,
  and I cannot find this font anywhere. I really need your help and expertise on this
  subject.\r\n\r\nWhat I need to know is, the exact name of the font, and what family
  of font does it derived from, and the name of the company where I can buy this from.
  The fonts in particular I\u2019m trying to identify are \u201Cold memories\u201D.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  included a JPG photo of the plaque for you to look at. I really hope you can help
  me out here, because I keep running into dead ends, and run out of places to look.\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nMichael G.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldMemoriesCarClub_4651.jpg]"

  body: "It's not really one particular font. It's more of a style known as Fraktur,
    Textura Quadrata and some features look like Old English. There are a lot of variations
    in this style. So if you're looking for an exact typeface like this you won't
    find it. Most logo's around are modifications of existing typefaces.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need more help let me know.\r\n\r\ngood luck, \r\nSidney"
