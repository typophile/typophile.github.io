  body: You got it. I posted without seeing your ID. And I think it may well be Bold,
    not Heavy.

    and it's actually sun extra bold that they use on there so i guess that's it.\r\n\r\nAnd
    they do sell it on the fontshop store so I mustve seen it there :)"

    used to have quite a few <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/foundry/fontfont/">FontFonts</a>,
    so maybe that's why it looks FontFontesque (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=fontesque&x=12&y=13">Fontesque</a>
    ;^).
