    you want to go to find \"Southern Style?\" These days, there are more transplants
    (or transplant offspring) than natives, & they've brought their \"style\" with
    them. We tried -- Cary, North Carolina, just outside Raleigh (\"Cary\" is also
    thought of as a Containment Area for Relocated Yankees) couldn't hold 'em all.\r\n\r\nSeriously.
    talking about \"southern typographic style\" in 2010 runs a serious risk of being
    dated -- like using woodtype for a \"western\" feel."

  body: "It was a topic that occurred to me on a whim. I didn\u2019t have a particular
    period in mind. It is funny you mention wood type as I live in Florida\u2014which
    is technically Southern, ironically more so in North Florida\u2014and it is highly
    common to see that in use. Belizio, Clarendon, Knockout, some hand-lettering inspired
    type also appears to be the local flavor.\r\n\r\nThen again that is likely to
    be true beyond Florida and out of curiosity I was willing to take a risk and ask
    if a particular aesthetic could be identified in the way southerners use typography."

  body: "Not to give an answer, but more of a feeling -- the magnolia is obviously
    southern, and so symbolic you find it everywhere it will grow, including Southern
    California. The live oak is also southern, and I'd argue a better symbol for the
    \"southern\" also symbolized by the magnolia.\r\n\r\nWas the question directed
    at advertisig display, text for a novel, or just what?\r\n\r\n"

    closest thing would be as advertising display.\r\n\r\nVery much appreciate the
    interest, much better than \u201CChitlins.\u201D Thanks."

  body: "While I have no solid answer for you, I think the term Southern really is
    too open ended to have any real depth or sophistication for typography, unless
    you want a caricature. In that case, gritty with idiosyncracy and hand-done works.
    Roadside sign letter might work. You could probably get away with some \"western\"
    tropes.\r\n\r\nUnless you're looking for contemporary southern typography, in
    which case you might want to pick up a regional design annual or two."
