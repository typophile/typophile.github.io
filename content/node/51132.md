  on WhatTheFont and I think it's a beautiful, old-fashioned industry type. Best I
  can come up with is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/ministry/bold/ | Ministry
  Bold]], but the B and especially this weird W don't fit. \r\nDo anyone of you have
  suggestions?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BAER_6602.jpg]"

  body: "Could be hand-drawn, reason why: some typical beginner\u2019s mistake: all
    strokes have the same widhts (middle stroke of B is too fat, the roundings of
    B are too thin; look at W and A). The whole looks like made on a grid."

  body: Of course. And then one gets the strange proportions of a too narrow A and
    a too wide E, for example, or a top-heavy B. Just saying that it might not actually
    be a typeface, because for a reasonable text face that W would be far too dark
    and the counter of A far too small. So maybe just drawn for the purpose of putting
    together those two words.

  body: "Thanks for your comments! \r\nI agree, something very strange going on here.
    And the idea that it might be handdrawn occurred to me too: the wideness of the
    E, the condensed W  (@JWeltin: your suggestion of a grid is illuminating - that's
    why it looks like it's a monospace)- looks like something someone might have come
    up with to put on a soccer jersey or something - there's still some strange beauty
    in it though.\r\nThanks again - I found Ministry thanks to this!"
