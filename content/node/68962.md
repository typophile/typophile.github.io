    to me it doesn't look like that: watch how the letters are connected)\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: A number of the characters are similar to those in my faux-Thai font, Owah
    Tagu Siam NF. I would provide a link, but myfont.com's servers are swamped at
    the moment....

  body: "It's \"faux-Thai\" because, obviously, it's not a \"real\" Thai font :-)\r\n(See
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script\">wikipedia.org/Thai_script</a>
    for what that looks like, or google \"thai script\" images.)\r\n\r\nThe idea is
    similar to faux Chinese (those awful restaurant chopsticks fonts) and faux Arabic
    (and of these, I've seen a couple very good ones!): use the general shapes of
    another script to form Latin characters with.\r\n\r\nFirst time I see a Thai one;
    done very well!"
