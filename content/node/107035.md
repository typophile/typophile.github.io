body: "Being unsatisfied with all of the default fonts on my Kindle, I've decided
  to edit the \"Caecilia\" to my size requirements. \r\nI just want to slightly increase
  in height and width the character. I've tried to do so with the trial edition of
  High-Logic FontCreator, and with Birdfont and FontForge, but in all of them I couldn't
  find the way to do it.\r\n\r\nAgain- just changing the width and height of the character
  (not in the same ratio!). not spacing, not position. In any free software. Please
  help. \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I believe the trial version of Glyphs has full functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't recommend scaling a font this way, there are likely to be rounding errors,
    and spacing, kerning and hinting implications. Choosing different ratios for x-
    and y-scaling will also mess up the stroke modulation. There may also be legal
    restrictions on editing Caecilia, you need to check the EULA.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah yes, not necessarily, it's true. \r\n\r\nOut of interest, does the kind
    of parametric software you show there work just as nicely for designs with strong
    diagonal contrast? The interface allows vertical and horizontal curved sections
    to be programmed, but there may be cases where other widths are more primary to
    the design."

    general it does; it\u2019s in use for more than a year in DTL\u2019s font production
    now. That being said, I\u2019m pretty sure that despite this functionality is
    quite amazing, one surely will encounter cases where some thorough corrections
    are inevitable. But it remains amazing, IMHO \u2013although I\u2019m a bit biased.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n\r\n"

  body: Indeed, it looks like a very useful tool. I wish I had more time (and budget!)
    to explore all the options.
