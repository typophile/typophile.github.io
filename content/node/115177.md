body: "Hello people,\r\n\r\nI've had a growing interest in type design for about a
  year now, and this is perhaps my 4th attempt at a simple sans face. I just want
  to force myself to bring a project to completion, and produce a typeface that doesn't
  look too amateurish, even if it turns out very plain.\r\n\r\nI was hoping for some
  feedback and suggestions about anything which you think stands out as needing some
  work. I'm still pretty new to this, but looking to learn\u2014so please be kind!\r\n\r\n-
  - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nPlease note, so far I've only been working on drawing
  the glyphs, and the metrics are just done automatically in Illustrator just now.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  please ignore the 'Pro' tag on the name and the MyFonts promo look; I was just playing
  around :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile1-02_3963.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile1-03_4793.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile1-04_4572.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile1-05_5261.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile1-06_5392.png]"

    biggest problems are the binocular \"g\" (going too low, and leaning clockwise)
    and the \"j\" (troublesomely wide descender). In the caps, neither \"M\" is good.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    move away from Illustrator and to a proper font editor ASAP.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, it's looking good. And applause for \"the Lostry\"; that must be one
    of the cleverest names I've seen.\r\n\r\n\"S\" is leaning to the right.\r\n\r\nTop
    of \"f\" looks a bit heavy and its curvature seems slightly out of place. Copying
    from \"t\" may serve better.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw your \"Q\" I thought \"Ah, what
    European country is he from, then?\" Designers whose home language doesn't ordinarily
    use \"Q\" often seem to think of it as \"O with line diacritic below.\" It's not
    <em>wrong,</em> but the disconnection is a little more stylized than readers of
    English usually expect in text. I think that more alternates are called for, and
    that the default should be like the first one but with a short vertical stroke
    to connect the existing shapes together."

  body: "Not bad. Agree with the comment on the Q. It looks nice in isolation but
    in context it doesn't really work for me.\r\n\r\nThe angle and length of the 'slash'
    on your \xD8 and \xF8 is wrong. 60\xB0 is way too much. Bring it down to 45\xB0
    at least, and don't let the line extend (optically) below baseline or above x-height,
    definitely not past the overshoot.\r\n\r\nAnd take hrant's advice on moving to
    a font editor asap - you're creating work for yourself labouring in illustrator."

  body: "<strong>Firstly, thanks for the quick responses, I really appreciate the
    feedback. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hrant:</strong> I tried to draw the double-storey
    g with a shorter descender, but it wasn't working for me\u2014do you think that
    the double-storey g needs to descend less, or would it be sufficient to match
    it with the other descending letters?\r\n\r\n<strong>Cerulean:</strong> I'm actually
    a native English speaker from the UK! When I drew the disconnected Q I was basically
    just trying to do something different from the Qs I had drawn in previous typefaces\u2014and
    when I began I suppose I was aiming more at a display face than a text face (the
    proportions used to be much more classical, but they've evened out as time went
    on). \r\n\r\n<strong>Hrant & Osamu:</strong> Actually, this is the first typeface
    where I opted to draw my glyphs in the font editor from the start; when I said
    that I was using Illustrator for the metrics, I just meant that I haven't spaced
    or kerned the font properly yet, and have been using the 'Optical Kerning' setting
    on Illustrator when making specimen text compositions like those I posted above.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks
    for all the suggestions, I'll do some more work and then post some more images
    up after!</strong> \r\n\r\n"

  body: "To me the binocular \"g\" is the first (and often only) glyph that has to
    look a bit ungainly (in terms of being vertically squooshed, and appearing slightly
    too small) for something much more important \u2013namely good vertical proportions\u2013
    not to go out of whack. Normally this applies to text faces, while this design
    is more in the display realm... which makes me think you might be better off with
    a monocular \"g\". But if you stick with a binocular one try making the bottom
    open (like in Meta).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
