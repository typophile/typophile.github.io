  & I've had some great time reading both original posts as the replies to my own.\r\nWhat
  started as a site to escape to whenever boredom struck me quickly became like a
  second home to me.\r\nI've had my share of laughs here & also some minor disputes,
  but all in all, it's been a great experience sharing thoughts with all of you. Due
  to certain circumstances I won't be posting anything new here for x time, so to
  all of you who are awaiting an answer from me: my sincere apology. I'll be reading
  new posts still, but as off now I'm retiring myself from participating in any threads.
  I really appreciate all the constructive ideas & links I've gotten from each and
  everyone of you & I'll do my best to keep up with any new posts, albeit in a merely
  passive way (I'll keep my profile active). Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone
  in my interests ;-)\r\nKeep up the good work & maybe we'll meet again some day!\r\n\r\nKind
  regards,\r\n\r\nTom Lukacs - ill sans"

    a kick out of your wickedly great <em>nom de screen</em> and avatar... and enjoy
    your contributions to many threads here... Thanks especially for your encouragement
    with <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30114\">Barrio</a>, which I still have
    to finish.  ;-D Best wishes to you, and I sure hope we see you around here again!\r\n\r\nAll
    the best,\r\nRicardo\r\n\r\n:-)"

  body: "Thanks everyone!\r\nTo Ricardo: everything I've said in your or any other
    thread has been sincere. I really think Barrio has a lot of potential!\r\nIt's
    nice to know some people -who you don't even know personally- will actuallly miss
    your comments & contributions.\r\nI honoustly hope to be back soon, but I'm sure
    I'll check in every now and then (more often than I'd like to admit) on Typophile.
    I just have too much on my head right now to participate in any threads... Just
    don't consider that as a lack of interest. I enjoy reading almost everything here
    on Typophile & I've learned a lot in the year that I've been a member. I can't
    promise to be back someday, but for what it's worth, I'd like to thank all of
    you for your insights/inspiration/comments...\r\nAll my best wishes to all of
    you! And thanks again for the above!"
