<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello,
I was just wondering... perhaps a bit early... what you think about my new letter e (my first self made letter e that is). A few months ago I worked quite a lot with the cooper, tyke and sauna typefaces and found myself drawing this e last week in the train.
I used the little serif of the e to make the serifs of the other letters quickly in illustrator, but I was just wondering what you think of this e. =)))
Hmz.. knowing what other people post here I know this is not much... but I was just wondering if this would make a happy little alphabet that is worth pursuing further...
Thanks (as always) for your feedback! =)
Ave a nice day!</div>

<div class=commentbody>hmz... Is it really that bad or should i have made up a nicer story to go with the e to get some replies?</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's hard to tell the character of the alphabet from only a few letters, how the strokes vary and what the specific features of the font might be...maybe try a few more letters, then it will be easier to give suggestions.
It looks like it might be suitable for cartoony computer games...was that the idea?</div>

<div class=commentbody>It makes me think of chocolate cookies with jellowy stuff on them..it could be fun for a small cake shop, especially if you keep the weird blurby character of it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi... sorry for the extremely late reply.
I haven't had time to work on it for a long time. So no updates for now. I thought I'd receive emails when people would reply, so I haven't checked this post anymore since I didn't get any updates in my mail.
But it's nice to see that some people did reply to the post.
Very much appreciated.
Bendy I was just randomly drawing while sitting in the train to work and this letter was what I ended up with when I reached the last station. I didn't have any idea what to use it for (still don't)... I just thought that if I'd start drawing and making my own alphabet it would be a good learning curve to type design.
Thanks Flösser! Perhaps someday I will finish it and you never know... Maybe someday it might be used on something (although the company would have to be a "good" company... with good people and friendly animals and all that... I like those sorts of companies) =)
anyway... sorry for the late reply.. and tnx for taking the time to write something about my e =)
bye!
