    a Christmas card that you sell, or send in large quantities on behalf of a business
    \u2014\_could result in trouble. A friend of mine works in the licensing department
    of a team and frequently sues people and has their unauthorized merchandise destroyed.
    But if your project is strictly a non-business, personal Christmas card that you
    don't offer for sale, you should be fine."

  body: Thanks for the feedback everyone!  I have found a font on my one of my die
    cutting machines that is pretty close to the letter except the C.   Since I am
    only making 11 cards for the rest of the Cardinal nuts in my family I have traced
    and hand cut the 11 C's that I need.  Geeze the make it hard for fans!  :)
