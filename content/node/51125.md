body: "Hi everyone.\r\nAs my research project for hons, I am creating a hand-rendered
  typeface. Designed for use with the works of illustrative nature, where a regular
  crisp type might clash with the work. The plan is to have some weights and an italic.
  This will of coarse not be ready for the moderation (which is next week) however
  if people are interested in this, I will implement all that as well as open type
  features, and alternatives for every glyph based on the frequency of it's use in
  English language. For now I have a regular and a bold lc. I'm finishing the bold
  UC right now, and after that I an type-setting a few specimen posters and compiling
  a book of the process work for moderation. As part of my research, I am also encouraged
  to post about my progress on the blog. \r\n\r\nI would like to know what you all
  think, and when finished, would you consider using it. If there is enough interest,
  I will complete the typeface, and it will be available free from my website.\r\n\r\nhere's
  a link to my progress blog :\r\n\r\nhttp://victor-land.blogspot.com/"
