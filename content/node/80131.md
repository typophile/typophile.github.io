body: Looking for a modern font for a restaurant wordmark/logo. Needs to have a nautical
  feel but not cheesy, as the venue is very chic and unfussy. Any suggestions would
  be great!

    feel?\r\nScript faces can have an association of a fresh wind as well\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    thought I recommend some of the Aviano faces here. Nice look but too much graphic
    weaknesses. Gotham or Lapidaria are far better."
