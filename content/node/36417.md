    to bend bitmaps as George in order to make his point. Take the first image, the
    one he labels \u201CArial 14pt\u201D \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can generate
    that anti-aliased bitmap in any version of Windows at that size. \r\n\r\nIt's
    valid to complain that Microsoft hasn't updated the rendering in IE to take advantage
    of the latest versions of ClearType, but to fail to mention or consider WPF text
    rendering seems to be a deliberate omission."

  body: "The Arial image is just an example of what Anti-Aliasing *IS* - it's not
    a Windows image nor is it purported to be one. it's not an example of \"bad\"
    or \"good\" - just an exampe showing the difference between something that isn't
    and something that is anti-aliased.  I show manual examples directly after it,
    clearly also not indicative of Windows or Mac font rendering.\r\n\r\nFurther,
    it's specifically labeled as being rendered by Adobe Illustrator.  Keep reading
    the article and you'll find I touch rather sharply on the fact various software
    applications contain their own font rasterizing and layout engines.\r\n\r\nAll
    image samples are clearly labeled in the article including their source. They're
    all 100% authentic and very carefully verified to make sure they're accurate.
    \ You don't even have to worry about gamma issues of color correcting profiles
    because all PNGs in use at the site have been stripped of this meta-data, ensuring
    the images appear the same in all browsers on all platforms.\r\n\r\nBrun-o"

    be a good idea. The positioning of it, and the label indicates it's a Windows
    screen grab enlarged in illustrator.\r\n\r\nHow about WPF?\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "I have included an addendum mentioning WPF.  I hope you don't take offense
    to only including it this way. It's really not the point of the article, since
    I'm not really debating that Windows on a whole is inferior.  I've used Windows
    for 13 years. Still using it today, though my primary Machine is a Mac (have multiple
    of each in fact).\r\n\r\nFor XP WPF required installation of .NET and obviously
    is only available to .NET applications. This is not wholly different than how
    the system services in Mac OS work, but in that case it's something that exists
    on every system and used by every application that does not implement its own
    type rendering. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the Illustrator sample, I'm about to make
    a significant addition to it as well as move the image up so it doesn't immediately
    follow the mention of Windows.  The image was generated on a Mac but should be
    identical to one created with the same application version in Windows.\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, I'm not really a big fan of Arial.  I used it mainly because it was
    a short name I could fit multiple times horizontally within the page layout and
    it's a face a large number of people would instantly be familiar with.\r\n\r\nBruno"

  body: "Bruno's blog article makes a fair number of good points; he's right that
    Ou's original piece ignored/missed that OS X has sub-pixel anti-aliasing available,
    even if it's off by default. I happen to strongly disagree with the general thrust
    of his argument that OS X's full-fuzz anti-aliasing is a good thing, but without
    any actual studies on either side, that's mostly a subjective question right now.
    I was sad to see pointless ad hominem attacks which detracted from the strengths
    of the post, however.\r\n\r\nBut the post also appears to have some highly dubious
    assertions. One of them: \"The fact of the matter is that Windows implements font
    rasterization pretty much the way it always has.\" WTF?\r\n\r\nSi, isn't ClearType
    on by default in Vista, even for GDI apps? Even in XP, ClearType can be turned
    on - and it certainly isn't \"pretty much the way it always has.\" Plus, Bruno
    must not remember the Windows 3.1 days when there was no anti-aliasing, as best
    as I can recall.\r\n\r\nAnybody know when and with which version Windows added
    anti-aliasing? Font Bureau claims it was in 1999 in this article: http://type101.fontbureau.com/archives/19.
    In any case, I'm pretty sure they didn't have system-level anti-aliasing at all
    back in Windows 3.1. My point is just that Windows and Mac OS have made significant
    rendering changes several times over the years.\r\n\r\nAnother strange statement
    from Bruno: \"Your browser is likely using a different font rendering engine than
    your operating system as well.\"\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of Mac users
    are using Safari, which Bruno admits is using Mac OS's Quartz. The blog says it's
    aimed at Mac users. Something like 75-80% of Windows users are using IE, which
    is using Windows GDI rendering. Who exactly is Bruno talking to?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks Bruno,\r\n\r\nGlad to hear you're updating the article.\r\n\r\nI think
    you make the point in the article that these days we rarely see the system's default
    text rendering outside of the default browser, and even here the trends are changing
    \u2013 you mention Freetype in Firefox cross-platform, Quartz in Safari cross-platform,
    etc., and this matches what Adobe has been doing for years with Cooltype and Acrobat
    viewer even before that, and of course Word reading mode etc., etc., \r\n\r\nHence
    my position that the issue here is that IE\u2019s competitors have moved the bar
    re. rendering (user-preference apart) and that MS has failed to adequately react.
    MS has a better rendering story than GDI compatible widths ClearType, (which hasn\u2019t
    really changed since it was implemented in unreleased versions of Windows 2000)
    but users of IE haven\u2019t benefited from it. Don\u2019t know if you were at
    TypeCon, but I think one of the best parts of that event was hearing Bill Hill
    (who has moved from the MS Advanced Reading Technology team AKA ClearType team)
    to IE. If he can convince his team to move the needle on web typography, rendering
    etc., then we all benefit.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

    should be a meta-thread discussing these screenshots everyone is throwing around.
    Technically, it's necessary to have an actual display device and a human being
    present to assess things like legibility. So, it's not really possible to \"prove\"
    much just by displaying screenshots. For example, CRT intended output can only
    be judged by looking at the tube itself. There's  just a lot of variables in play.
    I imagine we'll be arguing about it until we all get resolution-independent OSes
    and some 200ppi displays. \r\n\r\nAre there any smug OLPC users out there?\r\nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Human_Interface_Guidelines/The_Sugar_Interface/Text_and_Fonts"

    Windows 95 plus! pack add-on. As I recall Laurence Penney (that cheeky hacker)
    produced a hack to activate it without Plus! Soon after we posted an official
    free download. One aspect not mentioned in the article was the MS philosophy of
    not applying antialiasing for single pixel stems, which was different from other
    approaches \u2013 hence you\u2019d never see the Arial sample in the article displayed
    like that until it jumped to two pixel stems.      "

  body: "I just lost the followup I posted in here by accidentally hitting a link
    in this tab instead of a new tab.  oops.\r\n\r\nLet's see if I can't get the gist
    however.\r\n\r\nYes, Windows' \"Font Smoothing\" was available when Windows 95
    was released and included in their first plus! pack - this is in my blog post.
    In fact I mention when anti-aliasing and ClearType came to each OS.\r\n\r\n\"Windows
    rasterizing\" - that's not to say \"anti-aliasing.\"  Both are part over rendering,
    but I was referring to the basic rasterizer which produces pretty much the same
    result in versions of dating back to 95.  Type rendering obviously includes rasterizing,
    anti-aliasing, kerning, etc. and the overall rendered effect we see now is not
    the same as it once was.  There's also no denying the vast amounts of legacy code
    that exists in all facets of every Windows framework.\r\n\r\nThe post was written
    as if speaking with the average readership of my site.  Since only I can see the
    logs and traffic data, only I know who's using which OS and browser to visit.
    \ IE accounts for under 9% of visits and Safari is under 50%.  The majority of
    people visit with a Moz-based browser, Firefox being the most popular of those.\r\n\r\n\"My
    buddy and I think Mac OS fonts look like crap\" is not how you write an article.
    \ I stick by my \"colourful\" and playful remarks regarding Ou. It's not the first
    time he's written such drivel and it will likely not be the last.\r\nIf one thinks
    Mac OS fonts are \"full-fuzz\" then I suspect that person doesn't spend much time
    around the OS. I use both mac OS and Windows every day and have for years. Each
    has benefits and of course issues.  Font rendering is a strength in Mac OS, not
    a weakness. I'm also a huge fan of FreeType and quite enjoy its results in Camino
    as well. Even spec'd it for a software project I designed a few years back.\r\n\r\n\r\nBruno"

    for mentioning WPF in the update, you're right you can't really take it seriously

    the fact that there were no fonts for the format didn't stop people claiming TrueType
