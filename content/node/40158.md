  body: 'Hey man like your site its clean as. If you like san serif I would go for
    Kris Sowersby''s National [[http://www.klim.co.nz/national_samples.php]] . Its
    very cool and has a lot of character. I chose to use Gotham from Hoefler and Frere-Jones
    which I like a lot also I believe my main man Sagmeister uses Gotham for his personal
    site.  '

    And its good.\r\n\r\nYou know what, I love it.\r\n\r\nSee, I love this Typophile
    site, I have worked 10 years with other designers in agencies\r\nand have been
    freelancing for 1 years.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna tell you that I do miss sharing design
    with other designers.\r\n\r\nThank you. This is a ''Wow''\r\n\r\nBut I am still
    open to other suggestions. Anybody.\r\n"
