    film fonts collection. From their site: <BR> <BR>HOUSE PURCHASES PHOTO-LETTERING
    COLLECTION <BR> <BR>House Industries has purchased one of the largest collections
    of film based display typography from New York-based Photo-Lettering, Inc. Photo-Lettering
    was a mainstay of the advertising and design industry in New York City from 1938
    into the early 1990s. PLINC, as it was affectionately known to countless art directors,
    was one of the earliest and most successful type houses to utilize photo technology
    in the production of commercial typography and lettering. It employed such design
    luminaries as Ed Benguiat and sold type drawn by the likes of Herb Lubalin, Milton
    Glaser and Seymour Chwast. The company is best know by most of today&#39;s graphic
    designers for its ubiquitous type catalogs it produced. <BR> <BR><a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?page=news"
