body: "I enjoy designing graphics on the ipad, but Apple had a strict policy which
  prevented installing one's  own fonts.  With the iOS 7 upgrade it is now possible
  to do so, but the process was complicated, necessitating converting your font first
  into a data string and writing a bit of code to create the fontname.mobilecionfig
  installation file.\r\n\r\nSome apps like inkpad (the great vecor drawing app) have
  their in-built method of installing your font through Dropbox.  But for regular
  iOS apps like Pages, do the following:\r\n\r\n1- Download  the \"iOS Font Maker\"
  \ freeware to your Windows, Mac or Linux(?) desktop from http://thehelpful.com/iosfonts/
  \  (It is not to be confused with  the \"iFont Maker\" on the  iTunes App Store
  which is a mini-Fontlab of sorts).\r\n\r\n2- Install iOS Font Maker and follow the
  instructions to create your fontname.mobilecionfig file.  Email the file to yourself.
  \r\n\r\n3. In the iOS 7  ipad or iphone etc. mail app, click on attached fontname.mobilecionfig
  file to download and install it with one click .  To uninstall  go to Settings /
  General / Profiles to see your new fonts listed.  \r\n\r\nIt works very well all
  thanks to its designer Keith.  Using inkpad or Pages on the ipad to see  your fonts
  during development is a great way to check their outline at all sizes, details and
  behaviour on Apple devices. Install-uninstall new versions as many times as needed."
