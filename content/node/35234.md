  body: Show us how you mean for it to be used. Type needs to have a job to do top
    be good and for you to be clear about your own priorities while you design it.
    I would rethink that C. It's just a cut O. The G too. The Has something weird
    & cool about it. It needs smoothing but that glyph is the main reason I would
    work on the others. It shows some promise. Look after it's lower left though.
    Somthing is wrong there. You W needs it's weights examined & corrected.

  body: The S has the weight in the wrong place(s). It needs to be on the spine mostly.

  body: "THanks all for the help so far.\r\nThe \"C\" and \"G\" have been opened up
    a little.\r\n\"V\" and \"W\" have been thickened, with an alternate double V \"W\"\r\nI'm
    wasn't satisfied with the \"E\", so I connected the top and bottom. -still not
    sure though\r\n\"S\" was thickened, \"Z\" has been made a bit narrower.\r\n\r\nEBEN:
    which character \"has something weird & cool\" ?\r\n\r\nMy intendion was to create
    something with the varied weight of a serifed font, but without the sharp corners.
    My inspiration is based loosely on Optima and block serifs.\r\n\r\nThe first post
    is in shades of grey. I was attempting to make larger glyphs lighter, smaller
    glyphs darker, to even out each character's presence (not sure if I'm making myself
    clear, though). Anyway, I've given up on that until I get the font finished.\r\n\r\nSorry
    I haven't got a sample text. I am saving up for Typetool, until then I have to
    manually arrange each character in Freehand if I want to make words.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I recentl realized that I miss-spelled \"Majescule\" -oops!\r\n\r\n-Nate"

  body: "Sorry I see I was hasty. The 'H' is the one I meant. It seems like it's the
    most finished and has the spirit of the face locked up in it.\r\n\r\n<cite>to
    even out each character\u2019s presence</cite>\r\n\r\nI know just what you mean.
    And it's starting to work.\r\n\r\nLook at your O. The weight there isn't quite
    right. Your R, P, A and X suggest weight in the upper right & lower left.\r\n\r\nAlso
    look at How it sets problem words like LAWYERS.\r\n\r\nLook after that K the bottom
    leg is weaker than it maybe should be.\r\n\r\nKeep pounding on it. It's getting
    better."
