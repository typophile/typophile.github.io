  and nobody here seems to know what it is. We only have an outline version that has
  been scanned and streamlined and the quality is horrible. (anyone remember Streamline?)
  We'd like to use the logo on a big sign so the quality has to be better than this.\r\n\r\nI
  know I've seen the font somewhere before, but I can't seem to put my finger on it.\r\n\r\nHelp
  me please.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Naamloos-1_6636.jpg]"
