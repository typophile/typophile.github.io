body: Designer fonts are not the only fonts.  There are web services that allow internet
  users to turn personal handwriting into a font.  Thus my post, "Font Website Usage
  Barriers and Monopoly" a few days ago has further need for implementation.  There
  are some things holding member participation websites from utilising personal handwriting
  fonts.  Webpage personalisation is a feature that has been put by various websites
  and having an easy personal handwriting font upload feature for example at internet
  forums, interactive websites, webmail, blogs, comments sections, review sections,
  personal pages and in other sites categories would allow expression via handwriting
  fonts.  The arguments related to commercial licensing fonts and their technicalities
  are much less for personal handwriting fonts.

  body: "You don\u2019t seem to know, how difficult it is to build a script font,
    if each letter of your handwriting is stored as character in a font. Your handwriting
    had to be split into characters and it had to be still your handwriting, if the
    letters of your scanned phrase are recombined. If you write text with your hands,
    a certain letter does not look exactly the same in all phrases, neither with regard
    to its shape nor with regard to its side bearings and expecially not today, where
    the handwriting of the most people is much more uneven than fifty years ago. Those
    automatic web services cannot work. They may be able to store images of handwritten
    phrases, but the result would not be a digitized typeface, but a phrase box only."
