    correct? They don\u2019t look the same to me."

  body: Yes, they are right. With calligraphic based forms there can be a bit of variation
    even though the digital stroke might look the same.

  body: N.B. I'm just saying that the chinese characters are correct, I'm not entirely
    sure what the "Na" "Sinn" and all this is about, but I didn't think you were asking
    about them.

  body: "They're not really \"dots\" but each is formed by originally pressing down
    with a calligraphic brush. When writing it now with a pen, it would be two strokes
    rather than two dots. The latter has a line because it's using the same principle
    as if I wrote \"it\" in english and had quite joined up writing so the dot of
    the i is merged with the crossbar of the t. \r\n\r\nNice to have that Norwegian
    cleared up, although I wondered why you had \"Mindfulness\" (yes, it's actually
    only got one 'l') written instead of its translation. "

  body: "Thanks for clearing that up, and the extra l is just because I only received
    the text and haven\u2019t read it yet. It says so because \u201CMindfulness\u201D
    is a meditation philosophy: a concept, more than a word, in this setting."
