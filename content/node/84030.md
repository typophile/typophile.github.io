  seeing it on something.\r\n\r\n...Just wondering if others have noticed, and what's
  causing its renewed popularity...."

  body: It's because it looks similar to Gotham, which blew up after Obama. People
    are going for the "Obama look" without the "Obama budget" and end up using Avenir.

  body: That's so funny you boys say that!! You totally read my mind. I used to see
    Gotham and smirk and go "Oh that's Avenir." And later I discovered I was wrong
    - it was Gotham. And when you really get down to it H+J totally ripped off Avenir
    with Gotham, though I do love it. They just changed some of the letters. The rest
    is totally Avenir. But in my opinion they should be practically sued.
