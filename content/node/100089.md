  Any similar fonts or any idea what font it is?

    most similar I could find are:\r\n\r\nMildred Fancy\r\nGf Script No 5\r\n\r\nThese
    are obviously not the same fonts, but hopefully will help a little."

  body: "considering you're talking about Nike here, i'd very much doubt it is something
    commercial. i've seen a version of the logo you provided in flat form, like a
    ribbon or folded piece of paper. betting heavily that they did some major modifications
    starting with a basic font and trailing the characters together.\r\n\r\nedit:
    so my suggestion would be, strip out the connections and get down to the base
    letters.\r\n\r\nre-edit: not that i'd suggest you forge the logo. i'm hoping you
    just want a similar effect."

  body: "yes, I want something similar, but I am clueless on typography design. \r\nI
    found this- look at the bottom font \"you know and a day\", it looks similar but
    can't ID it."

  body: Can't agree more with defiantone. Most probably a custom lettering to me.
    Anyway, reminds me of [[http://www.typophile.com/node/98672|this previous discussion]]
    about an old Nike logo.
