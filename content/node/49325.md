  am searching for some Sans Serif Families which can be an Alternate to Helvetica.\r\nThey
  should have a thin or ultra/extralight/light version too.\r\nTeh typeface should
  not look very humanistic - instead more straight! I already consider for example
  Akkurat/FF Din as Alternates, but i am not very satisfied.\r\n\r\nWould be thankful
  for every suggestion!\r\nBest, Adam\r\n"
