body: "HI \r\nI am french, that's maybe why I NEVER manage to use hints properly.\r\nif
  i generate PS1 automatic hints: when i print samples with xpress or illustator,
  some letters like U don't lay on the blue zone, some others, like E, just jump to
  the top blue zone. \r\nSo it's impossible to judge if my drawnings are correct or
  not!\r\nis there something i should know about that? please help!"

  body: I don't have a very technical understanding of this one, but my experience
    has been that these problems are usually caused by inprecise placement of points.
    Sometimes in the font editor it looks like the points are aligned correctly, but
    if you zoom way in you will see that they are off by one or two units. If the
    points at the top of your U are even one unit below the blue zone, it will render
    incorrectly. This is also true for overshoots that extend above the blue zone.

    body: "thank you christian\r\nin fact i generate automatic hintings (F7) \r\nit's
      ok with my laser printer over 14 points\r\nbelow (12, 10, 9...) that's bullshit\r\nis
      there a preference to click (like apply hints below 14 points or something like
      that) for it to work properly? "
