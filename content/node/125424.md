body: I'm trying to match a script font for a wedding invite for a family member.  I've
  separated all of the letters and ran them through a few different font matching
  utilities without any luck.  I was hoping to tap the brainpower here on typophile
  to see if someone recognizes this font or has a better matching capability as I
  do.  Any help is greatly appreciated!  I'm looking for the script font in the samples
  provided.
