  a used 3G, but I would rather  get something new or newer that I can afford. I just

  body: "I am awaiting some sample output from the Xerox Phaser 8560 and 8860 models.
    The former of these is less that $1000 (but the cost per page is higher). It's
    true Adobe PS3, and what Xerox call \u20182400dpi Fine Point\u2019; I don't know
    yet whether this is true 2400dpi or some kind of voodoo calculation. Neither of
    these machines do the large format page of the Xante; max size is US Legal."

  body: "An aging Xante might not be a great idea. Xante parts can be quite pricey.
    \r\n\r\nRicoh printers are a good option when the cost of the printer is a factor.
    I have not used Ricoh\u2019s 2400 DPI models, but the 1200 DPI PS3 Ricoh printers
    are just as good as Xerox printers for less money. The downside is that Ricoh
    printers use better toner (it\u2019s much darker and applies are more even tone)
    than most other printers, but that means that the cartridges cost more and from
    what I\u2019ve heard off-brand toners do not work. "

  body: I have a Xante 4G and a 3G. They are both 2400x2400 and are real workhorses.
    I and many other Xante users have given the company grief for getting out of the
    laser printer market, but I don't think they are going back. They seem to have
    a very nice niche in the short run digital printing and platemaking world.

  body: The Xerox Phasers are crap. Apparently what they consider 2400dpi is actually
    600dpi but in, ooh, four colours. 600dpi multiplied by 4 = 2400dpi, get it? As
    I was saying... voodoo calculation. Wankers.

  body: I contacted a guy who used to resell Xante printers for music printing. Apparently
    Xante told him they could still build laser printers if they received custom orders.
    I hate to think how much that would cost though.

  body: For many years, I have not owned a printer, because it made more sense to
    take test jobs to a service bureau and get a variety of output than to invest
    in a single printer to have at home. But as Hrant points out, getting any kind
    of 2400dpi output from anywhere is becoming difficult now. If it were not for
    the chemical smells and space required, I'd be tempted to buy a secondhand imagesetter.

    having \u201CPostscript 3 emulation\u201D it was in fact a true Postscript printer,
    and even has the logo on the box. It makes shopping extremely irritating."

    being unrealistic in terms of what font users/readers will end up seeing.\r\n\r\n>
    If you can do 2400 then do it both directions.\r\n\r\nWell, one is the direction
    of the physical travel mechanism, the other is the electrostatic resolution of
    a single imaged line. So if a manufacturer gets a sufficiently better deal on
    acquiring one of the two technologies versus the other, asymmetrical resolution
    is a way to help the price point of the product while appearing to give higher
    resolution. Scanners have this issue too (and then some).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
