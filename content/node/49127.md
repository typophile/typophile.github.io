  any differences between Helvetica and Nimbus Sans. Are there any features that would
  allow one to clearly differentiate between the two? I like Helvetica and I personally
  find Nimbus sans essentially a clone of Helvetica. I could not tell the difference
  if I would see a text and I would be asked which of the two types was used.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for the input "

  body: "In Robert Norton's wonderful book 'Types Best Remembered/Types Best Forgotten',
    Dr Peter Karow of URW explains that the many errors in Helvetica were first fixed
    by Berthold, then by Linotype with Helvetica Neue, and finally by URW in Nimbus,
    which some would argue was the best version, as it took advantage of all the preceding
    work. Karow also makes a persuasive case for Max Miedinger as the designer of
    Helvetica, and pours scorn on Linotype for minting money on Helvetica while letting
    its designer die a pauper. \r\n\r\nAn interesting sidelight Karow points out is
    that when Adobe first developed ATM, they couldn't get any of their versions of
    Helvetica to work with it. They had to come to URW for completely fresh data.\r\n\r\nJames
    of course is right: your clients will never know."

  body: "In my previous post I relied on memory without checking the facts first.
    Going back to what Dr Karow actually wrote, there are some slight differences
    (i.e. Neue came after Nimbus; Miedinger was complaining about Stempel (later absorbed
    into Lino). Here it is, a great little nugget of typeface history from one of
    the great participants:\r\n\r\n<em>I started the IKARUS program late in 1972.
    In February 1973 we had completed the digitizing and plotting parts, so we could
    produce the first typefaces. My first customer was Walter Florenz Brendel from
    Dusseldorf. He had prepared the master characters for digitizing in a large size.
    As we do it today: 6 inches for bodysize. It was the typeface Olympia. I asked
    him whether he drew the characters himself: 'No, my designer did it.' They were
    inked and black/white. Later we used just pencil drawn contours. Then he added
    after severe questioning: 'Yes, the typeface is very close to Helvetica of the
    Stempel AG.' (formerly part of today's Linotype-Hell AG) In 1976, I met with Max
    Miedinger. He said, 'I am the designer of the famous Helvetica. I did it in 1957.
    Now, Stempel earns lots of money with it, but I am out of the game. I feel cheated.'
    In 1977, we digitized the Helvetica originals with IKARUS from large friskettes....
    We got that service contract from Stempel AG in Frankfurt. In 1978, we digitized
    Holsatia, a Helvetica-clone made by the Hell company. In 1980 we digitized SANS
    for IBM. They never used it. In 1981, we helped the Typoart company in the DDR
    to digitize their Maxima, another clone of Helvetica. I guess this was the best
    data we ever made. One font (800 char.) included also Greek and Cyrillic and lots
    of accented characters. In 1982, we digitzed the Akzidenz Grotesk Buch for the
    Berthold company; I viewed it as another clone of Helvetica, as did Rene Kerfante,
    manager of the Stempel AG. In 1983, Hermann Zapf started the design of our typeface
    URW Grotesk because a very big publishing company (Axel Springer) wanted to have
    a sans serif alternative typeface. In 1985 we did our Nimbus Sans tyepface, a
    merger out of Helvetica, AG Buch, Hosatia, and others. We tried to avoid some
    of the mistakes with the old Helvetica. In 1986/87, the Stempel AG produced the
    Neue (New) Helvetica. They cloned themselves, but called it a new and innovative
    design. In 1987, we digitized the Arial typeface for Monotype, another clone.
    This time, Rene Kerfante, being manager at Monotype convinced me that Arial is
    very different from Helvetica. In 1990, we delivered new data of Helvetica to
    Adobe because they could not handle their old data of Helvetica with ATM. They
    wanted a clean start. In 1992, we made our URW TypeWorks product (500 masters
    +Inline, Outline, Relief, Shadow and Round). Now, one can have Nimbus Sans as
    a 'sixpack'. In 1993, Stefan Rogener (a typograph living in Hamburg) made statistics
    on the use of typefaces in the advertising branch. He came out with: 'By more
    than 90%, the creatives use Helvetica, Futura, Garamond, and Baskerville. They
    are stupid. Give me a pistol.' He is still alive. But Max Miedinger died in the
    late seventies, poor and without glory. I can't forget Helvetica.</em>"

  body: "Thank you for all for the replies. I am really new to this field and I am
    very interested to find as much a possible about font design. \r\n\r\nI like very
    much Helvetica (and Nimbus Sans) and for some reason I dislike Arial so I wanted
    to kind of understand how a type designer looks at similar fonts, and what are
    the critical elements one would consider when differentiating between very close
    designs, besides the aesthetic element. \r\n\r\nFor instance there are fonts that
    technically are very close in design but the overall impression, the optical effect
    is totally different - at least that's how I look at Arial vs. Helvetica.  \r\n\r\nAnother
    reason I am interested in this topic is that I recently decided to learn font
    design. Sans serif's are my preferred types, because of their clean appearance,
    readability and wide potential usage. As an exercise I decided to attempt to draw
    a simple sans serif font (for my own use) to replace Arial. Of course the font
    looks almost identical to Helvetica at this point... and it is more like a sketch
    at this stage. \r\n \r\nI posted the early results in another forum (Critique)
    and I would be very interested in your feedback. Besides working on curve smoothing
    and making sure that the stems have equal weights I am now trying to give the
    font a more distinct appearance without\r\nlosing the elements that I like in
    \  fonts like Helvetica. One of the things that I tried so far is to give some
    fonts a more squarish appearance - as much as possible without altering readabillity.\r\n\r\nPlease
    look at this post and let me know what you think. Thanks\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/49228\r\n\r\n\r\n"
