    seems to work from bitmap models for many &#40;if not all?&#41; of her fonts.
    I wonder if Mrs Eaves works as well? <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' She also hand-tunes the Mac bitmap fonts in her suitcases instead of foolishly
    trusting Fog to do a perfect job of it. The PC versions of Emigre fonts unfortunately
    lack this feature. <BR> <BR>With full-fuzz antialiasing becoming the norm &#40;or
    as Adam Twardoch likes to call it, full-alcohol&#41; bitmaps in newer suitcases
    are becoming rarer and rarer. I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to add embedded
    bitmap data to CFF .otf files. '

    cannot contain bitmaps, and bitmaps are better. But PC TrueType fonts can contain
    bitmaps. They can both contain hinting, but even TT&#39;s powerful hinting can&#39;t
    compare to the real thing. <BR> <BR>BTW, John, maybe BitFonter can do OTF? <BR>
