    body: "I think you're right... Walbaum, or darn close to it. I don't know why
      I always blank on Walbaum when I'm looking for fonts... I like it a lot, just
      never seem to use it. And it's so far down on the (alphabetical) list, I'm too
      tired of looking at other faces to catch it; gotta start working my way up from
      the bottom occasionally.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot... I'm using the logo in a presentation,
      and had an Illutrator file that used HElvetica, but the web site clearly uses
      the newer serif face. EVery local Blue Cross seems to have a slightly different
      take on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
