  body: "Surpising, I didn't hit this with a quick run through of the usual categories
    for this type of font [techno, sci fi, futuristic, automotive etc.] either at
    Dafont or Myfonts. Hope someone finds it for you.\r\nIts not too difficult to
    make using Serpentine Sans ICG Bold Oblique\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/serpentine-sans/\r\nJust
    delete the dots on i, thin the center horizontal stroke of s, fill in the ink
    traps, and the casual reader would probably not notice any difference.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SerpentineSansBoldObliqueEdited_3477.jpg]\r\nA
    little additional work and you could have a perfect match.\r\nDon"

  body: Why do people keep asking for font IDs in the Critique section. How is that
    even slightly appropriate? I'm dealing with fury here.
