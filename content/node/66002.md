  the rule is sentence case, and has near enough been a given in typography. I wonder

  body: "Deja-vu. Here is an old post from a \"research questions\" discussion thread
    from a type facebook group I have. If you'd like to join you can find me at facebook.com/readthetype.
    The group is \"invisible\" to give people a little more privacy.\r\n\r\n<strong>1.
    Downstyle</strong>\r\n\r\nDown style means capitalizing only the first word and
    proper nouns, typically applied to titles. For example:\r\n\r\nThis is a title
    in down style \u2014 Microsoft Word calls this \"sentence case\"\r\n\r\nThis Is
    A Title In Up Style \u2014 Microsoft Word Calls This \"Title Case\"\r\n\r\nHere
    is a paragraph set in up style:\r\n\r\nDon't You Find This Annoying To Read? Imagine
    An Entire Book Written This Way. I Highly Doubt That You Would Finish It, Unless
    Of Course you Were Some Sort Of Typographic Masochist. Perhaps There Is Something
    Written In Robert Brownjohn's Book Sex And Typography About Typographic Masochism.
    I Think I Have Made My Point.\r\n\r\nHere is the same paragraph set in down style:\r\n\r\nDon't
    you find this annoying to read? Imagine an entire book written this way. I highly
    doubt that you would finish it, Unless of course you were some sort of typographic
    masochist. Perhaps there is something written in Robert Brownjohn's book Sex and
    Typography about typographic masochism. I think I have made my point.\r\n\r\nNotice
    how the the beginning of sentences, the title of the book, it's author and the
    personal pronoun \"I\" are more salient?\r\n\r\nTypographic convention, and I
    stress the word *convention*, gives us the following reasons why down style is
    preferable to up style.\r\n\r\na) 80% of the time words appear set in lowercase
    letters resulting in a more familiar word shape (bouma).\r\n\r\nb) Proper nouns
    like Your Name get a little more prominence and stand out as the proper nouns
    that they are.\r\n\r\nc) It leaves less chance for a title that breaks on to two
    lines to be misinterpreted as two separate titles.\r\n\r\nd) You don't have to
    play the \"should I capitalize of, it, and, or, the &c ?\" game.\r\n\r\nThere
    may be others that I am not aware of. I do know however from my time working with
    bilingual government clients that down style is a common convention used in French.\r\n\r\nIn

  body: "All very well Christopher but when you are typesetting a 4-5 word headline
    (even less if I can manage it), word recognition is not an issue. What is an issue
    is what words you want to emphasize, like your example of I and proper names.
    So you do that by case, or color, or different weights, there are many methods.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not scientific but it works.\r\n\r\nNo one in their right mind would use \"title
    case\" for extended text.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "<cite> > If the first is Title case, what is the second, which is what I
    would prefer to see in a title, with smaller words of low import in lower case.</cite>\r\n\r\nDon,
    the first is an example of title case as generated by a machine, which can't tell
    a pronoun from a preposition from an article. Your second example is closer to
    proper title case (<em>aka</em> headline style).\r\n\r\nProper headline and title
    writing in upstyle follows rules for which words get capitalized. Generally, prepositions
    and articles do not get capitalized. Style guides will vary on a few details.
    Some of the \"rules\" are admittedly arbitrary and not logically rigorous.\r\n\r\nBut
    generally, it has less to do with length of word and more to do with function.
    Thus, your second example would usually have the <em>is</em> capitalized by most
    editors I know: \"This Is a Sample of Title Case.\"\r\n"

    could decide.\r\n\r\nI feel the same way about punctuation, unless something is
    utterly incorrect, and even that can work. Commas are like rests in music, do
    you want the person to pause, or not? The worst copywriters in my experience are
    usually English majors, who know all the rules and cannot break them.\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\n"
