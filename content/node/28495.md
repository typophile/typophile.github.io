  and, lo and behold, the new design!\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of the question that
  i always had: what's the difference between the FontFont and the FontShop store?
  I'm guesing that the former sells foundry-specific, and the later, an ecletic mix
  of typefaces. Anyone care to clarify?\r\n\r\nAlso, Mr. Coles, will the FontShop
  store and Typographica be redesigned soon like you said :) ?"

  body: "Glad you noticed the little refresh, Bram. \r\n\r\nYou have it right. FSI
    FontShop International sells fonts from many foundries at FontShop.com. FontFont
    is the \"house brand\" and its fonts are available both at FontFont.com and FontShop.com.
    Personally, I prefer the experience of FontShop.com, but the prices are the same
    at both sites.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com\">FontFont</a>
    is a foundry.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com\">FontShop</a> is a reseller.\r\n\r\nOther
    facts: FontFont is one of the oldest digital foundries and just celebrated its
    15th anniversary. FSI is celebrating with <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fiffteen/\">FiFFteen</a>,
    a traveling exhibit.\r\n\r\nAs for your last question: yes and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/246221021/\">yes</a>."
