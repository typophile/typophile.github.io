body: Does anyone here know how to deal with he sale of licenses for downloadable
  software? I&#39;m always keen on learning about all things licensing, but this time
  I have even an application for that knowledge <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Thing is, I want to sell both my licenses of Dreamweaver
  MX and Conribute 2 from Macromedia. They&#39;re just catching dust on my hard-drive
  sind I don&#39;t use them anymore since some months. <BR> <BR>This is not just a
  shameless plug for the selling, but also to find out if I can actually do that without
  getting my booty mistreated by Macromedia&#39;s Lawyer Collection &#40;also version
  MX I think&#41;.  <BR> <BR>would be glad to get some insight on that. <BR> <BR>cheers,
  <BR> <BR>fj

  body: I would have thought the licenses themselves would clue you in to the process.
    Can you post the licenses here?

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have a real clue &#40;just a fake one&#41; if I can sell
    it, since Macromedia can never be absolutely sure that I won&#39;t use the software
    upon selling it. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: License-53577.html*mime_html.gif*text/html*23.3*EULA+Contribute+3*License%2ehtm

    <BR> <BR>This is the EULA of Contribute 3 Preview, I hope they&#39;re not too
    different on this topic. I already deleted Contribute 2. <BR> <BR>thanks. <BR>fj'
