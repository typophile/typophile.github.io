  working on my graduation project.\r\n\r\nI'm won't bore you with all the details
  of the whole project*, but at this point I'm creating an A5 product guide for The
  Consumer\u2122 (that ubiquitous and equally mysterious individual that we are always
  hearing about). The final product will be mostly viewed as a PDF document on a website,
  with a limited run of printed copies.\r\n\r\nI have all my content and images sorted
  and now I'm trying to get grid and type choices right:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post4_12_5331.jpg]\r\n\r\nBecause
  of work already completed, the headings must be in ChaletComprime CologneSixty (House),
  but the rest can be changed..\r\n\r\nWould love some criticism, suggestion, etc,\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nDan
  Flan\r\n\r\n*If you are really keen to learn said details, I have been running a
  blog ([[http://danflan.com.au/madisonave]]) to track the progress of the project
  which has everything on it\u2014feedback on the work posted there would also be
  greatly appreciated\r\n"

  body: "I worry that your subheads (\"UNDERSTANDING THE CONSUMER\" and \"CREATING
    DEMAND\" are pulling too much attention from the start of the text... my eye goes
    to the second column first. The All caps first line just looks like a weak attempt
    to distract me at that point. \r\n\r\nCould you possibly put all this text in
    one column? Maybe reduce the subheads' size?"

  body: "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nYeah you are right about those headings, they are a bit
    distracting, I'll rethink them,\r\n \r\n\r\nMaybe make a few changes to the lead
    paragraph?\r\n\r\nI'm also struggling with the caption in the picture\u2014I realise
    it's a mess at the moment.. Any suggestions on how I should tackle that one?\r\n\r\nAs
    for your suggestion about squeezing it into one column, I probably could (and
    should) do that for the final layout of this page, but at the moment I'm just
    trying to get the groundwork done for the document as a whole, so its spread across
    two columns to help me figure out rules for formatting all other pages\r\n\r\nCheers
    \r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "I've done a little bit of updating based on those suggestions,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post4_2_3840.jpg]\r\n\r\nAgain,
    this particular layout wouldn't actually be set like this \r\nThe copy wouldn't
    be split into two paragraphs across two columns like it is\u2014only like this
    at the moment so I can figure out how two columns of text would work on other
    pages. As Scott suggested, this layout would probably be reduced to one column,\r\n\r\nIdeas,
    criticisms, suggestions etc. would be much appreciated,\r\n\r\nDan"
