  body: Mediterranean cuisine might have some firm essence about it, but I don&#39;t
    think that&#39;s true of letters. For one thing, there are probably around half
    a dozen writing systems &#40;not counting the dormant ones&#41; on its shores,
    including two &#40;or even three&#41; that are as distinct as they are significant.

  body: Okay, I understand ... more specifically ... perhaps a font that might some
    how have a flare to it like Arabic letters. <BR>lk

  body: 'That&#39;s a more focused -but also pretty challenging- question. <BR> <BR>When
    looking for Arabicized Latin fonts&#42; most people choose stuff that&#39;s caricature,
    like FF Falafel. Maybe because anything deeper requires an understanding of the
    roots of letterforms &#40;and not just the roots of Latin&#41;. In the display
    realm this can actually work &#40;sometimes&#42;&#42;&#41; but in the text realm
    -which is all about subtlety- it can&#39;t. In the text realm you have to shoot
    for a mere &#34;atmosphere&#34; of Arabic. To me a really good way to do this
    is to use a Latin font with reverse contrast, like certain designs by Excoffon
    or Bloemsma. The latter&#39;s Balance for example has a lot of potential here.
    There&#39;s also a font &#40;I forget the name&#41; that was shown on Typophile
    - it was by a South American designer - which combines reverse contrast with that
    &#34;fauve&#34; feeling typical of Latin and Eastern European culture. I can track
    it down if you like. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, check out the Arabicized <i>Cyrillic</i>
    font in this post: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/49453.html"

    <BR>&#42;&#42; Perhaps the best example is Mo by <a href="http://www.toko.ne"
    target="_blank">www.toko.ne</a>, which can be seen in the current issue of Spatium
    magazine. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I feel as though I stepped into another world with the depth of your answer.  What
    a creative mind and command of expression to describe what it is that I&#39;m
    looking to see <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0>  Falafel is more or less what I am after ... Arab Brushstroke probably
    has &#34;it&#34; too, although to my eye, I&#39;m not sure what &#34;it&#34; is
    just yet and Arab Brushstroke looks pretty normal.  <BR> <BR>Falafel isn&#39;t
    available without purchasing an expensive bundle.   <BR> <BR>If you can think
    of another similar, that is available I would be most grateful. <BR> <BR>Thanks,

  body: $40 for that bundle is not so bad; you get three fonts that work together
    well and give you lots of creative options. <BR> <BR>Still, if price is driving
    you, check out these single weights from Linotype, which are $22 each, I think

    &#40;More Persian though&#41; <BR>But do stay away from Linotype&#39;s Arabdream
    - what a disaster. <BR> <BR>Another font you might consider &#40;although I think
    it&#39;s experimental or at least unfinished&#41; is this: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/33943.html"
