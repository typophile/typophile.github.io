body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nHere's my first attempt to font design. I am an architect, \r\nand
  letters are constructed, same round parts and same corners mixed.\r\nSet of capitals
  only. I hope it can work as a title text for a magazine. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think
  about the lack of the stroke contrast at Z & S glyphs?\r\nNumbers are a little bit
  lower than letters, but now I am not sure about that decision (?)\r\n2, 3, 5, 7
  are also narrow and I like it, but maybe I should try to match it with the rest
  ?\r\n7 probably isn't balanced but I can't find better angle now,\r\nits hard to
  play with S stroke and avoid kinks ughhh\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\n(sample 2 - with
  no final spacing)"

    is straight on the outside.\r\nPinching Z in the middle seems like a good idea.
    S would not hold up to that, but as it is, it obviously doesn't belong.\r\nReally,
    all the C, G, S terminals may best be changed to something different. Perhaps
    this is where you bring in a cue from the numerals.\r\nI would expect something
    more interesting from the Q tail, but I should note for full disclosure that I
    find myself saying that to a lot of people."

    convinced by the sharp cuts (on |E|, etc.)."

  body: "Thank you both for sharing opinion, its good to hear your doubts. Probably
    I'll change terminals to rounded although I am afraid of blob fonts. Previously
    I tried to use my basic shape for numerals but it wasn't successful so I decided
    to match only other attributes and make them less flourished.\r\nI'll post the
    changes soon."
