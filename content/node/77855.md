body: "Today I am using Stag and Stag Rounded in MS Word and am finding the word spacing
  is too narrow. Words and numbers are merging together. I've tried double spacing
  but of course that looks like double spacing \u2014 I only need maybe 20% more space
  between words. I suppose I could up the point size of the spaces, but would then
  need to readjust the leading. Does anyone know a better way to fix this?"

    to 120% (unfold the dialog box at the More button and use the Format button/menu).
    I''m not sure about the menu/command names as my Word is in Portuguese, but it
    works.'
