  body: It's the logo of a famous US record label. It is a '60s design but it is not
    probably not a typeface but custom lettering. Have a search under "psychedelic"
    on myfonts and you might find something similar, but most of those will be recent
    interpretations of psychedelic hand lettering rather than typefaces used at the
    time. There's a few threads here that might be useful too, such as [[http://typophile.com/node/76156]].

  body: Oldnick, this is very close indeed! Fredricksburg looks like the sample, but
    on a diet, my samples are fuller and more exaggerated. Can someone find a closer
    match?

title: Can anyone identify this typeface? No one yet can identify it. I think that
  it's from the sixties.
