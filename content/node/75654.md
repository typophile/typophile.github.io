body: 'I am working on a logo that has two words in it, both starting with the letter
  "S". While I can''t disclose the name, it is in the entertainment industry (film,
  interactive, gaming, etc.). I need to make it look "cutting edge, modern, smooth,
  efficient." Fonts that come to mind include: Bank Gothic, Neo Sans, Klavika, Square
  721. So far no luck using these. Could you please give me input on fonts that fit
  the above criteria? Thanks! '

    you think the experimental <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/morphica.html\">Morphica</a>
    (which has an interesting \"S\") is cutting edge, or pass\xE9 deconstruction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Thanks for answering. Eras, to me, is too friendly to be considered modern.
    I looked at Morphica and, IMHO, it tries too hard to be modern and thus becomes
    self defeating. A few others I''ve considered: Convection, Soho Gothic and Oblik
    Bold. Others I looked at but didn''t use were Proxima Nova, Conduit, Din Next,
    Etelka, Euphoric, Pill Gothic, Fago, Fedra, Gotham, Interstate, Politica and Unit.
    I''ve run the gamut of modern sans serifs. If there are others worth a look, please
    feel free to mention them.'
