    an exact match or just something similar?

  body: "Ricardo\r\n\r\nThis font seems to be used throughout the magazine as well
    as on the masthead. I'd like to find something really close - I've looked at a
    lot  of fonts trying to find out what it is. The lowercase 't' seems more unusual
    in other serif faces that I've looked at.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be a fairly
    new typeface - but then I'm not good at spotting anything but the glaringly obvious
    with fonts - anyway that's why I put it up on this forum. I felt someone here
    would recognise it.\r\n\r\nHere's a shot of a cover:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPete[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weekend_mag_6502.jpg]"

    would beg to differ: top of t, serifs and contrast are different, for example."

    finer and the terminals on the top of the 't' and 'u' for example are curved,
    but are not curved on Georgia.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nPete"
