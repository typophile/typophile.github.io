To the best of my recollection, Hrant (whether one agrees with him or disagrees with him) has never resorted to name-calling (&quot;complete jerk&quot;) to make his point. <BR> <BR>Further, he is willing to put his opinion out there and sign his name to it. While this is not (and should not be) a requirement of this forum, this fact added to his civility does lend a certain degree of credibility to his posts and method of argument. <BR> <BR>At very least, it adds to my respect for him (and others with a similar degree of civility), whether I agree with or disagree with the point he happens to be making. <BR> <BR>David</div>

I personally think anonymous posting should be allowed (for reasons that Jared articulated), but clearly anonymous *attacks* (or worse yet, anonymous defamation campaigns) can cause severe damage to Typophile itself. From my experience, certain people have no qualms about trying to bring down an entire channel of discussion/communication if it happens not to be going their way; sabotage is justified for them simply because it serves their self-righteous (and very selfish) ideals. <BR> <BR>Logistically, there are no obvious/trivial solutions, but I'm not worried that the Typophile boys will do what's needed, when it's needed - which might [justifiably] include nipping this problem in the bud. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Therefore Hrant's use of that figure as being incorrect would appear to have a high bogosity factor: <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&quot;20 is an order of magnitude closer to the truth than 600&quot; <BR> <BR> <BR>References to 300: <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&quot;I'd say that the type business supports around 3-400 people world wide on a full time basis, excluding those working in retail sales which probably comes to around another couple of hundred.&quot; <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&quot;BTW, forget thousands: if it is/were even close to 300, I'd be happy.&quot; <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&quot;However they choose to go with the flow of work as it comes and goes. I do believe that there is enough work to keep 300+ people working full time, but as i wrote before, that's a subset of a group that's quite a bit larger.&quot; <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&quot;But 300 is completely lala-land.&quot; <BR> <BR> <BR>Conclusion: Clive seems non-specific if these 300 are &quot;type designers&quot;, so difficult to argue that his figure is wrong, though Erik's post indicates having read this and chooses not to counter it - in fact agreeing with the wider 600 figure. <BR> <BR>Given that many people have given numbers far inexcess of 20, or around 20 for just 1 little country (how can there be that many just in England and not a &quot;magnitude&quot; greater than that worldwide!?). <BR> <BR>Hrant still insists there are ~20. <BR> <BR>I think I would tend to side with someone like Erik Spiekermann, who clearly has a better understanding than most - being a type designer himself and having run a large foundry/reseller. <BR> <BR>So, there are the tatters: your point seems to be proved wrong at worst and rhetoric at best.</div>

If you need help understanding what that means, ask, or look up some words. <BR> <BR>Yes, I *was* wrong back when I wrote that there are &quot;way less than 20&quot;. I'm willing (and possibly unlike you *able*) to learn, and I've found that going out on a limb is a great strategy in this respect (because too often people who have valuable information will only reveal it in some form of self-defense), as long as you can take the occasional slip (which I can). The problem is that some people here are not interested in learning, just yelling. <BR> <BR>If we must focus on 20/600, I can safely say: <BR>I was much less wrong than *you* still are now! <BR> <BR>&gt; I think I would tend to side with someone like Erik Spiekermann <BR> <BR>I learned a lot from Spiekermann's post. And actually much of what he wrote (not the little snippets you wasted your time compiling, like some hapless lawyer, but the *good* stuff which is *always* between in lines) gave me more confidence that 600 was way off (again, remember: using my definition). I side with nobody, except what makes *sense*; no single person is omniscient, and certainly not 100% objective. If you could be just over 50% objective, you might get my point.

I would suppose that some come here to learn, and to get information. At the same time there are fools like Papazian spreading myth and rumor in the name of truth (Rev P King anyone?), and then others follow-up essentially stating that it's wrong to point out what a fool he is. <BR> <BR>The method used may be long-winded and out of place here, but the truth is clear, Papazian's continued nonsense-speak just muddies the water for everyone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">not to toot my own horn, but i've made a living purely on type design for the past three years - no freelance. the secret is to cut out the middleman and be your own foundry - i make 87% off each sale rather than 20-40% that other foundrys offer. i admit i'm in a niche market, but i net around $300 a day.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well &hellip; <BR>all of the comments I read here are interesting, some amusing, some not so. Erik Spiekermann's comments were obviously the most informed. Just my 2 cents, I think it about as likely to make a decent living these days from type design as it is from graphic design in general. The true &quot;democritization&quot; of design has happened, i.e., everyone with a computer is a designer. This subject has been touched upon by some in other venues. There can't be more than a very small number, 600 ? someone said, perhaps Erik, worldwide who make a living designing type fonts. But, I still do this stuff when I can and enjoy it.  <BR>Jordan</div>
