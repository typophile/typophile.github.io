    piece/glyph/component/character... or?

    \xABmirrored\xBB one you show is the more common/classic variant. The one with
    two handles on one dagger seems more elegant to me, but mostly I prefer it because
    it makes for a nicely intuitive/\xABreadable\xBB sequence, in terms of the overall
    shape not changing so much, save for gaining handles.  :-)"

    we need a Unicode point for the triple dagger! :-)"

  body: "What I was trying to say is, I think a solution such as the one I posted
    above makes it more likely that all 3 of them are perceived as permutations of
    the same thing \u2013 as a linear/additive sequence of what are essentially daggers.
    The one you posted has a nice contrast between #1 and #2 (where the \xABdoubling\xBB
    is quite obvious), but between #2 and #3 the overall shape changes so much that
    it could almost be another character altogether (especially at the tiny sizes
    that this thing is going to be used in). Dunno.\r\nOn the other hand, yours nicely
    works the middle ground between the dagger and the asterisk! :-)"
