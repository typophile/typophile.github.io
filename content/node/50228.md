    every type clip so far\u2026 Cooper Black, both Trajan things, the Font-Dating
    website, the superb Font Conference\u2026 this just doesn't hold up :( I find
    it neither funny nor clever. Maybe it is made for total non-type geeks, but so
    was Font Conference, and that had me in stitches\u2026 "

  body: Sorry, I got carried away by my distaste, and didn't click on the link to
    your review, just on the video itself. Oh well, I found your review, thanks to
    your reminder. Well said.

    qualities if the storyline had been stronger.

    your comment got caught by the Wordpress spam filter. This was just what happened
    to my original comment back on your FontFeed blog. I merely posted again without
    the URL. \r\n\r\nThanks to all who spotted the rendering error - you've got good
    eyes! We've updated the trailer on our site to the final version: http://www.suitcasefusion2.com/preview.html\r\n"
