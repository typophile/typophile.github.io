body: My Wife was wanting a journal at Barns And Noble, She picked out one that had
  the alphabet on the cover, but wasn't going to get it because she said "If it had
  a bad typeface I'de be pissed" haha. So she asked, "s this a good typeface?" I said,
  "yeah its Avant Garde." "So its good?" "Yeah its fine, sweetie." thats my story
  and I'm sticking to it.
