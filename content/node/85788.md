  body: "Luna Lovegood?\r\nI googled that, expecting a Bond femme excelling in the
    oral arts, but found \u2026 Harry Potter.\r\nWhat was JK thinking?!\r\n\r\nAt
    any rate, the face is outrageous, although the serif on \"e\" breaks the spell
    for me."

  body: "Although I like radical experiments, I generally stick to the internal \"rules\"
    of a typeface, rather than make exceptions for the sake of appearance. But your
    premise, that only the \"o\" be unserifed, is also quite logical.\r\n"
