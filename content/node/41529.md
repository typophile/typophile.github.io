body: "<a href=\"http://www.logorip.com/condolences.asp?id=76\">This</a> is a great
  logo. There seems to be some doubt about whether it was an original concept by David
  Gentleman or whether the Security Pacific Bank logo by Saul Bass was an influence.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  does anyone have a construction drawing for it?"

  body: Thanks for the link, but I'm talking about a drawing from the original id
    manual that is based on a square grid with circles of a particular circumference
    etc. I've seen one like it but it was years ago. Nobody ditches great identity
    manuals though. Do they?
