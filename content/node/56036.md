  for a non-profit in New York City.  The targeted audience is both seasoned cyclists
  and those contemplating shifting modes to cycling as a form of commuting.\r\n\r\nIt
  shouldn't be too esoteric (ie. not using bike parts that only real bike fanatics
  will be able to read).  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal of the campaign is to highlight
  both safe cycling as well as the upside of biking.  \r\n\r\nThe logo should be friendly,
  inviting and slightly playful.\r\n\r\nWe've been though a million iterations and
  the consensus has been to follow in the direction attached below.  If anyone has
  any suggestions for further font, color or layout directions, it would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: it says extreme biking to me...with the scratch marks & the type face...quite
    opposite of what you intended.

  body: Looks nice in and of itself, but I completely agree with Jake. It has nothing
    to do with the target audience or campaign goal. Good luck.

  body: I agree with both other postings. You have accomplished exactly what you didn't
    want to do. While your design is stylistically attractive, it looks geared for
    the extreme mountain biker, not a seasoned NYC cyclist nor someone new to biking
    as an alternative means of transportation. It does not say "safe cycling". Step
    back from it for a little bit and look at it with fresh eyes. I understand you've
    been through tons of versions already but ask yourself the question Does this
    logo really say what we want it to say, or does it just look cool?

- body: "It seems to me your target market - those most likely to consider cycling
    to work - are the environmental greenies. You know, the type that believes if
    we all rode bikes instead of cars, it would bring about world peace AND bring
    John Lennon back to life?  To that end, if I were you, I'd go walk through Whole
    Foods and look at logos. This logo is more grungy dirt biker than enlightened
    urban hippie.\r\n\r\nOf course I could be characterizing your target market entirely
    wrong?\r\n\r\nAlso, at first glance, the ring immediately evoked a steering wheel
    on a sports car; and, don't tell anyone, but I consider myself and enlightened
    urban hippie...\r\n\r\nOne more idea; have you considered an \"alternative to
    a taxi\" concept? Perhaps a campaign built around why bikes are better than taxis?"

  body: I agree with what everyone else is saying, but I don't think you have to totally
    scrap it and go "back to the drawing board". You could simply work on making this
    concept look more "enlightened urban hippie" than "grungy dirt biker" as Alaskan
    put it. Changing the texture and the colours could give it a completely different
    feel.

  body: Due to many issues, it looks like we are actually going to outsource this
    project.  Does anyone have suggestions for good NYC based logo designers?
