body: Does any one know what the copyright implications are of adapting a font. So
  it looks very similar to the original but has been adapted by hand...

  body: "Since fonts are licensed software, each foundry has their own agreement.
    This is often referred to as a EULA\u2014meaning end users license agreement.
    Most will allow you to alter letters for a given project such as logo. I'm not
    sure exactly what you mean by adapting. Some will allow personalizing a version
    of a font for your own use, but I doubt you would find any that would allow you
    to moderate the outlines a bit and then resell it as your own. "

  body: I believe you need to make an important semantic distinction as to whether
    you are talking about making changes to a font or a typeface. I'm not sure about
    the UK, and may be wrong about my belief of US copyright law too, but I think
    there is very little protection for typefaces, but considerable copyright protection
    for fonts.

  body: "There's also a difference between opening up a font in a font editor and
    making changes \"by hand\" - and drawing a font from scratch \"by hand\". Beyond
    that using a trademarked name, redistributing the font etc., all raise legal and
    ethical issues. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you could explain exactly what you're planning
    to do and the peanut gallery can weigh in and pass judgment.\r\n"

    it recently went up from 50 to 70 years ... as it is governed by international
    conventions it\u2019s pretty similar everywhere. See this for UK:\r\nhttp://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-duration/c-types.htm\r\n\r\n"
