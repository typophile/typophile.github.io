  the different Arabic scripts, i\u2019m having a hard time finding good images of
  the different scripts and was wondering if maybe someone here on typohile could
  help me out with some good quality images of the different scripts:\r\n\r\n- Kufi
  and ornament Kufi\r\n- Naskh\r\n- Thuluth\r\n- Diwani\r\n- Taliq\r\n- Farsi\r\n-
  Ruqaa\r\n- Perzisch script\r\n- Maghrebi\r\n\r\ni\u2019m not asking for annyone
  to do all the work for me, its just that i\u2019m absolutely no specialist in separating
  all the different scripts from one another, and i obviously don\u2019t want to guess.
  i did find some images on the net but most of them are of poor quality. i checked
  the academie's library but there is absolutely nothing about this subject,  of course
  i will mention the source of the images in my essay and be glad to send a copy.\r\n\r\ni
  would really appreciate all the help.\r\n"

    : reflections on the state of the art.</em> This is the best guide I have found
    to the different styles, demonstrating each with the same phrase for easy comparison.
    The book also shows a number of rare styles, and explains how they differ from
    related styles.\r\n\r\nMr Zakariya also contributed a 'compendium of Arabic scripts'
    to Nabil Safwat's <em>The art of the pen</em> (see Appendix II). This includes
    an informative showing of paired scripts at different sizes, showing how they
    are related but how each is appropriate to a particular size of writing."

    & Electronics) Mohamed Zakarya also created a series of original examples to correct
    the usual uninformed cliches when he reviewed a book about Arabic typography.
