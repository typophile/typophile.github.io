  into account here &#40;i.e., don&#39;t kill me.&#41;  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Any comments? My main problem is the spacing ... the face
  is really screwy that way and for this sample I manually kerned the heck out of
  it. The face is meant to be idiosyncratic, but I realize that some characters are
  much heavier than others, while some are too light.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10555.gif"
