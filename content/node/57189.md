  some (affordable) type suggestions. I find that since I am doing it myself, I am
  overwhelmed by the abundant options for typefaces out there. I am designing the
  invitation with an nod to art nouveau - I am using an art nouveau-inspired peacock
  graphic that I have done myself - but I do not necessarily want a literal art nouveau
  font. Sorry I don't have a picture of the graphic, it's not available on the computer
  I'm currently on.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Without seeing the peacock or knowing you personally it's going to be difficult
    to suggest suitable fonts. Maybe have a scan through MyFonts with keywords you
    like? Like 19th century or art nouveau. Or go for a particular mood?
