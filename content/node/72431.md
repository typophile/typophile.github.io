  The original designer is long gone and they don't have any other information to
  give.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hotel Logo 2010_5237.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  could use help identifying the \"Viscount Suite\" font as well as the \"Hotel\"
  font (though I realize that one could be a lot of things.) Thanks in advance."
