body: "Over at Microsoft's font blog [1] they discuss published reading speeds for
  various line widths and line spacings. The numbers are pretty clear: it's best to
  read 10pt/12pt text with a width of 3.2 inches, closely followed by the same at
  2.3 inches. In order to get a better feel for the numbers, I made a document with
  actual typeset examples of the layouts discussed (linked from some comments I had
  [2]).\r\n\r\n[1]: http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/default.aspx\r\n\r\n[2]: http://willwont.blogspot.com/2006/05/linewidth-vs-linespacing-examples.html\r\n\r\n(
  Side note. 3.2 inches seems awfully narrow compared with that seen in academia!
  Some of the papers I read are hideous: documents with 11pt Times on A4 paper with
  one inch margins. On the other hand, most are two-column, which makes for annoying
  screen reading, but much easier reading overall.  )\r\n\r\nAnyway, how do these
  numbers correspond to what you use in practise? Do we mostly \"do the right thing\"
  without needing such quantitative evidence? Would anyone dispute the results given?"

    Garamond looks quite a bit different compared to Stone. Larger x-height needs
    more lead."

  body: Bringhurst says that line length should not exceed 2.5 lower case alphabets
    of whatever face you are working with, or usually 60 to 75 characters. I have
    heard of some people who will accept a line length of 90 characters, but imho
    that is pushing it. I am not a fan of setting solid type, and will usually add
    sufficient leading to improve legibility, although there are times when equal
    point sizes for both can look pleasing. Its all relative to what goals you have
    with your design.

  body: "In regards to line length, legibility can also be determined by the number
    of words in the line, with optimum legibility occuring at around 10-12 words per
    line (or 60-70 characters).\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer's The visible word is a good
    source for legibility related research, may be hard to find though."

  body: The old studies showed 65 characters per line to be the optimum reading length,
    (which should always be considerd in letters, not picas inches or words)... The
    monkey wrenches in this are somewhat numerous. I didn't think html or email programs
    allow line spacing, do they? Without justification or hyphenation, forget 1/2
    of everything that works with those things. Also, in screen fonts, people are
    commissioning huge x-hts, like 12 pt on a 10 pt em, and this is skewin' things
    on screens. The other brand of wrench is what the raterizer does with fractions
    of Y pixels. In light of what they do with fractional X pixels, refined screen
    composition has moved out in the mist with the gorillas

    I also think that true immersive reading has yet to\r\nbe properly measured, partly
    because it's really very hard to do,\r\nbut also because the contemporary Science
    scene is not wise enough.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you might only find it in the laboratory while studying immersive reading.
