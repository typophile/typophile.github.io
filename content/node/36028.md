  Would, again, very much appreciate your help IDing it. Thanks once more! :-)\r\n\r\n(I'm
  crossposting this from MyFont's WhatTheFont; since no luck there so far, thought

    is in the ball park as well. The thing about these constructed 80s display faces
    is that they were drawn by hand, and pretty easy to do. So this one could be exactly
    that -- drawn by hand.'

    Gothic</a> has the chamfered corners too (I think that's the term), in the 'lower
    case' characters. You'd only need to add the E crossbar extension, and squoosh
    a little.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<cite> > With only two glyphs it\u2019s hard to ID.</cite>\r\n\r\nMy source
    sample did actually also include the \"X\" (which is in the style of that from
    for ex. Industria, i.e. straight bars, and which in turn does rule out some of
    the referred options), yet, as that letter in particular had too much background
    \"noise\" which I wasn't able to \"clean out\", thus I opted for not including
    it in the uploaded image; I'm sorry for not having referenced it at least, my
    bad. :-S\r\n\r\n<cite> > The thing about these constructed 80s display faces is
    that they were drawn by hand</cite>\r\n\r\nI see... (And yes, this is in fact
    a sample from the 80's. Sorry again, for having failed to mention also this detail;
    I do usually do, when the sample isn't too recent, but somehow missed it in this
    thread... :-S) Maybe it is indeed the case here, too, then, who knows...\r\n\r\nThank
    you, still, to everyone, for all referenced alternatives/hints; much appreciated.
