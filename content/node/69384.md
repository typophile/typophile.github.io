body: "Type 3.0 OpenType font editor has recently been released.\r\n\r\nMajor new
  features include:\r\n- OpenType layout features (eg simple to add ligatures - make
  sure the correctly named glyphs are present, then tick the 'standard ligatures'
  box).\r\n- User-defined Actions that can be run over ranges of glyphs to perform
  transformations etc.\r\n- User-defined composite glyph creation (an example file
  is included that will generate the Greek Extented unicode block).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.cr8software.net/type.html]]\r\n\r\nFor
  Windows 7, XP, 2000 & 98 (ps there are no plans for a Mac version).\r\n\r\nAllan

    If I have to pick between Windows or Fontlab for Mac, Fontlab wins."

    3.0 looks quite interesting, and I'll probably test it when I have some time."

  body: "I did start porting it to Mac a couple of years ago (version 2.0 I think),
    but turned out to be a much larger task than I first imagined - would be twice
    as large now... so Windows only.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAllan"
