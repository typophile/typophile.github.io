    the closest I can match is Franklin Gothic Condensed\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    similarities in TorinoItalicBold.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TorinoItalicBold_4155.jpg]\r\nThere
    may be something closer, or the label could have been created by creative editing
    in the photo composition era."

  body: "Kursiveschrift Liegend [LT] has an approximation of R, g, u and n but is
    too wide. There are several fonts with only the R and g: Torino Italic Bold, ITC
    Century, Century Nova, Madison Antiqua and Modern No. 20 [BT]. Widths and weights
    vary. I have not found any fonts with matching l and i that also have matching
    R, g, u and n. \r\nPerhaps you will have to clip and paste from several fonts
    and adjust widths and weights to make the word.\r\nBTW, Identifont was not helpful
    in finding anything similar to Kursiveschrift Liegend\r\nDon"
