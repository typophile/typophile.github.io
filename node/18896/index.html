  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m working on a typeface at the moment that uses plenty of ligatures (in the style of <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=150&subpage=viewfontsinuse">Ed Interlock</a>) and I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s any way to make certain ligatures be dominant over others? For example, for SHI I have an SH ligature and a HI ligature, and because SH comes first as you&rsquo;re typing, it turns into the ligature and the I is left alone. Without having to make an SHI ligature, can I make the HI ligature dominant over SH in the case of SHI?</p>
<p>And pardon me if that makes no sense at all. I&rsquo;m just curious if I can make certain ligatures bow down to more dominant ones.. If there&rsquo;s any code or such.</p>
<p>Also, while I&rsquo;m here and asking, can you include spacebar in ligature replacements? Say, for example, you have an S and when it&rsquo;s at the end of a word (marked by a spacebar following the S) you want it to do a swashy thing, is that possibe? like a &ldquo;sub S [SPACE] by SSpace.li&rdquo; thing..?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>i remember a gif showing it, but cant find it anymore. this image is a bit of a preview, as you see the glyphs change.</p>
<p>i cant tell you how to do it, but its possible for sure.</p>

<p>the rule is what is first trumps what comes after. this is true of single lookups or of features. do you have the SH ligature lookup in any other feature lookups before you get to the HI ligature lookup?</p>

<p>naming: name a ligature of X &amp; Y X_Y;
put longer ligatures first so quads, triples and then doubles.
if you have no preference of order, alphabetise ligatures just for easy (human) referencing</p>
<p>do you recompile your OT features after adding new lookups to test how they&rsquo;re working? you need to do this each time you change your code before you preview.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Alphabetic ordering is for your own convenience. Ordering ligatures by length in descending order, however, is a generic rule. If f_f ligature would be in the list before f_f_i, latter one would never be substituted.</p>
<p>But ordering does not solve your problem of prioritization. If your lookup contains ligatures A_B and B_C, whatever goes first in the list &ndash; &ldquo;A B C&rdquo; will be substituted to &ldquo;A_B C&rdquo;. To allow B_C to work over A_B two separate lookups are required (or contextual substitutions, which seem to be overkill here).</p>
<p>In VOLT you create two lookups and put ligatures into them according to their priority. FDK also allows to specify separate lookup for the feauture, but I am not sure if it won&rsquo;t compile them into subtables of a single lookup. Syntax would look like this:</p>
<code>
<dl>feature liga {
<dt>lookup liga.Pri1 {</dt>
    <dd>sub B C by B_C</dd>
<dt>} liga.Pri1;</dt>
<dt>lookup liga.Pri2 {</dt>
    <dd>sub A B by A_B</dd>
<dt>} liga.Pri2;</dt>
</dl>} liga;

<p>Chris is right, but you have to tell it what is getting substituted in the string by adding ' after. Get an OpenType font and open it in FontLab and look at the code. That&rsquo;s the easiest way to figure it out.</p>

lookup liga.Pri2 {

<p>If you Type A B first I doubt the B C sub will work. The lookup for A B will kick in before you get to B C and if you don&rsquo;t have a sub for A B C you don&rsquo;t change anything. You should start with the sub of the long (complete) string first.  I think it should be:</p>
<p>feature liga {
lookup liga.Pri1 {
sub A B' C' by A B_C
sub A B by A_B
} liga.Pri1;
} liga;</p>
<p>Once the B C sub is done the following A B sub won&rsquo;t change it since it&rsquo;s now A B_C, not A B C. It&rsquo;s the same as the f ligatures, f_f_i comes first, then f_i and f_f.</p>
<p>At least this is my understanding of how the GSUB works.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do many-to-many substitutions in OpenType. So if your input is multiple glyphs, then the output has to be a single glyph (i.e. a ligature lookup).</p>
<p>Regarding ligature names, you should definitely use the underscore notation, so H_I, not HI.li</p>
<p>A period . indicates that the glyph is a variant of a glyph, e.g. a.alt is an alternate form of a. But there is not HI glyph for HI.li to be a variant of.</p>
<p>The underscore _ notation is parseable by an application that implements the Adobe glyph naming rules.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No. Processing is going like this:
<code>
For each lookup
For each position where lookup is applied,
For each &lsquo;rule&rsquo; in the lookup.
If rule matches the context do what it says, move to the next position
If rule does not match the context, try next rule.
</code></p>
<p>So lookup order has higher priority than position.</p>
<p>About your approach, it won&rsquo;t work because &lsquo;position&rsquo; in your contextual substitution starts from B' (A is just backtrack context). So A_B will work first according to the algorithm above.</p>
<p>It also misses another entry for B_C ligature, without context. And this example contains only two ligatures, in the real font more contexts may be needed for ligatures conflicting with B_C &ndash; looks like supportability case for me. Adding one ligature may cause changing everything around.</p>

<p>still, you should name your ligature H_I or H_I.li or H_I.liga, but <em>not</em> HI.li. It does matter. Please read the FontLab Studio 5 manual for extensive glyph naming suggestions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i just thought i&rsquo;d let you all know that i tested the use of seperate lookup groups, and it gives me just the effect i was looking for. if i place the H_I ligature in the top group and have the S_H ligature in the one below it&rsquo;ll override the S_H ligature and go to the H_I ligature even when writing SHI.</p>
<p>so thanks again everyone who helped out! it&rsquo;s much appreciated.</p>
<p>by the way, why isn&rsquo;t there some resource with examples of various effects one can achieve with Opentype? i had an idea about having the upper and lowercase alternate (LiKe So AnD sO oN, though i&rsquo;d use it as a sort of randomizer), and i actually figured out how to achieve it eventually.. but it&rsquo;s stuff like that you&rsquo;d wish there was some website resource for where people could send in their tricks and tips. too bad, really. very little about Opentype out there it seems, or everyone&rsquo;s sitting on their own coding and not wanting to share.. maybe? or wanting money for it, perhaps..</p>

<p>Your best source is workshops at the conferences like SOTA and ATypI. People are happy to show you how to do stuff. Nick Shinn did one on stylistic alternates in a script font and Thomas Phinney has demoed some amazing stuff with relatively easy code including random things. He also has an OT font that replaces profanity in text.</p>

<p>I remember it well. I was surely joking (which is most of the time in my case). My Greek vocabulary is very limited and I would be the last person to point shame at anyone else. I really did enjoy your presentation and your &ldquo;paralized with fear&rdquo; part did not show.</p>
<p>BTW, I just attended a Fontech session in NYC at TDC where Thomas Phinney was one of the presenters.  He was bragging on you and showing your work to some of the attendees who had not seen it. Your many hours in graduate school did not go in vein!</p>
