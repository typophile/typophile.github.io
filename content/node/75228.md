body: "This question may best be directed at Adam, but any other comments are definitely
  welcome.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project whereby I need to develop up to 10 different
  styles of the same font. When I finish one font, I do a save as and begin work on
  the next one, and so on. \r\n\r\nI work on a Mac using OSX 10.5.8\r\n\r\nThe problem
  I'm having is with Generating the fonts because if I simply do a SAVE AS of the
  font, the Font ID (for Mac, especially) numbers remain the same as the original.
  \r\n\r\nWith  FOG4 I had the option of changing the PostScript and BitMap ID numbers
  so there wouldn't be an ID conflict. I'm having a problem doing the same thing in
  FOG5 because I don't see anywhere I can make the ID number changes.\r\n\r\nIf I
  try to open the fonts in FOG 4 (because I know I CAN make the changes in it), I
  am getting crashes. So, my question is: Is it possible to change the font ID numbers
  in FOG 6?\r\n\r\nAnother work around is to generate the first font, then open its
  PS file and create a NEW font from it by doing a save and naming it with the next
  style name.  I've tried that, and went into FOG4 to make sure the ID numbers were
  different. When I tried to do a GET INFO for the file FOG4 crashes. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help, or explanation would be appreciated. Please keep it fairly non-technical though,
  as I'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to such technical matters.Thanks\r\n\r\nRob"

  body: "Apple has been ignoring the FOND ID* since MacOS 8 (1997). \r\n\r\nActually,
    FOND ID is still being used when Mac OS X installs a Mac Type 1 font, but only
    for the purpose of identifying which codepage the font should be reconigzed at
    (MacRoman, MacCE, MacCyrillic etc.). But the FOND IDs no longer need to be unique,
    so I wouldn't worry about it at all. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
