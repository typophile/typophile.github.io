  found that large PostScript T1 families (in this case 12 fonts or more) will cause\r\nsome
  styles to show up and others disappear. And sometimes the reverse,\r\nor sometimes
  somewhere in between the two.\r\n\r\nThis is OS9. \r\nMaybe both FR and OS9 will
  quietly vanish from the earth..."

    not touching OS9 and certainly not Font Reserve.\r\nThis question pertains to
    a customer inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn the hopes of figuring this out, I dowloaded the
    FR demo\r\nfrom Extensis and it turned all of my system menu and application fonts\r\nto
    Helevetica. And wouldn't switch them back...\r\nSounds like a grad student fantasy
    of some sort."

    Sure it's underpowered and a little dodgy on hills, but you can keep 'er running
    because the thing is so darned *simple*. \r\n\r\nMany software vendors can't support
    OS 9 simply because there are now few clients running said OS. However, if stuff
    was working at the point when the main user base left the building, there's no
    reason why it wouldn't continue to chug along.  FR 3.1.3 ran on OS 9.  However,
    it sounds like it f'd up the WYSIWYG menu add-on software. Unfortunately, you're
    sort of stuck between using the ancient installer and the updated (and probably
    last OS 9) version, which was probably only tested on stock systems. \r\n\r\nAldus
