  body: The class names are arbitrary unless you have identical ones. If you start
    messing around with the order it can cause FontLab's autonaming to generate class
    names which already exist. If you have to remove a class, make sure you replace
    it, so the order isn't thrown off. Otherwise, years later, you might open the
    font, generate a new class and end up with a duplicate class name. I usually do
    caps, lowercase, misc, period, hyphen, quote. If you want to manually name your
    classes, knock yourself out but I stick with the autonames.

    I know this is not quite the answer you were looking for but I promise you will
    never look back after giving it a try:\r\n\r\nhttp://tools.typesupply.com/metricsmachine.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Autonaming: When you add a new kerning class in Fontlab it automatically
    names them _kern1, _kern2 etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing the point of the question.
    I never found the need to organize kern classes in a particular way. I just make
    them and, well, there they are. Do you mean how do you decide what's contained
    in each one of those kern classes? I don't get it."

    about is a good way to organize glyphs in classes: e.g. figure out which classes
    you need."

  body: "Figuring out the classes is a matter of your eye, and so a matter of your
    decision as the designer. Which glyphs should be kerned the same on that side
    of the glyph? Should the D and the O be kerned the same on the right side or not?
    Depends on the design.\r\n\r\nI never used FontLab, but went right to Metrics
    Machine. Even Yuri, chief programmer for FontLab, has recommended it highly here
    on Typophile.  "

    you all organize your kerning classes. "

  body: "Frode, I guess I didn't understand because in Metrics Machine the classes
    are already organized as you set them up. Here is what the Metrics Machine Kerning
    Groups window looks like--or did, because it is probably improved in the current
    version:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MetricsMachineKerningGroupsWindow_4825.gif]"

  body: "I just start with A, add all the A accents.\r\nC, then all the C accents.\r\nand
    so on.\r\n\r\nSometimes an O can be a parent to a Q. Sometimes o can be a parent
    to e and in rare cases, c. If it looks like it might work, add it to the class.
    If it's not working out, take it back out of the class. You can add and remove
    stuff while you're kerning. Copy and paste special can save some time when you
    boot something out.\r\n\r\nI usually don't make add lowercase i accents to the
    i class. Sometimes it works out that lowercase i gets no kerning but you might
    choose to kern dotless i on its own. Lowercase i accent collisions can be dealt
    with beforehand with spacing adjustments.\r\n\r\nUsually period, comma, ellipsis
    and base quotes can safely go together.\r\nI usually make the straight single
    quote the part of all other quotes unless they've got a steep angle.\r\nUsually
    hyphen can be the parent of emdash and endash. You can try make guillemots children
    of the hyphen but it often doesn't work out . . . but sometimes. Give it a shot.\r\n\r\nFor
    stuff like AE OE, I just copy/paste special the left kerning as a last step. Yeah,
    I waste a few kerns by not defining left/right classes but that time can be better
    spent improving something else and it's less prone to errors (for me). The end
    result is the same anyway.\r\n\r\nWatch out for Lslash, Ldot, Lcaron, tbar and
    Tbar. You're better off leaving those out of the classes than including them."

    place a new class at the bottom instead of where the cursor is.

    figures being thrown in with glyphs which is rarely a good thing. I don't use
    it anymore.

  body: "\"Have you tried Generate Classes from the Classes panel?\"\r\n\r\nYes, but
    as James says, never again. I also learned to avoid automatically generated anything.
    \r\nAlso, once you have your classes, be sure to save the class file. They not
    only are usable as a backup when you accidently click the show only class button
    and they fly away, but you can import that file into other similar fonts you are
    working on as a start point."
