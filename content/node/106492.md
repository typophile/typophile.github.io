  guys I've been working on this custom lettering project. What do you guys think?
  Is the composition balanced? Is this too busy? Your suggestions & constructive criticism
  would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nIt's inspired by this quote... \"Wealth is of
  the heart and mind, not the pocket\" by Pharrell.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n- Joseph\r\nwww.josephle.net\r\n\r\n"

  body: The one thing I wonder is why the crossbar of the t doesn't go through (or
    maybe I should say over and under) like the crossbar of the H. For the rest of
    your question, I'm not really qualified to comment.
