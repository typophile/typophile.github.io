  body: "Ujrail,\r\n\r\nThis is called \"working on speculation\" and is considered
    by many to be highly irresponsible, unprofessional and even disrespectful to the
    practice. It takes advantage of young designers trying to enter the field and
    devalues what we do as professionals. If you want a quality product, find the
    right person for the job, and pay them their fee. As you would a doctor or lawyer.\r\n\r\nI
    cannot speak for others, and I do not fully understand what social media \"strategy\"
    is, but from my experience here, I do not think this is the place one goes to
    create a profile to announce logo contests and hope to get a good deal. On top
    of that, I am fairly certain isn't the place to advertise your new robot company.\r\n\r\nYou
    will however find hundreds, if not thousands or people with a very keen and diverse
    set of interests around the field of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography\">typography</a>
    who will be more than willing to provide you with advice, consultation &c which
    may even lead to a lasting professional relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more reading

    many professional design association such as <a href =\"http://www.rgdontario.com/\">The
    Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aiga.org/\">American
    Institute of Graphic Arts</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.gdc.net/\">Graphic
    Designers of Canada</a> will have job posting boards and resources to help you
    find the right client for the job."

    about Christorpher's comments.. If someone wins, he or she may be hired too, but
    it's all about choice of person whether he enters the contest or not!\r\n\r\nI
    just wanted to convey the contest deadline has been extended. Anybody willing

  body: "\"<em>If someone wins, he or she may be hired too</em>\u2026\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    even more manipulative that asking someone to work on spec. Not to mention shamelessly
    bumping your own post.\r\n\r\nAsk any freelance designer how many times they have
    heard a client say \"I know the budget for this job is small, but if it goes over
    well, there <em>may</em> be lots more work for you in the future!\"\r\n\r\nI suggest
    making a <a href =\"http://www.facebook.com/\">facebook</a> page for this."

  body: "I agree with Christopher. It's one thing for a charity or non-profit to ask
    for spec work, but this sounds like a profit-making company that just doesn't
    want to pay professional wages.\r\n\r\nI doubt if they'd ask a bunch of accountants
    or electricians or plumbers to work under a similar arrangement, but somehow it's
    okay to ask designers to work that way."

    Just come and replumb my bathroom, kitchen and wash room! Winner also gets the
    rare privilege of adding my house to their portfolio". I still haven't gotten
    any takers. :(
