body: I've seen this beautiful typeface in projects designed mostly by designers out
  of England and Australia. I can find poor imitations only. I would LOVE to finally
  add it to my collection. Thanks!

    similar styles are. In yours, the dots do not line up matrix-style, but rather
    like they were hand-punched in order to space the dots very evenly.\r\n\r\nI seem
    to remember questions like this in the past, and I thought someone found a good
    digital version. Maybe someone else here remembers this?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    people who remember this past quest would know to look at your post. Perhaps \"Non-matrix
    dotted font\" or something along those lines? (As the poster who started the thread,
    you can edit the title.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    trying to recall. Letraset Pinball has not been digitized, and it is not exactly
    the same as yours, but it is closer. You might try google searches for it, just
    in case someone decided to digitize it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the comments! Yes, it is the precision of the even spaces that
    really appeals to me. Perhaps I'll go to a bookstore and look at typography books.
    I tried http://www.tineye.com/ which fared better (for other images not included
    here) than a Google search, but still no match. -D.

    Typophile for \"Stella McCartney\" turns up some threads that might have useful
    information. (Her logo uses such letters and has been asked about on the ID forum
    a number of times.)"

    but it has minor problems. It is warning me to proceed with caution. I really
