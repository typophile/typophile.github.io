  just counters or outlines around the characters that aren't enclosed. I got inspired
  to try this after seeing counterless fonts several times, something that may have
  been inspired in turn by an earlier attempt at what I've just done.\r\nSeveral of
  the letters were pretty easy, where there were many curves forming an enclosed or
  nearly enclosed space. The G and the Q gave interesting results, for example.\r\nThe
  S and the rest of the \"straight line\" characters were more challenging. On these
  I just filled out the surrounding space by connecting up points visible from each
  other. \r\n\r\nThis was just for fun, the result is readable with a fair amount
  of effort, but the more I look at it, the more it grows on me.\r\n\r\nHow would
  you handle letters like L, I and J, or W/M, and are there some well-known examples
  using this? This probably falls under use of negative space, but there's more going
  on than just that, I think."
