  body: Well, there is a free font called <a href="http://www.fryfonts.com/free-font/111">The
    Sims</a>, but it may indeed be based on an existing typeface - guys?

  body: Also, the M&#39;s tips dont match up in height - which suggests that it&#39;s
    hand drawn, as well... but that Sims fonts would get you close.  May want to try
    drawing it up yourself.

    used a font called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/newport-land/urw-t-normal/testdrive.html?s=SIMS&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Newport</a>. The current logo seems to have evolved from that.
