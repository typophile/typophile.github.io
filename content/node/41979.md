  out what typeface this image was set in. The book is <cite>Rerum Anglicarum scriptores
  post Bedam praecipui, ex vetustissimis codicibus manuscriptis nunc primum in lucem
  editi</cite>, edited by Sir Henry Savile and published in 1596 (Excudebant G. Bishop,
  R. Nuberie, & R. Barker typographi regij deputati). The image is from <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&res_id=xri:eebo&rft_id=xri:eebo:citation:99857076\">Early
  English Books Online</a>, an academic database, and was scanned from microfilm.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could recommend any resources on early typography, it would also be very
  helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "I could not get your file to open so that  I could see anything. Maybe a
    partial screen shot would work better.\r\n\r\nAs for your question about resources,
    I will mention \"Printing Types -Their History, Forms, and Use\" by Daniel Berkeley
    Updike. Dover reprinted this 1937 book in their 1980 edition. There is a mention
    of Henry Savile obtaining a Greek type bought at Frankfort, called the \"Silver
    Letter\" for the Oxford Press. The reference is confusing, because apparently
    he left it to them after his death. It was intersting to note that in the same
    chapter that mentions Savile, the Fell Types are discussed. These have been digitized
    by Jonathan Hoefler, and are available from H&FJ as [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_inside.php?wipID=16&productLineID=100012|The
    Fell Types]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thank you, Mike, for the suggestions. That book looks like it will be very
    useful indeed. Also, thanks to Florian for re-posting the image; some of the files
    from EEBO can be a bit strange.
