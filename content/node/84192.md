body: "I recently got a Mac, and I'm having trouble rendering opentype Arabic fonts.
  Apple native fonts render OK, and I can write Arabic with Pages, for example. But
  I can't use opentype Arabic fonts, there are no ligatures. So, SIL's Scheherazade
  AAT font works, but the Opentype version does not.\r\n\r\nAnd Arabic opentype fonts
  either render clumsily in PDF in the native PDF viewer (generated with Xelatex).
  The same pdf shows OK when using some external PDF viewer (such as Texworks). (See
  the two attachments). I don't know about Adobe Reader, I thought about installing
  it to see if it could make a difference, but deemed it too bloated (400mb + just
  for a PDF reader), and I don't even know if it will make a difference. \r\n\r\nI
  installed the most recent updates, I'm afraid there was some bug with Opentype fonts
  and PDFs in Leopard, but other opentype fonts are OK.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OS X has always required AAT fonts for complex scripts like Arabic, Devanagari,
    etc.    There are exceptions however.  For example, the app TextEdit should display
    Arabic OpenType fonts correctly, and the app Mellel uses its own text engine specifically
    designed to do the same (but it cannot do Devanagari).\r\n\r\nPages and all iWork
    apps and iWeb have various other bugs that make them generally unsuitable for
    RTL scripts even with AAT fonts.   MS Word for Mac OS X has also never supported
    Arabic with any kind of font.  Adobe apps should be the ME version to work properly.
    Recommended apps for Arabic are Mellel (easily the best), TextEdit, Nisus Writer,
    or Open/Neo/LibreOffice. "
