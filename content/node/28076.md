  body: "No - check out the cross bars on the H, E etc. in the sample they are much
    higher than in Agenda.\r\n\r\nI never noticed before that Fontbureau let you set

  body: I agree with Patty. I couldn't think of the name. Agenda and Bodega sans have
    some of the right traits, but neither are a smoodgy as Oz Handicraft.

    that the designer of Oz Handicraft had released another take on Cooper's lettering.
    But it's not <a href=\"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/original/migrate.htm\">ITC
