  body: "I like the area where the counters are shown, have you tried kerning the
    GDC even closer and then just use the counters? However the ligatured letters
    in Graphic Design Club are not working for me especially the junctions of RAE
    and EU and the redrawn B, they leave more questions than you can answer in the
    logo, for example, why are the PI and EL not joined?\r\nTim"
