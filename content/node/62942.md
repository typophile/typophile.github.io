  body: "Another fan of the Tree! :-D\r\n\r\nI've been trying to find a decent approximation
    of the Deadwing type since the album came out, even though it does appear to be
    hand-drawn. The closest I have found so far is the font \"Crazy Killer\" by The
    Font Emporium / Matt Dennewitz. It's not correct, but is similar.\r\n\r\nYou probably
    already know that Misproject from www.misprintedtype.com was used extensively
    to promote Fear Of A Blank Planet. \r\n-- \r\nDave Ward Photography\r\nhttp://www.DaveWard.net"
