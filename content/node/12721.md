    I've checked out... the posts and replies come fast and furious. If there are
    no comments or replies on a new topic within 24 hours, it could get buried three
    pages deep on the \"Recent Posts\" page.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Nicolai's dingbats,
    they are imaginative, and dare I say, notanic! The rounded forms are almost Aztec/Inca
    in imagery.\r\n\r\nBut I fear our notice of them now is just \"too little, too
    late.\"\r\n"
