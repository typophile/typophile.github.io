body: I'd like to know what typeface was used for the text of the Sun Also Rises.
  (I attach a .jpg of the last page.) I've always liked it. Ring any bells?

    Electra</a>?

    body: I agree. I just typed out the passage using Electra and compared it with
      the book, and the most glaring difference was that question mark, which has
      more flair in the book. Hmm.

    body: 1926, reprinted 1954. I guess the typesetting was done in 1954 becuase 1926
      would predate Electra, if that's what this is.

  body: My bad. Although we weren't far off. I believe this is [[Fairfield]], pre-digital,
    designed by [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]. Ruzicka was inspired/influenced by Dwiggins and
    his work.
