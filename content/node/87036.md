  Boys 1967 album, 'SMiLE'.  Although the full album has only JUST been released (yes!)
  the design was complete in 1967.  I really am curious to know what the font is.
  \ Can any of you kind souls help?\r\n\r\nWhilst I am on the subject, Brian Wilson,
  the main creative force behind the Beach Boys, did completely remake/re-record the
  'SMiLE' material in 2004 for his 'Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE' album.  A similar-ish,
  although by no means identical, font was used for that title.  Does anyone know
  that font?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to any and all help you may be able to provide.
  \ Thanks!\r\n\r\n[[http://brianwilson.com/]]"

    the newer release. The rest of the 2004 lettering is some form of \"animated\"

  body: "oldnick and Ryuk, thanks for your replies!  Good spot with the Daddy-O font
    as part of the 2004 album.\r\n\r\nDisappointing that there is probably no matching
    font for the 1967 titles.  I suppose it is understandable that the original might
    have been hand-drawn, due to the technology of the day, but I just hoped it might
    have actually been a recognised font style.  Oh well ......"

    process. IMHO, at least. '

    point I was making was that, whilst recognising that the SMiLE font was probably
    hand drawn at the time it was created, I wondered/hoped whether it may have subsequently
    been formalised as a stand-alone font, whether that was soon or long after it's
    creation.\r\n\r\n"
