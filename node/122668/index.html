  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I just completed a large document (288 pgs) in In-Design 6 and tried to publish it to PDF.  I know you heard this before.  Adobe refused to embed the font, which of course is mandatory.  The font is a TTF created in 2001.</p>
<p>I have written permission to use the font commercially and need to find a way to legally remove the do-not-embed restriction.  I contacted the creator of the font, and he did not realize he even put in the restriction and does not know how to remove it.  He does not even have the program he used to create the font.  Yikes!</p>
<p>Changing the font would take weeks even though I only use it in chapter heads and drop caps.  I am also afraid outlining would put things out of whack.  It needs to work in print and in multiple electronic forms.</p>
<p>I have scoured the web and have tried all sorts of apps.  Some did not work, and I could not even figure out how to use a few others.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I can get myself out of this fix?  I get addicted to fonts and will resist changing it since it so perfectly relates to the subject matter of the text.</p>
<p>Help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Suzanneski,
You can use a DOS program (windows command line) called embed.exe.
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/0gxvzsocqq6z2gr/embed.rar">http://www.mediafire.com/download/0gxvzsocqq6z2gr/embed.rar</a>
Remember to use this program only with the creator&rsquo;s permission.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sorry to be so late getting back to you all, but I have been swamped, figuratively and literally.  (I live in Louisiana.)</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses.  I tried asking the font creator to fix it.  However, he did not know how to fix it and does not even have a program necessary for the task.  This is the only font he ever created.</p>
<p>Luckily, someone from this group emailed me privately with great info.  Even though he had rescued me with the information I needed, it stressed me because I have become handicapped by Windows and am no longer sure of command line stuff.</p>
<p>This is the really amazing part.  I emailed High-logic, the folks who sell the FontCreator program.  I was so desperate that I was willing to buy the program just for one use, to fix this font.  However I did not have to.  They volunteered to fix the font for me for free so long as I would send them emails from the creator to verify that it was okay with him.  Within hours, the font was mailed back to me, healed.   I am still amazed by the fact that they trashed a chance to make a profit to help a goober.  If I ever decide to add font creation to all my other endeavors, I will certainly deal with them.  I got great customer service without even being a customer.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the responses and help.  My appreciation for humanity has been enhanced by this frustrating situation and caring people.</p>
<p>Happy Mardi Gras.

		<div class="commentbody">Create outline for each page (actually you must for each individual text box) before exporting to pdf. Go to TYPE in the InDesign menu bar and then Create Outline. Make sure you first save a copy without creating outlines (because I don&rsquo;t think you can undo). Then you have made images of your text and you should be able to export the file to pdf. Does this make sense? Best, Anthony</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Anthony, in general converting text to outlines is regarded as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->circumventing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the EULA.</p>
<p>I believe the intention of most EULAs is not to forbid embedding the font <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an sich<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but instead to forbid using the font at all inside a PDF. Therefore, you are violating perhaps not the letter of the EULA, but certainly its spirit.</p>
<p>EULAs tend to lag behind technical possibilities &ndash; that is, if &lsquo;just outline the fonts&rsquo; becomes common practice, it&rsquo;ll surely get mentioned that is allowed/not allowed next time.</p>
