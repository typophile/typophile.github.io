body: What if the J. Crew catalogue still showed all their stone-washed jeans from
  the 80s. You know, just in case someone wanted them. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want my
  last post in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22787.html">Beginning
  a Font Collection</a> thread to leave a negative tone, &#40;it&#39;s the holidays
  for cryin&#39; out loud.&#41; So, I have a recommendation for the shepherds of the
  big, old collections at Bitstream, Linotype, Adobe, ITC, etc. &#40;Nick, you won&#39;t
  mind me piggybacking off your earlier observation?&#41; <BR> <BR><b>1</b> Weed out
  the duds / oldies immediately. &#40;Come on, you know which ones, they match those
  tweed jackets with the elbow patches.&#41; <BR> <BR><b>2</b> In 12 years re-release
  them as a retro pack. You&#39;re just sitting on a gold mine that just has to age
  for a while. In the meantime you&#39;ll be helping keep Hobo off our streets &#40;pun
  fully intended&#41;. <BR> <BR>What foundries already do this? I know the good stock
  photo agencies do. They have to for their own credibility. &#40;Oh, and Getty, if
  you&#39;re listening, Photodisc is ripe for the &#34;archive&#34; bin.&#41;
