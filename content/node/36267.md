  looking for something similar (square or extended, technical looking, but still
  very readable) and I remember being on a website that had loads of good ones like
  this a while ago, but I can't find it again (probably directed there the first time
  round from Pixelsurgeon if that helps). Any font and/or website suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    that it was bespoke. That was just an example of the kind of thing I want - the
    best example I've seen. I'm looking for something so good it could be that one,
    but it's not.\r\n\r\nAnyone know any websites with loads of technical looking
    fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks."
