  with two characters, and thought it might be interesting to show the progression.
  Number 1 is a VERY rough initial sketch \u2013 numbers 2, 3 and 4 show the characters
  starting to resemble something like real letters. Any suggestions for further improvement
  are appreciated. Do you think there's any value in pursuing a full character set
  in this style? \r\n\r\n"

  body: The bottom left part of the bowls seems a bit too fat. Other than that, I
    like the design. It looks very dark; a bit like a blackletter perhaps.
