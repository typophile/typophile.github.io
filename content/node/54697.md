  body: This is quite interesting. Looks quite a bit like Highway Gothic. Closest
    digital version I know of is Interstate, but it's obviously not that.

  body: "I scanned the book cover. I bought this book at the Spui book market in Amsterdam,
    and it's written by Herbert Ihering. Here's from the colophon;\r\n\r\n<em>&copy;
    Rembrandt Verlag Berlin 1959\r\nZweite Auflage 1962\r\nKlischees: Lemke, Graphische
    Kunstanstalt\r\nDruck: Franz Spiller\r\nPrinted in Germany (West-Berlin)</em>\r\n\r\nSo
    I guess that makes it older than Arial! This edition's insides is set in Futura,
    don't know about the first edition.\r\n\r\nThanks for replies, though! Personally,
    I think it's a custom type inspired by the likes of Akzidenz Grotesk and Breite
    Grotesk (thanks Dag Henning)."

    for an obviously german book from probably pre-digital times.\r\n\r\nIn those
    days custom type wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do like it is nowadays.\r\nSo I
    think it\u2019s a font."

  body: haha. I saw that coming. Obviously, it is far older than Highway Gothic, but
    shares some similar forms.
