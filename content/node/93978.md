body: Majority (I think) of the fonts have blunt joins in glyphs, made with two points
  instead of just one vertex. Why is that? Would it be ok in today's standards to
  produce a Opentype font with only (single vertex) sharp joins?

    to prevent the ink <em>inside</em> a sharp edge running in. As your image shows,
    the outside joints are regular (or rather, if the outside joints were blunt as
    well that would be by design only, not as a practical precaution)."

  body: Inside and outside, it can be a good idea to truncate very sharp angles to
    mitigate the exaggerated effect that results when users apply a stroke (I know,
    but it's not like we can stop them doing it).

  body: "Inktraps of course, but they're used in display fonts as well. This got me
    to suspect that there may be also other reasons.\r\n\r\nStrokes - hmm, interesting
    point. But in my case I certainly wouldn't compromise the design of the contours
    for preventing stroke inconsistencies. "

    rasterizing effects (where the displayed glyphs will display unwanted spurs, particularly
    at smaller sizes), although it\u2019s seemed to me an inelegant solution to the
    problem.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: "It provides a more decisive letter shape.\r\nA sharp point is un\uFB01nished,
    in the sense that its exact position is determined by the output device (or size),
    not the type designer, and this will happen differently depending on relative
    sharpness, whereas as a designer one wants a more consistent shape.\r\n"

  body: For *extremely* sharp corners, under some rasterizers, sometimes very bad
    things would happen. Leastways, that's what I got taught at Adobe, and I remember
    seeing the effects a few times, though that was Long Ago.
