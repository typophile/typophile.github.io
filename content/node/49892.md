    on a Mac laptop sitting in front of his Balanese Gamalan instrument! Julian just
    finished a Masters degree in Music Composition and now is working on a Masters
    to PhD in GeoPhysics with a specialty in earthquake science--bang the gong then
    crack up or whatever shakes you :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    from seismic data. It is well beyond my technical expertise. It will be a GeoPhysics
    major but the career path beyond that has several possibilities.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
