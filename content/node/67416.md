  body: "This is an interesting looking font. It would be nice to see a pdf; that
    way we can judge the shapes, contrast and smoothness better. It looks quite well
    crafted. \r\n\r\nAt first glance, it looks like you're not quite decided whether
    this should be narrow or wide. The caps are wide but the lowercase (especially
    e and g) is narrow. I think that could work very interestingly as a concept, but
    then there are still discrepancies like the wide lowercase a or narrow uppercase
    J. \r\n\r\nIt looks like the stems of the uppercase could be a bit heavier.\r\n\r\nComma
    is not in tune with the other glyphs, style-wise. It needs squaring off. The period
    too. Asterisk needs to be monoline I think.\r\n\r\nUphill stroke of X and x needs
    a bit of offset.\r\n\r\nLowercase j should have a flatter tail.\r\n\r\nThe @ sign
    has a bit too much white space. Put the ring nearer the a?\r\n\r\nKeep going,
    this could turn out very interesting!"

  body: "This looks awesome, please finish it.\r\nWhat if the bottom-left corner of
    the lower case b looked like the upper-left corner of g. \r\nI found the terminal
    of lowercase e a little awkward but it could be just me.\r\nMaybe also reduced
    the contrast between the thicks and thins in the uppercase, AXKYN.\r\nIn my opinion
    a close loop P may work better with this typeface (mainly because I don't like
    open loop ones :P) I love the R though.\r\nIt could be that the high contrast
    Uppercase makes the capitals a little thicker than the lowercase at times but
    it's really hard to tell from a PNG.\r\n\r\nBen said:\"At first glance, it looks
    like you're not quite decided whether this should be narrow or wide.\"\r\n\r\nPlease
    don't fix that by making the whole thing narrower."

  body: "Thanks for your positive input guys! \r\n\r\nI've made the lower left corner
    of the lc b like the upper left corner of lc g. I personally don't like it, it
    makes it to much \"fun\" (see \"bibaboerderij\"). Other than that I've made no
    changes yet. \r\n\r\nPlease check out the PDF here: http://www.omashuisje.nl/GERARD31testsheet.pdf!"
