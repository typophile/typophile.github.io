  but when I would save it, I'd save it as \"Test1\" \"Test2\" \"Test1UpperCase\"
  etc....\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever I can not rename the fonts to what I want to call it,
  and I cant rename any of the bolder versions.\r\n\r\nIn Fontbook all versions come
  up as Test1, regular.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how I can manually rename a font and have
  it work throughout the adobe programs and fontbook?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Font Info dialog box in the Names and Copyright tree on the left.\r\n\r\nCheck

    if you use Linotype's free Font Explorer (font management app, better than Fontbook,
    looks like iTunes) it has a menu command for clearing font caches.\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX\r\n\r\nEither
    way, a reboot is necessary to clear the font caches.\r\n\r\nCheers! Good luck\r\nTerrance"
