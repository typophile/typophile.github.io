    just a very broad number of weights with a full character set.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    Multi-Style families?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "\"Super Families\" sounds about right.\r\n(also suggested offline by chester)\r\n\r\nI
    think I can use this - even if it can have two meanings (corresponding multi-style
    families AND/OR large families)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nJacob"

    the word \xBBFamilie\xAB (family): related families form clans or tribes."

  body: "Interesting.\r\n\"Super Family\" and \"Sippe Familie\" even sound alike!\r\n\r\nMaybe
    we could use a third similar word: \"Soup Families\" - meaning font families that
    you can use and mix together with good taste?\r\n(Getting a bit off-track here
    ;-)\r\n\r\nJacob"

  body: '"sippe familie" doesnt make sense at all and doesnt get used after each other
    (just wanted to make sure that nobody uses this in a wrong way).'
