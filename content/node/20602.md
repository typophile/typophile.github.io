  can't find a representative image online, but here goes...\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone
  can give me an exact match for the heavy sans serif typeface used in the original
  title sequence to Jacques Demy's film, \"Les Parapluies de Cherbourg.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE:
  This is /not/ the same face used in posters or packaging (whether vintage in the
  original French or translated later into English as \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\").
  The title sequence may in fact be handlettered, but I suspect it is based upon some
  grotesk that we may all know. I haven't been able to get stills from the sequence
  into my system yet, but until then, here's a quick (albeit small) sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umbrellascherbourg01_3744.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  hope someone will be familiar enough with this classic to help me (or will have
  the DVD in his/her collection).\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a stumper...\r\n\r\n--Michael."

    France's own Roger Excoffon (of Fonderie Olive and \"Antique Olive\" fame).\r\n\r\nWhile
    this face is quite distinct from the Antique Olive family (and arguably superior),
    I just don't see a true digitization available anywhere at this time. I hope I'm

  body: "I couldn't find a reference on title credits for the original film other
    than Bernard Evein, Production Design/Art Director from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058450/fullcredits\"
    target=\"new\">IMBd</a> database. If someone has the video or DVD, they could
    run through the credits.\r\n\r\nIMHO -- Roger Excoffon was still very much alive
    and active during the production of the film in 1964, and I can't imagine the
    producers not \"tipping the hat\" to or not directly consulting someone as well
    known and respected in France as Mr. Excoffon.\r\n\r\nThat leads me to speculate
    that the film title may have been done from a modified version of Antique Olive
    (Nord), specifically customized for film, as it visually reads and repros differently
    from print. It was easy enough in those days to create a filmstrip font for a
    photo headliner machine, so a custom photo font for optical titling is my best
    guess.\r\n\r\nIt may also account for the variations in print titles and posters,
    as Mr. Excoffon (if he did it), or the person who actually designed it, had only
    one specific application using the only font created. If your sample of the film's
    title was the only occurence of that face, then I would say it could have been
    produced as a one-off by hand. But if the rest of the credits used the face, then
    it was produced as a customized filmstrip for a photo-headline device. That's
    my best guess."
