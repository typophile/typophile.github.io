body: This is probably a simple issue, but how does one re-arrange glyph order in
  FontLab? In the shot below notice that "Kcommaaccent.small" is stuck between the
  "L"s? I can't seem to figure out a simple way of shifting it back into position.
  I've tried sorting glyphs based on name, unicode, encoding under the Glyph menu,
  but that just messes everything up. Is there an easy way to just move glyphs into
  the position you want them?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glyphorder.gif]

  body: "Jason,\r\n\r\nIn which view do you want to have them sorted? 'Names mode'
    or 'Index mode'?\r\n\r\nIf 'Names mode' then you'll have to create your own Encoding
    file, which consists in a text file listing your glyphs in the order you want.
    You'll have to save this file in the 'Encoding' folder. (The first line of this
    file also needs to be build in a specific way, in order for Fontlab to recognise
    it. Check the Manual.)\r\n\r\nIf 'Index mode' then the only thing you have to
    do is to select the glyphs and move them around.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have done
    the 'Names mode' step, you don't need the second one, since you can do 'Sort glyphs
    by...' --> 'Encoding' (while in 'Names mode')"

  body: Hi Miguel, thanks for the suggestions. While I was waiting I managed to discover
    the custom encoding procedure, which seems like the thing to do in order to have
    a custom index/order on hand. Your "Index mode" method is what I was looking for
    as a quick fix, but then I'd have to re-sort each font one at a time. The encoding
    file seems like the right route to take. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction(s).

    necessarily. You can automate it, if you're keen with FLPy scripting.\r\nTake
    a look at the following programs:\r\n<a href=\"http://mail.letterror.com/pipermail/fontlab-scripting/2003-May/000066.html\">Sort
    by Adobe OTF Standard Name List</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://mail.letterror.com/pipermail/fontlab-scripting/2003-July/000125.html\">Set
    Encoding & Codepages</a>\r\n"

  body: "What I do is generate a file using >Glyph>Glyph Names> \"Save encoding\"
    .  I then select all glyphs ( in FontLab ) and copy- paste to a text file. I search-replace
    slash with carriage return.  This gives me a list of every glyph drawn. I copy-paste
    this list to Excel and reorder glyphs as I please which is quite easy in Excel.\r\nNext,
    I create a list of numbers in order from 1 to however many you need in the next
    column.  This is very easy using Excel ordinal list formula [cell above] plus
    1 and fill-down to end of list in one full swoop. Just be sure your first few
    glyphs are the same as a normal encoding:\r\n%%FONTLAB ENCODING: [fontlab's given
    number for your saved encoding]; FontName #[fontlab's given number for your saved
    encoding] \r\n.notdef 0\r\nspace 1\r\n.null 2\r\nCR 3\r\n---\r\nafter that, order
    as you wish but be sensible.\r\n\r\nThen, open the encoding you saved (a .enc
    file) in a text editor to find the generated number, etc.\r\n\r\nSave your Excel
    file as \"tab delimited text\" and replace tabs with spaces and CR with Linefeeds.\r\nThen,
    replace the list of glyphs in the encoding with the list you just generated from
    Excel and save as ascii but use .enc as file ending.  \r\nThen replace the original
    file in the exact same location you found it in \"Libraries\".\r\nClose Fontlab
    and restart or reboot.  Then go back to your original Fontlab vfb file and change
    the default encoding the the new encoding you just created.  Then sort by encoding.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to have certain special characters you have designed that have no unicode
    name show up in future fonts, first give them a PUA number so that they always
    have the same position.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds like a great deal of work but
    you only need do it once.  It can be used for every font you design with that
    same number of glyphs and names."

    isn't necessary. Although FontLab generated .enc files number each glyph, for
    a long time now it has been possible to create .enc files that are just lists
    of glyph names (plus the header)."

  body: "Because the code that saves .enc files is older than the code that handles
    .enc files without numbering. I requested the latter from Yuri, many years ago,
    because I was making lots of custom .enc files and didn't like the hassle of numbering
    what was, after all, a sequential list. It makes inserting individual glyphs much
    easier if you don't have to number the lines.\r\n\r\nThis is how one of my typical
    custom .enc files looks:\r\n<code>%%FONTLAB ENCODING: 98943639; Brill Italic Post\r\n%\r\n%
