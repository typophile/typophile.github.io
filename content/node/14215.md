  was a little unsure at first, but the moton graphics, typography, and \"variable\"
  color scheme are just so pleasing to watch. I think this is really putting Bravo
  back on the map.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear others thoughts."

    eat them like mana. So, if a network desires profitability, why would it not latch

    \ NBC is far behind CBS, ABC, FOX; they used to be # 1; in other words \u2014
    you can have the best design, motion graphics etc etc, but you need a great show.
    Without a great show \u2014 nothing will help you. "

    that the design is good on that site? Maybe the on air works but the design on
    that site is absolutely terrible. The flash work is even worse. How can you say
    that thats good when theres stuff like this: http://www.oneill.com/ out there?
    Yeah that design has certain points you can debate but the Bravo site looks like
    someone from 1996 stepped into the future to help out.\r\n"

  body: "Bravo's website looks a real mess to me (not just the scripting errors, but
    the whole graphic/ID thing). It looks like someone has a vague idea of the look
    & feel thay want to create but can't quite be arsed to do it properly. Having
    said that, O'Neills's doesn't do it for me either, so its probaly just that I'm
    getting too old & jaded.\r\n\r\nAs for reality TV, its the execution that's the
    problem (& the saturation). The concept is a good one. Even when BB started (in
    the UK at least), the contestants were mainly fairly ordinary people in a gameshow
    on a minority channel. There was some interest in the way people behave over time
    in that environment. The LCD effect has meant that now the contestants are mainly
    squalking wannabees and the program has spawned a thousand derivations, also full
    of squalking wannabees. \r\n"
