body: "I'm not used to \"prismatic engraved\" fonts, fonts like that Goudy Handtooled
  (that the one that just poped to my mind) with some curves \"removed\" frome the
  plain body of glyph. I hope you understand what I'm trying to explain.\r\nI'm looking
  for some fonts like that for a project and will really appreciate if you could help
  me starting out giving me well known (and maybe less) fonts of that kind so I can
  try searching around. I'm missing some vocabulary too, is prismatic engraved really
  apropriate words to usually describe those fonts ?\r\nThanks."

  body: "Thanks Tiffany for answering. Actually I'm not sure if prismatic is the appropriate
    word for what I'm looking for. Here are some examples at myfonts to illustrate
    :\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/goudy-handtooled/|goudy handtooled]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/burlington/|burlington]]\r\nI
    need some bases to start, any well known types of that taste ?\r\nI'm looking
    for something bold (well, not too much), with great curves, scripty, elegant."

  body: Oh. Maybe "handtooled" would be a better word. They aren't as popular as they
    once were, but here's a Myfonts search for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=handtooled">handtooled</a>.

    is one of my favorites, not exactly the same as handtooled, tho...
