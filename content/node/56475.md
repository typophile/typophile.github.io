body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIve im the process of designing an identity for a nightclub called
  north. Below is an image of the current marque i have come up with in use. the logo
  itself is based around a 5 x 5 grid of dots.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HalftonePagebreaker2_6204.jpg]\r\n\r\nim
  looking for a typeface to accompany this logo, maybe something with lettering made
  from parts of cirle stokes like arcs and semi circles to line up with the grid.
  Im open to suggestions or thoughts\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nSimon"
