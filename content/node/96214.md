body: "I'm after people's thoughts on which currency symbols should be added to a
  text font (Latin extended A). It makes sense to add symbols for currencies used
  by countries which use this character set, but what about \u20B9, \u0E3F, \u20AB
  etc.? And it's plausible that end users might also need deprecated currency symbols
  like French Franc. There doesn't seem to be a standard set. Adobe Source Sans, for
  example, includes Vietnamese dong but not Thai Baht. It's a question of where to
  draw the line, so... where do you draw the line?"

  body: "Perhaps the thinking with Adobe Source Sans was that currency symbols should
    fall in line with the language support for the font. With the exception of the
    Rupee sign this would seem to make sense for Source Sans and explain the exclusion
    of the Thai Baht sign for example.\r\n\r\nIt would also be worth considering in
    the context of the design of a given typeface. So, having the Thai Baht sign in
    a font which does not contain any Thai characters could be redundant, as it would
    not be matched to the look and feel of any particular Thai script."

  body: I considered this, but the Baht symbol is not particularly Thai looking, just
    a B with a vertical bar through it (most currency symbols are distinctly Latin
    in appearance). There are many situations where a currency symbol would be needed,
    even outside that symbol's language - an English language guidebook to Thailand,
    for example. I know the chances of anyone needing the character are slim, but
    if somebody does need it, and they overlook my (or anyone's) font because it doesn't
    include it, then that's a sale lost for the sake of saving all of five minutes
    by not including the symbol. All very hypothetical, I know, but you have to try
    and cater for as many users as possible. I'd put a Baht symbol in a font over
    a Costa Rican Colon, or a Nigerian Naira, despite the writing system of the base
    alphabet, because <cite>I</cite> think it's more useful to my customers (I have
    sold a fair amount of fonts in Thailand, but as far as I recall, none in Nigeria!)

  body: "I have designed currency symbols for fonts that would only be used in the
    context of guidebooks and as such were designed to be mindful of other fonts being
    used in those books (and similar work with arrows, referencing your other thread).
    Without knowing the intended use it is difficult if not impossible to anticipate
    and if someone is planning to use your symbol with a different font other technical
    factors would be considerations, such as relative metrics and the overall look
    and feel. \r\n\r\nI have no working knowledge of these considerations but based
    on recent discussions here regarding deviations from conventional text and display
    character designs in, for example, Cyrillic scripts, it might be worth doing some
    research into these conventions before including these signs. What seems to suit
    the design of a text face aimed at Latin usage might not match relative conventions
    in fonts designed exclusively for or targeted towards text settings for Thai.\r\n\r\nFrom
    my limited experience as a type consumer I must say that the inclusion of additional
    character support is welcome but it is not always clear how useful those additional
    characters will be."

  body: From a brief glance at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_numerals|Wikipedia
    article regarding Thai numerals]] it looks like Thai uses a combination of written
    and Arabic numerals. I have no practical knowledge of currency being used in Thai
    script but this probably means that you would need to be mindful of both forms
    when designing the currency symbol.

  body: "The thing is, if someone wanted to use the Baht symbol with Thai numerals,
    they'd use a different font (which supported Thai). My market would be people
    writing in Latin alphabets, so the symbol would only have to 'work' in this context.
    I lived in Japan a year or two ago, and they have their own kanji form of Yen
    (\u5186), but in Latin fonts, we use the standard \xA5 symbol. I think this is
    the same kind of situation."

    by procrastinating over whether or not to add support for (in general western
    usage) rarified character support, the more the merrier!

  body: "Thai newspapers moved from Thai to Arabic numerals in the early eighties,
    and publishers followed suit. These days Thai numerals are seen only commonly
    on currency.\r\n\r\nI'd include the Baht, and the other ones, as they only take
    a minute or two to design. As a designer, the extra characters are a sign of a
    good quality font.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, the Numero sign (\u2116) is quite
    useful to include too."

  body: "As you say, the font doesn't need to include support for a given writing
    system for it to warrant including the currency symbol associated with that writing
    system (because you might want to do business there with the Latin script). On
    the other hand (and probably for reasons of automatic Latin support) every currency
    (except maybe sea-shells :-) <em>does</em> have a three-letter acronym:\r\nhttp://en.easy-forex.com/int/currencyacronyms.aspx\r\n\r\nI
    think you should include a currency symbol based on: how easy it is to make (which
    is why you might see a Baht more often than a Rupee); and/or the country's GDP
    (or a more refined economic measure like how much international business is conducted
    there).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's money to be made by <em>not</em> including
    exotic characters and waiting for the right people to pay you extra to add them.
