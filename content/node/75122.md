    ;-)\r\n\r\nGlad to be of help. Perhaps it inspires you to design this as a font?"

  body: Are you serious? That "O" doesn't work at all. I thought it was nice that
    at least you replied.

  body: I'd like to see your solution. Perhaps enlarge the sausage but keep the angle?

  body: "You both are right!\r\nIF you absolutly need an O and keep the line consistent
    than Jean Paul's O is the one. However if you want to maintain the style you would
    have to choose to compromise and break the line - ie the o would look like the
    a with the over-reaching arch chopped off. \r\n\r\nThis is very much the case
    of the geometry restricting what letters you can create.\r\n\r\nI had a go at
    something similar [EuroPop] and realised it was only really going to be OK for
    numbers!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FontGroup-EuroPop_3434.png]"
