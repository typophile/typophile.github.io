body: "I need a very particular swashed V. Allow me to describe:\r\n\r\nThe attachment
  (Adobe Caslon Pro, semibold italic) gets very close, but the bowl of the V is too
  soft and ends up looking too much like a \"U\" for the purposes of my project. Can
  anyone think of a typeface that contains a V with a similar character, but a sharper
  bowl? Something a little more angular (but still retaining the sexy-curviness of
  the V shape itself?)\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cl.ly/BNR9/Screen_Shot_2011-10-28_at_6.59.55_PM.png\"/>"
