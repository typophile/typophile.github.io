body: ' How does one calculate appropriate licensing fees for broadcast? Specifically
  a network television sitcom using freeware fonts for opening credits? <BR> <BR>Both
  MTV&#39;s The Osbournes and CBS&#39;s Still Standing are using my freeware fonts
  primarily in the main title sequences of both shows. <BR> <BR>In the case of The
  Osbournes, the font usage has spilled out into licensed merchandise and continues
  to grow the brand based upon my work. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m usually not a stickler about
  licensing nor am I trying to be greedy and take money out of the franchise. I do
  however feel that if a major network is going to use a typeface as the basis of
  the brand of the show that they would attempt to compensate the typeface creator
  by acquiring the appropriate licensing for the font. <BR> <BR>While it is truly
  flattering and I&#39;m excited to see the fonts in use so notibly, no attempts to
  contact me have been made by either network. <BR> <BR>I open it up to the group
  to offer any advice, opions, or suggestions as to what would be fair compensation
  for the usage. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the ear, <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' I had contacted MTV but they were not at all responsive and frankly I don&#39;t
    have the $$$ to sick a lawyer on them. <BR> <BR>You are correct, there are no
    specific terms in my freeware licensing that would protect the fonts from use
    without some commercial license in place. <BR> <BR>Other thoughts that I had entertained
    were to revised the license on my freeware faces to include something to the effect
    of if it&#39;s used for broadcast the Font Diner must be credited or a commercial
    license must be purchased. <BR> <BR>If I tell people they must purchase a commercial
    license for commercial use, I&#39;ll get a ton of e-mail from individuals wanting
    to use it on their business cards and websites. Those aren&#39;t the folks I am
    concenred with as much as I am a major network or company. <BR> <BR>Another great
    suggestion I received was to create a &#34;pro&#34; version of the fonts and release
    them as commercial quality at either my site or My Fonts. Right now, the fonts
    were done very early in my font making career and are quite techincally poor quality.
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps it would encourage people to pay up for the better versions.
    Not becuase I intended it that way by releasing a lower quality first font, but
    becuase the older version is really quite horrid. <BR> <BR>Stuart '

  body: ' While &#39;threaten&#39; may be too strong a word, I  <BR>agree. You have
    to make it absolutely clear  <BR>they&#39;re dealing with the Font Diner &#39;legal&#39;
    or  <BR>&#39;licensing department&#39; and not with Stuart  <BR>Sandler, the small-beans,
    nice guy, type  <BR>designer. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an approach: <BR> <BR>Write
    a letter &#40;from your Font Diner licensing  <BR>dept.&#41; saying you&#39;re
    aware they&#39;re using the  <BR>fonts in violation of the licensing agreement.  <BR>Attach
    an invoice to the letter. No confrontation  <BR>or name-calling necessary. It
    gives them the  <BR>benefit of the doubt and doesn&#39;t paint you as a  <BR>pushover.
    <BR> <BR>Then if they don&#39;t pay it, you&#39;ll have more  <BR>ground to call
    a lawyer or seek legal action. <BR> <BR>Good luck with it. &#40;And geez, don&#39;t
    apologize <BR>for having a successful font!&#41; <BR> <BR>PS -- I&#39;d love to

  body: Thanks for the tip Jim, however it has reached internet saturation already
    as that. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=osbournes%2Bfont">googled
    here</a> <BR> <BR>Different than the Harry Potter face, this font was always freely
    distributed. It wasn&#39;t until this discussion I transitioned my Silverware
    library to TT only and the end user needed to buy the commercial license of the
    face to get the PS version and the license. <BR> <BR>By the way Joe, I took your
    suggestion but sent &#39;em an invoice and it eventually was paid. Not by MTV
    or the production company who did the titling, but by the artist who designed
    the credits because font licensing was his responsibility to MTV. <BR> <BR>Oh
    well, the license expires each season, so if I see the faces used come fall, you
    can bet another invoice will be showing up in MTV&#39;s mailbox. <BR> <BR>Stuart
