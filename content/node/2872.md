body: Good morning to everybody, <BR>i am making a research on the theme of modular
  typefaces and their changes over the time. It is very difficult finding good books
  about this theme. Most of them only offer Examples of typefaces, but very few are
  giving background informations.  <BR>Maybe you know more.  :-&#41;

  body: There&#39;s a new book out on Wim Crouwel&#39;s work. It has a blue cover
    &#40;of course&#41;, and lots of images of many many of his types, as used in
    posters from the &#39;50s on. <BR>Very impressive.

  body: 'That&#39;s true. I bought this book some time ago. His grid work is very
    impressive. There is another book that i can recommend: <a href="http://www.redstonepress.co.uk/tmwebservices/newsite/abz/"
    target="_blank">http://www.redstonepress.co.uk/tmwebservices/newsite/abz/</a>
    <BR> <BR>But the books that i am looking for, are going more in the direction
    of the wim crouwel book. '

  body: Martin. I recv&#39;d your email this morning. I thought I&#39;d post publicly
    because I&#39;d be curious myself about this. I&#39;m in the middle of collecting
    more books for the library &#40;time consuming in and of itself&#41;. <BR> <BR><b>Questions
    for Martin &#40;but can be answered by all&#41;:</b> <BR>Does Wim Crouwel&#39;s
    book have a bibliography?  <BR>What other typefaces do you consider modular? <BR>Do
    the designer&#39;s of these typefaces have books which they have written? <BR>Have
    you looked through magazine indexes?  <BR>Does modularity in typeface design belong
    strictly to modernism? Or does it flow into post-modernism as well?

  body: Tiffany, on your first question, Crouwel&#39;s book doesn&#39;t have a bibliography
    but in the notes to the illustrations and the long interview by Kees Broos, he
    mentions a few references. Mostly periodicals, though.

  body: The book Martin is looking for would be heavy on categorization, eg &#34;How
    many Modules?&#34; and &#34;Shape of Module&#34; and &#34;Is there a grid?&#34;
    and &#34;Are the modules discrete?&#34; <BR> <BR>Pixel fonts have one module.
    <BR>Faces like Relay, LCD and Klaxon have more. <BR>Test Pilot Collective has
    many interesting designs with strong modularity. <BR>And then there&#39;s the
    classic, mysterious Fregio Mecano &#40;22 units&#41;. <BR>Don&#39;t forget Clotilde
    Olyffe. <BR> <BR>

    references to what Nick called the  &#34;mysterious Fregio Mecano.&#34;  Mysterious,
    indeed... Does anyone know where I might find a visual reference to see what this
    face looks like or how it works? '

  body: I came across it in &#34;130 Alphabets &amp; other signs&#34; by Julian Rothenstein
    and Mel Gooding, Thames &amp; Hudson, 1993. The same authors repeat the specimen
    in &#34;ABZ, more alphabets and other signs&#34;, Redstone Press, 2003. <BR> <BR>There
    is a font, CG Section, that is an instance of the Fregio Mecano system.

    Wim Crouwel&#39;s book have a bibliography?  <BR>No, he doesn&#39;t. He mentioned
    though some names that i will look after. But there are not many that are so consequent
    like Wim Crouwel. <BR> <BR>&#62; What other typefaces do you consider modular?  <BR>LIke

  body: 'Your definition is too broad. <BR>The conditions for a modular typeface should
    be: <BR>1&#41; the modules are separate <BR>2&#41; there is a limited number of
    modules <BR> <BR>In particular, there should be no joining strokes of irregular
    length between modules.'

  body: 'You are right, the definition is very broad. But i am in the beginning of
    my research and do not want to decide in this state what is and what isn&#39;t
    a modular typeface.  <BR>After your definition overlapping modules cannot produce
    a modular typeface, which would exclude very interesting typefaces based on modules.  <BR>I
    agree though to make a difference in between constructed and modular typefaces.  '

  body: I think the broader you look the better you can analyse something interesting
    &#40;as opposed to merely useful&#41; out of Modularity. Like you, I don&#39;t
    think it&#39;s a good idea to have a very strict formal-structural benchmark.
    Maybe you should look at a module as any formal shape &#40;out of a fixed set&#41;
    that can however be applied in different ways, although only through predefined
    formal rules. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
