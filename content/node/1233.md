  body: Oh, I know there are variations of individual letters. <BR> <BR>But I figured
    those were modifications of the font.  <BR> <BR>dunno. Maybe it has been made
    into a font after the fact.... <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Hehe, I commend your efforts, Jill. But I would call that a <BR>crude interpretation
    of the &#34;Nightmare...&#34; titling. All of <BR>these are certainly close and
    probably the best you can get <BR>without drawing it by hand &#40;as most of the
    original surely was&#41;.

  body: BJ, <BR> <BR>Are you looking for this particular logo, or do you need font
    to create something else?  <BR> <BR>If you need the logo itself, I can e-mail
    it to you in Illustrator fomat. It says &#34;Tim Burton&#39;s The Nightmare Before
    Christmas.&#34; <BR> <BR>

  body: Thanks all. <BR> <BR>I went with the scriptorium version...before da font
    <BR>was posted. <BR> <BR>The client, a retail chain, actually sells a large volume
    of <BR>licensed Nightmare products, especially in October. <BR>So they wanted
    three dozen shirts for an in-house manager&#39;s <BR>meeting during the middle
    of October. <BR> <BR>They just wanted it to say,\ <BR> <BR>Welcome to my Nightmare&#40;front&#41;
    <BR>Manager&#39;s Meeting 2003 &#40;back&#41; <BR> <BR>Wish it was more exciting!

    Victorian Swash</a> is almost a light version of Goodfellow. The two are remarkably
    similar but for the weight.
