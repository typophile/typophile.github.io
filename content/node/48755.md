body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a font called \"Minion Phonetic\", a Minion
  family font containing characters of the International Phonetic Alphabet. A google
  search returned nothing, and it doesn't seem to be available from major font foundries.
  I have found it used in pdfs (by clicking on properties>fonts) from the academic
  publisher John Benjamins, for example in the pdfs of the Diachronica journal: http://www.benjamins.com/cgi-bin/t_bookview.cgi?bookid=DIA%2023%3A1\r\nDoes
  anybody know where I might have a chance to find this font?"

  body: I am not sure I've heard of this version of Minion. It could be a custom font
    created for John Benjamins Alternatively there is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/itc_stone_serif_phonetic_medium/">ITC
    Stone Serif Phonetic</a>.
