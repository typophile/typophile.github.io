body: "Hello, I am new to this forum. I am not at all experienced in design or typography,
  so I apologize in advance.\r\n\r\nI noticed the version of Akzidenz-Grotesk used
  on Josef M\xFCller-Brockmann's posters (http://www.blanka.co.uk/supersize?product=1301)
  is different from the digital versions currently available from Berthold. To me
  it looks like the bowl lowercase 'a' is more curved at the top, as it is in Helvetica.
  Also, the foot (what do you call that?) is much smaller, almost gone. It actually
  looks a lot like the 'a' in the logo at the top of the website that says \"Blanka.\"
  Is this not Akzidenz-Grotesk? If so, why are the newer versions different? Is there
  currently a typeface available that more closely resembles that of the poster?\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your time!\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\ntrough\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>EDIT:</em> I just
  found http://typophile.com/node/41683, which has mostly answered my question. But
  I still have not found a version that has that nice lowercase 'a.'"
