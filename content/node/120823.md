  here: http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html\r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to use the Arabic shedda along with other non-Syriac diacritics on Syriac letters.
  I have made sure that these diacritics are indeed already included in the font.
  When I try to use them on an initial or medial letter, it breaks the cursive and
  the next letter in line takes its initial form. This doesn't happen with the standard
  Syriac combining characters.\r\n\r\nI opened the font in FontForge to see if I could
  get an idea why this is happening but I can't come up with anything. All the lookups
  and anchors are standard across all the diacritics (Syriac or not). There must be
  something I'm missing that's causing the font to break.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    I'm using the Mellel text editor when typing the font.

  body: Sorry guys, after more experimenting, this seems to be an issue with Mellel
    and not the font. The font works fine in TextEdit.
