It seems there are far more people involved in type design who are from  Canada than the size of their population would support. Maybe long winters make people glyph skilled? Other than the Netherlands, I can&rsquo;t think of a single country with more type centrics per capita. 
I wonder if all Canadians on Typophile would tell us what they think is common to their life that brings out the talent and inclination to pursue design type? Whatever the reason, I am glad it happens :-)</p>

<p>We ask the same question about Americans.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government doesn&rsquo;t treat the water with flourides, but with glyphlets, and the fronts that control the weather here originate in Hattem, The Netherlands. Our bullets are typographic, and our pentagons are used to structure page geometry. The frost on the windowpanes here crystallizes according to a bezier logic, but if it is really cold the serifs snap off.</p>

<p>Some of us live in <a href="http://www.vansterdamtravel.com/">Vansterdam</a>, which can influence your outlook on a few things. Canadian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote a whole book about our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy:_The_Making_of_Typographic_Man">Gutenburg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</a>, and many of us can blame <a href="www.veer.com">Veer</a>.</p>
<p>As for <em>&hellip;Candians period:</em> Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau">Trudeau</a> said about Americans: &ldquo;Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.&rdquo; So a lot of us define ourselves in contrast to Americans.</p>

We also tend to see isolation and lack of recognition as romantic, which also fits well. If the goal of good typography is to be understated, Canada&rsquo;s a great place to do it from.</p>
<p>(The fact that I&rsquo;ve been hesitating to hit the &ldquo;Post comment&rdquo; button for the past 10 minutes and have re-read the above paragraph about 20 times, wondering if it&rsquo;s too obnoxious, also speaks to this attempt at decorum, and this kind of obsessive-compulsive behaviour is probably also common in the type-inclined.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I grew up in a bilingual city, Montréal, which is also the home to many immigrant communities. (A secondary school trip to the Northwest Territories allowed me to hear and see the Inuktitut language.) As a result I was surrounded by language, both spoken and written, and when I worked at a typesetting bureau, I was taught how to set French, which is not how one sets English. So I understood that type is not an inflexible system of marks, but is a living thing.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s my theory. You get yourself a humble multi-lingual country, throw in some long winters for good measure, and you get &ldquo;slow-makers&rdquo;, people who take their time on long-term projects, like writing novels and making typefaces.</p>

<p>Indeed, though I found when I lived there, that Canadian comedy (television comedies, mostly) were terribly <cite>un-</cite>funny. Perhaps it is due to my odd sense of humor, but I couldn&rsquo;t stand to watch Canadian shows, however they do allow bad words after bedtime, so I&rsquo;ll give them credit for that.</p>

<p>You really think so, more than the Netherlands?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the numbers The Netherlands population is about 16 million, the US about 293 million - so for every active Dutch type designer you&rsquo;d need 19 active US type designers - that might be pushing it. But I would not be surprised if Yuri has sold more than 19 times the number of FL licenses to US residents than Dutch residents. &lsquo;spose it just depends on the definitions you pick.</p>
<p>FWIW Canada&rsquo;s popualtion of 32.5 million is about 1/9 of the US.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Chris Lozos, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m after a period, I moved to Turkey.
I will copy a piece of the interview.</p>
<hr>
<p>I live in a place that is green and wild: rural Vancouver
Island, British Columbia, Canada. It is one of those
places where civilization is just touching wilderness, so
my home is surrounded by tall cedar and hemlock forests,
rocks, mosses and wildlife. My house is small, with a
large natural garden frequented by various types of
animals - but ruled by my dog and cat!</p>
<p>Despite its remote location, Vancouver Island is rich with
art and culture. The First Nations in this area have a rich
artistic heritage, and there are many totems and carvings.</p>
<p>I am a graphic designer at Suburbia Advertising in
Victoria, BC, a small, upscale advertising agency
employing fourteen people, and specializing in retail
advertising. My background includes seven years of working
at larger international ad agencies in Toronto, Canada. Not
surprisingly, I love working with type!</p>
<p>Like many kids, I doodled on my schoolbooks, and even
though drawing was one of my favorite pastimes, I always
doodled letters rather than drawings, on my books. (Alex,
do you know what doodling is?! Strange word, no?)</p>
<p>I remember clearly the moment I first encountered &lsquo;real&rsquo;
ink… I was probably about thirteen, sitting at my brothers
drafting table. He had an ink pen meant for sketching, and
I picked it up and started drawing letters. I remember
watching the dark liquid become animated – so unlike the
ballpoint pens and markers I was used to. I was entranced.
Not long after that, I bought my first calligraphy set and
my goal that summer was to spend one hour each day
practicing.</p>
<p>My life since then has included long periods where I put
calligraphy aside, in favor of my work - design and
typography, but something keeps pulling me back to
calligraphy. The magazine &ldquo;Letter Arts Review has been
inspirational and key to my picking up the pen again, many
times. Over the years I have watched calligraphy grow and
evolve on it&rsquo;s pages. Also, when I was younger, I knew I
would do more calligraphy when I was older – what a
surprise!, I&rsquo;m older now! :)</p>
<hr>
<p>Best,
AS</p>

<p>Nah, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll find that&rsquo;s true. If we used &ldquo;per capita&rdquo; by its most frequent meaning it would not be true. The United States is a huge country and consists of many different states (regions). In a country so large there are differing mentalities and opinions that are often regional. Being a guy from the Mid-West who has lived on the East Coast and now the West Coast these places could all be different countries. New York City has more in common with London than it does with West Virginia.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to use the per capita definition and apply it by state we might be on to something. But considering how concentrated the American population is on the extreme coasts I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be accurate to use &ldquo;per capita&rdquo; in the U.S. I&rsquo;d be willing to bet money that there are less than 7 type designers in South Dakota.</p>
<p>Even in New York City I personally know of maybe two people who design typography. Groups of college friends deciding to start a type foundry together doesn&rsquo;t happen here in the U.S. very often, but I hear about it all the time in Europe.</p>
<p>I think the U.S. has a basic lack of respect for the arts and design. There&rsquo;s too much of a &ldquo;get a real job mentality&rdquo; that persists here. If that weren&rsquo;t true, there would be more Ph.D. art and design programs as well as a Master&rsquo;s and Undergraduate type design programs.</p>
<p>Just &lsquo;cuz I like drawing, don&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m dumb.</p>

<p>although the Netherlands beats South Dakota 2:1 the population of The Netherlands is almost twenty times that of South Dakota. Per capita South Dakota is ten times more typographic than the NL.</p>
<p>Somewhat more seriously if you define a type designer as someone who has designed a font from scratch, either as a custom (non retail) design, a retail design, or created a freeware or shareware font in say the last five years I&rsquo;d guess that you could easily find over 2000 US residents who would qualify. Could you find 100 Dutch or 200 Canadians? Possibly in the case of the Dutch but Canada, I doubt it.</p>
<p>I think the US economy/education system encourages activities like type-design - I know there are plenty of part-time/hobbyist type designers out there (maybe they need a distraction from their day jobs or school work) and there are plenty of jack-of-all-trades graphic designers who are forced to dabble in type design with respect to paying projects.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t even mention the U.S. I was just attempting to compliment Canada on having such a positive affect on type design. My straw poll was just my experience on Typophile and the people I met at TypeCon. I don&rsquo;t think very highly of Bush either but he doesn&rsquo;t even know how to spell typography let alone affect it. 
I was kinda hoping for more stories like Chester&rsquo;s humorous yet acurate post above.  Chester, thanks for having a sense of humor.  You probably need it on cold Winter nights when your hard disk dies and you lose all of your work&ndash;at least you can swear in a couple of languages :-)</p>

<p>It was certainly nice to be invited to contribute an MS report. I hope I gave appropriate credit to other technology companies who are innovating in the type and type technology space. I think Henrik had included non country reports in the past, and I hope his replacements do the same. I agree with those on the ATypI list that there should be room for delegates representing internationally used scripts and writing systems (eg Arabic &amp; Cyrillic) but I think finding volunteers prepared to put in the effort will be hard.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What about them, ellipsis&hellip;  You are what you eat, right? Then forget McDo. Great minds comes from  &hellip; well, you guessed it. Large tempests that grow in the south seas, make their way slowly to the great white north, but not before leaving most of the useless particles behind them. What is left is of great advantage to the people of Canada, since type designers will benefit from what grows from the land. It is fair to say that it has to be a gift from the heavens. In the summer, (yes, there is summer over there) the country that is known to have igloos for shelter instead of houses as most south bordeans that could not pinpoint it on a globe are lead to believe, those icy blocks have a tendency to get a little softy, but winter wise are as hard as rock, just like metal typefaces. So then, creativity that comes from the land of the ice cubes is apparently a natural gift, enough to make jealousy grow in the world around them. PERIOD.</div>

<p>Yes, the Jazz fest definitely has plenty of wonderful things to offer, (Bugge Wesseltoft played it this year&hellip;) but you have to pay a whole lot for the good stuff. The free shows are a little stuck in a rut, and getting more commercial every year.</p>
