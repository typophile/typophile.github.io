I havent had the chance to rework the body copy yet&hellip; but that will get done when i get the chance. Unfortunately we&rsquo;re only allowed to use one side of the flyer (even though I really like some of the suggestions to split the flyer over the two sides). Further comments and suggestions welcomed!</p>
<p>P.S - I&rsquo;ve noticed some of the sperm come out looking rather fuzzy, this is only because of the image compression ;-)</p>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I was recently assigned a project in my second year Communication Design course and have come up with a decent concept but am looking for ways to improve either the design or type or both before handing in finals. Below I have included a quick backgrounder on the project and attached the PDF file. Thanks for taking the time to look at this everyone… I really appreciate it!</p>
<p><strong>Quick Backgrounder</strong>
This project will address the social impact of graphic design and allow you to explore print design as a vehicle of persuasion. You will research a social health or environmental issue and develop a strong point of view about it. Using words and images you will produce a provocative, visually dynamic and persuasive flyer aimed at a specific audience.</p>
<p>The topic I decided on was <strong>Teenage Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong>
Your objective is to make the best use of the vehicle available to persuade the target audience to accept your point of view.</p>

Your image needs to be absolutely clear how a condom works, any ambiguity could confuse, I know that most teenagers will know how they work but the ones that don&rsquo;t probably represent your chief target audience.
What is the size of your flyer?

<p>But in addition to that, if you have time, I would reconsider the illustration style, especially the default illustrator brush outlines. The technique doesn&rsquo;t feel as serious as the problem you&rsquo;re trying to address. I know you&rsquo;re going for the teen audience and trying to be casual, but I would personally give it another iteration to really nail how menacing the sperm look.</p>

<p><strong>Brampitoyo:</strong> 
Yeah you&rsquo;ve got the idea, just an overall critique to do with anything&hellip; design, type, or communication of the message.</p>
<p><strong>timd  &amp; KenBessie </strong> 
Sorry my fault about the strong tags, didn&rsquo;t realize I had left one open. Should be fixed now :-) Hmmm I totally agree with your points about the image not working to its potential&hellip; perhaps by duplicating the sperm, making them smaller and more aggressive looking I could create that swarm effect I&rsquo;m looking for. About the condom, I see what you mean it being rather ambiguous with the sword and all, but I was hoping to go for a more comical approach. But I think as you said it could have more of an impact if the condom was over the egg in some fashion protecting it. <strong>timd</strong>, when you talk about changing to the 1/3 concept, do you mean redoing the entire design or just choosing to use that as my main catch header? Oh and the flyers size is 8.5 x 14 an insert into a magazine with no diecuts or folds.</p>
<p><strong>mllecait</strong>
Hmm that’s an idea, do you know of any good sources to get more illustrator bushes? Not sure what style I would go with, but it would be interesting to try out a few other looks</p>
<p><strong>seventy7</strong>
Yeah your totally right about this, my copy will change before the final. The main concepts that I wanted to get across are there in the text, but the copy needs a lot of tweaking and cleaning up.</p>
<p>Thanks once again to all who commented! You all had great suggestions and I think I have few more ideas to take this flyer to the next level.</p>

<p>In that case, you&rsquo;ve got two sides to work with. I would suggest the 20 million to one message on the front (&lsquo;cause its attention-getting), and the three to one message on the back (&lsquo;cause it offers more information).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Either you need to improve your current image or think it from another angle, my feelings are that you should think about the 3:1 as it speaks to your audience personally and that will require a redesign. However, if you want to stick with the 20 million headline your illustration should in some way represent that, you could represent that in the cartoon style or with an image like <a href="http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/classes/FrameSet.aspx?&UQR=ruiykd&pk=4&source=front&lightboxView=1&txtSearch=sperm&selImageType=7&chkLicensed=on&chkRoyaltyFree=on&chkNLM=on">this</a> or a information graphic. The condom, because it doesn&rsquo;t, shouldn&rsquo;t be represented as protecting the egg, you could represent it as something catching/blocking the sperm. I&rsquo;m not sure that a cartoon style works to portray a serious subject. As it is a magazine insert and less likely to be read by three people at once you might need to rewrite the body copy a little.

Think OUTSIDE the box - and page, and literal delivery of the concept.</p>
<p>More specifics: the condom &lsquo;defending&rsquo; the egg doesn&rsquo;t really move us forward in terms of social/sexual equality, nor does it in my opinion reflect a strong or accurate message of where/why/how condoms should be used and viewed by teens. I also don&rsquo;t like the idea of swords anywhere near my sperm. Think about your audience.</p>

I think &ldquo;sperm&rdquo; needs to be kept with 20 million for the message to get through first read.

<p>Try this:
20 million sperm.
1 egg.
Like the odds?</p>
<p>On three separate lines. Use a nice condensed sans (that&rsquo;s still friendly enough, of course) and the retrofit each line, so &ldquo;1 egg&rdquo; would have a bigger size than &ldquo;20 million sperms&rdquo;. The nice thing about this method is that it&rsquo;ll really highlight your main point.</p>
<p>Visually, I like number 6 if you would further highlight the condom. I can&rsquo;t see the suggested &ldquo;tip&rdquo; very well. It&rsquo;s really clever, though!</p>
