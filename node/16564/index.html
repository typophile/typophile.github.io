<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm thinking of organizing some occasional typographic social activities of some sort here in Seattle. I'm wanting to figure out if there are Seattle Typophiles I don't already know. Or for that matter that I know, but didn't realize lived in the Seattle area. Of course there's me, and Si. But I'm sure there must be more of you out there....
Note: I would also welcome contact info for type geeks not on the list.
Other typographic folks I know in the area include the rest of the Microsoft Typography team, a few typographic folks from Adobe Seattle, the gentlemen from Linguist's Software (international fonts), John D Berry (writer and typographer), Mamoun Sakkal (Arabic type designer), and Ole Sorenson (local designer and Meetup organizer).
Cheers,
T

<div class=commentbody>I wish there were a similar crowd here in the Washington DC area. I think only Bill Berkson and I are near here though. He being the Classic and me being the Comic, perhaps we could found a comic book series based on classic type faces :-)

<div class=commentbody>Hi Tom,
There are these guys - http://www.azalea.com/AboutUs/ - Jerry is an ex-Aldus barcode boffin. I'll point him to this thread.
There's Mr Bogge, http://www.letterspace.com/ but is he still in town or in Italy?
Of course there are lots of other type people and designers at the company that I can reach via internal mailing lists - so once you have something planned let me know and I'll help spread the word.

I'd welcome a few students, too. :)

<div class=commentbody>Years ago (1992-93) Garret Boge lived in a apartment near the Kingdome but he sold it and moved. Last time I saw him was at AtypI in Rome and he was planning on moving to Rome. So Si is probably right he's either there or back and forth.

<div class=commentbody>There was once a type group that met in the cafe in the basement of the wonderful bookstore near the old Aldus offices near Pioneer Square. Besides John Berry, of those who are still (or again) in Seattle, I remember Andras Furesz (of Very Graphics, book dealer who was once one of the few sources of hard-to-get European type books) and Nick Nussbaum (now at Microsoft). There were others whose names I do not remember, but I bet John would know.
John Cornicello is another ex-typesetter. Other Seattle type types (haven’t heard from them in awhile, so don’t know if they are still around) include Ben Bauermeister, typesetter Mike Arst, and Andy Taylor (Japan Pacific Publications) who used to typeset exclusively in Japanese).

<div class=commentbody>That would be Elliot Bay Books.
http://www.elliottbaybook.com/
Apart from Aldus, Design Intelligence (acquired by MS) and ElseWare (acquired by HP) were other local companies involved in type and type technology.

Many of those folks are still around.

<div class=commentbody>Hey, KT,
John Cornicello and Ben Bauermeister are both colleagues of mine at Adobe (as is Ole Kvern).
Si,
When did MS acquire Design Intelligence? I seem to recall hearing that their IP was still up for grabs just a couple of years ago.

<div class=commentbody>I'm thinking of doing something in late January, the weekend of the 28th. I may have to cap attendance at some level, though. I doubt our place could handle more than 25-30 in winter (unless we do some serious rearranging downstairs). In summer we could overflow to the rather large back deck, so we'd be nearly unlimited.
I'll keep folks posted....

Always seems to be busy, and no recent doom-and-gloom stories in the local press - unlike during the early days of Amazon.com when the press predicted every bookshop would go out of business.
