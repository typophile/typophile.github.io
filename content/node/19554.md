  after every end quote glyph.\r\n\r\nwhen i check the kerning between the quote and
  the space it's 6967. {??!!??????}\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know what is causing this?
  is there a way to fix it without having to go in and manually set the kerning to
  0?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\u2026\r\n\r\n------\r\nnick cottrell\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.istitch.net/typophile/messedupquote.jpg\">image</a>"

    an edited or pirated copy. Monotype wouldn't make that kerning decision.
