body: Is there a way to convert a CMYK swatch to it's Pantone equivalent? I can do
  it the other way around but can't figure out a way to do this. I'm working with
  a 2C logo that was inexplicably created using CMYK and I'd like to convert it to
  a two-color design.

  body: Try plugging the cmyk values into the color palette in Photoshop and then
    select the pantone guide. It should come up with the closest PMS color.

  body: "\"Try plugging the cmyk values into the color palette in Photoshop and then

    work almost everytime. And if the logo is to be printed them Its really a problem.
    The cmyk values must be corrected manually. If not you will have a diferent color!
    I have that experince in pantone 179 (a dark red) that converted directly to cmyk
    results in printed page orange!\r\nThis is really an issue!\r\nSo the best way
    is to ask to the print house a catalogue with cmyk values and them convert manually
    to the best value (eg that matches best with your pantone number).\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: Get your hands on a Pantone Color Bridge and see the CMYK and Pantone equivalents
    side by side. Then you can see how similar/different the different colors are.
    Find someone who has this swatch book and borrow it to find this out. You might
    have to shell out for one, but it's worth it later on.

  body: You're welcome, Patty. Obviously you'll want to check it against a swatchbook
    as others have noted.

  body: "Yes, I have checked it using the Color Bridge - which I agree is a great
    investment. The problem was I didn't have a printed piece to reference for color
    so rather than just guestimate I wanted a starting point. \r\n\r\nI was just doing
    this as a favor for a friend, so whether or not the colors match exactly is kinda
    not really my problem. I gave her the disclaimer that there you never get an exact
    match between spot color and process. But even if the color's off it will look
    better in 2C spot than 4C.\r\n\r\nThanks again, all."
