  body: i believe so. apparently they have digital versions of some hard-to-find titles.
    perhaps they're hard to find because their website is so poor and hasn't been
    updated in what looks like a decade. I wish they would just put their library
    on myfonts and make it more accessible.

  body: "Castcraft was at one time a distributor and caster of metal type. Both Monotype
    and foundry. Though tey had licenses to recast with European foundries, such as
    Stempel and Bauer, they were not that well regarded.\r\n\r\nAt some point they
    digitized an awful lot of these. As Paul says some of them are quite hard to find
    elsewhere. The problem is that these are not often the best renditions and are
    technically quite poor. \r\n\r\nGerald"
