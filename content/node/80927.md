  body: "From the look of it, it's a monospaced \"programmer\" font, all of which
    have some sort of slashed zero. Monaco (shipped with Mac OS from early on, lately
    replaced by Menlo), for one, is similar. \r\nSome more examples in this thread:

  body: Yes, certainly looks like a monospaced font. It is not monaco though, as the
    top stroke on the '1' is slightly curved on monaco whereas it is straight here.
    Will have a look through my collection soon and see if anything matches...
