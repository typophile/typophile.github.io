  in the countryside. On the bottom of an ashtray that lied in the kitchen since the
  80's (I remember seeing it there even when I was a little kid) there was a rosetta
  decoration that resembles quite a lot the BP Helios mark.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bpashtray_3999.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bplogo_4245.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  asked my grandmother if she remembered anybody from Landor coming to visit her and
  showing interest in that ashtray, but she couldn't.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/generalashtray_5805.jpg]\r\nThe
  orange stuff in the back is a delicious pumpkin pie."

    have 18 corners and three levels of petals. It's a perfect match!

    This is such a great find. <em>(Mmmh \u2014 Pie. ;)</em>"

    I clearly remember the old bearded man who gave it to me saying something like
    'my son, when you see the light, you will know it'.\r\nI have been searching for
    answers to that statement all my life since getting it.  I have tried quitting
    smoking too and you have now given me what I have so desperately been searching
    for all these years!\r\n\r\nI can now stop smoking and smash that ashtray since
    it has fulfilled it's purpose... always remember - fill up with BP cos that old
    man gave me that ashtray and I saw this here... it's so obvious now!\r\n\r\n*sigh*"

  body: "No, no. Grandma isn't smoking. In the Romanian countryside for a woman to
    smoke is unheard of. But all the men do. Like locomotives.\r\n\r\nAnyways, if
    you promise to be good kids, maybe next time I'll tell you the story of how I
    found the Euronews logo on the bottom of a wine barrel (to avoid further discussions
    know that Grandma isn't drinking either)."
