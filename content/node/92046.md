body: "Gandhi, the biggest bookstore chain in Mexico is giving away a full type family
  named Gandhi. The web page states that the typeface will ease Mexican's reading
  by: having big body size, being light and thus achieving ideal weight when printed
  under less than ideal conditions by ink spread (the page cites inkjet printing),
  unadorned and undistracting, designed for body copy but friendly when used big.\r\n\r\nGandhi
  has been known for one of the longest and more memorable ad campaigns in Mexico:
  http://gandhi.com.mx/index.cfm/Publicidad and this typeface seems to be part of
  the advertising strategy, \"To make you read\" (Mexico has a real low reading rate.).\r\n\r\nIt
  was designed by Cristobal Henestrosa (Espinosa, Fondo) , Ra\xFAl Plancarte (Tauran,
  Kukulkan), David Kimura (TDC 2009) and Gabriela Varela . The family will be featured
  in the 5th Tipos Latinos biennale.\r\n\r\nYou can download the type familiy here:\r\nhttp://www.tipografiagandhi.com/\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think of it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gandhi_5436.png]"

    But then, I can't tell the difference between Lucida and Stone... these 21st-century
    typefaces all look alike to me.\r\n\r\nWell, not <em>all</em> of them, since lots
    of today's typefaces are highly unique - but there's this big group of typefaces
    that are intended to be contemporary and readable and have a sans and a serif
    that somehow belong to the same family that <em>do</em> look so much alike."

    I think it is really good that you came on this forum to respond to some of the

    it is extremely instructive to see how people who design type faces think and

    will it ever have) old-style figures?"

  body: "Dear typophiles:\r\n\r\nAll your comments regarding typefaces I contributed
    to design are always welcome. I\u2019d like to explain some of our decisions.\r\n\r\nThe
    main purpose of Gandhi is to be useful for a non professional user. That\u2019s
    the reason behind the big x-height, the weight lighter than usual, the families
    consisting of four members, and so on.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when developing
    Fondo, I did some tests about what \u201Ccommon readers\u201D* in Mexico actually
    like when it comes to typefaces. One of my conclusions was that people do like
    lighter weights (in Mexico City, at least). I must confess that it was a bit disappointing
    because I do prefer darker weights (you can see Espinosa Nova or Fondo for that)
    but this experience told me that many people love pages composed with Berkeley
    Oldstyle Book rather than with, say, Adobe Jenson. (Please notice: it was not
    a comprehension or speed test, it was only about what the people looks appealing
    to read). So for this Gandhi project we decided to follow that trend.\r\n\r\n*
    In this context, \u201Ccommon readers\u201D refers to people who bought a book
    published by Fondo de Cultura Econ\xF3mica at some bookstores located in Mexico
    City.\r\n\r\nSince it wasn\u2019t our main goal, we didn\u2019t run any offset
    tests before releasing Gandhi, but we printed a lot on inkjet and laser printers,
    and I\u2019d say the result was pretty good in both cases.\r\n\r\n<cite> > The
    sans follows the serif a little too slavishly.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s probably true,
    but I\u2019d say it is not an error, but something done in purpose. We decided
    that a typeface for a bookstore chain should have some \u201Cserifness\u201D on
    it, so it can be better related with books.\r\n\r\n<cite> > It appears that the
    roman and italic are equal in width for the sans, but not for the serif.\r\n\r\nTrue,
    the width in Sans Regular and Sans Italic are very similar (not identical), but
    that doesn\u2019t happen in the serif. That\u2019s what we thought was better
    for each design. Not quite consistent, I am afraid.\r\n\r\n<cite> > Remember that
    the more printing a person/place does the more likely it will be on a laser and
    not an inkjet.\r\n\r\nHrant: many people use inkjet printers for text purposes.
    It probably doesn\u2019t make sense at all, but that\u2019s the way it is. I guess
    it is because they can print in color when needed, even if it is not the best
    option for text. They can just live with that, as long as they can decipher the
    characters."

    all accessible via OT features.\r\n\r\n<cite> > Of the many free fonts that I
    have seen, the Ghandi fonts seem to be among the best.\r\n\r\nThank you! It\u2019s
    very early to make a final judgment but so far Gandhi has been extremely well
    received by the people it was designed for. Good to know it likes you too."

  body: I too favour a heavier look to text, but there is a particular aesthetic to
    typography of lighter faces that can be very pleasing if it is done well. Ideally,
    the paper should be creamy, not too white, and the linespacing carefully balanced
    to the internal whites of the lines of text. Digital Elektra printed offset is
    a good example of a light type that, with careful handling, can be both very attractive
    on the page and very readable.
