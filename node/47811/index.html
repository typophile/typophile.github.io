  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Have just found this site after a year and a half in design wilderness!</p>
<p>Am about to start a company called Bedouin Travel, it&rsquo;s based in London and the main activities are: 1. Islamic Pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia and 2. General tours and holidays off the beaten track in the Middle East (Syria, Jordan, and Oman amongst others).</p>
<p>Am looking for a font that reflects the companies professionalism in a market full of amateurs, with a consistent and clean (i.e. not over fussy or elaborate) brand image. To make an similae with cars, when I started the project I was pitching the image level at around the Bentley/Aston Martin luxury level when that was not an accurate reflection of the product or the market I&rsquo;m going for. Continuing the car similae, it&rsquo;s more around the Audi/Lexus/Saab/Volvo level of image. Reliable, well made, high quality but not necessarily ostentatious, lives up to expectations and comfortable.</p>
<p>I have had a logo designed (see attached) which I do like because it hints at something of the east without necessarily being over-islamic because many of my customers won&rsquo;t be. I could change the font of the logo but would need a very good reason to do so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried serif fonts (Palatino) not sure it works on web, and san-serif (Optimum - which I like but not sure it works for the brand and now Avenir - which I really like and is what I&rsquo;m currently favoring but need reassurance on unless there is something much better)</p>
<p>I need to have my stationery printed and want something that satisfies web, business cards and letterhead as I&rsquo;d like it to be consistent.</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefully received (ps. early draft of website is at <a href="http://www.bedouintravel.com">www.bedouintravel.com</a>)</p>
<p>Thanks
Saqib</p>
