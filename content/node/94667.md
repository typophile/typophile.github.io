  body: "I <em>have</em> noted in discussions here about Papyrus that, these days,
    typefaces in one language that imitate the look of a different script are unfashionable.
    And, indeed, that is because of \"things like this\".\r\n\r\nHowever, as \"foreign-look\"
    faces go, the one in the photograph is at least <em>understated</em>, and I presume
    it had been chosen (long ago) by Jews themselves.\r\n\r\nSo I don't see a reason
    to condemn or criticize people for celebrating their own culture simply because
    they've done so in a way that doesn't sit well with our <em>current</em> sensitivities.
    I would advise people against the use of foreign-look faces in current projects,
    but that is pragmatic advice - perhaps someday it will be possible to again draw
    the distinction between faces in poor taste and those which, like the one used
    on that hospital, which are sufficiently understated to be a nod to another script
    system rather than tending to give the appearance of being a mockery of it.\r\n\r\nBut,
    more importantly, I think it's very important to draw the distinction between
    \"currently unfashionable\" and \"inherently evil\"... even when one is advising
    people to avoid the former, and even when one recognizes the reasons behind something
    having the former status as legitimate."

    typeface, whereas most faux-Chinese, faux-Arabic, faux-Hebrew and so on faces
    have an amateurish look about them - even when they're in the font catalogue of
    a reputable place like Adobe instead of on dafont.\r\n\r\nI would say though,
    that it <em>is</em> still going to be in the 'currently unfashionable' category
    for many potential users. Use of it by any entity outside the Arabic script community
    to relate material to that community could potentially be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why, in the present climate, so many people play it safe and use Papyrus, making
    it an overused face that many people <em>here</em> love to hate."

  body: "@Maxim Zhukov:\r\n<cite>Do you find this typography politically incorrect?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's
    not what <em>I</em> find politically incorrect, so much as it is what I believe
    others would so find.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing in the first photo of the four you
    included in your post to raise qualms. I think that, in the second, the face in
    which \"Chinese Food\" was set, and in the third, the one in which \"Lin's\",
    as printed on the glass of the window was set, could cause difficulties depending
    on the context.\r\n\r\nYou are right that it isn't really reasonable to complain
    about <em>any</em> of your examples; these are Chinese restaurants, operated by
    Chinese people, and they're using an atmospheric typeface to remind potential
    customers of the nature of their business. But people aren't always reasonable
    these days, and such typefaces can also be used in other contexts for the purpose
    of mockery of the script community in question.\r\n\r\nSo I think that a <strong>national
    chain</strong> of restaurants serving Chinese food, where the outlets aren't necessarily
    owned or staffed by people of Chinese ethnic origins, <em>would</em> avoid this
    category of typeface. Local Mom and Pop restaurants, <strong>fortunately</strong>,
    don't have to (pardon the expression) kowtow to political correctness to the same
    extent."

  body: "Chinese-American and Greek-American restaurants are misleading sample sets,
    I think, when it comes to judging today's typocultural attitudes, because they
    exhibit a graphic 'language' that became conventional decades ago. Discerning
    proprietors and their customers are less likely to reject such conventions out
    of any sense of political correctness than a desperate desire to visually distinguish
    a higher quality dining experience, hence one doesn't see the same conventions
    in Chinese and Greek restaurants that try to offer more authentic and regional-specific
    dishes of the kind that you might actually eat in China or Greece.\r\n\r\n<em>...these
    are Chinese restaurants, operated by Chinese people, and they're using an atmospheric
    typeface to remind potential customers of the nature of their business.</em>\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
    they are signalling to the <em>gweilos</em> that this is a Chinese-American restaurant
    serving a range of dishes that are as predictable in their flavour and price as
    the conventions of the typography. The Chinese customers aren't reading this stuff
    at all, either culturally or literally, any more than they're looking at the English
    language menu. [I had a great experience at a restaurant in Vancouver late one
    night. I arrived with the first half of our party -- a bunch of white guys --
    and we were seated and issued with English menus. A few minutes later the rest
    of our party arrived, including one Chinese guy, and the waiters immediately came
    along and took away our menus and issued us with new, bilingual ones <em>listing

    a more accessible method of indexing Chinese characters for lookup by people unfamiliar
    with the script, and I would recommend the book to people curious about this issue.\r\n\r\n@HVB:\r\n<cite>John,
    can you cite any examples of people or organizations having taken offense at such
    usage?</cite>\r\n\r\nI have to admit I don't have any specific examples in mind.
    I've simply noted the increased use of Papyrus and Ondine, and the decreased use
    of more traditional simulation typefaces, and drawn the conclusion that this is
    likely due to today's climate of increased sensitivity in this area.\r\n\r\nSelf-censorship
    doesn't require a specific incident as a motivator.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all
    simulation typefaces have anything to worry about... for example, I'd say that\r\n\r\n[[http://xuanzhangdesign.com/Akchessima]]\r\n\r\nin
    any context in which it would be likely to be used would not be perceived as potentially
    risking giving offence.\r\n\r\nAnd, given that this thread was started by <em>Hrant
    Papazian</em>, one could muddy the waters a bit more by noting double standards.\r\n\r\nIt
    has been noted that there is a tendency in today's Armenian type design scene
    towards faces which adopt norms of X-height and serif structure carried over from
    Latin typefaces. These faces aren't used as display faces either to evoke or mock
    the Latin alphabet world, they're used as primary text typefaces for the Armenian
    language.\r\n\r\nSo, here, despite the apparent double standard, it makes sense
    to cast the Armenian script community as the victim rather than the perpetrator
    - having the distinctiveness of their own typography smothered by the dominance
    of the Latin alphabet.\r\n\r\n(And the situation is complicated by the fact that,
    as Hrant has pointed out, Armenia being a small place, and having endured restrictions
    on printing in its own language for much of its history, it needs to be open to
    outside influence, as opposed to being insular and tied to Bolorgir... I presume
    the solution he is hoping for is a fruitful interaction between the homeland and
    the diaspora Armenian communities, which are currently at the two opposite extremes.)"
