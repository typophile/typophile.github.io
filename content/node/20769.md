  so weird?\r\n\r\nIn this example, the spacing between the 1 and 5, the spacing after
  the 5, and the spacing between the 2 and 0 does not seem to be balanced.\r\n\r\nOr
  are you not supposed to use the Expert set together with the regular (the regular
  has lining numbers, of course).\r\n\r\nThanks! max\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/perpetua_number_spacing_3642.jpg]"

  body: I'd guess the spacing is weird because it was poorly done. You might benefit
    from using optical spacing if you are using InDesign.

    same (advanced) width, so that they set neatly in a table. The numeral <em>one</em>,
    usually being quite narrower than the remaining numerals, will always* have more
    space around.\r\n\r\n*unless the font contains <em>fitted</em> numerals."

  body: Oh. So you think these are tabular old style? I guess that makes sense. Ugly,
    but it makes sense. :^>

  body: "Ugly?! Why? People should be allowed to use any kind of numerals (in their
    tables). Having said that, the Pro fonts provide 4 sets of them:\r\n\u2013 Tabular
    Lining (usually the Default Figures)\r\n\u2013 Tabular OldStyle\r\n\u2013 Proportional
    Lining\r\n\u2013 Proportional OldStyle"

    of tabular old-style is ugly. \r\n\r\nEdit: The ugliness is my opinion, obviously.
    But, I think it is incorrect to use Tabular figures in any but where tabular setting
    is needed. "

  body: "Touch\xE9 :)\r\n\r\nYeah, if proportional figures are available, I wouldn't
    use tabular (lining or old-style) for anything other than tables.\r\nAnd yes,
    being an Expert font, it seems odd (and inappropriate) that the figures are tabular."
