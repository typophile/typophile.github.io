  body: I can't really tell from your sample but if it's rendered in 3D. If it is,
    I think it's likely that it was custom designed in the 3D modelling software as
    the stroke widths of A seem odd.

  body: This is from a TV series that began airing in 1978. I seriously doubt that
    they used 3D modeling software for something like this. More likely this was hand
    drawn and based loosely on Pioneer.

  body: "1978.. that's before my time! Mark, you're probably right that it is hand
    drawn.\r\n\r\nBTW, I purchased your Refrigerator family a while back and yesterday
    I realised I had lost it again in a recent crash and I was too embarrassed to
    ask you for another copy again. But somehow I figured out the 'extended download
    service' that I paid at an extra cost and got the backed up copy! So that service
    works well. :^)"

  body: Geoff, glad to hear it. I usually only hear when something goes wrong (which,
    thankfully, is not that often). :-)

  body: "I actually designed a book on Taxi way back in the '80s when it was still
    on TV. I had to recreate that type with an enlarged stat and a rapidograph. I
    also had to draw the \"checkers\" border by hand, imagine. But the strangest part
    was that I needed a to draw a checker cab icon but had no reference (long long
    before google) and looked out my office window and there was one stopped at a
    light right across the street. It was one of maybe 4 or 5 still running at that
    time. Did a quick sketch right then and there.\r\n\r\nYoung designers don't know
    how easy they have it. "
