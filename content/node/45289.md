body: "I have been working as an IxD on enterprise level software for one of the largest
  IT companies in the world and am finally going to force a design decision through
  all our software and need some feedback from the experts.\r\n\r\nOur software is
  mostly of the legacy desktop variety, with a few web and mobile applications. We
  are working on a strategy for combining all our UI's into a common technology, but
  have yet to make a firm decision (Java, WPF, or AIR, I am familiar with all). All
  of our technology is moving towards RIA's. But I may be working with all the UI
  technologies under the sun for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nUp until now, we have
  avoided this issue by using system fonts. All users are on XP or Vista, so until
  I came on board, all our apps were using MS Sans and MS Serif, for the most part.
  System fonts. I want to use better screen fonts that are non-system. I am not talking
  display graphics here, I am talking about embedded app fonts.\r\n\r\nMy old boss,
  Stefan Kjartansson is a serious typographer, and he instilled in me a serious respect
  for font licensing, so I want some serious answers here.\r\n\r\nWith Flash and Silverlight
  (and Proce55ing), you have the ability to download font outlines remotely, and then
  remove them after the user exits the application. Fine for the free and open web,
  and emergent free, open source productivity tools in AIR etc.(37 signals manages
  to make money somehow) But it doesn't work with propritory RIA's where the primary
  modality is offline use. And actually, I have a big issue with the enabling web
  technology that allows designers to skirt font licensing, but that's another topic.\r\n\r\nI
  know some guys I worked with at TATA that have been doing Flash e-learning apps
  for the last 8 years or so just never implement designs with non-system fonts because
  they already went through a licensing process and couldn't work out a deal, supposedly.
  The fonts have to be part of the end user install. I just don't take that at face
  value.  Since we also have SOA apps, we no longer have engineers going on site to
  install our software. Users can download and install apps based on their licensing
  agreement with our company.\r\n\r\nSo our company has hundreds of licensing models
  that are of the 100 page TPS report style. I am not sure how to even put a proposal
  together for a font house as I am going to have to get our lawyers involved due
  to the complexity.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n1) Has anyone successfully licensed and implemented
  a non-system font into enterprise software (multi-lingual) with WPF, AIR, Nimbus?
  I have done it in web and chat apps, want to get feedback from enterprise folks.\r\n2)
  What were your challenges? What worked for you? How did you approach the font houses?\r\n3)
  If any font house reps come on here, what is your stance on all of this? Am I just
  way off on this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAnd Sorry for the long post! I just didn't
  see anything in the forumns on this.   "

  body: "1) me!\r\n\r\n2) Educating font vendors as to how these technologies work
    can be painful, especially when the font vendor primarily supplies fonts to graphic
    designers. Add to this the technical challenges around character sets, OpenType
    and hinting and the field narrows. \r\n\r\nSo my advice (and people will criticize
    me for this) is to talk to vendors who understand the technology - so that would
    be Ascender, Monotype, Font Bureau, maybe Bitstream & H&FJ.   \r\n\r\nSecond piece
    of advice would be to go custom - own the font/s outright (not necessarily exclusively)
    and you can avoid future licensing issues as technology and your plans change.\r\n"

    "Release" forum. Oh well.
