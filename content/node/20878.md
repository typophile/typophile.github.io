body: "I'm interning these days and currently that means learning Flash, alas. I've
  always like Unibody 8 from Underware and followed the instructions to use it in
  Flash exactly. I placed the text on full pixels, turned of anti-aliasing, set it
  to 8px, and increased the leading past the default. However, the tops of full height
  characters are being lopped off. This is most noticable on the lc \"f\" and the
  continued absence of the dot over the \"i\". The SC work fine, so I think it is
  only the one pixel getting chopped off. Has anyone else ever encountered this?\r\nThanks."

  body: I know this may sound basic, but have you tried actually generating the movie,
    not just watching the preview window? I find that the preview window can be often
    incorrect where the actual movie is just fine.

  body: Yeah, I have, but good call. The text, even with anti-aliasing disabled, looks
    badly anti-aliased in the preview but fine in the movie <strong>except that</strong>
    the top pixel is missing in both. Weird.

  body: I tried adjusting the baseline shift to no avail. I wonder if it only happens
    on this computer? I'll send myself a copy and look at it at home. If anyone else
    has encountered this, please let me know how you solved it.

  body: "I just tried out, and it's quite simple to fix this problem.\r\nAs odd as
    it might sound, you'll need to select \"Anti-alias for animation\" as the Font
    rendering method, instead of \"Bitmap text (no anti-alias)\"."

    I wonder if it is a bug in the font or in Flash 8?"

  body: "> <em>I wonder if it is a bug in the font or in Flash 8?</em>\r\n\r\nNeither,
    I'd say. Unlike previous versions, Flash 8 offers additional Font Rendering methods.
    The way these new options were worded was probably unfortunate, as they're not
    quite intuitive. I guess that's the problem."

    that it really is a Tiger-specific problem with all later versions of Flash (since
    Flash MX 2004)\r\nUnder Panther there were no problems at all and under Leopard
    it works also good."
