<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to a windows machine, and need some clarifications on the need for digital signatures for fonts to work correctly in some versions of windows.</p>
<p>My understanding is that it is necessary for a DSIG table to be present for windows to recognise OpenType fonts. However, some sites have suggested that this is only necessary for .ttf files. If I am generating CFF-flavoured fonts with an .otf extension, can I safely dispense with this table and still have the font work in a windows environment?</p>
<p>If the answer to the above question is &lsquo;no&rsquo;, will inserting a zero-length DSIG table using TTX suffice, or do I need to include some dummy data in the table?</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know why microsoft imposes this weird restriction on opentype fonts?</p>
<p>TIA,
André</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

It looks like font works. Font can be installed, works in Corel 12, WordPad and ID5. Not sure about &ldquo;safely&rdquo;.

<p>I saw this mentioned on the web. I <em>tested</em> it. On TT-flavoured fonts, the OT icon appeared only on fonts with a DSIG. To me, this indicated that what I stated above. If they didn&rsquo;t have a DSIG, WinXP showed them to be plain old TrueType.</p>
<p>As it happens, the difference between a TrueType font and a TT-flavoured OpenType font is pretty damn small. The OT font has some OT tables and a different version setting, and that&rsquo;s about it. So why would WinXP latch onto the DSIG as an indicator? Beats all hell outta me.</p>

<dl><dd>At the beginning of this section, I referred to the DSIG table as a 'required' table. In fact, a digital signature is not required in the same sense that the CMAP and many other tables are required simply for the font to work. A font without a DSIG table will work, but it will not be recognized as an OpenType font by the Windows operating system. Because the OpenType format is an extension of the TrueType format, and most of the new tables are optional, Windows makes a distinction between the two formats based solely on the presence or absence of a DSIG table. A font with a DSIG table will be recorded in the Windows font folder as an OpenType font and presented with the OpenType icon.</dd></dl>
Ok, it is old, 2001, but still there.

<p>Well, when it was introduced at a MS / Adobe event in the mid-90s, it was postured as protection for font vendors. Through discussion, however, it was determined to actually be protection for users from dangerous fonts. At the time, MS expressed the desire for all documents, and all other content running on or through windows to have a digital signature, and fonts seemed like the perfect place to start.</p>

<p>The issue for Windows in determining what constitutes an OpenType font, as distinct from a TrueType font, inititally for cosmetic purposes (icon presentation) and legal purposes (trademark), was confused by the fact that all the OpenType Layout tables are optional, and all the common sfnt tables needed to be backwards compatible. So Microsoft decided to define a TTF-flavour OpenType font as an sfnt with a OT DSIG table. It&rsquo;s an odd decision that has confused people ever since, including, apparently, the Word 2010 programmers.</p>

<p>Dipped a bit into both Apple and MS TT/OT specs to brush up on OS2Version. Unless I&rsquo;ve branched to Atlantis, 0 is Apple TrueType, 1 is MS TrueType and 2-up are OpenType. And I used to think there was nowt as queer as folk.</p>

<p>No idea what you are talking about.
What&rsquo;s a General Comment and how many font formats have a dsig as a format Identifier.</p>
