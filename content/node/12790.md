  body: "Johanna, Frutiger 55 is just fine when creating .jpg, .gif, and .png graphics
    in Photoshop/Fireworks/etc. for \"text-as-image\" use on websites. Years ago,
    when I was doing more web design, I used a lot of Frutiger (although I tended
    more toward Frutiger 65 Bold, all caps, lots of space\u2026).\r\n\r\nIf you are
    building a website in Flash, you may be better off using the sort of fonts that
    Hrant is talking about for your text. If you haven't used any pixel fonts before,
    you can try out Unibody first (free download from Underware). If you don't like
    it, or want something more exclusive, take a look at Hrant's work (mentioned above).\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "The Ultrafonts stuff works in Photoshop too (with the same advantages*).
    As for a free trial, Unibody is great, but it's not grayscale; I think Ultrafonts
    still offers a freebie (although I think it might not be as \"pushy\" of the technology
    as something like Mana).\r\n\r\n* Including one I just realized recently: in a
    composition that has both small and large text (i.e. most compositions), the latter
    is almost guaranteed to be anti-aliased, and when the former is also anti-aliased
    you get a more harmonious page; next to large anti-aliased text, 1-bit text seems
    <strong>too</strong> crisp to me (I mean aesthetically, ignoring its additional
    functional drawback).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Using fonts in graphics or in Flash files on the web gives you a lot of typographic
    control. For regular searchable and selectable text you'll want to make a stylesheet
    rule that specifies fonts that may be on the users computer. Because you can't
    know this in advance then you need to guess so if you want some nice sans-serif
    you go:\r\n\r\nfont-family: Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; \r\n\r\nEssentially the
    rule of thumb is to familiarize yourself with Microsoft's core web fonts (Favourites
    seem to be Verdana and Georgia.) which are installed on Windows and any Mac with
    Internet Explorer and also other popular fonts on other platforms with something
    like <a href=\"http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/index.shtml\">this</a>.\r\n\r\nIn
    this respect you need to be flexible. Make your font selection list a set of choices
    from most preferred to least. Users don't all have the same fonts as you. My <a
    href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/jon_whipple/\">website</a> specifies <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/inuse.html\">Locator</a>
    (by fellow Typophile Eric Olson), which there is a good chance in the grand scheme
    of things that you don't own. So just in case I also specified Verdana, and Trebuchet
    and if those aren't available use whatever sans-serif the browser knows about.
    It's in my stylesheet <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/jon_whipple/xen.css\">here</a>.
    \r\n\r\nAlso in addition to font suggestions that Hrant and Dan suggested, experiment
    with the anti-alias settings for text in your image editing program. In many cases
    the default isn't the best choice for clarity and there is a better choice, and
    chances are the auto anti aliasing can't match the human touch in the custom greyscale
    bitmap fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope any of this is useful...\r\n\r\nJon"
