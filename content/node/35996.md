  body: "I like the direction your going in with the silhouettes of children. I also
    like the font used. Just an idea, but what if the children made up tree branches
    and leaves or the children playing around/on the tree or maybe a kid(s) on a tire
    swing? A graphic approach, not as animated as clothes hanging on the three. I
    would also narrow down your color seletion on this logo and include the 'children's
    boutique' tag.\r\n\r\nhola!"

  body: "I think you need a typeface more reminiscent of children's books. I would
    probably find something used widely the 19th Century, like Baskerville for example.
    This, I think, would make for a softer, more sentimental mark. I've always found
    design related to children to be most lasting when it emphasizes charm and sweetness
    rather than fun and playfulness. Fun and playful graphics and type tend to have
    a very short shelf-life and that doesn't make for good brand-building.\r\n\r\nHere
    I used Baskerville 10 along with some included ornaments, though if I were designing
    this logo, I would probably draw some ornaments of my own that are a little less
    formal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mulberry_3619.gif]"

  body: "My favourite is by far the one written in blue with the tree. On the other
    hand, I am not certain for the long string of children with lots of colors. I
    would not put them. Otherwise, I would go simpler with less colors and less children.\r\n\r\nFor
    the others, the mixture of two types sans serif is not happy. You should remain
    with the same one but in another grease or choose another type with serif which
    mixes well. The stroke of the bunch of berries is also too much black and bold.
    It clashes much as a whole.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would not use the clothesline.
    That recalls too much at laundry days, which is not especially an exciting activity.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    they are very good ideas and a very interesting project. I hope to see the final
    result.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nalainch"

  body: "What kind of demographic you aiming for? \r\n\r\nOf what you've drawn, the
    tree logos are less logos and more illustrations. That's not necessarily bad,
    but does greatly restrict how/where they can be used. I'm with alainch and I think
    the blue-type option is the best of the lot. I'd suggest not even having the children
    to simplify the mark.\r\n\r\nFisheye's suggestion definitely takes the vibe into
    a more upscale target. Perhaps something like that combined with an etching-type
    illustration of an actual mulberry bush might be something worth trying.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's rather hard to make an opinion on the upper logos, because they are
    too close to each other and without any order.\r\n\r\nBut on my second look I
    wouldn't go with any. Maybe the one with kids, but it should be heavily changed.
    The one with circles/bubbles/mulberries(?) doesn't imply on anything.\r\n\r\nI
    like fisheye's idea but it may be a bit too adult. If the demographics are rich
    people, than even this could work.\r\n\r\nBut be very careful about the logo detail.
    Remember that this logo will probably have to be stitched on clothing etc. and
    you have to keep that in mind too.\r\n\r\nThe tree on the logo with kids is the
    only mark that could possibly be used as a logo in the forms you've presented."

  body: "Yes, I was definitely operating under the assumption that it's an upscale
    children's store.\r\n\r\nI think if the shop is not upscale, you might reconsider
    using the word \"boutique.\""

  body: "I think the sihouette of the tree / bush in a mulberry colour would work
    well. Try centering the type under the tree. I would also avoid that blue in the
    type. Fisheye's solution is quite elegant and current.\r\n\r\nLuke."
