  body: Well there is SPRING out on Agfa-Monotype Font Family &#40;2 styles&#41;,
    and there is SPRING LP, the Adobe Font Family &#40;1 style only&#41; - what is
    the difference?

  body: They are both LetterPerfect fonts. Adobe just had the single weight, Agfa
    has  both weights. As you know Adobe and Agfa often sell fonts that originate
    in other foundries. It&#39;s possible LetterPerfect also sells the same fonts.
    In fact, they do, as <a href="http://www.letterspace.com/LETTERPERFECT_FONTS/spring.htm"
    target="_blank">this page </a>shows. They sell both weights too.
