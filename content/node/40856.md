body: "Hey\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anybody knows of a really good book to help to
  identify fonts. I'm not the greatest at remember the font names yet or the little
  characteristics that set them apart from other fonts so I'm in search of a book
  to help me out. I know that I've seen books like this before but I've searched chapters
  already and came up empty handed.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChris"

  body: At the risk of self-promo, there is no more complete book than [[FontBook]].
    The "see also" cross-references are particularly helpful for identification. If
    you know the name of a font that looks similar, you may find what you seek in
    the cross-reference. I use it daily.

  body: I'll second Stewf's recommendation. <a href="http://currentconfig.com/archives/000235.html">Here's
    a little write-up I did</a> if you're looking for some info. FontBook is a must-have
    if you're serious about type and need a comprehensive reference.

  body: <em>American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century</em> (Matt McGrew, Oak
    Knoll) is brilliant, because it shows complete alphabets and has a brief history
    of each face (designer, foundry, date, distinguishing features etc.) which helps
    you remember. Almost all the faces in it are available digitally, so it still
    has a lot of currency.

  body: "Thanks everyone for your help. I think i'm going to start off with getting
    \"fontbook\" and see where I go from there if I get anything else. I ended up
    finding an old adobe book of fonts at my current workplace \"Derksen Printers,
    Steinbach\" which helped me out for the moment, but FontBook will still be needed.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nChris"

    2, and 3, and Font Bureau, have hard-cover catalogs.\r\nHouse Industries and H&F-J
    publish beautiful specimens, and Veer too.\r\nGo to TypeCon and/or ATypI -- there
    are lots of specimens in the goody bag, some of them very rare and beautiful,
    such as those by Adobe for Garamond Premier Pro."
