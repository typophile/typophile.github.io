body: "Our new Mashq font family, possibly the first typeface implementation ever
  of the early Quranic scripts of the Early Mashq, Mashq Kufi, and Mashq Ma'il, is
  now available.  The font family design is primarily based on the scripts of the
  Quran manuscripts of  the Topkapi Museum, the Bergstraesser Archive, and other scattered
  samples.  Early vocalization (harakat) and Tashkeel (niqat) are fully implemented.
  \ The variant shapes of the letter families of Yaa', Haa', and their ligatures are
  \ also implemented, but their baseline shifts are only implemented for initial and
  final positions in the early Mashq.\r\n\r\nBrowse images and try the font at: http://bit.ly/2icThU9

    fascinated with this script\r\nI was allowed to study closely a 7th. c. Koran
    in this script (see attached photo)and had  enlargements of the waw \u0648 ordered,
    but to this day I wonder how the calligraphers created that tiny counter for this
    and other letters- it was written with multiple passes of the pen, but how?\r\nAnyway
    seeing Saad's fonts reminds me so much of the beauty of the original script. He
    \ caught its noble spirit, neatness, and economy of form. Inevitably however the
    mechanical reproduction makes the page look too\r\nslick when compared to the
    slight variations between letters in the handwritten originals, but that cannot
    be helped! Congratulations!"

  body: "Dear Vladimir, Thanks.  Your photo is showing fine.  \r\nThe beautiful sample
    you posted is Mashq in its later mature stages, borrowing from its Kufi style.
    \ A wonderful Iranian Calligrapher, Seyed Vahid Mousavi Jazayeri, worked very
    hard in the past two decades to revive this calligraphy, giving many workshops
    and producing master pieces. He discovered the exact Qalam angle cut used.  You
    can see his work on the kuficpedia.org site.   You should join our group!\r\n\r\nIn
    my font I was more concerned with the various Mashq scripts. Both the the original
    Mashq and its Kufi version were unstable for a while, it seems. Original Mashq
    had three baseline levels triggered by the Haa' group, and one shape for Yaa'
    (see sample1).  Kufi eliminated that, eventually, and introduced three styles
    of Yaa' but maintained one baseline level for most.  Mashq lived for a while side
    by side Kufi, borrowing from it, as it is seen from the \"battah\"  Yaa' shape
    in the sample you uploaded.  In Sample 2 and 3 (early Kufi) the Haa' ligatures
    are mainly in initial positions to maintain one baseline. Notice medial Haa'.
    This is the style I adopted in my Mashq Kufi font. \r\n"

  body: "Saad,\r\nI always love your work and its inspiration, its going to historical
    roots and/or experimenting.\r\nI never used the Sabine Irsal and Mutamathil Taqlidi
    weights I licensed in 2008 because I never had the occasion to have a text typeset
    in Arabic (and I stopped upgrading to InDesign ME too, for the same reason).\r\nSo
    happy to meet you once again! (Vladimir just told me the Typophile forums were
    back online).\r\n\r\nNot having enough familiarity with the forms, may I ask:
    there are some letters whose curves do not look much armonized: did you strive
    to keep as close to the manuscript forms, instead of \"redesigning\" the letters
    in a more structured way? Anyway, I appreciate a lot your approach, and most of
    your typefaces. All the best!"

  body: "Dear Claudio, \r\nI am glad our group is back. Happy to meet you again, and
    thank you for your encouraging words. My main goal in designing this family was
    to make it easy for many to learn reading the Early Mashq/Kufic scripts.  Despite
    the extreme importance of these scripts, since they were the first Arabic calligraphic
    styles introduced, I could not find fonts available for them. It should be noted,
    most Arabic readers are unable to read these scripts.  In fact, I have seen works
    by some calligraphy experts mixing up Early Mashq with the derived Early Kufic!
    \ In this project, I concentrated more on the script rules and early vocalization
    (Tanqits) than on the beautiful calligraphic quality of these styles, which could
    only be seen much later after the two styles matured.  Yes, I wanted the font
    to look and behave as much as possible like the very early scripts seen in the
    Quran manuscripts displayed in the Museums. Since this was a ground-breaking font
    design project, I had to revisit some of the common logic employed today in producing
    Arabic OTF fonts, to make sure the font would be compatible with current Arabic
    keyboard and the Unicode Arabic alphabet.\r\n-Saad   "
