  body: As far as I know, OpenOffice doesn't support OpenType features, and the newest
    version of Word does support them to some extent. Is that the type of font usage
    problem you're wondering about?

    could be fiksed for OpenOffice since it is open source."

  body: Yup, OpenOffice is fairly awful for typography. Bad OpenType support, no ligatures,
    no true small caps... and the developers are quite snarky about implementing what
    would be a fairly straightforward feature.

  body: "Supporting OpenType features may require a lot of programming, and, of course,
    since it's open source, it's not as if money coming in supports it.\r\n\r\nBut
    if OpenType support is not trivial - so that even, say, WordPad would fully support
    all OpenType features - then it may be reasonably asked whether the features in
    OpenType are really useful to people. If a font can \"do fancy things\", then
    it ought to be possible to make it do those things <em>everywhere the font is
    used</em>.\r\n\r\nWhich means that the mechanism currently used to get at things
    like variant characters, small caps, and so on and so forth, is deeply flawed.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"right\" way for a font to behave on a computer, \"of course\" (and I realize
    what I'm proposing won't happen, since it's wildly impractical for many reasons)
    is for it to be simple and intuitive to control all its features, i.e. requesting
    a long s, disabling ligatures, and so on...\r\n\r\nwhen you're generating your

    (6,33)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRITE (6,11)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRITE
    (6,44)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRITE (6,22)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33

    =)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 FORMAT (53HA word like official is printed with the
    ligature ffi)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44 FORMAT (18H*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22

    123456789 123456789 123456789 12\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nassuming that * as a printer
    control character indicates a line containing font behavior characters, and in
    such a line, = means \"force ligature\" and - means \"prohibit ligature\"."

    would require a font designer experience.  Nonetheless I will try and hope it
    is comprehensible:\r\n\r\nLayout at existing document (ODF) on OpenOffice - The
    document is stored on the PC, when I reopened it after a while, a text block was
    mostly invisible.  After changing font size other than 11 to 11.6 it became visible
    or when font was changed.  When I put 11.7 as font size, the wordprocessor jumped
    to 11.6 and was visible.\r\n\r\nLayout on PDF on OpenOffice -  After a document
    is converted to PDF some very few documents became semi-garbled.\r\n\r\nLayout
    at ODF on OpenOffice -  Some very few documents are not able to accept a preferred
    layout again - line / words jump (could be due to header/footer or mix with another
    font?)\r\n\r\nThe font is not available in smaller sizes up to 9.  When font is
    put as 9, the text area frame becomes larger, shifting the total document area.\r\n\r\nIs

    don't see the problem at all. Small-caps aren't hardcoded into the document, they
    are stored as an argument of the respective style tag in the ODT's XML files (<code>fo:font-variant=\"small-caps\"</code>
    in OO; I would imagine Word handles it simliarly). If the font provides real small
    caps, real small caps are displayed in the software. If it doesn't, scaled-down
    caps are displayed in their place.\r\n\r\nIf users are stupid enough to hard-format
    small caps themselves, they won't be affected at all.* Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\n*I
    admit I have a hard time not ranting about the fact that word processors allow
    people to hard-format stuff at all ..."

  body: OpenOffice's main font problem is that it can't use OT features. OTF fonts
    weren't even supported at all until 3.0 and couldn't be printed or used in PDF
    export until 3.3, when they finally got support, but only for basic Type 1-level
    functionality.

  body: Symphony is based on the OO 1.x codebase, so it's a wash. LibreOffice is still
    basically identical to OO, so it's identically useless (no ligatures, no small
    caps, no alternates, etc) and StarOffice is just OpenOffice with some extra import/export
    filters licensed from a commercial vendor.
