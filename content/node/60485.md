  is any way to understand all that \u201Cchinese\u201D code input for OpenType features.
  Spending a day to understand how to \u201Cignore a substitute\u201D (from FontLab
  manual) but nothing!!! Any help for the complete idiot?\r\n\r\nKonstantinos Siskakis\r\nAnagrafi\r\nGreece\r\n"

  body: The logic for "ignore" can be confusing. It's best to think of it as a filter
    that excludes things. Or as an "if not" statement.

  body: "Since FontLab uses the AFDKO, the Adobe site is a good resource (IIRC, the
    FontLab manual <em>does</em> mention a few deviations). Your ignore line can be
    found here:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.f.ii|Specifying
    exceptions to the Chain Sub rule]]\r\n\r\nThe most confusing part of it is it
    also needs a at least one part tagged with a ' (in regular substitutions this
    marks the to-be-replaced glyph(s))."

  body: "Speaking of those 'ignore sub' statements: Within any lookup in a features
    file (which often means within a feature, unless you've specified lookups within
    a feature), scanning stops at the first match. So, in OpenType layout, if 'sub
    f i by f_i' matches, then that substitution is made, and everything in the lookup
    after that is ignored/skipped. The 'ignore sub' statements function exactly like
    any other 'sub' statement in this regard, except that instead of performing a
    substitution, nothing is done.\r\n\r\nSo, the statement 'ignore sub x f' i' by
    f_i' can be read as \"if f and i is preceded by x, do nothing.\" This is a match,
    like everything else, and subsequent lines in the lookup are skipped.\r\n\r\nDon't
    know if that actually helps! :)"

    from the the pop-up menu at the bottom with the gear icon. If the text is set
