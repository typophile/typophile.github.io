body: "Hi,\r\nI'm looking for a (very) user-friendly Metafont editor for Windows.
  I know Miktex, WinEdit... but I'm wondering if there is something more 'immediate',
  with a more fast preview function, for example. Yes, I know I'm not very clear,
  but can you help me? Thanks a lot.\r\nj "

  body: "notjoe \u2014 What are you precisely looking for? A code editor with syntax
    highlighting, a script to automate previews or a true WYSIWYG GUI? I'm afraid,
    syntax highlighting is the best you'll find.\r\n\r\nYou might want to contact
    the developers of <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METATYPE1\">MetaType</a>.\r\nAlso
    have a look at <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29008\">this thread</a>."

    body: "thanks for your reply. \r\nI suppose I'm looking for a WYSIWYG GUI, but
      all the things you told me are really interesting. In particular, what do you
      mean for 'syntax highlighting'?? \r\nThanks again.\r\nj\r\n"

  body: '"syntax highlighting" makes a text editor recognise the code of a particular
    programming language (i.c. METAFONT) while you''re typing. This reduces the risk
    for typos and other mistakes that will have the interpreter misunderstand your
    program. Just look for a plug-in and add it to the editor of your choice: erroneous
    code will not be highlighted, whereas valid code will be hightlighted according
    to the syntax.  '

  body: "Notjoe, \r\n\r\nare you really looking for an editor for Metafont, or for
    TeX in general? If you're looking for TeX, WinEdit is among the best you can get,
    but there is also LyX, which is more WYSIWYG but more limited functionality-wise.
