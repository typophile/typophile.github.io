body: I have this scan of a picture, of a shirt with the lettering I need (see attached).
  I have run it through FMF but no luck. Any assistance would be appreciated[img:sites/default/files/old-images/southwind_6286.png]

  body: well, it is pretty awful. in many ways. looks like someone could have taken
    a marker and just made a bunch of straight letters, then connected them with lines
    for some sort of faux scripted effect.

  body: The ways that the letters connect suggest it wasn't ever a font.

  body: "Many casual scripts look awful, but have their own appeal for some purposes.
    Think of -- using the pre-digital names-- Choc, Mistral, Signal, Reporter (Gong),
    Pepita etc. \r\nAs for the ways that the letters connect in the image this would
    require OT features that allow the choice of \"top\" or \"middle\" joins between
    charcters.\r\nConsider the following using Nick Shinn's Handsome Pro\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/handsome-pro/\r\nThe
    letterforms are more rounded than in the image, but you can see how the connections
    work.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HandsomePro_5627.jpg]\r\nSome effects,
    such as the overlapped th would require special ligatures.\r\nAnyway, this design
    is probably hand lettering or Photoshop. It does not appeal particularly to me
    as being worth fonting.\r\nDon"

  body: 'Can''t agree more with eliason. Most probably a custom logo work. Loosely
    reminding me of Santa Fe/Kaufmann/Swing and Matinee Idol. May be having a look
    to some similar fonts listed at Identifont is worth of an interest: [[http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=Santa+Fe|Santa

  body: Thank you all. I agree with many of the comments. I was hoping to cut some
    time off the reproduction and not have to scan the shirt by sections and piece
    together. Thanks again for the suggestions.

  body: "Neonoir, suggested by Ryuk, is the closest approximation of the lettering.
    But if your object is to reproduce the shirt rather than to have the ability to
    produce a variety of mottos in this lettering, my opinion is that it would be
    easier for you to scan sections of the shirt and reassemble them, rather than
    to modify Neonoir.\r\nGood luck!\r\nDon"
