  body: "Judging from the G, I think this is a Caslon, perhaps [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon-old-face/|Caslon
    Old Face]] that has been widened, distorting the width of the strokes and the
    letters themselves.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of Caslons, but the one I picked might
    be a reasonable guess. Possibly with some added stroke thickness, before the widening.\r\n\r\n-
