  body: Thanks for your thoughts. This is from a sign that is about 10 years old and
    sign people (I am one) altering fonts is not that common anymore. I couldn't even
    find anything similar. The upright stroke in the G and the goofy W are unique
    but that really hasn't helped me much.

  body: I think it is the regular, not the bold; a light color on a dark background
    tends to look bolder than it actually is.
