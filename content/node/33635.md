body: Just FYI, registered members of typophile are allowed to submit news stories.
  There is a link on <a href="news">the news page</a> in the right-hand column that
  allows you do this. However, once you post an item, it is stuck in moderation until
  approved by a moderator. So, after posting news items, please <a href="readme#help">contact
  a moderator</a> to approve your posting for you. Thanks for reading!

  body: "> please contact a moderator to approve your posting\r\n\r\nThis is a discouraging
    bit of overhead.\r\nBy all means do have an approval process for \"news\" items,\r\nbut
    please make it so that a moderator (maybe implement\r\na cycling selection) is
    notified automatically.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The downside of that being is spammers use it. People subscribed to the RSS
    will get the spam regardless of the fact that we might remove it. I do wish we
    were sent an email or something when one goes into moderation. That would be helpful.\r\n"
