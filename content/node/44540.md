  body: "Foremost, like any good typeface, they are designed for the specific use
    and application where they will be deployed. In other words, good screen-based
    UI fonts were not originally designed for wood, metal or for a linotype machine
    decades ago. \r\n\r\nSecond is that they are designed by designers. How many fonts
    in use in the handheld device industry were designed by engineers? I've been very
    encouraged by how much custom type is being commissioned by device manufacturers,
    game companies, console makers, etc. I'm sure Sii could comment here. \r\n\r\nStep
    magazine approached us last year about this topic for an article. Jared Benson
    shared some insights specific to mobile devices that may be worth reviewing. The
    irony with this link is that the article looked much better in print. http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEP/Article/28766"

  body: "You can't look at a printed font and know it will be a good UI font - but
    in some cases you can know it won't be! The goodness of a UI font has to do with
    it's ability - often with the help of programmed \"hints\" to render cleanly from
    6 7 or 8 pixels to maybe 18-30 pts. Sometimes the range is more narrow like 8-18
    pt. You do need special tools and you need to learn about different operating
    systems and how they render fonts. If you are working on the Ui for one device
    then you just need to know about it's rendering model. \r\n\r\n<cite> Um... what
    sort of UI? </cite>\r\n\r\nExactly. A good UI font is often tied closely to it's
    device/OS."

  body: "Thomas hit on the most important consideration. Ultimately a UI font get
    crunched down to a bitmap that shows up on screen. How the outlines get rasterized
    vary significantly from platform to platform. Some of the common rendering engines
    are: ClearType (Windows), Freetype (lots of stuff uses this, including Linux and
    FontLab), Quartz (OS X), iType (Monotype) and Adobe uses custom engines for may
    of their apps. Different Adobe apps use different renderers; Photoshop, Fireworks
    and Flash even allow users to tweak with the parameters of the renderer.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a hearty debate about type rendering engines here: [[http://typophile.com/node/34393]].\r\n\r\nSome
    other points that come to mind: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>UI fonts rarely use italic, or
    even bold for that matter.</li>\r\n<li>UI fonts really need to get out of the
    way. If they are too much they can distract from the task at hand. (Obviously
    there are exceptions here: if we are talking about a UI font for a Barbie fashion
    game, the considerations are completely different, of course.) For a good example
    of a UI font that has some unique character check out the [[http://www.ascendercorp.com/pr/pr2005_10_18.html|XBox
    UI font]] by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corp.</li>\r\n<li>UI fonts are almost
    always sans serif (for now).</li>\r\n<li>UI fonts often use extensive hinting
    tuned to the specific rendering engine, or even the specific display device.</li>\r\n<li>May
    devices don't support outline (TrueType or Postscript) types. There are probably
    thousands of bitmap type rendering engines, as may app and device manufacturers
    create their own engines. They all work pretty much the same way, though.</li>\r\n</ul>"
