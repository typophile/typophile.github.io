This is exactly the sort of site that chafes my hide raw. goodfonts.org is hugely popular, probably the most-bookmarked font site on <a href="http://del.icio.us/search/all?search=fonts">del.icio.us</a> (see "essential fonts") and constantly linked at "design" weblogs as an "awesome resource". Font archives like goodfonts.org that mask themselves as legitimate can deal a significant blow to the industry that underground piracy never can. They turn an uneducated public into unwitting pirates. The notion it breeds: "If I can freely download gobs of professionally made font families from the web, why should I ever pay for a font?"</div>

This is a very good point. We can sway them with guilt, er, I mean by educating them.

I see your point Tiff, and agree that we don't want to steer anyone down the wrong path (the path of evil! «Insert echo here»). However, I believe that there is a benefit to having the URLs posted, at least within discussions such as this (vs a collection of sorts that could potentially act as a resource for free font hunters), as a means of creating awareness – awareness within the type design community and also the general design community, those utilizing the fonts. It is so easy to take advantage of Google for these types of searches and it is probably the first step taken anyway, so I don't see any harm in the link being here.

I suppose I'm trying to keep temptation from out of everyone's path. Which is, of course, in itself a completely unrealistic thing to do. If you are tempted by something and want it badly enough you won't stop looking until the so-called itch has been scratched. So to speak.

As I posted previously I did have second thoughts. But, obviously I didn't pause long enough. It comes down to trust. If we had a wiki full of "evil sites not to visit" would it become a bad thing? Or would it be educational. There isn't a black or white. I know that it would be used for evil and good. Gray is my color today.

For the record, I wasn't the moderator in this instance. I did ask for Mike to remove the URL and didn't intend to remove it. Well, not today anyway. But, I would have done it eventually. 

How can we approach this? Putting it in the uppercase would be like preaching to the converted. Should there be a wiki? A wiki specific to sites that are wide-spread already but that need to be pointed out as bad? 

I am in agreeance. Sorry, my moderator hat was on a little too tight. Let's do something about this.</div>

First. I don't take back my stating that education is important. Very important. 

This topic went to bed with me and haunted my dreams. Call me paranoid. We have had a few ugly instances on Typophile in which I have had to archive and delete entire threads because of threats, veiled and otherwise, from lawyers, as well as to protect friends and other typophiles.

I think we need to make it a habit and a rule of thumb not to post URLs to sites. However, getting the word out to foundries, for warning, can be done through me if need be. Also, if you have a question about a suspicious site, contact one of the moderators. I am personally involved in a private alert group. This is the best way to get sensitive material shared.

So, I guess I am retracting my second retraction. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think some folks in this thread may not understand the ubiquity of the site in question. Far more know about this site than know about Typophile. del.icio.us is a good indicator of a site's popularity and link volume. The fact that its popularity exceeds that of <em>any other font site</em> -- commercial or free -- shows where the the bulk of the web is going for fonts. It's already out there, and already Google PageRanked up the yizzang. The likelihood that those who are apt to use pirated fonts will discover the site through Typophile is very low. They know about it already.

We are being naive if we believe this forum can prevent traffic to the site. What we <em>can</em> do, as a body that cares deeply about the craft and industry, is document the problem and educate the public.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen hit the nail on the head. I personally don't believe that hiding something is the way to solve the problem. You can't simply act like it doesn't exist. There are always legal ramifications in situations like this, and while its best to not "defame" a person's name during a discussion you shouldn't talk about it like its a phantom either. 

To me its no different than telling teens that abstinence is the best choice and expecting them to not have sex. Is that really realistic?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't expect removing the URL from Typophile to stop the traffic on that site. But, it prevents traffic from originating at Typophile. I think discussing the fact that there are sites out there that people  need to avoid is good. Posting the URLs so others, those not so in the know -- even if the numbers are huge already thanks to google -- can't say they found the URL on Typophile. 

Discussion is good. URLs are bad. 

If we mention and continue to mention that there are many illicit sites out there perhaps there can be education even still.

But the point is that if you leave the URL here, then people coming here know of the site *and* know what's wrong with the site.

Now we have this useless thread that doesn't refer to anything specific...how does that benefit anyone?

"Please respect our fears."
