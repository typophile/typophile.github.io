  body: I have looked in Parts 6 and 14 of the Script Font ID Guide. Closest I found
    were &#39;Stanley&#39;, &#39;Le Chat Noir&#39; and &#39;Whoa&#39;. The samples
    are below. Parts 5 and 12 might also be places where I would have put a font like
    this, but I don&#39;t think I have this one yet, so I am looking forward to an
    answer too. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64494.gif"
