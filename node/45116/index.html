		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

Seems a bit silly - it's not in most fonts because most people don't need it - it is in some common system fonts and is generic and rare enough not to worry about a font-specific version (in most cases). 

It's U+2117 - as my screen shot (two posts above) shows.

Not to be too sarcastic, but we're in a bad situation if we depend on the foundry to determine what we (the end user) will need. I suppose when we need characters not in a font, we should just set those in Ariel?

For example, ours is a small shop, but at least once a month, I need characters not in most foundry releases. Not sexy things like swash small caps, but regular Latin characters with non-European diacriticals -- or even just all the combining diacriticals & space modifying characters.

But of course it just isn't practical for every single font to have every plausible character. The aforementioned Hypatia Sans has >3000 glyphs per font. That's not a reasonable level to expect from "all fonts." Not unless you want to see 1/6 as many new fonts being released.

Laugh to self. But when one wants to set p in a circle, one should not have to wait for it to snow at the equator.

re: I put it in the Pi slot like Font Bureau — "um, what does that mean exactly?"

It means that we @ FB understand how users work, and so we put the p in a circle, a "must-have" glyph that is very difficult for a user to make on the fly, in the slot of a glyph (math pi) that most people <em> really don't need </em>(because even if they do,  it's in the symbol font on every single computer on earth).

Considering the fact that there are applications out there now that simply will not allow the inclusion of un-encoded glyphs in the document, we might be forced, by the overwhelming desire to please our users, to keep doing that.

Cheers!</div>

How many people have used the per-thousands symbol or logical not from any font? I think many more people have designed CD packaging that have had to hack their own publish symbol than have used many other "core" characters. But now that no one buys CDs anymore, I suppose is a moot point. 

The metal foundries sold diacritics as generic sorts and did not worry about  font-specific versions. 

We have been putting that character in all P22 fonts for about 10 years (also in the pi slot for TT/PS and unicode for OT). </div>

I think it's a lot easier to uncover why obscure and silly characters are included in character sets and code-pages, than why important characters like (P) are not. It's probably related to these char sets being defined by tech, scientific and banking communities rather than music publishers.

		<div class="commentbody">You're probably on a Mac. But if it is a PC, select the font that has the character -- Ariel Unicode seems to be about the only one. Make sure the *num lock* toggle is on. Hold down the *alt* key, then using the numeric keypad, press *plus* & the digits (2117). If an alpha character is needed (as with *24DF* for the lower-case circled p), use the regular keyboard for the alphas, but the number must be from the keypad. When you've entered the Unicode string, let go of the *alt* key.

According to http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/24df/index.htm you type Alt +24DF but they also say (if you follow the link giving the shortcut which gets you <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/tip/microsoft/enter_unicode.htm" target="_blank">here</a>) that you need to have your numeric keypad set to hexadecimal (HKEY_Current_User/Control Panel/Input Method, set EnableHexNumpad to "1"). Since your examples above (copyright etc) are in decimal, I would try  Alt +9439 (because the number that writes 24DF in hexadecimal notation is nothing but the decimal integer 9439).

That's overreacting. Your market needs a serif and sans available from a system utility like Apple's Type Palette, Letterlike Symbols. Is there something like this in XP?  With only 1% of your market moving by choice to Vista (default CT), I don't think it's helping just to put them in CT fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, you can probably fool around with the size & position in InDesign to get them close, but I think the core of your problem is your insistence on using the lower-case p. The lower-case circled-p (Unicode 24DF) come from a different set, namely, circled alpha characters. There may a circled capital C in that set (U+24__); you could look for it. But the Sound Recording copyright symbol has always been the circled capital P -- Unicode 2117. Now if that is sized differently than the copyright symbol (circled capital C), you'd have a legitimate complaint.</div>

As Charles says, if you want satisfaction, you most probably need to use the character 0x2117 and moreover, if you want everything to be nicely aligned, you need both the copyright and 0x2117  to be taken from the same font (and  also from the font with the + and/or the &). Here are two examples (a grab in Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac).


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elusivecirclep_4802.jpg]

In my opinion, if you don't have a font containing a glyph for 0x2117,  the easiest thing to do is either to buy one or to choose a font whose EULA allows you to modify it and add to it the glyph for 0x2117.

		<div class="commentbody">To tackle the comment "I still don’t know how to access the ⓟ ouside of this cut-and-paste method.": In more recent versions of Word, you can get a character by typing its 4-digit Unicode, er, code and then hitting Alt+X immediately after; so in this case I type 2117 and then hit Alt+X. I'd left the font at the default TNR. Word switched to MS Mincho and dropped in the character. Setting the font to Trebuchet and trying the same thing resulted in Word switching to MS Gothic and dropping in the correct character. Dunno if this helps.
