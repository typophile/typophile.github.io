body: "I am working on a type family and having trouble importing metrics from one
  weight into another. I currently have a regular weight with horrible spacing and
  a properly spaced bold weight. What I want to do is apply the sidebearings of the
  bold weight to the regular weight, narrow them all a little, and then manually tweak
  everything. When I import the metrics of the bold weight, the sidebearings end up
  where they would be in the bold weight, so I\u2019m stretching my advance width
  way out to the right.\r\n\r\nI can work around this by just copy/pasting the sidebearings.
  Is that the best way to do this, or is there a way to import the metrics relative
  to the outlines as opposed to just setting the sidebearings to their actual locations
  in the bold weight?"
