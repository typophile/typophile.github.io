  readily available, but it's not any of the usual suspects. The closest I came to
  was Helv. Neue. Extra Bold Condensed, but still no cigar. It *could* be some custom
  thing made just for these placard signs ... whaddaya think? (and thanks!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign-font_5191.jpg]\r\n\r\nxo,

  body: "There were a lot of Franklin Gothic-like sign painting styles around but
    lettering for signs often gets simplified for older plotters. The newer plotters
    are more able though.\r\nSquooshing sometimes happens with adjustments to plotters
    to fit a certain space.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
