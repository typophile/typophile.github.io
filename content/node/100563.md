  ago I got the typography bug and now it's probably a full blown obsession. As a
  directed study for school, I've selected to create my own typeface. My plan is to
  create roman lower and upper and italics by the end of the semester. One of the
  problems has been finding a process getting good feedback because of the lack of
  people experienced people around me. So I've come here to hopefully learn and get
  good critique.\r\n\r\nMy current plan is to do all the letters on paper with pencil,
  then ink, which will be scanned in to take to a yet undecided program and fixed.
  Is there a standard program that would allow me to do kerning tables and such? I've
  looked into FontLab and Font Forge, but haven't used anything yet. \r\n\r\nSecondly,
  I would like to ask for some feedback on my preliminary letters. I've attached a
  couple images of my first forms. The plan is to create a contemporary serif, with
  a little humanist feel. I've been experimenting also with a very high x-height and
  some features that would be interesting at display size but disappear as body text.
  Please don't hold back!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img002_4296.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img004_3525.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img008_6220.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img006_5928.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img010_4039.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img005_4305.jpg]"

    do is look at the Yellow font by J\xFCrgen Weltin.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Let's just say I'm a type design enthusiast, rather than a type designer.
    So keep that in mind when reading this.\r\n\r\nI attended a week long type design
    workshop recently. What I learned is that although I love handwork, and meticulously
    drawing and inking each letterform at large sizes -- it might not be the best
    workflow to get to a coherent typeface design. Why? Because there's a tendency
    to make each glyph look very nice, but that workflow doesn't allow you to see
    how the glyphs interact with each other at a more regular size, be it 12 pixels
    or 9 points.\r\n\r\nI found that sketching on cheap paper was a way to quickly
    test out shapes. If a shape looks OK, then quickly redraw it in your font editing
    software. If you redraw it without bothering to scan your sketch you might find
    that you quickly become better with bezier curves, and that you can iterate at
    a faster pace. \r\n\r\nThis also means you don't have to spend time drawing every
    glyph perfectly on a larger sheet of paper. You just need to start with some base
    glyphs, space them as well as you can, and then print them out to see if they
    are or are not working together. If you post your tests to typophile you will
    get some good feedback. As it is, these large letterforms you've posted -- they're
    not a typeface. They're just nice drawings.\r\n\r\nSearch this forum for which
    glyphs to start with. It will be something like:\r\n\r\nLowercase:\r\nStart with
    \"o\" an \"n\" then do print tests of \"onononon\" and adjust/correct spacing.\r\nFill
    in the rest of the glyphs in the word \"adhesion.\" This contains most of the
    DNA for the rest of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nUppercase:\r\nHAQR (as, similarly, these
    will contain alot of DNA for the other caps)\r\n\r\nOnce you have a few glyphs
    you can use this tool to generate words:\r\nhttp://www.adhesiontext.com/\r\n\r\nIn
    this way, you are prototyping a typeface design, rather than drawing letters on
    paper. This was a revelation to me, as I admit that I tend to get too precious
    with my drawings, which is a barrier to rapid prototyping and fast improvement.\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\nIf
    you decide to buy Glyphs do not buy it from the Apple App store. I implore you!
    Don't make the mistake I did. Apple is extremely slow at approving software updates
    so those of us who stupidly purchased from the app store are stuck with older
    versions (my version doesn't work well on OS 10.6.8).\r\n\r\nEveryone has a different
    workflow and this one may or may not work for you!"
