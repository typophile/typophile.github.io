  it was a prop of some kind; somehow it looks so modern to my eyes. \r\n\r\nBut no,
  there it is, in the [[http://digital.archives.alabama.gov/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/voices&CISOPTR=2020&CISOBOX=1&REC=6|Alabama
  online state archives]].\r\n\r\nI'm curious about two things: what's the soft serif
  used for \"Paid organizers...\"? Not the Cooper, the lighter text face.\r\n\r\nAnd
  why does it look so computery? (If the answer is that I spend too much time looking
  at a screen and I've simply lost my mind, that's fair.)\r\n\r\nI insert page 2 simply
  for historical completeness. <strong>It is not an endorsement of the messages contained
  in any sense.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen1_6505.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen2_5326.jpg]"
