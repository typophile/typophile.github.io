  it in to be turned in today.  He is not sure what font he used at home and it is
  showing up as gibberish when I open it here at the school in word.  Any help identifying
  the font, or pointing out how to find the correct font would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan"

  body: Maybe try another font installed on your computer then. I was able to see
    the text when I tried it. I can email it to you if you provide an address.
