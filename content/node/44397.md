  Spiekermann Lecture at the BPL]]. I'd checked his blog a bunch of times in the last
  three months, and actually <cite>been</cite> to the BPL about a week before this,
  and somehow stayed oblivious of it. \r\n\r\nI don't think I did anything that night
  either. Depressing. \r\n\r\nEdit: Apparently this is a lecture that happens annually,
  and it was [[http://typophile.com/node/44038|mentioned right here on Typophile]].
  I have no excuse. "

    sorry I missed it too. I'm right at North Station, but I was so swamped with overtime.
    There's always great stuff at the BPL (and ICA too). We need to keep our eyes
    peeled little better i guess."
