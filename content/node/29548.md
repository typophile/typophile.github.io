    body: Slimbach always flopped when I tried it; just too weak. That endstroke atop
      the l/c a just fades in smaller sizes. Try Utopia, very strong for this usage.

    aspects of Gulliver that appeal to you?  Are there specific letters you like?
    Is it the darkness or color of the type on the page? The x-height?\r\n\r\nWhat
    would define 'similar' in your view? (It's a very subjective quality, I find.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Loren, you said you wanted to find something in your own collection that
    was similar to Gulliver. Can you post a list of serif fonts you have, or tell
    us what libraries you are using? It seems pointless for us to try to name 'similar'
    fonts, if we have no idea what you might have. \r\n\r\nFor example, I would say
    that DSType's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/aquila/\">'Aquila'</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/cultura/\">'Cultura'</a> have
    basic letterforms that are similar to Gulliver; and <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_c/collis_roman_full.gif\">'Collis'</a>
    from TEFF is also rather similar in weight and letter shapes; or <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_fg/fedra_serif_b_full.gif\">'Fedra
    Serif B'</a> is visually similar looking on a page and has a wide range of weights.
    \r\n\r\nDo you have any of those?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    (although I fear it's price is out of range of most mere mortals.
