  body: riccardo, I understand you may be wanting to simply let the readers know that
    discussion has already taken place about this here, and where to find it if they
    want. But I wonder if your constant reposting of links to old threads really doesn't
    have the effect of lessening the conversation around here.  I suppose you view
    Typophile as a kind of encylopedia, where once something has been discussed it
    not need ever be again, but I myself view typophile as a kind of water cooler
    in a type design office.  No offense is meant here, but I believe the more discussion
    we can have here the better, and your posting of links to older threads really
    has the effect of making people think there is nothing more to be said.  Just
    my $0.02.

    to simply focus the discussion where it had once started, not least because anybody
    who had participated there is more likely to notice the revival.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I am glad older threads are mentioned. It is good to see the changes that
    have taken place between the different dates.  I don't think conversation is squelched
    by giving readers a chance to see prior discussions.

  body: Yeah, the link to me doesn't say "we don't need to talk about this anymore,"
    but rather, "here's a place where the conversation you want to start is already
    happening--join them!"

    many things could be say about Typophile, but not that it\u2019s about any vast
    majority! ;-)\r\nAnyway, my linking is just a way to add some context to the conversation.
    \r\nAnd revived old threads are cool.\r\nBy the way, thanks for providing a new
    working link to the document."

  body: Reviving a dead thread is a lesser evil than starting a new one with no acknowledgement
    of the old one, IMO.
