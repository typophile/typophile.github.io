  really appreciate your feedback on this. i started with syndikat as my school project
  couple of years ago. it was planned to be a caps-only display typeface, but it stayed
  untouched on my disk for a long time. recently i decided to get back to it and i
  redrew all the caps and got some ideas for lowercase as well. i quickly drew these
  semiangular-semismooth letters and i think they work quite well. i almost completed
  the thin and the heavy extremes and i'd like to interpolate three styles in between.
  syndikat will have the standard character set of a text faces with small caps, maybe
  special initial caps, few set of figures and so on, but its function should be primarily
  display.\r\nwhat do you think? \r\nthanks, ondrej"

    the tapering from it, so the second lightest style will be interpolated completely
    without it, and only the second heaviest will keep the reduced tapering. '

    the angles you've chosen for the bowls (for ex. a, g) are rather nice. I like
    the bolder weights more.\r\n\r\nI'd consider rounding the outside corners of the
    sharp-angled letters like N,W, etc."
