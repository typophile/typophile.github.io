body: "So, I keep seeing different price notations on posters at the metro stations
  and they often frustrate me. Now I just want to verify that there is logic behind
  my frustrations, in that I want to verify whether the other notations are simply
  incorrect or perhaps the rules to the notations differ per country, but I suppose
  all the same I shouldn't be seeing different notations in the same country. Here's
  an image to illustrate the different things I've seen:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Price
  notation_5993.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe first notation frustrates me because a hyphen is used,
  the second frustrates me even more because the hyphen is spaced in such a way that
  from a distance it looks like a semicolon; the third is correct and the fourth frustrates
  me because I just don't understand why the dash needs to be spaced over the comma.
  I suppose it's not necessarily a rational objection but an emotional one."

    Einstein might call it spooky action.

  body: The third is correct, yep. Never seen the kerned ones before. Somebody wanted
    to save space there. Hyphen is defintely wrong.

  body: "Maybe it's an issue of not understanding the history of the notation? As
    a child, it took me ages to realise that the Swedish equivalent of this (75:\u2013)
    was a shorthand for 75:00, and I'm guessing it's even more opaque now that the
    subdivisions of the krona no longer come in coins.\r\n\r\nAm I wrong to think
    it's sort of exciting, the different variants? Hand drawn shorthands are, after
    all, the source of a lot of interesting symbols, not least the amersand; I can
    well imagine the last variant turning into a ligature at some point, especially
    as subdivisions grow rarer with inflation."

    many hyphens used inappropriately."

  body: "Traditionally, an em dash (or two en dashes) was used to replace zeros in
    printed price lists:\r\n10,\u2014 for 10,00\r\n\u2014,90 for\_ 0,90\r\nIn metal
    fonts, (tabular) figures typically were half an em in width.\r\n\r\nJ\xFCrgen
    is right in that the modern (German) practice uses en dashes. Price notation styles
    are different from country to country, though. See also <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=pricenotation&sort=relevance&user_id=52362783%40N00\">these

  body: Why they use hyphens is pretty obvious (http://twitter.com/baldcondensed/status/525631405251125248),
    but I think Florian's images shed a light on the origin of the kerned comma/dash
    pair too.

    put an apostrophe for a genitive where there is no genitive at all. If there is
    a shop sign with a name ending with s they put an apostrophy (if they\u2019re
    lucky \u2013most of the times they use ' or \xB4."
