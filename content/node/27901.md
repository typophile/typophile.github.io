  pages. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a way to use both languages in the same document?!
  According to Adobe you can only use one of these languages at a time as they require
  different versions of InDesign? So short of doing two versions of the document then
  exporting one as an EPS to place into the other Im not sure what else to try?!\r\n\r\nany
  help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!\r\ncheers,\r\nChris\r\n\r\n\r\n"
