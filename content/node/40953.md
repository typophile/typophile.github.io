  Drink, so I need to know Monster Energy drink's font for the worg 'energy' as it's
  the same one used in the sample.\r\n\r\nIt is very close to both Eurostile and Bank
  Gothic. The R is similar to Bank Gothic, yet it is more rounded in nature to Eurostile
  Bold Extended... Help. \r\n\r\nI have been using both fonts to recreate, but as
  this is from the web it's not looking so perfect. Can't seem to get the curves just
  so..."

    guess this would be a better one to show. It has all the characters stumping me."

  body: "yes, and through out the site all the headings seem to be bank gothic, it's
    just this one that is different. \r\n\r\nI have been using a combination of eurostile
    bold extended for the s, c and o. Mainly because those letter are rounder than
    those same characters in bank gothic, the end of the s is of course different
    than the bank goth s and those letters look most like eurostile. \r\n\r\nIt's
    just not perfect, the roundness is not just right. Eurostile has a slightly fuller
    curve- but these are slightly tighter, but not as tight at bank gothic. I will
    keep playing with the letters and see how close I can get.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
