		<div class="commentbody">Gregory, <BR> <BR>I would consider not putting any references on your resume. Just put &quot;Ask for references&quot; or don't put anything at all. One of the reasons is that they may want 1, or they may want 3-5. You never know. <BR> <BR>Something else that might be helpful is to list what &quot;Skills&quot; you have. Mine says &quot;Proficient on Mac and PC platforms. Software knowledge includes Photoshop CS and Imageready CS, Illustrator CS, Freehand 10, Dreamweaver MX, InDesign CS, QuarkXPress 4, Pagemaker 6, Flash MX, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MS Office, familiar with 3D Max.&quot; Software knowledge is a big deal with businesses and if you don't list what you know they may toss your resume. <BR> <BR>I would also focus on your name and make it more graphically interesting. You are trying to seperate yourself from the rest, especially in graphic design. Maybe make a logo (made of just type) using your name. Something that people will remember you by. <BR> <BR>I would take off objective and put it on your cover letter. Cover letters are also important. They let you customize your objectives specifically to the company you are applying for. You have to do some research into the company. I have talked with many business owners and some have said they throw Below is a template for a cover letter: <BR>___________________________ <BR>(Insert Date) <BR> <BR>Your addressee</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First off, it&rsquo;s looking a lot better. Your new choices in typefaces are a lot more &ldquo;boring&rdquo;, but they also work together much better, and you don&rsquo;t really want flashy type in your résumé anyway. It looks good now, although I&rsquo;d still think hard about the division of text into two ragged columns, especially columns as widely spaced as the ones you have. I&rsquo;m also not super-fond of the horizontal rules between job names and descriptions; it still feels like too strong a break.</p>
<p>Second, it&rsquo;s time to proofread that bad boy. Typos abound: &ldquo;mulitmedia applicaitons&rdquo;, &ldquo;profficient&rdquo;, and using &ldquo;rolls&rdquo; for &ldquo;roles&rdquo; are ones that popped out at me. Also, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;BBEdit&rdquo; and &ldquo;InDesign CS&rdquo;. InterCaps are annoying, but there are right ways and wrong ways to use them, so better double-check your app names to make sure you have it right.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s looking good!</p>
