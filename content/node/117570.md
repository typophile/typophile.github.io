  body: Linotype Plak Sans is close for letters but not the numerals - as Don pointed
    out the numerals are different.

  body: "Bob, Plak Blak is a good find. Plak Black Condensed is quite close for most
    of the letters in the image [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PlaxBlackCondInUse_4666.jpg]
    Only the _S_ stands out as being too rounded. Perhaps this photo lettering era
    font is a revision of Paul Renner's design for Plak Black Condensed. Most people
    would not notice if it was used as a substitute for the letters, particularly
    if the _S_ is adjusted and the punctuation replaced. \r\nThe numbers appear to
    be from an entirely different font. If they had to be made from scratch, I would
    start with an _8_ to make the _3_.\r\nDon"
