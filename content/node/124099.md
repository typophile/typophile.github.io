  Wikipedia only mentions them once, without giving more information."

  body: "I thought that Kurdish was written with the Arabic script. But then many
    Kurds live in Turkey, and there they may be legally required to use the Latin
    script for their language like the Turks.\r\n\r\nLooking at Omniglot, their illustration
    shows \u1E8D beside its equivalent, Xh, in an alternate Latin script for their
    language, and beside the Arabic and Cyrillic script equivalents. I would take
    that as sufficient evidence that \u1E8D corresponds to an actual element of Kurdish
    phonology and orthography. On the other hand, \u1E27 is <strong>not</strong> shown
    on the [[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kurdish.htm|Omniglot]] page <em>my</em>
    Google search turned up. (Oh, wait, it did appear once - in the chart of how Kurdish
    can be written with the <em>Armenian</em> script.)\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia article
    on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_alphabets|Kurdish Alphabets]] does give
    detail. It turns out that the two letters you mention, plus the apostrophe, were
    part of Jeladet Ali Bedirkhan's original proposal of a Latin alphabet for the
    Kurdish language, but only for rendering words of foreign origin, as the sounds
    they represent are not native to Kurdish. Old orthography Russian had extra letters
    for words borrowed from Greek, and Tibetan and other Indic scripts have extra
    letters for writing Sanskrit, so this isn't that unusual - for that matter, in
    French, the letter W has that status.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, until very recently,
    since the letters Q, W and X aren't part of the Turkish language, Turkish law
    forbade Kurds from using them.\r\n\r\n[[http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/145|This
    article]] is another source for information on Kurdish scripts, but it doesn't
    mention those letters at all."

    a combining diaeresis U+<code>0308</code> that is well positioned might be enough.\r\n\r\nPS
    The French Wiki provides the additional information that those letters are found
    in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALA-LC_romanization\">ALA-LC-romamization</a>
    of Kurdish. Cf http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/kurdish.pdf When searching
    Wikipedia, it is good to check what is said about your search  in various languages."
