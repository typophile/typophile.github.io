  paper.\r\nI am desperately searching for font pairs with a male and a female part

  - Parker/Barrow\r\nZuzana Licko - Mrs. Eaves (as a counterpart to Baskerville)\r\nParaType
  - Didonia (based on Didot)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It can also be argued that roman = male and italic = female. But the definition
    of a proper counter pair is always dependent of the definition of the scope. When
    one leaves out italic, one may also come to this conclusion: https://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/8222620523/in/set-72157632109598583\r\nOr
    when you stick to sans serif, you may find this combination here appropriate:
    https://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/8223240451/ It has to be considered
    though, that in schemes like these, our perception on wether the counter pairs
    have been defined properly, is also dependent on the selection of the counter
    pairs for a specific diagram. "

    & Sensibility</a> represent a polarization of sexual qualities\u2014but it\u2019s

  body: "What's considered \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" qualities in cultural constructs
    (like type, quite obviously, is) has a tendency to change considerably over the
    decades and centuries. Norms, colours, styles, behaviours and ideals have frequently
    been reattributed from one side of the supposed gender divide to the other. Rather
    than positing a historically untenable biological just-so explanation for the
    different gender associations type has, a much more fruitful path would be to
    examine how exactly a certain agglomeration of lines and curves has come to be
    understood as \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" in the discourse about them.\r\n\r\n(And
    what about queer and transsexual type? What would that look like? Much more interesting
    than maintaining patriarchal stereotypes. ;))"

    that\u2019s an interpretation that doesn\u2019t jibe with the facts!\r\n\r\nThe
    \u201Cclean\u201D version, Sense\xAE, which could be interpreted as the no-nonsense
    masculine, was meant for news headlines in feature articles, in which the head
    was part of specially designed page layouts, accompanying pictures, and thus required
    to be understated and play second \uFB01ddle to the other graphic elements.\r\n\r\nThe
    busier version, Sensibility, which could be interpreted as the frilly feminine,
    was meant for basic news heads in default layouts, often without pictures, in
    which the headlines were required to carry more visual interest.\r\n\r\nWhat they
    express, as a pair, is their relative function in the document for which they
    were designed.\r\n\r\nI named them Sense and Sensibility after a search of name
    pairs, looking for two that would appear next to one another in font menus.\r\n\r\nI
    decided to name the reductive version Sense because it has fewer letters, not
    because the typeface looks more masculine, and the busy version Sensibility, because
    it is a busier-looking word, with all those extenders."

    and they also vary in different parts of the world. But if you're designing for
    a modern audience, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what is considered masculine
    and feminine by most folks in that country. Look at magazines sold for men and
    those sold for women and look at the stylistic differences."
