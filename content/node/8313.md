body: I am desiging a new teen magazine that deals a lot with celebrities and fashion.
  Just what we need right? Anyway - I was wondering if anyone might have suggestions
  about fonts? Right now I am in the mock-up stage so anything goes. It has to appeal
  to teenage girls but I am trying to stay away from cutesy. Something on the verge
  of pop culture with feminine undertones? All your suggestions are much appreciated.

    <BR> <BR>Anisette is successfully used in a Teen magazine as you seems to describe
    in Spain... I think anyway what will make the difference is specially the contrast
    of various typefaces used, not specially one alone. <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t find more
    than that use ;&#41; <BR><a href="http://elflady.com/legolasgreenleaf/misc/misc2/images/bravo03nov_001.jpg"

  body: Stephen, check out Font Diner for display fonts. But its the colors more than
    the fonts that squew the magazine towards a teenage girl market. I would research
    other competing teen magazines on the web for color pallets.

  body: Optima is indeed feminine, but it&#39;s way too &#34;mature&#34;, even cold.
    <BR>Pascal would be nice, but there&#39;s no [good] digital version yet. <BR>
    <BR>Costa has always been my favorite Porchez font, and I think it might be very
    good for this. <BR>I hope that doesn&#39;t say anything bad about me... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I did a prototype for a teen magazine a few years ago using a combination
    of FF Sari and FF Cocon, with a handwritten script &#40;whose name escapes me&#41;
    as an accent. Something about the rounded shapes and occasionally non-traditional
    letterforms said &#34;young&#34; to me.  <BR> <BR>But I agree with Daniel -- it&#39;s
    usually color, layout &#40;busy, lots of info-chunks&#41; and use of slangy, casual
    language that brand something as being for teens.

    target=\"_blank\">Costa</a> is sold on the Typofonderie site, if that is what
    you are asking. The specimen is not for re-sell, unless you really want to buy
    one. :^D In which case, email me off-line and we can discuss the price. :^D Otherwise
    you would probably be best served by contacting Jean Fran\xE7ois through <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/contact\"

  body: What&#39;s the name of the publication? What size are you designing for? &#40;dimensions,
    that is&#41;; and do you have a colour scheme worked out at this point? &#40;Obviously
    all these aspects relate to the font choice, right?&#41; <BR> <BR>What a fun project!
