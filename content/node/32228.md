  long time.\r\nI decided to post my first post here because I have this problem and
  I can't find a solution.\r\nI consider myself pretty experienced but I got no clue
  why this happens. Maybe someone of you has seen something similar.\r\n\r\nI have
  Griffith Gothic font (Light, Reg, Bold, Black). Black weight is used which as a
  headline.\r\nWhen printed, certain letters (randomly, but mostly lowercase chars)
  appear thinner [see attached RAR archive file].\r\nPDF file looks ok (it has fonts
  embedded), it prints on postscript printer ok, it rasterizes in Photoshop OK, just
  when RIPped and printed at the printer some letters appear lighter.\r\nInDesign
  file is ok with no weight change, styles look ok.\r\n\r\nWheres the catch?\r\n\r\ndifference.jpg
  file contains rasterized PDF comapred to printed form (upsize at 1600%) as overlaid
  layers in difference mode in photoshop and file vertical_guides.jpg with vertical
  guides for easier comparision. Error is obvious and when seen on paper even more
  obvious. You will find also original PDF that was sent to the printer.\r\n\r\nPrinter
  uses latest version of Harlequin RIP.\r\n\r\nHelp...\r\n\r\n\r\nDrolx\r\np.s. I
  will send the"

  body: My first thought -- which could well be wrong -- is that the lower-case stems
    are in fact a bit thinner than the stems in the caps, so the offset-printed rendering
    is actually correct. Have you looked at the font in FontLab or some similar font
    program?

  body: "It looks as if the Griffith Gothic font you are using in the PDF has overlapping
    paths. This should not appear in a production quality font, so something tells
    me that you are not using the release version?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12-13-03_6226.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    have seen the phenomenon of the thinning characters in some PDF's with specimen
    of my typefaces in development, and as far as I remember it was caused by a wrong
    pathdirection in the affected glyphs. It was visible on screen in Preview in OS
    X, but not on a laserprint."

    body: "Clauses, you are right. Someone along the way added eastern european characters
      into it.\r\n\r\nAs for the stem width for letter \"H\" it is (160) and for letter
      \"i\" it is 150."

    licensed the fonts to you.
