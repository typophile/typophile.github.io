body: "I don\u2019t know wether this has been ventilated before.\r\n\r\nA Word document
  gets placed in InDesign, the text running over many pages. It is science, there
  are many annotations handled as generic footnotes; InDesign does import this correctly
  so that the footnotes take place dynamically at bottom of each page.\r\nBut now
  to the main text, where the annotation numbers are interspersed in the lines. These
  numbers employ the basic figures (0030 \u2026 0039 by encoding) and renders them
  diminished and vertically raised. \u2013 That latter fact is my problem. In a body
  text of 11pt a figure diminished to 5\u20266pt looks famished, looks bad. I would
  like to set the genuin superscript figures of the font instead (00B2, 00B3, 00B9
  and 2074 \u2026 2079 by encoding) because that looks far better. But if I change
  the character in the main text \u2013 the link breaks and the footnote disappears.\r\n\r\n\u2013
  What can be done?"

    by InDesign (I transform them in endnotes in Word, so I have the numbers, but
    not the link).\r\nHowever, have you tried, instead of replacing the figure, to
    apply the Character > Unicode > Superior directly to the reference?"

    numbers, which InDesign can do automatically.  In English (sorry), Type > Document

    there is much griping about the inadequacies of InDesign's automated footnotes,
    and many people use various workarounds, several of which are described by <a
