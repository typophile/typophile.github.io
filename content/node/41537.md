    to a certain one. Otherwise times are better than ever for buying typefaces online.
    More and more smaller foundries have online services and some of the bigger ones
    covers a lot of the professional typefaces around...\r\n\r\nHopefully fast enough
    for you?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com\r\nhttp://www.veer.com\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com\r\n\r\netc
    etc\r\n\r\n"

    that a credit card can give you.\r\n\r\nIn the US, it depends on when you notify
    your bank of the problem. If you do it within two days, your liability is $50,
    just like a credit card, but if later than two days, your liability could be as
    much as $500. After 60 days, your liability is unlimited. The real problem is
    that a thief could drain your entire bank account and you'd be out that money
    during the time it took the bank to investigate and decide to restore your funds.
