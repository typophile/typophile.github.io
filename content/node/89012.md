  reader for a while.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find a standard text outlining the principles
  of legibility for Chinese typesetting, perhaps in the same way that Jan Tschichold's
  The New Typography speaks to the principles of legibility for Latin alphabets .\r\n\r\nMaybe
  no such text exists, but thought I would put it out there.\r\n\r\nRegards"
