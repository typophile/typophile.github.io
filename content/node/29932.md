body: For some reason, I cant seem to save the metrics information onto a ttf file.
  PFB work fine, no problem but I need it in TTF. I adjusted the kerning for hours
  on end and now it seems it doesn't save that information! Please help someone.

    your fonts on? \r\n2. What application do you use to build your fonts? \r\n3.
    What operating system do you use to test the fonts? \r\n4. What applications do
    you use to test your fonts? \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nA."
