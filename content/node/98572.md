  body: The image is so small and the letters are so common, that it could be anything.
    You can try Arial Black or Helvetica Black, a bit expanded.

    body: That's terrible advice. It's high end fashion. They're not going to use
      Arial or Helvetica. It's anything Gotham is a closer bet. Something with more
      rounded geometric, uniline letter forms. In any case it's Chanel so it's custom.
      Existing typefaces will only give you an approximation.

  body: "Chanel has always used exclusive bespoke typefaces and even for its main
    woodmark (makes sense for a fashion industry leading company). For instance, on
    [[http://www.chanel.com|chanel.com]], they're using one as webfont which is called
    \"abchanel-couture\" and looks not so far from your sample. Whatever it is called,
    it's some sort of all-caps extended grotesk.\r\nSome substitutes: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/presicav/|Presicav]],

  body: The type is called ABChanel Couture, it has been drawing by Steidl for the
    first book they made for Karl Lagerfeld. One of my favorite font.

    for Lagerfeld was drawn \u2018at\u2019 Steidl, not \u2018by\u2019 Steidl. Akzidenz
    Grotesk Extended would definitely make a better substitute than Helvetica or Arial.\r\n\r\nhttp://instagram.com/p/aAuAYVrmU5/"
