  body: "Definitely lettering. Kevin's suggested substitutes should work fine.\r\nAs
    for Jean Luc Godard's movies themselves, they also used lettering rather than
    fonts as such.\r\nKai Bernau from Atelier Carvalho Bernau created a JeanLuc Typeface
    in hommage to Jean Luc Godard based on the lettering in some of his movies: http://www.carvalho-bernau.com/jlg/\r\nThe
    web page includes an interesting discussion of the lettering used in the movies.
    It might also give you some insight into the lettering used in this poster for
    Godard's sixth movie, Le m\xE9pris of 1963, released in English as contempt http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_%28film%29\r\nDon"
