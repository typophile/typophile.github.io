  first question is, is there a typographic term for this kind of slightly smaller
  caps (or larger small caps, if you will)?\r\n\r\nI've seen it in some books before,
  mostly for proper names. Presumably it's used because the font doesn't have a set
  of small caps, and scaling regular caps down 5% or 10% obviously doesn't look so
  bad as scaling them down to x-height.\r\n\r\nSo my second questions is, are there
  fonts with a set of those slightly smaller caps -- maybe in addition to a set of
  regular small caps?"

    Atma is a typeface that comes to mind \u2013 it has 3 sizes of smaller caps, including
    mid caps."

  body: "Thanks! Apparently, those caps in the Baker Street sign above is called three-quarter
    caps -- or quarter caps (QC) in short. Between them and small caps (SC), there
    is mid caps (MC). Also, there is petite caps (PC) which are even smaller than
    SC. I assume these are all the commonly known sizes of small caps?\r\n\r\nAtma
    has SC, MC and QC, but does any font have all four?"

    doubt it. When would one need five sets of caps (incl. the regular full-size caps)?\r\n<a

  body: "Wow, sorry, I thought the \"Quarter Caps\" were the smaller ones. Misleading
    indeed.\r\n\r\nI personally think 2 sets of smallcaps is very nice to have, 3
    gets harder to manage, and 4 is really overkill for all but the most exotic applications.
    BTW it's also worth considering that small caps and petite caps have their own
    OT features, while more additional cap sizes need to be put into stylistic sets."
