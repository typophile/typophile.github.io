  body: Radical. Most likely not a font, and if so, I haven't seen it available digitally.
    Have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=DF.113527.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SURF&sampleSize=144">Mercano
    Empire</a> and <a href="http://www.identikalshop.com/font_ind.php?baseProductID=8">BQE</a>
    which may have been influenced by the same typeface.

    body: "Thanks Stephen. I can definitely see the influence it has made on BQE!
      It's very similar. This typeface was used quite commonly in surfing magazines
      around early 70's. While we are on this subject I have another a few others
      from similar time that I would love to know they are: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wave1_3857.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SMOKN_3667.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/sundown_4391.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/afrls_6335.jpg]"
