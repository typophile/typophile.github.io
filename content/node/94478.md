body: "<strong>New typographic aspects of Adobe InDesign/Illustrator CS6: you can
  switch to the Middle East version free of charge, and you can easily add spelling
  and hyphenation dictionaries for many languages.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you have a license
  for Adobe InDesign CS6 or Illustrator CS6 in a Western European language or in U.S.
  English, either as a standalone product, as part of an \u201Coffline\u201D Creative
  Suite or as part of Creative Cloud, you can switch these apps to the Middle East
  versions free of charge. You can use the Middle East versions in English, but you\u2019ll
  get access to additional spelling/hyphenation languages as well as to extra UI elements
  for right-to-left languages such as Arabic or Hebrew. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how you
  get the Middle East versions of some applications:\r\n\r\n1. Install your normal
  CS6. \r\n2. Go to https://creative.adobe.com/ \r\n3. Sign in with your Adobe ID.
  \r\n4. Click on \u201CApps\u201D, download the Adobe installer. \r\n5. Launch the
  Adobe Applications Manager if it did not start automatically. You should see a list
  of applications from the Creative Cloud, and on some it should say \u201CInstalled\u201D.
  Probably with InDesign and Illustrator you\u2019ll get that. \r\n6. Click on your
  login name on the left, choose Preferences. \r\n7. In \u201CLanguage\u201D, select
  \u201CEnglish Arabic\u201D (actually, \u201CEnglish\u201D followed by Arabic writing).
  \r\n8. As the Install Location, pick /Applications if you\u2019re on a Mac. \r\n9.
  Click on Save. Now the list of the applications\u2019 \u201CInstalled\u201D statuses
  should change. \r\n10. Pick InDesign and click on \u201CInstall\u201D. The Adobe
  Applications Manager should now download the \u201CLS6\u201D (Middle East) version
  of InDesign instead of the \u201CLS16\u201D (U.S. English) version, and it\u2019ll
  install on top of your previous InDesign CS6.\r\n\r\nI did just try that and now
  I have a Middle Eastern version, registered and activated just like the previous
  one. All my plugins etc. work as before. I\u2019ve also done the same with Illustrator
  CS6 ME and it also works. The only caveat of course is that the InDesign ME download
  is 1.22 GB and Illustrator is 1.88 GB. So it\u2019s a long download... \r\n\r\nBefore
  you do all this, you can rename the folder in which you have your U.S. English version
  of InDesign/Illustrator from /Applications/Adobe InDesign CS6 into something like
  /Applications/Adobe InDesign CS6 US -- to keep the non-ME version of InDesign/Illustrator
  just in case. \r\n\r\nAlso, InDesign CS6 now uses Hunspell as the default engine
  for spelling and hyphenation (but the previous engines such as Proximity or Winsoft
  are still available). Hunspell is based on open-source dictionaries and hyphenation
  patterns which are used in products such as OpenOffice or Firefox. InDesign ships
  with a large number of dictionaries for various languages, but it\u2019s now possible
  to easily add dictionaries for languages that aren\u2019t included (e.g. Armenian
  or Georgian). The Adobe document <a href=\"http://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/kb/add_cs_dictionaries.html\">\u201CAddition/Removal
  of Hunspell dictionaries in CS6\u201D</a> explains how to add extra dictionaries
  and hyphenation patterns yourself. \r\n\r\nPs. <strong>See my comment below</strong>
  for an easy way to enable more hyphenation and spelling languages in CS6 apps!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nAdam\r\n"

    a contact at Adobe: it seems to be the only way to get the ME version if one is
    outside the Middle East or North Africa. [There was a brief moment last night
    when I thought I might simply be able to purchase an ME version license from the
    Adobe store, but when I got to the payment stage, although my street address was
    correctly inserted from my Adobe profile, the drop down list of country names
    was limited to ME/NA countries.]'

  body: "Sans sleep, \r\n\r\nthe big thing about CS6 is that by default, Adobe is
    using an open-source spelling and hyphenation engine (Hunspell), and that Adobe
    has worked on many of the included open-source spelling dictionaries and hyphenation
    patterns themselves (so while the engine is open-source, the same as used in OpenOffice,
    Mozilla products, hyphenator.js etc.) and while the hyphenation patterns are principally
    based on TeX hyphenation patterns, the actual dictionaries and patterns included
    in CS6 are largely upgraded by Adobe. But because of the fact that Hunspell is
    the default engine, one can easily use additional existing dictionaries and patterns,
    and it is relatively easy to create your own (or at least, the process of creating
    them is well-documented). \r\n\r\nIn previous versions of CS applications, the
    spelling and hyphenation engines were licensed from 3rd-party vendors such as
    Proximity and Winsoft, and were closed-source. In order to add your own, you needed
    to also write a full plugin. So while it has been possible, it was more difficult.
    \r\n\r\nFor CS5, Mindsteam Software has created <a href=\"http://www.mindsteam.com/products.html\">MindHyph
    and MindSpell</a> which are plugins that enable spelling and hyphenation using
    the Hunspell format. This means that with MindHyph and MindSpell, you can install
    the same Hunspell spelling dictionaries and hyphenation patterns in InDesign CS5
    which by default are included in CS6. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    me the advise below:\r\n\r\nAdobe InDesign CS6 is InDesign version 8.0. To enable
    the Middle East version,\r\n1. Be sure InDesign is not running\r\n2. Click on
    the Start button, then on Run\r\n3. In the Run dialog, in the Open field, type

  body: "There is a 2009 thread on the <a href=\"http://www.indiscripts.com/post/2009/10/switching-indesigns-ui-language-in-windows\">Indiscripts</a>
    site which has some more information about switching the \"feature set\" (which
    is the name referred to the Western vs. CJK vs. Middle East abilities of InDesign)
    on Windows. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that it's potentially possible to switch
    the \"Feature Set Locale Setting\" on Windows (the values seem to be: 256 for
    Western feature set, 257 for CJK feature set and 259 for Middle East feature set),
    but the application still needs to have the actual plugins that are required for
    a given feature set. \r\n\r\nI just tested this with a trial version of InDesign
    CS6 Middle East for Windows: it installs the Middle East (259) feature set by
    default, and the user can change it to Western (256) but *not* to CJK (257) --
    then, InDesign complains that \"CJK Layout\" is missing. \r\n\r\nFrom reading
    the comments in the thread, it looks that it's only possible on Windows while
    on Mac OS X, each version of the application has just one feature set. This is
    confirmed (by analogy) in the <a href=\"http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/indesign/sdk/cs6/server/intro-to-indesign-server.pdf\">InDesign
    CS6 Server documentation</a>, which states: \"InDesign Server performs composition
    based on the enabled feature set: Roman (English) or Japanese (CJK). On Windows,
    registry settings are used to specify the enabled feature set. On Mac OS, there
    are two applications, one with the Roman feature set enabled and one with the
    CJK feature set enabled.\" \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
