  on the aesthetic of nixie vacuum tubes. Nixie tubes you ask? They are the predecessor
  to LED displays, they were used extensively by NASA during the space race of the
  40's, and 50's. The typeface is a matrix style face and the design was in part a
  study in creating something that allows others to use it and at the same time 'redesign'
  it.\r\n\r\nI would really like to hear what other typographers think Nixie.\r\n\r\nYou
  can find more examples and download the mac or PC fonts from my website: http://www.meld.com/ken\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen"

    could be ideal. Take you lower case c. Is that really the friendliest way to display
    it?  Still, I am sympathtic towards the project. It's NEAT-O.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comments. Yeah, it's eccentric (bordering on geeky). For me
    the wonder of typography has always been that a designer might create a typeface
    but the use of that typeface is well beyond his/her control or vision.\r\nIn part
    I wanted to take the actual form of the typeface a step farther. The lowercase
    c I create was a decision based on my vision of the letterforms, but the matrix
    allows you create a lowercase c in your vision and it might be more effective
    than mine. The design has then grown beyond my vision and into something I did
    not imagine, I find this the most compelling idea behind Nixie.\r\n\r\nken"

  body: Well, it's odd. You've used a LED/LCD system to try to portray a Nixie-tube
    aesthetic, and the result looks like neither. It seems like the large number of
    segments hasn't brought a proportionate gain in legibility or flexibility.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, I'll try to elaborate a bit more.\r\n\r\n<em>The
    design has then grown beyond my vision and into something I did not imagine, I
    find this the most compelling idea behind Nixie.</em>\r\n\r\nThis idea came about
    after talking with a few friends that are typographers. One of them had the good
    fortune designing a typeface that quickly because world famous (in the design
    industry).  One of the results of that was he saw his typeface used on everything
    from Hollywood movie posters to the Bible, to German gay porn magazine covers.
    Initially his (and all of our) reaction was \"it should only be use for what it
    was designed for\". But then after thinking about it, I really came to like the
    idea of others 'misusing' something I made.\r\n\r\nFor 100 years graphic/prodcut
    design has been built on the idea of a benevolent visionary. A person with a vision
    of the (better) future and they will dispense this through form and color to their
    audience. From Alexy Brodovitch and Max Braun to Paul Rand and Morphosis their
    wondrous visions (and they are great, I not knocking these people!) were created
    and sent down to the common man.\r\n\r\nTypography struck me as different. You
    design a typeface that fulfills a basic set of requirements; readable, and special
    feel, some vernacular etc. But then you put it out into the world. From that point
    on you have no control over it, or what people do with it. And there are many
    tools out there to do something with type. So even if you intended to  make a
    highly readable typeface some designer out there will grunge it up and put in
    on a poster you can't read. If you make a typeface inspired by the soul groups
    from the 50's, someone will use it for the cover of an annual report. All these
    uses are well beyond the vision of the original author. I find that one of the
    strong points of typography, a typeface always becomes more than what it started
    out as.\r\n\r\nI want to explore going even farther with this idea, not just put
    a design object out for <em>use</em> but design something that redesign is inherent
    in. Something that is easy to change into your own.\r\n\r\nOf course you can go
    into illustrator and change Frutiger outlines. But it's not inherent in the the
    design, it's not part of Frutigers vision of what the typeface what supposed to
    do.\r\n\r\nken\r\n\r\n"
