body: It seems like as I am honing my "typeface eye", I am seeing FF Meta everywhere.
  I don't know if it is overused, but I really love it. Anybody suggest a strong serif
  typeface to match it? I think Bank of america uses Meta with a serif, but I haven't
  pinpointed it. I am sitting in Panera Bread right now and I see it again. (I think,
  but it is in small caps, hard to be sure).

    take up the same overall width. Is there a word to call that \"feature\" and can
    anyone name some other good text faces that do the same thing? \r\n\r\n\r\nTimothy\r\nFound

    it too. It's rare though. Plus it stops working when you get too light or too
    bold.\r\n\r\nThe obvious serif counterpart to Meta is Officina. But I'm sure people
    can suggest something better. And yes, Meta is majorly over-used.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yea, I thought Officina, but then I should use Officina Sans, er I digress.\r\nI
    have some Meta fonts, and I am looking at Unit. Seriously though I am addicted
    to these stylish sans-serif fonts and signage. My last year I have purchased:\r\nWhitney\r\nProxima
    Sans Condensed\r\nClearViewOne\r\nYearning to find the cash for:\r\nFF Unit\r\nFF
    Din\r\nInterstate (also overused, but still very friendly and familiar)\r\n\r\nWhy
    am I addicted to all these fonts that my wife can't distinguish from? I dunno.\r\n\r\nI
    love the flares on the lowercase \"L\", though I hate it in Trebuchet."
