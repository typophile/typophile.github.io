  where I want the pages to have the feel of a book from the 1880s and 1890s. I am
  looking for a good typeface to use for the body copy that has a slight irregular,
  letterpress feel to it.\r\n\r\nSo far I have found: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/baselinefonts/old-times-american/old-times-american/|Old
  Times American]]\r\nbut this seems more in keeping with a newspaper or periodical
  than a book.\r\n\r\nAnd: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/archetype/|Archetype]]\r\nwhich
  I like a lot but I am not sure whether it is from the right era\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any thoughts or suggestions?"

  body: Archetype has similarities to the Janson type by Nicholas Kis, which he made
    around 1690.

  body: "Wow. Scotch Modern is <em>perfect</em> in terms of letter shapes. A great
    recommendation. \r\n\r\nI think for my needs it may be a little too perfect in
    execution as it lacks the slightly irregular quality I am seeking. Although my
    printed page will obviously not have the texture of a letterpress-printed page
    I want it to suggest at first glance that it may have been printed on a Victorian
    press, with the slightly irregular baseline and all that entails."
