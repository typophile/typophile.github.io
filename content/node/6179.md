    the others who&#39;re answering these questions&#41; actually have a good visual
    memory and you have seen a lot of fonts in your life and you remember it? Or is
    it more of a algoritm: serif/sans/decorative/ - grotesque/geometric/humanist -
    and so on? I guess is a combination of both, right?'

  body: For this one, I started by searching MyFonts for the keywords &#34;futuristic&#34;
    and &#34;scifi,&#34; since that&#39;s how a font like this would be classified.
    I even checked the free-font archive, DaFont, to no avail. Finally, I did a little
    tweaking on the file so that I got the letters black on a white background, and
    put it through MyFonts&#39; <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/">WhatTheFont</a>,
    which yielded the answer. Once I saw what the font was, I understood why I couldn&#39;t
    find it with the proper keywords -- FF fonts typically don&#39;t have any, probably
    because they&#39;re relatively new to MyFonts, and there are a ton of them. Probably
    also because they&#39;re spending too much time on things like <a href="http://typographi.com/000894.php">Olympukes</a>,
    but we won&#39;t go into that here.

  body: I can&#39;t speak for anybody else - after 20 years in this biz I just know
    a lot of fonts. If I don&#39;t recognize a font at all I don&#39;t even try -
    leave it to the experts. No algorhythms. But if I recognize and can&#39;t immediately
    ID a font I&#39;ll turn to my font collection or a book, or perhaps a site where
    I might have seen it. It&#39;s like trying to remember the name of a band or a
    movie title - it bugs me if I can&#39;t figure it out. <BR> <BR>This site is one
    way I take a break from work, when I&#39;m too lazy to actually get up from my

  body: I guess the more general answer to your question is that I know a good number
    of fonts on sight, but for the thousands of others I rely on my sleuthing techniques.
    I love looking things up. Basically I have a number of places to try, but I typically
    start with MyFonts or DaFont &#40;if it looks like it&#39;s going to turn out
    to be a free font&#41;. I used to always start with WhatTheFont, but haven&#39;t
    lately, for some reason. Then I move on to one of the likely other foundries whose
    catalogs aren&#39;t on MyFonts. If I can&#39;t get it in any of those ways, I
    usually let it go after that.

  body: 'This may become the &#39;thread that wouldn&#39;t die&#39;, but I&#39;d like
    to make a stab at answering your latest question about the quality of a free font
    design. <BR> <BR>The first thing is the hardest. Know whether it is original or
    copied and re-named. If it&#39;s a rip-off you should shun it like the plague.
    <BR> <BR>Then I would say you should see if it has design consitency. Are the
    letters the same height that should be? Are the strokes of the letters properly
    executed. Are the letterforms related in their shapes and the way stems intersect?
    Are the serifs appropriate-looking? Is the x-height consistent? <BR> <BR>The last
    part is subjective and can over-ride the previous considerations at times: Do
    you like the way it looks when you use it in words? Are the letters spaced the
    way they should be? &#40;Poorly designed fonts often don&#39;t have much letter-fitting
    or kerning done.&#41; Is the lettering reflecting a strong style in a way that
    seems original, or is it just like 50 other fonts that use a similar gimmick,
    like square counters for a &#39;tech look&#39; &#40;blecchhh!&#41;. <BR> <BR>Those
    are some of the thoughts that go through my mind looking at a free font for the
    first time and trying to decide whether it&#39;s worth downloading, even at that
    price. To me if it&#39;s garbage, and I won&#39;t use it, what difference does
    it make if it&#39;s free?'

  body: Free fonts also often contain limited character sets, which can be a drawback.
    <BR> <BR>But it depends so much on what you&#39;re planning to use it for, i.e.
    text or display - most free fonts seem to be display. I think it&#39;s exceedingly
    rare to find a fully developed text font for free, with all the bells and whistles.
    It&#39;s different if you just need a few words. <BR> <BR>Also consider how the
    font looks at various sizes. If it&#39;s well proportioned it should hold up at
    both small and large sizes. But again, depends on your usage.

    the font that VH1 &#40;Europe&#41; is using now looks. It&#39;s a sans serif light

    - Is there a famous &#40;like in &#39;of reference&#39;&#41; example&#40;s&#41;

    mention Graham Meade, who states himself that his fonts aren&#39;t the very highest
    quality, but he clearly puts lots of time into them &#40;and there are plenty
    of fonts one can find on MyFonts for sale that ail big time in the quality department&#41;.
    Check out Meade&#39;s huge  <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/n_s.htm"
    target="_blank"> Street family</a> for an example. Most of the fonts in the family
    have 88 kerning pairs. These are pairs of characters coded within the font for
    custom spacing relative to each other. It&#39;s a time-consuming process and one
    way to check on quality. 88 is on the low end, but most free fonts have none.
    Character sets are full in the Street family. <BR> <BR>Also see the incredible
    output of <a href="http://www.rogersfonts.org.uk/index.html" target="_blank">
    Roger White</a>. Kerning pairs vary from about 300 to 900-plus. Character sets
    are complete. The Sudbury family would be a good one to check out. <BR> <BR>Another
    incredible free offering is Igino Marini&#39;s <a href="http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html"

    target="_blank"> Storm&#39;s Lido</a>. <BR> <BR>Note that some &#40;all?&#41;
    of these font families are free for noncommercial use only. <BR><br>

  body: This has been an interesting thread. I appreciated Tiffany&#39;s referral
    to Gaultney&#39;s Gentium. It looks like a very nice typeface, and I have just
    downloaded it. <BR> <BR>However, in reference to Mike F&#39;s  recommendation
    of Roger White&#39;s fonts, I have to say that browsing the collection showed
    a lot of heavily &#39;inspired&#39; fonts. Sudbury, for example looks remarkably
    similar to Les Usherwood&#39;s fonts, especially &#39;Lynton&#39;. Yes I see some
    differences, but the character of the font is not original, in my judgement. Many
    other fonts on his site also seem like re-named re-interpretations &#40;to give
    the benefit of the doubt&#41; of other exisiting fonts. <BR> <BR>For me to be
    impressed by free fonts, I would like to know that they are really original work.

  body: So it is.  <BR> <BR>I notice you apparently edited out your following question
    about the ethicality of digitizing typefaces.  Even though the question is gone,
    I have thought about this a lot, and since I raised the issue with my criticism,
    I would like to state my own personal position on it. <BR> <BR>I think a digitization
    is ethical if the typeface design is no longer the property of the designer or
    the foundry that issed it &#40;in other words, a revival of an old typeface&#41;.
    If an authorized digitization exists of a newer typeface, such as those of Usherwood&#39;s
    Caxton, then digitization under a new name is unethical, in my view. <BR> <BR>So
    what about the common practice of imitation of a successful design with an &#39;interpretation&#39;
    or &#39;adaptation&#39;, or whatever other euphemism you choose? You can say it
    happens all the time, even among well-known foundries, and has throughout the
    history of type.  I still would call those instances unethical, but because of
    the ridiculous copyright/patent issues regarding typefaces, they would not apparently
    be illegal. <BR> <BR>If two designers revive the same typeface under different
    names, I guess it&#39;s up to the user&#39;s decide which is better and how much
    to pay for them. Neither should be worth as much as an original work, in my opinion.
    Alternate characters, kerning, and the fidelity and quality of the letterform
    renderings would all be factors in deciding which I would consider to be the best.
    <BR> <BR>Making a few alterations to someone else&#39;s design and calling it
    yours is also unethical. That seems obvious. <BR> <BR>Combining elements of various
    other typefaces to create a &#39;new&#39; typeface is a bit &#39;gray&#39;, but
    seems basically  dishonest if it is represented as something new and not a hybrid
    of other designs. Nick Curtis tells you when he does this, and that I can respect.
    <BR> <BR>Does that cover all the bases?

  body: On a slight tangent - nobody&#39;s addressing the BEST way to get a font for
    free, which is to get your client to pay for it. In the not-too-distant past,
    people paid an arm and a leg for typesetting &#40;got their money&#39;s worth
    in terms of quality&#41;. Now the client assumes typesetting is part of the designer&#39;s
    job, and included in the fee. If you think a particular font is really integral
    to your design, it doesn&#39;t hurt to ask the client to at least split the cost
    with you. I&#39;ve gotten some of my favorite fonts that way.

    your reply. I know perhaps we have gotten a tad off the &#39;Type Identification
    Board&#39; topic, but those issues are ones we all have to deal with and make
    our own judgments about.  <BR> <BR>The information about Roger White&#39;s fonts
    is interesting, but it does seem to leave some questions about the originals he
    was working from. As you say Caxton isn&#39;t as old as he stated, unless Usherwood
    arrived at Caxton in the same way Roger White did, by digitizing something older.
    In the &#39;Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces&#39;  it says: &#34;Design prepared
    originally for Typesettra Ltd in Toronto, a design studio owned by the late Leslie
    Usherwood &#40;1932 - 1982&#41;. Rights in the typeface were assigned to Letraset
    in 1981.&#34; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how the typeface exists in England in
    metal form before that period, but maybe there is an explanation. I am also more
    intrigued to review the other White fonts and see how they match up with other
    typefaces historically. I know there was a Baskerville, and this can be a valid
    revival, but I prefer revivals to use the original name, so that we know what
    they are based on. <BR> <BR>Anyway, once more, I echo Yves words <i>&#34;don&#39;t

    I have huge doubts that all of his fonts are what he described to you Mike. Maybe
    some of them are what he said, but I doubt that most of them are.  <BR> <BR>He
    even has the ever popular freeware script &#39;Black Chancery&#39; &#40;Newborough&#41;
    in there! Not to mention ITC Weidemann &#40;Curborough&#41;, Handel Gothic &#40;Newtown

    Yoxall&#41;, ITC Benguiat Gothic &#40;Gratwich&#41;, Palatino &#40;Queens Park&#41;
    and Vivaldi &#40;Hanford Script&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Maybe these are new digitizations,
    as he describes, but they can&#39;t all be from 40 year old books, and they can&#39;t
    all be things whose names he doesn&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t want to spend
    more time identifying others, but I am convinced very little of this collection
    has not been digitized before. Some of his italics were just obliqued Romans.
    I can&#39;t say I am impressed by what he has there, for the most part. <BR> <BR>That
