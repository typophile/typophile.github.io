  body: I've asked the Managing Director of Essen about the story behind the font
    (not the part of them going against the designer) but he's out of office until
    the 10th. I'll try one of the designers instead and get back when, or if I get
    an answer...

    is what she says about the font:\r\n\r\n<cite>The name of the font is Swedbank
    Sans and it's developed by Essen in corporation with Monotype England under the
    supervision of Robin Nicholas (who also made Arial). The font is custom made for
    Swedbank (exclusive rights) and are available in four weights; Regular, Medium,
    Bold and Extra Bold.</cite>"

  body: "First off, a kind thanks to Marten for inquiring into the origins of the
    font whose very existence was unknown to me until last night. \r\n\r\nFor the
    record, I was never contacted by Essen or Monotype England regarding Klavika in
    any capacity - for licensing, changes, alterations etc. Like most type designers
    I've made several changes to my typefaces for clients. It's something I actually
    enjoy quite a bit especially if it's for specific conditions so the font will
    perform better. So no, I never refused to change Klavika. As I said, I was never
    contacted in the first place. (to be fair, Stefan mentions this was a 'nasty rumor')\r\n\r\nI
    was however contacted by a distributor in Sweden in the summer of '06 inquiring
    into the possibility of a unlimited global license of Klavika for a financial
    client. To make a long story short, they didn't like our price and we never heard
    from them again. Swedbank to date has license for 8 CPUs of Klavika.\r\n\r\nSo
    here we are.\r\n\r\nI can only speculate beyond this, so if I learn more, I'll
    chime in.\r\n\r\nthanks again"

  body: "Eric, they definately used the original (and modified) Klavika in different
    applications that excides the 8 user license.\r\n\r\nFor example... all my bank
    statements use the typeface, and I can't think they use the same computer to send
    out all bank statements.\r\n\r\n"

    as long as we can't perform a point by point comparison of both Klavika and Swedbank

    reused to produce the latter. Untill then anything written in this thread is speculation

    by now, Monotype also did <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=71">a
    Metro "inspired" design for their Opel corporate face</a>. I haven't checked yet
    if parts of the design coincidentally match point by point. O:^)

  body: That would really make sense, Eric! But we are still looking at something
    that's resembles your design. And if Swedbank/Essen used Klavika in connection
    with the lounch of their new identity it's not that far-fetched they deliberately
    made their own version a copy. That's quite nasty, if you ask me...

    is actually the second time they've pulled this stunt. Previously it was with
    my font Bryant.

    for half a year, or more, without paying proper license. They can afford it, and
    they still should.

    Sans was based on Klavika:\r\n\r\n<cite>The answer to your question is no. We
    didn't use Klavika as a starting point. But we wanted Swedbank Sans to be a modern
    sans serif that like for example Klavika and other modern sans as Stainless and
    Morgan Sans would breathe 21th century and modernity. So of course there are similarities.</cite>"
