    Letters</a> was about and for India, and it has some Indian-themed typefaces that
    come with it. Plus, the money goes to good causes in that country.'

  body: It&#39;s for food packaging in Europe &#40;flavour descriptor&#41;, so it&#39;s
    both for visual appeal and Native tongue. But primaraily the customers aren&#39;t
    going to be able to read it, but just in case they are Indian I want to make it
    say something sensible. Put it this way, you see people walking around with &#39;chinese&#39;
    tatoos that mean nothing in reality, I don&#39;t want the embarrasment of this
    to happen especially on a mass produced product. I think i&#39;ll go with Hindu
    as it&#39;s the majority language in India and many indian peoples second language
    too.  Space is tight so this is a fair comprimise I feel.

  body: For an overview of the number of languages spoken in India, see the <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=India">Ethnologue
    country report</a>. Note that linguists regularly disagree over what constitutes
    a language versus a dialect, so it is impossible to get an accurate count of languages
    per se. The most widely spoken language in India is Hindi, but in some provinces
    the majority language is likely to be something else. For instance, the Marathi
    language in Maharashtra, or Bengali in Bengal &#40;and neighbouring Bangladesh&#41;.
    To my knowledge there are thirteen scripts used in India, including Latin and
    Arabic. Hindi and Marathi are written in the Devanagari script. Often, outside
    India, you will see packaging or local signage that reflects language and script
    of the dominant immigrant community or communities, and this may not be Hindi.
    In the east end of London, for example, you will see a lot of Bengali; in other
    places &#40;including here in Vancouer&#41; you will see a lot of Punjabi written
    in the Gurmukhi script.
