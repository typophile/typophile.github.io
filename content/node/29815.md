  The original name could be differnet. Please see the attached image. It's Monotype
  Baskerville with serifs chopped off here and there. None of the big foundries seems
  to have it. Does anybody know it?\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A design agency in UK send it to us asking about the distributor, because
    they themselves don't know where it came from. A typical case of somebody either
    hacking (torturing) Baskerville or copying it onto the agency's servers. \r\nUnfortunately
    I don't have more information, that's why I hoped that somebody would recognise
    it.\r\n\r\nI also doubt that it was a custom job for Lexus (car), but who know's..."
