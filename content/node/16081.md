  Detterer, 1888-1947\r\n\r\nErnst Detterer was a calligrapher and type designer who
  worked in Chicago. In 1921 he founded the Printing Arts Dept. at the School of the
  Art Institute in Chicago which included printing, typesetting and design as part
  of the curriculum. This was the first school in the Chicago area to offer an alternative
  to apprenticeship practice in printing training. Among his first students was [[Robert
  Hunter Middleton]] with whom Detterer designed the Eusebius typefaces based on the
  1470 Roman type of [[Nicolas Jenson]] for [[Ludlow Typograph]]. He later became
  the Custodian of the Wing Collection of Printing and Typography at the Newberry
  Library in Chicago. When the Society of Typographic Arts formed in 1927 Detterer
  was the first secretary of the organization.\r\n\r\nHe was considered a follower
  of Edward Johnston and researched early inscriptional and manuscript lettering.
  \r\n\r\nHe was born in 1888 in Lake Mills, Wisconsin, and died in 1947 at age 59
  in Evanston, Illinois.\r\n"
