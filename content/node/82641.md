  body: "I like the way you made the <strong>r</strong> and the <strong>a</strong>
    relate to each other, but I think it's too subtle. How would it look if you brought
    the top stroke of the <strong>a</strong> closer to the <strong>r</strong>?\r\nThe
    gap at the bottom of the <strong>a</strong> looks too big. I suggest you close
    it up a little. How would it look if you added a similar gap to the  <strong>e</strong>?\r\nThere's
    something about all these curves that makes the <strong>v</strong> look a little
    stiff and out of place. What if you curved the left side of the <strong>v</strong>
    to follow the curve of the <strong>a</strong>? (That last one is kind of a long
    shot, and it might look awful, but you never know.)"

  body: "Thanks for the quick reply PublishingMojo!\r\n\r\nIn the last revision of
    the logotype (the one I posted) I made the gap between the /r/ and the /a/ even
    a bit wider, because otherwise the /r/ and /a/ stick together too much in comparison
    to the others.\r\n\r\nWhen the gap in the /a/ is closed up more, it gets too bulky
    in the middle. And then the horizontal distribution of the spaces at the bottom
    is gone.\r\n\r\nI had a gap in the /e/ in previous versions, but that doesn't
    really do it either.\r\n\r\nMight try to add a slight curve to the /v/ but I'm
    afraid that the /e/ will get more lonely."
