  body: The PAC-MAN font appears to be a modification of a typeface <BR>that appears
    in the Solotype catalog as Guggenheim Shaded. <BR>I don&#39;t find it digitized
    anywhere by that name. Check <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nq=1&amp;q=pacman"
    target="_blank"> here</a> for <BR>two suitable fonts.
