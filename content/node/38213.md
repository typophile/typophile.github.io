    grids, as well as for their books on the subject. Wim Crouwell is known for doing
    awesome stuff with grids, including grid based lettering, and there are some great
    interviews with him on YouTube, as well as in Helvetica: The Film."

  body: "Koppa's reply is the best answer (and a wonderfully bizarre photo of Tschichold).
    I would add Jost Hochuli. \r\n\r\n\"Layout\" is such a broad term \u2013 do you
    mean books? magazines? web pages? Even if you're talking about books, there's
    huge variety, from a well-made novel (the sort of page that makes you want to
    read the text, and gets out of your way while you do so) to an art book or a complex
    integration of visuals and text. \r\n\r\nOne of the finest practitioners of page
    design working today is Jack Stauffacher. His sense of the relationships between
    elements, and how they'll be perceived by the reader, is very highly developed.
    The results are subtle, not obvious. \r\n\r\nJohn Berry\r\n"
