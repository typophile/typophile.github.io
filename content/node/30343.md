  body: I think this has enough style in the finish that you don't need to get so
    wacky with the 'k', 'o',  and 'x'. More standard forms there would make this a
    more flexible, usable face.

    body: "HI there Stephen\r\nFirst i would like to thank your opinion, and u're
      right we changed the \"k\" and \"x\" to not give such distant forms from the
      rest of the caracthers, altought we have remain the form of the \"o\", by now.\r\n\r\nI
      also would like to show u the first sketches of the UpperCases and Numbers,
      to some appreciation.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nLuis[img:sites/default/files/old-images/purpura

    I know \"p\xFArpura\" means purple in Spanish; it's just that in English, that's
    not the primary meaning. Whether that matters or not, I don't know.)"
