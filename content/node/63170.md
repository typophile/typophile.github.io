  example doesn't work but it should illustrate what I'm aiming for.\r\n\r\nfeature
  calt {\r\n   # if a is followed by by b, shift a 100u y direction\r\n   sub a' b
  by pos a <0 100 0 0>;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a hint if/how this can
  be done.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMartin"

  body: "GSUB and GPOS are independently processed, with all GSUB being performed
    before any GPOS is applied. It is technically possible to mix GSUB and GPOS lookups
    in the same feature, and to include GPOS lookups in a GSUB feature such as \u2018calt\u2019,
    but this is very strongly discouraged. You can't rely on layout engines applying
    GPOS lookups that occur in a GSUB feature, because if the engine considers e.g.
    \u2018calt\u2019 to be a GSUB feature, as the feature description in the OT spex
    appendix indicates it to be, then that feature might not be processed during GPOS
    operations.\r\n\r\nWhat you seem to be describing is a GPOS operation involving
    a contextual single adjustment. I would experiment with putting this in the \u2018kern\u2019
    feature, since it is fundamentally an adjustment involving the spatial relationship
    of two base glyphs. I don't use the Adobe FDK or FontLab for OTL work, so I don't
    know what limitations or assumptions might exist for the \u2018kern\u2019 feature
    in those tools, e.g. if they might presume all kerning lookups to be pair adjustments.
    I do know that in VOLT it is no problem to include any kind of GPOS lookup within
    \u2018kern\u2019, and I regularly use contextual single adjustments in that feature."

  body: "Yes, like in VOLT you can add a separate lookup to the kern feature, but
    need to compile with either the new AFDKO (not from within FLS5) or OTMaster.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature
    kern {\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup kern_jumpingGlyphs {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pos
    a' <0 100 0 0> b;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} kern_jumpingGlyphs;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
    kern;\r\n\r\nThe marked glyph is the input glyph to be repositioned, and the value
    record needs to follow immediately.\r\n\r\nBut you need to be careful: Substitution
    can be executed only once on an input glyph (after substitution it does not exist
    any more in the glyph string). But if you reposition the same glyph again in other
    lookups, all of these adjustments will add up.\r\n\r\nKarsten"
