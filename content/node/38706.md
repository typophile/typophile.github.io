body: "I want to use a bold sans serif. I've been working with Franklin Gothic in
  heavy and book, because it has a really friendly personality. I just want something
  with radius corners instead of sharp corners. I've been searching pretty carefully
  but everything is either too stylized or retro or playful. I'm just looking for
  something simple and sophisticated that looks wholesome and good-natured.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any input!"

    You could also check out <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/corbel.htm>Corbel</a>
    (part of the new MS Office package) and <a href=http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=6>Enclave</a>,
    which is a rounded slab serif. And this is getting further away from your request,
    but several of Sumner Stone's designs, <a href=http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/silicaoverview.html>Silica</a>,
    <a href=http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/magmaoverview.html>Magma</a>, and <a href=http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/stonehumanistsan.html>Stone
    Humanist Sans</a>, could fit the bill of being warm and bold but sophisticated.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions.\r\nAnd I'm seeing some faces I haven't seen before.\r\n\r\nI've
    included an uppercase \"H\" that I customized quickly from Franklin Gothic Demi
    Condensed. Instead of being rounded ALL THE WAY AROUND like VAG or Gotham, it
    just has rounded corners. Has anyone seen something like this?\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H_6043.jpg]"
