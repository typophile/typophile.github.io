  body: Hrant -- <BR> <BR>I remain mystified about what you mean when you say that
    <i>BusinessWeek</i> does Fenway greater &#34;justice&#34; than <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.
    <BR> <BR>If you&#39;d said you prefer BW to SI, then so be it -- to each his own.  <BR>
    <BR>But &#34;justice&#34;? <BR> <BR><i>Sports Illustrated</i> is, of course, the
    client for whom Carter designed Fenway. They use it, basically, at the size for
    which it was originally intended and at the default spacing that Carter gave it.
    Mostly, I believe, they use it at 9 point &#40;on 11&#41;. Carter has cited Fleischmann&#39;s
    smaller types &#40;approx. 8 pt&#41; as an inspiration. <BR> <BR>I have no quibble
    with <i>BusinessWeek</i>&#39;s setting &#40;except that inexplicable thing with
    the f-ligature spacing&#41;. But why do you say that setting Fenway with tighter
    tracking and less leading is doing it more &#34;justice&#34;? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    been a while since I compared the two settings directly, but mostly what I recall
    is that BW is set tighter with less leading, and SI has H&amp;Js that vary letterspacing
    a little more &#40;too much for my taste&#41;.  <BR> <BR>BTW, I recall noticing
    recently that another magazine has adopted Fenway for text, but I can&#39;t remember
    exactly which -- some men&#39;s health magazine or something, I think. <BR> <BR>--

    SI uses Fenway exactly the way Carter spaced it, as near as I can tell from what
    I have. &#40;John might be able to corroborate this, if he wants to take the time
    to compare SI and his copy of Fenway.&#41; So you are in fact criticizing Carter&#39;s
    spacing. Fine, no problem. I&#39;m sure Matthew would not claim to be perfect,
    and everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinion; but I just thought you should realize
    that. <BR> <BR>I think <i>Men&#39;s Fitness</i> is probably using Farnham, but
    that could have been what I saw and didn&#39;t look close enough.  <BR> <BR>Daniel,
    <i>Esquire</i> uses Hoefler&#39;s Mercury -- which is based on some of the same
    models as Carter&#39;s Fenway, with a similar stylistic approach, so it&#39;s
    easy to confuse them. <BR> <BR>Constantin, sorry to further the tangent to &#34;your&#34;
    thread.  <BR> <BR>But your initial query is somewhat contradictory. You ask for
    &#34;an honest top-10-fonts-list of the fonts you most use&#34;; but later refer
    to a &#34;fav 10&#34;. These are not necessarily going to be the same list. As
    John implies in his post, a list of favorites will not necessarily include fonts
    that are most used, depending upon the needs of one&#39;s projects, and vice versa.

    of 1999-2000 &#40;wonderfully set by Maxim Zhukov&#41; and the Fenway in there
    &#40;at a larger point size&#41; seems to work great; so I assumed that it&#39;s
    spaced tighter than an SI. But then I scanned it up, and you&#39;re right - it&#39;s
    the same! This is especially strange because the point size in SI is smaller,
    which means more looseness would be better, but then how could the BW setting
    look better?! Well, it did to me at least. <BR> <BR>But maybe my memory of the
    SI/BW difference has been flipped? That would surprise me though. Or is it possible
    that the too-great <i>leading</i> in SI &#40;which we agree on&#41; is making

    you think that Vendetta could be used with Truesdell? Following Dwig&#39;s M-Theory
    the angularity of Vendetta could be used as text and Truesdell could be used as
    Display. Truesdell is a pain to work with, but it is beautiful. I wish they&#39;d
    update it, it seems the way it was digitized ... well, I find myself to typographic
    acrobatics to use lining and ranging figures at different times. '

  body: But Vendetta&#39;s angularity is not WAD-style. <BR>It&#39;s a &#34;discretization&#34;
    of the strokes &#40;both sides&#41;, not an optical effect in the counters. <BR>
