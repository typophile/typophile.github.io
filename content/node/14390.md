body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : Vyaz'</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Vyaz'</em> is a decorative
  style of [[Cyrillic]] [[calligraphy]] characterised by tall, condensed and interlocking
  letters forming a dense and continous band of text. The style originated in Byzantine
  (Greek) books in the 11th century, and is related to the style of Greek [[uncial]]
  lettering employed in Orthodox icons. It spread in Russia and flourished particularly
  in the 16th century. Three kinds of interlocking are typically found in <em>vyaz'</em>
  lettering: stem ligation in which adjacent letters share a common stem, letters
  or parts of letters stacked vertically, and enclosure of smaller letters within
  larger ones.\r\n\r\nMaxim Zhukov provides the fine attached example.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vyaz.gif]\r\n\r\nThread:
