body: "Hi\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is my first time actually posting on the forum,
  so hello all.\r\n\r\nIm afraid its a little moment of panic i find myself in, as
  I post this. Im currently working on some projects for a client using @font-face.
  It's the first project we're really putting any effort into using @font-face on
  and its been a little bit of a nightmare to be honest. We were currently planning
  on using Trade Gothic above 15pt and Droid Sans (and Droid Sans Mono in tables).\r\n\r\nWe
  are having to give up on the Droid due to hinting issues (its designed to work on
  high PPI screens and doesn't seem to be hand hinted) and we're now looking for an
  alternative typeface to use below 15pt which resembles trade gothic in basic appearance,
  is hand hinted for use on screen and can be self hosted (due to security on the
  client side).\r\n\r\nThe options for monospace and regular don't have to be matching
  typefaces (but ideally should be) as long as they both looks alike below 15pt.\r\n\r\nI
  think thats all you should need to know to be able to help (sorry brains not in
  gear today, let me know if I've missed anything)\r\n\r\nMatt Noble"

    dropped you a mail.

    things (swiss finance company).
