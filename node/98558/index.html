<p>my boss asked me to provide a logo for our experiment so I put together some ideas, but I am looking for help since I am not a professional designer nor I am planning to become one.
These ideas come after various iterations with the boss, so I have to stuck with Skia since he likes it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>&lsquo;Apotema&rsquo; means Apothem but it has nothing to do with the meaning of the word. It is just an acronym. With this experiment we aim to produce Technetium, that is a radioactive source used for scintigraphy, with a cyclotron, that is a particle accelerator. In a cyclotron, particles are put in the center and are accelerated following a spiral trajectory inside a cylindrical cavity and come out from one of more wholes on the side of the cylinder. The generated beam is forced to go through some tubing and just outside the cylinder it is forced to bend.</p>
<p>The upper left logo is just centered on the meaning of apothem, so I used a regular polygon and emphasized one of its apothems.
The other logos are more centered on the experiment itself. The &lsquo;o&rsquo; symbolizes the cyclotron and the lines, coming out of it, symbolize the tubing in which the beam goes along with the bend. The spiral inside the &lsquo;o&rsquo; is the particle trajectory.</p>

<p>Most companies wouldn&rsquo;t think of asking an employee to do their bookkeeping, or prepare legal papers, or even fix their plumbing, if that staffer was not experienced in that area. They&rsquo;d hire a pro instead and view it as part of the cost of doing business. But when it comes to design, companies often use the do-it-yourself approach, usually with bad results.</p>

<p>I did not take it as a criticism toward me, as I myself admit that this is not my work and I am trying to do my best. I share your views about companies, people usually think that graphics design is easy to do because everybody can have all the tools that pros use but this is not enough. Plus Physicist are usually very bad at graphics, for instance take a look at [[http://www.srim.org/|SRIM]]:

<p>The rounding of the terminals and turns (do even more for the latter though) looks good, but I have to apologize for suggesting thinning the joins - that was a knee-jerk reaction and did not consider the nature of Biome&hellip; Actually you need to make the joins <em>thicker</em>. :-/ In fact even filling-in, like the joins in Biome. Also, I would use a darker weight, and space the letters tighter. And shorten the descender of the &ldquo;p&rdquo; (it seems to be overshooting the bottom spiral arm). Lastly, the overshoots of the spiral arms are different: the top-left one seems to be going further out than the bottom-right one; I would shoot for the latter degree.</p>
<p>BTW, if you really have settled on Biome you might consider making the spiral arms shallow arcs, not totally straight.</p>

<p>@James - I know what your comment is directed at. I think I&rsquo;ve seen pretty much all flavours of &ldquo;No spec work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hire a designer&rdquo; comments there&rsquo;s to see. The problem is that they are never constructive. Frankly, I was twice as surprised to see it coming from you given how routinely helpful you are with this sort of questions.</p>

<p>Bingo.
One great reason to help is it makes people more aware of how hard it is to do it right, making them more likely to hire a designer in the future. There&rsquo;s no use pressuring people into paying us - you need to lay it on soft.</p>

<p>In this case, with the poster talking about using a cyclotron — a very expensive piece of equipment, and one that you&rsquo;d expect to be handled by well-paid engineers and scientists — I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that the budgets were considerably larger.

<p>Yes a cyclotron is a very expensive apparatus but the problem is that the people working on it are not well-paid, at least here in Italy. A plumber here earns more money per hour than what I am paid for giving lessons at the University.</p>
<p>By the way, our institute does have an official [[http://www.infn.it/comunicazione/|pubblic relationships office]]. I think that office should be the one taking care of the design of experiments logos and such. I am wondering, though, why is the official website for the PR office not even in english?
Here are some examples of their editorial production:

<p>As a fellow physicist, I have to agree with you — our community is crawling with typographic crimes, with the use of red-on-blue Comic Sans on PowerPoint slides ranking among the mildest. Logos are particularly bad. The one linked below is a pretty mild case for science standards, just rather shrill, impractical, and unrefined. It represents a large-budget international consortium of European scientists that have been designing and building an instrument for the Very Large Telescope for the past 10 years or so. I haven&rsquo;t even tried to propose an alternative because it&rsquo;s so well-entrenched and design just seems to be everybody&rsquo;s lowest priority.</p>

<p>And no, just because we get to use hugely expensive accelerators and telescopes doesn&rsquo;t mean we get paid well.  :(  The problem is that we&rsquo;re enthusiastic enough about our work to endure underpayment, non-existent job security, and the need to move to another country every 2–3 years.</p>

<p>I had an uncle who was a nuclear physicist. His first job was being a lab assistant on the Manhattan Project during the secret development of the atom bomb during World War II (he was in a betting pool at the lab on the yield of the bomb&rsquo;s first test and he bet it wouldn&rsquo;t work), and then he went on to work as a scientist at the Las Alamos Nationals Labs his entire career. But I never got the feeling that his income was high — always lived in a modest home, drove used cars, etc.</p>
