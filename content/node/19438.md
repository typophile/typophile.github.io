  body: "I have wondered this myself. I love the new series! But that is an awful
    font ;-)\r\n\r\nOn Doctor Who Confidential last season, they interviewed one of
    the graphic designers who created a lot of the visuals for the series. For some
    of the scene work, she did her own digital lettering. Maybe the logo for the series
    was completely done in house by the BBC, too."

  body: "I live in the US so I have to download the episodes with bit torrent after
    they're broadcast in the UK, and haven't downloaded any Who Confidential episodes,
    are they worth it, or should I wait for the DVDs? (I'm assuming the best of the
    confidential would be bonus features on a DVD).\r\nAlso, there's a layered PSD
    of the logo floating around on the interwebs, but the text layer is rasterized
    so there's no information about what the font is called. Whatthefont doesn't have
    anything useful, either, so maybe it was in house."

  body: "I bought the first series on DVD in November, and saw Confidential then.
    I live in Germany, and we have the same DVD encoding here that they use in the
    UK.\r\n\r\nAnyway, why wait until July to buy the US DVDs? Season 1 has been on
    sale in North American format in Canada since February. Amazon.ca ships to the
    US, too. It just costs a bit more\u2026\r\n\r\nI noticed on your profile that
    you are from Maryland. I'm from Baltimore originally, and grew up watching the
    old Doctor Who on MPT! \r\n\r\nI've seen some \"Doctor Who\" free fonts on the
    internet, but they all looked auto-traced."
