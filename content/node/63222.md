  this isnt a one time deal and I'll definately be hanging around now I've had a look
  around!\r\n\r\nIm desperate to identify a font I found in an australian/new zealand
  design magazine called \"indesign\". The art directors listed for the magazine are
  one8one7.com, On there homepage they have an image with the font in question (6
  large images down on the home page)- I've emailed them but with no response so im
  hoping someone here can identify it for me. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for reading
  this and I look forward to a response!\r\n"

    but it is certainly not the same. Did you check to see if the magazine has a place
    where they list fonts that are used? Many design-oriented publications do include
    some sort of Colophon, on the same page where they list their Editors and Designers.\r\n\r\n-
