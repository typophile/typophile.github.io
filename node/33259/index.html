I feel really bad about my design now so please Nathan, if you had to laugh, atleast you could have told me why :( Don't just laugh and not tell me.
Z.D.Smith, the 10 is meant to look like a face and it's also meant to look like 1 degree becausethe book is for the end of yr degree show and also because of the 10th anniversary of the higher education at the college. Is it still funny now? I feel crap about my work now. please encourage, not discourage. You have put my cinfidence really down, like beyond ground level :(</div>

I have never seen that. Nathan is 'laughing' because that's just his Avatar or Icon. It's not directed at you. It looks like that all the time.

I think the 1 degree & 10 think isn't quite gelling yet. Keep going. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">you ask for opinions then sulk when you think someone is laughing! as the wise Chopper Reid says, Youll really have to harden the fuck up if you want to survive as a designer in the real world!! I would not put work up here just to get a confidence boost, the wrong place. 

the idea is sound, but yer excecution has to be much sharper to catch employers attention. IMHO

Eben: Thank you for making it clear to me that I am not being laughed at. LMAO means (see above).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, so here goes. On top of that, I have come up with 10 commandments kind of idea but for students i.e. I am going to be using words that have the word TEN within it so 'atTENtion', 'inTENtion' etc so it will tie in with my theme of 'maximise your poTENtial'. What do you think? And could i pull it off by saying that the 10 could be understood as 1 degree as in this is your one and only degree' or 'this is it!, your 1st degree' or could you think of anything else I could say about the 1 degree which is also meant to be a number 10 and a face too or am i confusing my audience?</div>
