body: Can anyone put a name to these letters? I know I&#39;ve seen the first one before
  but I can&#39;t think where. I&#39;ve looked at Solotype and Spiece Graphics and
  Nick&#39;s Fonts and have struck out. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49991.jpg"

  body: Middle one is a Venitian of some kind, although a really funky cut with those
    concave serifs. Cleaner, more regularized digitizations include <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/golden-type-ef/golden-type-original/testdrive.html">ITC
    Golden</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/nicolas-jenson-sg/regular/testdrive.html">Nicolas
    Jenson</a> from Spiece. <BR> <BR>For the last one, try something from Dan Solo.
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/excelsis/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Best+5c.+cigar">Excelsis</a>
    is a decent match, but you might be able to get even closer. <BR> <BR>The first
    one has me stumped. It resembles <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/britannic/medium/testdrive.html?s=DROP+ONE+CENT+IN+THE+SLOT&amp;p=36">Brittanic</a>,
    but is obviously funkier. G&#39;luck!

  body: The first one has some similarities with Globe Extended. I could swear I&#39;ve
    seen it somewhere. It&#39;s driving me crazy!

    target="_blank">McKenna Bold</a> gives a very similar feeling to the second example,
    even though it&#39;s not an exact character match. I have the same font with the
    name &#34;Colwell&#34;.

  body: the last one looks alot like Ambrosia from Letterhead... the g isnt right
    but it would probably be easy to modify
