  body: "Or [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html|Part 11, Everyday Hand-printing]]
    in the Script Guide. I already checked Part 12 of the Guide,  and Stephen's list,
    but didn't see a match. They may be shown in Part 11, or they may be at Dafont,
    or they may be anywhere.  As we have said many times, hand-printed fonts are so
    easy to make that they could be custom one-time fonts, and you would never know.\r\n\r\n-
