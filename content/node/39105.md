body: "For those of you stuck in Illustrator/Inkscape or some other such vector malarky,
  you might want to give [[http://vectormagic.stanford.edu|this]] a quick look.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a free web app that incredibly quickly converts your raster images to vector. I'm
  seriously impressed - it easily out performs Illustrator's Live Trace by a factor
  of lots.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a mention here and if this is old news, I apologise.
  Sod it, no I don't, go and have a look, it's fantastic. :)\r\n\r\ns"

  body: Nice. But the Live Trace of Illustrator CS3 is actually not that bad. It's
    quite good to be honest. I never used it, but I had to a couple of days ago, and
    I was pleasantly surprised. But Vectormagic, as a web application, is definitly
    very impressive. :)

    look into more at work on Monday. Have a good weekend.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: Looks like it's now become a paysite. Oh well. Fun while it was free; most
    people probably will find other utilities now that it costs.
