body: "Greetings all,\r\n\r\nI made this design last week, for a friend of mine who's
  in e-commerce and web shops. I got the idea from some free font which was really
  terribly constructed, but now it's turned into something completely different. He
  likes it very much, and so do I. Yet I wonder if it is worth persuing? I know there
  are so many lookalikes out there...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rensz_3818.png]"

    the rounded portions of 'a', 'e' and 's' stand out me against the contours of
    the other characters. Thoughts?"

  body: "I prefer the contours of the 's' very much. I also enjoy the subtle curves
    in the 'v' and 'w'. I'm not a fan of the open 'p,q,b,d and e' or at least they
    feel a little too open\r\n\r\nThe rest of the letters feel a little curmudgeon
    where their curves terminate into straight verticals. It feels forced/stubborn.
    There has to be a more natural solution for that.\r\n\r\nIt has potential to be
    very excellent. I'd love to see what this looks like EXTRA BOLD.   "

  body: "So far it's been pretty easy.\r\nNow I suggest you do the ultra bold.\r\nThat
    will be quite hard (most people who do this kind of face don't get heavier than
    a medium-weight bold), but it will resolve a lot of issues, ultimately save you
    a lot of hassle, and set the face apart from the crowd.\r\nIf you are serious
    about developing the face, it's best to tackle the ultra now, and interpolate
    between that and this."

    Roman glyph set, almost finished (petite, text and tabular numerals included).
    Once I get all <cite>look and feel</cite> parameters right, I'll start with an
    ultra bold and perhaps small caps.\r\nWhen all goes well, this could turn out
    to be quite an extensive family!\r\nThanks again, back to regular work now ;-)"

    righty then. Work is done so I spent some time sketching a possible UltraBold

    PDF).\r\n\r\nWhen you go this heavy, a lot of the little details on the lighter
    weights become magnified exponentially. The awkward looking k, the extremely think
    negative spaces are too thin, the curves don't feel fluid or natural. \r\n\r\nYou're
    ultra is going to need a complete full body makeover, I'm afraid. "

  body: "Another great design, Jean Paul. I second other's opinion, it surely must
    be developed. Simple, clean and handsome. And Nick's idea is excellent. I'd like
    to think about this (to begin with thin/black weights) a few months ago.\r\n\r\nSome
    points: (1) your parenthesis are very far away from usual shape. Maybe a simple
    curve would be better. (2) zero could be more curve on top/bottom parts. (3) W
    is somewhat heavy. Do you tried to do it with two unlinked pieces? (I mean, a
    kind of U with inclined stems and a small v inside).\r\n\r\nAbout the ultra black,
    I also agree with Eliason, you 3rd PDF is much better."

    updated the PDF. Zero could indeed be more different from /o/, I'll try rounding
    it more. Good idea about /w/, I'll give it a try."
