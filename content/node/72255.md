body: "Hi there, hopefully someone can offer some information. I am trying to find
  digital matches if possible (or close match)\r\nfor three fonts from a 1920s publication.
  I'm particularly keen to identify the serif. These would have course \r\nbeen printed
  with hot metal, but curious to know if they exist as digital versions.\r\n\r\nThey
  are as follows:\r\n\r\nhttp://i31.tinypic.com/54amgp.jpg\r\nhttp://i32.tinypic.com/23rn0cx.jpg\r\nhttp://i29.tinypic.com/hrzwyc.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I have seen the original publication, and it's printed very crisply with hot metal.\r\n\r\nW1"

  body: Font Bureau's Vonness Expanded Black is a decent match for the extended sans.
    A more readily available alternative would be Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Extended.

  body: For number two, you might try Sacker's Gothic or Engraver's Gothic though
    your sample is a bit thicker than those two.
