    Hamilton: You need money.\r\nJeff Spicoli: All I need are some tasty waves, a
    cool buzz, and I'm fine."

  body: The concept is approved. The dilemma is deciding which 'a' is better suited
    to adding to the growing alphabet.

  body: I'd go with the taller a. The short a seems squished and is even a bit hard
    to read as an a.

  body: "The counter is rounder/squatter to keep the horizontals equal width with
    the other letters. The outside of the bowl is equal to the g's and shorter than
    the xheight.\r\n\r\nThe e's counter (including the open counter, ignoring the
    bar) is equal to the proportions of the c, o, d, b, p and q's counters. Though
    the p and q might change."

  body: "I think that the \"taller\" a wins hands down. The other a doesn't look so
    healthy. However, I think that you might be taking the wrong direction by basing
    the a on the o. I think that the a would be much better if it took after the n.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that the a and the e always have to match. But they should be ballanced,"

  body: Since I don't think I like either, but agree that the taller is more legible,
    I'll look at the 'n'.
