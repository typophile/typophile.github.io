  by people that seem smarter than you? <BR> <BR>Worry no more! Now you can sound
  like a pro with the Typophile  <BR>Small Talk Generator, version 1.3: TypeCon Edition.
  <BR> <BR>Try it now. It&#39;s free. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/smalltalk/"

  <BR> <BR>Caution: The Small Talk Generator will have you sounding suave,  <BR>but
  it cannot guarantee you a good score on the famed TypeCon  <BR>type quiz. For that
  you&#39;ll need a miracle, or at least some  <BR>personal coaching from Kent Lew
  or Tiffany Wardle.'
