body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm trying to find the typeface used in Massin book (by Laetitia
  Wolff). Looks kind of like poster bodoni italic, except it isn't italic. Where to
  buy it?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "This doesn't look too familiar. The only Roman I can think of with this kind
    of contrast and ball terminals on the 's' is Firenze, which we have [[http://typophile.com/node/20844|discussed
    before]]. The Firenze m is not like this one. I don't know of a digital version
    except for the old Image Club Letterpress collection, although it was suggested
    that a font called Florence is the same typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Good one Stewf. I'll need to mark that in my notes about ball terminal fonts.
    That typeface has been around more than 40 years, but I've never noticed it much.\r\n\r\n-
