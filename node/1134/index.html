		<div class="commentbody">The logotype is a graphic, not text. That's the bottom line.  <BR> <BR>I had this problem years ago, working for an organization that was changing its name &amp; identity. The new logotype was all-lowercase. Everyone thought they had to write the org's name that way. I'm not sure why it was so hard to get them to understand the difference between the graphical treatment and the name itself, but it took a long time to get it to sink in. I stressed the difference between the logotype, which is a graphic (like a picture, I said), and the name itself. I pointed out Boeing's logotype, which is in all caps: when you refer to Boeing do you write BOEING? I even resorted to using the Coca-Cola logotype: If you refer to Coca-Cola, do you type it in red curly script? I think that last one finally helped. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The mention of Adidas (is the name itself really supposed to be lc, like e.e. cummings?) reminds me: around the same time, I collected a bunch of all-lc logos and made a handout showing that lots of companies have that kind of logotype, but that names (i.e. proper nouns) are always written with initial caps and internal lc. If it would be useful, I'll see if I can dig it up. <BR> <BR>Re: small caps &ndash; I don't know what kind of company Nathan's client is, but it's pretty doubtful that they'd be able to use small caps company-wide in all applications (that is, people writing or typing the company name, as opposed to printing the logo).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yep, small caps would pose a logistical problem.  And would likely not be adapted company wide. <BR> <BR>I'm also not sure if visually I agree with any caps at all &ndash; except in the logo. <BR> <BR>I like the readability point &ndash; any hard data I can point to for that? <BR> <BR>Another thing to consider is the headlines used in corporate literature.  They use an endorsed brand architecture similar to that of redhat or adobe (ie. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) <BR> <BR>What you'll notice is the corporate signature is not integrated into the actual headline, but is used to sign the page.  The headline is arranged with secondary type only so the corporate name is displayed with secondary type consistent with the product name. <BR> <BR>Sometimes these branding architectures for headlines use a cascading model where you would also see a tagline. <BR> <BR>So my problem is also in developing a consistent look that communicates things correctly.  Having the company name as caps (i.e. UNICON Product) takes the focus away from the product.  Which is not consistent with the brand architecture strategy they're going with. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on this? <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is actually one rare place where a unicase design (assuming we're really talking about a logo and not orthography) might work great. It would satisfy some of the &quot;UC envy&quot;, but also force a clean break with the idea that the capitalization has to be the same in text (since a unicase would make that effectively impossible). <BR> <BR>As for the lower readability of all-caps, there is empirical evidence all over the place, but it doesn't apply to a single word you have all the time in the world to read. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This confusion between the concepts of &quot;name&quot; and &quot;logotype&quot; seems common. I've even had clients who always tried writing their name in their logo font and colour (a la the Coca-Cola example), or even sticking their logo into bodies of text in place of a name! I keep reading, in magazines, designers who say that clients are &quot;getting smarter&quot;. I don't think so. <BR> <BR>Part of the problem may be that logo/identity designers aren't providing logo <i>and</i> editorial guidelines for new company names and identities. Editorial guidelines will say what the company's name actually is, and how it is to be spelled. <BR> <BR>Remind your client that a logo is a <i>symbol</i>, not a word, even if it has letters in it. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not sure how you're separating a branding issue from a visual design one. <BR> <BR>My view is that it's all visual communications (and more when considering branding / brand strategy).  Since there are both implicit and explicit messages to any visual communication program, having technical issues with the visual design can imply negative messages about the company. <BR> <BR>My view, based on my connection with the company vision, is that it's more a crutch than anything else.  They want it to stand out.  But it doesn't integrate elegantly into the overall design system.  But, when dealing with folks on the business side of the fence, it's not always easy to make a case for elegant design.  So I was wondering if anyone has come across this issue and what if any tactics they used to deal with it. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Nathan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dunno how receptive they are to plain logic, but it's a simple and accepted rule of usage that proper nouns are written with initial caps, not all caps. When a company name appears in all caps, one assumes it's an acronym, and will then wonder what the initials stand for. <BR> <BR>Writing in all caps is like adding extra exclamation points. It doesn't say &quot;this is extra important&quot; &ndash; it says &quot;we know <i> you</i> don't think this is as important as <i> we</i> think it is.&quot;</div>
