  and i'm looking for some kind of vintage typeface to go along with it. I'm trying
  to simulate a vintage poster from the 20s up to 50s, as the book is about a sculptor
  from that time.\r\n\r\nHere are some links to some works that are similar to what
  I have in mind:\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/karenhorton/2149982374/in/pool-vtype\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/karenhorton/2149997100/in/photostream/\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/apricot_x/1404181266/in/pool-vtype\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/sarahbrownandpink/1082929956/in/pool-vtype\r\n\r\nFrom
  what I could see, people really liked to use typefaces in an ascendent slope.\r\n\r\nPlease
  excuse my engrish!\r\nMarco"

    don't know anything about South American foundries, so I'm making some assumptions
    here--that the subject of the book is South American, and that the Gans typefaces
    would have been popular in South America during the 20s--50s, or at least have
    a similar Latin personality to ones that were popular then and there."
