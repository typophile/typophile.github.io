  However, trying different fonts for body copy in a book I'm designing right now,
  Miller looked just right \u2013 thus I've decided to use it.\r\nIs this a faux pas?\r\nAre
  there any cultural connotations or traditions regarding Scotch Romans that I am
  not aware of?\r\nWill I be laughed at by typophiles?\r\nThe book is printed on cheap
  uncoated paper \u2013 isn't this one reason a newspaper font would actually work
  better?\r\n\r\nOn the cover I used a combination of Neutra and Miller Display Italics.\r\nAgain,
  did I go wrong here?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover_6103.jpg]"

    type should match the text.\r\n\r\nScotches are truly beautiful! \r\n\r\nMatthew
    Carter designed Miller with newspapers and magazines in mind. And since you are
    using Miller Daily, even more so. It has the most \u201Cliterary\u201D feel of
    the do-it-all scotch systems lately. Chronicle is the most sterile.  The only
    thing that concerns me is that Miller Daily has (I think) shorter descenders and
    ascenders.  These are key for reader cognition.\r\n\r\nPeople set books in Times
    all the time- does it look great? - not award winningly so, but Miller is much
    better than Times. \r\n\r\nYour cover is lovely!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPS...
    Why are you using cheap paper for a book? "

  body: "Thanks Mikey,\r\n\r\nAbout the book: actually there will be forty titles
    or so in this series. The assignment is from a medical publisher, they wanted
    something simple and clear for their new paperback editions to be sold in pharmacies,
    supermarkets and kiosks here in Finland. As the titles vary from depression to
    insomnia and smoking I decided to do something generic. The color in the upper
    Fibonacci section will always be a different PMS spot and the little black supersharp
    1-bit image will change with the theme. Besides that, they'll be uniform.  The
    texts are prose - or kind of ... so I felt that a \"medical\" font would feel
    too cold. The idea here is to get close to the reader with rather difficult issues.\r\nI
    myself come from a magazine design background. Maybe that's why I went for Miller
    and the descenders and ascenders feel ok to me. Somehow finnish looks better that
    way ...\r\nThe paper was already chosen before I was called in, and it's not super
    bad ...\r\nBy the way, I tried Chronicle. Didn't work."

    in the 1960s and 70s. Remember, this was fairly early days for using photocomposition
    for books, and both New Caledonia and Century Expanded printed well. That ability
    to print well was one of the primary concerns of books designers of that period.\r\n\r\nPostScript
    Caledonia was a disaster -- too thin -- and use Century Expanded has faded, perhaps
    due to the limited character complement. Each generation seems to revive fonts,
    either directly as with \"Bembo Book\" or less directly, as with Miller.\r\n\r\nPostScript
    Monticello is another Scotch-based font beginning to be used; Carter did the PostScript
    version on a commission from Princeton University Press, but it is generally available
    from Carter & Cone as a Type 1 font with old-style numbers, small capitals, and
    full ligatures.\r\n\r\nI imagine Miller will print fine on the cheap paper selected,
    but that would be something to check.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    \r\n\r\nMiller Daily is a part of the Font Bureau Readability series and is not
    available through the Font Bureau retail library. I don't think licenses are available
    for less than 10 installed stations, starting at $600 per style. So I'm curious
    how you have it to use.\r\n\r\nI have set several books in Miller and it is a
    good workhorse typeface. But I would recommend Miller Text for book composition.
    The proportions are better suited. \r\n\r\nMiller Daily has a larger x-height,
    considerably shorter ascenders and descenders, slightly smaller caps, and a generally
    narrower set width. All typical adaptations for newspaper use. Also, it is produced
    in a variety of grades, so the color on the page can depend upon the grade that
    you're using.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    I think the publisher will appreciate this more economic option.\r\nThe grade

    or?..\r\nAnd yes, it's a postman. A very depressed postman. \"Masennus\" is depression

  body: "Miller has almost become the \"house face\" where I work. Both I and at least
    3 freelance designers with whom I work have all gotten Miller, independently of
    one another. I find it completely suitable for a wide range of trade and academic
    publishing. The color is great, the letter fitting is fine.\r\n\r\nScotch Romans
    from Monotype and Linotype never pleased me very much, in metal or photo, computer
    or PostScript versions. Letter fitting was never quite right, and they were too
    dark for my eye. When I once designed a lengthy book in Monotype Scotch Roman,
    we had the composition house re-arrange the matrix case, substituting the caps
    with caps one size smaller. Ten-point caps with eleven-point lowers, etc. True,
    the caps looked a tad light. But overall they reduced the too-dark page color.\r\n\r\nPostScript
    Scotch was never refined until Carter set to work on Miller. He pulled it off.
    The only thing I do not like about it is that he put a \"flat-footed\" R in the
    shift+R position, and the \"curly-footed\" R in an alt position. To my eye the
    curly-foot R is the better one. I am not sure which R is more historically accurate.
    But I don't care; I'm happy it is there.\r\n\r\nWe print Miller on Glatfelter
    Natures Book, 55# and 60#. It looks great. If it is a duotone or 4-c book printed
    in China, we use a 128gsm matte-coated art paper. It also looks fine on that stock.
    Now that's a good test of a type: if it looks good on both coated and uncoated.\r\n\r\nIf
    I ever end up on that proverbial desert island with a computer, I want to have
    Miller with me. Long Live Miller!\r\n\r\npowers"

    he went off to the Production Manager's meeting in Chicago. We sort of had the
    same ones, but our real conclusion was that they were fonts we new how to use.  And
    I think that's the key; while you need to appreciate them, you go to them because
    you now how to make them work.

    variations you can get for Mercury are similar to the ones that were done for
    Miller Daily. Or Bureau Roman or Poynter Oldstyle Text -- FB revived the practice
    of graded types for newspapers first. H&FJ followed suit with Mercury and Chronicle."

  body: "For James Montalbano> \r\n\r\nThe typeface should match the context and technical
    requirements of the text. \r\n\r\nA period romance novel would look nice set in
    something like Adobe Garamond Premier- designed for extended reading and a little
    rustic. \r\n\r\nIf I was setting a book on early southern California Mexican poetry
    I might use Relato, Rongel, Elmhurst, Andralis, or Merlo. According to Eduardo
    Manso, Relato was in fact designed for shorter reads- perfect for poetry.\r\n\r\nIf
    I was setting a young girls poetry book I might use Odile. \r\n\r\nEplica or Nexus
    Serif also have a poetic feel but a little harder edged. \r\n\r\nNon-fictional
    texts or informational texts such as Jesper\u2019s book dealing with personal
    heath- Miller is a perfect match. A little newsy, but it still has a warmth to
    it. Whereas, Chronicle is corporate and would be fabulous in publication in dealing
    with a subject like personal finance.\r\n\r\nSome technical considerations are
    paper quality, page size, and ink. \r\nJunky paper would necessitate a font like
    Karmina, Clarendon or Oranda to be used. \r\nA narrow font would be appropriate
    for a the tight space of a magazine.\r\nPrinting with UV inks would necessitate
    using a slightly more blunt grade of, lets say, Mercury because the ink will not
    bleed as readily with UV ink creating a really spiky look. Some fonts look terrible
    on glossy magazine paper. \r\n\r\nI usually think about the way the type makes
    me feel and then winnow choices down.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Font Bureau recommend
    the Miller is recommend for use with Newspapers and Magazines.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPS...
