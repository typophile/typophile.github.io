  because it is similar to the custom font used by Italian publisher Einaudi.\r\nI
  have a few questions for you. ;-)\r\n\r\n\u2013 Which is the best version in circulation
  of this typeface (Adobe, Linotype, ...) and where you advise me to buy it (myfonts.com,
  fonts.com, ...)?\r\n\u2013 Do you know of interesting variations? (I like the \"tall,
  rangy and delicate\" design  of this font).\r\n\u2013 None of the versions of which
  I am aware integrates IPA phonetic characters: you confirm this? :-(\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\nMirko\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Mirko,\r\n\r\nthe best available digital version is Garamond Simoncini
    EF by Elsner and Flake (previously in the Scangraphic catalogue), which mantains
    the typical inktraps feature of the original metal typeface and has - as a separate
    font - the small caps and old style figures, but in the roman only. Unfortunately,
    the old style figures aren't particulary well spaced. The other versions - commonly
    named \"Simoncini Garamond\" - are lighter. Einaudi's typeface (now named \"Einaudi
    Garamond\") is a completely different face, and, as you perhaps already know,
    is not available commercially. And yes, I confirm that the phonetic glyphs are
    not included in any of its version.\r\n\r\nHere is the page of Garamond Simoncini
    at EF's site:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fonts4ever.com/search_result_details.php?f_item_name=Garamond%20Simoncini%20Family%20Set&view=1&set=1&subset=1&products_id=1724#familyName"

  body: "Hi! Thank you!\r\n\r\nYes, I know that Einaudi's font is not available commercially
    :-( ...and \u2013reading  discussions about it\u2013 I knew the \"Simoncini Garamond\",
    that would seem the \"most similar\" in circulation (I dont own it, so I can not
    verify).\r\n\r\nAs for the IPA symbols \u2013if there are no similar fonts that
    contain them\u2013 I think I'll have to draw (or commission) those I need (italian
    phonemes).\r\n\r\nMK"
