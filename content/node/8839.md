  body: 'Charles-- thank you very much for addressing these issues and starting a
    new thread. I am the law student in question, and this is a very interesting and
    relevant topic of discussion. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;I imagine an attorney feels it
    his/her duty to represent the client.  <BR> <BR>This is one of the fundamental
    problems of law. Type designers are, unless tied to large companies like Adobe,
    often small businesses who hire law firms, rather than in-house counsels, to draft
    their EULAs. Obviously, this means that the hired attorneys will attempt, given
    their limited expertise, to hammer out contracts that address the issues articulated
    to them by the client. Since most attorneys reveal, in candid conversation, that
    in drafting a contract in an uncertain area of law, their job is to &#34;invent
    law,&#34; it follows that lawyers cannot be expected to spearhead fundamental
    changes in law as applied to typography.  Type designers themselves are the only
    agents who can begin the process of EULA reform. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;than in a
    PS file <BR> <BR>what is a PS file? -- can someone explain, please? <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;NetLibrary
    requires the publisher, amongst other things, to send them a PDF file with the
    fonts fully embedded. <BR> <BR>What level of restriction does NetLibrary require,
    in terms of the embedding bit? I personally see no reason why NetLibrary would
    ever need rights beyond &#34;read-only.&#34; The problem is, many type foundries
    only allow embedding for in-house or non commercial use only &#40;see <a href="http://fontlab.wikidev.net/Image:Interrobang2-EULA-chart.gif">Interrobang&#39;s
    excellent comparison chart</a>&#41;. What the industry seems to need is a consistent
    policy that allows legal embedding for commercial, but read-only, uses such as
    NetLibrary. In the alternative, foundries could attempt to sign NetLibrary as
    a customer of their many fonts, but a likely conclusion is that NetLibrary, if
    faced with the prospect of licensing 1,000 fonts, would simply require its partners
    to submit in non-protected or a certain set or prescribed, cleared, fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62;&#62;The state of things is so bad now that nobody pays much &#62;&#62;attention
    to the EULA '

    I&#39;ve been working on, on and off. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t really comment on litigation
    Adobe is currently involved in, except to note that it is ongoing; the decision
    cited above is not the entire case. I also don&#39;t think Abeno&#39;s summary
    is entirely accurate in some respects, so I recommend reading the decision if
    you&#39;re interested. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: What is the entire case? The text of this legal document is written for lawyers,
    I assume. Is there any document made for Adobe users of fonts and PDF&#39;s that
    explains what the influence will be on your applications.  <BR>Is there any chance
    to get a PDF-editing &#34;full text editing&#34; technique using embedded fonts?

    <BR>apologies if i over-simplified the issue in the Afga v. Adobe case-- Adobe
    5.0 had a feature that allowed fonts embedded in PDFs to be edited with fewer
    restrictions than its bit restriction allowed. Adobe corrected this with 5.05,
    which Afga aknowledged, but sued anyway. In any case, I agree with Thomas- read
    the decision if you&#39;re that interested. My point in bringing up the case was
    to illustrate that companies are willing to litigate over the embedded PDF issue,
    not to highlight specifics of the dispute. <BR> <BR>Charles-- sorry if i missed
    your points. I&#39;m new to this area of study and in addition was drunk when
    I posted.  <BR> <BR>&#62;Your client tells you his main concern is to keep his
    fonts from being stolen.  <BR> <BR>are they being stolen in the current state
    of affairs you describe? In a sense, books on NetLibrary are simply more copies
    of the published book. Neither NetLibrary nor its customers can obtain or edit
    text in Mrs Eaves, if I understand it all correctly. <BR> <BR>&#62;I'

  body: OK, you&#39;ve just begun to take the first steps. What I&#39;m really suggesting
    is that a lawyer has to advise their clients, and in order to do that, he/she
    &#40;the lawyer&#41; has to know the business pretty well. It will be different
    for magazines than for books, different still for newspapers, and yet different
    for print advertizing. <BR> <BR>There will be permutations you don&#39;t expect.
    What you have to remember is the designer may feel that their latest creation
    is really good, everybody will buy it  . . . but it ain&#39;t necessarily so.
    It reminds me of a author who was having her book published --  a print run of
    2,500 copies. When discussing advertizing with the publisher&#39;s marketing department,
    she said &#34;What, you&#39;re not going to take out a full-page ad in the <i>New
    York Review of Books?</i> &#34; <BR> <BR>Charles
