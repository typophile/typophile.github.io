  scripr works perfect apart from the order of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe order of th4e
  glyphs seems to be completely random.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how I can change the
  order of the glyphs. I'm sure it must be something I can chnage in FL.\r\n"

    the contact sheet the accented glyphs seem to be in order, it's just the upper
    and lowercase that aren't in the correct order."

    in the Glyphs panel, so possibly what you see is with the sort order is set to
    \"Unicode\". Make sure it's set to \"Glyphs\"."

  body: The 'correct' order being ascending Unicode value, I presume. Glyph IDs are
    assigned in the order glyphs are added to the font, as far as I can tell.

  body: "I know there is no correct order as such.\r\n\r\nOK so the order in the contact
    sheet is the CID /GID order in the Glyphs window in Indesign.\r\n\r\nI want the
    order in the contact sheet to be the Unicode order.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The script you linked to does not work that way. It <em>only</em> writes
    out glyphs, unaware of the associated Unicodes -- if any! As it happily outputs
    glyphs with no Unicode as well; it was written for exactly that purpose.\r\n\r\nTo
    get an output sorted on Unicode, you need to know which glyph in the font has
    which UC associated with it. Re-associating the glyphs with their Unicode code
    points is no easy task: it requires reading, parsing, and sorting the <code>cmap</code>
    entry in the original font file, all in Javascript."

  body: In FontLab, you can control the order when you're in the Font view (the main
    window, showing all the glyphs). Choose "Sort Glyphs > By Unicode" from the Glyph
    menu. You can also fine tune the order in the Index view of the Font window by
    dragging glyphs around.
