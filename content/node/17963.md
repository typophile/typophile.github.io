  body: 'again, very nice! i like how the stems bow in and get thinner in the middle,
    however it think you may have overdone it on the tall ascending characters: d,
    h & l (d & l in particular).'

  body: "Feel like a good companion. Keep an eye on the right legs of the m,n,h etc.
    They need to be at a steeper angle. Now they are opening up to much and breaking
    your diagonal flow. Also, the r will give you spacing problems. Too wide. Try
    working on the terminal.\r\n\r\nI might also lighten the whole italic a little.\r\n"

  body: "Beautiful lettershapes.  In the text setting, I notice\r\n- Apart from the
    r, the c and o seem significantly too wide.\r\n- n, m, h are indeed problematic.
    I do like the tension between the differently angled strokes, it would be great
    if you could make that work. I agree that increasing the the angle of the whole
    letter might be a good start\r\n- The u appears too upright.\r\n\r\nHope that
    helps!\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

  body: The real problem with the ascenders might be that the serif is too strong.
    Combined with the thin-middle strokes (which I like), they give me the feeling
    that the weight of the serif is about to bend the whole stroke to the left like
    a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.
