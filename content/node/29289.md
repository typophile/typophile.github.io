body: what are the necessities by law to have on a cd cover i.e should it have this
  or that on it whether you like it or not? and what if it is for a company and not
  a cd to sell but send to their clients. what then? what do you include on those
  kind of cd covers? the logo and website address of course and address? or no address?
  no barcode right because it's not being sold. am i right there? and i'm guessing
  no ISBN No or is there? do companies have to have them because i have seen them
  on company report cover sheets so i am confused now. please elaborate on this issue.
  thankyou.

  body: There are no laws regarding what does and does not go on a CD cover in the
    USA. In fact, unless the corporation has some specific policies regarding what
    must go on a cover (and many record companies don't) the designer can just not
    put anything extra on it, and anything else can be placed on the outer wrapper
    as a sticker. A great example is Prince's "black" album, which had nothing more
    than black paper inserts. Tool's last two album covers also went this route.

    was that it needed to say \"Made in Canada\" if it was being sold in the USA because
    the CD and packaging was, well, made in Canada. Since you say it's not being sold,
    go nuts with the design however you want.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n"

    (and recorded sound) CDs are treated differently, they use the ISRC system.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/isrc.html\r\n\r\nThere
    are copyright issues to consider with both even an in-company product. Barcodes
    can perform tasks other than carrying the ISBN, they might be used for stock control
    or searches.\r\n\r\nThere are some national variations in requirements.\r\n\r\nTim"

    wants the product sold in a bookstore it must have an ISBN.\r\n\r\nA friend of
    mine has a company that designs and sells reading lights and magnifiers. The bookstores
    never sold batteries, because of the lack of ISBN. So he packaged a line of batteries
    with an ISBN number on them and now he sells the batteries next to the lamps and
    magnifiers.\r\n\r\n"
