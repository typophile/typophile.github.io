  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling over Kabel for some time now, and yesterday I decided to jump in, and do my version of Kabel-isque font. It has no metric or proportional or direct design of Kabel, since I keep finding issues with the original. The fact is I really like the overall feel of Kabel, but when I take a closer look, it just throws me off.</p>
<p>So, I decided to make my own version:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5329.png]
This is medium weight, and there&rsquo;ll be five or six other weights.</p>
<p>It has pretty much the same feel as Kabel, but now I can live with the glyph design as well. This is less than two days' work, so be gentle, but what do you think? I already know that uc M and lc g need work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see your points, but in my opinion, I&rsquo;ve made a whole new and differet version of Kabel with different x-height, weight(s), and with quite a few totally different glyphs. As you can see here, the ITC and Adobe/Linotype versions are pretty different from each other, as well as my take is very different from them:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test1_3475.png]</p>
<p>Here is glyph &lsquo;a&rsquo; with my design, then ITC and then Adobe with same point size:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/testi2_5098.png]</p>
<p>I found ITC x-height way too tall, and Adobe too small, so determined mine to my liking. Also, glyphs &lsquo;n, &rsquo;m&rsquo;, &lsquo;h&rsquo; and &lsquo;u&rsquo; have sharp connection instead of smooth like in &lsquo;a&rsquo; above; and there are many more differences over the whole character set.
I&rsquo;ve gone through my sample books, and both Adobe and ITC have taken some liberties from the Koch original. I think the most honest to original fonts is Elsner + Flake versions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was a bit harsh in my initial comments. Yes I agree that 
ITC Kabel with its huge x-height is a parody of Koch&rsquo;s original. 
But the small x-height of Koch&rsquo;s type – meaning tall ascenders 
and descenders – made it very elegant.</p>
<p>The sharp rather then rounded connection of your a is a design feature
that could also be applied to b d p and q.</p>
<p>And what will this face be called?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes; the small x-height does make Kabel very elegant. I want my version to go in the middle area between these existing designs. And I like some of the seventies posters made with ITC Kabel with the heavier weights, so I think I&rsquo;m keeping the current x-height. (I might make a tall ascender/descender version as well…)</p>
<p>I did try out the sharp connections for b,d,p and q as well, but when I tried that on the &lsquo;b&rsquo;, I wanted to keep it in Bauhaus-style, so it looked somewhat wonky. Therefore round connections.</p>
<p>As for the name, I&rsquo;m undecided. Any suggestions? STF Kabel? Tabel?</p>

I do not think anyone uses the whole family for one work (not good English). Heavy weight is not usually used with light weight, and so on, so I want to make weights to work with one weight removed from between.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so much that one might use certain weights together (although people do) as it has to do with creating a family that has a visually consistent design from the lightest to boldest. A big part of the art of type design has to do with compensating for visual illusions like this. Making things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look<!-- raw HTML omitted --> consistent is more important than having them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be<!-- raw HTML omitted --> consistent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your design and your decision, but I think you should consider it.</p>

With Kabel/Kaapeli, it does – somewhat - but in no way it is a formula everybody should go with. I found it appropriate to use with my fonts, but it is hardly a bible to type design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Walter Tracy in his Letters of Credit has a very astute analysis of the problems in Kabel, particularly the lower case, and even suggestions for improvement. I think you&rsquo;d find it very interesting and maybe helpful.</p>
<p>I think you have some problems with widths. Your a to me is too narrow for the rest of the design, particularly the e. Tracy criticizes the original m as too narrow. Here you have also made the n h u narrow as well, which I think is going to cause problems for good rhythm in words. The usual view, as expressed in Tracy&rsquo;s discussion of spacing, is that the counters in the h and o need to be not so different in volume.</p>
<p>I think you are right that Kabel has a lot of merits, but also problems in the lower case. But I think you need to work on the end result having more even rhythm, if the revision is going to be successful.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say as I don&rsquo;t feel nearly as experienced as others on this forum, but I will comment that I notice the round lowercase letters seem to look bigger in comparison to the other lowercase letters as the font gets lighter. This seems to be a result of all of the letters except the round ones thinning in character width with the weight loss. The o&rsquo;s not too bad, but the p, q, d and b look huge. Perhaps bring the stems in closer and loose the full circle? I know that kinda ruins the integrity of the font style but it might help create a more consistent color across the light weights.</p>
<p>Nice work on this. I&rsquo;m amazed thinking of the amount of work that must go into this that you make look so easy with a few image posts on a forum.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, Ryan-</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments. And I also had an issue with Kabel; it is very recognisable font, but those few things just weren&rsquo;t right to my eye. That&rsquo;s why I made my version.</p>
<p>In my opinion the optical difference in height with light and heavy are of no concern; have you ever seen those weights been used next to each other? Basic rule with large families is to leave one weight in between for emphasis; so, for light, use medium as an highlight weight, and for book, use bold, and for medium use heavy.</p>
<p>That is why I&rsquo;ve decided not to change the ratios of x-height and des- and ascenders.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This is very nice looking indeed. But I have to agree on the x height thing, to my eyes, the two lighter weights now look slightly compressed. This might be a spacing thing, though. Perhaps everything will be fine if you give the thinner weights the space they deserve. Keep it up!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I did try that, but then I came back to user: many times different weights are used next to each other. Different x-height would make it difficult.

This is just a sample, but you see my point: x-height and as/descenders should be the same, when there&rsquo;s a chance they&rsquo;re used with each other. Adjusting the ratios would be difficult.</div>
