  are very similar, but yet off to some degree. I think because its a \"system\" font
  that it doesnt exist anywhere in a typical font format, and if not, then I was thinking
  surely there must be a new version made that emulates it? see picture (ignore circle)
  any help appreciated, thanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT_4992.jpg]"

  body: Frode, thanks for your suggestion. Yeah, there are a lot on DaFont that are
    close, but things are off, such as your suggestion has serifs which sorta throws
    it.
