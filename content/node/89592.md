  set, but there's no \"English Channel.\" http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet \r\n\r\nAny
  idea if this font exists, or what it might look like in order to offer an alternative?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    <em>La Manche 1960</em> would be more appropriate.\r\nPerhaps such a face would
    be somewhere between London and Paris\u2014interpolation?"

    which show it to you?\r\nOne possibility is that they had some pre/unreleased
    (or custom) version of Chalet.\r\n\r\nEdit: as Nick said, it looks like a version
    between Paris and London:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/?page=showfont&id=698\r\n\r\nYou
    will need to contact House Ind. about it."
