  character have a name... so I would be able to search for more info.\r\n\r\n(in
  case the attached image doesn't show up, it looks like an en dash touching the stem
  of a capitol D...  like: -D with tighter kerning)"

  body: This character comes up often for me - when I change fonts in InDesign. It
    seems to replace the x character that is used for dimensions, as in 8 x 10". Sometimes
    it replaces bullets. But I don't know its name.
