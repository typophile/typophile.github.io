  body: "We had this question recently, and I believe it was agreed that this was
    a custom blackletter, not available as a commercial font. In fact, it seemed that
    there were several different versions of this logo we have looked at -- all custom,
    i think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: i don't remember an agreement being made.  Additionally the variance in the
    font appearance is simply dictated by the process through which the signs were
    created. This sample is from a CATALOGUE, a PRINTed piece therefore a typeface
    must have been set and named. As well 200,000+ fonts ... right. Please someone
    else take a stab at this.

  body: "Bart, I don't think the fact that the catalog was printed means a typeface
    had to be used. There are any number of ways that hand-drawn lettering could be
    reproduced as part of a printed page. For example, a metal plate could be made
    and used for the printing. Do they ever use the same lettering for anything except
    the logo?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You also said this was from an \"old .. catalogue poster\". If 'old' is before
    the 1980's, the 200,000+ font statement doesn't apply. Digital fonts were only
    starting to be widely used by the mid-to-late '80's, and the number of fonts was
    not so large until relatively recently.\r\n\r\nI have looked at books I have on
    type, and so far I have not been able to match this blackletter style.\r\n\r\n
