  anybody ID this font, or something that looks extremely similar to it? it\u2019s
  like andale mono, but the corners seem a little more curved & i think the weight\u2019s
  different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni have a client who wants me to vectorize his tiny bitmap
  source, & he is no longer in touch with the original designer & has no larger source
  image.\r\n\r\n[i tried to ID it using whatthefont, but the source is too small to
  yield much in the way of accurate results.]"

    may see one that matches, but the letters are poor ones for making an ID. You
    can also search Dafont.com, if that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    font\".\r\nBy the way, it sure isn't a monospaced font like Andale Mono.\r\nYou
    could find something interesting here:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/humanist/fonts/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DSTUDIOS%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3D%26seed%3D23"

    though).\r\nCould be almost any modern sans. Do you happen to have more characters?\r\n\r\n[edit:]
    Late! What Riccardo said."

    characters, & no higher res.\r\n\r\nupon reflection, i feel like an idiot for
    suggesting andale mono. ugh. i was really tired that night.\r\n\r\n[& yeah, i
    meant bitmap as in all i have to work with is that tiny raster image. i don\u2019t
    know how you can get somebody to design a logo for you & not keep the source files...but,
    whatever.]\r\n\r\ni tried absara sans, a&s sign gothic, & adobe pi std to no avail.\r\n\r\nabsara
    sans is the closest i\u2019ve gotten so far, but the bottom & top of the D bulge
    too much, & the S still seems subtly off. the U & O is too wide too. any other
    ideas of fonts to try? i really want to avoid having to actually modify the letterforms\u2019s
    paths in illustrator...that could easily lead to a night of being compulsive that
    i...am not really in the mood for at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\ni\u2019m attaching
    a screenshot of my current situation in illustrator [absara sans tf medium regular,
    15 pt & stretched horizontally a little.]:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/N7STUDIOS_absara-sans-med-reg-15pt_6597.png]"
