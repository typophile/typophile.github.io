  Grotesque?\r\n\r\nI just don't dig the Grotesque numbers . . . they just never seem
  to jive. \r\n\r\n"

  body: for me, the fact that a lot of the glyphs in that font seems a bit off is
    the charm. would be hard to suggest something... maybe perhaps try pairing it
    with numbers that are even further away from it (depending on use) like something
    from hoeflers "numbers" font? something with a  lot of character to it? just an
    idea.

    body: "i agree that much of it is part of its charm and in certain instances it
      works for me, but i'd still like to find a numbers set that has the same \"heavy-handed\"
      charm.\r\n\r\nthanks for the suggestions!"

    be enough weights and widths in the new release to suit your needs.
