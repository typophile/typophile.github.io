body: " hello friends. I'd like some comments on an angular script logotype i'm working
  on as a personal project. I'm pretty inexperienced when it comes to drawing letters.
  My main concerns at this point are trying to get a nice even x-height across the
  lowercase letters and achieving bold, foward moving slant to the right and legibilty.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is another go at it. Ive removed the flourishes from the W and
  increased the height of the middle hump. comments?\r\n"

  body: "Reminiscent of two scripts discussed <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20332.html?1069226113\">here</a>.\r\nThe
    main difficulty I have with reading it is the shape of the bowl on the y and the
    baseline of the W which is making the o seem high and breaks the angle of the
    lowercase. The two flourishes on the W and y are also fighting the direction of
    the lowercase, perhaps if you applied the same angle on the flourishes that might
    resolve it.\r\nTim"

  body: You cannot in the new typophile. You have to add them to the top. I don't
    like it but it's the way it is for now. I am having trouble understanding how
    your type will work. Is the idea that you will type it & then Alter the baseline
    to be on an angle?

  body: "thats a shame about the image posting functionality.\r\n\r\nEbe, I am not
    designing a typeface. What you are seeing is the development of a script logotype.
    Is it unconventional to design a script on an angle? Should I, instead, design
    it on a horiztonal baseline and then skew the entire thing?"

    t a typeface \r\n\r\nOh! I thought it was a font that you could use to build a
    logo with....\r\n\r\nOkay that makes sense now.\r\n\r\nWhat is this for anyway?
    Can we have more context?"

  body: Russ, since you aren't designing a "typeface," I'm going to move this thread
    to the "logo" discussion area of the critique forum. Maybe you'll get more feedback
    there!
