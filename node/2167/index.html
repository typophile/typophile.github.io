		<div class="commentbody">James, a lot of graphic designers &#40;and all major design associations&#41; <i>do</i> frown on spec work. It devalues the work, invites amateurism, and opens the artist to all kinds of intellectual-property vulnerabilities. Design contests are often tolerated when run by nonprofit organizations, but that&#39;s about it. <BR> <BR>Good design involves more than just coming up with a neat idea. It requires research, investigation, and getting to know the client. If you want good design, hire professionals and pay them for their time and work. </div>

A &#39;good designer&#39; would be one well versed IN typography. I think you will find many talented &#39;typographers&#39; who could set a beautiful page for you, but would be clueless when it came to trying to develop and impliment an identity. If this makes sense. <BR> <BR>Ohh, and no, you will NOT find a &#39;good designer&#39; <BR>who will do spec work. &#40;period&#41; <BR>Maybe if you were a fortune 100 company. <BR> <BR>Spec work is for the art school kids. <BR> <BR>HIldebrant.</div>
