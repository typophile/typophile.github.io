  body: "From the Wikipedia: \r\n\r\n***\r\nThe word nerd gained currency from the
    1950s at a time when many school students did not see excelling at school as \"cool\".
    Therefore nerd originated as a derogatory word (although some people now consider
    it a compliment), while the term geek became widespread later (1980s) and has
    avoided many of the negative connotations. Geek as a milder version of nerd may
    also apply to socially insignificant people, while nerd refers more to socially
    inept people.\r\n\r\nPundits and observers dispute the relationship of the terms
    nerd and geek to one another. Some view the geek as a less technically skilled
    nerd. Some factions maintain that \"nerds\" have both technical skills and social
    competence, whereas geeks display technical skills while socially incompetent;
    others hold an exactly reversed view, with geek serving as the socially competent
    counterpart of the socially incompetent nerd, and call themselves geeks with pride.\r\n\r\nSome
    regional differences may exist in the use of the words nerd and geek. Some claim
    that on the North American west coast the population prefers the term geek to
    nerd, while the North American east coast prefers the word nerd to geek. Others
    on the east coast dispute this, claiming that they have always found nerd used
    disparagingly and geek used in a positive light. In Britain, this latter view
    tends to apply \u2014 nerd has more offensive connotations than geek, which speakers
    of British English often use affectionately. Compare anorak.\r\n***"

  body: "From the Wikipedia:\r\n\r\nA geek is a person who is fascinated, perhaps
    obsessively, by obscure or very specific areas of knowledge and imagination. Geek
    may not always have the same meaning as the term nerd (see nerd for a discussion
    of the disputed relation between the terms).\r\n\r\nThe definition of geek has
    changed considerably over the years. Below are some definitions of the word \"geek\",
    in order from newer to oldest. All are still in use.\r\n\r\nA person with an encyclopaedic
    knowledge of random trivia especially those bordering on the highly obscure. Trivia
    geeks are often also known as ubergeeks.\r\nA person who is interested in technology,
    especially computing and new media. Comparable with the classic definition of
    hacker. Late 20th century and early 21st century\r\nA person with a devotion to
    something in a way that places him or her outside the mainstream. This could be
    due to the intensity, depth, or subject of their interest. This definition is
    very broad, and allows for mathematics geeks, band geeks, computer geeks, politics
    geeks, geography geeks, geeks of the natural sciences, music geeks, history geeks,
    Good Eats geeks (Briners), linguistics geeks, sports geeks, figure skating geeks,
    SCA geeks, gaming geeks, typography geeks, ham radio geeks, public transit geeks
    (metrophiles), anime and manga geeks (otaku), Stargate geeks (Stargate SG-1/Atlantis
    fans, Gaters), Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel geeks, Star Wars geeks, Star
    Trek geeks (Trekkie), Tolkien or fantasy geeks (Tolkienite), geeks of many colours,
    genders, and styles, and last but not least, Wikipedia geeks. Late 20th Century
    and early 21st century\r\nG.E.E.K. as an acronym came from the United States Military.
    It stands for General Electrical Engineering Knowledge. It is unclear if this
    was the origin of the current meaning for geek, or if the acronym was used in
    a joking way toward the pre-established meaning for geek (a backronym).\r\nA person
    who swallows live animals, bugs, etc., as a form of entertainment at fairs etc.
    This often included biting the heads off of chickens. The Geek would usually perform
    in a \"geek pit.\" This probably comes from the Scottish geck, meaning 'fool',
    in turn from Low German. 19th century\r\n"
