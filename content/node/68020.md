body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been working with Cycles 11 for some time now, and I really
  like it, but there is something that bugs me. Whenever I type the \u20AC sign I
  get a /dyet/ sign (D with crossbar), which is a character in Serbo-Croatian (according
  to Bringhurst). There is a \u20AC sign in Cycles, which I now access through the
  Glyphs panel in Indesign. How can I change it so I get an \u20AC sign when I type
  it? (I'm using the Mac PS version)\r\n\r\nAnother small thing is the \xDF in Cycles
  Smallcaps. In german the \xDF isn't used in allcaps setting, but replaced with SS.
  However Cycles smallcaps does not include this character, replacing it with something
  else. Can I make a simular adjustment to my typeface to replace \xDF with SS? I
  noticed that when I set Cycles 11 in allcaps it does make the SS out of \xDF.\r\n\r\nI
  realise that for both of these questions I could use the search/replace function,
  but this has the disadvantage that when I would copy/paste texts from other programs
  or sources it would not show correctly, and if I decided to change typeface or case
  it would also need new adjustments. So another solution would be preffered.\r\n\r\nHelp
  is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nJeffrey"

  body: "There certainly is a way for you to make the changes on your own, but as
    you\u2019ve certainly licensed the typeface properly: Contact Sumner Stone before
    doing anything else. You want him to fix a bug, strictly speaking, and I think
    he is going to help you. That way, he avoids customers messing around with or,
    rather, in his fonts, and you can be sure that the problem is dealt with professionally.
    As far as my experience goes, most type designers are cooperative and quick when
    it comes to such issues.\r\n\r\nGive it a try and let us know if you got what
    you wanted."

  body: "Thank you,\r\n\r\nI have been in contact with Mr. Stone before, and he's
    always been very friendly. I will write him a mail. I just thought that this may
    be a more general question as well which people might have dealt with before.
    There might have been easy ways to solve this, which I am not aware of. Bringhurt
    talks about remapping the keyboard, so I figured this might be the way to fix
    these problems. I agree with you that it's very nice getting into contact with
    the type designer, it sort of adds a human dimension to a typeface. "

  body: "Jeffrey \u2014 Sumner will probably welcome the attention to what sounds
    like a bug and fix it for you. Or he may authorize you to do it yourself. Either
    way, you\u2019re covered and you\u2019ve done right by the designer.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like the Euro needs a proper Unicode encoding. The Small Caps doesn\u2019t have
    anything encoded for \xDF, so I\u2019m not sure what your software is inserting
    in its place.\r\n\r\nThese should be easy fixes, but always best done with the
    source files to regenerate sound fonts."

  body: "I just went & looked. In PS Cycles 11, \u20AC is in the \"currency\" symbol
    position. Characters in Postscript Type 1 fonts are identified by name. I don't
    know the key sequence for \"currency\" on a Mac. Unicode for \"currency\" is is
    00A4, perhaps your layout program would go & get it if you enter that Unicode.
    \r\n\r\nPostScript Type 1 fonts in OT-savvy programs do require some work. You'll
    just have to type two small-cap esses for the German double-s. There is often
    a significant amount of lying about character names in 8-bit fonts like PS-1.\r\n\r\nSumner
    has made OT versions of his fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stonetypefoundry.com/stonetypefoundry.html\r\n\r\nWhether
    or not he'll allow you to make up an OT version based on the glyphs in your PS-1
    font is up to him."

  body: "Thanks Charles & Kent,\r\n\r\nI contacted Sumner Stone and he ackowledged
    that these were bugs, which he would fix for an updated version. Unfortunately
    I bought Cycles at MyFonts where they didn't offer an OT version. But the opentype
    versions don't have real opentype functionalities (smallcaps and other options
    are still in seperate fonts), but it seems the euro issue is resolved, at least
    in my OT Arepo version. He also told that the euro sign could be typed with the
    currency symbol, although unfortunately I haven't been able to locate it until
    now...\r\n\r\nI won't go messing around with the font, as might break more than
    I would fix ;-)\r\nAnd I'll just hope that mr. Stone will think about me when
    he issues a new version...\r\n\r\nThanks again, Jeffrey"
