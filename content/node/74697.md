  a hobby basis but I'm in no way an expert. I'm about to make replicas of a swedish
  food packaging from the 80's and I need to identify the font... I've always gotten
  top qualifyed guesses from people in this forum and I'm wondering if anyone can
  help me out with this one?\r\n\r\nhttp://fredrikedin.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/blavitt.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nSandra"
