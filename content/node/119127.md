  body: "You can try to search for \"inline\" keyword but I doubt this is a font as
    it is - it looks like a custom monogram/logo.\r\nYou can use e.g. the /K of <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=ITC&ffam=ITC%20Avant%20Garde%20Gothic%20-%20Bold&fid=27a9fde28176d898c658b2aaf25d66a2&fstyle=b&fsize=60&text=K&fit=1|ITC
    Avant Garde Gothic (Bold)]]</strong> and add the inline effect manually to match
    your sample."

  body: If, by chance, it is a typeface, we'd have better luck finding it if you could
    provide an uncropped version of the image and the name of the person who uses
    it on their business cards (if the designer features the card design in their
    online portfolio, they may also mention the font or the fact that it is custom).

  body: "For a font with the straight portions of the inline check Core Circus 2d
    In [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoreCircus2dInInUse_3767.gif] https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-circus/
    Use as is or extend the inline to make the curved portions of the Kreisler _K_
    logo. The weight of Core Circus is a little lighter than the Kreisler _K_ logo.
    So if you are editing you could make the _K_ bolder. Or you could do all of the
    inline from scratch, using a base like ITC Avant Garde Gothic Bold, as suggested
    by Fivos.\r\nDon"
