  and took this photo, wanting to know what it meant. They can't remember where they
  took it. I speak enough German to know that it's not. I would have run it through
  a translator to figure it out, but with the ligatures I truly don't know how it's
  spelled.\r\n\r\nI figured someone here would be at least intrigued by it typographically.\r\n"

  body: I tend to associate this kind of lettering style with Spanish & Catalan traditon.
    But it doesn't mean it could occur elsewhere. So far I haven't seen it much in
    a French context although I am far from an authority on that.

    problem is that while I'm quite sure the word at the bottom left is Esansuo (or
    Esansou) neither word has substantial hits on google.  Ditto for some of the other
    words (presuming Spanish-like reading of the letters).  It could be another language

  body: "I looks romance based to me.  But google only finds the sequence esansou/esansov/esansvo/esansuo
    in a French-language book, but it appears to me to be a name.  I don't think it's
    basque, if the inscription is more than a few decades old it would have a pretty
    distinct style, and it just doesn't sound like it at all.\r\n\r\nThe last bit
    of the second line says \"M. Farbvs \xC3ey....\" Farbus is a French city near
    the German border.  Interesting observation about the quality, but wwouldn't you
    expect that to cause thinner lines?  It seems to get oddly thicker.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Some of this can be explained. But I will say I am surprised that writers
    here more widely-travelled than I, and who have much greater skill with languages
    than I have not written about this.\r\n\r\nFor years the only European consulate
    of the island(s) nation of San Serriffe was in Farbus, France. This came about
    because of a lamentable mis-communication between San Serriffe\u2019s then foreign
    minister, the then esteemed Sir Optima Gill, and the nation\u2019s secretary of
    administration, Ms Joanna Felicity Ludlow. The root of the problem lies in the
    convoluted roots of the language of San Serriffe. Several earlier posts came close
    to this. Serriffers speak a pidgin based on Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, and
    a touch of Basque. To this is added a mix of trade languages (often pidgins themselves)
    of island nations that have at one time or another been neighbors to San Serriffe.
    It has over centuries become a very difficult lingo to comprehend, with variants
    popping up from block to block, even in the capital city, Bodoni. Cognates seem
    to abound, but often they lead down blind alleys.\r\n\r\nIn most dialects of Serriffian,
    a long journey is known as a \u201Cfarbus.\u201D Thus, Minister Gill told Ms Ludlow
    that the soon to be established consulate was going to be a farbus from home.
    She misunderstood, and established the consul in that French town. This photo
    shows the fa\xE7ade of the San Serriffian consulate in Farbus. That\u2019s the
    easy part. From there I have worked many an hour to ferret out the rest of the
    text; to little avail.\r\n\r\nMuch of the difficulty comes from the odd feather-like
    features you see in the VoR and Vor ligatures. These are special features of the
    San Serriffian script. The exact linguistic function of these features has not
    yet come to light, but it is known that the general term for the feathered constructions
    is \u201CChelt.\u201D It is believed they serve to indicate extensions (\u201CArials\u201D),
    contractions (\u201CFedras\u201D), or even contradictions (\u201CGranjons\u201D)
    of the base word; they can modify its beginning, middle, or end. They seem to
    be based on petroglyphs found in ancient settlements of the indigenous Flong peoples.\r\n\r\nAlso
    note the other ligatures: Mo, VR, Vs, MoB, Ri, No, as well as the A overline and
    the elevated o. These forms are collectively known as \u201CHelvs.\u201D The variously
    shaped punctuation marks are collectively known as \u201CPoynters.\u201D They
    can also indicate elisions, in which case they are known as \u201CBinny,\u201D
    which can be used as \u201Cone binny\u201D or \u201Cmany binny.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo:
    to the inscription itself. \r\n**  The sequence \u201CMo.F. CV GATVoR\u201D is
    tough. I believe it refers to the only true hero of San Serriffe, navigator Macron
    Fore-edge, who claimed Barcelona and \u201Call lands attached thereto\u201D for
    his home country when he cast up on that city\u2019s shore in 1877. Formal Serriffian
    proclamations often start with a phrase something like \u201Cin the name of Macron
    the Navigator.\u201D\r\n**  FVRRIONVoR may refer to an establishment that shoes
    horses, but which is possibly better rendered as \u201Chouse of the outlanders\u201D\r\n**
    \ Guifa sees \u201CFARBUS\u201D in MoFARBVs\xC4EY. As far as I can tell, this
    means \u201CMacron has established in the City of Farbus.\u201D\r\n**  Hrant sees
    \u201CSAN.\u201D  In fact, the word ESANSVor (as best I can render it without
    a San Serriffian font) means \u201CEmbassy of San Serriffe.\u201D \r\n**  MoB.ARiNo[V?]
    is also a bit of a puzzle. Possibly it refers to the marines on guard at the consul,
    often referred to as \u201CMacron\u2019s Bairns.\u201D Or does it refer to the
    tiny nation of San Marino, which at one point dismissed San Serriffe\u2019s offer
    to establish a trade mission?\r\n\r\nThus, loosely: \r\n\u201CIn the name of Macron
    the Navigator / the house of the foreigners in Farbus / the Embassy of San Serriffe
    / beware of our marines\u201D\r\n\r\nI do have a good photo of the small plaque
    Hrant asks about. But I refuse to post it, due to its scandalous content, which
    I believe would make the recent flare-up in Georgia & South Ossetia look like
    a temperance picnic were it revealed to the world. Sorry; we cannot risk letting
    loose the imperialistic claims of San Serriffe.\r\n\r\nAs far as the varying thickness
    of the lines: given the rigorous oddities of the Serriffian script, it is most
    likely that a native speaker / signwriter was brought to Farbus with the diplomatic
    corps to letter the building. This lettering style seems to have been developed
    after the visit of the first Venetian sailors to the islands. The earliest known
    name of this style is \u201CGripho.\u201D All public lettering on the islands
    is done by an order of shirtless men known as \u201CDowners.\u201D No drinking
    is involved; these guys are deadly serious about their work.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m grateful
    to my friend Neue Wysiwyg, a native San Serriffian. He had sent me a different
    photo of this fa\xE7ade some years ago. Even he is not completely sure what it
    means.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of San Serriffe in the \u201Clarger\u201D world.
    I suggest a web search for those who wish to know more. But beware: there is a
    lot of utterly bogus info about this lovely little nation on the web.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"

  body: "There was indeed some Welsh settlement on San Serriffe, Charles. Late in
    1823, two groups of Welsh lead miners and their famiies left home to establish
    mines in southwest Wisconsin. They hoped eventually to establish a type foundry,
    with an agreement to cast some new-fangled faces recently introduced by the Calson
    foundry, ones that looked quite unusual. Evidence of their settlement remains
    today in the small village of New Diggings in Lafayette County, Wisconsin. http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=New+Diggings&state=WI\r\n\r\nBut
    the other boat took a wrong turn and the miners ended up in San Serriffe. Oddly
    enough, they indeed found lead deposits and established a short-lived mine. They
    had a hard time reading the letters from their American cousins, so they ended
    up calling their town New Dwiggins. Nothing remains of this settlement today except
    a headstone that seems to carry a woman's name: Electra.\r\n\r\npowers"
