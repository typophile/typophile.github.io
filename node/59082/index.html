I'm interested in how Aztec Culture have influenced Graphic Design. So far I know that Art Deco movement was influenced by Mesoamerican Art. Do you know other movements, designers, typographers or graphic artist that were influenced by Aztec culture?

		<div class="commentbody">Correction: the right name is Gabriel Martínez Meave. Maybe you are confusing him with Gabriel García Márquez, the well known Colombian writer. By the way, García Márquez has a Mexican son who happens to be a graphic designer and type designer, [[http://www.gonzalogarciabarcha.com/gallery.asp?gallery_id=3337|Gonzalo García Barcha]], but he’s more interested in colonial era. Gonzalo has Mexican Motifs, a dingbat font who includes some pre-hispanic icons, though.

About the question: I think the biggest Aztec influence in graphic design is in Mexican designers. Since nineteenth century, Mexican people has thought that Aztec past is the most authentic source for “mexicanity” (a desperate attempt for erasing the Spaniard, <em>conquistador</em> roots). Because of this, a lot of artists have identified themselves with Aztec world (Diego Rivera, Jesús de la Helguera, José Obregón, José Clemente Orozco…). A book about this: Enrique Florescano, <em>Imágenes de la patria</em>, Mexico, Taurus, 2006.

At little scale, the same is for Mexican graphic designers. It is not my specialty, but as far as I know, graphic designers outside Mexico are/were not much interested in Aztecs. But certainly you could write to Gabriel Martínez Meave: I am sure he can tell better than me. You can find his e-mail address at kimeratype.com.mx</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Srpatron,
polish graphic design, sculpture and architecture of 20's and 30's were strongly influenced by Aztec patterns. It was a time of searching some kind of national style as a Modern interpretation of "folklority". Designers used motivs taken from polish and ethnic minorities' (eg. Huculs) art, and blended them with mesoamerican details to get stronger feeling of antiquity or tribality.
This eclectic style, half avant-garde, half decorative, transformed before the ww2 into a government style.
The best example of the style's flavour is "Seasons", a painting by Zofia Stryjeńska:

		<div class="commentbody">There are many examples of "Aztec" (prehispanic is more accurate) aesthetic implementation on the "institutional" architecture, graphics and sculpture from the 30's to the 80's. A kind of exquisite brutalism was the signature style of the national identity. If you want a much more figurative example look at the Ciudad Universitaria original buildings like the Central Library or the Dean's Tower.

I think that the strongest influence lies on the people's taste. Take blackletter as an example, it is not prehispanic but it has this brutal and exquisite character which made it popular in México.

Also take a look into Gabriel's personal site http://www.meave.org/Site/intro.html

Paco Calderon, the cartoonist, who is also very talented has some strips representing the institutional style of architecture I talked about:

Really nice advises, I found more good examples in Gabriel’s personal site.
The wrestling pictogram which resembles the Nahui Ollin its very interesting case, it fits exactly with my work, I’m looking for works that take Aztec graphic representations as a starting point but then are transformed in something else…
