  it for them.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot"

  body: "Though based on a typeface, it was heavily customized.\r\n\r\nAntique Olive
    Compact Italic gets close to the general letterforms, save for the a and the customized
    r and i:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antique-olive/\r\n\r\nFilmotype Ford
    is a modern font that is also close to matching the letterforms, but it would
    have to be artificially italicized, and the same customization done to the r and
    i:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/ford/\r\n\r\nFutura Extra Black Italic
    is the best match for the a, but you have to shorten the ascender on the h and
    customize the r and i:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/\r\n\r\n(NOTE:
    Antique Olive dates from 1962, Futura from 1932. Filmotype Ford was designed in
    2011, but based on a font released in 1953)"

    this /r from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura+black|Futura Black]] and probably
    slant the whole thing.

    body: I've been looking around but this seems to be handmade. It has characteristics
      of the fonts you've described though. It's nice to find a hand lettered logo.
