  transformations, having recently gotten ahold of a copy of <em>Printed matter</em>.
  And probably again like many, many others, I'm wondering how he made them.\r\n\r\n<img

  />\r\n\r\nBy every account, Martens is a generous teacher and colleague, so I'm
  certain that he had a pedagogical purpose in mind when he answered evasively <a
  href=\"http://www.harmenliemburg.nl/2010/09/01/2135/\">an interviewer's question</a>
  about how he makes these:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMartens: A birth announcement for
  my grandson (2002, Zeno) seems to be a moment in my live that I start to work with
  icons. The desire had been there for some time. Every designer or student seems
  to rediscover the crude halftone at some point, but I\u2019ve always thought how
  nice it would be to create different shapes instead of dots. My father\u2019s typewriter
  always fascinated me. I\u2019d hit a button and the letter \u2018a\u2019 appears.
  But that \u2018a\u2019 might as well be a bird or another picture, something I\u2019ve
  developed with Roelof Mulder for Emigr\xE9 magazine ... Ten years later I had the
  opportunity to figure out how to reconstruct Zeno\u2019s portrait in a different
  way.\r\n\r\nHarmen Liemburg: Many people would like to know the secret ...\r\n\r\nMartens:
  Well, it\u2019s relatively simple, and I\u2019m sure others have discovered how
  to do it as well, but I\u2019m not going to tell you anyway! This assignment (2001,
  fa\xE7ade Cultureel Centrum) is about the perception of separate colours at close
  range and the mixing colours that one perceives at a distance. The fact that you
  can create a third colour out of two, is something that never ceases to excite me.
  It\u2019s nothing less than a miracle! The problem here was to translate this idea
  (that was developed in Photoshop) into prints on large glass panels. Screenprinting
  proved to be too expensive, but after a while I found a company that could print
  on transparent material. As they needed vector outlines, this caused a necessity
  to come up with a workable system to make that technical translation, which we finally
  did.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI've been thinking of doing images similar to these
  with glyphs from typefaces, and while I'm all about learning things the hard way,
  I could use a hint about what he's up to here. Martens supplies a few of these himself
  here, of course--not Photoshop, and 'relatively simple'. And I know that at least
  one version of these transformations--creating greyscale instead of color--doesn't
  take very long to do. In 2004, there was an exhibit of Martens's and Paul Elliman's
  work at Seoul University; Hans Gremmen and Min Choi worked out a way for visitors
  to the show to have an instant symbol-generated portrait taken of themselves:\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/martens_example001.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nI've
  thought about making these with vectorized halftones made from color-separation
  layers, or from ranges of different levels of greys in an image. But note that Martens
  seems to be using specific vectors in combination to create specific colors--he's
  not pulling them in at random, or it doesn't look that way. (The same goes for the
  Gremmen/Choi images.) And since I know he's not doing these by hand, I'm stumped
  for how he gets these in a way that doesn't take months to do.\r\n\r\nSo, if there's
  anyone out there who knows Martens's secret: I don't want to disrespect Martens's
  right to keep his methods to himself or undermine his goals in doing so here, but
  can you at least give me a start--software, approach, anything?"

    are elements repeated radially then combined with various masking/combining/cropping.
    Doesn't seem too top-secret. \r\n\r\nAs for taking them all and combining them
    into an image, there is software out there that does this. Google 'photo mosaic
    software' to find some options.\r\n"

  body: He probably built a huge library of stock shapes and then wrote an Indesign
    plugin that analyzes a photo, his shape library, and then combines them all into
    a color image. I had a design teacher who did this to create art out of concentric
    B&W circles.

  body: '"Incubator experiment 1" on youtube.com, shows that a few simple overlapping
    bilatrally symetrical shapes, circularly oriented,  when under the influence of
    interpolation, and animated, as in this example, can lead to 1,000s of still shapes
    of interesting design. I personally, find the still variety to be a bit boring
    and repetitive, but I can see how massing them into arrays and then printing them,
    could be interesting, to some.'
