body: I&#39;m doing a little customization on FF Info Text, and notice that the capital
  T is really off centre &#40;left baring &#43;25, right -15&#41;, all other symetrical
  characters are centered in their space except this one, FontShop explain &#39;that
  is how the font is set up.&#39; <BR>This looks like a flaw to me, but it is consistent
  throughout the family. I&#39;ve been mistaken before, so i&#39;m not at ease &#39;fixing&#39;
  it.

  body: 'Oh, I get it now, the kerning fixes the &#39;all caps&#39; settings and other
    spacing issues, though its still not a practice that I see the point of, unless
    it&#39;s to make the best of applications that don&#39;t support kerning. '

  body: Relying on the availability of kerning is a tricky business. <BR> <BR>The
    positive side of this is that people who have kerning off generally don&#39;t
    care about superb all-caps spacing anyway! And the &#34;T&#34; with the tight
    right side will &#34;house&#34; the lc better under it with no kerning. The negative
    is that you need a bunch of kerns to fix the funny spacing for sensitive users.
    <BR> <BR>In the end I don&#39;t think what they did is a good idea. But I agree
    it&#39;s safer to leave it as is, otherwise you&#39;d have to get a handle on
    their entire kerning scheme to adjust it, or redo the spacing yourself. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: thanks Hrant, <BR>are you aware of any other &#39;non kerning&#39; spacing
    operations?

    more attention for your problem there.

  body: Probably the biggest one is where round/round adjacencies &#40;like &#34;oo&#34;&#41;
    are made too tight. This is because straight/rounds and round/straights are more
    common linguistically, and making the round/rounds look right &#40;without kerning&#41;
    would make the &#40;more-frequent&#41; straight combos too loose. Kerns should
    then be used to loosen all the round/rounds. <BR> <BR>BTW, I remember you asking
    &#40;a while back - on the TD list?&#41; about the funny round/round spacing in
    some Berthold fonts, right? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
