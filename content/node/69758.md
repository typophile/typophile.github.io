  body: "Eric,\r\n\r\nI'm not certain what type face your using? But, you should consider
    using a type face designed for on-screen or digital use, maybe even an HTML font?
    Verdana or Trebuchet are both HTML fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm not a proof-read but I work
    with some and from my experience(s) with their comments, the dash you have here
    might be incorrect; and em dash is actually more appropriate(I think). Like I
    said, I'm not a proofer my self but your not using a dash here to alter the first
    word with the second. \r\n\r\nThis may not apply to your signature but I normally
    include more than one phone number and when I list phone numbers I either use
    periods in place of dashes or I use parenthesis for the area-code and a dash for
    the 7 digits.\r\n\r\nLastly, the second hyphen should probably be an em dash and
    the web address for Findlaw.com would probably be cleaner if you removed the www
    and cap'd the F. I personally add links to web addresses in my email client. Some
    email apps color the text #0000ff automatically, but that color isn't easy on
    the eyes. So decide for yourself if you want to add color? I find that color signals
    that the link is active and the most expected color is the default #0000ff but
    you can choose a link color of your own and just stick to it as well. What ever
    you wish?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signature_6160.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nHope
    this all helps.\r\n\r\nRuss"

    but I'd also cap the \"L\" to be consistent with the way they do it at the site.\r\nFindLaw.com"

  body: "<strong>@ Riccard0:</strong>\r\n\r\nGreat response. You are a wise man :)\r\n\r\nI
    agree that design in E-mail can often times make an E-mail look unprofessional.
    \"Good design is as little design as possible\" \u2014 Dieter Rams via Objectified:
    A Documentary Film by Gary Huswit\r\n\r\nMaybe I will just make all of my E-mails
    plain text. I don't I mind a professional designer showing some personality in
    an E-mail signature though.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@ Russ:</strong>\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Thank you for the feedback. The font that I used is Georgia which is a Web safe
    font. I use Verdana for body text so I wanted a different font for the signature.
    I might consider just making the signature Verdana.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Good call on
    the dash. I suppose I intended it more as a stylized bullet rather than a dash.
    Fail on my part, LOL. I think I will most likely change the dash to an actual
    bullet or a vertical bar.\r\n\r\n\u2022 As far as the numbers go I think I have
    both a local and toll free number so I should probably include both numbers. I
    am trying to provide the least amount of information necessary so I need to think
    more about whether or not I need to include both numbers. I am leaning towards
    yes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I think the formatting of the phone numbers is subjective.
    I do not like parenthesis for the area code and I am indifferent as far as periods
    versus dashes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I like your suggestion for the Web site formatting.
    I will get rid of \"www\" and I will camel case the Web site. <strong>@ JamesM:</strong>
    Good catch on capitalizing the \"L\". I do not like the standard blue link but
    I can chose a different color.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I do not mind the lack of color for
    the link since the underline shows the Web site is a link. I will consider adding
    color. Color can improve the emphasis that the Web site is a link.\r\n\r\n"
