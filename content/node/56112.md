  set for each stylistic alternate:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/crss/node/55586\r\n\r\nI
  recalled I had learned that because of Illustrator's OpenType panel's limitations
  (i.e. it's not easy to access 'sets') you could, if you were so inclined, group
  SS01 with aalt and salt, and group SS02 with calt\u2026 although this was highly
  debated\u2026\r\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to bring this up is that I'm about to complete
  a font that will have up to five or more 'sets', (where previously I've only used
  up to two SS01 & SS02) and obviously there's not enough other feature definitions
  (or buttons on the Illustrator Glyph panel) to make it easy to activate these sets\u2026\r\n\r\nHow
  would you recommend moving forward, I like the idea of breaking the rules for usability,
  but I also like being consistent with how I do things\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat is the best
  way to implement multiple 'sets', yet still utilize aalt, salt, and possibly calt,
  and additionally titl, and why doesn't Adobe sync the OpenType panels interface
  between all of their apps? (Let alone all software brands)\r\n\r\nMike"

    think anyone was recommending using <code>calt</code> as an alternative place
    to put a stylistic set. <code>calt</code> is supposed to be \"on\" by default,
    except it isn't in Illustrator. I definitely wouldn't do that. Illustrator does
    not allow you to apply a stylistic set to a range of text as some other apps do,
    but you can view the sets individually in the Glyph palette."

    breaking the 'rules'\u2026\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to understand is, if
    you have multiple stylistic sets, then what do you use aalt for? Is aalt in theory
    just SS00 really?\r\n\r\nAnd I'm just trying to understand the Illustrator disconnect
    with accessing sets and why it is different than other programs.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "<code>aalt</code> just specifies any and all alternates, including anything
    covered by other features. There is no specific user interface item to apply <code>aalt</code>,
    but it does affect what you see in the Glyph palette, specifically those little
    arrows that indicate alternate forms for a glyph and what appears under the little
    pop-up on the arrows. \r\n\r\n<code>salt</code> at first seems similar to a stylistic
    set, except that it is intended to be applied to individual characters and can
    include more than one glyph alternate. However, the user interface for this feature
    is inconsistent: In Illustrator there is a single on/off button, with the result
    that you can only access the first available alternate (you can get at the rest
    via the glyph palette). InDesign doesn't have any obvious support for <code>salt</code>,
    at least in its OT submenu, but you see them listed under Stylistic Alternates
    in the glyph palette."

    final question.\r\n\r\nConsidering the inconsistencies in application support/interface,
    and the fact that the future of application support/interface is unknown, what
    would be the best scenario for myself (and others), considering I always include
    some type of alternates (and it looks as though in the future I will include multiple
    stylistic 'sets' (as well as ligatures, basic fractions, and case features)\u2026
    What would be the best way to move forward and set up my features, specifically
    with regards to stylistic sets and alternates?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help with
    this!"

  body: I would recommend following the spec as best you can and hope that application
    support will improve. If you go your own way, you run the risk of confusing users,
    particularly when they switch between your font and one that follows the spec.
    There are definitely areas of ambiguity and disagreements among font developers
    with regard to such things. In the end, the needs, convenience and expectations
    of the font user should have the highest priority.

    many GUI levels to access the style, and you can spell out what the feature is
    in the font name.\r\nThat way you also get to find out what people really want.\r\nAnd
    you can realistically lower the per-font cost in a family package.\r\n\r\n"

    put alternate glyphs into separate fonts, there's no way to automatically kern
    between them, or allow them to interact with things like contextual alternates.
    \r\n\r\nWhat would be really cool is if various OT features like stylistic sets,
    swash, titling, etc. would show up as virtual fonts in the font menu, sorted under
    family name like other weights and styles."

  body: "For example, I currently ship Mostra (not available yet in OT format) as
    three separate fonts--Mostra One, Mostra Two, Mostra Three. Conceptually, it's
    one typeface, but in order to accommodate the stylistic variants in the basic
    Type 1 and TrueType formats (without hijacking character slots meant for math
    characters or symbols, for example), I had to split them into three fonts. However,
    the way I split them up may not be the way a user would split them up. Ideally,
    you should be able to combine the different variations in any way you like. If
    you want to use Mostra Three, but would rather have the \"S\" from Mostra Two,
    you can simply select the \"S\" and choose Mostra Two, but you may need to do
    some manual kerning, depending on what characters are on either side of it (from
    Mostra Three).\r\n\r\nWhen I do the OT version of Mostra (which is long overdue),
    there will just be one font, with Mostra Two and Three represented by stylistic
    sets, but also in the stylistic alternates feature. The \"S\" from Mostra Two
    will be kerned against glyphs from Mostra One and Mostra Three that are not present
    in Mostra Two.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this isn't necessarily anything to do with
    stylistic sets. It's a problem with any sort of alternate glyphs if they are split
    out into separate fonts."

  body: "<em>Incidentally, this isn\u2019t necessarily anything to do with stylistic
    sets. </em>\r\n\r\nRight. So the question is, if there are three sets of alternate
    glyphs, what is the best way to configure them in fonts, to facilitate a typographer
    who may wish to mix and match?\r\n\r\nI've done some setting along those lines,
    with the three Eunoias, which are conceptually similar to the way the Mostras
    are set up.\r\nI found the best way to work is to set the word three times in
    the three different fonts, then cut and paste into a fourth mixed version. And
    then manually kern.\r\n\r\nI certainly think that cutting and pasting is better
    than selecting a character and applying a stylistic set or font, because with
    \"select and apply\", you're not so sure what the character is going to look like--whereas
    with cut and paste, you can see exactly what you're substituting, at the same
    size. It's better than working from a glyph palette, with small images. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
