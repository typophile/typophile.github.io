body: 'I recently designed a logo for the choir sing in. It''s a Baroque choir, performing
  Baroque and classical pieces. A little background: The mark is based on a characteristic
  of Baroque music being a repetition of melodic themes. I used this idea of repetition
  by mirroring 2 shapes to form an /A/ and /M/ for Arte Musica (did I mention it''s
  a mostly Italian choir). The four repeated dots represent the 4 voices soprano,
  alto, tenor, base. I wanted the over all form language to evoke musical notation.
  I think it might need some tweaks but I thought I''d put it out there. Any constructive
  feedback is welcomed.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artemusica_3990.jpg]'

  body: "I like it. \r\n\r\nMy only thought is that the name Artemusica is very small
    in relation to the symbol, and this might be a problem when the logo is reproduced
    in a very small size. I'd suggest reducing the logo to a tiny size and making
    a print on your printer and see how well it holds up."

  body: "Very nice.\r\n\r\nSome quibbles:\r\n- The two ball terminal styles are clashing.
    In context I myself prefer the style of the thin ones.\r\n- To me \"ARTEMUSICA\"
    is a bit disappointing; and not centered.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi hrant, thanks for the feedback. Would you mind elaborating a bit on the
    artemusica disappointment part?\r\nI wanted to keep it minimal with clean geometric
    sans serif but if you could explain what you're thinking it would great.\r\n\r\nI
    knew it needed some tweaking, working on the terminals is a good call.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Nice, though it looks a bit unbalanced to me. The dots don't quite line up
    vertically, the thin arms overshoot the horizontals just a bit too much, and the
    whole thing seems skewed slightly to the right. (Though I guess the last point
    could be intentional.)

  body: "I love the font. But to me there is also an unbalance.\r\nI am curious how
    it all looks without the highlight and background.\r\nThose are fine tools for
    presentation, but I'd prefer a clean look to judge. "
