body: Looking for sans recommendations. I like the friendliness of Neutra. Love the
  Los Angeles magazine font (name?). Or the one Vanity Fair uses in rubrics and elsewhere
  (again, name?). My favorite pick so far with a similar vibe is Verlag. Which fonts
  am I overlooking?

  body: "Geometric 415 is Metro by another name. I think a lot of these fonts are
    inspired by it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/\r\n\r\nIt
    lacks the double story 'a' of Verlag, tho.\r\n\r\nHere's Nobel - it was my longstanding
    crush but I think it's been replaced by Verlag.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel"

  body: "There is nothing like Neutraface. :^P I wouldn't call it friendly, but I
    would call it austere.\r\n\r\nVanity Fair is using something by our own lovable
    James Montalbano.\r\n\r\nVerlag is incredibly different from Neutraface. \r\n\r\nWhat's
    the project? Who's the market?"

  body: "Hi Mindy. There was this post recently about Neutra; http://typophile.com/node/21343\r\n\r\nPaul's
    already mentioned Proxima Sans, but in context of 'a lookalike to Neutra' I would
    recommend <a/href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html#\">Mostra</a>
    by the very same, very talented Mark Simonsen.\r\n\r\nThere is also the lovely
    <a/href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html\">Gotham</a> by
    Mssrs Hoefler and Frere Jones."
