  means \"brighter\" in the german language. Therefore i want to use a abstract \"SUN\".\r\n\r\nThe
  letters are constructed. But something is wrong- especially with the \"e\" `s\r\n\r\nI
  cant figure it out.\r\n\r\nPlease check.\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nmarshimaro \"heller\"\r\n\r\n\"According
  to your tips i changes some thing\" Please check. thanks"

  body: I think "l" should be thicker. I think the radius of the corners is too large.
    The left side of the "e" looks too thick. The counters in the "e" look too small.

  body: "I completely agree with SuperUltraFabulous that the sun graphic should be
    larger. Right now it looks like an asterisk, which (at least in America, I don't
    know about elsewhere) means that there's a footnote attached, which may not be
    the best message you want to send with your logo.\r\n\r\nAs far as the type goes,
    I would recommend that you use a typeface that already exists instead of trying
    to create your own. There are fonts out there made by designers taking into account
    minute details that you or I would never even catch. It'd be easier but more importantly
    you'd definitely end up with a better and more professional looking logo."

      design. \r\n\r\nas far as ahellerax goes i should stop doing that and looking
      for a already fixed one.\r\n\r\nDoes any of you may know some fonttypes which
      are similar to my more or less desired appearance. ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

  body: "I actually like your constructed \"font\". A couple of questions though:\r\n\r\n1.
    Why is the second 'e' different from the first? The counter is much bigger in
    the second one, and I think it looks better. I agree that the horizontals (especially
    the bottom one) should be slightly thinner in the 'e'.\r\n\r\n2. What type of
    company is this? When I look at it, I think of power tools. Do you make cordless
    drills? If so keep the logo. Do you make fancy pastries? If so, dump the logo.\r\n\r\nThe
    size of the star/sun/asterix actually works for me. Try placing it in different
    positions (such as before \"Heller\", as the counter of the 'e's, &c.) and see
    what happens. I also like the rounded 'r' better than the one with the 90 degree
    corner.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

      I corrected the horizontals as well as the \"l\"`s. \r\n\r\nthe company is a

  body: "I think the problem with your e's are that they are slightly too short, in
    the way that in a more conventional typeface the rounded characters are slightly
    taller than the squarer characters to visually compensate for their shape so that
    in a line of type they appear to be of the same height. Try slightly increasing
    the height of the e's (or reducing the height of the r and the lower part of the
    h) until they appear to be of equal height. I like the shape and position of the
    sun/cog/asterix (partly <em>because</em> it is ambiguous and has that missing
    footnote feeling), although you might have to enlarge it or reduce its points
    for some uses.\r\nTim\r\n\r\nYou need Flash to upload an image into a reply there

    will improve the kerning of the logo as well.\r\n\r\nTim"
