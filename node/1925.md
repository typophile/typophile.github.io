  body: I would say that this is probably a Didot and not Bodoni, due to the severity
    of the serifs. Most Bodoni&#39;s worth using are not totally unbracketed.  <BR>
    <BR>I can add that it is not Linotype&#39;s Didot. Nor is it ITC Bodoni or Hoefler&#39;s
    Didot. And obviously it isn&#39;t the incredibly ugly Firmin Didot from what was
    once Font Company &#40;that k is awful!&#41;

  body: It could be an older display version of Bodoni. It looks more like Bodoni
    than Didot to me, anyway.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> That IBM Bodoni is the closest. I just dug through myfonts
    and it is the closest. But, if that t does have a truly flat backside, and that
    k does connect, even that isn&#39;t a match. But, who cares, it is super close.
    <BR> <BR>Who did this logo originally? That might tell us something too.

  body: I was concerned about those two things as well, but since the sample is so
    rough, it&#39;s possible that the k connection and the t curve simply filled in
    in the sample. Hope springs eternal.
