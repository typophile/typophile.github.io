  do it all day every day. In your case we would look at a \"mirror\". What we do
  is tell you what we think of ourselves, and make sure you think that's what's wrong.
  What could be more exciting? Taught by beautiful people. What are you waiting for?\r\n\r\nIT

  who have gone through our training. Smiling.\r\n\r\nIT HAS TO BE EWE\u2122\r\n\r\nYour
