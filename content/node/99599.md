  to test how my font is looking. Please take a look at the attached PDF and critique,
  offer advice, prise or whatever you feel like doing. I believe the spacing and kerning
  is going ok, and another pair of eyes could help a lot.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPS.
  Please keep in mind that the typeface is not intended for reading long texts, so
  read it big and rest after a while )"

    That seems like something to fix first. '

  body: Yes eliason, that's something I'm aware of. Nevertheless, I was told that
    optical corrections should be done keeping in mind the final use that the font
    will have. As my typeface is intended for big point sizes, I'm not sure how much
    correction should I make as every point I move to make the "w" whiter means that
    its shape changes noticeably  when viewed at a "normal" size.

    information about fixing that?

    that the smaller the target size the more modulation you have to do, but the forms
    you have need <em>some</em> modulation for <em>any</em> size.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>where
    can I find information about fixing that?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHere's one thing
    you can try:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\r\nUse a big Aperture
    and a low Multiplier.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- Try moving up the tittles (dots of \"i\"/\"j\")
    to sit right above the top of the \"t\".\r\n- I think the \"6\" and \"9\" would
    benefit from having a gap like some of your lc letters.\r\n- You still need a
    lot of kerning.\r\n- Your blank space could be a hair narrower.\r\n- The parentheses
    are sitting too high, and the en-dash too low.\r\n- The comma is out of character.\r\n\r\nAnd
    can we see a charset?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      can try:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\r\nUse a big Aperture
      and a low Multiplier.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI will try again using the flower
      trap method and I will post my result. Anyways, I don't know how far I can and
      should go.\r\n\r\n<blockquote> - Try moving up the tittles (dots of \"i\"/\"j\")
      to sit right above the top of the \"t\".</blockquote>\r\nYes, I have considered
      that. There still is a lot of aligning to do... diacritics, punctuation marks
      and so on.\r\n\r\n<blockquote> - I think the \"6\" and \"9\" would benefit from
      having a gap like some of your lc letters.</blockquote> Good suggestion. I even
      think that more characters would benefit from that little gap, giving more consistency
      to the design.\r\n<blockquote> - You still need a lot of kerning.</blockquote>
      I know I know, and I haven't grasped the class kerning thing yet, so I'm manually
      kerning pairs... a pain in the a$$.\r\n<blockquote> - Your blank space could
      be a hair narrower.</blockquote>\r\nWhat do you mean by \"blank space\"? The
      advance width? the width of the \"space\" character perhaps?\r\n<blockquote>
      - The parentheses are sitting too high, and the en-dash too low.</blockquote>\r\nI
      designed the parenthesis to sit right on the baseline. In fact, the vertical
      stem goes straight from baseline to cap height, and then the curve protrudes
      from each end. The parenthesis is center-aligned to the characters inside...
      is this a wrong decision?\r\n\r\nWhat is the usual alignment height of the n-dash?\r\n<blockquote>
      - The comma is out of character.</blockquote>\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n<blockquote>And
      can we see a charset</blockquote>\r\nI'm gonna try finishing some glyphs I have
      left and post a charset. Do you know any way of generating a charset in Indesign?
      I don't wanna type 400+ glyphs!"

    are people too.  :-)\r\nBut you can have contextual alt parentheses that sit high

    think we had a thread about this recently; I myself put it at the same height
    as the hyphen - which you actually have at a good height.\r\n\r\nThe comma: I
    meant it looks like it's from another font. In contrast, look at your nice straight

    above, and somewhat above the descenders below.\r\n\r\nThanks for the charset.
    Looking only at the main alphanumerics, I'd say: the \"f\" is too shy, and out
    of character; the \"Q\" is really strange; and the \"2\" shouldn't have that curl
    at the bottom-right.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
