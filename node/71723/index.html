<p>I have edited the initial post a few times today, but I always got a server error. I wonder, why you just reply today. Was this thread somewhere on the top of the list of the recent threads, before you have replied?</p>
<p>@ moderators</p>
<p>Before Chris has replied, this thread was not in my track list anymore. Why? And why do I get the following message, when I reload this page, after I get the server error (error #500, as far as I remember):</p>

<p>Yes, it is error 500:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Arno &ndash; every time you&rsquo;ve updated this thread lately, the new AntiSpam module keeps flagging it as spam. It&rsquo;s happened three times so far today.</p>
<p>Each time it gets flagged as spam, the node gets unpublished and held for moderation. That&rsquo;s why it disappears from your tracking list and you get a server error.</p>
<p>I keep submitting it as a false positive, and hopefully the algorithm will someday learn to stop flagging it.</p>
<p>Until then, you&rsquo;ll just have to be patient. Florian, me, and the others can&rsquo;t keep tabs on things 24/7.</p>

<p>@ Kent</p>
<p>If a member tries to spam the forum, it is banned, correct? And if a member was not banned, this means, that the member wrote something, that is related to the forum. So the new spam software should only queue those suspicious posts, that were written by new members, that had not post anything, that was forum related in a certain time period, three days for example.</p>
<p>Except from that I have edited my account a few times yesterday (the additional information). Whenever I have done this, I had to fill in all fields again, because all fields were empty.</p>
<p>By the way the link “View recent blog entries” should be moved next to “View | Edit | Track” in my opinion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, the AntiSpam is still not acting perfectly. I’m in conversation with Jared about trying to find ways to improve it’s behavior without having to ditch it altogether.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jared just turned off the AntiSpam for general forum contents, but left it on for Blog posts — at my request, since that’s where we get the most spam. And that’s right when you decided to move your container to your blog (which is what I was going to suggest anyway), so it got caught again.</p>
<p>It should be live now. The AntiSpam thinks that the kind of updates you keep adding are suspicious.</p>
<p>We’re looking into a plug-in that would allow white-listing, so we can get past false positives for long-standing members. Please be patient.</p>
<p><cite> &gt; By the way the link “View recent blog entries” should be moved next to “View | Edit | Track” in my opinion.</cite></p>
<p>I don’t manage the site structure or features, I only act as a volunteer janitor. Perhaps someone at Punchcut will see this comment. Or you might submit the suggestion via the Bug Reports and Feature Requests forum.</p>
<p><cite> &gt; Except from that I have edited my account a few times yesterday (the additional information). Whenever I have done this, I had to fill in all fields again, because all fields were empty.</cite></p>
<p>I’ve asked for this bug to be fixed several times, because everytime I have to clean up SEO links in spammer accounts, I face this problem. So believe me, it’s 100x worse for us admins than it is for users.</p>

<p>You might refrain from constantly updating the main post in your Attachment and Bookmark Container blog node. Each time you do, it keeps winding up unpublished and back in the moderation queue.</p>
<p>There’s nothing I can do to stop that from happening right now. And I can’t spend all Sunday watching the queue in order to keep putting your blog back online.</p>
<p>Instead, you should consider adding any updates as comments in that blog thread instead, since those will now slip by unfiltered and not take the whole thread offline each time.</p>

<p>Uups. I will wait, until the bugs are fixed. I want to have bookmarks and attachments in the same box with the help of the list tags. I dislike the new feature, because I neither can group the links nor I can name the links nor I can mark anything else than the initial post of a thread, but at least in case of one of my links it shows to a specific post, at which the thread began to interest me.</p>
