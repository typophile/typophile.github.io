body: Greetings, <BR> <BR>   Our logo was designed by a web designer who is overseas
  and unavailable.  We have tried whatthefont.com and other font identification services,
  but have been unable to find a match.  We aren&#39;t sure whether he used an existing
  font or photoshopped the letters of another font to create our logo. <BR> <BR>   We
  would like to use this font within our company to tie our products with the company.
  <BR> <BR> <BR>   Thanks in advance, <BR> <BR>Steve Tarter <BR>ZedaSoft, Inc &#40;<a

    the other characters <BR>are very characteristic of FB Agency.

  body: I disagree about Agency, because it uses a monotone stroke. This typeface
    is unevenly weighted. It might be worth trying to match the S first, because the
    A might be a fabrication, like an inverted U. &#40;I was originally trying to
    help Steve separately, and recommended that he try this board, because the best
    I could come up with was using letters from Red Rooster&#39;s <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=RR00005103P2"
    target="_blank">Europa Grotesque</a>, and of course slanting them.&#41; I know
    how font multilations offend Yves, but I couldn&#39;t find anything closer. I
    thought maybe one of you would be more up on the Tech-ish fonts.

  body: though if you were to take agency  and stretch the crap out of it, the stroke
    proportions change. See example. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20035.gif"

  body: 'That goes a long way to make your point. And I guess if you did it with Agency
    Condensed, the relative thickness of the vertical strokes would get even more
    pronounced.  And I see that there is an alternate A that looks more like the original.
    I think I am agreeing with you now. Did you use Regular or Bold weight, and Normal
    width? '

  body: Here&#39;s the comparison with Raleigh Gothic Condensed Medium with the S
    outline tweaked &#40;the strokes weren&#39;t long enough in its original form&#41;.
    The &#39;lower case&#39; letters were a smaller size and then made 90% height
    to make the relative proportions closer. All the letters are 300% width. The bottom
    image is my simulation with Raleigh Condensed. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20044.gif"

  body: After looking at the one Karl did with Agency, I think that might actually
    be a better approximation, if he would use the alternate A, since he didn&#39;t
    need to alter the S. The letter corners look better in the Agency version, I think.
    <BR> <BR>What does Steve think?

  body: Mike, now you know why I hate the fact you can condense and expand letterforms.
    They loose the designers original intention, putting stress on vertical and horizontal
    strokes that make the type designers here cringe. It looks that you have a good
    solution, I bet the example was scanned softly or it was a scan of a printed piece.
    A couple of generations from the original. Dan

  body: Wow.  I&#39;m bowled over.  I can&#39;t thank you guys enough for helping
    us with this. <BR> <BR>We are now discussing whether it would be easier to switch
    our logo to one of these &#34;close&#34; fonts, or look for someone to create
    our font by modifying Agency or one of the others. <BR> <BR>The web developer
    that created the logo was known for creating button images using MicroSoft Paint
    and filling them out a pixel at a time.  If I didn&#39;t see that, I wouldn&#39;t
    have believed it.  I do remember him looking through some fonts while creating
    the logo, so I was hopeful that it wasn&#39;t a mix or a free-hand effort. <BR>
    <BR>The head hauncho is travelling today, so we can&#39;t come to a final decision
    today.  I think he&#39;ll be pretty happy with the progress you all have helped
    us make. <BR> <BR>Again, thank you all, and I&#39;ll be back in touch after the
    weekend. <BR> <BR> <BR>Steve

  body: Steve, I have an idea, reinvent your marketing postition, make it fresh and
    new and use an indie font, the way it was designed or have a type designer create
    a CI for you. Remember the saying when one door closes another opens, use this
    to your advantage. Dan

  body: Dan, what you say is true, but the designer&#39;s original intention is not
    the end user&#39;s main concern. A graphics program gives anyone the means to
    build from a font in almost any way their job requires. Do you think the folks
    at Google worried if Gustav Jaeger was going to be bothered by his &#39;Catull&#39;
    becoming three dimensional with highlights when they used it for their logo?  Sometimes
    such &#39;massaging&#39; improves the original work, whose letterforms or kerning
    pairs were not well planned.  Sometimes it just helps you to fit the space you
    have, but isn&#39;t that within the user&#39;s license?  You can say the end result
    is ugly, but that is the risk the tamperer takes. What if it&#39;s better?   <BR>
    <BR>For what it&#39;s worth I sympathize with the idea that fonts should be used
    as designed. I play with them when someone wants to match a font I can&#39;t find,
    or that was a custom design no one has any more. I play with them when a customer
    says &#39;can&#39;t you fix that &#39;t&#39;?&#39;

  body: Mike, I feel that there is a huge amount of lazieness. Its so easy to mash
    or bash a type style, why bother do, like you are doing, catalog and create a
    library of type designs that can be accessed. Its like the quote I used on the
    T-shirt contest &#34;I haven&#39;t heard from him last year, and I haven&#39;t
    heard from him from him this year and if I don&#39;t hear from him next year,
    I&#39;m going to write him a letter&#34;. The point being people won&#39;t spend
    the time for good design when they can do it quickly. So sad, Dan
