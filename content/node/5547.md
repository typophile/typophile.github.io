body: Well, it worked for FontDiner, so I thought I&#39;d give it a try. <BR> <BR>An
  american client has insisted that we use Dan Zadorozny&#39;s &#34;Gunship&#34; typeface
  in a project. I&#39;ve tried emailing him twice to buy a commercial license from
  the email address at <a href="http://www.iconian.com" target="_blank">www.iconian.com</a>,
  but with no luck. After over two weeks waiting, I&#39;m at a loss. <BR> <BR>Does
  anyone have any ideas if he&#39;s still around and could pass on a message, or who
  might be able to point him here?
