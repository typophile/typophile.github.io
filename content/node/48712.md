  blocks that is driving me crazy. What is this type effect called? Is it just considered
  a kind of drop shadow? Also is there a quick way to make it in Photoshop?\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flow_logo_large_6407.png]"

    19th Century British signwriting book of mine calls any effects to give the letters
    an appearance of thickness \"raising\". Shadow effects are \"shading\". I don't
    know about a special name for this look where the original letter face is removed.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure about Photoshop but in Illustrator I would use the Extrude & Bevel effect.
    Expand that to be flat paths & then use Pathfinder to knock out the original letters."

    with no problem. You can then expand the effect and edit the colours as you wish
    OR you can define on the extrude options a pure hard shadow.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nwww.nunocoelho.com"

  body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nSo after playing around with the Extrude & Bevel in Illustrator
    CS3 I don't believe this is what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nExtrude has two problems
    that I ran into:\r\n\r\n1) it seems to only be able to give you a 3D effect (Freeza
    is probably explaining a solution to this when he says \"define on the extrude
    options a pure hard shadow\" but I wasn't able to do this. I could remove the
    shading but I could not change the color of the extruded portion)\r\n\r\n2) it
    shifts the access of the type. in the picture \"FLOW\" is completely unaffected,
    but with Extrude I could never create a 45 degree angle shadow effect without
    rotating the type some amount.\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm not understanding you're instructions.\r\n\r\nI
    see this effect absolutely everywhere so it seems like it must be easy to do (I
    even saw it on an add on typophile just the other day). Anybody have any other
    hints?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nSven"

  body: "I am more of a Photoshop user than Illustrator, so that's the method I wound
    up sussing out for this. It's a very easy process that only takes a minute, although
    it doesn't nail what you want 100%.\r\n\r\nBasically, you just make a type layer,
    with the color of the text the same as the color of the background. Then click
    the \"Add a Layer Style\" button on that layer (the little fx button), and select
    Drop Shadow. Set the angle to be the drop you want (around 45 deg.), set Opacity
    to 100%, bring the Spread up to 100%, make the size what you want it at (I used
    7px), and then change the distance so that all of the shadow is on the bottom-left
    of the image (it will tend to peek out of the other edges because of the larger
    Size) - I went with 11px for this example.\r\n\r\nThis method does seem to create
    some roundness in the drop, unfortunately. It seems like it would be a matter
    of a few minutes to just manually straighten those edges, so long as this is just
    for a logo or two. But I suspect there might be a 3rd-party drop-shadow plugin
    that allows for that roundness to go away. I'll keep playing.\r\n\r\nOne love.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/svenSample_5740.png]"

  body: "Here's a way to achieve the effect in Illustrator (somewhat complicated,
    but works pretty well and the result is scalable without quality issues):\r\n\r\n1.
    Select the text (or object), copy it (CMD+C), lock the original object (CMD+2),
    paste a copy behind the locked object (CMD+B) and make it black\r\n\r\n2. ALT+Drag
    the pasted object away (in your case that would be down to the left), copying
    it\r\n\r\n3. Select both copies of the original objects, give them  and choose
    from the top menu Object > Blend > Make (CMD+ALT+B)\r\n\r\n4. From the same palette,
    choose 'Blend options...'. A new options palette will appear; select the 'Specified
    distance' option instead of the preset 'Specified steps'. Lower the distance until
    the individual blend steps aren't recognizable as such anymore.\r\n\r\n5. Unlock
    the original object (CMD+ALT+2) and group it with the blend if you plan to move
    it around.\r\n\r\nYou can come up with some interesting effects with this method.
    \r\nHere's a nice tutorial: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bittbox.com/illustrator/fun-with-illustrators-blend-tool/"

    or the 'multiple-copies' solution came up in that thread, iirc. Back then, I posted
    something similar to this as another possible method.\r\n\r\n1. Copy and paste
    into desired position.\r\n2. Pathfinder/Unite, then use Delete Anchor PointTool
    on each letter (the points indicated by the black circles.)\r\n3. Paste a final

    rounds, you have to do some extra work with the pen tool. Or you can use Z's method.\r\n"
