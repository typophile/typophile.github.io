  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">(Excuse me for my english)->First, I must give you details of the background. When I decided to renovate my grandmother house, one year after her death, I found old books, carefully aligned on a bookshelves. The oldest was printed in 1831 (I think that someone else in my family must have something older).

All the books dating back to the first half of XIX century are printed with some 'modern' faces, are very small (12/15 cm height) and don't look like masterpieces of typography. Nothing valuable, I suppose.

Well, my 'project' is to make 'revivals' based on that historical (somewhat 'familiar') material. 

My problem is that I know nothing about the design of typeface revivals (for example my text is in italian, I haven't k, y, x examples), etc. I think I need some advice.

Anyway I started to observe one book printed in Venice in 1842 (an edition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldassare_Castiglione">Baldassarre Castiglione</a>, il Cortigiano) to do some sketches. 
The name of the typographer and publisher is Girolamo Tasso. With a quick search in the database of the italian <a href="http://www.sbn.it/opacsbn/opac/iccu/informazioni.jsp">National Library Service</a> I've found that he printed books from 1819.
I noticed some peculiarity:
1. the Q looks like the Q in Didot (well, the digital version of 'Didot' I've seen) but it hasn't the 'fineness' of Didot
2. the second loop of the lowercase g seems open (particularly in the italic)
3. the oldstyle numbers: 3,4 and 5 usually go below the baseline, here the opposite is true

here are images of the book:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/venezia-39_5056.jpg]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/venezia-49_3980.jpg]

Well, second observation:
Looking in another book, printed in Naples, 1831, I've found something very similar (open g, Q tail like in Didot, oldstyle numbers 3,4 and 5).
The typographer is Francesco Masi and he seems to have worked from 1826 (my research is 'unreliable')

Here are the images of the Naples book

I'm just curious if someone can tell me something more about typefaces with similar features.

thanks,
daniele

I don't have any of my references here with me, so I can't be specific. 

These definitely look like Didot (or in the "school" of Didot). The early Modern styles of Didot and Bodoni were very influenced by the work of Baskerville (ca. 1760s or so). I believe that's where the open lower loop of the 'g' is coming from. 

The unusual alignment of the figures you mentioned is characteristic of the French style of this period -- sometimes called French oldstyle figures -- and can still be seen later in the early 20th century in some of the fonts from the Deberny & Peignot foundry.

But your samples look very similar to reproductions of work by the Didots that I've seen in Updike's <cite>Printing Types</cite>.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Kent,

I can compare these types to the types used in two books printed in Bruxelles around 1845.
But now I want to know more about the Didot family.
