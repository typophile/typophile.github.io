  comes in OpenType and TrueType flavours. \r\n\r\nI'm using MS Office 2004 for Mac.
  The problem is that although the weights contain the special swashes, ligatures
  and other goodies I love, I have no access to them when I select \"insert symbol.\"
  Seems a generic character map shows up. Same thing for the TrueType flavour. \r\n\r\nHow
  can I access these special sets through Word 2004 for Mac?\r\n\r\n"

    I believe there are other out there. It will depend on the kind of work you do
    and how you need to output it. A simple word processing application is fine for
    office-like documents, but not for heavy-graphical documents that need to be offset
    printed.\r\n\r\n> <em>I\u2019m really disappointed.</em>\r\n\r\n(As sorry as I

    OTL features implemented in Windows Office are all language shaping features,
    i.e. features that are active by default for the script and are not considered
    discretionary. Such features are also implemented for the Latin script, e.g. the
    ccmp and mark positioning features. What Office do not support, for any script,
    are features that require user interface."

    user interface. The linguistic OTL features usually are supposed to \"just work\"
    while for user-controlled OTL features you need decent UI. If you look at Adobe's
    inconsistent solutions between Illustrator (OpenType, Character and Glyph palettes),
    InDesign (Character and Glyph palette but no OpenType palette), and Photoshop
    (only Character palette), you'll realize that it's not at all trivial. \r\n\r\nSecond,
    there is the issue of backwards-compatibility in line-breaking. For Arabic or
    Indic scripts, there was constant improvement across Office versions (97, 2000,
    XP, 2003, 2007) which, however, often resulted in text reflow when you open the
    same document in different editors. In this case, the advantage of having ortographically
    more correct handling of the scripts was valued higher than the disadvantage of
    reflow. \r\n\r\nBut for simple scripts, the Office team aimed for consistent line-
    and page-breaks in Word across versions. If at some point, you get ligatures and
    different kerning (GPOS-sourced class kerning vs. traditional plain kerning which
    usually is a subset of the earlier), your documents will certainly reflow. Apparently,
    the advantage of having typographic refinement has not yet outweighed the reflow
    risk in the Microsoft Office team members' heads. \r\n\r\nA."

    This seems to be more or less an industry-standard for new fonts. I have a feeling
    (and I'm sorry that this is no consolation for you) that most font users who specifically
    want to set advanced typographic features do their typesetting virtually soley

    Do your word processing in Word, since it's made (ostensibly) for that, then,
