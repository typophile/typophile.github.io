  body: "I don't know.\r\n\r\nOne could say that it's odd that Apple is so well loved
    as a maverick, while Microsoft, with Bill Gates being so generous, is so roundly
    hated.\r\n\r\nPeople will gravitate to the operating system for which the most
    applications are available. But then they feel upset when one operating system
    becomes so dominant that they don't have a choice.\r\n\r\nBasically, what they
    probably want, even if they haven't articulated it, is for the government to impose
    a standard API for all operating systems, and instruction set for all computers,
    so that choosing between Windows or OS X or OS/2 or BeOS or Linux just means choosing
    performance features... but all program binaries run on all computers, just like
    you can visit any web site with Firefox <em>or</em> Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nThat
    way, you choose the best operating system on performance and features (which one
    comes with better solitare games?) and you don't have to look over your shoulder
    trying to figure out if the application you need will be available for that operating
    system, or whether your peripherals will have drivers for that operating system.\r\n\r\nAll
    programs, including all device drivers, just work on every operating system, because
    they conform to the API standard.\r\n\r\nAmerican consumers just feel entitled
    to having a marketplace where all products are sold as commodity products at commodity
    prices. So instead of buying an operating system for $150 from Microsoft, they
    expect to be able to buy one for, say, $30 from SoftKey (remember them?) with
    no problem, because nasty old Microsoft isn't allowed to lock up its API to prevent
    competing operating systems from running all the same software as its operating
    system can."
