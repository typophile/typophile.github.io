body: I need the Vista and Windows 7 CJK fonts (Malgun, JhengHei and Meiro) on the
  Mac. Microsoft is directing me to the Ascender site, but the fonts are not available
  there. Does anyone know how to obtain these fonts. I'm aware that they are all over
  the internet, but my client would like to find a legal solution...

    for that on Google.   As far as I know, there is no problem using any modern Windows
    fonts for CJK on a Mac.'
