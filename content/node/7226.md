  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s SOLD OUT!!!  The only one I can find is $499 on  Amazon!  I called
  the Font Shop today and they plan to reprint about mid 2005.  The original print
  run was in 1998 and they have just sold out.  I need this book. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?

  body: I guess that wasn&#39;t very helpful. Yes, a new FontBook is underway <BR>and
    I wish it was coming sooner, but this mammoth tome takes <BR>some time to produce.
    I&#39;m fortunate to have a hand in the book  <BR>this time around, so if anyone
    has thoughts about what they  <BR>loved or hated about the original edition please
    let me know.

    1998, and that&#39;s the edition most people like to chat about. <BR> <BR>Si

  body: Stephen, I was always disappointed it had a few gaps, for instance no Hoefler.
    Even if some people decline to participate, so what, their typefaces should be
    in there nonetheless, and the publisher can provide a template to someone who
    has the required fonts licensed, and have them provide a setting for the book.
    <BR> <BR>I have a copy of Mrs Beeton&#39;s Cookbook from the 1920s, with 1400
    pages in one volume, maybe 5&#34; thick -- that&#39;s something to aim for.  <BR>
    <BR>It was a good format, don&#39;t need to change it.  <BR> <BR>However, you
    should remove the slab serif and blackletter categories, too much overlap with
    serif and script categories, causing one to waste time looking for a typeface
    in the wrong section.

  body: Now way dude, Blackletter and Script are totally different. When I want a
    script, I look for scripts. Ditto with Blackletter. Joining them together into
    one &uuml;ber Pen category would just be silly.

    typographic development&#39;. <BR>How much is it worth to me - well, I cannot
    afford to pay anymore than $150. <BR> <BR>I checked on eBay already and no luck.

  body: 'We printed 20 000 back in 1998, so there must be lots of FontBooks gathering
    dust on shelves with the wrong people somewhere. I never use ebay myself for fear
    of getting addicted, but a call there surely must yield results? <BR> <BR>And
    re: Nick: <BR>the whole book is produced from a database with as little manual
    interference as possible, apart from me having to proofread 1300 pages. Inserting
    film generated from outside data would simply make the process way too complicated.
    The database is being redone, a mammoth task, and that is one reason why we&#39;re
    late with a new edition. And it is also a mammoth task financing the beast. We
    may print only 5000 for the first run, but it still takes years to sell them,
    so there&#39;s a lot of capital tied up, which these days isn&#39;t easy to come
    by.'

  body: 'Since we have Mr. Spiekermann&#39;s attention &#40;thanks, btw&#41; let me
    throw in another idea: how about an upgradeable form of binding? 3 ring or similar?
    <BR> <BR>I believe I have three editions of the FontBook, the first one being
    mostly a FF catalogue I believe, and this implies a lot of repetition. Being such
    a monumental task, the book takes a long time, effort, and money to be produced,
    leaving us orphans in between editions. Instead, it could be a binder or collection
    of binders and the editors could periodically release packages with updates, new
    faces, etc. <BR> <BR>I dream of a centralised system/book of font showings that
    would keep up with new releases, even from independent foundries. Be it in print
    form, or printable PDF. I would be willing to subscribe to such a tool, and I
    bet many others would too.'

    <BR>Well: we tried that in the beginning. Apart from the problem of Europe using
    2-hole binders and the US 3-hole ones, you are probably the one user who may upgrade
    his binder. Everyone else told us that the updates we sent them &#40;this was
    back in the early 90s, when the FontBook was only half as thick&#41; were useless.
    They either couldn'
