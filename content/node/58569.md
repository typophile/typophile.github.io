  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bing-logo_4373.gif]\r\n\r\nStill ugly,
    but I've produced a mock version that cleaned up the curves somewhat. Original
    above, my version below. This is really for the benefit of non-Typophiles who
    have trouble expressing or perceiving why the logo is ugly. Quite apart from the
    shapes and proportions themselves, mathematical ellipses just look bad without
    optical correction. The pointier ends need to be rounded a bit. It's one of the
    reasons why squooshing without optical adjustment yields such ugly results."

    interview proved fruitless, a friend emailed me this (below) to remind me of the

    the logo for a cafe inside a pharmacy that opened in January and went out of business
    three months later.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yikes_sm_3946.jpg]\r\n\r\nNo
    way I'd trust a pharmacy that thought THIS was a good idea! (Let alone buy their
