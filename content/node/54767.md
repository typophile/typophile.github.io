body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nBased on [[http://www.typecooker.com|typecooker dot com]]  method,
  I am trying to design a font the works with russian according to the following parameters:\r\n\r\nwidth:
  normal\r\nweight: black\r\nconstruction: roman\r\nstroke endings: sans serif\r\nascender:
  much shorter than x-height\r\ndescender: much shorter than x-height\r\ncontrast
  type: broad nib\r\ncontrast amount: a lot of contrast\r\nstems: straight\r\nintended
  application: multi-purpose\r\nintended size: use very small\r\n\r\nAs I am not a
  user of the cyrillic alphabet, I would like if anyone who knows it could clarify
  2 doubts:\r\n\r\n<strong>A)</strong> The  word \"\u0411\u0443\u043B\u0430\u043A\"
  is clear?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/komsomol_4169.gif]\r\n\r\n<strong>B)</strong>
  For the entire font to serve its purpose correctly in Russian, do I have to design
  the 60 glyps that form the Basic Russian alphabet only? Are there any other glyps
  I will have to design?\r\n\r\nAll your news comments and corrections will be very
  helpful. Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCarlos Fabi\xE1n Camargo G.\r\n\r\n"

    x-height is huge, so I wonder how you can achieve having ascenders being shorter
    than caps height, if that's what you really meant above.\r\n\r\ndescender: much
    shorter than x-height -> it had better be\r\n\r\ncontrast amount: a lot of contrast
    -> this sample doesn't show that at all\r\n"

  body: "For some reason the \"\u0411\" character doesn't seem right to me. I think
    the curvature on the cap (for lack of a better term) is throwing me off--it should
    be flat, or at least more flat. "

  body: "Steve, he must mean that the ascenders <em>from the x-line to the top</em>
    are much shorter than the x-height.\r\n\r\n- In the \u0411 the curvature of the
    bowl clashes with the bottom of the stem.\r\n- For Cyrillic especially, this seems
    a bit narrow to be \"width: normal\".\r\n- Why have a trap in the \u0443 but not
    the \u043A?\r\n- The \u043A is out of character. Try curving an arm and/or a leg.
    Especially since you're dealing with Cyrillic.\r\n- You've nicely sketched the
    inside counters, but the interletter space is just as important.\r\n- The inside
    of the descender of the \u0443 is malformed.\r\n- \"a lot of contrast\" and \"use
    very small\" don't mix.\r\n- What does \"multi-purpose\" mean?\r\n- No spacing
    requirements?\r\n\r\nBTW, in my book that TypeCooker is half-baked.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Carlos,\r\n\r\nThe \u201C\u0411\u201D could be understood in Russian as
    the \u201C\xD1\u201D using acute instead of tilde in Spanish, but its hook shape
    is still not working well. Try making the joining of the arm more angled or designing
    first the \u201C\u0413\u201D.\r\n\r\nRussian alphabet has 33 letters, that\u2019s
    66 glyphs (uppercase + lowercase) if you just need to work in Russian. Here you
    have the Russian alphabet:\r\n\r\n\u0410 \u0411 \u0412 \u0413 \u0414 \u0415 \u0401
    \u0416 \u0417 \u0418 \u0419 \u041A \u041B \u041C \u041D \u041E \u041F \u0420 \u0421
    \u0422 \u0423 \u0424 \u0425 \u0426 \u0427 \u0428 \u0429 \u042A \u042B \u042C \u042D
    \u042E \u042F\r\na \u0431 \u0432 \u0433 \u0434 \u0435 \u0451 \u0436 \u0437 \u0438
    \u0439 \u043A \u043B \u043C \u043D \u043E \u043F \u0440 \u0441 \u0442 \u0443 \u0444
    \u0445 \u0446 \u0447 \u0448 \u0449 \u044A \u044B \u044C \u044D \u044E \u044F\r\n\r\nI
    also suggest using the tail of \u201C\u043B\u201D in \u201C\u043A\u201D letter.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    for some Cyrillic inspiration visit [[http://www.dailytype.ru|Daily Type]] and
    browse the archive\r\n\r\nKeep it going\r\n"

  body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nThank you for your criticism and response. Hrant I
    do not know whether the term \"multi-purpose\" is correct. But what I am trying
    to design is that the font: in small/big reproduction sizes (headlines, captions
    and shorts body text) higher performance under adverse printing conditions (fax,
    fotocopy, etc). \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another exercise <strong>\u201C\u0411\u0443\u043B\u0430\u043A\u201D(black,
    bold and regular)</strong>. All your critique will be welcome. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/komsomol_15feb08_6038.gif]\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCarlos

  body: "I'm liking the new one! The dark weight especially. The lighter weights need
    to get progressively narrower, and looser spaced. If you want to make all the
    weights uniwidth* you can, but: the lighter weights still need more interletter
    space; you will find that the character of the font will change due to a large
    divergence in apparent width (as is happening now) - typically you can only apply
    uniwidth between two relatively close weights without seriously affecting the
    character.\r\n\r\n* Meaning that a given character has the same set width in all
    the weights (something I've done in Patria's two middle weights). The advantage
    is that the user can mix up and change his mind about the weights (let's say in
    which to use for emphasis) without affecting linebreaks etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking
    at the dark weight:\r\n- I wouldn't taper the bottom of the counter of the \"\u0443\".\r\n-
    Since this is supposed to be usable small, the top of the \u043A needs to be more
    open; you might have to make the whole thing wider.\r\n- Also stemming from the
    intended small usage: the counter of the \"\u0430\" should be larger; although
    here it looks like you have room without making the glyph wider.\r\n- Try to standardize
    (maybe into two angles if not one) the shears, here at the tips of \"\u0443\",
    \"\u043B\" and \"\u0430\"; I like the one in the \"\u0443\".\r\n- What bothers
    me most is the messy conjunction between the counters and bottoms of \"\u0411\"
    and \"\u0430\"; what I might try to do is continue the arc from the bottom into
    the corner of the counter (I'm not sure that's clear).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
