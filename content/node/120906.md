body: "I was trying to replicate the appearance of this portion of the Anglican Missal,
  and was stymied in trying to identify the main body face. In particular, the lower-case
  \u201Cr\u201D with its slight upward reach, and the \u201Cg\u201D (which I know
  should be a giveaway) elude me. It looks a little like a Clarendon, and little like
  a Cheltenham, but not exactly like either, to my eye.\r\n\r\nI promise I'll moan,
  smack my forehead, and say \u201COf course!\u201D if the answer is as obvious as
  I fear it will be.\r\n\r\nMany thanks \u2014"

  body: Based on the g, I'd say it's some variation of Cheltenham, but that high-nosed
    r is the sticking point.

  body: "That was my observation as well \u2014 it should be a giveaway, but I can't
    spot it in another face.\r\n\r\nIt compares interestingly to Berthold Sorbonne
    and Paratype Academy, but these are slightly higher in contrast, and without the
    reaching \u201Cr\u201D and (I notice, not in the sample) relatively straight lower-case
    \u201Cf\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Anglican Missal is curious, as it is composed
    of separate bodies of prayers set in differing faces. The bit I\u2019m looking
    at now is \u201CPrayers Before Mass,\u201D but each subsequent section employs
    slightly (or markedly) different type. The \u201CProper Masses\u201D section uses
    a face whose \u201Cr\u201D is more conventional, and whose \u201Cl\u201D upper
    serifs are angled rather than square.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested, it\u2019s

  body: "Cheltenham as shown in the ATF 1923 Specimen Book is a match. The alternate
    _r_, with its arm raised above x-height, was provided with the various Cheltenham
    fonts. Here is the bold and extra bold version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheltenhamBoldAndExtraboldAndWideATF1923_4254.jpg]\r\nMac
    McGrew explains: \"The alternate form of r, with its arm raised above x-height,
    has also been criticized, but this is mostly the result of misuse. It is disturbing
    within a word, but adds a bit of grace at the end of a word.\" Source: American

    perhaps there is a version that does.\r\nDon"
