  alt=\"\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" /></a>Rockne is based on samples of mid-20th
  century wood type in a style which was clearly an influence on the poster lettering
  of the 1960s as demonstrated in our <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=butterfield\">Butterfield</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=harbinger\">Harbinger</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=pantagruel\">Pantagruel</a>.
  \ It clearly comes out of the Art Nouveau tradition, and with wood type already
  obsolete at the time the font was made, it presents a chronological anomaly and
  seems to fit in the gap between the art nouveau period and the psychedelic art movement.\r\n\r\nYou
  can <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/images/rocknedemo.zip\"> download and try</a>
  the demo version of Rockne in TrueType format for Mac or PC.  The full version of
  the font is available from our <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=rockne\">ordering

    what that one was called?)
