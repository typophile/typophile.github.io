  body: "Don't know about Hungary but Quicky carries connotations in English.\r\nI
    have to wonder about the figure, it doesn't seem to be leaping anything in particular,
    I mean he is not going to clear the whole word left to right and the movement
    doesn't seem background to foreground. As Grot has mentioned smaller sizes might
    require a simplified drawing to avoid filling in.\r\nTim"

  body: Even at that size, your logo (inc. Quicky) wordmark will still be large. Post
    it back, along with your wordmark, and you'll see that it's still big. Even in
    print at a smaller size, this will fill in because it's fiddly and you also have
    to take into consideration what it looks like when photocopied/faxed and signage/t-shirts/whatever
    else that is printed but not necessarily high quality. Also Tim's picked up on
    a big point - here in the UK, the word Quicky would carry the connotation of a
    quick shag - maybe the guy's bed-hopping? ;)

    body: "OK Guys!\r\n\r\nI understand the name problem. Let's leave it because we
      can change that. We are not in the phase where we can't.\r\n\r\nThe fill in
      problem. I don't think it would happen because,\r\n1. Printing on a T-shirt
      - (as you know for sure) - It is a different technique. So that is another topic.\r\n2.
      300 dpi - fairly enough for even more detailed graphics-if you use black-it
      is a SPOT color. There are no dots-That's why we can print out 3 pt letters.
      :)\r\n3. Fax/Photocopy - Let's use bigger logo and letters! :)\r\nI use 9 pt
      letters even for the address...ect.\r\n\r\nBut the \"size\" connection between
      the wordmark and the illustration= The word mark is too big - I agree. "

  body: "Ear, nose, temple, hands, t-shirt sleeve, forearms, creases on both thighs
    are all losing detail in your smaller image, print it on newsprint or in a phone
    book and it will have trouble, it's not just the dpi but the absorbency of the
    paper, the pressure used to pass on the ink for both gravure and litho, coarse
    screen for screen printing etc. but if you can live with that then that is your
    choice. Equally important to my mind is that the figure seems to be jumping for
    no particular reason (unless he has just had a quicky:) \r\nTim"

      talking about the design but talking about my feelings about design.\r\nWhat
      I think of graphic design: it's freedom but without control U R not jumping
      but falling...\r\nI'm bored with minimalism and useless simplification. Most
      of the cases -in logodesign for xmpl- simplification comes from the lack of
      drawing ability.\r\nSo in my case the base -wich is drawing- very important.\r\nSo
      i think this way of thinkink is also OK:\r\n\"Wich firm? Ah! The jumpig guy!\"\r\nIs
      it really important to underline the Graphic design?\r\nFor xmpl \"xy interactive\"-with
      a jumpig guy , it is up to you what u r thinking about the illustration wich
      articulates freedom..."

  body: I get the feeling that this is totally up in the air - you seem now to be
    trying to tailor a potential name to the illustration - which is a problem. Identify
    exactly what it is that you want to communicate and start over. It's not that
    I dislike the jumping guy (I don't), I just don't think it's suitable for purpose,
    as discussed previously. If you don't pin anything solid down, like your company
    name, you have no foundations on which to develop your identity

      body: "I re-read all the comments and i realized that the core of the ciritics
        is this: - \r\nProblems with the first version:\r\n1. Quicky - connotations\r\n2.
        Make clear connection between the illustration and the wordmark otherwise
        it will be confusing\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that: If i can find a word wich
        says-jump, leap or spring or breakthrough but one can understand it also as
        a mental process i can keep the guy.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that - i will
        try the logo with some scripts also. Maybe it will be more united with the
        handmade illustration!\r\n\r\nIf it will be ready i will post it to this topic!
