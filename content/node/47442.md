  lurker on this forum, with no professional use for new type.\r\nAlso at home I use
  (the love which dare not speak its name) linux, which of course comes with free
  fonts of varying distinction. But I wanted a neo-grotesk other than the included
  rather staid \"stand-ins\", chiefly designed to allow document compatibility with
  your non-linux colleagues.\r\n  So I bought my first font (other than with an application).
  I feel quite excited really. I chose Dyna Grotesk R, in TrueType format. Four styles
  for about 17GBP - amazing! OpenType is better I am sure, but TT gives me instant
  access in my word processor.\r\n  There are some very handsome grotesks out there,
  including National, FF Bau, Brown Gothic etc, but after flipping for a while I chose
  the Storm product. For one thing I liked the subtle distinction between upper-case
  'i' and lower-case 'l'. I use \"The Iliad\" as a type sample to test this out!\r\n\r\n

  must be here!\r\n\r\nPaul\r\nEngland\r\n  "

  body: "Hi.  You're not taking up anyone's time.  Good to hear that even someone
    with \"no professional use for new type\" can see fit to buy a font once in a
    while.  Maybe this is the start of something for you, where you start to appreciate
    the different between some nasty looking free fonts, and really get to admire
    the skill of the designers who put in that extra effort to make something that's
    worth paying for.\r\n\r\nGood on ya.\r\n\r\nJH"
