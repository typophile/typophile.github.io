body: "The staff of my high school newspaper is planning a sex and sexuality census
  to be distributed to every student in grades 9 through 12 (approximately 500 students).
  I was wondering if I could get some criticism on my rough, current design of the
  census and teacher instructions sheet (attached). I will resist the urge to discuss
  the content and methodology of the census further since it is outlined in near-exhaustive
  detail in the census itself.\r\n\r\nFor the design, I am using the same typefaces
  we use for the newspaper after my recent redesign of it to suggest a connection
  with the newspaper: Farnham Display, Mercury Text, and Myriad Pro. Despite my attempts
  to make the design aesthetically pleasing, so far it's not so beautiful, partly
  owing to the amount of text we need to cram onto one piece of paper and the desire
  to make the text decent size. While suggestions to make it easier on the eyes would
  be greatly appreciated, I'd most like to hear ways to make it clearer and less ambiguous,
  both design-wise and content-wise. Is there anything that confuses you, even for
  a second?\r\n\r\nOne final note: I have pseudo-redacted out the name of the school
  newspaper, the school, and some other possibly identifying information. If I missed
  any identifying information, please mention it to me either here or by private message
  so that I can remove it. Thanks very much."

  body: "Try using two (or possibly three) columns, your present measure is too wide.
    For the purpose of data capture it might be sensible to number the questions and
    letter the answers. Try out using a tick (or cross) box for the answers, much
    clearer than circling answers and take up less vertical space. You could also
    try making all the tabs the same which should improve the first appearance. I
    have to question the requirement to write gender, two tick boxes would do, similarly
    with grade you don't need the space given it. You should find that you have more
    space to allow for the further comments, alternatively make the request to write
    on the back and provide rules to follow, the current space is too small and you
    will get a cramped area filled with writing. The bold sans in the instructions
    is way too heavy try using the bold variant of Mercury.\r\nTim\r\nbtw censuss
    on the 3rd line of additional information."

  body: Thanks a lot, Tim. Some of these comments I thought of (like having multiple
    columns) but decided against because I was worried about introducing confusion,
    no matter how minor. I'll try to spiffify it up a bit according to your thoughts.

  body: "As long as you keep the introductory copy in one section and the questionnaire
    in another beneath it I don\u2019t see how you are going to create confusion by
    putting it in columns, but you know your audience. Perhaps you could just use
    the columns for the questionnaire section.\r\nTim"

  body: "I would also consider putting the \"yes/no\" answers to the right of the
    questions, aligned, rather than underneath. Also, where you have left room for
    \"gender\" and \"level\", I would make gender a \"M/F\" answer as well as putting
    the answer spot to the right of the question. \r\n\r\nThis could free up some
    vertical space which would allow you to space out some of the instructional text.
    I don't think it will be confusing mixed with the other questions where the answers
    clearly need to be listed under the question.\r\n\r\nYou could also introduce
    check boxes next to the answers rather than the slashes that you have now. \r\n\r\nI
    haven't read it yet for clarity of content, but I'll get back to you if I see
    anything odd. "

  body: "Hey, a couple more comments regarding content.\r\n\r\nYou might consider
    rewording the first question to \"which statement most accurately describes how
    you view your sexuality\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nI see problems with the
    term \"serious relationship\" because the definition may vary from one person
    to the next. Some might think it's time based, others might think it has to do
    with intensity of emotion... However, if what you're after is simply that the
    respondant sees him or herself as being in a \"serious relationship\" then it
    works.\r\n\r\n\"to reprint all of or excerpts from...\" could be rephrased. \r\n\r\n\"when
    a student has finished, collect their\" -- this doesn't agree in number. It should
    be \"when the students have finished, collect their\" or \"when a student has
    finished, collect his/her\"\r\n\r\nLastly, a personal irritant, is \"We of the\"
    You can be less wordy! Go for \"we believe...\"  -- by now the people reading
    the survey know who the \"we\" represents.\r\n\r\nOne more, actually -- I wonder
    if all the students who will be responding know what \"sexual intercourse\" is.
    I don't mean to suggest  kids are stupid, but definitions vary wildly... Are you
    going for the student's concept of what constitutes \"sexual intercourse\" or
    the technical definition? You may want to clarify with a definition or you may
    want to use a different term, like penetration.\r\n\r\nK.  "
