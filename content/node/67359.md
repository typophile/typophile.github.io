body: "I've recently learned how to use Fontlab Studio 5, and I also learned how to
  script ligatures. But I noticed Illustrator for example has more buttons in the
  type tool section: Standard Ligatures, Contextual Ligatures, Discretionary Ligatures,
  Swash, Stylistic Alternates, Titling Alternates, Ordinals and Fractions.\r\n\r\nSo
  out of that list, I only know how to script the standard ligatures. Does anyone
  know how to script the others, or do you know a source to learn about it? Most font
  families contain all the ligatures and swash letters as seperate fonts rather than
  putting it into a single font (OpenType). Is there a reason for doing this?"

  body: "here is a technical answer. \r\nThe technique is the same as the ligature,
    \ using the FEATURE.  \r\nOf course you need new \"generated glyph\" for the subtitution
    (eg: \"f_f_l\", \"T_h\").\r\n\r\nFEATURE\r\nfor ligature is LIGA\r\nfor Discretionary
    ligature is DLIG\r\nfor Contextual ligature is CALT\r\netc.\r\nWiki can help:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is some
    example:\r\nfeature liga {\r\n    sub f f b by f_f_b;\r\n    sub f f h by f_f_h;\r\n
    \   sub f f i by ffi; \r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nfeature dlig {\r\n    sub T H   by T_H;\r\n
    \   sub T T   by T_T;\r\n    sub T h   by T_h;\r\n    sub s p   by s_p;\r\n    sub
    s t   by s_t;\r\n} dlig;\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\n    sub T H E by T_H_E;\r\n}

    to go these days is to put all these alternates into a single font\u2026 unless
    your users are in a software who doesn\u2019t know how to handle OpenType features."

  body: "Thank you for your answers. It was most helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if
    anyone knows why Photoshop doesn't support OpenType, or did I just not see it?
    I also can't find the function in InDesign. I'm sure it will be available in Photoshop
    CS5."

    photoshop it's more basic an option is apply to all your text. \r\nIn InDesign
    you can you do it on a single Glyph\r\n\r\nin design go to main menu: WINDOW /

    OpenType in Photoshop. I didn't know how to use it in InDesign yet though. Thanks
    a lot for the information!

    years ago. Meanwhile I've had several jobs where I had to use InDesign daily.\r\n\r\nThis
    is pretty amusing though. When I was still studying I was the go-to guy in the
    class for tips on typography and InDesign functionality while two years ago I
    couldn't even find the OpenType panel."
