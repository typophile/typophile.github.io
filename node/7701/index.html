The thicker tapers of the ends of the &quot;3&quot; work a bit better, due I think to the tighter nature of the curves (that may temper somewhat my criticism of the &quot;2&quot; &ndash; but not completely <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ). Take another look at the &quot;2&quot;, in any event. Perhaps a tighter angle between the main stroke and the base may be an alternate solution. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The gentle curve and taper of the &quot;4&quot; is really elegant, and plays well off of the &quot;7&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">The Arabic writing system has horizontal stress, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and that's the origin of the Latin numerals. The thing is, in the &quot;conventional&quot; Latin scheme the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;5&quot; have a mix of h and v stress, the &quot;7&quot; is mostly (sometimes entirely) h, the &quot;4&quot; has this wierd diagonal, and the rest are all v stress. Watduhel?! I'm actually a big fan of variation, but this is just arbitrary (in the same way that so many typographic traditions are). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've tried to bring a method to the madness, but I'm actually just as unhappy with the &quot;2&quot; as you are. I think/hope that the &quot;5&quot; and &quot;4&quot; work great, and the &quot;7&quot; would work better in a serif face (where it could get a beak -and maybe foot serifs- to fill the void). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;2&quot; might just need to be wider. Or maybe you're right that the diagonal needs to become straight[er] (and thinner) at the bottom (instead of turning back). Another thing about the &quot;2&quot; is that it has a stiff spine (with a totally straight segment in there), and maybe that ruins it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, great idea about making the &quot;7&quot;'s diagonal echo the &quot;4&quot;'s more (at the top).

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed&hellip;. I had to fight my first impulse to ask for a thinning at the top of the curve of the &quot;2&quot;, and a thickening of its base stroke. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have been intrigued by your previous challenges to the conventional mixed-stress figure structure, and I think what you are doing here with uniformly vertical stress is equally interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmmm&hellip; On looking at it a second time, maybe the &quot;2&quot; could benefit from the same curve (if not the taper) that you used in the &quot;4&quot; (and will apply to the &quot;7&quot;). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;5&quot; does indeed work very well, as, I think, does the &quot;3&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">The more I think about this, the more I get confused&hellip;  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can build a set of &quot;normal&quot; numerals and make them work 90%, but I won't really be happy until I can justify what I've made. Imitating precedent has its merits, but doing so because of intellectual sloth is just&hellip; sucky. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why give the numerals consistent vertical stress? Does it help low-level readability, or does it just satisfy our Modernist desire for Regularity? It's the former that intrigues me most, but I think in the latter I at least have a safety net: giving the numerals v stress makes them visually harmonious with the alphabetic glyphs. The question is, do they *reduce* readability?&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The thing is, no glyph is pure text or pure display. During my &quot;Alphabet Reform&quot; project I realized that you simply cannot *show* structures: they can only be *explained* (something graphic designers don't seem to like to do, btw). That's why &quot;theoretical&quot; alphabets (like Bayer's &quot;Universal&quot;) are always ugly - they have to be seen as a conceptual compromise, not usable things. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So any actual glyphs I make/show inescapably represent parts of an actual font, something that can be used at different sizes, in different ways. Among other things, this brings the conflict between aesthetics and functionality to the fore. Specifically: my &quot;2&quot;'s spine makes it structurally divergent from some other numerals, which makes it more legible; my &quot;1&quot; has that ugly bar because it helps pull it away from the UC &quot;I&quot; and lc &quot;el&quot;; my &quot;3&quot; has a sag in its waist because that makes it more of a 3 (and not because Garamond did it); and many other such machinations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So your/my ideas for making the &quot;2&quot; more pleasing would make it less legible. Legibility isn't everything, and I sacrifice it myself sometimes (for example, that &quot;8&quot; is not ideal, but the &quot;optimal&quot; structure I have in mind is simply too ugly), but knowing where to strike the balance depends on so many factors! For example, if these numerals were meant for marking addresses on houses, the &quot;1&quot;'s bar would go. But if they were meant for telephone books, I would dig out my ugly &quot;8&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The more versatile you make a face, the less well it will perform in specific applications. Look at Tracy's Adsans. It's ugly, but man, does it ever *work*. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Speaking of other existing fonts, I was looking through the Rookledge Typefinder (again&hellip;), and I actually found a font that implements v stress for numerals in a largely pleasing way: Egyptian 505. And who designed (or at least directed) it? Gurtler, one of my very favorite designers!  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(BTW, Gill I worship, but his attempts at v-stress numerals I can't stand to look at.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other side of the spectrum, there are also fonts (though very rare) which give horizontal stress to the *alphabetics*! Like Excoffon's Olive, of course, but also Bloemsma's Balance. What's interesting is that they also make *all* the numerals have h stress. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Courage, Camille. :D <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your point about balancing aesthetics and legibility is well taken. I'd be curious to see the two different extremes as applied to this design. Dig out that ugly &quot;8&quot;, as well as the rest of the discarded alternates, and parade them for us. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I often find when constructing a font that the glyphs that I think aren't working are simply reacting badly with other glyphs that are the real culprits. Also, sometimes when I think a glyph isn't working, it turns out to be simply my discomfort with a design that I'm not used to, but the design itself turns out to work very well, thank you very much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's like what all those folks at Emigre keep saying: We read best what we read most. Or something like that. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Legibility borrows a great deal from familiarity. The moral (if there is one) may be, without overstating it: don't discard an innovation because it is unfamiliar. I think what you're attempting is worth the investigation, and I think you're getting somewhere with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also think you may be right about the &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot;. As I look at them today, they work. And I think that's a splendid example of the point in my previous paragraph. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm making alternates for 2 and 7 (and maybe 6/9 too), and here's an 8 from a font I did about two years ago. I think it's *structurally* optimal in terms of legibility. But it's too grunge. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, when it comes to familiarity, I agree that it's important. But I also think too many designers use Emigre's mantra as an escape from having to look the beast that is Readability in the eye. You can't just make whatever shape that turns you on, if you care about reading comfort: there are realities about our retina, our brain, etc. which make some fonts inherently less readable than others. For one thing, the reason there's a difference between legibility and readability is proof that familiarity cannot be all-important. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This doesn't mean I or anybody else understands -or can ever understand- readability completely. But *that* doesn't mean we should try to understand it more. It might not be very sexy, but you don't marry the sexiest person you know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm a big champion of innovation, but only when it makes things better for users/readers, not to stroke my own ego. There are so many stale, dysfunctional traditions in typography - they have to be fixed. But too many designers think of themselves are &quot;artiste&quot;s, and are too afraid/lazy/dumb to consider the intricacies of immersive reading. These people will never make a real text font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lastly, about your &quot;conversion&quot; on the 6/9: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe in the separation of conscious observation of shapes versus the quick-and-dirty reality of our subconscious reading mechanism. What does this mean? It means that a layman simply cannot look at a glyph and declare if it's highly readable or not - we cannot hope to understand our subconscious directly. For example, there have been many tests done asking readers to choose the most readable font out of a set, then they measure the actual reading speeds of the various fonts. Invariably, the most readable font is smaller than the one readers think is best. What the readers are consciously choosing actually has to do with *legibility*, not readbaility. And the two have a congruence of only about 50%. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, how can we find out if a given glyph works or doesn't? 1) Do a lot of good field testing. 2) Simply *think* about it as much as possible (instead of running away saying &quot;it doesn't matter&quot;), using your understanding of how humans read. That's Craft. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello again&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope that type designers will study your work, Hrant, as the conventional stress, or rather lack of stress, is aesthetically horrible. When it comes to readability, it seems that you know much more than me. But I think that a consistent stress could benefit readability (although it would reduce legibility by reducing variation) as it calms down and strictens the overall impression (and so the readers mind) and sets the focus on individual variation. It seems to me that readability is much about regularity vs irregularity, and trying to walk the thin line between these two abysses. Your thoughts are indeed interesting, and it</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First, Anders, thanks for your encouragement - I happen to need it right now&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My understanding of readability is still shallow. The only real credit I can take (and am proud to take) is that unlike many designers I *care* about readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About your suggestion for the &quot;4&quot;: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've always liked open-top &quot;4&quot;s, but they kind of stop working well in darker weights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the advantages of straight versus curve, that's a very interesting line of thought. In terms of legibility of numerals you want each number to be as different as possible (as you implied), so a totally straight-lined &quot;4&quot; is best. But in terms of readability, no glyph should stand out too much in terms of *structure* (even though I'm still unsure about the merits of totally even color). For example, I think the conventional lc &quot;g&quot; (the bicameral one with the closed descender) is too different from the rest of the alphabet: I make my text &quot;g&quot;s with an open descender. In fact that's the best justification for making all the numerals completely v-stressed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;6&quot;/&quot;9&quot;: I'm starting to think they need to be open, like you said.
