  my problem. I've pigeon holed myself by presenting an idea of a Tree using the letter
  T as the trunk. Then that T is reflected again in the name of the company.\r\n\r\nSo
  I'm on the search for a font that fits this description; gender-neutral, warm, inviting,
  comfortable, whimsical, while still looking professional. The T of this font needs
  to be workable as a tree trunk...it definitely seems to work best when the T has
  sloping serifs at the bottom kind of like roots. \r\n\r\nI've tried a ton and am
  not really happy with anything yet. I hope someone can help!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trees_3595.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's some idea
    of what I'm aiming for. The trunks are all T's from different typefaces. Some
    work as a trunk, some not so much, but the main part of what I'm not liking about
    them is the font as a whole. The font will also be used in the company name so
    i need something that fits those adjectives i listed."

  body: "Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nSorry if starting a new one is inappropriate. I wasn't
    getting much of a response over there and this time my question was much more
    specific. I'm looking for typeface suggestions that fit what I've been searching
    for rather than critique on the logo.\r\n\r\nDo you think I should delete this
    post and merge it with my other one?"

  body: "My advice is to stop trying to find a font with a T that looks like a tree
    trunk.  \r\nIt's ok if the the \"Tree T\" is in a different style from the rest
    of the text.  \r\n\r\nOrnate Symbol + Elegant/Simple Text = Good"
