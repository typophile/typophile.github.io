  body: As I understand it, the default character set used by Flash is quite small,
    and omits characters such as the Euro and curly apostrophe. However, isn't it
    possible to specify a larger character set to embed in the Flash file? (Although
    that gives away more of the shop to pirates.)

    I haven't worked with Adobe's upgrade yet."
