  body: My guess is that it's a particular signmaker's adaptation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451">DIN
    1451</a>. It has a flavor the digital adaptation lacks - the latter may be a bit
    too cleaned up and fontlike, if grunge and authenticity is what you're after.

  body: Street sign might be a misleading term. It reads "Parking forbidden, driveway".
