  body: I think SoftMaker is creating another version of Publicity Gothic, but under
    license from URW++ and features an exact lowercase character set like the Image
    Club Graphics version, which is called "Private" (which come in regular, small
    caps, and old-style figured parts), according to Martin Kotulla.   Oh, there's
    one more thing, SoftMaker's original version of Publicity Gothic is "P850 Deco"
    (which is all-uppercase only), and both font names are appearing on SoftMaker's
    "MegaFont XXL 3.0" and "infiniType 4" premium-quality typeface collections - both
    of which were being released on May 27, 2014.
