  I was wondering this: How should I make my test-prints? \r\nWhat kind of paper?
  \r\nThe letters in dark-grey or black? \r\nBleached paper or not? \r\nWhat settings
  in Adobe Reader?\r\nor anything else I might need to know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper

  body: "Laser printer or inkjet?\r\n\r\nThe kind of paper and whether or not it's
    bleached is immaterial, as long as it's reasonably smooth and fairly bright: rough
    paper might introduce artifacts which don't reflect the actual quality of the
    outlines. Likewise, screening the letters may distort the outlines, so pure black
    would be preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It depends on the typeface. If it's a text face, then you should make some
    test documents that have text set in the way you aim the typeface to be used.
    Is it a book text typeface then set some representative pages of a literary text.
    Is it a newspaper typeface then design a mock newspaper. Is it a dictionary typeface,
    then design a few pages of a mock dictionary. You get the idea?\r\n\r\nAlso, you
    should choose a language for which you design the typeface. From one language
    to another there are different frequencies of characters, of ascenders and descenders,
    diacritical marks, and capitalization rules (German capitalizes all proper nouns
    eg.). This can change the colour and texture of the columns of text a great deal.\r\n\r\nPoints
    to consider: Stick to one point size of your test text so you can compare changes
    to the typeface design by comparing your stack of prints. Annotate the prints
    with the font version and the date and time it was printed. You can setup Indesign
    to do the date & time automatically.\r\n\r\nExpand the sophistication of the test
    document as you add glyphs and features to the font.\r\n\r\nFind one acceptable
    quality high resolution laser-printer. Compare it's output to off-set printed
    materials. Some laser-printers are too dark, others too light, some are quite
    close to off-set print, but they are always unsharp/low-resolution.\r\n\r\nYou
    should print in black if it's a text typeface you are designing. Greyscale is
    pointless.\r\n\r\nAs for paper, choose something close to the intended medium
    as per my preceding remarks.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a design down on your laser-printer,
    try to have it off-set printed to fine tune the design."

  body: "<cite>What kind of paper?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe cheapest office paper that will
    run through your laser printer without making it jam. Because once you get serious
    about your proofs you will be printing a LOT. Right now I\u2019m finishing up
    a family with eight masters and blasting through a few hundred pages of proofs
    a week.\r\n\r\n<cite>The letters in dark-grey or black?</cite>\r\n\r\nBlack\u2014grey
    is not a solid color.\r\n\r\n<cite>Bleached paper or not?</cite>\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    bleached, because most printing is done on white paper.\r\n\r\n<cite>What settings
    in Adobe Reader?</cite>\r\n\r\nSet up your proofs in a layout program, you shouldn\u2019t
    be using Adobe Reader at all. I do almost all of my proofing in Indesign, which
    is very convenient because it makes it very easy to swap out fonts throughout
    the document and I can create looping nested styles for proofs that compare multiple
    fonts character-by-character. "
