  specifically for osx. i don't know very much about font-exporting and the rasterization
  process, but i'm told that i font-hinting doesn't work on osx because quartz doesn't
  listen to the hints. is there any other method of optimizing fonts for small sizes
  on macs? the only other solution i can think of is to make separate font files for
  each size\u2026 and that just seems downright sloppy.\r\n\r\nsorry this is a bit
  of a novice question, but my usual solution of scouring the internet for an answer
  hasn't been pointing me in any helpful directions.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance!"

  body: "IMO, fonts look fine for the Mac if the stem widths are consistent, and if
    glyph shapes (especially vertical extrema on curves) are consistent with regards
    to the alignment zones. Then, auto-hint in FontLab.\r\n\r\nI also suggest that
    you experiment with the Blue Scale value (Type 1 hinting: global hinting parameters):
    I usually set it to 8 pts."

  body: 'Nick, none of the hinting effects Mac rendering as you know, and the stem
    widths are only consistent if you add up the colors used to represnt each stem,
    which most people do, it seems. Vertical alignment and precise stem weight from
    a single outline font are out of the designers or type engineer''s scope of influence
    on the Mac, except in the choices made in the design of the single outline''s
    contours themselves. No tricks, no hints. As for the dotting of the i  and crossing
    of the t, these things are trade secrets, ;) '

  body: Read "Learn Fontlab Fast". There's some petty solid info about doing this
    in there. You should also really study truetype hinting in the fontlab manual.
    You're gonna have to work very hard on that. Only truetype hinting will make the
    font look good at small sizes.

  body: "fd2> Only truetype hinting will make the font look good at small sizes.\r\n\r\nThis
    is true, but don't forget that only a little bit of TT hints are interpreted by
    most anti-aliasing windows machines and no mac anti-aliasing machines. \r\n\r\nSo,
    only truetype hinting can make <em>some of the font</em> look good at small sizes,
    and the rest of making a font look good is left up to Microsoft and Apple at the
    rasterizing end. "

  body: A short description of this is that the font's parameters to be fed to a rasterizer
    without hints are simplified in their diversity, and optical sizing is used to
    exaggerate the important features. That helps both Mac and Win, then the Win version
    needs hints to assure hairline appearance and alignment. There is a discussion
    of this <a href="http://typophile.com/node/80015">here</a>, in the context of
    Beat Stamm's expanded 1997 paper on hinting.
