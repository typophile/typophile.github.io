body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm a graduate graphic designer who really wants a proper education
  in typography! I've been signing up to dozens of typography foundries and browsing
  forums to try and understand the complex world of type. This forum has been extremely
  helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm starting a project for a new small company in the medical field.
  It's a medication review which offers a more holistic service...it's hard to explain!
  They need a logo, brochure, letterhead, report, website etc.\r\n\r\nThe font has
  to be professional, simple, and maybe with a slightly 'caring' feel to it. It's
  aimed at medical professionals, hospitals etc. Doctors get heaps of promotional
  material so I think that using a quality font or complete font package, along with
  good graphic design, could help catch their eye.\r\n\r\nWhat would be a professional-yet-modern-yet-caring
  typeface? I'm open to using a combination of typefaces or a type family to create
  this brand.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it, but it looks good. Their website doesn't let me link to Fresco, but go here:\r\nhttp://www.ourtype.be/home.htm\r\n\r\n...and
    wait for the Flash to load, then navigate to Fresco and its related faces.\r\n\r\nAlso
    on their site, check out Eva.\r\n\r\nor how about Adobe's <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1734\">
    Cronos</a>?\r\n\r\nGiven the wide use you're contemplating be sure to check the
    EULA's for any fonts you consider. You want to be sure you can use the fonts in
    PDFs, for example.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Geez, what a website John! Nice.\r\n\r\nmig85 i'm a graphic designer too
    and on my case would get a classic typeface. Palatino, Bodoni and so on and on
    are good classical typefaces. The only problem is that they are user a lot (Bodoni
    for example is part of Vogue's logo).\r\nI would recommend you one of my ex-teacher
    [[http://www.dstype.com|Dino dos Santos]]. He has really good typefaces. Check
    them.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound & visual"
