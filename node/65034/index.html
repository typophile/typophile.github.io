  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am working on a research-style article about type over the past ten years. In today&rsquo;s information age, it seems that as much happens in ten years now-a-days as did in a century before the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to discuss the following (this is a rough, off the cuff list):</p>
<p>• Type design ( the actual type faces, the designers, technology, driving forces behind new designs, and so on)
• How type is being distributed (things like the smaller foundry, and so on)
• The good the bad and the ugly (I couldn&rsquo;t resist)
• Trends in type design and typography
• The ever changing world of web type (things like typekit, browser changes, etc)</p>
<p>I would like some input as to what you would like to see in such an article. Who should I interview?</p>
<p>Also, if you have a tip, a resource, an article with valuable info that could be used in my research, please share!</p>
<p>I am excited about this project, and a little nervous! Thanks all!</p>

<p>Well, there was the Incunabula.
I imagine Venice at the time of Jenson et al was pretty intense.</p>
<p>Your project is vast.
There was an article a few years ago in Eye, about how the type world had matured into a more business-oriented entity after the experiments of the digital revolution, which might make a reference point on which bases to touch.</p>

I had recently been slagging the same old stuff (Helvetica etc.) so thought it was time to wax positive.
What strikes me now is the huge proliferation of new designs since then. Many of these are not just interesting deconstructions (which was prevalent in the previous decade), but thorough and sophisticated type systems.
IMO the two things driving this are both represented in the OpenType format: broader language support and expert typography (small caps, alternate figures, contextual alternates, etc.) via OT features.</p>

<p>Concerning Legato: I admit that statement seems over-the-top, but I really don&rsquo;t like sensationalism (evidence: I&rsquo;m a fan of text faces much more than display faces). However, from the -admittedly esoteric- things I&rsquo;ve come to value in type design over the years, there really hasn&rsquo;t been anything as significant. And anybody who&rsquo;s been paying attention will admit this is not an isolated, irrational sentiment; many many people believe Legato is extremely special, at the very least.</p>

<p>Yes, it is esoteric and special, and of course it is significant in the smaller sense, as most new typefaces are, but not in the larger sense of having a great effect on the type world, which is the least one would expect of anything touted as &ldquo;most significant&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>[Semi-existential theorization ahead. I&rsquo;m only gonna do this once.]</p>
<p>I believe that media, tools, and processes shape results. And I think the story of digital type (in the sense both of type being <em>produced</em> and <em>used</em> digitally), in the broader context of digitalization in toto, can be compared to &ldquo;paradigm shifts&rdquo; in other medial contexts, following the advent of new media – like for instance the oft-cited invention of photography (and how it developed vis-à-vis painting); film and how it found its own language apart from the theater; or more recently, the advent of the WWW, as opposed to print media.
We are, I think, presently caught in the middle of this shift.</p>
<p>I am basing the following on my reading of German media theorist, Michael Giesecke. He observes – which I think is a very plausible working model – that such &ldquo;paradigm shifts&rdquo; in media typically develop over three phases (which however aren&rsquo;t clearly delimited, especially not chronologically):</p>
<p>The <em>first phase</em> sees the new medium imitating the old medium, both in terms of æsthetics and functionality. See for example the first web pages that inherently consisted of long scrolling text, &ldquo;as if it was printed&rdquo;; or the first films that were essentially theater scenes with a camera where the audience would sit. 
In type, this is where I&rsquo;d place not only revivals, but also type produced today that emulates old models without adding much of a new perspective, citing familiarity as a basic virtue. What&rsquo;s quite baffling BTW is that chirographic type isn&rsquo;t only stuck in imitating the <em>previous</em> medial model (which would be phototype, or metal) – but it&rsquo;s even stuck in imitating the ancient medial model that came before that!
[Note: Since type is a tool rather than simply an art form, work that appears stuck in this phase might have more value/importance than in other fields, or maybe just take longer to lose its relevance.]</p>
<p>The <em>second phase</em>, which typically sets in rather quickly, is about experimentation, and radical emancipation of the New from the Old. That&rsquo;s where your deconstruction comes in, the articles set in Wingdings, fonts that experiment on the formal front (You Can Read Me, etc) as well in terms of new technological possiblities (like Beowulf). The results of this kind of work/search aren&rsquo;t always useful (or even usable), and not always pretty; and that&rsquo;s also not what they&rsquo;re about – but they&rsquo;re vital for opening up new perspectives on what the new medium can do that the old one couldn&rsquo;t; for getting rid of old sludge; for gathering the courage to think afresh.</p>
<p>Out of this courage grows the <em>third phase</em>, which I think we have slowly been sliding into in very recent times. This is about the new medium finding its <em>own</em> language, an æsthetics and functionality that is inherently its own, that has grown from its own capabilities, its advantages and hindrances, its means of production, in dialogue and friction with the tools that shape it. The fruits of this phase aren&rsquo;t just New, they&rsquo;re also Usable, and define themselves somewhat independently from the Old. 
On the technological front, this means new possibilities for example per the OT format; tellingly, the use of OpenType Features has recently become more widespread, but also in a way more subtle, more &ldquo;undercover&rdquo;, subscribing more to usability and usefulness than to extravagance, flashiness and Newness. 
Finally, formally, this beginning third phase is <em>exactly</em> where I, too, would place Legato as a landmark design. It&rsquo;s not the only one, but quite possibly the most significant one. And that is because Legato deconstructs the Old Ways, but not in a destructive way. It deconstructs the Old Ways to find something inherently New that is also ultimately Usable, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s, also in my book, quite possibly the most important typeface so far of the digital era; a digital era that is coming of age, and has largely passed the PoMo tempers of its youth to find its own identity and value.</p>

If you like comparing type to art: How many artists that we think of as significant today weren&rsquo;t recognized in their own time, maybe because they were too &ldquo;new&rdquo;, or maybe because their work didn&rsquo;t make sense to the other practitioners – or maybe because it simply didn&rsquo;t seem all that significant? :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To my eyes, latin type design has been a remarkably conservative art.</p>
<p>The great breakthrough of Jenson and Griffo in the 16th century was only subtly, though decisively different from the scribal hands of the day. The 19th century was perhaps the most innovative period in creating fat faces, clarendon and the sans, and various decorative types. The 20th century seems to me to be a return to conservatism, with the main innovation being the use of sans for text. But otherwise a refinement of Victorian and earlier styles.</p>
<p>There have been stylistic changes right along, in harmony with other movements in the decorative arts, such as architecture and painting. But I don&rsquo;t see anything as innovative as the 19th century.</p>
<p>The main innovation of the film and computer type eras seems to be the production of huge families of closely related sans in multiple widths and weights, such as Univers and many others that have followed. The film and particularly computer era has also allowed the proliferation of script types, used where before hand lettering would have been used.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we are going to have more big innovation, as in the 19th century, but if so I suspect it will come from new technology, such as designing for the screen, and use of open type, as well as the greater cross-cultural currents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly a fan of this conservatism, but neither do I have a big problem with it in the field of type. It does seem to me a reality. The changes in science and society have been much more dramatic over the same period, compared to changes in type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick: Not the lack of popularity, but the lack of designers being inspired is admittedly worrisome. This is something I pointed out during my talk in Mexico City; I&rsquo;m trying hard to encourage people to break the cycle of ideological lethargy. It&rsquo;s not easy - it&rsquo;s notable that I haven&rsquo;t done much with it myself! :-/ So it&rsquo;s not due to a lack of desire - it&rsquo;s due to the great intellectual difficulty it entails. The way we&rsquo;ve been taught to make letters since we start <em>crawling</em> -namely, with skeletons- is very hard to overcome.</p>
<p>Looking at educational institutions is not a good benchmark however; the <em>teachers</em> would have to come from a new generation for us to see any real shift there.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>BTW, when analyzing Legato and its potential relevance, instead of merely focusing on phenomena, one should consider <em>why</em> people think Legato is special, and discuss <em>that</em> (although probably not here). And this is where I frankly don&rsquo;t get how anybody can minimize the relevance of making a clean break from type&rsquo;s misguided &ldquo;painterly&rdquo; past (and really, present).</p>

It&rsquo;s not enough to take the word of a passionate advocate, no matter how well informed.</p>

Evert didn&rsquo;t help his cause by not demonstrating his theory in a more didactic manner.

<p>This is a small, small threadjack, forgive me, but this is such a wonderful contribution altaira, and I want to ask the community:</p>
<p>Has Graphic Design reached this point?</p>
<p>In one of my essays, I&rsquo;m attempting to define Graphic Design as its own medium. As it stands, I have found graphic design to be nothing more than the thoughtful consideration of (the principle) fields of Illustration, Photography, Printmaking, Typography, and Communication brought together in a single object/medium/vehicle.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evert didn’t help his cause by not demonstrating
his theory in a more didactic manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also agreed. He was a timid soul; I&rsquo;ve only heard one story about him getting worked up. But maybe that&rsquo;s what allowed him to focus on the problem and find a solution, instead of preaching it too much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the manner in which the axis of the negative space (counter) outline
is rotated, in relation to the solid outline, is rather fuzzy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This must me some sort of cosmic moment: agreed yet again! As I&rsquo;ve said before -although rarely- Evert was too Modernist in his approach. He didn&rsquo;t learn to &ldquo;let go&rdquo;. Few do. I think the realization that a designer simply cannot control everything is the secret ingredient he had yet to acquire. That said, he had genius in him (and I never use that word lightly). In many ways he reminds me of Dwiggins - who had his own limits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why don’t you design a face which more clearly demonstrates the

<p>This is exactly the sort of thing that takes years to gestate. I&rsquo;ve had almost a decade so far, so I guess I&rsquo;m a sloth. However, when I got back from Mexico City, I was going to sleep every night thinking about what the lc &ldquo;n&rdquo; should really look like. After 4 nights I got something. All I will say here and now is: almost no type designer will accept it.* But I have to find strength in the truth that we don&rsquo;t design type for type designers. If it takes decades for people to &ldquo;get it&rdquo;, so be it.</p>

<li>Unlike Legato, which virtually nobody hates. Which is of itself very impressive - changing the rules completely without turning off users.</li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think admiration counts for much, certainly when one is talking about &ldquo;the most significant font since Gutenburg&rdquo;.
I would expect to see widespread usage, clones, and derivative work.</p>
<p>If these are not forthcoming, and we have to rely on ad hoc &ldquo;admiration&rdquo; expressed in online forums, that may conceivably be used as a measure of success, but it could be better organized, like &ldquo;Top 10 fonts of the decade, as voted for at Typophile.com&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is happy apple-and-orange comparing again. 
Popularity does not define significance. At least not to everyone here.</p>
<p>Echo alone does not define the voice of a design,
and its inner strength.</p>
<p>Legato is too inconspicuous to be picked up by the Horde as the New Hype
(and within just a few years of its creation too). No, not everyone can see it; 
but it moves. And I for one believe that type, like other cultural artefacts, 
can move things, can slowly transform preconceptions, also moving below 
the surface. I believe Legato has the power to do that. Not on its own; but it is 
a major piece in the puzzle.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>BTW, if your idea of a Top 10 List that makes sense is just to pick the 10 most popular and widespread faces, that&rsquo;s not hard to do at all – go ahead. It&rsquo;s just much less interesting.
And sorry to do this, but it really is &ldquo;Gutenberg&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to Kris Sowersby&rsquo;s Karbon as being a good type influenced by Legato, but without adopting its &lsquo;opposite twist&rsquo; idea.</p>
<p>But I see that in its nearly finished state, Karbon shows less influence of Legato than it did at first, at least to my eyes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shouldn’t something that is to be considered “most”
significant require mainstream recognition?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>After <em>decades</em>, rarely after 5 years, especially when it comes to such an obscure field as type.</li>
<li><em>Only</em> to the degree that people bring it up and discuss it.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, everybody knows that sometimes a great idea never makes it. Humanity errs.</p>
<p>Conditional? I don&rsquo;t get it. I believe it is the most significant font (which is not to say it&rsquo;s more significant than all other fonts combined, or even a select group of fonts combined - simply that no other <em>single</em> font is as significant) so naturally I believe it will most probably affect the future. I think the problem here isn&rsquo;t what I believe, but simply the fact that: Legato&rsquo;s claim to fame is functional, and your world revolves around style; and you don&rsquo;t seem to like singularities - you like everything to make nice sense in a cultural continuum. But revolutions happen.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>BTW, I wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything (at least not in that other thread) but you owe Nina a follow-up on your inquisition about her actually using Legato for real work. Not that you <em>must</em> use something to see it significance.</p>

<p>Nick, maybe my «Popularity does not define significance» wasn&rsquo;t concisely worded. What I meant – and still think – is that you trust the marketplace too much in determining what can possibly be of significance. No, I do not believe in the mainstream crowning Significance Queens. Actually I believe the mainstream is very often particularly obsessed with very insignificant things. 
We have different levels of trust in the masses, and we have different definitions of significance. But I&rsquo;ve said that before.</p>
<p>And while I wouldn&rsquo;t have said you «owe» me a follow-up, I would certainly be curious what the point of your enquiry was. It appears that you like to stress that in your opinion, even people who love Legato don&rsquo;t use it enough; I do, now what?</p>

<p>I think this populism is a front; in fact the masses are being used as a &ldquo;human shield&rdquo; of sorts. I believe the root problem is the desire to defend a form-motivated creative pleasure from intrusion by other people&rsquo;s functional needs; nevermind that these are the very people paying for the goods. Art versus Design.</p>

<p>Of course there have. But of the ones that <em>have</em> resulted in all that, have they done it in 5 years? Anyway what would be the point of answering that question for you, when all you&rsquo;d say is something like: &ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;re wrong about it having been significant since it didn&rsquo;t become popular!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no point really.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People (readers and typographers) should decide for themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what readers* are good at. They&rsquo;re good at cooking, counting, driving, whatever. Some of them know how to design a car engine, and the rest of us who don&rsquo;t know much about engines appreciate them for it without having any idea how they might do their job better. You might notice or not that your car engine has lower mpg than you suspect it should, but beyond that you&rsquo;re pretty clueless, and largely powerless. But the engine might in fact suffer from poor design, and <em>still</em> end up in cars, and get great reviews in stupid car magazines!</p>
<ul>
<li>And too many graphic designers (a <em>typographer</em> is quite a rara avis) aren&rsquo;t good at that either!  :-/</li>
</ul>
<p>You might cajole people by telling them they&rsquo;re in total control of themselves and they have within their minds everything they need, but to me that&rsquo;s deluded, and potentially unethical.</p>
<p>Crackpot theory? Saying that there&rsquo;s more to quality than popularity is a crackpot theory? And are you pretending I&rsquo;m the only one saying that?</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>And again: Could you please follow-up on your inquisition of Nina concerning actual use of Legato?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No offense Nick, but you <em>do</em> seem defensive.</p>
<p>Let me try to reiterate. When Hrant made that statement about Legato, surely he didn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;significance&rdquo; in terms of immediate impact, or sales; but <em>conceptual</em> significance (that in this case goes unnoticed quite easily), because it does something New where almost everybody else follows the Old. That&rsquo;s defining significance on a conceptual, on a theoretical level, and possibly on a practical level too (although I can&rsquo;t claim to quite grasp that part).
You, on the other hand, list criteria of popularity, usage, and impact on other designs. And I think that this definition, this list of criteria to determine what is significant and what isn&rsquo;t, places too much trust in what people-at-large (ie the mainstream, ie the market) think is significant. I believe something can be conceptually/culturally significant without the general public (which can also mean graphic designers at large) &ldquo;getting&rdquo; it. Maybe because it&rsquo;s too early, maybe because (as Hrant said) people err. And large crowds of people can err, too.
Like I said: We have different definitions of what &ldquo;significant&rdquo; means.</p>
<p><cite>&quot;- it’s too soon to say.&quot;</cite>
Wait – you say it&rsquo;s too soon to say that it&rsquo;s significant, 
but it&rsquo;s not too soon to say that it isn&rsquo;t? :-\</p>

If we define &ldquo;Significant&rdquo; as having had an impact on typography we get a different set of fonts than those we might say &ldquo;had a positive impact on the effectiveness of type design&rdquo;.
I would count Univers as having a significant impact because it brought about a much more systematic way of approaching type families that  has been emulated frequently. I don&rsquo;t mean the numbering system, I mean the design approach and being a sans is not the issue.</p>
