  City\". This is a documentary film made in 1927 by Walter Ruttmann. I'm working
  on a video-art project with reference to the film. Any idea how to find such a font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font1_4738.jpg]"

  body: "The usual practice of the era was to hand letter movie titles, sometimes
    with care so repeating letters look the same. \r\nThis lettering is an Art Nouveau
    style of the early 20th century.\r\nIt was sometimes made into fonts. For example
    Bohemian in the Miller and Richard Type Foundry of London and Edinburgh specimen
    book, digitized by Nick Curtis as Millrich Moravian NF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/millrich-moravian-nf/\r\nIt
    was also used on buildings. For example on the Kumla Skofabrik in Sweden cira
    1920. Digitized by G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m as Kumla http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/autodidakt/kumla/\r\nThere
    are also some similarities to the ATF Thermotype circa 1930 digitized by Nick
    Curtis as Deux Chasses NF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/deux-chasses-nf/\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
