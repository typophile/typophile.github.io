  HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/trends.gif" TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/trends.gif</A>
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s from page 195 of &#34;The shaping of our alphabet&#34; by Frank
  Denman &#40;Knopf, 1955&#41;. The chapter home to the graph &#40;#12, &#34;Where
  do we go from here?&#34;&#41; is actually a riveting read itself, and contains a
  completely unexpected and very eloquent defense of... alphabet reform! I tell you,
  the things one finds by mistake. <BR> <BR>Anyway, rather than offer my interpretations
  of the graph, <BR>I&#39;d like to stay quiet and hear of the things you see in it.

    today might look. '

    For each &#34;row&#34; the first hill is the main movement, the second is a revival.
    Note that this thing seems to be &#34;pseudo-quantitive&#34;: it&#39;s not based
    strictly on numbers &#40;as the author admits&#41;, but it does contain views
    of certain specific things. For example, note the little wobble in the descent
    of the revival of &#34;Victorian Bizarre&#34;. Also, the hills don&#39;t seem
    to be to relative scale. For example, the peak of &#34;Modern&#34; should be much
    higher than that of &#34;Caslon&#34; &#40;considering the greater use of type
    200 years later&#41;, but it&#39;s all been normalized instead. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    love to have a graph that extends to today. But I&#39;m not remotely qualified
    to make it, especially since I have a feeling it starts getting really messy in
    the past 20 years. <BR> <BR>So, what do you guys think about: <BR>1. The &#91;supposed&#93;
    regularity of the main trends. <BR>2. The timing of the revival hills. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' The thing with the graph is that it doesn&#39;t have to be &#40;and maybe
    even shouldn&#39;t be&#41; strictly quantitative to be useful. Note how it&#39;s
    showing classes of fonts, not individual designs - and that&#39;s a good thing.
    So the hard numbers would undoubtedly help, but it would take the analysis and
    insight of a real guru to &#34;distill&#34; it into something really useful. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe we can build a foundation here, with this small seed question: what
    are the main style categories since the 1950s? I&#39;m thinking of stuff like
    &#34;American Grotesk&#34; &#40;Franklin Gothic&#41; or &#34;Humanist Sans&#34;
    &#40;Syntax&#41; or &#34;Aldine Revival&#34; &#40;JY Aetna&#41;, etc. BTW, even
    just determining the optimal level-of-detail on this thing is an issue of itself...
    <BR> <BR>Also, maybe we&#39;re getting ahead of ourselves: Is Denman&#39;s graph
    even a solid foundation to build from? Franklin Gothic, for example, isn&#39;t
    represented... <BR> <BR>hhp '
