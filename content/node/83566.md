body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCan someone name this?\r\n\r\nIt's very close to Helvetica, but
  the uppercase G is similar to the one in Akzidenz Grotesk, the 'a' is a little different,
  and the \xC5 is different in that the circle touches the rest of the letter.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a link: http://www.b14cms.dk/users/koes.dk/www/files/pdf/Walk_this_way_folder.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  can't find a specimen of Neue Hass grotesk to see if it has an alternative uppercase
  'G' like this, but I don't think so."
