  it in the glyphs window in Illustrator, my alternate glyphs appears one after an
  other. But when I use some other fonts, a menu appears when alternative glyphs are
  available.\r\nI don't really understand what I am doing wrong. Is it some kind of
  opentype feature that I am not doing right in Fontlab ? Any help would be much appreciate
  :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/menu_5693.jpg]"

    This should be present if you want alternates to be presented in the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
