    I can't find Charmed anywhere. Can you help me find someplace where I can download

  body: "I still think it's parent is Rockwell light.  The arch of the n and m \r\nisn't
    rounded as in Beton or Serifa. The bowl of the a is identical.\r\nThe y and I
    are the easiest to modify.\r\n\r\nThis font takes about 15 mins to replicate using
    Rockwell light\r\nand deleting some points here and there "

  body: I think you're right. It's probably Rockwell in my original picture modified
    the same way you did. Even though Nilland is the font I've been looking for. No
    need for modification.
