  two: one from the last five years or so, and one older than that, preferably 10

    Gill &#40;1929 ish&#41; <BR> <BR>I notice that Gill Sans turned up in the most
    overused font thread too.  Whenever I see anything trying to evoke a 1930s feel
    &#40;which is quite a lot at the moment&#41;, they always use a font with Deco
    in its name.  Some of these fonts are nice, but they&#39;re much less common in
    real objects from the 30&#39;s than you would think.  From 1935 Gill Sans was
    used for the Penguin book covers which epitomise good quality 1930&#39;s design
    and &#40;because they were in every house right up to recent years&#41; really
    bring out that time period in the mind of almost everyone over 20. &#40;In the
    UK at least - don&#39;t know if they are the same in the US&#41;. <BR>  <BR>

  body: Vectora is around here in the States, in certain pockets of use. It was used
    to great effect for a few years in <i>Critique</i> magazine, where I was first
    introduced to it. I used it extensively in the program guide for a yoga/wellness
    center several years ago, shortly after which, it was picked up by Yoga Journal
    &#40;I like to think my use influenced them, though it may have just been coincidence&#41;.
    I seem to remember seeing it picked up in another, more mainstream magazine recently,
    but I can&#39;t recall which offhand. <BR> <BR>There are a handful of books in
    production for the publisher I work with which are using Vectora as the sans-serif
    for secondary elements. <BR> <BR>But, thankfully, it is far from overexposed.
    It&#39;s a great face, very sturdy and serviceable. The one drawback is that the
    excessive x-height can make it tricky to mix with other faces. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    <BR>What do you mean? You can order their stuff on their web sites. And when I
    asked for the A3 sheet on Trinite, they mailed it to me with a gracious note in
    the elegant hand of PMN.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t understand how the high prices
    make economic sense. I would think that you are going to make more money from
    selling to a lot of small users than a few sales to corporations or magazines
    who will use it a lot more, but buy it only once.  <BR>'

  body: 'My information might be outdated. It had something to do with -intentionally-
    not having a representative in the US. As for getting specimens, TEFF&#42; is
    indeed highly gracious. Did you notice the paper they use for the specimens? Wow.
    But note that I said &#34;and/or&#34;. I remembered at least <i>one</i> of them
    not selling [directly] to the US - it could have been DTL and not TEFF. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    And DTL provides all you need in PDFs online. <BR> <BR>&#62; intention <BR> <BR>I
    can&#39;t be sure, but maybe it has to do with higher rates of piracy and/or lack
    of copyright protection. Basically it&#39;s a matter of <i>controlling</i> the
    dissemination of your product, and that goes hand in hand with: <BR> <BR>&#62;
    I don&#39;t understand how the high prices make economic sense. <BR> <BR>Well,
    the price point of something depends on many things, and in a niche market for
    example higher prices will yield greater profits. I think in this case higher
    prices do two things: elevate the prestige of the foundry above the seething masses,
    &#34;justifying&#34; future [high] pricing; reduce the rate of piracy &#40;not
    just by reducing dissemination, but also because the more you pay for something
    the less likely you&#39;ll share it&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>A long while back DTL was represented in the US by Monotype.
    There was also another distributor either before or after Monotype. I think URW&#43;&#43;
    has some current connection with DTL. They are, at any point, selling the DTL
    font creation software. <BR> <BR>

    in 1996. <i>X-Height</i> Vol. 5 no. 1  shows an offering of the DTL fonts, but
    the prices are not given. I don&#39;t know which side ended the arrangement. <BR>

    back in 1996.&#34; <BR> <BR>Interesting. DTL must have been a bit problematic
    but this would seem to indicate that they hardly &#34;intentionally&#34; avoided
    US distribution. I checked my DTL fonts, and five of them, marked 1994 indicate
    receipt from Monotype Typography, and two more, marked 1995 seemingly came from
    the old URW. These were sent for review and I remember having trouble at the time
    because I could not get any literature on them that was written in English. Monotype
    didn&#39;t provide any and I can&#39;t read Dutch. And DTL would not respond to
    my inguiries.'

  body: 'I do find it weird, given the great quality of their types, that DTL doesn&#39;t
    use any other European language in the web site &#40;except for the &#39;shop&#39;.&#41;
    I could manage with French or German, and of course English, but who knows Dutch
    except the Dutch?  <BR> <BR>Also, they have promised a digital version of Romulus
    - the most beautiful roman typeface ever IMHO - in a few months hence for over
    two years. That I can easily understand. It&#39;s the pricing I don&#39;t. If
    there are any Dutch readers of this who actually know the Dutch thinking - and
    it seems to be all Dutch foundries - about this, I would be interested to hear. '

  body: I believe the thinking is that they sell fonts in the Netherlands to people
    who are willing to pay real money for fonts and want to use Dutch ones. Having
    spent some time browsing in Dutch bookshops, I realised just how few non-Dutch
    fonts are widely used in the Netherlands. It&#39;s quite refreshing.

    They push Coster as the inventor of typography instead of Gutenberg &#40;as if
    the Far East is all mere legend anyway...&#41;, they insist blackletter is not
    German, what next?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
