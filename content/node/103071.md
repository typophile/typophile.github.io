    be a match to No. 97 from the Hamilton type company.\r\n\r\nLink I have on file
    for the source of the image, Hamilton catalog 14, is: \r\nhttp://www.unicorngraphics.com/wood%20type%20museum.asp\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    the link did not work when I tried it a few minutes ago.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/No97HamiltonCatalog14_4182.jpg]\r\n\r\nDon"

    body: "I didn't know that woodtype was usually sold by number, some interesting.\r\n\r\nThat
      type looks really similar, but it's no the same. Compare, for example, the glyphs
      S, M or C.\r\nAny way, thank you so much, Don!"
