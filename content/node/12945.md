  body: "Do a search for \"wood type\" on myfonts.com. Here are a few other ideas
    (sorry but don't have time to link these):\r\n- Rosewood (Adobe) although it's
    overused it's still great\r\n- Brothers or Council (Emigre)\r\n- Egyptienne Condensed\r\n-
    good 'ol Clarendon\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that when you say \"country\" it could
    mean a lot of things. There's a big difference between Hank Williams (classic
    country) and Shania Twain (contemporary). I'm blowing hot air a bit here since
    I don't listen to, or care for country music. I do however live in Nashville.
    Good luck."

  body: 'I dunno if I totally agree with using wood type. Seems to me that unless
    the musician is absolutely old school country and has not desire to be current
    you will be better served by in the very least taking a few steps left or right
    of the obvious. '

  body: "It can go either way. I did a piece for Vince Gill and he hated the obvious
    choices: Rosewood, etc\u2026 He ended up wanting a nice serif. I recently did
    a piece for Tracy Byrd and it was filled with the Rosewoods of this world. So
    it really depends on the artist and what they want to represent themselves as\u2026\r\npeace"
