body: We &#40;Outside magazine&#41; are trying to find a new serif body copy font.
  Minion has crossed our radar but how can I possibly find out who else is using it?
  I called Adobe but the guy I talked to seemed unable/unwilling to help...

    <BR>Instead of the more tired than tried Minion, you can surely find something
    better. <BR> <BR>Tell us more about your magazine: <BR>-The general style, including
    a titling font you might have settled on. <BR>-What&#39;s it about? Who is it
    for? <BR>-How long are the articles? <BR>-What are the illustrations/photos like?
    <BR>-How much of a design statement would you like it to make, versus serving
    the reader directly? <BR>etc. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>Unless you were lucky enough to reach someone in the Adobe font group, a general
    sales guy would be unlikely to reel off a list of high-profile publishers/magazines
    using the font. You might be better off looking at the work of smaller vendors
    or independent type designers who can provide a more personal level of pre-sales
    support. <BR> <BR>Si'

  body: Outside is a monthly outdoor/adventure/men&#39;s magazine published out of
    Santa Fe. If you go to SPD.org you might find some spreads of ours; we won Silver
    Medal for magazine of the year last year &#40;ha! and yet here I am asking about
    Minion, hm?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The photos and illos are usually pretty nice &#40;illos
    by the Clayton Bros, Brian Cronin, Zohar Lazar, etc., photos by James Nachtwey,
    Anton Corbijn, Jake Chessum, etc.&#41; . <BR>I think the main thing is that our
    creative director would like to make a departure from the body copy font that
    she had to inherit when she arrived at the magazine. Right now we&#39;re using
    Caslon224 Book. Yeek. The other fonts we use mainly are Interstate, Giza and BigCaslon
    for display.  <BR> <BR>I also thought that maybe Miller &#40;Font Bureau&#41;
    would work well as a new serif?

  body: Jana -- OUTSIDE is too interesting for Minion. Interesting in a bold, graphic,
    appealing sort of way. I&#39;m not an outdoorsy type, but I still find myself
    looking at the mag when I&#39;m in Border&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Miller is wonderful.
    And as a bonus you can license the display and text versions when you feel like
    splashing out with larger serifs. I also think it flows well with Big Caslon.
    Or if you want something a little more understated you might look at Whitman &#40;also
    from Font Bureau&#41;. Both have OsF and smallcaps and all the requisite goodies.
    <BR> <BR>Another idea, perhaps a little more similar to Minion, but more interesting
    IMO, would be <a href="http://bitstream.com/categories/products/nfc/iowan_complete/iowan_complete.html"
    target="_blank">Iowan Oldstyle</a> ... again all the goodies. <BR> <BR>Or, if
    you want a little more flavor than Minion, something truly French, you might try

    Oldstyle, Whitman and Miller are all great choices. I think Le Monde Journal is
    perhaps a little too refined for this usage &#40;an objection that could also

    the magazine&#39;s design over the years. <BR> <BR>Tiffany&#39;s call for Enigma
    is a good one. Pick up a copy of <i>Details</i> <BR>for an example of how well
    it works. <BR> <BR>I think another interesting choice was <i>Wallpaper</i>&#39;s
    use of <BR>Plantin Schoolbook. Plantin is a proven long-reading face, but <BR>the
    &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39; variants of the Schoolbook version lent a distinctive
    <BR>quality without being overbearing. Not sure if they&#39;re still using <BR>it
    because I haven&#39;t seen <i>Wallpaper</i> in a while, but <a href="http://typographi.ca/000490.php"

    none of these have the condensed quality of Minion, <BR>but I think condensed
    is overrated for a text face. Instead, use a <BR>smaller point with generous leading.

    I respectfully disagree with Hrant and Thomas about Chapparal. I find it unattractive,
    mannered and dark en masse -- look at an old issue of Adobe magazine before it
    died to see Chapparal used as a text face. &#40;Ick.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;d second
    &#40;or third?&#41; the recommendation of Miller. It&#39;s plainspokenness would
    be an asset with all of the other faces &#40;and expressive headline typography&#41;
    that Outside uses. You don&#39;t need yet another face saying &#34;look at me!&#34;

    <BR> <BR>Oh, I so wish there was a sans version of ITC Garamond, which we could
    set at 14 point in long lines, with big word spaces, negative leading and &#43;25

    some cultural justification for using a sans in a magazine... although it certainly

  body: It depends on how you define &#34;immersive reading&#34;. Larson&#39;s parallel-letterwise
    model is inherently limited in terms of how deep into immersion it can go. Any
    act of reading that doesn&#39;t use boumas can&#39;t be said to be fully immersive.
    For an adult reader, the only thing &#34;below&#34; parallel-letterwise reading
    is sequential-letterwise reading, and since adults are proficient in parallelism,
    it actually takes an extra effort to read sequentially - so the immersive threshold
    for adults is between letterwise and bouma, not sequential and parallel. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I have spent plenty of time learning not only what Larson said, but also
    reading up on almost all his references. Anyway, there will be a round table discussion
    in Thessaloniki in a month &#40;with John Hudson moderating, so I&#39;m already

    way, because there&#39;s a lot going on anyway. <BR> <BR>So I might suggest these
    ideas: <BR>-Do try Chaparral. Coupled to that charming fat Egyptian for subheads,
    I think it might sing sing sing. <BR>-Consider dumping Interstate. As a sub, try
    to find a sans that matches Chaparral. Like what? <BR> <BR>I think the highly
    &#34;talkative&#34; layout needs a somewhat more focused base to really work optimally,
    and reducing the number of fonts &#40;which is not the same thing as taming all
    the fonts&#41; might really click. On the other hand, no magazine I&#39;ve designed
    has won an award. My defence here is that I&#39;ve never designed a magazine.
