Right now I'm down to these two versions.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pleppo_v1_5825.jpg]


The first one is an old tv/robot that refers to the fact that they are into media. The second one is some kind of robot toy with it's brains showing. This is the idea that they suggested in our first meeting, that they wanted something with a wind-up brain. I have the wind-up key in both version to suggested screwed up or screwed ideas, their show contains very random humour and is relatively extrem, that's also why I have the pink/brown colour scheme.

I'm concerned about the brain on the second one. I think that people might not get that it is a brain.

If you have any opinions, good or bad, feel free to comment.

		<div class="commentbody">Peter,

i like both of them - nice ideas & quirky color scheme.

With the first one being slightly stronger, but also more obvious. The second one could benefit from the brain being more divided (left/right brain side). Have a look at some standard brain illustrations to see what i mean.

Looking forward to seeing the final artwork.

The next idea I had was actually to put the brain in the TV like Jay suggests. Didin't work as I would've hoped. It would have been a nice combination.

I've made the brain a little brainer by dividing it in the middle like a real brain is.

I really like the TV, like Seb said it feels stronger. But the brain idea is still pretty funny and quirky so I'm going to try and take it in a direction where I can have both.</div>

I think if you haven't, looking at brains for real would help. your brains right now read more like food, something delicious to eat. Its mostly about how swirly and pointed the ends of your lines get. Right now the third one is working the best for me.</div>

Even though I like the simple tv-only logo better I think it's better to go with brain-tv logo because the first one in its simplistic version has been used by others already.

		<div class="commentbody">Decided to go with the tv/brain combo. This is the finished version of that. The client likes the this version.

The very first idea they had was just a brain with a wind-up key in it. Going to try and make a version with that later although I don't think it will mount to much.

This dosen't have to be finished for another month so I can still make a lot of changes.

Thanks for all the feedback so far.

A smile might be to cute but I'll have to try it and see what it looks like.

One of them showed it to his mother and she thought it looked like a bowl of popcorn. I thought that was pretty funny :)

Bit late now but I preferred the brain in a bowl toy.

Beautiful project from beginning to end. Every concept was well-executed and the final product beautifully incorporated the best of the concepts developed and feedback provided in between. Such a fun and well-thought-out logo. It was a pleasure to read and look at this thread. Thanks for sharing!

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Courtney:</em> Thanks. On the site you can find it in the loading bar(s), on the wall above the tv and at the end of some of the video clips. The logo will also be on the t-shirts and other products when the Shop opens.

<em>Therese:</em> This is what they wanted. The name Pleppo is also very well known among it's target audience and dosen't need that much logo or name branding. There are several commercial campaings going on that promote the site though. The site itself dosen't need to show the name or logo as freaquent as other sites usually do, it's not directly an ordinary company.

<em>Michael:</em> Thanks. It's a pleasure to post projects on this site when you know you'll get some decent feedback.</div>
