  typeface identifiers please help me out with which typeface this is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/batmanbbtext_6500.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  the title/subtitle for the latest Batman kids' cartoon. The style and content of
  the show is loosely based on a run of comics from the 40's/50's (I think?) which
  featured the same name. I mention that in case it can help identify this one.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance! :D"
