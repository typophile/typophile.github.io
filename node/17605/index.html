		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, jobbing work typically implies quick turn around work, often one-off for a client you may never see again. Print shops that offer &lsquo;design services&rsquo; are engaged in jobbing work, but it also happens in the freelance world. If someone phones you up and says &lsquo;I need a business card design for a start-up company and I have a meeting with potential investors tomorrow morning&rsquo;, that would constitute jobbing work. So to some degree it is defined by the amount of time and creativity you can afford to apply to the job.</p>
<p>It happens in the type design field as well. Everyone once in a while I get a phonecall or email from someone who e.g. has a custom font that they have made themselves or someone has made for them, and they want to know why it looks like poo and whether I can do anything about it. Often the work is largely technical, e.g. fixing hinting or vertical metrics, but sometimes it involves adding new glyphs to existing fonts, which can be a challenge if the existing design is really bad: how you you achieve consistency? Sometimes these jobs turn into long term projects, with entire typefaces ending up being redesigned, but sometimes they arrive on a Friday and are gone on a Monday and the only further contact is when the cheque arrives. I tend to think of jobbing work as beer money.</p>
