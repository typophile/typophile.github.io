ERROR: There was a problem while compiling OpenType font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition for errors</code>

Once more I am confronted with an error in FontLab, which I don’t entirely understand. Especially the help suggestion is entirely useless. I understand the issue is caused by “multiple glyphs” with the unicode 2126, but how do I find, identify and eliminate the duplicate entry if it isn’t showing up in the glyphs list? How do I know which is the right associated character, which is the original and which the duplicate?

I love some features of FontLab, but its approach and mysterious ways are really frustrating sometimes. It shows that this software is quite old, compared to modern applications. Glyphs, a relatively new app, shows promise, but I can’t justify to dash out another $329. Designing fonts is a passion of mine and I understand virtually no one can live from it (except maybe H&FJ and a few others)…

If you know a solution to my second FontLab error I cannot fix alone, please let me know.</div>

I was thinking the exact same thing. I just stumbled upon the thread about the progress on FontLab 6, because frankly FontLab Studio 5 is too confusing. I have a tremendous amount to learn about FontLab still anyway so it's not strange I run into problems, but I'm also thinking perhaps it's not so wise to invest my time in trying to figure this software out if FontLab 6 is on the way. I tried Glyphs but it doesn't quite provide me with what I want. A new FontLab is really what I would prefer, but perhaps that's just due to previous experience and I need to force myself to learn new software.

Anyway, I apologize for coming to a different thread with my own issues, but I was wondering if you guys could help me out with what seems to be a problem which is easy enough to fix for someone with more experience with the software and/or scripting. Here's the thread explaining my problem: [[http://typophile.com/node/114295]]

Normally I would just wait for someone to respond, but I need to have 2 basic fonts roughly done by Friday and I'm afraid to start working on the second font until this issue in the first one is solved. I was going to use the metrics and script of the first font to develop the second one. I can't generate an OTF file until the problem in the script is resolved.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the main font window, you can simply search (Cmd/Ctrl-F) for any glyph by either name or codepoint. So it should have been easy to find those two particular glyphs sharing the one Unicode codepoint. Or am I missing something?

Of course, those of us who routinely work on fonts with 1000+ glyphs use the search functions a lot. Also the custom encoding view.</div>

If you have removed the glyphs, they could still be referenced by:
- OpenType feature code
- kerning
- class definitions</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In FontLab, go to windows > panels > classes. Anything there? If there is, even though you don't use it now, Font Lab expects it and will give you an error message. You can't just whisper your intentions in it's ear, you know. (Well you can, but your success rate is going to be <cite>really</cite> low...)

You'll have to tidy up your classes. Easiest way, as I said in the build forum, is to set things so the classes are a part of the features, write off the features to a simple text file, and check that everything there is still valid. Next, clear both the classes and features in the FontLab file, then read the features back in, and compile.

Or tidy things up in the FontLab (file) itself.
