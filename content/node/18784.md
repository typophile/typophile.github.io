body: "In case anyone here has never purchased a Stormtype font, then there is a good
  chance you have never seem his catalog. It can be purchased, but it is free with
  the purchase of any font. An example all foundries would do well to examine. \r\n\r\nThe
  Pennysaver (a weekly newsprint publication for selling junk) outshines some foundry
  catalogs (at least it looks like The Pennysaver has had some printing experience),
  but Stormtype's is a visual feast, and the .pdf file does not compare in the least.
  Looking at the .pdf is what reminded me.\r\n\r\n\r\n(note: I am not affiliated with
  Stormtype, I just get jazzed with unexpected quality)"

  body: i'm rather proud of <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/catalog.html">our
    last catalog</a> for P22. Not quite as expansive as the storm catalog, but just
    as pleasing to hold and to look at.

    or a t-shirt.
