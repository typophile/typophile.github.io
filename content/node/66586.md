  infiltrating this site. Retaining the current system guarantees more spam. Something
  <em>has</em> to be done, and the MetaFilter system is proven to work."

    It is gone now. I think this minimum obstacle should be reintroduced."

  body: "Spammers can handle CAPTCHAs quite well, Florian. It won\u2019t solve the
    problem. Nor do I buy the idea that we\u2019re just dealing with a couple of bad
    apples. Spam appears here on a weekly basis, or (let\u2019s say) every 10 days.\r\n\r\nAnother
    advantage of constrained new memberships is it requires administrators to actually
    tend to the site, instead of letting spammers sign up and, one minute later, post
    unsolicited commercial messages to the site, which admins can take days to notice.
    Constrained memberships force admins to actually administer instead of being absentee
    landlords."

  body: The spammers are problematic, obviously, but I honestly don't know if constrained
    membership is the solution. It's possible that it works, but on the other hand
    it's also very possible you end up with a forum where hardly any new people are
    being introduced. Then it'll be a secluded elite clique. I don't think that is
    desired. It's probably better to try and see what happens if you install every
    method of countering bot-registrations - make it as difficult as possible - like
    CAPTCHA, e-mail verification, and so forth. I'm quite sure that Joe is right when
    he says some spammers can circumvent these precautions, but also that it will
    become too much of a hassle for spammers to continue?

  body: "> Spammers can handle CAPTCHAs quite well\r\n\r\nThat's absolutely not true
    (you must have something against captchas for some other -probably pointless-
    reason). If it were true, hundreds of high-end sites would not be relying so heavily
    on it. I've only seen one trick that tries to get around captchas - it was very
    devious, but has now disappeared, surely for good reason (probably because a captcha-using
    site can simply stop allowing an image referral on a captcha).\r\n\r\nHaving a
    captcha for creating an account is a good -and sufficient- idea.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a different definition of \u201Ce-mail
    verification,\u201D but Typophile currently requires a valid e-mail upon sign-up,
    where it then sends an automated message with a random password for first-time
    log-ons.\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed (in the course of janitorial service) is
    that a lot of spammers use disposable e-mail services like yopmail and mailinator
    to get through that barrier. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if that sort of e-mail
    thing is automate-able for a spam-bot. If not, then there are real people spamming
    the system. In which case, a CAPTCHA will do little good.\r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand, adding a CAPTCHA probably couldn\u2019t hurt. \r\n\r\n"

  body: 'kentlew: I have no idea if bots can ''use'' an e-mail verification system
    (or.. well, I wouldn''t be surprised if they can). But if they are human spammers,
    adding CAPTCHA just adds one more step they have to go through. I doubt they are
    human spammers, but if they are, then adding another step might make signing up
    just for spamming too much of a hassle.'
