  body: 'What is this logo for? <BR> <BR>My initial reaction is that there is not
    enough contrast between &#34;adora&#34; and &#34;media&#34; -- perhaps smaller
    all caps or a different font all together for &#34;media&#34; would work better.
    <BR> <BR>The possiblities for colors would change with adjustments to your current
    typesetting. '

  body: can you drop &#39;media&#39; altogether? &#39;adora&#39; is quite nice. &#39;media&#39;
    just seems to be distracting us from the &#39;adora&#39;. <BR> <BR>Maybe keep
    the spacing for media, but use small-caps and make them about half the size they
    are now.

  body: I agree with darrel.  those are nice letterforms by themselves.  if you must
    keep media, use something smallcaps/sans
