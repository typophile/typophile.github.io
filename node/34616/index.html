<p>How can you be sceptical? I am not too sure what you mean by mechanics, but I&rsquo;ll try to explain. Christian proposed the idea of working together on Meta Serif, and I agreed. He had Erik&rsquo;s blessing to go ahead. I think Christian did the first sketches (in Fontlab) and gave the file to me, it was passed back and forth until we were both happy with it. Then, based on the Roman, I proceeded to flesh out the italic &amp; blacks, with Christian marking the proof .pdf&rsquo;s and sometimes tweaking the .vfb&rsquo;s if the changes were minute. All the way along Erik is asked to check to make sure he is happy with how it is looking, and also makes suggestions.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, it is a truly collaborative approach. I have to admit it is much easier than trying to make a typeface solo, as certain decisions are made more much quickly!</p>
<p>Is that what you mean by mechanics?</p>

You could probably add a few more to that list like House, Quay+Sack, RXC &amp; PSY/OPS designers, and Underware. But it&rsquo;s certainly not the norm.

And what about Edward Hoffmann, who basically designed Helvetica through Max Miedenger&rsquo;s hands? I would say that most major releases are via collaboration, one way or another.</p>

<p>I can see what you&rsquo;re getting at, but I think you&rsquo;re over-playing the nature of collaboration in type design. Maybe we need to dissect the mechanics to get a better grasp of what tasks can and cannot be shared? For example, Gill used to draw the letters then leave the spacing to the Monotype &ldquo;boys&rdquo;. Is this OK?</p>

<p>I like it because two minds are much better than one! Decisions are easier to make, mistakes are picked up by the other, the revolving set of fresh eyes is hugely beneficial.

<p>Kris is being overly modest here, but I&rsquo;ll go back to the beginning first. The idea of Meta Serif has been floating around since 2002 or so, and after a several false starts, Erik and I finally figured out the basic look for the Roman at ATypI last fall. I forget how Kris and I first got in touch with each other, but we had worked together on a few small things and gotten to know each other when I asked him to draw Meta Serif with me. I don&rsquo;t remember the specific circumstances, I just had a gut feeling that it would work out. I thought there was a good chance the typeface would turn out better and be finished faster if we drew it together. He thought I was joking at first, but the rest will be history soon enough.</p>
<p>I probably could have drawn the family myself (even that would have been a collaboration between me and Erik), but Kris brings his own sensibility to the mix, and he&rsquo;s doing a lot more than translating the basic design into a full family - he&rsquo;s really helped to shape the design. To be honest, the trickiest part is managing the files and knowing what the most current version is at any given moment, not working together. In the end, it won&rsquo;t be what he or I or Erik would have done on our own.</p>
<p>It was a similar scenario with Guardian Egyptian, Guardian Sans, Publico, and the other projects Paul Barnes and I have worked on together - I don&rsquo;t think he or I would have come up with any of these typefaces on our own, but together the work (sometimes quickly, sometimes eventually) came pretty naturally. When Paul and I work together, the division of labor is really unclear. One or both of us draws some characters, then we pass files back and forth until we&rsquo;re both happy with what we&rsquo;ve got. Then one of us does the kerning, and I generally do the Superpolating. Not a very exciting story, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>A shared design sensiblity is important for collaboration, but I think the rest is just chemistry. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been pretty lucky in finding people to work with, and have various projects in the works with Kris, Erik, Paul, and others right now, plus a few things of my own. I think it keeps my work fresh, and each of my collaborators knows things that I don&rsquo;t, which keeps things interesting.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I usually do everything myself these days, but I have had some help recently mastering files prior to release, and worked with Alexey Lisovsky on a Cyrillic version of Handsome. Well, he did all the work actually, I art directed and provided some technical help. Of course, a little bit of art direction can go a long way, as the proverbial sketch on the table napkin demonstrates.</p>
<p>My retail fonts have no outside input, which is fine by me, that&rsquo;s the main reason I started the foundry. But it&rsquo;s also very valuable to get direction in commissioned work, whether it&rsquo;s from a client who is a designer/art director, or &ldquo;just&rdquo; a client. For instance, many times I&rsquo;ve prepared alternate directions for a project, and the client has picked what at the time I considered the least promising option. And then it was a struggle to develop it into something that pleased the client <em>and</em> myself. But often, despite the headaches, that produces the most interesting results.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Concerning the Gill angle, the obvious problem is that the intent and planning of good notan is very hard to convey from one person to another, and I have to think Gill and the Monotype boys attempted no such thing; and I hope we agree that the White is Important. The interesting, and quite broad and deep, question here is: if you&rsquo;re making a &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; Latin text face, are the norms of what instances of letterspacing &ldquo;simply work&rdquo; perhaps reliable enough not to require any discussion beyond things like &ldquo;I think it should be looser&rdquo;? I would have to say that from where I stand, perhaps yes, but then &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; becomes quite distant from &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;; and when Kris says &ldquo;it gets the job done&rdquo;, that raises a red flag for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the revolving set of fresh eyes is hugely beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree fully. When you&rsquo;re too close to something it&rsquo;s hard to see it clearly (like how one typically sees many things to fix in one&rsquo;s own design after a while of not looking at it). The danger of course is the potential occasional truth of the maxim: &ldquo;If it takes one person one day to finish a job, it takes two people two days.&rdquo; :-&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! Easy on man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy on man right back at ya! It was a rhetorical question.  :-)</p>
<p>My point was that incapability could not have been the reason for Christian to have initiated this collaboration. Although it can be sometimes, like if a person [thinks he] is not good at spacing (re: Gill) and passes the job along to others; but like I said, this can be dangerous to &ldquo;total&rdquo; quality.</p>
<p>But there still has to be a practical dimension. Although possibly I need to see things like &ldquo;I wanted to work with this guy&rdquo; as in fact having a &ldquo;practical&rdquo; core&hellip; in an &ldquo;I, Robot&rdquo; sort of way.  :-&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Paul and I work together, the division of labor is really unclear.</p>

<p>Would you say this slows things down but results in something better?

<p>Notan? What on earth is that! I would say the Monotype chaps did a good job, I love metal Gill at text sizes, it has a lovely feel. Not too keen about the digital, though.</p>
<p><cite>if you’re making a “conventional” Latin text face, are the norms of what instances of letterspacing “simply work” perhaps reliable enough not to require any discussion beyond things like “I think it should be looser”?</cite></p>
<p>I read this in Updike: &ldquo;The eye is the sovereign ruler of taste&rdquo;. It is as simple and complicated as that!</p>
<p><cite>I would have to say that from where I stand, perhaps yes, but then “conventional” becomes quite distant from “ideal”; and when Kris says “it gets the job done”, that raises a red flag for me..</cite></p>
<p>Your ideal may be different from mine or Christian&rsquo;s, but we can all tell when it is wrong, it&rsquo;s just a matter of making it as right as we can. What is wrong with &ldquo;getting the job done&rdquo;? It is a job to me, it is part of what I do when I work. And I was brought up with the working value of &ldquo;if you are going to do something, you might as well do it properly&rdquo;. So when I say get the job done, I mean it in the fullest sense of the word.</p>
<p><cite>Although it can be sometimes, like if a person [thinks he] is not good at spacing (re: Gill) and passes the job along to others; but like I said, this can be dangerous to “total” quality.</cite></p>
<p>The total quality? What if you picked your favourite 5 typefaces and investigated the production method? It might be revealing…</p>
<p><cite>But there still has to be a practical dimension.</cite></p>
<p>There is: two heads (four eyes) are better than one! Don&rsquo;t be so empirical ;-) This is type design, done with the hand, heart &amp; head to be ultimately judged by the eye.</p>

<p>And the typeface wouldn&rsquo;t be the same as that done by one mind!</p>
<p>Ah yes, notan is interesting. Legato is an interesting one, and it is no surprise that people don&rsquo;t like the notan. Do you think that re-spacing it might make it more palatable for them?</p>
<p><cite>But I don’t see how this is a reflection on anything but scale; I don’t see it
as a reflection on quality, at least not the type of quality I personally value.</cite></p>
<p>True—but we are talking about collaboration, not quality. That is a separate matter in which I&rsquo;ll keep my opinions to myself!</p>

<p>The nature of Legato is such that respacing it can only make it worse.
This is because the inside white is &ldquo;virtually ligated&rdquo; with the outside
white; the inside white is what makes the font strange (if only to geeks
like us) and hence unappealing to some.</p>
<p>What would be interesting though is to make a &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; sister to
Legato and try to gauge any difference in how the two affect readers.</p>
