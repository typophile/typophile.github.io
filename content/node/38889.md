  and i'm currently working on a design for print project. Its an ISTD project called
  'doing my nut in' about slang and differences in spoken language in countries and
  places. I'm doing mine on old irish words that my father remembers being incorporated
  into spoken english when he was a child that have now mostly fallen out of usage.\r\nI'm
  hoping to illude to letterpress and uncial character in my piece that will take
  the form of a small square handmade booklet, with perhaps the use of handmade embossments
  (that i will do myself).\r\n\r\nhttp://istd.org.uk/flash_content/index.htm\r\n\r\nI
  was just wondering if anyone had any opinions on this approach!\r\nthank you\r\n(long
  time typophile reader first time user) "

  body: "That sounds really cool Onoron. How are you going to make it look like letterpress?...
    just curious. What are you going to base your embossments off of?... again, just
    curious.\r\n\r\nMake sure to post you final project in the future so we can see
    the finished product. \r\n\r\ngood luck-"

  body: "Well looking at the work of Phil Baines and Johnathan Barnbrook I've just
    been playing around with the typeface I'll use, and looking at quite traditional
    or more formal manner of book layout in letterpress. So a lot of trips to the
    Irish Print Museum!\r\nI'm more than likely going to make copper plate etches
    of the items I want to emboss and then do as many runs as I can before binding
    the book together myself.\r\nWell thats the plan anyway! "
