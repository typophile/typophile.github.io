I'm currently working on a brief based on a typographic portrayal of his 'Man In Black' so any suggestions on typefaces relating to the song in particular would be great also, although i guess Cash's personality and the song itself are going to have similar references.  

Again, any suggestions welcome.

These are all off by a country mile. Johnny Cash was an outlaw and a criminal before he found God and turned into a "good" or "lawful evil" dude. After that point Cash entered the mainstream yet he remained permanently on the shady side of the law and the establishment.

These bulky, masculine slab serif candidates are in the ryte ballpark but they lack the subversiveness and non-conformity of the man himself. They're too conventional and law-abiding. (Oh some dys I will do anything just to get a few hyphenates in. Ah, that was a good hit back there).

The embarrassing part is I can't name any butch slab serifs that evoke these aspects of Johnny's personality.

They are all good candidates but they lack soul.

		<div class="commentbody">James, I was sort of thinking the same thing.
Also, what I'd stress more is his musicality – from which there is a fine line to the vulnerability, even fragility that he displayed, in extremo, in his last years (that 'Hurt' video). Even for 'Man in Black', I'd at least mix in a shot of Archer (not use it; cross-breed it with some others) and stay at a reasonable distance from Facebuster and the like – those feel too loud, brutal, and yes, they exude more of a law-abiding, unbroken masculinity than I'd see in Cash.
Unfortunately, my knowledge of the type universe is not such that I could throw in a couple names that do exactly what I'm trying to describe, though. :-(</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I see a massive change in Cash's life after he became a christian.  Earlier I see rebellion, strength, arrogance even.  I think of this as a big bold slab serif with funky angles.

Then, later in life he softened, he let his guard down and yes, became fragile and beautiful like a spider's web or a glass sculpture.  I don't see him losing his masculinity in this at all, but he had less armor protecting the real Johnny inside.  This period I see as a script, or some light-weight yet sturdy serif, something that has a very personal touch.

I think later in life he also became very aware of his mortality, he probably had a lot of close calls earlier in life, but I think a man changes when he realizes he might not be around much longer, I think his purpose and his focus changed totally from before - so I don't think I could summarize his entire life into just one typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i'd say because it's a portrayal of the song more so than his personality, and the two perhaps aren't exactly the same. So it would be a representation of  the period he wrote the song.

I don't think the typeface has to be bang on - it just needs to fit, the song portrayal will be emphasized with how i treat the type and the lyrics and print methods etc i choose. 

On another note I am going to contrast this with another song, i was thinking 'White Christmas' - Bing Crosby. One song is quite brutally honest for that period of time and the other is more of a song for escapism and "feel good" listening (in my opinion). Oh yeah one's black and the others white, ha. 

Cheers again for all the input!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would not use a typeface of the digital generation (i.e. post-mid 1980s).
I see Hoefler types as a quite radical new take on your local culture (I'm speaking of North America, I am Italian), very related to the crispness of vector drawing.
Once, having met Stan Ridgway on his BBS, I would have liked to try a design of his Wall of Voodoo DVD, and what I though at the time was to scan original woodtypes and then arrange them.
But maybe you'd need to pair it with something more usable for textsetting…

EDIT: What about having a look at Marcus Burlile's "collage" alphabets:

Maybe anachronistical, but there could be something handy…</div>
