  those tasty captions. Sometimes [capital i] has serifs, sometimes not. <BR>Maybe
  they were hand-drawn? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance   <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66966.gif"

  body: Should be &#39;<a href="http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Alpha+Headline/"
    target="_blank">Alpha Headline</a>&#39;, by Cornel Windlin / Lineto.. <BR><i>&#40;
    Which originally started out as a CAPS ONLY headline typeface, and which is, sadly
    enough, no longer commercially available, as it became the new corporate typeface
    for Mitsubishi.. &#41;</i>

  body: The same. Alpha headline has subtle differences between the lowercase and
    uppercase character sets. The LC has no serifs on the I.

  body: Hehe, I was going to post the link to the same thread with Alpha headline
    charset, but occasionaly pressed F5 to see that I was late ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Do
    you know typefaces that come pretty close to Alpha headline &#40;maybe derived
    from english car registration plates too&#41;, maybe like FTF Flama, but preferably
    with serifs on [capital i]? <BR>I hope I&#39;m not too nosy <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    is a valid alternative, but unfortunately no serifs on the I.
