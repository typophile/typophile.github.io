- body: "My first impression was that the mark is too close to the P. It's the edge
    of the roof that comes too close; have you tried slightly tilting the house on
    it's axis to the left? Just enough so the gutter doesn't butt against the P's
    serif. \r\n\r\nOh, and what font is that? I can't place it. It's nice. "
