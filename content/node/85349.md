  body: Derek Birdsall stated in his book "Notes on Book Design" that It should not
    be an arbitrary decision, "the suitability of type design to the subject of the
    book is less important than the nature of it's text"

  body: "During the 20th century some of the larger type foundries, typesetters, and
    printing companies produced typographic style guides, which occasionally addressed
    the layout of book pages.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the 1923 <em>Linotype Manual of
    Typography</em> shows various types in actual size page layouts.\r\nSo too does
    <em>Book Types from Clowes</em> (a British printer), 1935.\r\nAnd <em>The Western
    Type Book</em> (Western Printing Services, Bristol, UK [West England]), 1960.\r\n\r\nAll
    these were hard-bound type specimen books of 200+ pages.\r\n\r\nThat practice
    is gone, for economic reasons related to technological change.\r\n\r\nToday, the
    standard is represented by Robert Bringhurst's <em>The Elements of Typographic
    Style</em>.\r\n\r\nPositioning his work in a similar manner to that of the style
    guides for editors (e.g. Strunk and White), Bringhurst covers many aspects of
    typography, including the page layout of books.\r\n"

  body: "I suspect the quote should be \"the suitability of type design to the subject
    of a book is <strong>no</strong> less important than the nature of <strong>its</strong>
    text\"; and it is true that, for example, the use of William Morris' Golden type
    - or something very similar, such as Jenson Oldstyle - in a book on higher mathematics
    would be as jarring as an excessively informal writing style.\r\n\r\nHobo, Papyrus,
    President or even Freehand as a text face would, of course, be even worse. And
    yet, the American Mathematical Society, in commissioning a typeface for the printing
    of mathematics, ended up with the unconventional AMS Euler, with a calligraphic
    effect.\r\n\r\nHowever, egregious errors in the former are even less common than
    egregious errors in the latter. A typeface such as Palatino, for example, would
    seem to do well in either a textbook or a novel."
