body: "Hello everyone,\r\nI'm writing here because I'm designing a book, and I need
  some help to find different typography examples (possibly literature, poems, or
  other book pages), for the romantic, realist and symbolist period. \r\n\r\nRomanticism:
  I found already some examples, but most of them are set in gothic types, because
  the books I found which are explicitly romantic are designed in Germany or Switzerland.
  Robert Bringhurst writes in \"The elements of typographic style\" that for example
  Didot and Walbaum are romantic typefaces, but I can't find any typically romantic
  literature set in those typefaces.\r\n\r\nRealism: Bringhurst also writes that for
  example Akzidenz Grotesk or Clarendon are realist typefaces, but I can't find any
  realist literature set in those typefaces.\r\n\r\nSymbolism: the only informations
  I have about symbolist typography is that, as Tschichold writes in \"Die Neue Typographie\",
  Johannes Itten tryed to create some symbolist typography in the magazine \"Utopia\",
  published in 1921 in Weimar, I only found [[http://www.vloemans.net/item.php?bookid=4926&c_sourcepage=highlights.php%3Fpg%3D1%23booknr4926|this
  pages]] ) , but I don't if they are the right ones. And I know that there should
  be some symbolist typography in the original publication \"Le Fleuve\" by Charles
  Cros (with illustrations by Manet), but I only saw the illustrations without typography.\r\n\r\nI
  hope that there's some one who can help me."

  body: "There is a difficulty with categorization. Someone or a group may put type
    or other things in groups as a means of discussing their characteristics but this
    does not mean that they will be used by any number of users in the way described
    by the original category definer. Works of literature are likewise put in to groups--sometimes
    by a school of thought and sometimes by the name of the prevailing period at the
    time they were published. Publishers have their own way of deciding which typeface
    to use and it may have nothing to do with the period of the author or the subject
    matter written about. It is more likely to be part of the working process of the
    publisher and which types they own and generally use. Perhaps only books that
    are self-published, where the writer is involved in the whole process, may more
    care be taken to match a typeface with an author or  text.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    I\u2019ve seen two books set in a modern face. Both are contemporary sci-fi. And
    you can\u2019t find literature in Akzidenz or Clarendon because nobody uses them
    for books after junior year.\r\n\r\nAnd FYI, Bringhurst\u2019s classification
    system gets very little use outside of Wikipedia entries, so don\u2019t expect
    a lot of people to be familiar with the Bringhurst classifications."

  body: "Thank's for your answers. I know that there are a lot of difficults in classification,
    and also that the evolution of typography wasn't everytime parallel to them of
    arts (intended as artistic and literature periods). I totally agree with you ChrisL.\r\n\r\nFortunately
    after days of research I found, as you said, some smaller publication (maybe self-published)
    which I think correspond better to this classfications, ore have at least different
    concepts in common with the corresponding art style.\r\n\r\nI (now) only need
    some typography samples which I can interpret as inspired by the concurrent artistic
    situation. And I found some."

  body: "Just one thing: it was not uncommon to see book typeset in Didot in France
    until the 1960s. You can find plenty on ebay. However, the smaller prints were
    made with specific Didot characters which are easily confused with Egyptians.
    avec a look at ITC Bodoni 6 and the difference with 12 and 72. ITC Bodoni 6 is
    fantastic in paperback books! I read a novel typeset with it the other day and
    it is wonderful.\r\n\r\nCheck google books: search for Didot tanner."

    a few years.\r\nA few months ago I picked up a 1943 copy of Wuthering Heights,
    set in Bodoni.\r\nOriginally, of course, it was set in a Scotch Modern.\r\n\r\nThese
    days most people think that oldstyle faces are more appropriate for works of the
    Romantic era. Go figure. "

  body: "I don't think there's much figuring to do, Nick. I have the feeling that
    only a small number of people who design books make any attempt at matching typefaces
    with the era in which a book was written or with the era under consideration in
    the text.\r\n\r\nThe situation is just as ChrisL noted in the last part of his
    note: publishers or designers they hire have type libraries consisting of fonts
    they use often, and many rarely venture beyond.\r\n\r\nI'd differ with Chris on
    the matter of self-published books, though. In that realm there's even less attention
    made to this sort of matching of type era and text era.\r\n\r\npowers"
