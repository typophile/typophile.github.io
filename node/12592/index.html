<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t get though is the right legs of &ldquo;h&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo;: is that on purpose? If so, the intention (adding character?) might be good, but it&rsquo;s hard to see this feature working out well in the end.</p>
<p>The caps are a bit too dark.</p>
<p>The spacing needs a lot of work! :-/ But overall it has a nice tightness - I&rsquo;d keep that.</p>
<p>And some macro stuff: the color is a bit darkish (which I actually like), but if you&rsquo;re shooting for mainstream usage, it implies optimal setting at smaller sizes. If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re shooting for, I would: loosen the spacing; and pull in the descenders a bit. Otherwise I would: lighten the color; and lengthen the ascenders a bit.</p>
<p>BTW, it would be nice to see a character set too.</p>
<p>And one more thing: good luck!</p>

<p>The caps: reduce the weight.</p>
<p>Spacing: a good first start is the scheme in Walter Tracy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters of Credit&rdquo;. As for the tightness issue I mentioned, I meant that I think you should keep it slightly tight overall (partly because the color is darkish).</p>
<p>Mainstream versus idiosyncratic color: at any given time in type design history, most designers will have a preference for lighter or darker fonts. In the Middle Ages people liked dark fonts, while in the 70s they liked very light fonts. That&rsquo;s been moving more towards dark lately, but some people (like Fred Smeijers) still prefer a color that&rsquo;s darker than most other designers agree is good. I like darkish fonts too. A designer can justify a preference for something outside the mainstream either by simply saying that&rsquo;s the way he likes it (not too hot), or by believing that users benefit (very good).</p>

<p>It took some day to react to that comment. Could you elaborate a bit on that. I don&rsquo;t know what the word darkish mean. In french we say <em>gris typographique</em>. Is that you want to say?</p>

<p>I would agree with Hrant&rsquo;s comments about the weight of the caps, spacing, the h and m, and so on.</p>
<p>I think the revised version shows a lot of improvement over the earlier one. One thing that stuck out to my eye was that there was not enough space on the left side of the lowercase a. It looks fine now.</p>
<p>Some things I&rsquo;m seeing in the new version:</p>
<p>Certain characters&ndash;the A, a, G, s, V, 4, for example&ndash;look slightly bolder than the rest. It&rsquo;s not just these characters, but those are the ones that stand out to me.</p>
<p>The X appears to lean to the left, and there is too much space on its right side (or the left side of the Y).</p>
<p>The curve on the bowl of the R is too thin.</p>
<p>I liked your previous non-connecting fi and fl ligatures better. It&rsquo;s traditional, but I don&rsquo;t think it necessarily makes sense to connect the characters in a sans serif. You&rsquo;re really just trying to correct the problem of the f colliding with other characters. Connecting the characters is not the only way to do this.</p>
<p>I think you need to spend more time with the ampersand. I can&rsquo;t tell for sure from your sample, but I would guess that you have drawn it with the counters as separate paths. During development, you don&rsquo;t have to draw your characters this way. You can make one continuous path with overlapping elements. That way, you get a nice flow to the strokes. You can remove the overlaps anytime before you generate the fonts. I do it as one of the last steps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to ear that. The # 1 was also my first choice. I checked a lot of typeface and I found there are a  majority of them sitting their lower storey on the baseline.  I though it was a part of the response to have a good readability. So I tried with mine but I was&rsquo;nt satisfied. For now I&rsquo;ll keep my first choice. Thanks</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just it&ndash;it doesn&rsquo;t align better. It looks like the top of the lower counter is below the baseline because there&rsquo;s no optical compensation. If apparent alignment is not the goal, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Nobody says it must align there (or appear to).</p>

<p>One thing about anything optical however: it depends on scale; you can&rsquo;t know the amount of optical compensation needed by just looking at magnified glyphs out of context. Most notably, this applies to basic things like the round overshoot of the &ldquo;o&rdquo; (as explained by Harry Carter in his translation of Fournier). What size is this design meant for? The larger the size, the less optical compensation you need, and there&rsquo;s a threshold above which it&rsquo;s worth just snapping to the exact alignement.</p>

<p>The binocular g seems as though it may be a dark spot at text sizes.  Perhaps it needs to be opened up some to get the space in it to feel like the rest of the glyphs. The single story g is the opposite, it looks a bit too large.  You might pull up the counter a bit so that the lower horizontal stroke is a bit above the baseline. In general, the double boweled g is supposed to be a bit more readable in text because it has greater differentiation but it may not always be the best fit for a particular typeface.
Do you have a PDF of Migration in text size and quantity? this would help evaluate the effect.</p>

<p>Mostly, the color is not uniform enough yet. The a, e, and g are dark spots.  You may have to decrease the horizontals in those glyphs and open the counters a bit (Look hard at the upper bowl of the g.).  I think your horizontal strokes overall need to be optically adjusted thinner.  Remember, you are trying to give the appearance of monoline, you are not actually making it measured as monoline. This shows up most as the size gets smaller.  If you intend this to be a text face, it is more of an issue. You may also consider putting some traps in to make it optically balanced in weight. In some cases, I can&rsquo;t tell if it is a metrics problem that contributes to unevenness but I think it is as well. I would decrease the sidebearings on curved sides of glyphs like b, d, p, q.  At this stage, I would not set samples justified, stick with ragged right for the moment.  It is too hard to separate out what spacing issues are due to your justification algorithm and which are inherent to your metrics. 
Set an &ldquo;nu&rdquo; necklace (nuanubnucnudnuenuf&hellip;) and then an &ldquo;o&rdquo; necklace (oaobocodoeofogohoio&hellip;) to test your sidebearings. Leave kerning off. Print strings of these at text sizes and make adjustments to sidebearings until the color is even. If you cannot get even color with this setting, it indicates that some of the glyphs need adjustment. Those will stick out like the g does now. This is a difficult stage.  For me, the first drawing of the glyphs is quick.  The longer time is spent going back and forth with spacing and glyph adjustments to turn a set of glyphs into a harmonious family.
I think you have to be sure you are consistent in spacing as well.  Look at page 2 column 2 at the word &ldquo;playwright&rdquo; and then at the word &ldquo;works&rdquo; on the next line. Look at the &ldquo;ri&rdquo; and then the &ldquo;rk&rdquo; The r seems farther from the i than it does to the k.
Mostly, just keep at it.  You will get a good result for your efforts. I think it is coming along well. You just need to push through the hard part.  You will see. I am confident you will end up with a good typeface for your efforts.</p>

<p>Chris, did you make that up yourself?  :-)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>André, some of the changes you&rsquo;ve made are quite interesting - it makes the font more unique, not to mention harder to evaluate - but I do think in some spots you&rsquo;ve gone too far&hellip;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;g&rdquo; for one needs a lot of work all of a sudden - although in the context of some of things you seem to have done, it probably won&rsquo;t work to simply go back to one of your previous forms&hellip; Instead, I would: put less weight in the head, as well as the join between the head and lower bowl; and put more weight into the left side of the lower bowl. The UC &ldquo;S&rdquo;: bad curves throughout. The florin: should slant. The Brit Pound: smaller head. Quotes: too much stroke contrast.</p>
<p>The cap height: I think it&rsquo;s too close to the ascender height.
I would either make them the same, or more clearly different.</p>
<p>The traps: I think they&rsquo;re cool, but inconsistent. Have you
seen this? <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html</a>
It helps you quickly put consistent trapping in a font.</p>

Chris, did you make that up yourself? :-)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should I have said string of pearls? :-)</p>
<p>Actually, the term &ldquo;necklace&rdquo; was used regularly by Arnold Bank, my calligraphy teacher from the early 60s.  I don&rsquo;t think he invented it though. It was probably a long-standing calligraphy thing. 
Arnold had us do many n and o necklaces as practice for calligraphy. It was more about developing consistency in writing than measuring side-bearings. It seemed like a good term and it stuck with me low these many years.</p>

You asked me about text to test your typeface in. I thought I would post an answer here. You might consider longer sections of text in different languages to see the different letter combinations that come up and may need attention. In case you are not already aware of it, a good site to find multilingual text is the United Nations Human Rights Charter which has the text set in many languages.  Here is the link if you don&rsquo;t know it :

Here&rsquo;s one I found for Greek polytonic, Smyth&rsquo;s Grammar.</p>

<p>However, there is something a bit strange about its polytonic, as the plain tonos-accented characters are taken from the monotonic character-set.</p>

Your PDF now works correctly.
You have done much work. It is a GREAT improvement!  At first glance the  l, j, and t bottom terminals (at the hook) seem a bit out of sorts with each other.  The l seems to be the problem.  I can&rsquo;t seem to resolve why it is not vertical like the other two?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to keep the curve terminal of my l, t and j but I think your right about they seem a bit out of sorts with each other. I think the problem is when I reduced the horizontal stroke of all my glyph.  I did the same treatment to those 3 letters and it seems it wasn&rsquo;t the solution to take.</p>
<p>I wonder if it would be a good idea to try to work with the terminal of the a or the mu or somewhere between thoses two and the actual l, j and t. I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also try to use a vertical stems for them.</p>

<p>The curve of the n looks a little bent here:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/n.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I would make it smoother. Same with the h, m, and u.</p>
<p>In letters like the s, the thickness of the stroke is a little uneven. I&rsquo;m not saying it should be the same all the way round, but that it should flow more evenly from the narrower parts at the end to the thickest part in the middle. The curve itself could be smoother.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The n, m, u, and h are looking good. I think the cap S still needs a little work around the insides of the curve at the top left and bottom right. I&rsquo;m still seeing a slight kink. One trick that I use is to hold down the shift key while moving the curve point. This moves the curve point without moving the handles. The result is that the extrema can be adjusted without altering the overall curve very much. Sometimes that&rsquo;s all it takes to get the curve to flow nicely.</div>

<p>a: very cute. I&rsquo;d move the inside apex of the top counter to the right a bit.
c: bottom-left is a bit weak.
e: top-left too thick.
g: nice.
el: curl too thick.
t: surprising - but I think it works.</p>
<p>F, T: too wide.
K: arm weights are off.
N: interesting stroke-weight decisions. Could work. In any case, don&rsquo;t let the chiro-ghosts scare you.</p>
<p>Nums: nice. The &ldquo;5&rdquo; is out of character though.</p>
<p>ae: top too thick.
AE: too heavy, especially at left.
guillemet(s): funny stroke contrast.
BP: very nice.
percent/permille: circles too big.
asterisk: tilt it more.
?: very nice. Just the bottom-right of the head is too thick.
at: I&rsquo;d use a mono &ldquo;a&rdquo; inside.
dagger(s): wassup with the flaring?
section: leaning right.
pilcrow: interesting. Don&rsquo;t like it.  :-)
TM: bar of &ldquo;T&rdquo; too thick.
quotes: I would space the doubles tighter than two singles.</p>
<p>Blank space: wider.</p>
<p>BTW, it&rsquo;s good to see you using the Flower. Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your basic forms are finished first.</li>
<li>The mouth of the traps is too big.* Use a smaller Flower, but maybe increase the Multiplier. Or maybe your Minimum ring is too big. To be sure, could you show a Flower in place, like on the &ldquo;v&rdquo;?</li>
<li>You have to decide between the trapping in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; versus the &ldquo;M&rdquo; versus the &ldquo;V&rdquo;. Or is that what you&rsquo;re trying to do right now? :-)  Personally I think the &ldquo;V&rdquo; is most likely to be best.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Unless this is for really small sizes. In fact your color, spacing and proportions suit that too&hellip; So is that definitely your target now? Sorry if I haven&rsquo;t been paying [enough] attention.</li>

<p>It is looking realy good now.  You may now have to revisit spacing issues with letters that have open right sides like f and r. They seem to need their right sidebearings reduced to begin with and then perhaps some more kerning to curved letters on their right.</p>

<p>Question: What would you suggested after that? Work on a light version, bold version or something else.</p>
<p>I did not work on hinting yet, the problem is that I dont know how, so I&rsquo;ve to read on it. Howerver, is hinting is useful considering I plan to use Migration only as a print typeface?</p>

<p>If you plan to do a family with several weights, you might consider working on themost extreme weights (light and bold or even black). This way, you can you the Multile Master technique to generate the in-between weights.  You still need coreection to them but it is far less tha would be manually.</p>
<p>If you are only adding bold and italic to your regular, then I would do italic first. This helps when it comes time to do bold italic but mostly, I think you learn more from making an italic because it is different than roman or regular in character.</p>

You can use MM instances to generate the set and will have much less cleanup and redecision in the weights in the middle. The bolder you get, the more the MM interpolation is unable to make the best decisions.  The extremes require much rethought. That is not to say don&rsquo;t do a MM interpolation of the Black weight. It just means know that your work is just begun with the instance output.
Generating a medium or demibold is much easier and needs less human intervention.</p>

I would say italic because it teaches you more. Bold is fine as well. I just think you might get more knowledge out of the italic since it involves so much.</p>

<p>At first glance, your latest medium looks very clean and the spacing is much better. Well done!</p>
<p>The bold is a beginning. The joins on the n and r seem different.  The r is more successful in the bold.  The n at small sizes rounds off there and feels like a missprint. The upper horizontal on the b and d seem heavy at the join.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>André, looks like you&rsquo;ve got a good start on your bold weight. I just have one point to add to Chris&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>Characters that have more color to them (such as the a, e, g, and s) need to be opened up a bit in the counters. This has the effect of reducing the weight, so you want to do it in such a way that it is not obvious. The bolder the weight, the more you need to do it. Your bold is not super bold, so it may not take much. Your eye will (hopefully) tell you when it looks right, though it takes some experience to see it clearly. (It&rsquo;s not supposed to be noticed, after all.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>André,
It is good to see you back at work and making progress! You have done a great deal of work and should commend yourself for your labor :-)  I wish I could speak French but I know so very few words.  I envy your ability to speak several languages. Trés bon?</p>
<p>Your greatest challenge (as is mine) is the italic. Italic a and g look a bit too wide for the rest but the u looks too narrow; Tail of the g comes up too much for italic—perhaps it should be more like the y? The fi ligature is too closed.  The space between the f stem and the i stem in the ligature should be as far apart as the stems in the u. The ligatures in your upright fonts do look correct though.</p>
<p>The bold weight seems to have become too condensed.  It looks as if you added weight to only the inside.  You need to open up the counters of the bold to make it feel more like your normal weight proportions. The n, u, and h look too narrow for the rest. The g looks quite nice though!</p>
<p>I find that changing weights is much more difficult than it looks at first.  Sometimes it takes me longer to build the first weight change than it does to do the original! Don’t worry though, the ones between are much easier :-)
A way to examine your work is to lay your lighter weight on top of your heavier weight one glyph at a time in 2 different colors so you can see both.  Check to see if the bold has “grown” out of the light in a sensible way.</p>

<p>Do you have Adobe illustrator? That is what I used to make the exaple above in 2 colors.  I type the glyps one at a time and format them as the bold weight.  Then, I copied the glyphs using the select tool, not the text tool, and pasted in front; then I changed the type pasted in front to the lighter weight and changed the color.  This shows you what it looks like.  To work as you look, in FontLab, paste the light weight into the mask layer of the bold weight and line up the mask layer so that it is directly centered over the bold weight in the top layer.  That way, you can work on the outlines while looking at the mask layer at the same time.  There are no colors but you still can compare the outlines that way as you work.</p>

You have made great progress! I think you are getting close. There are things that I cannot see from your PDF because of spacing issues. There may be some dark spots to contend with which may clear up when your spacing issues are resolved.
Try doing the following:
Create a test string (what I call a necklace) using first straight vertical side glyphs and then round glyphs. Do this in both cap and lower case. HAHBHCHDHEHFHGH&hellip;OAOBOCODOEOFOGOHO&hellip;0102030405060708090. For lower case, it is best to mage a 2-letter necklace: nuanubnucnudnuenufnugnu&hellip;
The point is to sandwhich each glyph between two upright strokes. There will be no kerning needed for these pairings so be sure kerning is off. The idea is to adjust the sidebearings untill you have an even rythum with not breaks or dark spots. After you have done the straight necklace, move to the &ldquo;o&rdquo; necklace. 
Make a testing of these strings in various sizes between 9pt and 24pt. Post a pdf of this with no kerning. You will later perhaps need a few kern pairs for situations like &ldquo;ro&rdquo; and &ldquo;vo&rdquo; but leave that for later.</p>

<p>You wrote to turn off the kerning. May I turn off kerning in FL before to generate my typeface (Generate Suitcase)? If so, I do not know how and where in FL — sorry of my ignorance :^\</p>

In the FontLab metrics window, there are two icons for the two states &ldquo;Metrics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kerning&rdquo;. Turn on the &ldquo;Metrics&rdquo; one to just see your strings withpout kerning and make adjustments that way. 
Then, output your fonts as usual but when you produce your samples, turn kerning off in InDesign (select all your text first). See the little popup which says &ldquo;Metrics, Optical, zero&rdquo; and set to zero or none. This way, you just turn kerning off temporarilly for the purpose of the test.</p>

Before I comment and bias your opinion, I want you to print out this latest file and let it sit for a few days without looking at it. I want you to have a bit of distance to see it fresh. Then look at your printouts and post what you think you see. Look mostly at the lower case and compare the weights.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>André,
The excersize was to get you to look at your spacing. At this point, your spacing has to be adjusted before  I (at least) can see if there are issues with your glyphs. For my vision, the straight sided glyphs do not have enough sidebearing and make the letters clump up.  Try to balance the interletter spacing with the counters so that they are in harmony, not in opposition.</p>
