  searching for the font used in the 'Turner Prize' Logo,\r\nat first I thought it
  kind of looked like the (wonderful)  [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=Estilo&x=0&y=0&sample_text=TURNER%20PRIZE%20%2008%20%2F%20o8&update=0|Estilo]],
  as it's soft and Round and has a Swashed 'R' which in this case is done custom (or
  at least I think so,...) and after searching it resembles [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/ulissa_rounded_vp/?&sample_text=TURNER%20PRIZE%20%2008%20%2F%20o8&update=0|the
  Ulissa]]\r\nMaybe someone does know what 'is' used in this case?\r\nThanks, A+\r\n\r\n\r\n"
