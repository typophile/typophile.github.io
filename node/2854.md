body: I&#39;m looking for a font &#40;or fonts&#41; that can be used for a header
  that gives a feel of &#34;Chaos&#34;, or one that just looks &#34;Evil&#34;, or
  abnormally serious. One that makes the word &#34;Makai&#34; look good &#40;and by
  good I mean the opposite of Ugly&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;By the way, I wasn&#39;t sure
  where I should&#39;ve posted this, but, Yeah, I tried this section&#41;.

  body: Mason is too overused for my tastes and a little &#34;magicy&#34;, Banshee
    is nice, but it&#39;s a little &#34;Happy&#34;, the fonts by Margo Chase are a
    bit too clich

  body: hmm, those are all nice, too, I especially like FF Disturbance, it seems like
    it&#39;d be good for quotes. <BR> <BR>How about some fonts that are Elegantly
    Dark, too? &#40;Does that make sense?&#41;

    Nothing exists without its opposite.&#41; <BR> <BR>Aleph, can a font be both dirty
    and elegant? <BR> <BR>BTW, I think Margo Chase rules. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Adriano, <BR> <BR>Excellent evil suggestions. About the double and tripple
    posting: just click the post button once &#40;it is realtime&#41;. If any error
    messages come up, or it takes a long time, disregard them, your message will be
    posted. <BR> <BR>What I do is launch a duplicate window before posting. Then do
    the posting process. After a couple of seconds, close the posting window &#40;regardless
    of whether it&#39;s finished loading&#41;. When you refresh the remaining window
    you will see your post. <BR> <BR>Randy'

    login and update the settings to display the word&#40;s&#41; you need and then
    do a keyword search. This helps visualize other options you might not consider.
    Also, I&#39;m not a big fan of free fonts, but a recent client wanted to do a
    poster that had writing like the old really bad &#34;b&#34; monster movies &#40;i.e.
    the swamp thing, black lagoon&#41;. He didn&#39;t find anything that work in the
    commercial arena so we did a search in the free fonts and he found the perfect
    one. It is a really bad quality font that gave the exact look he wanted. <BR>
