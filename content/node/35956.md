  folks at last. This is my very first post on this site, and I'm not entirely sure
  what to expect. Anyhow, I'll trow my thoughts out there anyways..\r\n\r\nSo basically
  I'm looking for a tres cool sans-serif typeface with rounded edges. Pardon my lack
  of adequate vocab here...part of the reason why I'd like to join is because I'd
  like to broaden my horizon when it comes to such things. So please be patient with
  me...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? \r\n\r\nMerci in advance\r\n\\"

  body: I prefer the proportions of Barmeno; to me Sari's curves are not taut enough,
    and it looks too round and spacey. I love the pound sign and lining figures of
    Barmeno. Maybe it's just me?
