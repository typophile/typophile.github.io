  basically i have to communicate the feel or sense of a city using as little images
  as possible and at least 500 words, for typography. Basically a print based design
  on any format from a4 to a1. <BR> <BR>I can choose any place what so ever but i
  have chosen tokyo, any ideas anybody?

  body: Ok basically here is an outline of the brief... <BR> <BR>Its called cityscape
    <BR> <BR>Basically using more typographical methods, i have to bestly show a city
    of my choice through typography. <BR> <BR>An exmaple of someones work was they
    choice i think it was venice and they have illustations of buildings very classy
    in a landscape format and for the water that flows through venice &#40;i think
    it is there&#41;, they used words 500minimum and blended them into there own cityscape.
    <BR> <BR>I am trying to explain best i possibly can. The image can be anything
    i choose but it has to convey &#39;the city&#39; to a viewer, having typography
    as the main medium. <BR> <BR>So far for ideas i am struggling alot, however i
    have come up with designers republic style images that have type flowing into
    them, yet this is more &#39;design&#39; than &#39;idea&#39;

  body: Alex, it seems the best way I would approach this project is through history.
    Pick a city a time and place and then illustrate it through type. I live in Manhattan
    and maybe Harlem during the 1940s &#40;the black jazz era&#41; would be a great
    typographic starting point.

    one page and go to topic and you will see you are the most recent post. This site
    is in the process of fixing this problem. Until then

  body: If your chosing Tokoyo and your trying to get across the feel of a city then
    I would check out the japanese language, look at anime styles, the culture, food
    - everything and then take the elements you think are most important.  <BR>Respect
    and money are considered very important so choosing a font that  represents that
    is paramount to getting across the right idea, instead of relying on imagery &#40;you
    did say you have to use the least amount&#41; have you not thought about creating
    imagery from the body of text you have to create?  <BR> <BR>To be honest you have
    to go away and sit down and really flesh out all of your ideas, little or big
    what ever, consider medium, what you want to communicate and how you expect to
    arrive at your outcome.
