  designed in the seventies, but i think the font is much older and maybe won't even
  be available in digital form.\r\n\r\nthe only close result i got through whatthefont
  was <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/kylemott/bold/\">kylemott</a>
  (only its capitals)\r\n\r\ndoes someone know more about this? i know some people
  here know a lot about the history of grotesk and some forgotten typefaces.\r\n\r\nthank
  you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scan_woelfli_6158.jpg]"
