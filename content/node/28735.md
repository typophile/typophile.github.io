  body: "Doubtless Ms Wardle will be along shortly to address this series of questions;
    she is expert in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe answer to all questions is: check the
    EULA for the typeface(s) in question. Foundries' EULAs are a very mixed bag, and
    each foundry dis/allows different things.\r\n\r\nTo answer each question a little
    bit less globally...\r\n\r\n1) Check the EULA. Some foundries allow this. Some
    do not. Some will allow outlining of fonts to vector art, some will not. Some
    will allow embedding in PDF artwork, some will not...\r\n\r\n2) Check with the
    client and/or the foundry. The client may have arranged a license which allows
    them to sub-license the fonts to their vendors for specific uses or projects.
    (These sub-licenses are rarely made clear to the vendors.)\r\n\r\n3a) Check the
    EULA. Most licensing arrangements will be \"site-specific\" or \"company-specific\".
    Most foundries will ask either that the client licenses the typeface(s) separately,
    or if the designer wishes to send the typeface(s) to her client, that the designer
    has licensed the fonts in such a way that all end users are covered.\r\n\r\n3B)
    Check the EULA. However, it is pretty safe to say that if a designer licenses
    a retail typeface, the use of that typeface is not restricted to specific clients
    of projects, and is will not expire. If the typeface is a custom or bespoke creation,
    there will almost certainly be stipulations about use.\r\n\r\n4) This is a question
    for the ages, which has vexed man since the time of the Roman Empire. In my personal
    experience, (most) studios, regardless of size or budget, buy the smallest possible
    licensing for a typeface, and never think about it again. They proceed to include
    it in artwork releases to service bureaux, and will send it away to clients without
    a second thought. Most designers ignore EULAs, even though they have agreed to
    them in the course of a license purchase."

  body: "1) I can't imagine a graphic designer anywhere would abide by a license that
    would not allow outlining fonts as vector art when the work product is sent to
    the printer. \r\n\r\n4) That has been my experience as well. Most design firms
    have no idea where their fonts came from. \r\n\r\nSo, does anyone out there work
    for a design firm that ethically, legally manages their fonts? I'd sure like to
    hear about how they went about it. They must have had to do a review of what they
    had and make some kind of new policy. I have fonts that were purchased, sent to
    me by clients, etc. Most are not on an original disk and therefore do not have
    the original license. Some do, some don't have the license in the same folder
    as the font. What do you do about that? Burn it to the ground and start over?
    Re-buy them all? What do you do about fonts that were purchased from long defunct
    retailers like Eyewire if you can't find the license you must have received when
    you made the purchase?\r\n"

  body: "Hi. Ms. Wardle here. Mr. Village has answered as I would have done had I
    seen this thread earlier.\r\n\r\nThe first line of action is, as Village has stated,
    to read the EULA for the foundry. You might think it dampens your creativity,
    but it saves you headaches -- should you choose to be above board -- in the end.\r\n\r\nVery
    few EULAs disallow turning the type to outlines. At least those which I've read
    and am familiar with. \r\n\r\n<em>1) Is it legal and within my rights to send
    fonts to the printer when the job goes to press?</em>\r\n\r\nVery few foundries
    allow for this. Check the EULA for all foundries.\r\n\r\n<em>2) If a client sends
    you fonts on a disk for a job that a previous studio created is it legal to use
    the fonts?</em>\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to bet that 9.9 out of 10 times the company
    has not licensed the fonts to allow for distribution to other daughter companies.
    You need to check with the client. If they stare back at you with glazed over
    eyes proceed to the phone and call the foundries necessary and properly license
    the fonts to protect yourself. Foundries are watching who uses their fonts.\r\n\r\n<em>3a)
    If a designer buys a font to use for a particular client does that client have
    the right to use the font?</em>\r\n\r\nShort answer, no. Long answer, if you licensed
    a font to use on a client's project the best thing you could do is have the client
    also license the font so they can use it if need be. There are some foundries
    which have EULAs that allow for transferring of the license. (Transferring means
    you would have to give the clients the font, alert the foundry to the new address
    and user, and remove it from your computer. But you might know that.)\r\n\r\n<em>3B)
    If a designer buys a font to use for a particular client does the designer have
    the right to use the font for a different client?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. The license
    is in the designer's name with the designer's location and can be used until you
    are sick of the font. \r\n\r\n<em>4) How do most design studios manage their font
    licenses?</em>\r\n\r\nI manage mine with patience and a huge paper trail. If you
    really want to make sure you are kosher on all counts you could call the foundries
    from who you have fonts and double-check to make sure you are legal. If not I'm
    sure they'd be more than happy to work that out with you over the phone. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Goldarn EULAs! \r\n\r\nEven if you do call the foundry, you have to know
    when, and from whom, you made the purchase...different sources offer different
    terms, and the terms of some EULAs have been altered over the years. Which version
    was in force when you made your purchase? Did the agreement you made allow for
    after the fact changes to the agreement?\r\n\r\nA weird example:\r\nIf you buy
    FB Californian from Font Bureau, you have to pay extra to make a PDF with it,
    but if you picked up the \"Greetings 2000\" CD (Microsoft, with a \"Hallmark connections\"
    label) a few years ago for 20 or 30 bucks, you own a TT version of FB Californian
    that has its font embedding settings set to \"editable embedding\"!  FB presumably
    knew what it was doing when it set those bits. What _are_ you allowed to do with
    this version? \r\n\r\nSo the moral is, I guess, try to keep track of these things
    as you acquire fonts.\r\n"

    that EULAs have always been a part of the \"buying\" process. (buying=licensing)
    As such, it has always been the end-user's responsibility. \r\n\r\nIt isn't like
    the EULA is a new thing. So you can't blame the foundries for our lack of organization
    of our license. Right?"
