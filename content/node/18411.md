  with running text, which make it difficult to read due to low line spacing and a
  lack of paragraphs\". In German this is called \"Bleiw\xFCste\" (literally: desert
  of hot type).\r\n\r\nThanks"

    body: I need this for the English translation of a book review, in which also
      the book's design is covered. Besides, as a translator I am very much interested
      in the right terminology.

  body: "Further to Chris' comment copy-heavy is used for a document that has so much
    copy and so few pages that readability suffers, although it doesn't specifically
    cover lack of paragraphs or low line spacing. Low line spacing could be described
    as poorly leaded.\r\nTim"

    clotted layout of the text."'

    as an alternative...

  body: Dense, heavy, dark, cluttered, cramped, claustrophobic. These terms all work.
    I don't think there's one as good as the German, but then again English never
    quite had the flair of German for really specific word agglomerations.

    metaphorically imply the design lacks white space. (Agoraphobia being the part
    of social anxiety panic disorder that keeps people confined to their homes, characterized
    by the <em>fear of open spaces</em>).\r\n\r\nBut that's probably just as obtuse
    as using the German term <em>Bleiw\xFCste</em>!"

  body: "I've heard and used the term \"too gray\". I've heard, especially in newspaper
    work, that a designer wants to \"break up the gray\" by adding a picture or a
    pull-quote. The idea is that columns of type are \"the gray\" and need to be handled
    somehow.\r\n\r\n"
