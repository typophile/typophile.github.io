  like to know if there\u2019s an authoritative, \u201Cdefinitive\u201D ruling anywhere!\r\n\r\nSay
  you have a table where some columns have a simple column head, and other columns
  are grouped and have span-head with subheads underneath. Like, for example, this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/table_5317.GIF]\r\n\r\nNow,
  should that single-column header be aligned with the top row (as per this example)
  or with the bottom row? My manager (and, it seems, our typesetters) think the former.
  Many of our authors seem to think the latter. I can see both sides of the argument:
  aligned at the top seems to make structural/semantic sense, but aligned at the bottom
  keeps the heading <em>near to the data it relates to</em>.\r\n\r\nExample tables
  in Chicago and Oxford style guides seem to side with our authors, but they don\u2019t
  explicitly talk about this issue.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

  body: Vertically? So in this case having "Knowledge resource" on the same line as
    "Uniform", you mean?

    Knowledge resource would maybe better aligned to the bottom."

    a whole separate kettle of fish! So, vertically, you\u2019re agreeing with our
    authors and the style-guide examples."

  body: "Oh, sorry, I misread your question.\r\nBut, yes, I'd say bottom, because
    it relates directly with the column's content.\r\n(in a different design, maybe
    vertically centered could work too)"

  body: I would say bottom row, for the reason you suggest. Think of that heading
    not as a major heading with no subheads, but as a subhead with no overarching
    categories it belongs to. Imagine your levels of headings building out from bottom
    to top, not vice versa.

  body: I would say top aligned, to reflect that they are equal in hierarchy. But
    I don't think there's any right or wrong answer, it's mostly personal preference.

  body: I find myself in agreement with James. It's about hierarchy --  the right
    hand side may have three subdivisions or it may have a dozen, but it should not
    take the <em>other</em> major heading at its left down to its own level.

  body: "I\u2019m uncomfortable with the italics.\r\nItalics are a secondary style,
    so they should not be first in a layout.\r\nBold, caps, or small caps would be
    better.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt to have vertical rules and/or tonal areas
    for different cells: asymmetric minimalism is a bit vague for tabular layouts,
    which seems to be the source of your problem."

    but in this case I think they may help.

    design (not that I\u2019m in a position to implement them); Nick I quite agree
    that if it were down to me the column heads would be bold, not italic, and italic
    would then be for headings in the left column that \u201Cgroup\u201D rows of related
    data, in such tables as warrant them.\r\n\r\nYep, so it\u2019s looking like a
    fairly even spread of voices, and therefore down to personal preference. :^/"

    head) signifies what the head ranges over. In the bottom \"row\" (level of head),
    the head ranges over the data (or stub) of individual columns. If you had a squib

    tables as being an exercise in graphic design, some of us as a way to present
    data. They can do both, but one is primary. Guess which one I pick."

  body: "<cite>Uh, what\u2019s the diff?</cite>\r\n\r\nGood one. Ideally, there isn't
    any. \r\n\r\nWhen I go to the book show at the AAUP national meeting, I always
    spend more time with the rejects than with the selected books. You can learn a
    lot about the jurors that way. What you learn isn't always favorable. In a way,
    a good show is one where the \"not selected\" books do have some flaws, or at
    least, in some way aren't quite as good as those selected. There is always a judgement
    aspect, but I'm not talking about that.\r\n\r\nBe interesting to hear Kent Lew's
    reaction to being a juror at AAUP.\r\n\r\nA long time ago, I was a juror -- a
    smaller show, the Rocky Mountain Book Show. Some of the hardest work I ever did.
    The other (interior) juror was Rich Hendel. I'm proud that we almost completely
    saw eye to eye."
