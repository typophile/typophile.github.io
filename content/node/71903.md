  Plantin]] as the source font.\r\n\r\nInitially, I tried a number of weight variations
  before settling on one that I felt was most suitable. But it dawned on me that perhaps
  there may be some use in the alternatives when it came to displaying the logotype
  at different sizes. After all, typefaces are designed with multiple weights for
  just such occasions.\r\n\r\nIt may be complete overkill, and I realise I could be
  making more work for myself than necessary. But I was wondering if anyone had any
  experience or knowledge of logotypes, or rather 'families' of logotypes, that have
  slight variations in weight/thickness for different display resolutions.\r\n\r\nChris."

  body: "I should've mentioned that it's part of an identity design, rather than just
    a logo. I've come across a small number of corporate identity manuals, all to
    varying standards, so I'm fairly confident that I can deliver adequate content
    and instructions for use. Although that may not still be the case when (if) I
    move on to designing for larger companies. But thanks for the tip - I should definitely
    try and get hold of some more.\r\n\r\nThanks too for the link - just what I was
    after - it seems that most areas were covered in that thread. It's also good to
    know I've not just gone and asked a really daft question."

  body: "One problem with using multiple logo weights is that someone may accidentally
    use the \"small\" version in a large size and it looks way too heavy. On vice
    versa.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that it doubles the number of logos to keep track
    of. Most companies already have multiple versions of their logo -- a CMYK version,
    an RGB version, a version in PMS flat colors, a black-and-white version, versions
    with tag lines, versions without tag lines, etc., and if you do them in multiple
    weights then you've got to have 2 (or more) versions for each.\r\n\r\nNot trying
    to talk you out of it, but just be aware of the downside.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No matter what you do, someone will use the logo incorrectly. There is a
    99% chance that that someone is in the IT department and \"just needed to fit
    the logo in that footer\". They will use the wrong size logo with the wrong color
    scheme in a location it should never be located with not enough space around it,
    per the spec. \"The spec? What's that?\".\r\n\r\nI've seen this poor scenario
    played out at every large corporation I've been a designer at, from Nationwide
    to AOL to Fortune 500 financial services companies.\r\n\r\nI can't count on 10
    hands the number of times I've heard \"the logo doesn't work on the web\" only
    to find out the graphic designer gave a CMYK jpg reduced to 72 dpi to some poor
    unsuspecting .NET developer. I think it happens once a quarter :)\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    you should have a set of logos developed, but absolutely stick to the basics.
    Create specialized versions when the need arises so you can have the client use
    exactly what they need for exactly what they are trying to do."
