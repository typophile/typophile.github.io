body: "Hello everybody. I have a client (graphic designer) who is interested in the
  cyrillic version of one of Type-\xD8-Tones typefaces.\r\nWe proposed them to do
  custom work. As we are not russian or ukranians we will receive the help of a Russian
  type designer. \r\nMy question has to do with licences. What exactly has to cover
  my proposal? Only the development costs for \u201CCyrillization\u201D? or also the
  usage licences for their final client as well? If so, how many? If not, what would
  be the proportional costs for additional licensing of this font?\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate
  any help from you\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nLaura\r\n\r\n"

    version will be exclusive for that client, or whether you are going to make it
    available for the general public via Type-\xD8-Tones. "

    permission to extend their design. They should be the ones offered the Cyrillization
    work first. If they are not interested in doing, at least they should give you
    their blessing.\r\n\r\nJames"

    which\r\nactually happens to be something I wouldn't generally encourage. If it
    will\r\ninstead be an authentic Cyrillic design, there are many good reasons to,
    at\r\nmost, simply inform the original designer of what's happening. In this case\r\nthough
    this is moot since Laura is part of Type-\xD8-Tones.  :-)\r\n\r\nThe enrichment
    of a writing system should not\r\nbe held hostage, certainly not to somebody else's\r\ngreed
    or to some Modernist illusion.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW, \"Cyrillization\" (\"Cyrillification\"?)
    is a misleading term here.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
