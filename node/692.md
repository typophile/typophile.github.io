  body: yeah, this is really good work, but i would try it with 1 less pixel in the
    width of &#34;O&#34; and &#34;Q&#34;. i am not sure i can make the difference
    between V and Y. Their difference is just a singe pixel...<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13357.gif"

  body: I agree with Alex. I would make the O and Q 1 pixel less wide.  <BR>For the
    rest I really like it. You are the Pixel Wizard for me. Great job. <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: "I know this font/topic is way old, but I can't find this font anywhere online.
    It is perfect for a cell phone game I'm doing art assets for, but I can't even
    locate a download/purchase, not to mention a license for such use.\r\n\r\nMiguel,
    did you ever complete Arizona and Kuppa and make them available to the world at
    large? (I don't find them in your excellent collection at Atomic Media, though
    there are some clearly influenced there. In particular, I also love Tekilla.)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    they are both excellent bitmap fonts, and I'd love to have them available for
    use. Please let me know how/where to find them."
