  font people on here so I sure you can help...\r\n\r\nI'm building an icon font in
  FontLab Studio 5.1 and for the life of me I cannot get the font to show up in Microsoft
  Applications (Word, Powerpoint etc.). Shows up in every other professional app like
  Illustrator, InDesign... I read all the docs on Microsofts website pertaining to
  output when making a typeface by MS standards and I followed it perfectly (I think).
  \r\n\r\nDOES ANYONE KNOW THE TRICK TO GETTING CUSTOM FONTS TO SHOW UP IN MICROSOFT
  APPLICATIONS?\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone can lead me in the right direction...\r\n\r\nThanks
  a ton in advance :)\r\n"

    select the font in Word? If so, what do you type, and what do you see?\r\n\r\nIs
    it a Unicode or a Symbol font?"

  body: "It's literally not showing up at all? My experience is that Office 2011 is
    not keen on large numbers of fonts. A while back I had a huge number (thousands)
    installed and fonts kept randomly disappearing from the dropdown menu for no reason.
    If you think you have a lot of fonts that you rarely use on your machine, try
    deleting them and rebuilding the font database as per Microsoft's instructions.
    It worked fine for me once I'd trimmed things down. Also maybe try clearing out
    alternate builds: I once had a problem where I'd modded an [[http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/|open-source
    font]] to make the infant a and g characters default and the new version wouldn't
    show up as I hadn't changed the font info properly.  \r\n\r\nMicrosoft's take
    isn't entirely unfair, IMO. What they're effectively stating is that while they
    undertake to debug against system fonts supplied with OS X and the set supplied
    with Office, the onus is on a font designer to make their font work, not on Microsoft
    to find out why some font they've never heard of isn't working (the likely answer
    being because of a bug in it). It's a bit lame (and I would love if they actually
    undertook to fully implement the OpenType specification, seeing as they actually
    co-wrote it), but you can see their perspective."

    seems to be that at least for Office for Mac, you can have a font that installs
    ok, and appears in every program except Office. At that point, it's a Microsoft
    issue, yet they don't want to help. "

  body: Yes, Microsoft Office 2011 rejects fonts that work perfectly well at the system
    level and are fully compliant with the various font standards, and worked fine
    in previous versions of Office. It's not amusing.
