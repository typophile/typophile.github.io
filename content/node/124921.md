body: "Hello, everyone:\r\n\r\nLong time no see! I hope everyone is doing well. \r\n\r\nI've
  noticed some things about Georgia. Forgive me if this is owing to my lack of technical
  knowledge. I'm anticipating an obvious answer.\r\n\r\n1. Georgia in OS X Yosemite
  is at version 5.00x-4. That's a strange version number. Georgia in Windows 8.1 is
  at version 5.50 (or 5.51.) Why the difference in terms of the \"x-4\" at the end
  of the one that ships with OS X? Is it some \"special\" version for OS X? Isn't
  Georgia supposed to be the same, interchangeable cross-platform font?\r\n\r\nThe
  latest version that comes bundled with operating systems is the one in Windows 8.1,
  which is 5.51. Should I be using that instead (since it's newer?)\r\n\r\n2. When
  I open Georgia 5.00x-4 in Glyphs, it indicates no kerning pairs. Fine. I heard that
  Georgia didn't ship with any kerning pairs. However, when I open Georgia 5.51 (that
  came with Windows) in Glyphs, it shows over five thousand pairs. \r\n\r\nWhen I
  open either of them in, say, Textedit, and turn kerning off and on, neither version
  kerns. \r\n\r\nThere is a similar phenomenon with Verdana. However, both the OS
  X and Windows \"versions\" kern just fine. \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some clarification.
  \r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "On the subject of Verdana, I'll also add that the latest version that ships
    with Windows renders differently in Safari when installed on OS X (it looks oddly
    large and unpleasant), than the latest version that ships with OS X, also rendered
    in Safari on OS X (it looks more smooth and uniform.)\r\n\r\nIt would appear than
    I'm better off using whatever came (custom-tailored?) with my OS. "

  body: "Basically, the differences come mainly down to the Tables, Rendering, and
    Character Sets. \r\n\r\nMac OSX renders fonts differently than Windows or Linux
    do, and Windows has Cleartype, which is both liked and disliked by many.\r\n\r\nMac
    versions are often customized (for Apple) to include an Apple Logo character that
    is exclusive to Mac versions, and they can have some differences in other included
    characters.\r\n\r\nApple's AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) includes unique tables
    that are not used by any non-Apple OS, (and is the rendering system according
    to Wikipedia, so hopefully it is correct). AAT is an Extension of the TrueType
    technology, which has tables that allow many OpenType like Features in TrueType."
