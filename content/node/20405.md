  body: "The unbracketed serifs mixed with some brackets ('s') make it a stumper and
    a good candidate for a custom design. It feels like someone wanted to update Century
    Schoolbook by removing the brackets and did a pretty good job.\r\n\r\nIt might
    help to know the source. Is this a magazine, andres?"

  body: Although not the case, this almost looks as if someone set a, e, s in Century
    Schoolbook and L, k in Boton or Serifa and then proceeded to customise the forms
    in an attempt to synchronise the two faces... without sucess, L and k just sticks
    out like a sore thumb.

    going insane trying to find it. Oh well. "
