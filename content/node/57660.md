    might be others, but based on what I can see in the sample, these are my guesses.
    Century is the top sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/century_os_full_3416.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/bruceoldstyle_bt_full_4469.gif]"

  body: "I was thinking it should be a metal type in order to be pressed into the
    card that way. I was looking for typefaces that would still be fairly common in
    metal. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Closest I could find is Century Old Style, but it's lacking some characteristics
    that Hoefler Text has as well.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like this was done from plates
    rather than handset, so it could be anything."
