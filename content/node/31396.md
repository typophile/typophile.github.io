  together a piece on Vince Sardi, who passed away last month. (You Manhattanites
  and tourists to Manhattan surely have heard of Sardi's?)\r\n\r\nI keep coming across
  that he was very supportive of this group. I think they have something to do with
  car racing - but I also know that he was very much involved in the world of theater?\r\n\r\nI
  was hoping there was a typographer around who has that piece of trivia and would
  share... hey, I'd do the same... it was amazing how much info one could pick up
  at a type shop. (Trying to bring it back to topic :-)\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance
  for your help.\r\n\r\nand of course, RIP Vince..."
