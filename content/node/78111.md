  writing/comparative lit at Ohio State University posted using an emoticon as an
  ending paren.\r\nAs in her quip:\r\n<em>\"OK, I hereby declare myself in charge
  of deciding how to punctuate using a parenthetical emoticon: said emoticon WILL
  do double-duty as a close-parenthesis. (And that is the last word on that subject
  :)\"</em>\r\n\r\nHmmmm... Whaddaya think? It <strong>is</strong> economical. (This
  is certainly a case for the Typophiles :-)"

    will use both period and colon, like this I.T., not a beauty, but clashing punctuation
    rarely is, but at least there isn\u2019t a repetition like )) or .. (the latter
    case particularly unwanted, since it could be mistaken for an unborn ellypsis)."
