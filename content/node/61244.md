body: "Irma is a capital-only display typeface in 9 weights that is available in simple
  Sans & geometric Slab. Inspired by the principles of the Arabic alphabet, Irma provides
  different conditional letterforms, depending on whether characters occur at the
  beginning, middle, or the end of the word. Letters can have four different forms
  (initial, medial, final and isolated). The choice of these forms is controlled by
  a OpenType feature (Stylistic Set 1), which allows creation of typographic patterns
  using the negative spaces of the letterforms.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/news/new_font_release_irma\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma_slab\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/IrmaStd.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/irma_sans_6025.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/irma_slab_typophile_5411.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Irma_specials_5269.png]\r\n\r\n"

    the connection, \"Aida\" would've been my choice.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The knock-out version is, er, a knock-out!\r\n\r\nQuite a few OpenType Script
    fonts, in the Latin alphabet, already have contextual alternates dependent on
    word-position, so I would say this is something that may be suggested by cursive
    scripts in general, not just Arabic--but developing it into negative space is
    a very clever invention."

  body: "Well, Fimi is a Near Eastern girl's name; it's short for something,\r\nbut
    I forget what. Aida is cool because -in Arabic- it includes two\r\nvery Arabic
    sounds: a 'ain and a hamza. Plus it's an opera. I saw it\r\nin Rome as a kid,
    and I remember one thing from it: they brought\r\nout real camels on stage!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I am interested by your decision not to do overshoots for the round letters.
    You don't think it's a problem? Or you think that the benefit of stacking is more
    important?

  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\n@skolato\r\nWe are considering Cyrillic (since most of our
    fonts have Cyrillic support), but it is to a high priority at the moment. We'll
    see how will Irma do.\r\n\r\n@William Berkson\r\nI have designed this typeface
    for a logo originally (http://www.steppinggrounds.com/) and I was annoyed by large
    overshoots even in Display typefaces. Yes you need them in smaller sizes, but
    not having them allows creating typographic layouts impossible to make with overshoots.
    Just look at how the logo used on that website, it works much better without them.
    \r\n\r\nI was thinking of these kind of applications too (http://www.flickr.com/photos/typotheque/3871608837/)
    Again, only possible if no overshoots are used."
