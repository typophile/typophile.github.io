  what it is now and when was this done?\r\nI was also wondering are there any diffrerences
  beween Old English by Elsner & Flake and Old English by Linotype Library. Is there
  an \"official\" version?\r\n"

  body: I think "Best Text Black" and "Rare Text Black" appear to be in that same
    typeface design, becoming the two names of that same new/exclusive typeface from
    SoftMaker, a heavyweight version of "Engravers Old English" with the uppercase
    letters "H" and "K" and the lowercase letters "y" and "z" appearing in altered
    glyph forms that look similar to Cloister Black, another Old English-related Blackletter
    typeface.     "Best Text Black" appears to have two styles with one layout each
    ("Regular/Original" and "DFR/German Fraktur"), just like most Blackletter fonts
    that are either revivals of URW++ and "Berthold"-related designs or some new exclusive
    typeface designs.    "Rare Text Black" was just like some Blackletter typefaces
    that are either revivals of Brendel and "Linotype/Adobe"-related designs or a
    fewer exclusive typeface designs, comes in "Regular/Original" layout only (no
    "DFR/German Fraktur" layout).    Both font names are appearing on two premium-quality
    typeface collections from SoftMaker - "infiniType 4" for designers and "MegaFont
    XXL 3.0" for home users - both being released in May 27, 2014.

  body: '"E780 Blackletter" (an exact clone of Engravers Old English ATF, numbered
    from English Gravure) is finally coming in all 4 styles - Regular, Dfr, Bold &
    Bold-Dfr.    The font itself appears to have the uppercase letter "H" finally
    being updated for the style of "regular" in two layouts - Regular/Original and
    DFR/German Fraktur - and that''ll look exactly like Monotype''s "Engravers Old
    English"; this font is appearing on two premium-quality typeface collections from
    SoftMaker - "MegaFont XXL 3.0" (for home users) and "infiniType 4" (for designers),
    both being released around May 27, 2014.'

  body: "According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally having an update on Blackletter
    typefaces, splitting up most Blackletter typefaces to include 2 layouts each:
    \"Regular\" (Original) and \"DFR\" (German Fraktur), but some Blackletter typefaces
    only have the original layout, no German Fraktur.\r\n\r\nThe following Blackletter
    typefaces in the layouts of \"Regular\" (Original) and \"DFR\" (German Fraktur)
    are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\"Alte Schwabacher\" - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"C652 Blackletter\"
    (Caslon Gotisch) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"E780 Blackletter\" (Engravers Old English,
    ATF) - 4 styles (including Regular & Bold, each with 2 layouts)\r\n\u2022\t\"Fraktur\"
    (Fette Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Gotisch\" (Fette Gotisch) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Goudy
    Text\" - 4 styles (including Regular & Lombardic Caps, each with 2 layouts)\r\n\u2022\t\"J790
    Blackletter\" (Unger Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"L750 Blackletter\" (London
    Text) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Marriage\" (Mariage) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Old
    Blackletter\" (Old English Text, Monotype) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"P790 Blackletter\"
    (Poppl-Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Rundgotisch\" (Weiss Rundgotisch) - 2
    styles\r\n\u2022\t\"W650 Blackletter\" (Walbaum Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"W722
    Blackletter\" (Wilhelm-Klingspor Gotisch) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Z690 Blackletter\"
    (Zentenar Fraktur) - 4 styles (including Regular & Bold, each with 2 layouts)\r\n\r\nThe
    following \"original layout\"-only Blackletter typefaces are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\"American
    Text\"\r\n\u2022\t\"F692 Blackletter\" (Fette Fraktur)\r\n\u2022\t\"G820 Blackletter\"
    (Gregorian)\r\n\u2022\t\"Gothic\" (Weiss Gotisch)\r\n\u2022\t\"Light Text\" (Linotype
    Text/Linotext)\r\n\u2022\t\"Ottoman\" (Old English Text, Monotype)\r\n\u2022\t\"P650
    Blackletter\" (Paladin)\r\n\r\nAnd yet, exclusive Blackletter typeface designs
    include most with two layouts (Regular & Dfr), and some with the layout of \"original\"
    only, no German Fraktur.   These fonts are finally appearing on two of SoftMaker's
    premium-quality typeface collections - \"MegaFont XXL 3.0\" for home users, and
    \"infiniType 4\" for designers - both being released around May 27, 2014."

  body: "If you look at the Linotype page for Old English (http://www.linotype.com/11949/oldenglish-font.html),
    you'll notice that its dscription says that it was designed by Monotype. So, this
    design came to us by way of them. I suspect that E+F's version was licensed from
    Monotype, too. Orm they may have digitized their own version of a similar pre-digital
    face, in which case they would have there own.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you could
    license the face from whichever company you prefer to get your fonts from. I'm
    sure that they are all good fonts.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    to Morris Benton at ATF in 1901. There were many others that followed: Intertype,
    BB&S, more ATF, Ludlow, more ATF, Monotype. It was known as Engravers Old English,
    Engravers Old Black, etc. Likely the worst interpretation of blackletter ever
    to grace the planet.\r\n\r\nGerald"
