    American Uncial is fine; I just don&#39;t like  <BR>calligraphy fonts that much.
    I can&#39;t get over the random,  <BR>free shapes repeated over and over mechanically.
    It seems  <BR>like an oxymoron to me. Maybe as OpenType takes off they  <BR>will
    get better. <BR> <BR>Here is another PDF. I added some Roman Upper and Lower  <BR>case.
    The idea is that you can make it as uncial or not uncial  <BR>as you want. It&#39;s
    still rough; there are some weight issues  <BR>and some lumpy curves. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

    for a unical font either. It would be a nice alternative in places where I&#39;ve
    seen <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMasSaR.html">Mason Sans
    &amp; Serif</a> used. For <a href="http://www.artemisfowl.com/">example</a>. But
    this works much better in text situations. I bet you&#39;d see a bundle of computer

  body: 'The average graphic designer in general is very superficial in the use of
    type. That&#39;s why in the end they always end up using faces mostly for logotypes
    or to achieve a quick emotional effect. Many Emigre designs, abused as they are,
    aren&#39;t used at all in their full potential. Of course, overtly decorated letters
    dont&#39; leave so much space for the typographer, but I&#39;m sure interesting
    experiments &#40;benefitting from OpenType, which is all to discover&#41; like
    the one from Christian, here, will be overlooked and will make more the joy of
    type addicts and collectors instead of being used in actual interesting ways.
    <BR>It&#39;s not to be pessimistic, but people tend to be very superficial, especially
    with historically inspired designs. <BR> <BR>Christian, did you really designed
    the first lowercases in a single night? If so, I&#39;m just saddened to death
    &#40;and very glad for you!&#41;: sometimes it takes me a whole afternoon to fix
    just a few letters...'

    when somebody creates a painting, or a building, it is what it is, there is no

    mean mere letterforms&#41; that will never all be used by one person. Just the
    simple act of determining the right sidebearing of the &#34;r&#34; is more than

    It may rather be that the curve into the stem is too steep &#40;compare it with
    the curve on c, g, e&#41; giving d the appearance of a rather small o with a stem.
    <BR> <BR>I think the superscript 1 may be a bit big &#40;noticeable in the fractions&#41;.
    To my taste the os 3 is rather wide &#40;especially compared to the 5, which is
    admirably narrow&#41;. But this may just be me: the modern taste in os figs often
    seems to me to produce rather overemphatic 3s.'
