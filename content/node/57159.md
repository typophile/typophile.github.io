  any of you come across it? I would be really grateful for answers. I found a font
  for PC, but that doesn't work for the project. Thanks! Marianne

  body: I'm not sure what you mean by a feng shui font, but if you just need the Chinese
    characters used in feng shui, you just need a font that supports Chinese (simplified
    or traditional as desired). If you need the <em>ba gua</em> symbols, then I think
    many fonts include them as symbols, especially East Asian ones. Japanese fonts
    are a good bet. There really should be no need to get a dedicated feng shui font,
    whatever that is.
