body: I'm really a newb when it comes to typography but I believe this typo is handwritten.
  Is there something out there remotely similar to "Kenichi"? And also what font is
  the city names in?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kenichi_3512.png.jpg]

  body: "The KENICHI lettering looks hand-drawn as you guessed, but you can find many
    similar styles by looking for childrens lettering fonts, or brush-drawn fonts.\r\n\r\nThe
    place names sans at the bottom is too small to see well, but the high M crotch
    is not too common. If you could describe the G it might be easier to guess some
    possibilities.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
