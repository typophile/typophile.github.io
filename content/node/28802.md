  body: "<em>we cannot afford to pay $35</em>\r\n\r\nSo, I assume that you are posting
    this message at the public library (no DSL or cable connection, right?), and you
    don't have a cell phone or cable TV, never visit Starbucks or go to a movie, don't
    subscribe to any magazines, and don't have an iPod (or at least not any tunes
    for it), right?"

    body: "I am sorry, but I said SORRY. I should have explained my situation. But
      I didn't think it was necessary.\r\nThe situation is that we are offering a
      proof for the prospective to buy our product, and at this point we really don't
      want to spend any money on it, because we might not get an P.O. It is just like
      a spot job situation. \r\nAnd I do not own iPod nor go to Starbucks.\r\nSorry
      if I upset you."

  body: So, what you want to do is to make a DUMMY, which is simple enough. Simply
    go <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/regular/"
    target="_blank">here</a>, and type your copy into the type tester. You can then
    save the image or print the screen, and insert that image, properly cropped, into
    your presentation. Yes, the image will be only 72 or 96 dpi (depending on your
    OS), but you can advise your potential client that it is "for position and general
    look" only. If/when you get the job...BUY the font (or another version thereof).

  body: "Misa - The original, predigital Quaint Gothic (AKA Desdemona Solid) didn't
    have a lowercase. Jim Spiece created those characters himself. So, you aren't
    going to find another version like that.\r\n\r\nNick's idea sounds good, no.\r\n\r\nThe
    only thing kind of close that comes to mind still isn't free, but it's cheaper.
    That would be Ray Larabie's revival from roughly the same period, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/silentina/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Silentina</a>."

    always get the job done, no sweat. ;^)
