  body: I found the preceding article also interesting as well. And I have learned
    something new today too; a few days back, I learned that the most popular typeface
    for Hebrew is Frank Ruhl; now, I've learned that the traditional typeface for
    Armenian is Barz.

  body: I see I didn't learn what I thought I learned. Barz was the emphasized "different"
    face, not the one most of the text in the picture was in.

  body: "No, Barz is the body text in that image. The other one is Aramian. BTW in
    formal transliteration it's \"Parz\", but phonetically that doesn't make sense
    (because we have a \"pure\" \"p\" sound that's another letter).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Ah. Then something is strange, because I did a web search for Barz, and found
    many purported examples of it, but they all looked like what you are saying is
    Aramian. I will just search more carefully.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, finally, I saw
    on the Monotype site that indeed Barz is the face I was thinking of, even though
    several sites are offering upright faces called \"Barz\" or even \"Parz\". But
    part of the problem is my own faulty memory; I thought I had seen Armenian typically
    printed with a Barz-like face, but in which, somewhat reminiscent of Porson Greek,
    the capital letters were upright and not italicized.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my memories
    of seeing recent Armenian printing had faded, and were distorted by things like
    Caslon's specimen."

  body: "> offering upright faces called \"Barz\"\r\n\r\nWell, some digital designers
    have given the slanting job to the Italic button :-/ thinking that way they're
    getting an upright font* for free (plus it's easier to make upright stuff). But
    Barz looks very wrong when it's upright.\r\n\r\n* Supposedly more sensical/useful
    BTW. Bogus.\r\n\r\n> the capital letters were upright and not italicized.\r\n\r\nSome
    were like that, yes. And some had the caps inclined but visibly less than the
    lc (like 15 vs 20 degrees). Some old Latin fonts (like some Garamonds come to
    mind) were like this too.\r\n\r\nFor anybody who's curious here's the image we
    were talking about above:\r\nhttp://armenotype.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Barz-plus.jpg\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I just took a look at the 1912 American Specimen Book of Type Styles, and
    in there, on page 877, the 10 point Armenian was all in italics, and the 14 point
    Armenian had upright uppercase and italic lowercase.

  body: I can confirm the "still extant". Doing a Google search on "Mekhitarist",
    to see if any more of that specimen was out there... I found advertisements for
    a summer camp run by the Mekhitarist order in New York State prominent among my
    search results.

    from Venice proper (a trip I took during our honeymoon). As surreal as Venice
    is, that place is doubly so.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I also went to San Lazzaro when I was last in Venice (coincidentally, also
    on my honeymoon). It is indeed an extraordinary place. Unfortunately, the monks
    do not do their own printing any more, although they are still involved in publishing,
    and got rid of all their old type and presses some time ago. Although the monastery
    forms a kind of living museum and library of Armenian culture, apparently they
    didn't consider the fascination that a museum of Armenian printing history might
    have held for some of us. And I guess they needed the space for the new computers.

  body: Sadly, Armenia isn't big enough for its economy to support a Smithsonian institution
    to which the monks could have shipped their old presses and type (by water, of
    course)... but, who knows, maybe there <em>is</em> a museum of Armenian printing
    history somewhere in Italy, just not on within the limited space of San Lazzaro.
    Not likely, but one can dream.
