  I have changed font management tools so many times that, if anything, I'm only about
  to cause myself more heartache. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPeople keep saying how fast it is.
  so, how fast is it? how stable is it. has anyone been using font agent pro and switched
  and laughed out loud at the improvement?\r\n</p><p>\r\nI grew up on ATM. I've used
  Suitcase, Masterjuggler, Font Reserve and even tried to work with Font Book. \r\n</p><p>\r\nYes,
  I still miss ATM. Kinda sad really. I don't miss the UI.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTypographica
  has a thread. I know that already. I just want to hear from users of FE/X and there
  likes and dislikes. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI'm using my blog because I am also sick to death
  of threads asking about font management. \r\n</p><p>\r\n=^&gt;\r\n</p><p>\r\n[update:
  as of last Friday I am quite happily using FontExplorer X. You can <em>slowly</em>
  train the applications to not ask for the fonts.]\r\n</p>"

    with it. My rule with new software(s) and upgrade(s):  wait couple months, see
    -hear-read about the main bugs and then download/upgrade.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm
    happy with FontBook, however, I want to use FE/X. But as I said, I'm going to
    wait. "

  body: I have been using it & have had some bugs. It does ask if you want to buy
    fonts a bit too much. Some of the drag & drop features I was expecting because
    it is built around the itunes concerpt doesn't seem to work - it isn't written
    into it (yet?). I can't compare it with the latest suitcase master juggler etc.
    because I didn't use them. Still, so far I am pretty happy & I have a sense that
    if I got better organized in it then all would be well.

  body: The ability to create smart sets is what really sold me on it. The Auto-ligatures
    check box will come in helpful. I've never been asked to buy a font for some reason.
    On the downside I am not able to view fonts  at 8pt or smaller on screen, it's
    completely illegible. Other than that I love it and it's going to replace Suitcase
    on my machine!

  body: Can you explain smart sets for me? (Not that it matters at this point as I'm
    still hoping/waiting for a PC version of FE. I'm quite happy with Suitcase 9 for
    PC as it does what I need it to do [I haven't experienced any of the "slow" issues
    others have mentioned and it has never crashed on me], but I'm very eager for
    something on PC that will auto-activate. At the moment there's nothing available
    with that ability.)

  body: "Smart Sets are dynamic font sets.\r\n\r\nIn a font, you have a wealth of
    information. Aside from the font name itself, you have a copyright and trademark
    string embedded. Many OpenType fonts have designer names embedded, foundry name
    embedded, distributor embedded, even a font description embedded, production year,
    etc.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a Smart Set, click on \"New Smart Set\" first. Lets
    name this first set \"Adobe Fonts.\" Using the pull down menus, tell the set to
    include any font whose copyright string contains the word Adobe. All Adobe fonts
    will now also be displayed in a Smart Set folder. Every time a new Adobe font
    is installed, it will appear in this folder as well.\r\n\r\nAnything could go
    into a Smart set, really. All Italics. Or all Expert fonts. Or all fonts designed
    by Robert Slimbach.\r\n\r\nSince every font in FontExplorer X has its own comment
    field, you can also make smart sets based on your own comments. Lets say that
    one of your comments is \"single storey a.\" Then you could have a Single Storey
    A smart set, too.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can give fonts a rating, just like you can
    rate songs in iTunes. Ratings can be a Smart Set criterion as well."

  body: "One sweet thing about it - It seems to be able to preview some open type
    features such as contextual replacement ( calt ). I am working on a face that
    uses this feature so that's pretty fine for me!\r\n\r\nI haven't tested any others.
    Dan, Any idea what OT features Font Explorer can show? On OS X is the feature
    I have been seeing ( calt ) being rendered via  FE or OSX? Thanks!\r\n"

  body: When does it ask you if you want to buy fonts? I suppose this is one reason
    I'm hesitant. Although, it is not a major reason. Something this good, from what
    I hear anyway, which is free shouldn't get complaints like that.

    necessary? That could be a stupid question.

  body: This is how they are able to offer it for free. Do you think Linotype is just
    providing it for free out of the goodness of their hearts? It's more like iTunes
    than people seem to realize.

  body: "I like it anyway. You are under no obligation to buy fonts with it, but that
    possibility is why it's free. Seems like a good deal to me. Font Reserve had (has?)
    a \"buy font\" facility something like it connected with MyFonts, but it was not
    as well implemented. Plus, Font Reserve isn't free, so it's sort of like having
    to sit through ads after paying for a movie at a theater.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    Linotype was courting smaller foundries regarding FEX at TypeCon last summer.
    Maybe my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. :-)"
