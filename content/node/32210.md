  quite a dark little movie about dual existence.\r\nThought it would be nice to homage
  the dead zone\r\nBut can't remember what the typeface is...\r\nis it Ironwood? the
  serifs should be a give away.\r\n\r\nAlso any other similar recommendations would
  be very welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nMr Brown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dead-zone-grab_6558.jpg]"

      know if I was looking for suggestions on a similar or decent typeface for a
      project,\r\nshould I post in this forum.\r\n\r\ncheers very much.\r\nImagine
      how much money letraset would make if they re-drew the faces from the old catalogues...\r\n\r\nMr
      Borwn"
