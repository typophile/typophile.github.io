  body: "Very nice. I would make the underlined text in the gray bar on the right,
    bold instead, perhaps the same font you used on the right in dark gray. There
    are no other underlines in the resume, the line under the name isn't an underline.\r\n\r\nThe
    language and computer skills seem to almost be bullet points but since they aren't
    I would use commas on them.\r\n\r\nSkills and Interest shouldn't be centered,
    all the text on the right should line up (left), even the stuff in the gray with
    its padding.\r\n\r\nI think the rest is very solid."

  body: "\u2022 Lose the underlines. If you really want this effect, use rules set
    farther from the letters and with a weight that relates to the letters.\r\n\u2022
    Put dashes in date ranges, not hyphens.\r\n\u2022 Track out those tight capital
    settings.\r\n\u2022 Fix the rule sticking up next to \u201CREFEREE\u201D\r\n\u2022
    Don\u2019t use quotes around the word spin\r\n\u2022 HTML/CSS is not a language
    skill\r\n\u2022\_Use semibold for the grey bold subheads."

  body: "The size relationships within your type hierarchy looks odd to me. Very clunky
    and amateurish.\r\n\r\nYour name at the top is too big. The all caps section heads
    are also too big as are the main titles of your employment history.\r\n\r\nEverything
    seems a bit loud, as if it is talking too loudly for the room. Also all of that
    sans serif type gets a bit boring. No contrast."

  body: "DR,\r\n\r\nas one who was born into the big media -- the whole thing so called
    layout, hierarchy, typography, the right font etc etc etc is really nonesense,
    s**t; the HR guys don't have time to deal with that stuff!\r\n\r\nconcentrate
    on your strengths, skills; e.g Have edited countless documents... -- 'countless'
    is not right.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood luck!"
