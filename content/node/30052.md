body: "hello all,\r\n\r\ni am creating a logo for a guy who builds high quality african
  drums.\r\nfor those who know more, they are called djembes and dununs.\r\n\r\nmy
  first samples for him included more \"african\" fonts, bolder and more playful.\r\n\r\nhe
  really likes the Trajan and wants to go with a font like the Trajan.\r\n\r\nMy Questions
  to you:\r\n\r\nA) What is your overall impression if you see these logos? Does it
  look like high-quality drums? does it still look like he is selling affordable drums?
  do you think it needs a more \"african/ethnic\" touch?\r\n\r\nB) Which version do
  you like best?\r\n\r\nC) Any suggestions for another font and general comments.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Anke\r\n\r\nReading your post I was thinking '...ohhh this will be another
    job set in Neuland', so I'm happy to see otherwise on the samples. Trajan has
    a historical 'high-quality' association in the West, and maybe in other parts
    too, so it's a good pick on your clients' part. It appears to me that the brush
    drawn illustration is trying to do two things at the same time \u2013 be approachable/good
    value <em>and</em> be upmarket. My advice is to settle for one or the other.\r\n\r\nI
    prefer version A for the relationships between the image and the type.\r\n\r\nYou
    really don't need to hyphenate 'custom-drums' (the fact that they are custom,
    and that there are many of them, will stand as it is, with only a wordspace between
    the two).\r\n\r\nNote that you can always get titling capitals to look classier
    (and therefore more upmarket) by letterspacing generously."

  body: "I like the drum from version A better than the one from version B. The drawing
    is a little less rigid-looking.\r\n\r\nI'd increase the white around the bottom
    of the 'J' (where it overlaps the drum) just a little bit. Remember that if this
    logo is reproduced in one-colour at a small size (say in a faxed letterhead) the
    'J' may become one with the drum. I'd also recommend creating a second version
    of the logo without the subtitle for this kind of purpose.\r\n\r\nI second Ben's
    suggestion to dehyphenate \"custom drums\".\r\n\r\nOverall, it looks very clean
    and connotes \"high quality\" to me. Good job.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I like them! I think that your drum logo in A is terrific -- B is still good,
    but A and C have more flowing and therefore musical feels to them. The abstractness
    of the drum shape makes it seem like your client got someone to design the logo
    for him (which he did), which suggests that he has high-quality products.\r\n\r\nI
    think that the illustration is strong enought to convey the message regardless
    of the typography (although I can scarcely believe that I'm saying this, especially
    here). That said, I'm not sure if Trajan is a great match -- Trajan connotes Roman
    statues, not African music. I'd think that a modern, <em>flowing</em> sans-serif
    might work better, to combine with the clean, sleek lines of the drum. But if
    the client is set on Trajan, as Ben and Lex said, it still looks quite elegant
    and different."

    body: "THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPINIONS! it definitely helped a bit and i  feel clearer
      about what i did. i will continue tweak around with font, kerning and form,
      although i think i am pretty close to the final version.\r\n\r\n@auricfuzz:
      the original drawing from him (and he did it by himself) looked kind of like
      a wine glass, see samples (only the drum drawing is from him): http://www.cokomanie.de/fontsamples1.gif
      \ (not MY homepage btw.)\r\nthis is one of the first version, were i also used
      a more \"ethnic\" font, or however you wanna call that kind.\r\n\r\ni changed
      the form to what it is now, which is the drumshell of a certain african drum
      (bamena-shell), so it doesn't look like a wine glass anymore.\r\n\r\ni kind
      of like that font more, because it's warmer, but it definitely looks less \"upmarket\",
      and not so professional i guess. and he wants to go with sth. like trajan.\r\n\r\nANYWAY,
      thanks again and feel free to post more comments :-)\r\n"

        think through a paper like that it fits into the subject of drums, made of

        of an african drum group. \r\n\r\nsubtitle font is FF Kievit.\r\n\r\nafter

  body: "I'm actually not a huge fan of either Trajan or the old \"ethnic\" font --
    Trajan seems more appropriate for a wine bottle or movie poster and the sans seems
    too wiggly, suggesting more a toy store than anything else. I do like the illustrations
    you did on the capital letters, although in the end it might prove to be an unnecessary
    extra flourish.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to go somewhere more in the middle. A
    humanist sans-serif, maybe one based on a seriffed roman (like StormType's <a
    href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-sans/>John Sans</a> and <a href=http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-58-amor-sans>Amor
    Sans</a>, although those aren't great for your project -- maybe someone more familiar
    with humanist sans-serifs could help out?) would be good, combining the new with
    the old. But I think any fun, humanist sans-serif (but not too whimsical a sans)
    could be perfect. However, as I mentioned, Trajan is fine if it has to stay."

  body: "For your business card I would consider centring the type on the JebeBara
    side and have the drum illustration hanging off to the left. On the reverse I
    would drop the zigzag and knockback drum and some of the drummers, the zigzag
    could cause problems to the printer when it comes to trimming and doesn't seriously
    add to the design, however if you needed/wanted to keep it consider moving it
    away from the edge, the knockback drum also doesn't add to the design, while your
    logo is a combination of brush illustration and elegant type the reverse is a
    little overpopulated, the illustrations are charming, however, some of them look
    a little like drafts for the others and one of them looks like a banjo player,
    while the central figure resembles a butler, stiff posture and not as fluid as
    the others. Finally why print the texture and not use a proper textured stock?\r\nTim"

    helped and i am glad forums like that exist and help junior designers improve
    their work.\r\n\r\n@timd\r\nthat was actually the plan, i wouldn't print the background,
    it is just to simulate the paper. i would go with a stock that really looks like
    recycled very natural paper, without any background color printed on it.\r\ni
    kind of like the zickzack, since this gives the design a little more of an african
    touch. \r\nyou are right, it could cause problems with trimming, i'll try other
    options.\r\n\r\n@auricfuzz\r\ni'll have a look into the fonts you proposed :-)\r\n\r\na."

  body: You can take a look at the fonts I proposed, but I didn't think either them
    were actually especially appropriate for your design -- but the <em>type</em>
    of font (a sans-serif created from a serif) is. I can't quite remember any others,
    but maybe someone else can help out. If you like the concept, you might want to
    poke around the forums to see if you can find some.

    body: Hi - i'm trying to find someone to create a logo for me. I like the clean
      lines of this djembe.  I want something very simple with the outline of a drummer
      playing the djembe and a dancer dancing in front of him and the name of our
      group Samato. I can find photo to show the idea, but i want it very simple and
      clean. I can't afford a lot, but am willing to pay.
