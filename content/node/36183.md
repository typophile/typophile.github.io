  body: "Most any major brand will have the same % chance of failure or not. I love
    laCie drives, but I had one crap out on me last year, so I've kept my eyes open
    to other brands -- I haven't given up on laCie, but i've got a LOT of their drives,
    so the odds just caught up with me. I have talked to one tech (who worked on my
    drive's recovery) who said he (and his co-workers) were leery of laCie because
    they don't include enough ventilation, so they get pretty hot (specifically their
    larger 4-drive mechanism enclosures, th bigger disk and extreme disk cases).\r\n\r\nBasically,
    you should be looking at \r\na) capacity/form factor (how much will it store in
    how many drives... some 500 GB drives actually have two 250 GB mechanisms inside,
    that's twice the chance to fail); \r\nb) Warranty/track record (is it a fly-by-night
    upstart or a known name like laCie or Wester Digital)\r\nc) Interface (Firewire
    800, 400, USB 2.0 or 1.1, etc) - the faster the interface, the faster the throughput
    (usually)\r\n\r\nFinally, you can save $$ by checking for deals - drives are getting
    faster/bigger/cheaper every month, it seems. I just got an email from MacMall,
    they're selling the laCie d2 Quadra 500GB for only $189 (good price for a laCie).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "All you can know about any harddrive is that it will fail. The question is
    when. It could fail instantly or never, or at any time in between. I use the LaCie
    d2 drives because they are mechanically solid, and the interfaces are reliable,
    fast, quiet, and very compatible. That's all you can hope for when you buy an
    external harddrive.\r\n\r\nI just had a 250GB LaCie d2 drive fail, but I have
    a solid BACK-UP strategy that is actually working, so that event was expected
    and trivial."

  body: "There's a lot to say about HDD\u2019s, eg that the \u2018big brands\u2019
    use drives from different manufacturers in their enclosures and are not really
    open about what they use.\r\nFor almost fifteen years I bought and used LaCie
    equipment until one drive gave up on me (apparently because of a bad powerbrick).
    After this I changed policy: I kept up with testreports in magazines (in my case
    German ones are favoured because they are so thorough), bought the best drives
    recommended, and put them in top brand enclosures.\r\nI always backed up twice,
    to two separate drives. And I burned DVD's of all the data I could not reconstruct
    (with two copies of each backup-DVD).\r\nNowadays I'm on an extended sabbatical,
    but I plan to go back to work soon. When I do, I will go for the safest way of
    backing up: use a redundant Raid-array, make DVD-backups and put compressed files
    on the Internet (storage is cheap nowadays \u2014 and I plan on using Google as
    well as DotMac).\r\n___\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
