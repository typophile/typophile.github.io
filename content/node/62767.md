    Symbol]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/alexon-rr/|Alexon]] by
    Les Usherwood. There are a number of these tinyserif (MyFonts keyword) fonts.
    These two looked closest to me. They may have been manipulated graphically too.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "The left-slanted serif, seems to be a normal serif with the O and M graphically
    backslanted. I don't think that's the way the font was designed. I couldn't identify
    the serif offhand though. The longer baseline leg of the E should be a good clue.\r\n\r\n\r\n-
