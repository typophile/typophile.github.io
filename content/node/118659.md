  Any ideas?

  body: Thanks for the better sample. Still can't identify it positively. List from
    my previous post still valid. Adding [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/intention|Intention]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/radiant|Radiant]]. What I could say for sure
    is it has been customized (don't know any font with such a crossbar-less /A).
