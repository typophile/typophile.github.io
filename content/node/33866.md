    your intentions, many people here who might know what font\r\nthat is are less
    likely to tell you.\r\n\r\nTry to spend money on fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    fonts are offered free, and quite a few vendors do, what's wrong abot using them?
    \r\n\r\nI really feeel it should be appreciated that in markets less affluent
    then the west, purchasing fonts at Western prices is just beyond the economics
    of most graphic design projects. \r\n\r\nLet me clarify that I'm not condoning
    use of pirated fonts here. Or undervaluing the type designers work.  "

  body: "Interesting concept Hrant. \r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to offer variable
    prices for markets. Local editions of the same books, music, designerwear, and
    of late, stock images are priced lower in developing markets, than in the west.
    Of course in some of those cases the lower prices are partly enabled by local
    production. Still, lower prices are a great way to start making people accept
    the idea of purchasing a font. "
