  they don't tell you what it is!\r\n\r\nAnybody know? Here's a large pic.\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XYiLrMURRG0/S3R2j1Yi1BI/AAAAAAAACDI/rgrhIQvrmgk/s1600-h/Hopworks+sign.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  finishing dinner there right now (quite good food, and good beer), and it's really
  bugging me that I don't know what the typeface is.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nT"
