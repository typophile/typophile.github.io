body: "Just joined this site, and was hoping someone might be able to help me identify
  the typeface used in this logo.  The design was created in 1953 for the Mutual Security
  Agency, then part of the US State Department.  The logo was then adopted by MSA's
  successor organization: the US Agency for International Development.\r\n\r\nI'm
  also very interested in identifying what \"school of art\" the overall design could
  be tied to.  I'm not an art historian, but I'd love to get one to weigh in.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much!\r\n\r\n  - John\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken from this website: [[http://www.usaid.gov/branding/USAID_Graphic_Standards_Manual.pdf|USAID

    case, you should use the Edit link to move the thread up to the main Type ID Board."

    body: I'm pretty sure this image is representative of the original logo.  Here
      is a photo of an original logo on a sticker that appears to have been approved
      on December 1st, 1956.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1430_3756.JPG]

  body: "As you can see, at least M is pretty different to your first sample.\r\nI\u2019m
    not an expert, but hopefully someone else will chime in with suggestions about
    sans in wide use in the fifties in USA."

    body: Very good catch on that M!  Thank you, and hopefully someone will be able
      to nail down the identity of this typeface.

  body: "The generally poor condition of the sample, especially the crease through
    the leg of the R, makes things tough, but this is probably closer overall...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/bold/glyphs.html"

    body: I think you're onto something with Futura for the old sticker.  Do you have
      a guess on the typeface used in the hi-res image from the AID website?
