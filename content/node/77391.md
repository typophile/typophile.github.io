  the 1978 Ford Mustang II King Cobra.\r\n\r\nIt has all upper and lower case, numbers
  and .:;,()? punctuation. I call it the world's most eyestrain inducing display font.

  body: I posted some of my free fonts at [[http://www.1001fonts.com|1001 Fonts]].
    Some of those made their way to dafont without my foreknowledge, but eventually
    I got proper attribution on there too.
