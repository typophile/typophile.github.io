  no thread, so if this a duplicate, sorry.\r\n\r\nGot the email yesterday as an owner
  of Neutraface that House has released [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=612&subpage=viewfontspecimens|Neutraface
  No. 2]], a companion. A quick first impression is that the caps are more Futura
  inspired and less Art Deco looking.\r\n\r\nA nice caps Inline titling weight has
  been added too.\r\n\r\nWith the geometric and alternate humanistic lowercase letters,
  looks like House Industries is going for world domination.\r\n\r\nI like the special
  discount for current owners of Neutraface to upgrade to No.2.\r\n\r\nSo, did Christian
  work on this or did the House team just expand on his work?"

    sick of seeing it used by bad designers in places where the character of the font
    sticks out like a sore thumb. This version will be much more successful at becoming
    ubiquitous. "

  body: "Christian Schwartz updated his orangeitalic site to reflect on the changes
    in Neutraface 2.0. I especially like the improved kerning in the text. The only
    beef one could have with the new design is that the lowercase alternates don't
    get the same attention as they did in the 1.0 version. Notice there are no two-story
    lower case g's with diacritics. Not that I care... I will only set in the english
    language  probably for the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: 'To correct a factual error here: Neutraface No.2 does indeed have full accents
    for all the alternate lowercase letters. Though an example is not up at either
    Christian''s or House''s site, they are in the fonts.'

    I have corrected it. This is what happens when I recycle an old InDesign file
    and don't proofread properly."

  body: "Hi Christian:\r\n\r\nThank you for the correction. I'm so glad that I'm not
    correct about the character set.\r\n\r\nI see Neutraface as a well honed and stylish
    take on the geometric sans, a field occupied by Relay, Verlag, FB Nobel, DTL Nobel,
    Erbar, Drescher Grotesk, FF Super Grotesk, and Futura. These are either stylish
    or austere. But with Neutraface 2.0 I get the bauhaus geometry for serious text
    work and the those stylish details that make it work it for display applications.
    I get it all.\r\n\r\nOn Typographica there was a comparison to Gotham (which I
    personally don't get) but the closest sans would be the exclusive VF Sans from
    Terminal Design for Vanity Fair. All of the things that bugged me about Neutaface
    (and stopped me from buying it) are gone! Your \"neutral\" Neutraface has more
    versatility and I appreciate that :-) \r\n\r\nJust as a side question: In House
    & Garden magazine they started using a slanted version of Neutraface Drafting-
    is that something they came up with or is there Drafting Oblique made special
    for them?\r\n\r\nBest Wishes and keep cranking them out!\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n\r\nPS...
    I love the lower case a and g."

    for them. That magazines is the only place I've seen the Drafting used at all."
