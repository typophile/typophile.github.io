  body: "Font prices, like everything else, are determined by market forces.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Adobe began selling digital fonts in the late eighties, a two-font package (the
    smallest package they offered) was $145. This is $72.50 per font, or about $113
    per font in 2005 dollars. Since then, font prices have dropped considerably. Today,
    most single fonts are sold for $20-$40 each. Purchased in multi-font packages,
    the price per font is even lower.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, although it does take a
    lot of work to create a font, that's not what determines the price. A movie costs
    millions of dollars to make, but you only pay $8 to see it. The reason is that
    millions of other people will pay to see it, too. The font market is much smaller
    in comparison, probably in the tens of thousands of potential customers. Everyone
    else just uses fonts they get for free or bundled with software or whatever happens
    to be installed on their computers. Everyone who has a computer uses fonts, but
    only a small percentage actually buy fonts. These are mainly professionals, who
    understand the value a unique font can add to their work and consider the cost
    of a font just part of doing business, like using FedEx or buying equipment. For
    these people, font prices are not high at all.\r\n\r\nFinally, the reason you
    see fonts everywhere is because, by nature, they are designed to be reproduced.
    There is no limit to how often a single font installed on a single computer may
    be seen on books, magazines, tv, movies, packages, websites, video games, etc.
    It just depends on the kind of work being produced on that computer. You just
    never know."

  body: "> <em>He doesn\u2019t see why, when fonts are everywhere, why one should
    have to pay $15+ for one.</em>\r\n\r\nThis is an unfortunate mind-set that is
    pervasive throughout this new age of digital distribution. It affects all forms
    of intellectual property that has been made readily accessible on the Internet;
    music, literature, motion pictures, photography, illustrations, typefaces, and
    the list goes on. \r\n\r\nI will make no attempt at giving an explanation to give
    to your boss or clients. But to put it simply AND mildly -- <em>readily accessible
    DOES NOT EQUAL available for free</em>!\r\n\r\nThe price of a font and the value
    of a typeface are two different things. What unfortunately has happened within
    the type industry itself, is that well-known reputable font development companies
    joined up with hardware/software development companies twenty years ago and began
    <em>bundling</em> libraries of type with PCs, Macs, printers, software packages,
    etc., resulting in the proliferation of the \"fonts for free\" notion and devaluation
    of font software.\r\n\r\nThis all happened BEFORE type development programs became
    available to run on simple PC/Mac platforms... so the excuse that cheap fonts
    and free and pirated fonts were the original cause of the problem -- it wasn't
    so.\r\n\r\nThe \"bigger\" foundries initiated the proliferation of \"free fonts\"
    and the smaller type developers of the past ten years are almost crippled by it.
    The current habit of novice and hobbiest type designers releasing their designs
    at little to no cost keeps exacerbating the problem.\r\n\r\nI have no solution
    to what is already out there, but just because one particular typeface may cost
    $15 doesn't determine the value of ALL typefaces. Just like a pair of classic
    men's Gucci loafers will cost anywhere from 20 to 50 times more than loafers from
    Payless.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Added Value is the name of the game.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is perceived value:
    when everyone else is using the same fonts and your work stands out with special
    typography, that's worth something extra in the marketplace. To you, to your employer,
    to the client. \r\n\r\nHaving a library of non-standard fonts, and knowing how
    to use them, is a value that a designer/design firm brings to any client relationship.
    Note that Mr Cheese advertises his font library on his web site; it is a benefit
    of doing business with him. \r\n\r\nFonts that come bundled with applications
    or operating systems don't add value, because they are over-exposed.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    working with fonts acquired for a specific design project helps create design
    synergy, which is more productive than wringing your brain for the big idea that
    will add  life to otherwise hackneyed-looking typography. Fonts have formal qualities
    which can be leveraged to drive design concepts.\r\n\r\n\"Free\" fonts don't add
    value because they lack typographic sophistication: it's difficult to do good
    work with poor tools."

    lacks is perspective. When he (or she) travels on business, does he/she fly coach,
    or does he/she fly first class, or even business class? Is there a difference
    in price? Why do first class and business class cost as much as they do?\r\n\r\nIf
    the average businessperson were capable of writing clear, concise and forceful
    prose without resorting to the standard formula of <strong>bullsh*t-bullsh*t-buzzword-bullsh*t--buzzword</strong>,
    then the choice of the typeface used in a proposal or presentation wouldn't be
    such a big deal: the force of the ideas presented, not the bling used to present
    them, would carry the day. Unfortunately, the VAST majority of business proposals
    and presentations which I have seen follow the standard formula to the letter:
    all style and no substance. As a result, the average businessperson  needs all
    the window dressing that he or she can get (regardless of price) to disguise his/her
    lack of originality, insight and content. I hope that this answer meets or exceeds
    your expectations."

    hard to concisely say why they cost what they do. Your boss should understand
    the relationship between pricing and availability/functionality. Many fonts are
    free, or come with OS, Applications, or other acts of bundling, and through their
    wide availability, they are not likely to produce distinctive enough communications
    for some users. So, less widely distributed fonts may cost $1,000 or more when
    installed on a network in order serve the particular taste and function of a readership,
    and none other, and thus be disctinct from the free font crowd.\r\n\r\nIf he don't
    yet get it, tell him he can get free clothes at any number of locations in every
    city in America. So, ask him why he buys clothes.\r\n\r\n"

    Thanks for spending the time to write the piece. I know how long writing can take
    and it's a pretty neat thing that you can do it at least partly in professional
    capacity.\r\n\r\nNorbert: <em>\"...but tired old reasons to buy type isn\u2019t
    going to improve marketability any more than Wonder Bread\u2019s slogan Builds
    bodies twelve ways does for white bread these days.\"</em> Wonder Bread is really
    good with peanut butter banana and bacon grilled like a cheese sandwich. But that
    notwithstanding, tired old reasons to buy type isn't going to improve marketability
    is a useful standpoint.\r\n\r\nFrom a business case point-of-view type is cheaper
    than logos and effective logos are usually part of an ID system and using unique/appropriate
    type in a consistent fashion is way cheaper than an ID system. So really compared
    to other marketing tools, type is relatively cheap.\r\n\r\nType is ubiquitous.
    So keeping the business case point of view, one can argue that type is insanely
    economical because you can, and do, use it with relative impunity and people see
    way more of it than almost all of your other communications and they see it more
    often. So seen in this light, type is probably one of the most economical marketing
    expenses ever.\r\n\r\nHere's a new one: good type is a great design device, and
    so if you are doing print communications of any kind, type is more economical
    and flexible than photography and custom artwork. Present it as a design challenge
    to the designer in a creative brief. No photos. Just type. Type also reproduces
    very well in a single colour. Lower copying costs in short run office printing
    and lower costs in large run press publications.\r\n\r\nYou can also do object
    lessons: Take a business letter and remove all the spaces and cpas and punctuation
    and set it in Courier. Then add spaces, then punctuation, then other adjustments
    until you have a formatted document. The change the courier to something else
    like Dolly and something like Frutiger and add some nice leading and spacing.
    Put them all in a row and say \"That's what type can do.\"\r\n\r\nIs this the
    kind of thing you're talking about?\r\n\r\nJon"
