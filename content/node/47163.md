  not too fat, too thin, too wide, too narrow, unbalanced in any way. \r\n\r\nNot
  too showy, not too bland. \r\n\r\nIt just sits there being perfectly readable, gracious,
  calmly doing its job. \r\n\r\nAmazing. "

  body: "Well Kris Sowersby,\r\n\r\nWithout starting another price flame thread, given
    your occupation (your work is very nice btw), it would be mightly foolish to respond
    to your loaded question with a figure. Any figure stated will likely not be sufficient
    - justifiably so from your view of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the <em>real consumer
    world</em> though, $1,000 for a single license, where we are not given an <em>option</em>
    to select <em>some</em> styles is a little ridiculous.\r\n\r\nGiven the <strong>make
    once, sell many</strong>, nature of type, would it not be more sensible to have
    a mid-range pricing point?\r\n\r\nRocky is brilliant. 30 mins ago, FB would have
    had another sale if it weren't for the price. I and many others have some good
    money for type designers to collect - please make it a little more accessible
    - or provide some <em>options</em>. \r\n\r\n\r\nRocky is brilliant and I don't
    wish to divert the direction of the OP's comments."

  body: ">Rocky vs. Greta vs. Sunday Times Modern\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, Rocky
    is a headline face, as is Sunday Times Modern. The Sunday Times now uses Greta
    Text for text, but you can't really compare it to the other two because of the
    different function. \r\n\r\nThere is a [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/|Greta
    Display and Greta Grande]], but as I said over at [[http://typographica.org/001139.php|Typographica]],
    I find them too sparkly, whereas Greta text is a real winner, one of the \"best
    of 2007.\" For headlines I would prefer both Rocky and Sunday Times Modern to
    the display versions of Greta. \r\n\r\nFor headline, from what I see online--not
    the best test--I definitely prefer Rocky. It has the combination of weight, balance
    and bite that seems to me just right for headlines. I don't know about the issue
    of weights that one reviewer of the new Sunday Times brought up, but I'm pretty
    confident that all of the weights and widths of Rocky would work well, given that
    Carter drew it.  \r\n\r\nIncidentally, I prefer Rocky to \"Postoni\" the Headline
    Bodoni that Carter drew for the Washington Post. It is also very good, though,
    and I know it well as I look at it every morning. I'd rather see Rocky though.
