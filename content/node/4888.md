  I could sift through them at the Adobe site, but was hoping someone had already
  compiled a list. <BR> <BR>Any pointers? <BR> <BR>Many thanks in advance, <BR>Nicky

    support in a huge set such as this. <BR> <BR>Can anyone recommend a collection
    with more cyrillic opentype faces?

  body: Paratype is certainly the leading type foundry for Cyrillic typefaces in general.
    I&#39;m not sure how much they have in OpenType format so far. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Oh, and though Adobe doesn&#39;t have a ton of Cyrillic-supporting typefaces,
    many of our newer and upcoming releases do support Cyrillic. It&#39;s become relatively
    common for us to do typefaces that support extended Latin, Greek and Cyrillic
    all in one go. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    ones or are you going to add cyrillic characters to existing ones as well?

  body: New ones. Three of our next four type families have Cyrillic support &#40;as
    well as Greek and extended Latin&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think we have any
    current plans to retrofit Cyrillic characters to any existing typefaces, however.

  body: Thomas, does the presence of Cyrillic characters affect where InDesign places
    the font in its font menu? I recently switched to the OpenType version of Times
    Ten &#40;which has Cyrillic characters&#41;, and find that it sits in its own
    section near the bottom of the font menu, sandwiched between the Asian type that
    Adobe and Apple thoughtfully supply &#40;but that I never use&#41;.

  body: Yes. <BR> <BR>InDesign &#40;and the Mac OS&#41; try to identify the codepage
    of the font to decide which language section of the font menu it belongs with.
    <BR> <BR>This approach has limitations, of course, when you have fonts that support
    multiple codepages. <BR> <BR>Does this approach seem reasonable to you? What would
    you suggest? <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks for the clarification, Thomas.  <BR> <BR>My preference would be a straightforward
    alphabetical listing. But I don&#39;t do any work with non-Western languages,
    so I can&#39;t comment on the advantages of having the type segregated by language
    support.

  body: Yes, Thomas, unfortuneately, as i know, Paratype don&#39;t make OpenType fonts.
    I just don&#39;t saw that talk was about OpenType exactly. But, however, thank
    you for encouraging promise about cyrillic support in upcoming Adobe fonts. It&#39;s
    good.

    <BR> <BR>Give the user a choice. <BR> <BR>Resurrect ATM Deluxe as Adobe Type Manager
    CS and let it give the user fine-grained control over the CS font menu appearance
    and behavior, even if it can&#39;t exercise such control inside non-Adobe apps
    for lack of access. Now that more and more designers can do all of their work
    in this or that CS app, font management in other apps matters less and less.

    that&#39;s an idea. Thomas, please run with this. I know Noha &#40;Edell&#41;
    at Adobe has been pushing for ATM to come back, and this sounds like a great reason
    for doing so.

  body: "First, Thomas and speter, both those links result in an infinite redirect
    between www.adobe.com... and store.adobe.com... But, this one does the trick:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/C/C_cyrillic.html\r\n\r\nSecond,
    may I applaud Adobe's efforts to design fonts with the whole character-set enchilada:
    Latin, Cyrillic and Greek. (Though, would a Greek enchilada feature feta? I digress.)
    I, for one, set a lot of type that features other languages and certainly prefer
    to use the same font for all the different editions. However, there are precious
    few quality fonts that feature the character-set trifecta and even fewer that
    also include support for East Asian diacritics (specifically, for me, Vietnamese).\r\n\r\nSo,
    thanks, Thomas, for Myriad Pro, Minion Pro, Warnock Pro, Garamond Premier Pro,
    etc. I look forward to seeing the three new fonts soon. I can only hope that other
    foundries follow your example in this global age of communication to offer their
    fonts to users of non-Western alphabets."
