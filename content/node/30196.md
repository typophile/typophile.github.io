  body: "For the salary guide I would suggest that you make the top and bottom white
    areas equal for each level of hierarchy and the same for the tables and similarly
    for some of the left and right margins; align the page numbers on the contents
    page, there is no point making it more difficult for the reader; the AIGA logo
    seems to be bleeding off the edge of the white box; the tables might be easier
    to follow if the three major divisions were slightly more divided (I mean that
    the spaces between the Salary/Wages columns and the Total Compensation columns
    were wider than the space between 25th% and Median, for example), btw the heading
    for the client base table needs an uppercase W. I am not familiar with the 25th%
    and 75th%, what does it mean? You could also look at ranging the figures and column
    heads to a righthand tab, this is especially important for the size of organisation
    table where you have 6-digit numbers above 5-digit. The spaces between tables
    should also be equal. The graph on page 3 might need some kind of legend for the
    upright axis. Finally, the general design is attractive, it is a shame that the
    gummi bears shot is out of focus.\r\n\r\nThe magazine layouts: on the title page
    the running foot is partially invisible against the dark background; on the facing
    page the 1 might be better if it were overhanging the column, I might also work
    on it to make it clear it is a numeral, I read it as I; I wonder if the pullout
    on the second spread is redundant (or at least in the wrong place), the article
    might read better if the paragraph starting \u201CMost Christians imagine\u2026\"
    were taken over to the second spread, while the paragraphs above were taken down
    to make a clear differentiation between the introductory passage and the body
    copy; the pullout could work between points 2 and 3; especially on the second
    spread there is opportunity to clean up the rag, just a few turnovers will improve
    it; I am not clear about the image is it the author?\r\n\r\nHope I've not given
    you too much to think about over the holidays.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I agree with Eric. Think about your audience.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the first
    PDF's design layout, break the grid a bit. It seems a bit unbalanced with the
    photo flush on the verso page and the large space on the recto page on the right
    side. Your \"old style\" call-out for the first letter doesn't work at all. You
    start with \"O\"ne ... but then you start to numbers \"1\" If... It doesn't flow
    at all and the whole notion of calling out the first letter in a paragraph is
    so old school and boring. I would try something more fresh and innovative. Your
    text is also not agreeing with the layout. Its layout is too clean for this type
    of content. Expressive layouts might work better. I'd recommend \"Making and breaking
    the grid\" by Timothy Samara.\r\n\r\nThe second PDF layout is alright. I think
    the photos are too dominate and might need to be scaled back a bit somehow. On
    the front page, you might want to try aligning the AIGA logo box to one of the
    \"boxes\" of candy or something like that. It might make it more interesting and
    feel like it's thought out.\r\n\r\nBest of luck next semester with these projects.
    I'd be interested to see how much these change."
