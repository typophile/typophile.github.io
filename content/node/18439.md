body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a hairline typeface, around the weight of helvetica
  ultra-light, but perhaps a little less instantly recognisable (helvetica light just
  says Marks and Spencers to me!) I've had a look at meta hairline and interstate
  hairline- if anyone can point me in the direction of any others i'd be really greatful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nClare"
