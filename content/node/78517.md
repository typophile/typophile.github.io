  body: "Not sure how you decided that Blackthorn is the original, since Scriptorium
    has very few original fonts. I think I have seen this as Castaway, but I don't
    recall where I saw it. I think Stowaway is earlier than Blackthorn, for what that's
    worth.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I found \"Castaway\" on p.50 of the Solotype Catalog. Sometimes Solo also
    re-named fonts, but my guess is that it's the original that Stowaway and Blackthorn
    were inspired by.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"

  body: "My book references for 19th century typefaces are pretty limited, so I'm
    sure you have more on this period than I do. I know this is beyond the post, but
    the history of these typefaces has always interested me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nThe men referenced produced lettering chapbooks during the early
    twentieth century. I have several of their works in my collection but, at the
    moment, these books are in storage while I am in the process of re-arranging my
    office, so I can't easily get to them. Letterhead Fonts has mined a lot of Atkinson's
    stuff but not, apparently, this particular face."
