body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI noticed that some smallcaps fonts have punctuation marks like
  \"!\" or \"?\" with the same size as the \"regular\" punctuation marks.\r\nOnce
  again, is any \"standard\" procedure to do small caps punctuation marks? Dont do,
  do different or the same size?\r\nThanks for the help.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    caps: just assign the glyphs to 'smcp' feature."

  body: "I would not assign smallcap punctuation to the \u2018smcp\u2019 feature,
    but rather to the \u2018c2sc\u2019 feature. Think about it this way: if applied
    to a whole sentence, \u2018smcp\u2019 changes the lowercase letters to smallcaps
    but preserves the sentence case; \u2018c2sc\u2019 and \u2018smcp\u2019 together,
    as in the InDesign \u2018All Smallcaps\u2019 function, converts the entire sentence
    to smallcaps including punctuation."

    the same token, default figures (whether lining or oldstyle) should be used in
    the small caps feature, and your preferred figure style for \"all small caps\"
    should be put in the \"c2sc\" feature. I would recommend a small-cap height, tab-width
    lining figure style for that.\r\n"
