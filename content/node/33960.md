    body: thanks, Eidetic Modern and Neo look fine (as I can judge them on www.psyops.com)
      but I have to wait for the condensed versions.

    body: ah, thanks, didn't know this function. Works much better than the similar

  body: It's certainly becoming ubiquitous here -- not to the point of being tiresome
    (yet) but definitely noticeable.
