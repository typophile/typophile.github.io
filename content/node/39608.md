  Yun on <a href=\"http://typeandgouda.wordpress.com/\">S\xE9bastien Sanfilippo's
  blog</a>. There are lots of impressive projects by students of the Type]Media Department
  at KABK on display over on the blog. Honmun especially intrigued me because of its
  concept.\r\n\r\nThe text on the poster says: \"Honmun is a Latin typeface for Chinese,
  Japanese and Korean (CJK). It functions as an independent Roman font with CJK specific
  typographic features.\"\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know more about the project or know where
  to find some more information? One of my central interests in typography is multilingual
  typesetting involving Korean and Latin typefaces, so I'd love to learn more about
  this. I know Seonil Yun has posted on Typophile in the past; if I asked politely,
  could she be coaxed into coming out here again to enlighten us?"

  body: "Hello Jongseong, Dan,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest in my graduation
    project at the KABK. Friends of mine notified me of this post... (thanks! ^^)
    I have been swamped with some other work and was away from it all missing chances
    to share more about it. I will put it on my website (under construction -_-;)
    or some other places sooner or later, but in the meantime, I will do my best to
    answer your questions. I would appreciate your patience in case my reply gets
    delayed.\r\n\r\nHonmun is more specifically a Latin typeface for several existing
    CJK Myungjo (or Mincho in Japanese, Ming or Song in Chinese) style type that can
    work with different multilingual layout options and typesetting features. There
    are multitudes of ways to avoid the visual collision between more than two blocks
    of script cultures, but the most tricky case can be found in mixing them in a
    single body of text set with classic printing type. Unlike hybrid CJK type--meaning
    that its design concept is more or less derived directly from existing Western
    typefaces--or sans serif typefaces, Myungjo style holds strong calligraphic influences
    which filibuster creating a pigeon pairing pair. Also, highly localized typesetting
    applications and environment--difficulties in procuring quality CJK typefaces
    or CJK compatible typesetting apps as well as type technological format or standard
    issues, etc.--make it hard to explore cross-cultural typographic conventions of
    CJK with a Latin type. \r\n\r\nThere were some self-imposed constraints to assimilate
    the ordinary working environment of multilingual typesetting especially in the
    West. There are still lots of technical problems and questions that have to be
    dealt with. I am still learning discovering more interesting stuff that I did
    not even know at the time of starting the project, which is good.  There is a
    saying in Korea: the ignorant is the bravest, and that was me. ^^\r\n\r\nI would
    like to thank all the direct or indirect expertise, encouragement and help for
    this project taking advantage of this occasion. I will be glad to hear your ideas
    and suggestions any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    sounds interesting and ambitious, and there must be any number of ways to go with
    this concept; I'm curious to see what your take was on it. It must have been a
    challenging project, and I'm glad you were brave enough to take it on. Projects
    like this are much appreciated. I definitely will be looking forward to seeing
    more of Honmun."
