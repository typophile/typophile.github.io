  think it would be enormously helpful to have an open thread where experienced typographers
  and graphic designers list their best printers. Personally, I need more environmentally
  friendly printing resources, but even more, I want to support small artisan printers,
  true craftsmen, that do great work (William Morris would be proud, huh?) I don't
  have a big, slick printer I *love* in my virtual roledex, either.\r\n\r\nI, for
  one, would like to give a shout out to <a href=\"http://www.blackpearlpress.com/letterpress_studio.html>
  Black Pearl Press.</a>\r\n\r\nAnyone else have a printer they count on to do extraordinary
  work? Links would be great ... locations can be anywhere. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEileen\r\n<a

    Publishing</a> in Portland, OR is awesome. They work with soy inks and have lots
    of recycled paper options. Their work is really, really good and their prices
    even better."

  body: "Realistically, green advertising/promotion is just hype. And converting to
    green is all about money. Corporations that have been raping the plantet for years
    are paying services to make them appear as if they are green. Seen a car commercial
    on TV lately? \r\n\r\nPrinting is not green; it is one of the most wasteful industrial
    processes there is. Soy!!! They are cutting down the Amazon Rain Forest (the lungs
    of the planet) to grow soy. Soy inks are \"aggressive\" to ink rollers, resulting
    in their early replacement. Come on folks. Care about the Earth, not about what
    it is hip to care about. Do some research before jumping on the band wagon.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "I've done a great deal of research on the topic. While Gerald makes a valid
    point about many, many corporations, I know there are truly green options available
    for printing. \r\n\r\nUV Curable Inks are the most environmental option, soy clearly
    isn't a sustainable choice. Water based UV curable inks produce no VOC's (which
    about 99% of all other inks produce) which have been proven to accelerate climate
    change AND bring harm to human health.\r\n\r\nUV Curable inks are widely available
    in Europe, but harder to find in the US. (BTW, the link that Alaskan posted above
    is a printer that offers them.)\r\n\r\nThe best paper option is TCF (Totally Chlorine
    Free) but it's real hard to find in the US.  Dioxin is a by-product of chlorine
    bleaching, and it's an evil toxin that kills  flora, fauna and humans.  (It's
    the chemical that almost killed President Viktor Yushchenko during an assassination
    attempt.)  Chlorine bleaching also uses copious amounts of water.\r\n\r\nAs far
    as other substrates, stay away from PVC. When PVC is discarded, burning it produces
    nasty chemicals into the environment. \r\n\r\nEileen"

  body: "max\r\n\r\nInteresting question. Paper has been fairly okay for quite some
    long time, ever since the paper mills discovered that acid-free papers were cheaper
    to produce in the long run. Acid ate the pipes. The ink manufacturers comply with
    federal guidelines and respond to consumer demand (not always so good, re: soy).
    Solvent manufacturers are really on top of it and have discontinued useful products
    and substituted green crap that actually destroys rollers and presses. So, basically,
    you get what you want and are willing to pay for, for better or worse. \r\n\r\nWhat
    about the printer? Hey, folks who claim they are green just to get your green,
    come on. What ever happened to folks who would guarantee you quality printing?\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "I am not prepared or willing to recommend any printer because of how \"green\"
    they are. I share Gerald's skepticism about the current bandwagon everyone seems
    mad to jump on; I'm sure you've heard the term \"greenwashing\".... I'm past the
    idealistic stage (my 20's) where everything had to be ideologically pure. Give
    me real green solutions, like riding a bicycle, or not printing anything in the
    first place....  ;)\r\n\r\nHowever I have a local printer who has a fantastic
    range of processes he offers. From Intaglio etching to letterpress (large old
    cast-iron standing press), to offset, puff ink, screen print, vinyl plotting,
    he's very interested and capable. Very pleasant to work with and his dogs are
    adorable to boot. But Eileen, you give absolutely no clue where you are, so I'm
    not sure if this printer is for you.... Why do you ask? In any case, it's John
    Sullivan at Logos Graphics in San Francisco. To locals, I recommend him heartily;
    he likes working with artists and designers. "

  body: Eileen, thanks for the informative post.  While I'm sure Gerald is right about
    the impure motives of many businesses, I still see wisdom in researching the most
    ecologically friendly approaches to printing and supporting them.

  body: "I share Gerald's cynicism of many corporations who wear the cloak of environmentalism.
    Especially companies like Wal-Mart who are marketing \"reduced packaging\" like
    mad. Truth is this -- very soon they'll be responsible for paying the associated
    collecting, sorting, transportation and recycling costs for all the useless product
    packaging they dump into the world. It's already required of manufacturing companies
    in many other countries, so they're being forced to change by the EU and Japan.\r\n\r\n<strong>BUT...</strong>\r\n\r\nAs
    a member of the human race (earth's worst abuser) I feel obligated not to give
    up the search for better options. Solvents aren't needed to make gorgeous, unforgettable
    prints, and bleached paper isn't \"okay\" at all.  Light-Works offers solvent
    free inks, Bioflex and other green substrates, AND won 1st place digital print
    award from SGIA last year.  Quality and environmentalism <em>can </em>go together.
    \ Many printers <em>do actually care</em> about the environment and invest accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn
    short, just because many green efforts are full of crap, we shouldn't stop looking
    for printers that do the hard work of offering genuine alternatives. I do my part
    by voting with dollars.\r\n"
