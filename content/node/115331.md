  body: "I have been asked to make a copy of this clasp. Before I draw up all the
    text, I wondered if there was a regular font close to it. It's a little like a
    clarendon but with squarish serifs and a different leg on the R.\r\nanybody know?\r\nThanks
    very much,\r\nMatt."

    closer to the general style of your sample.

  body: "Not a lot of detail so lots of room for error.\r\nBut I believe I see a the
    remnants of square serifs rather than the cove used in Clarendon. This means that
    the designer would have based the design on a font style then called Antique --
    which we now call Egyptian. To recreate I could perhaps go with a modified Lino
    Letter Bold compressed to 80% with an adjustment to make the leg on R more vertical.
    Hope this is of some help.\r\nDon\r\n"
