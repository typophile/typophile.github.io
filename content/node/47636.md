  to find a good font for dates, info, etc. Let me know what you think. Thanks\r\n\r\nP.S.
  Please no suggestions about the logo, I didn't design it, the event has used it
  for years, and i unfortunately don't have the option to change it. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zooscon-1_5896.jpg]"

  body: I'm open to suggestions about placement, but i was thinking just below the
    header  slightly right of center and certainly over the artwork, its not much
    copy, the dates will be most prominent -Thanks keep the input comin!
