  an English book. In the English book, 3 typefaces are used:\r\n\r\nUnivers (Title,
  Body copy)\r\nSabon (Subtitles)\r\nCourier (Callouts)\r\n\r\nI need to find Japanese
  equivalents or substitutions for these typefaces.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have suggestions
  on good Japanese typefaces or ways to go about finding the optimal Japanese substitutions?\r\n\r\nThanks!

    fonts with Japanese support equivalents to Latin designs because of the writing
    style differences. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, I would suggest a gothic style for
    Univers and a Mincho style for a serif or Sabon.\r\n\r\nYou can get an idea of
    the styles available here:\r\nhttp://www.ascenderfonts.com/category/japanese-fonts.aspx"

  body: "Finding the Japanese equivalent of Courier is the interesting bit. Courier
    is used for many reasons. Sometimes, it is used to evoke the output of typewriters.
    Sometimes, it is used mainly because it is a monospaced font, especially to display
    code.\r\n\r\nNow, because most Japanese typefaces are monospaced anyway when it
    comes to the kana and the kanji, it's tricky to decide what to use for the translation
    when in the original Courier was used only because it is a monospaced font.\r\n\r\nI
    might be wrong, but I have the feeling that in Japan the Courier rough equivalent
    is probably the monolinear, rounded \u30CA\u30FC\u30EB(Nar). It's visually distinct
    from the Mincho or Gothic styles, and is quite widely used. I'm having trouble
    finding any information on it in English, though. Here's the Japanese Wikipedia
    page: [[http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u30CA\u30FC\u30EB]]"

  body: I would browse the fonts at the Morisawa or Iwata websites. Your body font
    (the Univers equivalent) will probably be a basic Gothic of some kind. For the
    other two, you'll want to choose whatever fits the character of the book. Don't
    constrain yourself too closely to matching Sabon or (ugh) Courier.

  body: "It's hard to say the equivalents without seeing the design you try to make,
    but,\r\n\r\nIf you need to set Japanese font and Univers together in the same
    page, I recommend you use AXIS Font from [[http://www.typeproject.com/|Type Project]].
    AXIS Font covers wide range weights and has smart skeleton, each weight style
    of which was developed along with the one of Linotype Univers. Axis trial fonts
    are available to use from [[http://www.typeproject.com/trial/|here]]. The trial
    version font has only Regular weight and the limitation that Kanji have about
    1000 characters only, but all Hiragana and Katakana characters are included, so
    you can check the looking of it before buying it. Of course, the retail version
    of AXIS Fonts have all Kanji characters (Adobe-Japan1-3).\r\n\r\nThe retail site
    is [[http://www.axisfont.com/|here]].\r\nThis site is only Japanese language,
    but the customer support via Contact will answer your request in English.\r\n\r\nApple
    Japan uses AXIS fonts on its web site. You can also browse them [[http://www.apple.com/jp/|here]].\r\n\r\nSabon
    goes well with Mincho style. Kozuka Mincho from Adobe might be good for Sabon.
    And Kozuka and AXIS, both Kanas of these have similar skeleton, I think these
    work well together. Kozuka family has Gothic style but it has tiny serifs on the
    end of strokes, so I recommend AXIS for Gothic style. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, almost
    of Japanese foundry don't support the order from overseas. However, Linotype deals
    with [[http://www.linotype.com/289648/typebank-library.html|Typebank family]],
    it would be helpful for you to get Japanese fonts quickly. Typebank Gothic and
    Mincho would be useful to combine with Univers and Sabon.\r\n\r\nWhich Courier,
    rounded or edged? Its hard to find the an equivalent of Courier. I can say rounded
    san-serif might be better, but Gothic would be also no problem for it.\r\n\r\nM+
    1m might be good for it, but it seems to be in progress now, so it doesn't have
    enough Kanji characters to set Japanese texts.\r\n\r\nI hope it would be helpful
    for you.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\nKunihiko Okano Shotype.com"

  body: "thanks everyone for your input. this is incredibly helpful.  \r\n\r\nthe
    main typeface will be the univers equivalent - and from the discussions here,
    it seems Axis, Hiragino, will work. Sabon equivalent is not used often, but i
    realized is set in a multiplicity of styles (regular, bold, italic, bold italic).
    i will need to make some decisions about type based on the mincho selection. the
    courier type is the rounded version. the \u30CA\u30FC\u30EB(Nar) typeface seems
    to fit this purpose. \r\n\r\nthanks again.\r\n\r\n"
