body: In Norway, lining figures are so widely used with lower case display settings
  that people sometimes percieve them as "wrong". Does any one have similar experience?

  body: "Do you mean they perceive oldstyle figures as wrong? I know they still look
    wrong to me (in the U.S.). Even after gaining a better understanding of them and
    their purpose, they still read funny to me. And when designing,if I don't call
    up a model to guide me, I can never figure out which ones are short and which
    ones go up or down.\r\n\r\nNumbers are all lining-height when they're taught in
    elementary school here, both in handwriting and in math lessons, and it becomes
    hard to see them any other way."

  body: Yes. I've been told to "change those funny looking numbers back to regular
    ones" at occasions.

    past writing in original sources and letters, and epigraphy studies past writing
    on walls. Contemporary handwriting is totally ignored.

  body: "The notion that you use lining figures with caps and old-style with lower
    case is just a quick guideline. I've seen many advertisements -- print and web
    -- that were about two lines long, used lowercase letters and old-style numbers,
    and just looked odd. Lining figures would have looked much more natural.\r\n\r\nContrast
    this to a book where the practice is to put citations run into the text instead
    of as footnotes: e.g.\r\n\r\n\"The facticity of the self is what it is not, and
    on the other hand, is not what it is\" (BAN 113) [The quote is from <cite>Being
    and Nothingness</cite> but the page number is invented.]\r\n\r\nNow imagine a
    book where there are about 5 such citations per page -- 10 on a spread. With the
    book open, if the citations are set full caps with lining figures, what jumps
    out and clamors for attention are those citations. Probably not what the author
    would consider the most important thing in his/her text. If they are set small
    caps w/ old-style figures, they assume their proper importance visually.\r\n\r\nSo
    context matters. So too does audience expectations. You can set mathematics with
    os figs -- it was done for years when they were the only set of figures available.
    But os figures look odd to most modern audiences reading math, and should probably
    not be used, even though the text will be use mainly lowercase letters.   \r\n\r\n"
