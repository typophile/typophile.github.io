body: "I use ITC New Baskerville as a titling/display face quite often at work. New
  Baskerville is gorgeous, but the hairlines get too big at larger sizes, so I\u2019m
  working on a Baskerville for large sizes. I am working from a scan of the 48-point
  Stephenson Blake Fry\u2019s Baskerville presented on page 34 of <em>The Western
  Heritage of Type Design</em>, under the assumption that the type was cast with new
  matrices made from the original punches\u2014I\u2019ll check up on that one <em>after</em>
  graduation. Because I\u2019m still figuring the whole font-creation thing out, after
  the glyphs are drawn I am comparing them to Bitstream\u2019s very fabulous Fry\u2019s
  to spot my mistakes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/large_frys_1_6485.png]"

  body: Maybe it's in the original, but the tops of the H I L all look way to heavy
    to me. U and J too.

  body: "You\u2019re right, they are too heavy. I think that I oversimplified the
    curve and lost odd shape of the curve in there, I probably need to add another
    point along the curve so that I can tweak it some more."

    or was it really straight? '

  body: "Most of the verticals are straight\u2014All the Fry\u2019s designs are like
    that\u2014but there are a few subtle curves left that I\u2019m working in. I blew
    some stuff up and checked out the top serifs and they\u2019re a little off, but
    not too much; I think that the issue is that my hairlines are a little too narrow,
    which is making everything else look that much thicker. I also need to bump my
    cap height a little bit, right now it\u2019s still too close to being proportioned
    for text. "

  body: "I\u2019ll probably end up doing a poster version with absolutely insanely
    crisp hairlines after I figure out my proportions, but right now they\u2019re
    looking a little wacky in print. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m also tempted to produce a version
    with rounded terminals, because ink spread often made those tiny serif tips look
    round. It feels SO much warmer that way. "

  body: My guess is that you can have all the lovely hairlines you want but you have
    to manage the weight in the heavy bits very very carefully. Maybe more than they
    did in the original.
