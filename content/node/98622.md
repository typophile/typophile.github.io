  glyph moves out of place when clicked on. e.g. instead of abc it would be acb. And
  i dont know how to get rid of the issue. \r\n\r\nI have attached a screen shot of

    engine and does not rely on any specific OT feature being written into the font?
    Not having attempted a Devanagari design (yet), I had always assumed that there
    would need to be language-specific OT features written to handle vowel positioning,
    etc. Has this burden been shifted to the layout engine? And if so, I assume it
    is responding purely to the Unicode codepoints in the text flow? Cool.

  body: "Kent: <em>So, John, am I to understand that this happens at the level of
    the text processing engine and does not rely on any specific OT feature being
    written into the font?</em>\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\nThe layout engine is responsible
    for any standard reordering, such as the short <em>i</em> in Devanagari, Bengali
    and other northern scripts, and for splitting two-part vowels in southern scripts.
    The font is responsible for what happens with these glyphs after re-ordering.
    What this means is that the font GSUB and GPOS lookups need to presume reordering.
    So, for example, if you want to vary the width of the short <em>i</em> vowel sign
    dependent on the width of the letter or conjunct to which it applies, you make
    variant substutions based on the <em>following</em> (right side) context, even
    though the phonetic character input has the vowel after the letter/consonant.
    Between the character input and the glyph substitution, the Indic layout engine
    is performing reordering.\r\n\r\nThe reordering is based on standard Unicode rules,
    so when the layout engine sees the character code for the short <em>i</em> in
    the text, it knows that the glyph associated with that code in the font cmap table
    needs to be reordered.\r\n\r\n<em>I had always assumed that there would need to
    be language-specific OT features written to handle vowel positioning, etc.</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    is a good idea to make a usage distinction between '(re)ordering' and 'positioning'.
    Positioning would be an instance of GPOS, typically an anchor attachment positioning
    of a combining mark, so would apply to e.g. the <em>u</em> vowel sign. Ordering
    is a buffered character level operation (buffered in this case meaning that the
    underlying Unicode character string is not affected, only the display)."

    \u2014 Let me make sure I\u2019ve got this. If I wanted a longer-reaching <em>i</em>
    for a conjunct syllable like <em>sti</em> (\u0938\u094D\u0924\u093F) for example:
    \r\n\r\nThe input would be something like 0938 (<em>sa</em>) 094D (<em>virama</em>)
    0924 (<em>ta</em>) 093F (<em>i</em>)\r\n\r\nBut I would want my contextual sub
    to be something like <em>sub i' sa.half ta by i.longer</em> (assuming, of course,
    that I\u2019ve already provided a many-to-one substitution to implement the <em>sa</em>
    half form).\r\n\r\nIs that about right?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It is a good idea to

    yes, thanks for that. And thanks for the link. I\u2019ll take a closer look when
    I get a moment. Also, I\u2019ll dig out my copy of <em>LCT</em>. \r\n\r\nAlthough,
    since I don\u2019t have such a project in hand and it\u2019s more of an idle curiosity
    I\u2019ll probably let it go for now. But rest assured, if I ever undertake a
    Devanagari font, I\u2019ll be in touch (offline ;-).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Your character input is correct, i.e. phonetic.\r\n\r\nWith regard to lookup
    input, the ikar variant width substitution is a contextual 'pres' feature substitution,
    which would normally be applied after 'pres' conjunct formation, which would in
    turn be applied after 'half' form substitution. So there would be a sequence of
    three lookups affecting this syllable. In VOLT syntax and using my naming conventions,
    these would be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. d.half\r\n<code>dSa dHalant -> dS.half</code>\r\n\r\n2.
    d.pres.conjuncts\r\n<code>dS.half dTa -> dSTa</code>\r\n\r\n3. d.pres.ikarwide\r\n<code>dSignI
    -> dSignI.wide\r\n| dSTa</code>\r\n\r\nObviously in the last of these the context
    string is more likely to be a class of glyphs of similar width. \r\n\r\nIn the
    Adobe Devanagari fonts, we used a lot of ikar variants to get quite precise relationships
    between the tip of the ikar and the main stem of the following letter, as one
    finds in manuscripts. In some more recent designs, we've limited the number of
    variants, since some readers found the very long ikars in Adobe Devanagari distracting
    on the page."
