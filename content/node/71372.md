    you started on this topic.\r\nTwo tips for next time: it\u2019s always better
    to bump your thread than to start a new one. You can also add new pictures to
    your original thread. And: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2\"
    title=\"Frequently Asked Question \u2013 What do I enter in the \u201CTitle\u201D
    line?\">Please use a descriptive title!</a> Thank you."
