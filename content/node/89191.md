body: Was wondering if anyone knew the name of this font. Have been trying find it
  for a while now. I am looking for the font used in the word "devious". The "one"
  text I do not need. [[http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles7/743881/projects/2571511/3d014d2bb5946f59bc1e1760ee2b0afb.jpg]]

  body: "This looks heavily customised. The \"eviou\" part looks familiar, but even
    that has had things done to it so just running those letters through ID software
    might not get you anywhere. \r\n\r\nHave a look at Joshua Smith AKA [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Hydro74/|Hydro74]]'s
    fonts, and the link to his site. "
