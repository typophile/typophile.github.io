    the character shapes are similar but not the stroke weight. Maybe it was done
    by hand.'

  body: That&#39;s what I was thinking, but I couldn&#39;t find a digital Very Light
    Eurostile. And I&#39;m not oldschool enough to know whether such a thing ever
    existed.. Of course it could always be a custom design based on Eurostile.

  body: 'Actually, it looks more like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=microgramma"
    target="_blank">Microgramma</a> than Eurostile... check out the extended top of
    the F, and the dot on the I would likely extend to that length if everything was
    stretched downward... such slight differences from Eurostile.. the only background
    I could find on Euro/Micro was that it was designed off of Bank Gothic.... anybody
    know any history about these? <BR> <BR>edit: whoops, kind of already been covered...
    just trying to expound a bit though.'

  body: Very easy to recreate, once you have a &#34;super ellipse&#34; done -- eg
    the shape formulated by Danish scientist Piet Hein and used by Danish furniture
    makers to make a table that &#34;is not round nor square&#34; and makes everyone
    seated around equally important &#40;there being no head of the table, I guess&#41;.
    <BR>And what furniture makers can do, type designers can too... <BR>Just my 2
    cts - and a bit off topic, haha.

  body: 'Armchair Modern appears to use the basics of the super ellipse. Nice.  <BR>There
    is something wholesome about this shape. Being the son of a carpenter I value
    the fact that is the maximum of roundness one can obtain with the minimum of waste
    &#40;talking about shaping a table top, you know&#41;.  <BR>I remember once reading
    about a trick one could use to draw this shape properly by using pencil, string
    and a couple of nails -- but can&#39;t remember the particulars of that... <BR>
    <BR>There is a lot of info on this on the Net, eg: <BR><a href="http://www.explainthat.info/su/super-ellipse.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.explainthat.info/su/super-ellipse.html</a> <BR>The
    bit about the negotiation table for the Paris peace talks is especially illuminating.
    Seems that Piet Hein did not INVENT it, but REDISCOVERED ist.'

  body: When looking around, I read somewhere that Herman Zapf based Melior on the
    super ellipse. Very probably so. <BR>&#40;Piet Hein was a direct ascendant of
    the 16th century Dutch naval &#34;hero&#34; Piet Hein. There is a famous young
    Dutch furniture designer, Piet Hein Eek, whose parents must have a nice sense
    of humour&#41;.
