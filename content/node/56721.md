  body: "That seems to be a version of an old film type called \"Zelda\", shown in
    the Dover book \"Moderne Alphabets\" by Dan X. Solo. In the book it is shown as
    two-color lettering, with one part dark and the other light.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Actually, the original name is "Zelek". "Zelda" is probably one of those "similar
    to" fonts.

    matches them exactly. I know Solo sometimes renamed typefaces.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I have a Mecanorma catalog from the early '70s where it is called Zelek Black.
    Bronislaw Zelek is credited as its designer. There were also some related fonts,
    Zelek Shadline, Zelek Bold, and Zelek Boldline. There is also another face he
    did called New Zelek that pops up here now and then. \r\n\r\nSolo probably didn't
    rename it. \"Zelda\" probably came from a pirate source, which was quite common
    if you look through catalogs from back in the film font days, even from major
    typesetting houses."

  body: I guess they're using the term "Letraset" generically, as in "rub down type".
    Letraset never carried Zelek, only Mecanorma as far as I know. The only difference
    I can see is that the lines dividing the shapes in the letters are thicker than
    in the original.

  body: "Hi, I redrew this typeface for Wired UK, I found it in an old Typaedia catalogue
    although it was named 'Zoro', I couldn't find a digital version and I didn't know
    who originally created it. Great to find out it was Bronislaw Zelek, thanks Mark.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nSimon"
