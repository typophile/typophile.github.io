  I solved the problem of Mac and Windows having different line spacing with my font.  While
  fixing the cross-platform issue I took a close look at all the vertical metrics
  and have the following question. <BR> <BR>I have a few characters &#40;capitals
  with two accents and h-circumflex&#41; that are higher than the WinAscent value.  They
  are clipped off on screen in most Windows apps, as would be expected, but they print
  OK on the two printers I have.  Is it safe to assume that all printers will handle
  them OK?  I think users will be happy if they print correctly &#40;and since they
  are rare it&#39;s not likely that they will appear right under a descender, which
  would look bad&#41;. <BR> <BR>Alternatives are to make special low versions of uppercase
  vowels for use under double accents or to change the WinAscent value.  I tried the
  former solution and don&#39;t like how it looks. The latter is not a good idea since
  users who upgrade to a new version of the font may find their page breaks changing
  in existing documents.  Is there any real danger is just leaving things as they
  are? <BR> <BR>Thanks - David

    PCL and PostScript printers may print them OK but Windows GDI printers may exhibit
    the same problems that occur on screen.  <BR> <BR>Adam'

  body: 'David, your best bet is to leave things as they are, since the options for
    changing them are more generallt problematic than the problem itself. There is
    a chance that some printers may reproduce the clipping, but in my experience this
    is very rare. Even MS ship fonts that have some tall glyphs clipped, and they
    maintain the WinAscent value for exactly the same backwards compatibility issues
    that you describe. <BR> <BR>Adam, can you suggest some possible GDI printers that
    might have this problem? I&#39;d like to track one down and run some tests. Also,
    I&#39;m assuming that this work-around would avoid the problem, even on such printers:
    print to PDF, then print PDF.'

  body: One quick way of looking at it is that 95% of all common inkjet printers are
    GDI devices. So if you have clipping on-screen, it&#39;s likely to be a problem
    in print for a significant chunk of customers. Even high-end graphic professionals
    often do rough proofs on non PostScript color inkjets. <BR> <BR>T
