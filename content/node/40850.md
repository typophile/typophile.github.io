body: "Hello Typophiles!\r\n\r\nI never thought a sans serif would be so difficult
  until I tried it for the first time! I worked on this typeface for about six months
  now, just tweaking, scrapping, re-doing, and more tweaking. I have a rough set of
  uppercase characters and numbers, but I want to present the lower case characters
  for now as I feel it's closer to completion than the rest. \r\n\r\nMy intention
  is to make a \"food\" font, where the typeface will look good on food & beverage
  products, restaurant menus, cookbooks, personalized recipes, etc. I used keywords
  such as homestyle, aroma, fresh, delicious, tender, sweet, and organic, and tried
  to incorporate those qualities into the letters. At the same time, legbility is
  very important where text is versatile enough to be read from caption sizes to headers.
  It might be difficult to say that a typeface could be made for a specific use, so
  maybe this shouldn't be a \"food\" font as it is inevitable that the personality
  of the face could be applied to other projects and subjects?\r\n\r\nI created Whisk
  in TypeTool and I haven't worked on the kerning sets yet. If it's something that
  should be pushed further to a family, then I'll upgrade to FontLab.\r\n\r\nMy biggest
  challenge is creating a typeface that is different from all the other sans out there,
  but at the same time, I would like a set that appears to have the same \"genetic
  code,\" to be highly legible, and to conform to my goal of creating a type that
  is applicable for a specific category. Right now, I need fresh eyes and a new perspective,
  so I really appreciate any feedback, and if possible, a critique. Thank you!\r\n\r\nJoachim\r\n\r\n<strong>Updates:</strong>
  Whisk set v3, and 2 samples of it in use."

  body: "This seems like a really great start, and I think that Whisk's overall communication
    is one of friendliness, creativity and approachability, which strikes me as just
    about perfect for use in cookbooks. I think the challenge for you will be to create
    really, really exquisite numeral characters, since in both menus and cookbooks,
    there is nothing more important or prominent.\r\n\r\nCouple thoughts on individual
    characters. I think the left portion of the 'f' crossbar could use some shortening.
    As it is, the crossbar makes overall character width feel too wide, and I think
    it seems to point backwards which will distrupt the overall flow of reading.\r\n\r\nI
    find the curved leg of the 'k' to be slightly problematic, as it seems to create
    a weak base and therefore a timid, off-balance letterform. Perhaps it would benefit
    from a more pronounced, traditional leg, and then bringing the curved stroke to
    the arm so it keeps the same attitude as the rest of the letterforms, similar
    to that of the \"w.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'x' aslo seems to stand out as having almost
    <em>too</em> much character. I think that if the curved strokes were a little
    more subtle, again like that of the \"w,\" you'd be better off.\r\n\r\nJust suggestions,
    I think it's a quirky and beautiful start that will work well for its intended
    use.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Darrin, thank you for the great critique! I tried your suggestion to create
    more consistency with the 'v' and the 'w' and it's appears more unified now. I
    also tweaked a few letters (s, e, c, g, t, f) to be more smoother in the curves.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the numerals will have to be a big focus since numbers are important
    in cookbooks. Thank you for bringing up that point!\r\n\r\nAttached is version
    2 of the lc characters."

    of the playfulness of the 'K,V,W,X'. The overall feel is friendly and shows lots

  body: "Hi Joachim :^) I love the individuality you've engineered into this face.
    It needs refinement but not much. Too much refinement will spoil its effect.\r\n\r\nLower
    case crits:\r\n* bowl of a could be narrowed --- experiment with that and see
    how you like it. The bowl would also benefit from a more distinctive shape. Probably
    a downward droop will look okay, but subtle to avoid breaking out of the overall
    geometric form of this font. I can do a drawing if you want. Just say.\r\n\r\n*
    lower bowl of g could use more width. Ear of g is diminutive and non-descript.
    Make it larger and longer, and bring it up off the x-line to avoid collisions.\r\n\r\n*
    truncated tail of y may alarm some people\r\n \r\n* u appears to be same width
    as n. I usually make u narrower as a basic refinement\r\n\r\n* s is very nice
    but maybe a bit wide\r\n\r\n* k is excellent\r\n\r\n* v and w --- the curved parts
    are nicely drawn, but cause the characters to appear narrower than they really
    are. Solution is to make them a bit wider. Experiment until they look right in
    combination with other letters.\r\n\r\nCapitals crits:\r\n* outer curve on lower
    bowl of B needs some adjustment\r\n\r\n* V and W --- same thing going on there
    as the loweer case siblings.\r\n\r\n* S maybe a little wide for some tastes. Narrow
    it if you want to for more refinement, or leave as is if you like it.\r\n\r\n*
    K is flipping excellent.\r\n\r\n* Y, same deal as lower case y\r\n\r\n* G bar
    level is in no man's land right now. It can be aligned with H bar, or left as
    is\r\n\r\n* Middle bar on E and F in old skool mode, being shorter than the main
    arms. You may want to bring the length out some for a more contemporary look.\r\n\r\n*
    A is sweet. One advantage of the gothic form is freedom in placement of the bar.
    This one can be aligned with the other bars if you want it to.\r\n\r\nOverall
    this is an excellent first effort and I am of course going to push you to develop
    it further and finish it, and most important of all, I'll help you sell it to
    designers.\r\n\r\n<em>My intention is to make a \u201Cfood\u201D font, where the

    an explicitly food-oriented font with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jellybrush/\"
    target=\"_new\">Jellybrush</a>, and succeeded in every respect. It turned out
    to be very useful for food product branding and packaging, and the part I didn't
    plan --- it works very well for soft and rubbery things like pillows and manchester
    items, bathroom products and kitchen stuff as well.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBeth, the
    fact is I'm in love with you. No, I'm kidding, I'm married. Just thought I'd mention
    you look very spunky ;^)\r\n\r\nI know how it feels tho, I've done food branding
    over and over. I beat the gourmet cliches by writing new material about food.
    It was the only way to preserve my sanity.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "Thank you for the comments Joe, Beth, and James!\r\n\r\nJames, I really appreciate
    the fantastic comments, and after running some print tests and incorporating the
    above suggestions, I've just put up the newest PDF file. I am also very grateful
    for your offer in helping me sell Whisk once it's completed, and your experience
    with Jellyfish is very inspirational!\r\n\r\nIn addition to refining almost every
    letter, N, M, Z, and z have changed from the previous version. I also added a
    rough set of numbers (going with old style figures) and some punctuation. Once
    I upgrade to FontLab (from TypeTool), I'll implement OpenType features that allow
    titling figures and small caps.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I think I still need to
    work on g, as it appears too dark in colour, and I'm not entirely convinced with
    y or Y either. The numerals need to be more refined, especially for 3 and 5, and
    maybe it's just me, but 8 feels slightly darker in colour. Thanks again for all
    the comments, and I'm looking forward to hearing about what can be improved in
    this version."

  body: "Version 2 is an improvement all-round except for the curved arms on x and
    X. It's okay to widen them as you have, but now you need to revise the point where
    they connect with the intersection for improved flow-on from the lower left stroke.
    Alternatively, return x and X to version 1 as the width affectation of those curved
    arms is not really a problem for them the way it was for v and w.\r\n\r\nNew M
    and N go well with the rest of the font and help evoke the food-like organic theme,
    more so than the roman forms of version 1.\r\n\r\nCurved spines of z and Z look
    good. This structure is often drawn poorly and unpopular with font buyers for
    that reason, but you've done it subtly and I think they will survive on merit.\r\n\r\ng
    --- ear is improved but it could use more length. Keep working on the body to
    get the weight right. I think it's more a matter of uneven stroke density than
    the whole thing being too heavy. Experiment with making the lower bowl taller
    for a more balanced letter design.\r\n\r\na --- improved, but could be refined
    further. I've taken the liberty of doing a drawing as it's the best way of demonstrating
    what to do. The changes are aimed at refinement but also to add rigor to the bowl.
    Note this is a rough drawing done with pixels and only intended to show the direction
    to go in.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whisk_a_anim_6404.gif]\r\n\r\nNumerals
    --- yes 3 and 5 need work. I'm sure you'll figure them out. Try tapering the diagonal
    strokes of 4 and 7. Spine of 2 looks a bit heavy and the structure shows the corruption
    of the Arabic/Indian form seen in many well-established fonts. The lower left
    corner bulges up and left. For examples of uncorrupted 2 form, study Bitstream
    Vera Sans, Gill sans, Futura, Frutiger. \r\n\r\nWhisk is shaping up nicely! Keep
    a' going. \r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "James, thanks for the comments and suggestions! Hopefully the revision that
    I put up today is a bigger step up.\r\n\r\nChanges made: made minor revisions
    to virtually every lc characters and some uc characters. Made all of the horizontal
    thickness slightly thinner as it appears too thick at times. Opened up <em>g</em>
    more, and softened the curves for <em>f, j, t, and y</em>. The <em>X and x</em>
    branches out differently to appear more balanced. All of the numeral characters
    have been modified. I think I may have to continue working on 2, 3, and 5. The
    next revision will have more punctuation.\r\n\r\nAlso, I attached a couple of
    samples of Whisk in use, on bubble gum packaging and on a menu."
