  body: It clearly isn't the typeface in question given it was designed in 1996, but
    give [[http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=97|Filosofia]] a try. Might be a bit too
    clean/digital, I guess.

  body: "Wouldn't you say they used more than one font? If I take a close look at
    the capital R in the bottom left picture, it differs from the one in the picture
    next to it. I'd say any Jensonesk Caslonian Bembo comes close ;-) but I don't
    see a captital W in your snapshots. Is there any change you could upload or link
    one?\r\n"
