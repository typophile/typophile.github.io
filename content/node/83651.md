  body: "It looks quite similar to Suitcase's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/republic/?refby=bowfin\">RePublic</a>,
    which is a slab with a serif-less S, like this. Perhaps there is a custom version
    of the font made for the Magazine?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Yeah, I''m leaning towards a custom font as well. I cant stop staring at
    the way the letter N rests on the baseline. It seems so wide. '
