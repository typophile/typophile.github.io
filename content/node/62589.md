  body: It's certainly not "Times New Roman" but looks along the lines of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/bodoni/fonts/">Bodoni</a>.
    Of course this face is more extended and the "K" is slightly off. Why isn't my

    their wordmark\r\n\r\njust look up didone or modern serif typefaces, you'll find
    something similar\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read
