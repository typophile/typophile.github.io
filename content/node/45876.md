body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nAs refered [[http://typophile.com/node/42228|here]] I started
  a new Sans inpired in those letters...special the \"a\". After some work, please
  find enclosed a PDF for comments...\r\n\r\nI made it without any contrast in lines
  and started to wonder if a little of it won't help the final result. I made a \"abc\"
  in both cases just to give you an ideia here this may go. \r\nPlease feel free to
  ad comments!\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced.\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: You should basically always make a slight contrast. Even if it's just to make
    it optically look contrast-less.

  body: I like it, but i think that a few characters need to be tweaked. Personally,
    i think that the lowercase "c" needs to be wider. Also, the kerning needs quite
    a bit of work. Other than that, i really like how it's coming along. Good luck.

  body: "I think the lower case 'l' and the uppercase 'i' are too thick. You could
    angle the stroke on the 'q'. None of the other strokes are angled like that. Just
    a thought. Other than a few small things like that, i like it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_4_6148.png]"
