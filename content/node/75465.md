body: "The Northern European Type Collaboration Typolar has started. Find us at www.typolar.com.
  Founded by type designers Saku Hein\xE4nen, Jarno Lukkarila and Teemu Ollikainen,
  Typolar operates from Helsinki and London. \r\n\r\nTypolar builds on the Nordic
  tradition of sturdy functionalism. For us it means fresh ideas and practical results.
  Working closely with publishing industries has made our typefaces naturally suitable
  for editorial work. However, many have found them highly useful in branding and
  identities as well. And that\u2019s how we like it.\r\n\r\nWe are launching two
  brand new font families together with our site. Calypso E and Vinkel are both versatile
  and hard-working types with optimized weight ranges,\_extensive character sets and
  useful OpenType features. Calypso E is also available as web fonts.\r\n\r\nYou are
  most welcome to have a closer look at our site! Find our specimen pdfs there.\r\n
