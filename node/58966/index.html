  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles,

We're having a new logo designed by a local agency and they've chosen to put our company name in a custom rounded sans. They said all the stuff you'd expect about a friendly, approachable, modern tone. I wasn't immediately sold on the idea since many companies these days are opting for roundy sans serif fonts (like Xerox using FS Albert). 

So I got to thinking well hey maybe they're right to choose this kind of font, even if everyone else is trying to be personable and informal, why shouldn't we too?

Anyway my two questions are:

1   What fonts would you recommend that are slightly rounded, with simple shapes and a one-storey a? The company name is IMA International and I think they're going to set it with the ima in lowercase and the INTERNATIONAL in uppercase below it.

2   Am I over-worrying about choosing a style that seems to be everywhere or should I be happy that this kind of font does in fact represent our company values?

As always, I look forward to anyone's suggestions.

Thanks :)

PS Can't post an image of their home-made type currently but will try to get the pdf from them.</div>

Yes my company knows I'm a font geek! Maybe that's part of the difficulty because I don't want to sound picky about something nobody else really notices. And if I was the designer I'd hate the client to jump into my territory.

Illustration/logo stuff is not something I can do so I chose to get the agency involved. I really like their logo and the type is passable, I'm just not sold on the idea of the friendly rounded thing and the execution is slightly spotty (no optical correction).

I suppose I could have a go, but there are nine or ten glyphs to create and I don't know if I can do the right 'mood' of font in the time given (a couple of weeks before our 2010 brochure gets finalised). I'll have a go of course but I was really looking for a ready-made font or any opinions whether roundy ones are passé or appropriate. We are a whole lot more personal/organic/unique than Xerox!</div>

Aw Ben… it sounds like you might be a bit too nice to these people.

And for the record, I think your company should value having a specialist 
on board! (I know it's not easy &ndash; but don't try to pretend type doesn't matter 
just so they won't think you're a hopeless geek. ;-) )

<cite>" We are a whole lot more personal/organic/unique than Xerox!"</cite>
Ah, there's a statement to work from!

BTW, FF Cocon randomly popped into my mind, but that's probably not what you want. It's rounded but "different". But maybe not fresh enough.</div>

Nick, sometimes I wish I didn't <em>have</em> to do all of those things at my job ... well, except for the lettering in most cases. Though most of the time it's nice to have the variety.

@Bendy: How rounded are you thinking. I think Volkswagon is currently using VAG Rounded or something similar for their advertising, which I think works beautifully juxtaposed with the precision of their vehicles.</div>

Please bear in mind this is not properly kerned and is just to show how different fonts might work.
And yes, I submitted my own Mint for consideration too...rounded terminals and single-storey a...why not?!
I personally think Bryant and Montag work really nicely.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dude, I think Mint rocks the party. At least in the "ima" &ndash; I'm not quite as sure about the "INTERNATIONAL" where something more monoline might feel more "stable" (or maybe try using your bolder Mint in the subline?).

I think Bryant works quite nicely too, it's just a lot softer, less perky.
Personally I think Montag's too cute, and too wide.

The agency had also removed the tittle from ima, to improve the visual structure I guess. We'll see what they think works best.

		<div class="commentbody">Mint has nice stuff going for it. I think maybe your A is too wide compared to the other caps in INTERNATIONAL. Oh and the up stroke--left diagonal--should probably be thinner to relate well to the N and the horizontals. Try doing each alone and both, in context of course, and see what you like best...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys, I'm thinking we might tell the agency to use Mint, once I've sorted out the spacing and the A and N. There's something weird going on in the R counter too I think.

In terms of process, would I license the font to my company or the design agency who my company is paying to do the logo? I haven't released fonts before so this is exciting and a bit unknown.</div>
