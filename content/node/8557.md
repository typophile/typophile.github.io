  body: ' Hi Jared! <BR> <BR>Thanks for your greetings. <BR>I am a bit surprised by
    your cryptic &#40;&#34;:p&#34;???&#41; reaction. I assumed a message of hope and
    an invitation to get rid of 9-11 horror will be a good way to enter this brand
    new year... <BR> <BR>I want also to make myself clear: I didn&#39;t post this
    e-card to start a polemical discussion but only to sincerely send my greetings.
    <BR> <BR>Happy new year to you too! <BR> <BR>Gerry '
