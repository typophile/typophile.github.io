body: "I found this piece of text somewhere a while back and kept it. I love the letters,
  and thought it could be expanded into a font someday. I thought it looked like Optima
  but cleaner and more dramatic. But before I start, I was wondering if there was
  any chance it was not custom drawn but a font. I'm sure you guys could help.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"

  body: "It sure does resemble to Peignot, but few of the letters look quite different.
    Peignot's \"A\" is pointed and the \"M\" quite wider, the \"R\" is not closed
    and the top stroke of the \"T\" is longer.\r\nOf course, it might have been modified
    and right now I don't have a better candidate."

    is quite close, but now the "M" is wrong

  body: "THank you all for your ideas. Chambrd seems to have more of the voice I was
    looking for that Peignot, but It seems as though Chambord does not have a digital
    version.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know where I could find a good sized sample of the
    character family, especially the lower case?"
