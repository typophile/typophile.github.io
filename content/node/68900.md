  between 1964 and 1968 he studied cinema, architecture, and modern literature in
  C\xF3rdoba, Argentina. During that time he won several first prizes in design contests.
  In 1965 he moved for one year to S\xE3o Paulo, Brazil, to work at the Edit\xF4ra
  Abril where he learned magazine design. In 1967 he was awarded a scholarship to
  study at the HfG Ulm by the German DAAD, but unfortunately the school was closed
  in 1968.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1969 he travelled to Germany with the same scholarship
  and studied at the Visual Communication Institute of the Superior Fine Arts School
  of Hamburg University (IVK-HfbK) between 1970 and 1975. Always a typography lover
  he made some unpublished or unfinished type designs between 1968 and 1989.\r\n\r\nIn
  1991, while living and working in Valencia, Spain, he acquired a Mac and all the
  necessary software to take the first steps in digital type design. As a result of
  the process since 1995 he has published 12 typefaces with ITC.\r\n\r\nAt the moment
  works and teaches graphic design and typography privately in C\xF3rdoba, Argentina.\r\n\r\nFonts
