body: "I want to ligate the bejeezus out of a font, or find a font out of which the
  bejeezus has already been ligated.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm thinking of is mechanical single-line
  lettering like the inside line of the CNN logo (the \"cable\" in the Cable News
  Network), something you could theoretically craft out of neon tubing or engrave
  with a rotary tool.\r\n\r\nThe caps in <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/bryant/\">Bryant</a>
  are close to workable, except for letters like \"C\", which would need to terminate
  horizontally to be connected to, say, a \"T.\" I'm sure I'll end up creating these
  letters myself, but it would be nice to see how others have done it, to get a sense
  of what I want to emulate or do differently."

  body: Thank you, that's along the right lines, but I'm hoping for something closer
    to a basic, unadorned sans, but connected. Expletive is a bit curly and FIG is
    a bit angular for me.

  body: "Heh, worth a shot.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting proposition. There are plenty
    of sans faces now including ligatures in their character sets, but they tend to
    be just for standard letter combinations or just alternative presentations of
    characters (for example, an LL lig where the second l is shorter and sits inside
    the first).\r\n\r\nThe new(ish) ITC Avant Garde Gothic Pro restores all the classic
    ligatures, in OpenType, that have been unavailable for years. There are ligs of
    both the above types in the mix, but perhaps they will prove useful. I fear that
    you may have to bite the bullet and create your own type, or heavily customise
    an existing one. Remember that, short of using a script face (like the ones I
    post above), typographers cannot logistically create ligs for every conceivable
    combination of characters.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=itc+avant+garde+gothic+pro\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: Well, I suppose a font that has already done the work for me would be a challenge
    along the lines of <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/edbenguiatfonts">Ed
    Interlock</a>. But one that provides the basic shapes and lets me do the connecting
    would be useful.
