  ago. My intention was to make it suitable for small sizes from about 7 to 9 points.
  Hope you like it. \r\n\r\nBy the way: It is named after a character of The Godfather.
  Just like my other typeface Im working on at the moment http://typophile.com/node/55850."

  body: "Very good. I think the \"g\" is a little to narrow and timid, actually. And
    the thinness of the verticals of \"4\" and \"7\" is perhaps more suitable for
    a display typeface than for one intended for footnotes. \r\n\r\nThere's something
    very familiar with the top serifs of mnpr and the ascending glyphs ... Mercury
    Text, perhaps? That's not a problem, but I somehow feel that serif is vaguely
    out of context with the rest of the typeface, but that might just be me."

  body: "Thank you for your comments so far.\r\n\r\nDidn`t had much time to work on
    it but I made a few little changings and uploaded a new pdf (002). Mainly changing
    some sidebearings and making the inktraps a bit wider. Think it is a bit more
    readable now in smaller sizes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Z\xFCgel_3598.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    top one is the old. I widend the g, broadend the ? and gave the letters like Z
    etc a sharp inner corner.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0123456789_5519.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I changed the numerals a bit and added old style numerals"

  body: "This is very harmonious already. Lovely work!\r\nI'm also a learner so take
    my comments with a dab of salt...\r\nI'm slightly concerned about the wide N and
    narrow W. Lowercase w is a slight bit narrow too? And I'd make the tail on the
    comma a tiny bit longer. Bottom of G looks a bit heavy? And perhaps the terminal
    of the tail on y could be heavier?\r\n\r\n"
