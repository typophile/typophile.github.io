  body: These characters are clearly based on the late 18th / early 19th century French
    models. The bowl of the P is typical of Didot, but the ball terminal of the R
    is not. Also, the swing of the 9 is atypical of the period. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    probably a Didot of some sort, but none of the readily available versions that
    I could find -- Linotype Didot, HTF Didot, Ludlow Didot, Ambroise -- has these
    idiosyncratic features. Perhaps someone with more time will be able to track it
    down for you. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: You can use FF&#39;s font-tester to check that it is indeed  <BR>Bodoni Classic.
    BTW, this design reminds me a little  <BR>of a face that I&#39;ve never seen in
    use &#40;in fact, that I&#39;ve  <BR>never seen at all but for a small sample
    in a magazine  <BR>years ago&#41; that&#39;s Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s Grazia Bodoni.
