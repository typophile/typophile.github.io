  body: For anyone who wants to purchase this and doesn&#39;t know, 1 YEN is almost
    a penny in US dollars. So just move the decimal two places to your left. <BR>
    <BR>Just a public service announcement.

  body: I have a copy sitting here next to me, and I can say that it is as rich as
    John Berry describes. From the wildly Porchez cover to the somewhat short current
    typefoundry list &#40;the only thing I believe to be a flaw&#41;. Worth it for
    all typophile&#39;s to at least consider adding to this year&#39;s wish list.

  body: This looks great! <BR>Unfortunately the shipping cost &#40;to the US&#41;
    almost doubled the price, so I&#39;ll have to wait. Hopefully not for Godot though.

  body: Tiffany, it&#39;s difficult to see from John&#39;s review but is most of the
    content recycled &#40;like the Crewdson piece&#41;, or does it appear to be fresh
    content?

  body: Simon, I am guilty of not having read it cover to cover yet. You can <a href="http://www.idea-mag.com/cgi-bin/book/catalog.cgi?language=en&amp;item=305"
    target="_blank">see more</a> at the IDEA site.  <BR> <BR>I would guess that the
    problem most of you will have is that if you do follow the type designers included
    in this issue you might already know most of what they are saying from conversations
    or articles touching on similar things elsewhere. <BR> <BR>There is an interesting,
    though not deep, article on the take on &#34;Stanley Morison as previously introduced
    in Japan&#34; ... a little light if you have read other books, but a nice refresher
    nonetheless, with the added bonus of being from an Eastern point of view. <BR>
    <BR>I now will make a point of doing my homework and actually reading the rest--I&#39;ve
    read both Kinross&#39; and Jf&#39;s already--of the magazine. <BR> <BR>&#40;Do
    I get points for such a long run-on sentence?&#41;

  body: I enjoyed reading the summary of Akira Kobayashi&#39;s article in Berry&#39;s
    feature. Very interesting the comment about Bauer Bodoni
