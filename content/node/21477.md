body: "I'm looking for software that will help me print a font specimen book. I used
  to use \"the Type Book\" (by Jim Lewis) back in the Mac OS 7.0 through 9 days. Hey,
  it was old school, but it worked brilliantly. Is there something similar available
  now for Mac OSX?\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like to gang up 12 or more specimens per
  page. It would be fantastic if I didn't have to activate fonts to print them, but
  I'm aware that might be asking too much.\r\n\r\nI look forward to reading your suggestions.\r\n\r\nTIA-\r\ncheers-\r\nKayt"
