  body: "Through QuarkXPress - it breaks down as Patty has put it 100C 88M 20K. But
    that is for Pantone Color Solid Coated and Uncoated. (Though the coated is a bright
    purple and the uncoated is a dusty blue.) \r\n\r\nIn the actual Pantone Color
    Formula Guide on how to make the color it reads: (this would have to be for spot
    color) \r\n12 parts Pantone Blue 072 -70.6\r\n,75 part Pantone Black -4.4 and...\r\n4.5
    parts Pantone Trans White -25\r\n\r\nand that is the secret to why a PMS color
    that we see doesn't print looking like we thought it would. I checked with my
    Pantone Process Simulator - (great book shows you how each color prints on coated
    and uncoated stocks - and how far off the PMS guide really is) but sorry, it only
    goes to PMS 600. \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to get close in a print job to the
    swatch of 662 - you may want to add about 20y and up the k to 30 or 40 - (that
    from hubby, the retired color separator...)"

  body: "Those deep rich blues are one of the worst colors to accomplish in the CMYK
    gamut. They get muddy. I use Michael and Pat Rogondino's <em>Process Color Manual</em>
    to estimate PMS conversions. There are a few blues in the manual that will come
    close to that, none of them will look exactly right on screen. Each has a shift
    one way or the other, so a compromise has to be made. My first pick was 100c 100m
    10y 0k. My next look was 100c 90m 0y 10k. \r\n\r\nAre you going to a printer?
    Ask them. Almost every production source I use has extensively tested their equipment
    and know the best color estimation their machinery will achieve.\r\n\r\n"
