body: "I am decorating my room and I want to use the word \u201Eedelabsteige\u201C.
  So, it is not a logo, but it will be shown on the wall and it will be approx. 1.5
  meters long.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am posting this is that I am not sure how to draw
  the \x1E\u201Eg\u201C. Somehow it seems that none of these shapes fit the style
  of the other letters. Does anybody have an idea how to solve this?\r\n\r\nAny comments
  appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edelabsteige_v1_4779.jpg]"

    same angle as \u2018s\u2019), you can mirror it to form the loop of the \u2018g\u2019. "

  body: I somehow tried this in example number two, but it didn't look right. I have
    done it again, in two steps, but the bottom part of the g feels to narrow and
    the connection to the e doesn't work smooth. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/edelabsteige_v2_6239.jpg]

    & the ''s'' might not be worth playing with (rotated down)... that ''elbow curve''
    might be an elegant solution.'

  body: 'I think you are the right track expanding on #2.  I agree the bottom part
    of the g is a little too narrow against the other letter forms, but I tend to
    think the connection to the e is best with no disconnect as you did in #4.  Nice
    job on the type design!'

    curve. \r\nThanks doubledaggers for the hint with the 'b' and 's' thing. I definitely
    like the look, but not so much the connection to 'e'.\r\n\r\nHere are my versions

    shorter, seeing how short the ascenders are? I''m thinking something in the direction
    of #3 or #6/#8/#13 but much flatter. Dunno if it''d work, just an idea.'

    could cleave it in two pieces and mirror it on the opposite wall. And I think,
    that it would look better on a smooth wall. Putting woodchip wallpaper on the
    front could be an alternative. In the same color as the wall."
