  body: Congratulations on the new site, it's really tops! Is Now Playing part of
    the Clearview family as well? It looks like it's related but perhaps its just
    that you always have to use the same clever tricks to make signage type very legible?
    I usually love your work but I must admit that Tangent is an exception. The agency
    I work at has already got Avenir and Verlag and it's hard to tell how yours is
    better. I wish your font previewer could set the type even bigger so I could really
    appreciate all the lovely details especially in Enclave! It would be nice to see
    the fonts in other colours as well but I understand that the programming for that
    must be really hard.

    Enclave yet. Very beautiful little slab serif. I suppose my only wish would be
    for PDFs so I can really look at it. '

  body: "Except for a few magazine ads, this is the first time Enclave is being shown.\r\n\r\nNow
    Playing is its own design, not related to Clearview at all.\r\n\r\nTangent is
    different than the geometrics Nigella mentions, I have to think that what makes
    it better is that I did it. \r\n\r\nHow big should a type previewer set? If you
    navigate down to the individual font it will set to 60 pt.\r\n\r\nWe are forgoing
    PDF's for the moment, but are in the final stages of developing a nice print promo.
    If you would like to get one when it is ready sign up on the home page."

    of type designers that I always hear about! Maybe that doesn't apply to yanks.
    I didn't realize you considered yourself such a better designer than Zapf or Hoeffler!
    This attitude is a bit of a turnoff really."

  body: "Nigella, James is a great guy actually. And I suspect his comments merely
    amounted to healthy self respect as far as he was concerned. I know cultural differences
    can be hard to grip in general, we all fumble there I think. And all the more
    so in email and by text. \r\n\r\nAlso, think of it this way: if you don't ever
    hope in some corner of your heart to be better than your hero, how can you ever
    try? Perhaps you'll fail - yes. But giving it your best shot is important. And
    if some us carry that sentiment on our sleeve & others don't then so bit it. I
    am not sure there is much harm in being forthright. And lastly this myth of self
    effacement in type designers is just that. Sure Dwiggins was a sweetie from what
    we can tell. But not everybody was. Some designers have been pretty severe! And
    I would not like to be without their designs I can tell you!\r\n\r\nI'll be signing
    up for that promo."

    of my favorite features of your old site.\r\n\r\nAs to this comment: <em>I have
    to think that what makes it better is that I did it.</em>\r\n\r\nJames didn't
    mean it the way some of you may think. If a type designer (or any creative person)
    doesn't on some level think they're doing something with their own personal touch...then
    really what is the point? It wasn't a statement of being better than anyone else.
    \r\n\r\nI'm also a former Brooklynite so perhaps I understand the language. :)\r\n"

    sort of type catalog, but a sort of cookbook. For lack of a better term.\r\n\r\nNigella,
    both Eben and Terry have got the point.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the future maybe it would
    be better to ask how a design is different, or in what way appropriate, rather
    than which is better.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your comments."

  body: "Dear Terminal Design,\r\n\r\nI've just noticed the website. Alot of very
    interesting things.\r\n\r\nI was interested in your versions of PERPETUA and GILL
    SANS. Several years ago I was approached about reviving the same faces for a large
    French governmental agency. Following standard protocol, I approached Monotype
    for their approval. They wanted a large sum of money for a license even though
    I wasn't going to start with their outlines. That is their right of course, but
    the agency could not afford the license plus the custom development fees.\_Did
    you find such a problem? Or do Conde Nast deal with this problem? Will these fonts
    eventually be released to the general public? Why did Conde Nast commision another
    hairline Gill Sans when they had commisioned one already for British Vogue? Si
    Neuhouse must have more sense than money! And yes, I too thought it was odd that
    a French organization wanted revivals of classic British typefaces!\r\n\r\nI also
    enjoyed your comments about your clients for Miller. Is this the same agency that
    I am thinking of? I did some work for them many years ago with similar results.
    I must applaud your insult of them!\_I wish I had so many clients and enough money
    to be able to insult them like you have. Brooklyn attitude indeed! Bravo!\r\n\r\nDid
    we meet at the 1989 AIGA conference in San Antonio? I met a fellow type designer
    from Brooklyn at that conference but my memory has faded. Old age strikes again!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph
    T. Burke"

  body: "Randolph,\r\n\r\nConde Nast handles all of these sort of things. The British
    and the American versions of Vogue are completely separate entities and do not
    share resources, as far as I have been told. The fonts are the property of Conde
    Nast and will never be released to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe agency and the
    art directors are to remain nameless. The ADs are all off doing other things these
    days. I didn't say anything on my website that I did not say to them when the
    logo was published. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this poaching of developmental drawings
    goes on all the time. A colleague of mine has a clause in his contracts that forbids
    this sort of thing. I am thinking of incorporating such a clause in my future
    agreements.\r\n\r\nI have never been to an AIGA conference so you must have me
    confused with another person.\r\n\r\nJames"

    with any digital data or even better, drawings? Or did you have a chance to examine
    drawings at St Bride or the Malin punches at Cambridge University Press. Conde
    Nast must have paid a large amount of money to Monotype for the priviledge. Did
    you have a chance to work with Robin Nicholas? I ve heard he is a very friendly
    gentleman. Its a shame your Perpetua will not be released. Perhaps you can post
    a PDF for everyone to see your fine work.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"

    the work is modeled on Perpetua it is not \"Perpetua\". It was done in about three
    or four weeks and I used some old reference I had here at the studio. The art
    director didn't even know what they were asking for was called Perpetua, since
    they were using a Bitstream version of the design (with a different name)for their
    text composition. \r\nMy agreements with Conde Nast limit me from providing many
    samples. The ones on my website will have to do. I don't think the typographic
    world will miss not having access to it. \r\n\r\nJames"

    worked in a design bureau for quite some time. The pennypinchers upstairs don't
    care about 'different' when I ask them to spend over 200 quid. They want to know
    why it's better!! Surely you understand what I mean. It's not important anyway
    because I don't like the family very much.\r\n\r\nThanks for previewing in even
    larger sizes! This will do wonders for talking my mates at work into Enclave for
    our next project! Now I can show off all the little details. I didn't realize
    it had rounded corners and this makes me like it even more because they're so
    trendy right now! Come to think of it I'd love a rounded Clearview too.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
