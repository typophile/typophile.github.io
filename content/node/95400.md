  body: "Would really like to know too. Looks very close to some Futura. I firstly
    thought about [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ars_type/ars_maquette_pro_complete/|Maquette]]
    (using alternate /l and /a) but really too far (too many details remain off: /a,
    numerals, /w and almost all uppercases).\r\nFoam uses many fonts on its website
    and possibly mixed up:\r\n- Arial as html font\r\n- [[http://lineto.com/The%20Fonts/Font%20Categories/Text%20Fonts/Brown/|LL
    Brown]] for some graphics including [[http://www.foam.org/media/2817074/08-053%20fm%20media%20kit.pdf|press
    kit]]\r\n- possibly some [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/futura-bq/|Futura]]
    and/or the mystery font you're after (closer look [[http://www.foam.org/media/3443692/08-012-27_issue31_outnow.jpg|here]],
    not sure for the numerals though on this one and [[http://www.foam.org/media/3437371/banner%20talent%20callpresswebthumb.jpg|here]])
    which could be a modified Futura...\r\nThe closest I have for \"Foam Album 10\"
    would be [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/betatype/apertura_complete_ot/|Apertura]]."
