  first font, since there's nobody around at the academy where i study who knows or
  uses fontlab the learning process for me is verry slame as it is a verry complex
  program...i bought the book Leslie Cabarga's book and its great but i was wondering
  if annyone over here knows if i could follow some fontlab courses/trainings over
  here in Belgium. fonts and font design is something that i'm really pasionate about
  and would really like to speed up the learning proces...it would also be grat to
  have people pointing me out the thing i'm doing wrong while working in photoshop
  and ofcourse a book doesn't really do that.\r\n\r\nmaybe even if there are some
  people from Belgium over here whom work with fontlab and have some spare time to
  give some lessons...ofcourse i'ill pay for them, i'm not asking for a free ride
  in no way...just wanna learn :D"

  body: So I asked around and couldn't find anyone yet who's able to give private
    courses. And I don't think there are any public courses (except in eductaional
    programmes like Type and Media at KABK and such).
