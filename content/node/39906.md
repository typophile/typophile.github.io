body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Cursive</strong>\r\n\r\nBeing Cursive
  is a property of [[typography]] and [[Calligraphy]] which implies a certain inclination
  or angular tilt, either positive or negative, relative to the orthogonal \"y\" axis.\r\n\r\nIn
  type, both [[Oblique]] and [[Italic]] are Cursive in the sense that they imply some
  sort of inclination, somehow reminiscent of written language. Other examples of
  Cursive may include some [[Script]] types."
