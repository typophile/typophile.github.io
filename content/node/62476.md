  body: I agree in the TypeTool suggestion. Very similar to Fontlab and cheaper. A
    very good choice for starters.

  body: So does it just do the basics of making the letters into a font? I guess that
    is about all I want but then again if there are features that FLS has as far as
    helping you see how each letters work together.. lining them up etc.. then I wouldnt
    mind having that.

  body: "If you want to draw some glyphs but do not need every possible advanced feature,
    get TypeTool. It is is inexpensive and you will be able to draw a complete typeface.
    If you want the challenge of a more complex and sophisticated interface with every
    feature, get FontLab.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Fontographer is that while it seems
    like a nice middle ground, it is rarely updated. The last update was in 2006 so
    it's obsolete in software terms, and it will not import or export the Open Type
    file format unless you purchase FogLamp for an additional $79. In my opinion,
    the ability to work with OTF files in today's world is critical. TypeTool gives
    you this functionality for $99. Also worth mentioning is that if you use a PC,
    Fontographer has established problems with operating systems 2000 and on. Don't
    get Fontographer.\r\n\r\nYou asked what does FontLab Studio have that Fontographer
    does not. The short answer is: a lot of \"behind the scenes stuff\" that matters
    to professional typographers but does not matter much to casual hobbyists and
    beginners. It is truly too much to explain in one breath if you are first starting
    out. Run some Google searches (FontLab Studio 5 versus Fontographer) to find some
    specifics and read FontLab's website for more information on the differences.\r\n\r\nFrom
    what you wrote above, I would purchase TypeTool if I were you. FontLab Studio
    will be too much software for you. Just because TypeTool is inexpensive does not
    mean it is a poor piece of software lacking in features you will need.\r\n\r\nIf
    you enjoy drawing letters on paper and wish to \"vectorize\" those drawings you
    may also wish to consider ScanFont ($99 also from FontLab). This means you would
    have two programs: TypeTool and ScanFont."

    drawn in Illustrator into fonts and it has a Metrics and Kerning window which
    is what you mean when you talk about seeing how the letters work together. Once
    you become comfortable with the interface, you will probably draw your glyphs
    directly in TypeTool."

    called a \"metrics\" window. Font Tool does all the basic stuff--drawing, spacing,
    kerning, generating fonts. FontLab Studio adds more advanced features that professional
    font developers need. It's like the difference between Photoshop Elements and
    Photoshop. Or between a scooter and a motorcycle."

    least on OS X) and has a similarly overcomplicated interface due to being one
    app with way too many functions. And it\u2019s an old-school X app, so it looks
    pretty gross, which is pretty off putting for a design tool that needs to be used
    for hours at a time. I\u2019ve tried switching a few times and always went back
    to Flab. "

    most people find it harder to use than FontLab Studio (which is scary, because
    FLS is not exactly the easiest tool to become proficient at).\r\n\r\nBut you can
    try out FontForge, FontLab Studio, TypeTool and Fontographer, as they all have

    I really tired to get my head around, but it was glitchy and hurt my eyes."

  body: "There are many people for whom FontForge is not the right tool; it's not
    for the faint of heart or for those who require an aesthetically pleasing work
    environment (the same might be said for Linux in general...), and it does like
    to crash on occasion (although there's rarely any data loss, as it backs up your
    work regularly).  The author warns that it should be considered perpetual beta
    software which will probably never see a stable release.  But if you're already
    using Linux and are willing to put up with the somewhat steep learning curve and
    the ugly-as-sin, overcomplicated interface, it may be the right tool for you.\r\n\r\nFontForge
    and Inkscape can be a particularly nice combination, since FontForge can import
    SVG images directly.  FontForge is also the only tool I know of with support for
    Raph Levien's Spiro (I generally find B\xE9zier curves easier, but the point is
    that in FontForge both are available, assuming you've installed Spiro).  Another
    area where FontForge outshines the competition is combining diacritical marks;
    after an initial setup, adding anchors to base glyphs and diacritics is as easy
    as adding any other point.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's not out of the question to begin
    your font development in, say, TypeTool, then use FontForge to add more advanced
    features.  This workflow won't appeal to most people, but it's available nonetheless."
