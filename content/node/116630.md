  body: "The latin is nice and creative. I don't know enough about hiragana, but you
    clearly have two different styles based on different stroke-rounding methods,
    and the second looks very ragged. Maybe this is of necessity. But consider making
    another version in which the numerals and symbols are sized and styled to match
    the latin.\r\n\r\nYou seem to have mistakenly filled \u013D\u013E with a copy
    of \u0139\u013A.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, cerulean :). I noticed the \u013D\u013E error after
    posting the sample. I already corrected them. \r\nThe latin are of 6x6 grid while
    the numbers are in 7x7. I think I will modify the latin so that they are 7x7 while
    retaining the style...\r\nThe hiragana is still in progress so I may modify the
    corners and strokes... Katakana is also planned...\r\n\r\nIs it prefered to keep
    all glyphs in a constant nxn grid in a single font?..."
