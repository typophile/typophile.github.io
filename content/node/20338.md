    the shorter cross-strokes that I realised it was AGOFM. :^)"

  body: Ha. I also thought the cross-strokes looked a little high, but figured it
    could be a pixel thing or just my bleary eyes playing tricks at the end of a long
    day staring at the screen.

  body: "As to the Perpetua, Perpetua's numbers are all \"above the line\" - Perpetua
    Experts numbers straddle and are below the line.\r\n\r\nI like Perpetua's lettering
    and Perpetua Expert's numbers - is there any way to \"combine\" these into a single,
    easily usable font?\r\n\r\nUsing Perpetua and then editing all the numbers to
    PE seems extremely tedious.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"
