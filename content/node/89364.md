  of some of the best question marks.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on the visual design
  of a help system, and I'm looking for a clean question mark that looks good on its
  own as an icon (even at 12x12 pixels).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the design uses the classic
  Univers at the 45 weight (which is my preferred non-Helvetica Helvetica), but I
  don't really like the shape of its question mark when it stands on its own.\r\n\r\nTw
  Cen MT Bold looks otherwise good, but with the rest of the design being light grays,
  hairlines and Light Univers, it's a bit too fat. And the Regular Tw Cen MT has an
  entirely different shape for its question mark.\r\n\r\nWhat would you use for such
  a circumstance?"

    latter is of course much trickier to pull off.\r\n\r\nBTW, check out Font Aid

  body: "Thank you for you reply, hrant!\r\n\r\nHeadlines and other large copy is
    set in Univers 45, body text in Lucida Sans. It doesn't necessarily need to harmonize
    with these fonts, but just generally fit in with the thin line and light gray
    elegance.\r\n\r\nFont Aid II looks interesting based on a character map I found
    in an old news article... however most of these are probably too ornate and complex
    to fit into a minimally minute icon."
