  for a typographical contest in 1910 and later published by Nebiolo in 1924. It's
  an interesting font, but I can not find pictures or catalogs: I found only this
  picture of the italics on the internet. None of you happen to have some more pictures?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tanagra
