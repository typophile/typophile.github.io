  to undertake the risky adventure of a marriage, I uploaded a hires scan of a beautiful
  large-scale Renaissance woodcut-flyleaf by Hans Sachs dated 1549 and cut in a Schwabacher
  blackletter typeface.\r\n\r\nTop half of flyleaf: Woodcut with this heading:\r\n<strong>\"A
  useful advice to those apprentices who want to marry\"</strong>\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/hans-sachs-rat1.gif\r\n\r\nBottom
  half of flyleaf: Poem with this heading:\r\n<strong>\"Advice concerning three types
  of marriage\"</strong>\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/hans-sachs-rat2.gif\r\n\r\nThe
  three types of marriage for punch-cutters are these:\r\n- Firstly, marriage of a
  young and beautiful, but poor maiden.\r\n- Secondly, marriage of a rich widow, who
  was married once.\r\n- Thirdly, marriage of a very rich widow, who was married twice.\r\nGuess,
  which type of marriage is considered by Hans Sachs as least troublesome for font-makers
  and punch-cutters?"
