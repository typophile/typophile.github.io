body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ni would like some suggestions from you experts about some good typefaces
  i can consider for the blog of a journalist.\r\n\r\nI think will go with a classic
  grid/typographic style (eg. shauninman.com, subtraction.com) but i want to avoid
  a newspaper look.\r\n\r\nThe blog need to be authoritative but modern (not trendy)
  but i'd like a little injection of a classic feeling (maybe the coupling of a  serif
  and a sans-serif?).\r\n\r\nI am open to all your suggestions, if you feel you need
  more details to help me let me know, and I will try to provide.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\nGiuliano "

    paragraphs to use rendered as png or with sifr, for body copy i will use default
    system fonts avalaible to the browsers.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I will try to keep it short:\r\n\r\nI work as front-end developer and also
    a bit as designer for the web from 5 years.\r\n\r\nFrom this autumn I will go
    freelance to cultivate my other old passion: writing & journalism.\r\n\r\nI will
    collaborate professionally with a newspaper and a magazine but I want to have
    a blog too, where writing freely about themes I care.\r\n\r\nThe blog will host
    posts about my interests: sociology, philosophy, politics & literature. Mainly
    editorials, opinions and some reviews of books I read.\r\n\r\nI want to give the
    site a very minimal and effective design with usability & legibility in mind,
    BUT i don't want the blog to feel too classic or newspaper-like (a thing that
    often happens when going to the grid&typography classic look on the web).\r\n\r\nI
    would like the site to look modern BUT not trendy (not something that could feel
    outdated a year or two from now).\r\n\r\nOther weblogs i like are: <a href=\"www.wilsonminer.com\">wilsonminer</a>
    and <a href=\"http://informationarchitects.jp/\">informationarchitects</a>.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    (not sure still) I will go for very big type (16px) for article body copy (only
    on the page of the single post), in this case a serif font will be needed for
    the body copy (again only on the single post page).\r\n\r\nI hope i gave you enoguh
    information.\r\n\r\nGiuliano"

  body: How about <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham/inuse">Farnham</a>?
    It has a myriad of weights and styles, it can be both serious and decorative.

  body: "Farnham is a very good suggestion, but perhaps a little overused these days?
    I'd take a look at [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=88|Eudald]],
    which is distantly related (Farnham is loosely based on the types of Johann Fleischmann,
    while Eudald is a revival of his Spanish imitator Eudald Pradell's types. The
    web page doesn't mention OT versions of the typefaces, but I know M\xE1rio Feliciano
    started working on them more than a year ago. They're probably finished long ago
    now)."

    Do you think it may fit? I'm attracted by it.

  body: 'I think all Feliciano''s typefaces are of very high quality, Morgan included.
    All its variants, weights and widths make for a very interesting type family.
    It might perhaps not be the best choice for copious amounts of small text. And
    you need an OpenType font, I don''t know Morgan is converted yet. Send an e-mail
    and ask, and ask for an extensive specimen, too. '

  body: "Base your decision on how the face looks in an online type tester, for reasons
    such as the fact that sifr does not support kerning or tracking.\r\n\r\nSo the
    display styles of <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/brown.html\">Brown Gothic</a>
    might be good for a sans headline, as they are tightly fitted.\r\n\r\nOther Shinntype
    news faces with display styles: Nicholas, Pratt, Walburn, Worldwide.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I would say, make your headlines big, using display faces, because it will create
    a more sophisticated quality than what people are used to when they see default
    web faces blown up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
