  factor I haven't considered.\r\n\r\nI've been extending one of my fonts and adding
  glyphs with double storey accents like Latin Capital O with circumflex and tilde.\r\n\r\nWhen
  testing the font in InDesign with auto leading I've noticed that some accents collide\r\n\r\n
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4162.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs it normal to have accent
  touching like this?\r\n\r\nShould I adjust the Additional vertical Metrics, or something
  else to stop this happening?\r\n\r\nIs it acceptable to have this occur with double
  storey accents?\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\n\r\nI
  have set the Additional Vertical metrics like this:\r\n\r\n1. WinAscent value is
  the height of the highest point in the font, so this height will cover all the double
  storey accent.\r\n2. WinDescent is the level that will include all the accents below.\r\n3.
  Ascender = WinAscent and Descender = WinDeccent\r\n4. TypoLineGap = WinAscent +
  WinDescent - UPM (1000)\r\n5. Line Gap = 0\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5265.jpg]"

  body: I'll be interested to hear what others think as my font has similar issues.
    I think for languages like Vietnamese with lots of double accents, extra leading
    is a common solution.

  body: "InDesign's auto leading is entirely independent of font metrics. It is a
    percentage of point size (default 120%), which can be edited in InDesign preferences
    (I usually set mine to 125% as I set a lot of 12/15 text). So changing font vertical
    metrics will not affect InDesign at all.\r\n\r\nFont metrics will affect a lot
    of other applications though, such as word processors, browsers etc.\r\n\r\nYour
    settings look okay to me."

    when composing with lots of double accents, extra leading is common practice.
