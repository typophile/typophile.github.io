body: "Super vague description but here it goes:\r\n\r\n\u2022 They had a really beautiful
  old french script font.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The website was comprised of floating old
  Apple OS windows, where you select a nav option and then it pop up another OS window
  for secondary nav.\r\n\r\n\u2022 when you tested a font it would place the words
  over the canvas/screen on little rectangles (like those fridge magnets) and you
  could alter color of background/foreground.\r\n\r\n\u2022 they didn't have a lot
  of fonts.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nWould love some help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
