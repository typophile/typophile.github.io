body: "hello all,\r\na question about fontographer 5 (already known from previous
  versions)...:\r\n\r\ni'm in the process of converting one of my type families from
  1000upm to 2048upm.  since that is not exactly 2x1000, all my points and sidebearings
  are slightly off and have fractional values.  when i \"align points to grid\" (also
  with option key pressed), the left sidebearings become integer values again, but
  the right ones do not.  so far i'm fixing each one individually, which also fixes
  the total width.... but when working on 10 styles, it becomes endless.  isn't there
  any command that would round them all off at once?\r\n\r\n....the same question
  applies to kerning values --\r\n\r\nif not in fontographer, can it be done in fontlab
  studio?\r\n\r\nthx much,\r\njoachim"

    only works with integers, I assume that if you open/save in FLAB it will probably
    do everything for you. "

  body: FontForge has a "round to integers" option for that kind of problems, there
    is also a font generation option to do the rounding while generating the font.

  body: "thank you gents!!\r\n\r\nre fog:  i admit the command only says \"align points\"
    and not sidebearings.  getting an integer left bearing is just a side benefit
    of aligning the outlines.  but being able to round right bearings and kerning
    would also rock.  i usually copy and paste outlines created in illustrator, and
    that's where the fractioning also occurs of course.\r\n\r\nwhat is the benefit
    of fog being capable of fractional values?\r\n\r\nre fontlab: ah good thought,
    i'll try cross-saving.  so great that fog now also \"speaks\" vfb format."

    theory it allows you to do work without rounding errors, and only deal with the
    rounding errors when you finally lock all of the points down."

  body: My question would be, why do you need to have an upm size of 2048 in the first
    place? I'd just go for 2000 upm and save myself the trouble.

  body: "Joachim, \r\n\r\nWindows TT can have any UPM size from 16 to 32,767. This
    includes values such as 4096, 4000, 2048, 2000, 1024, 1000, 512, 500, or even
    11234 or 435 or 300 or 112. Whatever you want. \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of .ttf
    fonts these days has the UPM size of 1000, just like .otf fonts. A fraction (but
    sizable fraction) has the value of 2048. Other values are rather uncommon. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
