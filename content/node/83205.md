body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a basic question regarding weights...\r\n\r\nI recently
  purshased a typeface from an independant designer, I created a \"custom\" version
  of it, minor changes. And I also created an alternate version where all the dots
  are round instead of square... So I have 3 versions.. Original + Custom + Alt.\r\n\r\nThe
  original came as a Win Truetype/Opentype TT file.\r\n\r\nHow do I make the original
  .ttf file contain my 2 new versions, in order to have 1 menu with multiple weights,
  in InDesign for example...\r\n\r\nI looked through the manual but I'm not very familiar
  with the terminology yet, so I can't really find anything...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    will know to group them together based on all the names encoded into the font
    (which can be set under \"Font Info\" in FontLab). How do you know how to set
    up the names? You read this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontNaming-kltf.pdf\r\n\r\nIt
    looks complicated, because it is. But following that step by step should get the
    results you want."

    Sets.
