    just checked it. I took Ellen L's thinking with type website as my example as
    it contains awfully small text(I am in my early 20s and both my eyes and head
    hurt if I read that website for some time & god knows about elders) I compared
    the same text in both the web browsers and as you can clearly see*, IE10's rendering
    is far superior than Firefox's( I am assuming that FF uses Dwrite and not GDI
    http://blog.mozilla.org/nattokirai/2011/08/11/directwrite-text-rendering-in-firefox-6/).
    \r\nSo, Thomas I think what you said might be wrong as the render quality is pretty
    good in IE10 and this is on windows 7 BTW). The left one is Firefox 17 and right
    is IE10 both on windows 7\r\n*<a href=\"http://postimage.org/image/ubwhdckmt/\">The
    comparison Image</a>\r\nUPDATE: I did read at some forums that after enabling
    directwrite, the fonts look fuzzy and light. Google Chrome 22 doesn't use DirectWrite
    and I have compared it with both Frefox17 and IE10 which uses DirectWrite. I observed
    that IE10s rendering beats both firefox and chrome while firefox is slightly better(almost
    negligibly) than chrome. I am attaching the images here but the difference is
    not really noticeable. You have to check it for yourself.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.freeimagehosting.net/fltfi\"><img

    It looks like two different versions of ClearType: the two on the left are consistent,
    but the one on the right is lighter. I used a zoom tool to examine the pixel colouring.\r\n\r\nAs
    I recall, when FireFox introduced DWrite support, it was not on by default, but
    needed to be set in preferences. I don't know whether they changed this in more
    recent builds. Unless one knows enough to be able to spot the differences between
    GDI and DWrite versions of ClearType, the best way to determine which is in use
    is to look at CFF PostScript fonts: under GDI these will have crappy greyscale
    rendering, under DWrite they will have ClearType rendering."

    proverbial foot in my mouth again.(Thomas you were right)\r\n1) Windows 8 Metro
    interface(the start screen and all the metro apps) use grayscale subpixel rendering.
    They are using this as RGB subpixel rendering is not optimized for both Portrait
    and Landscape mode and moving text during animations\r\n2) Windows 8 desktop environment
    still uses the subpixel RGB rendering though desktop IE10 uses greyscale subpixel
    rendering.\r\n3) Some applications can still access the the old GDI rendering\r\n\r\nOkay
    I hope I am right in all the above cases\r\nand now coming back to the experiment.
    I compared the text rendering of small text on all the three browsers in  desktop
    mode of windows 8. You can clearly see the grayscale rendering of IE10 vs the
    RGB rendering of FFand Chrome \r\n<a href=\"http://img4.imagetitan.com/img.php?image=5_grayscalevssubpixelrendering.jpg\"

    like the subpixel grayscale rendering as it reduces jaggedness at the larger sizes.\r\nIE10
    uses grayscale rendering  and the antialising is very good when compared chrome's
    and firefox's RGB rendering which is poor.\r\n<a href=\"http://img4.imagetitan.com/img.php?image=5_kerncomapre.png\"

    it's important to note with regard to (2) that there is not just \"the\" subpixel
    RGB rendering. There is GDI ClearType, and DirectWrite ClearType. DirectWrite
    ClearType is much better than GDI ClearType.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot you posted
    shows Metro's Grayscale ClearType in IE 10. But the FF17 and Chrome23 samples
    are definitely showing GDI ClearType, and not DirectWrite ClearType. One can tell
    by the lack of Y-direction anti-aliasing, visible as jagginess on curves just
    as they come off the horizontal.\r\n\r\nSide note, my opinion: Metro's so-called
    Grayscale ClearType is often preferable to GDI ClearType for font rendering at
    larger sizes, and inferior to it with most fonts at smaller body text sizes. It
    is certainly better than the old GDI Grayscale rendering. But none of these are
    as good as DirectWrite ClearType, especially at small sizes.\r\n"
