  from you. I have been working in the industry for a while as a packaging designer.
  \r\n\r\nMy co-worker and I are stumped as the official name for this symbol and
  what typefaces carry this. It has been identified as the \"euro\" but that is for
  currency. This is often used in weight claims in beauty / body products. Anyone
  can help with this one?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nC"

  body: You may find it interesting that both the Euro symbol and the Estimated sign
    were not to be tampered with, but to have precise forms in all use. This was then
    immediately ignored by type designers in the case of the Euro. Tradition has normally
    had currency symbols styled to match the faces they are a part of.

    invented... let's hope it is also allowed to evolve!

    symbol in all Adobe's (alphabetic) fonts. Some of these fonts even carry \"alternates\"
    of it, like the small cap variation in Minion Pro, and the alternate form in Garamond
    Premier Pro. These were just made to harmonize better, but such variations are
    uncommon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/estimated_3740.png]"
