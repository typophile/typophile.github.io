  on my website - someone has suggested that rather than doing this I should sell
  my fonts through eBay via a link on the website.\r\n\r\nI hadn't thought of this
  option and I'm not really sure whether I think it's a good idea.  Any opinions or
  thoughts on this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRr"

    is just a horrible idea. Any dispute resolutions will go through Paypal, which
    is incredibly unprofessional. And any time someone makes a large purchase Paypal
    will lock down your account balance for thirty days with no method for appeal.
    \r\n\r\nJust use Shopify & Fetch or Big Cartel & Pulley."

    the massive pool of fonts at MyFonts all traffic is relatively low, and this will
    only get worse after the Mono/Lino/ITC font collections are merged back in."

  body: "Yes I imagine\u2026\r\nbut for the moment FS makes only few fonts (4-5) to
    stand up,\r\nand the webfont licensing seems very interesting for users but not
    for designers.\r\nIn addition, I feel their \"unlimited websites\" mention is
    a bit confusing and barely no one understands its policy."

    what way?\r\n\r\n<cite>In addition, I feel their \"unlimited websites\" mention
    is a bit confusing and barely no one understands its policy.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    unlimited websites license allows designers to use a font on an unlimited number
    of web sites rather than purchasing licensing on a per-site or per-hits basis.
    How is that confusing?"

  body: "It think is confusing as is to the web site owner to buy his own license,
    not to the designer.\r\nThe designer does not really care about having any webfont
    license (excepted for his own site).\r\nOf course a client can use a webfont bought
    on Fs on all his websites, if he own more than one of them.\r\nOn FS the text
    expressly leads web designers in error and makes their clients not buying their
    own license.\r\nIt clearly penalises the type designer."
