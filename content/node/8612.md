  body: I just spent some time going through 23 pages of hand-printed fonts , and
    concluded that this is not one of the 500 or more fonts I looked at. My &#39;rule&#39;
    about hand-printed fonts, is that if you can&#39;t quickly find the exact one,
    then find something close and use that. <BR> <BR>The reason for that &#39;rule&#39;
    is that these kinds of fonts can be made for as cheap as FREE, and anyone who
    can print can have one made, so the odds that this designer used a font you can
    find &#40;even if it is available anywhere&#41; is extremely small and usually
    not worth the effort. <BR> <BR>The closest fonts as far as stroke, did not match
    the letterforms, but I don&#39;t know what there is about this font &#40;it IS
    a font, because the &#39;n&#39;&#39;s are identical&#41; that you particularly
    like, but if you look through <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> &#40;Everyday Hand Printing&#41;,
    you might find something that has the same quality you like about this font.  You
    could also use MyFonts and search on &#39;handwriting&#39; and get to look at
    482 fonts with many duplicates and other sorts of &#39;handwriting&#39; that are
    nothing like this style.

  body: David, I think the only thing we can hope for is that somebody  <BR>who actually
    knows this font - if it&#39;s available - stumbles onto  <BR>this post and recognises
    it, because I fear we&#39;re not going to  <BR>find it by searching for it. <BR>
    <BR>The difference in approach is baffling... THX for putting in all  <BR>this
    effort, Mike. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: To add to Mike&#39;s suggestion, you can narrow your search a bit further
    at Myfonts by typing &#34;handwriting&#34; and &#34;informal&#34; into the search.
    That gets rid of a lot of the calligraphy.

  body: Thanks everyone, Mike I especially appreciate you looking through all those
    fonts and Yves thanks again. I figured there was a slim chance but thought if
    it can be identified this was the place. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for all the help,
    <BR> <BR>David,
