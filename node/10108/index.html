		<div class="commentbody">Since reading on TV is non-immersive &#40;at least if we&#39;re talking about short captions here&#41; and the lo-res and interlacing cause of a lot of fuzz, well-spaced sans forms &#40;with a generous x-height&#41; work best I think. One of my most favorite fonts for this kind of work is Poppl-Laudatio &#40;which also has a lot of character at large sizes&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, check out Tiresias too: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/tiresias/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/tiresias/</a> <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For titles - dramas and serious programming tends to use serif, comedy and reality TV tends to use sans. Legibility doesn&#39;t seem to be a major consideration - it&#39;s about branding. <BR> <BR>Your paper might be better if you focus on captioning, subtitles and other forms of small text on TV rather than titles. screenfont.ca is a good starting point if you&#39;re after some juicy quotes.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si</div>

Unless the type is large, any typeface with fine details will get lost in both the low-res of traditional TV and the inerit blurring that is added. <BR> <BR>That said, the parents just got a new HD-wide screen TV that I spent most of my saturday afternoon wasting away in front of and I must say that type looks absolutely stunning on it.</div>

You could write a whole paper on the subject of that one font. The process by which it was created and how it became a TV standard are quite well documented. And the people involved are probably quite approachable.   <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si</div>
