  <BR>This is a typeface-sketch i worked on for some time ago. My first idea was to
  to have a fixed on every letter. But that doesn&#39;t seem to work. <BR> <BR>Any
  solutions?

  body: I think some of the letters work fine, but others are too forced. Relax the
    rules, expand the directions. <BR> <BR>BTW, don&#39;t use JPEG for type settings!
    I can see the stretch marks... GIF is king. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Per, I think the first version is a good basic. Hrant said it right, relax
    and follow the direction the font takes you in. Keep it simple. <BR>I like the
    pointy-left-under-thingy &#40;what is it called anyway?&#41;. Use it also for
    the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;b&#34;. With that you can make a really nice font. It
    will look like leafs from a tree. <BR> <BR>Keep it up. I&#39;m looking forward
    for the numerals. <BR> <BR>Ren
