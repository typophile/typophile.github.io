body: "For one of my studios this summer we have been given the freedom to propose
  our own projects, either as individuals or as small groups. For my project I considered
  a wide variety of options, including designing and sewing my own t-shirt (It would
  have been similar to the <a href=\"http://www.rapha.cc/index.php?page=489\">cycling
  inspired casual t-shirts</a> that Rapha makes.). In the end, I chose the mildly
  daunting task of designing my own, fully functional typeface. In the words of my
  classmates I'm \"crazy ambitious.\" Of course, a typeface can't be designed in one
  summer, especially considering the workload of other studios burdening my time,
  so I'm hoping to carry this into an independent study project next quarter and/or
  my thesis project. Turning it into my thesis project will depend to a certain extent
  on the theme given to us, but one of my professors has expressed a willingness to
  bend and stretch any possible theme\u2014she is pretty stoked that I am so excited
  and motivated.\r\n\r\nWhile most of my classmates came up with half-assed identity
  projects that intentionally require a minimal amount of time and effort, I'm not
  the only one to take on a fairly ambitious project. One student, inspired by a website
  dedicated to walkers world-wide is attempting to do her own version of the site,
  creating a community aspect that would be in some way tied into a user's Facebook
  profile in addition to the website she is developing. Another group of students
  are attempting to brew their own beer and are creating a brand identity and strategy
  to accompany it\u2014they're researching all sorts of really cool low-tech bottling,
  recycling, and packaging methods.\r\n\r\nA year and a half ago, we had a studio
  in which we learned to draw letters, but in the end only had to produce 9 letters
  of a serif, sans, and display (for a total 27). My intentions are to do a complete
  glyph set for bold, book, and italic weights <i>and</i> to exploit the abilities
  of OpenType as much as possible. To satisfy the proposal I submitted at the beginning
  of the summer I only have to produce the forms for 13 letters by next Friday. I've
  done so with a fair amount of ease. I've enjoyed spending my nights drawing and
  digitizing letters. Perhaps too much\u2014I've gone out and partied with my friends
  very little in exchange. But I enjoy it just as much and don't have to suffer through
  the occasional Sunday hang-over.\r\n\r\nI'll try to summon the courage in the next
  few days to show my letters here. I am in desperate need of constructive criticism\u2014my
  classmates only seem to be able to give me comments like, \"your J is cute,\" or
  \"your C kind of reminds me of Rotis.\"\u2014but am naturally a bit scared of being
  seen as the complete novice that I am."
