  studying Graphic Design. For our typography paper we have to come up with an A2
  events calendar for the Wellington City Gallery Spring Programme, 2010. \r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if I could gauge your feedback on it, I'm not entirely sure what's
  not working, but I know something isn't.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Just taking a quick glance, the first thing I'd do is get rid of the second
    horizontal rule after the dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============\r\nGRAHAM SYDNEY\r\nFREE---------\r\n\r\nGraham
    Sydney: Life & Vision\r\nMeet at the front desk / 6 pm\r\n-------------       <-this
    one isn't necessary at all and adds a lot of visual clutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the titles' sizes change (like from COLIN McCAHON to ART IN THE MORNING) which
    adds a little bit of clutter as well. They should all the the same size.\r\n\r\nThe
    type in the top left box still needs a bit of adjusting. If you're going to have
    such huge line breaks and have the horizontal rules coming across, they should
    both have the same amount of buffer room on the type (the thicker one is too close
    to the type.)\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the photo may be a bit too dark. It's hard
    to see anything there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn experiment: not sure how it will look,
    but try aligning columns 2 and 6 to the bottom. It may be effective, but also
    might look horrible. Give it a shot!\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the plus, the hierarchy is
    good, the colors look great, and everything seems to be well organized."

  body: "Hi Steve,\r\n\r\nThanks heaps for your comments, you're a legend!\r\n\r\nSo
    here are the changes as per your suggestions, it wont seem to let me upload a
    PDF, so a JPEG will have to do. Just one other thought I had - whats the general
    consensus on using hyphens in the copy?\r\n\r\nThanks again Steve - your comments
    were a big help!\r\n\r\n- M.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5811.6.jpg]"

  body: "Looking much better, well done!\r\n\r\nHyphens don't really bother me all
    that much. For me reading isn't hindered, except for two cases: when there are
    two hyphenated lines consecutively (looks bad having lots of lines end with -),
    and when a hyphenated word's other half is on a new column or new page. I always
    avoid those, as they are a bit tacky.\r\n\r\nAs for the poster: the only things
    I notice now are some of the line lengths seem a bit varied. GRAHAM SYDNEY's copy
    below it flows well, as it appears to end around the same vertical point, where
    POOR RACER's copy seems to come way too close to the next column. Maybe try dropping
    those back a little bit? The other thing I notice is instead (for columns 2 and
    6) of aligning them to the bottom, just align the dates (as in \"13 WEDNESDAY\"
    and \"17 SUNDAY\" being on the same horizontal line.) That way the last column
    won't stick out as awkwardly.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely coming together! The overall
    grid/unity has greatly increased since the last draft."
