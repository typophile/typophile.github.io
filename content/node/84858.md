body: "From 10 September until 2 October 2011, <em>Expert class Type design</em> (EcTd)
  2010&ndash;2011 students of the <em>Plantin Institute for Typography</em> will show
  their work at the famous Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MP-M_1_5351.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  applied illustrations here are coming from (in order of appearance):  Wikipedia
  (user: Manfreeed [no typo]), FEB, Ann Bessemans (2x), Stijn Cremers, and Henrik
  Kubel.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Affiche_5149.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe EcTd
  course also takes place at the Museum Plantin-Moretus. It spans ten teaching days
  spread over roughly eight months. In between the lessons the students have to work
  at home on their projects. As one can read at the <a href=\"http://www.plantingenootschap.be/?page_id=3102&lang=en:
  \">website of the Plantin Society</a>:\r\n\u2018<em>The Expert class Type Design
  given by the Plantin Institute of Typography examines the \u201Csecrets\u201D of
  con\xADtem\xADpo\xADrary repre\xADsen\xADta\xADti\xADons of the Latin script (capi\xADtal,
  roman and cur\xADsive) in detail. The under\xADly\xADing har\xADmo\xADnic, pro\xADpor\xADti\xADo\xADnal
  and rhyth\xADmic struc\xADtu\xADres of cha\xADrac\xADters and the typo\xADgra\xADphi\xADcal
  con\xADven\xADti\xADons and rules deri\xADved from them are ana\xADly\xADzed and
  dis\xADsec\xADted.</em>\u2019\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bessemans_2_4963.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  type designs may be shaped in Antwerp, not all students come from Belgium though
  (although the majority does). Some students come from the Netherlands, and there
  was one Danish, and one English student this year. Their backgrounds differ from
  bachelor to master educations in the graphic &#xFB01;eld. Some of the students were
  experienced in type design already and used the course to re&#xFB01;ne their skills
  and to enhance their insight. Another one used the course to make a thorough start
  with a typeface, which is part of a PhD research at Leiden University. Some of the
  students are lecturing themselves at graphic courses. Above all, all students share
  a deeply rooted passion for type. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bessemans_1_3939.jpg]\r\n\r\nAt
  the end eight students decided to take part in forenamed exhibition (participating
  is quite demanding). Of course, it is a unique opportunity to exhibit one\u2019s
  work at the Museum Plantin-Moretus. Normally one has to be <em>stone dead for ages</em>
  to be allowed to present work at this sacred place for typography. So, the students
  work will be shown in the same building as where one can &#xFB01;nd the &#xFB01;nest
  work of <em>Gutenberg</em>, <em>Griffo</em> and <em>Garamont</em>. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cremers_1_6011.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  will not state here that the Belgian students\u2019 work is the &#xFB01;rst milestone
  in Belgian type design since the contributions by <em>Van den Keere</em> and <em>Rosart</em>,
  but it is at least a signi&#xFB01;cant one. I include here the <a href=\"http://www.typefaces.nl/Temporary/Downloads/PG2011/Uitnodiging_PG_EcTd_2011.pdf\">link
  to the invitation</a> (PDF).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kubel_1_6084.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  for those who are interested, the EcTd course for 2011&ndash;2012 starts on 16 November
  2011.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

  body: "As mentioned, participating in the exhibition <em>De magie van het letterontwerpen
    | Van schets tot digitale letter (The magic of type design | From sketch to digital
    type)</em> is quite demanding and not every graduating student is taking part.
    The students who exhibit are (in alphabetical order):\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Ann
    Bessemans\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Stijn Cremers\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Henrik Kubel\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Peter
    Van Lancker\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Jan Neyens\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Mario Schellingerhout\r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Anne
    Verlent \r\n&#x95;&nbsp;Jeroen Visser\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EcTd_students_1_3477.jpg]\r\nDuring
    the course the students investigated the nature and origin of typographic conventions.
    Partly they did this empirically in the best tradition of Edward Johnston and
    Gerrit Noordzij, i.e. with pen and ink, as one can see on the photo above. Furthermore
    they explored to which extent writing was responsible for the shaping of movable
    type and which other factors played a role. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nThere is no discussion
    possible about the fact that written letters were initially standardized and eventually
    formalized by the Renaissance invention of movable type.\r\nFor instance Edward
    Johnston wrote on this subject: \u2018<em>The &#64257;rst printers\u2019 types
    were naturally and inevitably the more formalized, or materialized, letter of
    the writer</em>\u2019 (Edward Johnston [Heather Child ed.], <em>Formal Penmanship
    and other papers</em> [London, 1971] p.43). \r\nThat being said, it is the question
    to which extent the effects of writing should\r\nbe (re-)applied or preserved
    by present-day type designers in a profession that was shaped not by calligraphers,
    but by craftsmen. For instance Nicolas Jenson was an engraver from origin and
    Francesco Griffo was a goldsmith, as were Claude Garamont and Christoffel van
    Dijck. Type was developed mostly independently from writing since the &#64257;rst
    formalization of letterforms, and the ideas about the sense of re-using writing
    as a basis for contemporary type design clearly differ. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nIn a reaction
    on an article on type classi&#64257;cation by Gerrit Noordzij in <em>The Journal
    of Typographic Research</em> (Summer 1970), Walter Tracy states: \u2018<em>The
    fact that the prehistory of type design is to be found in handwriting is interesting
    but of little value in the practical affairs of typography and printing today</em>\u2019
    (Walter Tracy, \u2018Type Design Classi&#64257;cation\u2019, <em>Visible Language</em>,
    Volume V, Number 1, [1971] pp.59&ndash;66 [p.59]).\r\nSo, I discussed with the
    students the different theories and opinions on this subject, including my <em>model-doctrine</em>
    (see the illustration below).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Model-doctrine_4895.jpg]\r\nIn
    my opinion basically the grapheme systems in use are quite arbitrary. As soon
    as a grapheme system is set up, the further development (evolution) and consequently
    the related conditioning is de&#64257;ned by the applied structures themselves,
    and what is considered to be optically correct is only purely relative to (the
    conventions of) the models (it is unlikely that Jenson and Griffo did any legibility
    research before they developed their archetypes).\r\nConditioning is based on
    conventions and conditioning preserves conventions or even enhances them. Thus
    the snake bites its own tail; to be able to use one\u2019s \u2018eye\u2019 like
    for instance Fournier advocated in his <em>Manuel typographique</em> (1764&ndash;1766),
    one has to be educated to look at type in the same way. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n<em>Come
    and see the students\u2019 work in Antwerp!</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB\r\n\r\n"

  body: "From 17 May till 31 August 2014 projects of the <em>Expert class Type design</em>
    (EcTd) students will be exhibited at the Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp. The
    EcTd course is offered by the Plantin Institute of Typography, which operates
    under the umbrella of the renown Plantin Society. The exhibition comprises work
    of students who successfully \uFB01nished the 2012\u20132013 course and a preview
    of the ongoing projects of the current 2013\u20132014 course. This is the third
    consecutive EcTd exhibition at the Museum Plantin-Moretus and the \uFB01rst one
    that is combined with the <em>Expert class Book design</em> course.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geraert-revival_1_4644.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    displayed projects are as diverse as the students, of which many have \uFB01nished
    (multiple) bachelor or master studies in graphic design or in related subjects,
    and who all share a fascination for type (design) and typography. The subjects
    vary from an in-depth study of a renaissance typeface produced by Geraert van
    der Leye (latinised into Gerardus de Lisa when he moved to Italy) in the \uFB01fteenth
    century, resulting in a revival that clearly deviates from the \u2018Jenson-Griffo\u2019
    ones, to the development of a completely new present-day typeface. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New_type_1_5513.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    between a revival is made based on punches, matrices and type of Robert Granjon
    in the collection of the Musem Plantin-Moretus, a technically and aesthetically
    impressive line-for-line redrawing of one of the cursive \u2018hands\u2019 of
    Jan van den Velde, a Dutch master-calligrapher from the seventeenth century, and
    typefaces based on writing with the broad-nibbed pen and \uFB02exible pointed
    pen are developed for for instance display purposes or for application in children
    books.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Granjon-revival_1_6111.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    EcTd course is a tough one, if only because the students have to combine the study
    with their daily work, which varies from graphic designing to lecturing. To investigate
    historic material, to explore the in\uFB02uence of writing tools on the shape,
    contrast and contrast-\uFB02ow, to draw type based on the outcomes of the research
    and to test different font tools cost a lot of time and effort. The quality displayed
    at the exhibition is therefore even more impressive.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VandenVelde_1_4507.jpg]\r\n\r\nHaving
    the EcTd course under the roof of what can be considered the \u2018Holy Temple
    of type\u2019, i.e., the Museum Plantin-Moretus, provides not only the best possible
    atmosphere but also the very unique opportunity to make direct use of the museum\u2019s
    exquisite collection of punches, matrices, cast type and prints for research purposes
    and revival projects. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EcTd_poster_6485.jpg]"
