    head: a mix of Bodoni and Eurostyle - yes! That&#39;s it - the next great font

    different for each of us, but practically speaking to me it&#39;s a way to measure
    &#40;albeit informally&#41; the viability of physically spending time doing type
    design &#40;which does not include lettering, logo design, oriental calligraphy,
    etc.&#41; This necessarily means we can&#39;t factor in what &#34;making a living&#34;
    really means; each of us would have to skew the &#34;results&#34; of this list
    based on his/her own lifestyle/circumstances. Once we have a good &#40;never perfect&#41;
    list, each of us can look at it and say, for example: &#34;From what I know, about
    half of those 20 people seem to live too modestly for my tastes, so for me the
    list is actually around 10&#34;. No absolute list is going to work for everybody:
    so it has to be inclusive, but not imprecise. <BR> <BR>The only way I see that
    this thread can have any real value is if the list is defined somewhat narrowly,
    by simplifying the parameters: so I think the list should contain the names of
    individuals who currently earn enough money directly from their own personal time
    spent designing type to substancially sustain a lifestyle they consider satisfying.
    It doesn&#39;t have to be 100% of their income, but it does have to be enough
    on its own to maintain the person in a relatively happy state. Yes, this is all
    subjective, but that can&#39;t be avoided, and picture this thread if we tried
    to factor in more parameters... <BR> <BR>If there is a better way to make this
    thread &#42;productive&#42;, please explain. If not, that list of 52 for example
    holds no water at all, I&#39;m sorry to say. There are people on it who no longer
    design type, a person I know for a fact has had to start working as a waiter because
    he couldn&#39;t make a living in type design, a person who has released for sale
    a single -and unpopular- font in his entire &#34;career&#34;, and a bunch of others
    who aren&#39;t even close to making any such list. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s agree what

    of fonts. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a really major feature of many people&#39;s

    than a few bills through my type work. I&#39;ve never flown on Concorde, but I&#39;ve
    been to the US and Canada 6 or 7 times in the past five years, all over Europe
    and even as far as New Zealand. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say that the type business supports
    around 3-400 people world wide on a full time basis, excluding those working in
    retail sales which probably comes to around another couple of hundred. <BR> <BR>The
    3-400 is probably comprised of 600 or so actual bodies who drift in and out over
    time or as they are completing other projects. Most of those I know and have contact

    parameter. I always understood the definition to be someone whose main income
    was from font design. We already went over this, though. Side work does not invalidate
    a candidate, but it does factor into the hypothetical question of if you took
    that away from them, would they soon become bankrupt on font design income alone. '

    of free time in year. Is that better? Any parent would say No. Someone obsessed
    with a career may put off a family or love interest because they have goals to
    fulfill, or even type libraries to build. These are choices that individuals make
    every day. But the two don&#39;t have to be mutually exclusive. You just have
    to strike a balance. You are not working on your typefaces when you are teaching
    your kids about volcanos or answering questions like, &#39;Why can&#39;t humans
    live on Jupiter?&#39;  When you have kids, the best time to work on type is after
    the kids go to bed. <BR> <BR>2. Just an outsider&#39;s evaluation: There is money
    in the field, but only for those who can consistently apply themselves to the
    craft and learn HOW to make money. Everybody knows it&#39;s long hours hunched
    over a computer moving around anchor points. The people who have a career in type
    &#40;some of them on the Typophile 50&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    is better known for their magazine or their fonts? The fact of the matter, I think,
    is that there are tons of good type designers out there and we should simply know
    about them and learn from them, not discuss if they are/are not full time, bona
    fide type designers. Its kinda silly and a real wanking waste of time.  <BR>And
    just for the sake of going on to the name dropping band wagon, here are a few
    names: <BR> <BR>- Chester &#40;definitely a type designer making a living out

    a contentious or ludicrous route I&#39;m not <BR>sure it&#39;s a wanking waste

    <BR>I think the main point is that regardless of  <BR>training and talent it may

  body: ' ...and some more clarification from me. it&#39;s actually quite frightening
    how most of the people participating in this thread have no idea what they&#39;re
    talking about. And we haven&#39;t heard much from actual typedesigners on those
    lists, apart from jonathan. <BR> <BR>First: <BR>let&#39;s distinguish between
    getting paid for designing a typeface, like a corporate font for a one-off fee,
    then the residual income from royalties, and finally income from retail sales
    of libraries.  <BR> <BR>In the case of emigre, for example, zuzanna licko earns
    royalties from the sales of her fonts as do other designer who have designs with
    that foundry -- eg john downer et al. Zuzanna also makes money from the retail
    business as she is one of the owners of the company. <BR> <BR>Another example:
    Roger Black. While Roger has never designed a typeface in his life &#40;how did
    he ever make that list?&#41;, he is still a partner in FontBureau who make their
    money from both selling retail type and designing special commissions. So Roger
    makes money from type, but isn&#39;t a type designer.  <BR> <BR>And a last one:
    Erik Spiekermann. The residuals of my fonts -- FF Meta, FF Info, ITC Officina,
    even the fonts I did for Berthold 25 years ago, but not from Harvey Hunt who doesn&#39;t
    pay designers -- could provide a handsome living if I didn&#39;t spend so much
    money on international flights and if I could be sure those fonts would sell forever.
    I also design typefaces on an exclusive basis for a one-off fee. Recently that
    was the case for Nokia, where I just did some rough digital concepts and Monotype
    did the rest. Then, as a partner in FontShop International, I would receive an
    income it we didn&#39;t spend all the money on fighting Harvey Hunt&#39;s legal
    cases against us and our designers. Until 2 years ago, I was a partner in MetaDesign
    and designed typefaces for clients of that company, helped by -- amonst others
    -- our resident typedesigners like Lucas de Groot, Ole Sch&auml;fer, Albert Pingerra,
    Erik van BLokland, Just van Rossum et al, who all got paid a wage but no license
    fees for the fonts MetaDesign did for our clients like Volkswagen, Audi, Heidelberg
    etc. <BR> <BR>FontFont designers get 20% of retail, and most other foundries pay
    similar fees. If you have bestseller, you can make a few thousand dollars a month.
    There are, however, not many bestsellers out there that sell over a long period
    of time. And designers like Adrian Frutiger have old contracts with Linotype paying
    much less than 20%.  In fact, if Adrian was on 20%, he&#39;d be a millionaire.
    Unfortunately, a few foundries sold their libraries to distributors for a one-off
    fee &#40;like ITC did to Linotype afew years ago&#41;, so the designes got a few
    dollars once, but now only the distibutor earns. If you buy ITC Officina from
    Linotype, I don&#39;t get a penny, but if you buy it from Agfa, I get 20%. <BR>
    <BR>Out of the dozens of typedesigners who have their work represented by FontShop
    International, only a dozen or so could have lived off their royalties, at least
    for a while. <BR> <BR>The confusion stems mainly from the fact that design and
    production have merged, and in some cases the designers and producers are also
    the retailers. Gerard Unger has a few faces with other libraries but also sells
    some of them from his home as a one-man foundry. He still designs for commissions
    &#40;like the Dutch Highway Authority&#41; and also works as a freelance graphic
    designer. <BR> <BR>So strangely, while all the typedesigners I know also do other
    work, there are some people who make a living entirely from selling fonts: all
    those who work for a foundry. And Clive is totall right with his estimate of maybe
    600 people making a living out of font sales worldwide. Clive is totally wrong
    with giving me credit as a designer and not as a typedesigner. These days, it&#39;s
    the other way round. '

  body: ' Erik! Thanks so much for your clarifications. In defence of my own ignorance
    on the subject of earning a living as a type designer; it was never through want
    of asking. When I was designing type nobody ever gave me any idea how much I might
    make off any royalty agreement I might sign except for those who offered an up
    front advance on royalties. &#40;Is it only ITC that still does this?&#41; Frankly,
    from almost every design company that ever bothered to respond to my questions
    about type design - the technicalities of production and the business side - I
    got what ammounted to snide amusement at my lack of knowledge, as if I was simply
    not in the club and never going to get in either. &#40;Evidently they were right.&#41;
    I&#39;m not complaining about the whole self-educated aspect of type design which
    seems to be the common denominator amongst designers, great and small. And I don&#39;t
    wish to sound like I&#39;m whining about a lack of commercial success. But until
    the internet came along and people began to share information on the technicalities,
    at least, type design was for me, work in a dark vaccuum, where no sound or light
    seemed to enter or leave. It was a mystery to me how font companies ever got any
    new designs, because the last thing they seemed to be doing was giving the eager
    designer any helpful advice.  <BR> <BR>On the subject of actual dollar amounts
    earned: I&#39;m not about to ask a designer to show me their bank statements,
    but can&#39;t someone, somewhere show us some figures? E.g. how many units of
    a bestseller were sold over a certain period of time; and perhaps for comparison
    the figures on a very average-selling font. '
