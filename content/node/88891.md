  type faces. In some situations, repeating symbols in an organic font should not
  look exactly the same but slightly different. Are there type faces with multiple
  glyphs per symbol? Or with generative means to vary glyphs? What is the technical
  name for such type faces? Can you name examples?\r\n\r\nThanks so much! --Tom"

    in a random manner every time a glyph was drawn?
