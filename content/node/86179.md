  body: In both cases, what you see are probably simply effects added to existing
    typefaces. Unfortunately, these effects obfuscate a lot of the detail which would
    otherwise be helpful for making an identification. Nonetheless, LOOSE could simply
    be Futura Bold or something similar to it. As far as the second sample goes, I
    haven't a clue because the sample doesn't provide one.
