body: "Hello Everybody,\r\n\r\nI thought I'd share another thing I'm working on with
  you. I started this a while ago for a rather big client who gave me a VERY specific
  and limiting briefing, which is why this typeface deliberatly borrows elements of
  Helvetica, DIN and Eurostile (!!). This is nothing I'd normally do, but I tried
  to have fun with it and somehow find a way to make this worthwhile, and in the end
  I really started to like this.\r\n\r\nWhen the job finally didn't happen, I stopped
  working on this, but now I have a client who wants to use this , so I have to finish
  at least the light style. \r\n\r\nAny comments are highly appreciated...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n*H\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bruna_01_4941.jpg]"

  body: "I think it works well, apart from the lowercase a. It looks too much forced
    into the grid, in my opinion. Especially apparent in the heavier weights (in the
    light version it isn't really that bad).\r\n\r\nPersonally I like the Eurostile
    influence, to be honest. Maybe it prevents it from becoming just another grotesk.\r\n\r\nAnd
    on a sidenote, really a coincidence; I used a very similar text for a specimen
    I made a while ago. With electromagnetic oscillating thermoplastic generators,
    etc. ;)"

    where it's going, but it DOES feel a little forced. To be honest, the only style
    I really worked on, is the Light (because that one was initially required), the
    rest was quickly done in one afternoon. Anyway, I'll try to refine it...\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone think the S is too wide? I've just looked at it too often, I guess...\r\n\r\n*H"

    To be honest, do we need another grot that looks the same as the rest? Yours has
    a more industrial feel to it that I think works well.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm a sucker
    for light weights :)"

  body: "This is going to be a great typeface! I think the lc a of the light works
    perfectly fine, perhaps it needs a little thinning towards the terminal, but I
    agree that the bold a needs more work. \r\n\r\nI think the n, m and h shoulders
    perhaps need a little attention, I would have tried opening them a little bit
    more, perhaps by moving the center of the curve just a tiny bit to the right.
    \r\n\r\nHave you considered alternative ways of joining the k and K arms to their
    stems? Your solution works great, though.  \r\n\r\nI think the S is as wide as
    it should be, but I'd have another a look at the curves, I think there is some
    very slight disharmony between the upper and lower part of the glyph.\r\n\r\nTo
    these Norwegian eyes, the \xC5 with the ring joined to the A looks weird. I know
    a lot of typefaces do this, but to us Scandinavians, it's just wrong. Also, the
    eth doesn't work. (I read Old Norse, so I am very used to eths, thorns and o with
    ogoneks.) Have a look at [[http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/2.1.4.eth.htm|Gunnlaugur
    Briem's advice]]. \r\n\r\nPlease take these suggestion with several grains of
    salt, I'm a beginner at typedrawing. \r\n\r\nI have to say I'm quite envious of
    this typeface, I've tried something similar myself, but yours is way better. Drawing
    a good sans is far more difficult than drawing a serif, in my opinion. I'm really
    looking forward to seeing it developed. "

  body: "That's a very interesting one! You can imagine a type geek looking at this
    in a paragraph thinking that it's Eurostile from it's look and feel and then checking
    the individual letterforms and going: What the hell?!\r\n\r\nThe text setting
    is very convincing on paper. Maybe I was looking too close but the \"f\" and the
    \"t\" seemed to be a little too close to the letters preceding them and a little
    far from the letters following them.\r\nThe notch on the \"r\" might be a tiny
    bit longer, it doesn't bother when reading but I don't know thought I'd mention
    that. In the bold version it would be awesome to have contextual alternates for
    the \"r\" where the notch is straight (like it is now) before an \"f\" or a \"t\"
    and then maybe a little curved down before round letters and maybe a little wider
    (longer notch) before straight letters.\r\nI don't know just thinking."

    make the a like in DIN. The tail of the g needs more curve imo.\r\nAlso the horizontal
