  body: "Looks very close to [[http://www.dafont.com/xscale.font?nb_ppp=50&text=CUP+SERIES|Xscale]]
    freebie techno font with obliquing. A very small tweak to the R and it's identical,
    I think.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but this look is so stereotyped it makes me ill. Not
    your problem, I know.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    you describe this look as? (fonts like Denmark, Newstrike, Terminator 2 style
    etc)"

  body: "I usually call this style Techno, because it has simplified letterforms intended
    to look futuristic and/or high tech. My complaint is that it has become too much
    of a clich\xE9. There are actually some 'techno' fonts that show an effort to
    add style and design to the high tech look, but what seems to be used so often
    are amateur freebie fonts made up mostly of straight lines that look like most
    of the other tech-look fonts. I suspect these are popular for amateur font designers,
    because they are relatively simple to design, since curves are kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe
    site where I tend to look for more 'interesting' techno fonts is T-26, but I also
    like some of Psy/Ops fonts. That said, 'Techno' is not my favorite style, by a
    long shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
