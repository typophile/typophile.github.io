body: In my perusal of fonts at sources like Linotype.com I am coming across terms
  that I do not recognize and cannot understand. Perhaps they are part of the proper
  name of the font, or they mean something, such as a specific way of modifying a
  font. The most recent one I came across was Plantin Infant. I cannot find a decent
  explanation of what the difference is between Plantin and Plantin Infant. Two other
  terms I see attached to specific fonts are news and cyrillic. Any thoughts would
  be welcome.

  body: Thank you hrant. I think I will try to find a decent book on typestyles, to
    learn more about the terminology and art. I would be grateful to learn of any
    particuarly good titles.

  body: "Infant means the \"a\" and \"g\" are monocular (and sometimes the\r\n\"y\"
    has a \"u\" top), matching what a child would write by hand,\r\nhence presumably
    read with more ease.\r\n\r\nNews means the vertical proportions are conducive
    for setting the\r\nfont in small sizes with no (or even negative) leading and
    short line\r\nmeasures, on low-quality paper.\r\n\r\nCyrillic means it contains
    the characters supporting typesetting in\r\nthe Cyrillic alphabet, which typically
    means in the Russian language.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
