body: "Hi all,\r\nI just wanted to show my first release of 2015. Spry Roman was first
  created with lettering I did with a Zebra G pointed nib and ink on slightly toothy
  paper. I rework my lettering in Photoshop, but try to leave the look reasonably
  close to the original writing for fonts like this. Spry Roman is a fully featured
  Opentype font. It include Central European language support, a full set of small
  caps, simple fractions, ordinals, and a variety of ornaments and flourishes.\r\n\r\nCurrently
  available at:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/spry-roman/\r\nhttps://creativemarket.com/StephenRapp/146018-Spry-Roman-Pro\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spry1CM_4087.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpryRoman_Development_4986.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpryOrnaments_4516.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CM2_5671.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpryRoman5CM_3940.jpg]"
