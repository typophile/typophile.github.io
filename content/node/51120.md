  of creating a poster about and using Rudolf Koch's typeface Kabel.\r\n\r\nI looked
  around the internet for some resources however the only place I can seem to find
  any information is the general overview provided by Linotype.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could
  point me to some resources where I could find some more information about Rudolf
  Koch and the creation of Kabel I would greatly appreciate it thank you!"

    I do not need an extremely large amount of information as it is only going on
    a poster, however if there were some resources available on line it would greatly
    help getting a rough idea of the characteristics of the typeface itself."
