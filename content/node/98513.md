body: "Hi Guys, new to the board. I am in a team sports supply business, and have
  started doing logos for several different teams. Now they come in with some fonts
  that's pretty easy to figure out, but some that just gives me fits b/c I know I
  should know them. Take this one for example.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swat

  of me figure out, and What the Font has been no help whatsoever. Anyone happen to
  know what it could be? Thanks  in advance!"
