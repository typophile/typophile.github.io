  a typeface called &#40;I think&#41; Dream, which looked like hand-lettered comic
  book type, with a variety of weights. Does anyone know where I can buy it? <BR>Thanks

    etc. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.dreamerdesign.com" target="_blank">http://www.dreamerdesign.com</a>

  body: Awright, good one Sean! Tell us Robert, did he nail it? <BR> <BR>One hundred
    and fifty bucks is a pretty steep price for a  <BR>single weight of hand lettered
    comic book font methinks. :/

  body: Not only that, but they&#39;ve buried their font buying thing so deep on the
    web, probably the only people who would buy that face are folks who didn&#39;t
    know that ComicCraft does better work for cheaper.
