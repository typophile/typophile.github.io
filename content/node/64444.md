body: "I'm tying to make a small script with robafab far a multiple master Font.\r\nBasically
  my script will move a component inside a diacritic glyph.\r\n\r\nFor intance moving
  the \"acute\" accent inside \"oacute\".\r\nThis is the script:\r\n____________\r\n\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\n\r\ng = f[\"oacute\"]\r\ng.components[1].move((-100,-100))\r\n____________\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is:\r\nSince my font is a multiple master with two weight masters, when
  I run this script, it moves the accent in the both masters.\r\n\r\nIs there any
  way to move the accent only in one of the masters?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced.\r\n"

  body: "As far as I know, RoboFab is not able to deal with individual instances in
    a multiple master file. You might be able to achieve your goal by using FontLab\u2019s
    native Python implementation instead.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, why not use anchors for
    placing accents? If done correctly it will save you the hassle of dealing with
    individual accented glyphs.\r\n\r\n-Paul van der Laan\r\nwww.type-invaders.com"

    never used ancors, but I check it out and it seems great. Thanks for the sugestion,
    this was something I didn't know.\r\n"

    is possible to move component inside MM font. I made those based on typical fontlab
    scripts. Karsten Lucke have some nice MM helpers.\r\n\r\nHere comes code, dont
    forget indetation in the \"for loop\" and if/else.\r\n\r\nPS. Does someone have
    a good method how to \"append\" a component inside MM fglyph?\r\nI've tried many
