  body: "Seeing those two sources is almost like guaranteeing that neither of those
    is the original name for this typeface. I did a quick scan through the Solotype
    Catalog and didn't spot it. Mike F. would be my bet to know what this is really
    called.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Camberic looks just like the one I'm after. However, all sources I've found
    so far are corrupt and won't install. Does anyone have a clean version or source
    for it? Or, is this not the correct font as Mike Y suggests? Thanks!\r\n\r\n"
