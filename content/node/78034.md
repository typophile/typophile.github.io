  body: No OpenType features support of any kind, neither simple nor complex scripts.
    The development branch have some preliminary work to support OpenType but it may
    be a year or two before being releasable (if ever, they have been promising OpenType
    support for years now).

  body: "I'm using it as a prior design environment.\r\n\r\nSome drawbacks : no OpenType
    advanced features, tedious text handling (some improvements on the way for the
    next version for the latter problem ; same goes for color \u2014 ginger koons
    is working on it: http://www.adaptstudio.ca/blog/2010/06/a-talk-about-open-colour.html)\r\n\r\nPros:
    of course the price, multi-plateform, and open editing format\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks
    are obviously overwhelmed by the pros, as you'll see in practice ;-)"
