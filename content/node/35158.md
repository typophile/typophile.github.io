  body: "I might have to side with Patty. The 3 s's in sisters are all different,
    the e's are different and the i's are different. \r\n\r\nIf it's not manipulated
    or hand done, it looks like it might be a block print where the ink bleed or trapped
    to created thin/think line strokes. \r\n\r\nNot to mention that the baseline is
    not constant, so each letter was individually shifted up or down."
