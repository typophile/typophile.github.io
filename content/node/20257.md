  taking my first tentative steps towards working with grids and am attempting to
  locate some really unique grid layouts. Apart from the obvious, could anyone direct
  me towards their favourite uses of grids in design? The good, the bad and the ugly!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\nJez."

    out Joseph M\xFCller Brockamn's book \"Gird Systems in Graphic Design\". The bets
    of its kind imho. Also, Most all design is based on a grid, just sit down and
    look at what you like, and start drawing in some key lines around the major elements,
    and typically you will be able to decipher some sort of pattern/diagram from that.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    check out Tschichold and other similar designers, they used a very structuralist
    technique."

  body: "The Designer And The Grid\r\nby Lucienne Roberts and Julia Thrift\r\nis not
    so bad (especially if you are just starting with grid systems), \r\nbecause it
    shows some nice designs AND the grid system used for it.\r\nCheap (there is a
    paperback version available), colourful, well illustrated.\r\n\r\nTypography:
    Macro- and Microaesthetics\r\nby  Willi Kunz\r\nis a littlte bit more serious:
    Basel/Swiss style moderism,\r\nwith some essential information about typography
    and graphic composition\r\n\r\nGrid Systems in Graphic Design     \r\nby  Josef
    Muller-Brockmann\r\nis a classic, because it was one of the first descriptions
    of a grid system\r\nand it shows the connection between the modernists ideas \r\n(clear,
    simple information as a prerequisite of a democratic society)  \r\nand the grid
    systems. However, I rather see it as a historical document,\r\nless an useful
    guide how to use grids nowadays.\r\n\r\nIf you want to design with other grids
    than a modular grid system,\r\nhave a look at this book:\r\nThe Typographic Grid
    \     \r\nby  Hans Rudolf Bosshard \r\nIn this book you can find some quite interesting
    individualistic (and hence complicated) grid systems. Refreshing stuff. However,
    for a beginner it is easier to work with a modular grid system, I think. (Modular
    means the smallest units in a grid - in most cases the width of a column - are
    equal in size.)\r\n\r\nGrid Systems: Principles of Organizing Type\r\nby Kimberly
    Elam\r\nis a cheap book, but it is even cheaper to buy it not\r\n\r\n\r\n>  The
    way to develop the most unique grids would be to create your own\r\nI do not understand
    - you ALWAYS create your own grid. If you use a grid system that was designed
    for a different purpose and fill it with your content the result can only be miserable.
    You can check existing grids as a role model, but you always create the grid from
    the inside, from the characteristics of the main body text (leading and column
    width of the main body text), and probably also from the proportions of the pictures
    you want to use. From the leading of the main text you get the baseline grid.
    From the length of the text columns and the width of the picture you get an idea
    how many columns might be useful. Too few horizontal units - say 4 columns only
    - , and the layout will be stiff, too many, and the system will become too confusing
    for you. A tip: 12 columns are not a bad idea, cause you can divide it by 2,3
    and 4 (and 6, if you need it) - but of course it always depends on the nature
    of the material (texts, pictures) what is appropriate.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot
    of designers who are doing great stuff and don't have any idea what a grid is.
    But if you have to deal with complicated layouts, grid systems are necessary.
    \r\n(Also when you need to specify design systems for other people.) Probably
    you can compare it with music: As long as you play together with just a few other
    guys, you don't need to know about composition techniques - your ear will be more
    important. There are a lot of great musicians and song writers who do not know
    how to read musical notation. But if you want to write music for big orchestras,
    you'll have to learn composition techniques. "
