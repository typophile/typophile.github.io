  body: David, I think the reason you have seen it before is that the style is a very
    easy one to imitate. There must be at least 4 or 5 of these in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 5 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>.  If you give me a few
    minutes I may be able to pinpoint which one this is, or at least give you some
    similar alternatives.

  body: 'Well, I&#39;ve looked through all 38 pages of Part 5, and this isn&#39;t
    one of the eight &#39;blob serif&#39; fonts I had already collected.  If you want
    to look them up, they are: Sheryl &#40;p.1&#41;, Sorority Hack &#40;p. 8&#41;,
    Telegram &#40;p.9&#41;, Argetab Obbed &#40;p.9&#41;, Chubble &#40;p.21&#41;, Cool
    Dots &#40;p.24&#41;, Joker Wild &#40;p.26&#41; and Bill&#39;s Holiday &#40;p.29&#41;.
    There is also Adelita from Type-O-Tones, which I do not have a sample for &#40;yet&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Your font looks like it was done by someone with a better than average
    flair for lettering, so it&#39;s possible it&#39;s a commercial font, or at least
    the work of a professional. There are several scrapbooking sites that include
    fonts mostly done by amateurs, and this style is often seen. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/telegram/telegram/testdrive.html?s=Scrappin+Fabulous&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">&#39;Telegram&#39;</a> by Timothy Donaldson, which would need
    to be darkened, or Robert Schenk&#39;s  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/argentab-obbed/bold/testdrive.html?s=Scrappin+Fabulous&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Argetab Obbed</a> might be good alternatives among commercial
    fonts. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps.'

    Schenk&#39;s font. It&#39;s &#39;Argentab Obbed&#39;.

    card-making program &#40;long ago&#41;, <BR>so I don&#39;t know which, if any,
    of the current versions make it avail- <BR>able. There&#39;s a bold variant as
    well. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68371.gif"

  body: Mike, If you have that font, is there any chance of getting you to make a
    sample of that for the Script Font ID Guide? Let me know if you want a sample
    template. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: I&#39;d be happy to, Mike. I&#39;ve got to take off now, though, so it&#39;ll
    have to wait until tomorrow. <BR> <BR>In the meantime, do you have any of the
    Hallmark script fonts in your guide? If not, I&#39;ll put together a sample of
    each to send you and you can pick and choose. Some are rather nice and/or unique
    and others are humdrum everyday hand scripts.

  body: Thanks Mike, that&#39;s very good of you to offer to do this and the other
    Hallmark fonts. I do not have more than one or two of them,  so it would be great
    to get what you have. You can use the e-mail address on my site, or use the typophile
    address, whenever you have time to do them. <BR> <BR>I appreciate your help for
    the Guide very much.
