  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Typophilers, <BR> <BR>I would be interested in design stuff that&#39;s made in your town, whereever you are outthere in the world.  <BR>I&#39;m living in Maastricht &#40;Holland&#41; and D&uuml;sseldorf &#40;Germany&#41; and we have some interesting stuff going on in graphic design. We could exchange flyers, brochures, photo&#39;s, typothings, and so on, if you would be interested. In that way you get to know what we do here, and I what you do over there. It doesn&#39;t have to be made by you. You could robb the local flyer display and anything you find on the streets and send that. I like more to have printed work than to see that on an internet site. The paper adds another dimension to the work.  <BR> <BR>Are there people who would be interested in something like that? <BR>I find that living out here can very fast become limited if you don&#39;t open your eyes and start to look around. In the old days people travelled all over the world and robbed countries of there national treasures to enhance there own. We could do the same on a friendly base.  <BR> <BR>If you would be interested, please reply, and we could get exchanging neat stuff.  <BR>I can&#39;t send the same stuff to everyone &#40;mail is expensive&#41; but a lot is possible.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi robbers, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m back. I had a really hard few days with at work. <BR> <BR>&#62; sounds interesting. hey, if you dutch would quit making such pretty stamps maybe mailing stuff wouldn&#39;t be so expensive ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Isaac. We are good, aren&#39;t we. We have a rep to keep up. <BR> <BR>&#62; If more people take part, won&#39;t you end up like sending out 10 sets of everything?  <BR> <BR>Karen. I think Kenn likes to have the real deal. He would like to have the piece I&#39;ve found in the streets, smell, taste and everything included. I can&#39;t send everything to everyone. I&#39;ll do what I can on a personal base. I&#39;ll look especially around for one person.  <BR> <BR>&#62; You could set it up this way. The first person, e.g.  <BR> <BR>John. Not a bad idea. If someone would be interested in something like this we could try it out. This only goes with thing you can get for free or buy. Things I find in the streets go to Kenn. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; Does it need to be designed locally?  <BR> <BR>Karen. Not neccesarily. I like everything out of the ordinary. If you find something Russian in Tokyo, it&#39;s also OK. <BR> <BR>Kenn. I&#39;ve found some things for you on the streets. I&#39;ll have to get a feeling for what you like, so please give me some feedback on the stuff I send you.  <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>Ren</div>
