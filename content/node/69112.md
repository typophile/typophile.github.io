body: "I've been working on a custom script font for someone that needed a lot of
  ligatures many of which are contextual. Everything seems to work fine in FontLab
  Studio, but when I generated it in OT- PS flavor I ran into some unexplainable problems.
  In both InDesign and Illustrator CS3 some of the ligatures and contextual versions
  of them were unavailable. They showed up as black glyph cells in the glyph palette
  and even had the little submenu arrows where they should. When I hovered over the
  cells it would show the index numbers and such that seemed to match the font as
  well.\r\n\r\nI checked the feature code and its exactly the same as other similar
  ligatures. In the OT window I have the clig feature followed by the liga feature.
  So, for example, the liga feature for the basic connecting version of p_y is set
  up as \"sub p' y' by p_y;\" Almost all the ligatures ending in y have a regular
  ligature, an ending ligature version under clig, and some flourished versions in
  stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of the same code for both the p_y ending
  and another similar:\r\n\r\nlookup clig_by.end {\r\nignore sub b' y' @Letter;\r\nsub
  b' y' space by b_y.end;\r\n} clig_by.end;\r\n\r\nlookup clig_py.end {\r\nignore
  sub p' y' @Letter;\r\nsub p' y' space by p_y.end;\r\n} clig_py.end;\r\n\r\nIt works
  fine for the b_y, but in InDesign I get empty glyph cells for all the ligatures
  of a_y, and all but the last ones of h_y and p_y. Also\u2026 in Font Explore it
  seemed fine until I typed in one of the troubled ligatures in the preview. The suddenly
  Font Explorer popped up a warning that I had a corrupt font and should delete it
  immediately. I regenerated right before leaving for work this morning and switched
  it to a OT truetype version and now it seems to work flawlessly. I did get asked
  when generating it if I would like to generate it in Names mode instead of unicode
  since less than 30% of the glyphs were unicode characters. So I chose Names mode.\r\n\r\nHere

  body: "Mark, I'm using Font Explorer and I cleaned both the regular cache and Adobe
    caches from it. I even restarted after that once, but it still did it.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9,
    by \"relocate the startpoints\" do you mean just change the points of the outline
    so it has a new start point?"

    that was the solution. I'd forgotten about it until he suggested it."

  body: "Yes, that's what I meant -- I think the problem relates to the autohinting
    in FontLab since I've always found that removing hinting will also solve the problem.
    Just changing the order of points seems to solve whatever hiccup FLS is having.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
