  what this is? Looks like some sort of a very compressed Akzidenz to me.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n/A"

  body: Yeah I'd say your right. The seven looks spot on. It's a version of Akzidenz
    with the straight leg on the 'R'. Do you have a higher res scan than this and
    I could give you a more conclusive ID.

    comes close but it not it! The <em>G</em> and the <em>1</em> are different!

  body: "Robbiefa; Yes I tought of Steelfish too but like you say the G is diffrent.
    And you're right about the G not resembling the Akzidenz G so it can't be that.\r\n\r\nNaoiseo:
    I'm sorry I havent got  a higher res scan.\r\n\r\nI thougt this was a pretty common
    typeface but I really can't figure out what it is or even find other examples
    of it in use now that I look for it.\r\n\r\nI thought I'd seen it on old jazz
    vinyl record covers, mid century style, but I might be wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah apologies, I jumped into this thread without really looking. With a big
    giant 'G' looking me straight in the face! (no pun intended)

  body: I had never heard of the Feltron Report but you are right Steven It must be
    from that one and so the font must be Giant. Thanks for leading me in the right
    direction!

  body: "First of all, Opti made no original fonts. All were clones of others. The
    name Giant came from the original Filmotype typeface of that name. Filmotype had
    a whole slew of these Gothics with names that started with 'G' - from the thinnest,
    most condensed Galaxy Gothic to the heaviest, widest Goddess Gothic.\r\n\r\nSince
    getting any Opti font these days can be tricky, I'll mention that the old <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Brendel</a> equivalent, <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=dc.gif/Sdc02638.gif\"
    target=\"_blank\">Undertaker</a>, is available.\r\n\r\nTo my eye, though, what
    was used is one size down the ladder at Garfield Gothic. This is available digitally
    today from URW as Bee 3. The <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bee/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Bee fonts</a> take their names from the VGC equivalents of the
    Filmotype faces. VGC creatively named those B-1, B-2, etc. The only problem with
    the URW fonts is that they don't include any of the alternates, like that straight-legged
    'R' that were available in the Filmotype originals."

    I know, because I shelled out $7 for the ink-on-paper version -- signed, and everything!\r\n\r\n"
