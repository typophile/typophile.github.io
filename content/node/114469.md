    of the current, \u2018new\u2019 one? (It even isn\u2019t <cite>that</cite> new
    any more, having been launched in 2009.) I think the new site offers a number
    of useful features that the old one is missing: You can, for instance, directly
    link to an <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-Z6XniA\">overview page</a> with your
    own sample text, there is a better <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sprint/sprint/glyphs/533079/51\">close-up
    view</a> of characters, you have much more sophisticated options for advanced
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/\">searching</a>\u2014just saying&nbsp;\u2026"
