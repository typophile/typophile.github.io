  body: "\"tagline goes here\": [[http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Dancing+Script|Dancing
    Script]]\r\nDon't know the one for \"Your Blog Title Here\". That said, this banner
    looks like to be a printscreen of an online web template. These 2 texts are most
    probably set using (free) webfonts. It could be very easy to know the missing
    one , simply having a look to css/code (and even easier using [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm|WhatFont
    Chrome app]]).\r\n\r\nEDIT: finally got it. [[http://www.dafont.com/-skinny-jeans.font|Skinny
