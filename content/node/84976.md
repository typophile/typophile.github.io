  body: "<cite>Does this still hold true for Postscript fonts?</cite>\r\n\r\nDepends
    on what you mean by \u201CPostScript fonts\u201D. It is certainly not true for
    PostScript-flavoured OpenType fonts. (usually .oft)"

  body: "I meant traditional Postscript fonts (not Opentype). The quote says \"In
    the past\" and I'm wondering if they are referring Postscript fonts beginnings
    or the last versions we've seen or have they always contained just 256 glyphs
    and been broken in different files to create the MM fonts? I wanted to verify
    the information to make a comparison of Postscript vs. Opentype for my students.
    Then again, I bet no one works with Postscripts anymore. \r\n\r\nWe just happen
    to have plenty of Postscript fonts and very few Opentype and I would like them
    to see what they would gain by working with Opentype."

  body: "Maybe one of the Adobe guys can explain it in more detail, but I believe
    you could theoretically put more than 256 glyphs in a Type1 font, but since the
    \"typical Western encodings\u201C were based on 8 bit, those additional glyphs
    would not be accessible to apps (like Freehand) expecting those 8 bit encodings.
    So especially Western fonts only used 256 glyphs until the format died. \r\n\r\nAnd
    just for the record: If you want to compare Type1 to OpenType, don't forget that
    most of the credit should go to the TrueType format:\r\nhttp://opentype.info/blog/2010/07/31/opentype-myths-explained/\r\n"

  body: "Ralf, I agree. It's not even theoretical, there used to be fonts with lots
    of glyphs. (But don't ask me which ones it were :P )\r\n\r\nThe encoding system
    prohibited access to only 256 at a time, but smartly written software could get
    past that limit by creating virtual copies of the fonts with different encodings."

    to install an otf font to be used with TeX, you basically generate one large Type
    1 font file containing all the glyphs of the otf font, and then one (small) [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=virtualfonts|virtual
    font]] for each set of features you want to use. "

  body: Thank you all and thank you for the ttf link. I do have to cover some ttf
    also...as it was completely omitted from theory! I think the teachers here relate
    ttf to PCs or dafont and wish it just didn't exist or something ;-)

    one would use a utility to generate subsets. Any one else remember that?
