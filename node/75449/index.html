  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello people, how are we?

I am working on a logo for a sportswear company I am starting up.

The company name is fourmation, I did want to use the company name formation but couldn't. I then justified calling it fourmation because of the numbers used for formations in sport etc...drill me if I need drilling haha.

First option:

I decided that because its a logo going on sportswear that in needs to be simple, effective and work in one colour only. Attached is a concept that stood out for me, the word fourmation will appear below it. I wanted the logo to refer to the number four somehow but not in a cliche way...I am sure we call all dream up something in no time using the number 4, I didn't want it to be that easy.

As you can see in the logo there is both a "f" and a "4", I need to know if this is obvious enough to work? I am worried that the 4 doesn't look convincing enough, am I right?

Second option:

I have showen this logo to a few people and they love it, out off all the concepts I have showen them they seem to go straight to this one? Does anyone else here like it? I personally are very unsure

Please help!!!

I deliberately looked at the logos first, then read your comment.

<cite>Just an idea, not really a great mockup even, but incoporates the full name in the same.</cite>

Michael; I too like the first version, but something needs to be done to ensure it doesn't feel like a swastika. Color should solve that; perhaps even just 50% gray would add a touch of class and sleek elegance. I picture it as a zipper pull and embroidered in a nice steely, silvery gray.</div>

The mark is great imo. I would be interested to see how the word "Fourmation" is position around it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">mrgraphics: I was just saying your version just doesn't work. It's inexplicably forced, totally illegible unless it's huge, and your placement of the word "fourmation" awkwardly breaks the flow and boldness of the graphic. 

But, since you asked....it is considered by many here on Typophile to be bad form to post design revisions of somebody else's design-in-progress. If the re-design you post turns out to be a great idea, it puts the commissioned designer in an untenable position: either stealing your design work, or, being forced to abandon a great idea because they <em>don't want to steal</em> another designer's work. 

It's an ethics problem, if not a question of personal integrity. So, if you have a helpful idea, it's best, IMHO, just to write your idea rather than post a revised design. Plus, writing helps develop your ability to communicate graphics verbally, and that's something invaluable when dealing with clients. </div>
