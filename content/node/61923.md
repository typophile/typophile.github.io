body: "Ok, let's try again ;) (I tried under \"blackletter\", but no luck...)\r\nMy
  name is Piotr Kocybik and I'm a graphic designer, but that's completly not important
  :). \r\n\r\nUntil yesterday I was a quiet spectator of all the wonders of this miraculous
  forum, but since certain things happened i am forced to abandon my safety zone and
  encounter some reasonable Typophiliac feedback. Please help.\r\n\r\nI am working
  on an visual identity program for 600th Battle of Grunwald aniversary (see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grunwald|wiki]]).\r\n\r\nI've
  made a decision to make a logotype and it took me to the point of creating my own
  typeface for this particular purpose. (not the whole character set, just some glyphs
  \u2013 to create a sort of graphic system).\r\n\r\nThe starting point is the number:
  \"600\".Basic idea is that \"6\" refers to \"G\", as in \"Grunwald\". Help appreciated.
  \u2013 i need to pick a face for the caption to accompany the \"600\". \"Beedicta\"
  by Elias Bitencourt could be nice but it's not ready as far as i know. \r\n\r\nThen
  comes the full name \"Grunwald\" \u2013 as an alterative to the \"600\" \u2013 i.e.
  without the caption. \r\n\r\nLatter files contain other texts set using some extra
  characters constructed in the same manner as the firs \u2013 \"600 lat\", meaning
  \"600 years\" and the name \"google\" (maybe for the anniversary day?). There's
  also the thing in use.\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask what do you think of the methaphore
  and the overall concept. Do You think it speaks what it should? \r\n\r\nPlease,
  help. Be cruel if you have to, but... whatever. I need to know."

  body: I love the direction and aesthetic overall and will leave it to others to
    comment on specifics. To accompany your Blackface I would suggest FF Scala.
