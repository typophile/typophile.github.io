  body: "The top stroke of the upper-case 'G' terminates without an upward pointing
    serif. The foot on the G has a small forward pointing spur/serif at the base.
    \r\nThe foot on the G has a fairly thin serif on the inward side, with brackets,
    i.e. Geralde or Venetian. This type of serif is found on fonts such as Garamond.\r\nThis
    Geralde serif is inconsistent with the small triangle serif on the outward side.
    So I see editing here.\r\nI suggest that it is more likely that the designer cut
    the Geralde serif on the outside to a small triangle, rather than built up a Geralde
    serif on the inward side from a small triangle.\r\nBy this logic the other triangle
    \ serifs are also the result of cutting bracketed serifs.\r\nThere are several
    fonts with Geralde serifs that come close to the letter-forms. For example Birka
    by Franko Luin for Omnibus Typografi [1992] \r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=birka&q=Go\r\nOther
    candidates include a light weight Sabon style.\r\nDon"
