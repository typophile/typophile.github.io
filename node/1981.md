body: Hello fellow typophiles. <BR> <BR>I am working on a logo for a club.  They want
  simple, sexy, upscale, &#34;fashionista&#34;, clean and streamlined. <BR> <BR>Here
  are two beginning ideas.  Working on a straightup sans &#40;geometric&#41; version
  which I think will take the cake, but wanted to see what you all thought about these
  secondary ideas. <BR> <BR>The first one I wasn&#39;t sure if I should connect the
  letterforms or not. Thoughts?  I think they read better by not connecting the bottom
  of the c to the o. <BR> <BR>The second one, I know needs some help on that connection,
  but it&#39;s somewhat tricky since the end of the C tapers in. <BR> <BR>These are
  1st drafts, so tear em up. <BR> <BR>thanks

  body: 'another adjustment to #2.  fixed the connections, and put UNIVERS below.  not  sure
    whether APEX or univers works better.  The small caps in Apex go well with this
    this treatment, since dogma has a small x-height.   <BR> <BR>I forgot to mention
    that they want sort of an island feel if possible, hence the wave effect. <BR>
    <BR>&#40;they were going to call this place bikini!&#41; <BR> <BR>;&#41; <BR>

  body: I also like the second, nice. But I am not sure about the fonts you are using
    for the text below, I think I would go for something softer and bolder &#40;of
    course not as coco&#41;, &#34;funnier&#34; &#40;I know it is not the word&#41;,
    something in the feel of Fountain&#39;s <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp"

    <a href="http://www.garagefonts.com/detail.html?sku=GF06100811P2" target=_top>Fono
    Expanded Unicase</a> &#40;maybe too bold&#41;, or even a bold script, I don&#39;t
    know, something more ... I see your nitespots kind of serious. <BR>Well just a
    thought Peter, I like your cocologo.

    be more of an eye catcher, though &#40;and therefore preferrable?&#41;; it reminds
    me of some of those hip and sporty fashion label logos. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;d
    join the c&#39;s and the o&#39;s in the first logo: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20079.gif"

    heavier weight. <BR>And I&#39;d probably move the &#34;Nitespot&#34; a hair to
    the right. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>jpg'

  body: Iganacio...excellent choice on mayo.  My initial sketches had a font exactly
    like that. <BR> <BR>thanks. <BR> <BR>I made the subhead bolder, Hrant.   <BR>
    <BR>I have it down to apex &#40;top&#41; and mayo &#40;bottom&#41;.  I think mayo
    is the way to go.   <BR> <BR>I had to pick initial colors as well, the client
    wanted to see where I am at so they could show the contruction workers as well.
    <BR> <BR>Not 100% on the colors, picked them in 2 minutes!  But I think the darker
    blue is working nicely. <BR> <BR>I am ditching the other idea, what was I thinking
    ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback thus far.  Will posting my second idea
    later today.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20174.gif" alt="">

    Also, it would look really good with an acid green, like 390 or 389. '

  body: Nice color suggestions there.  Tiffany, that is exactly what I am aiming for.
    <BR> <BR>Hmmm...so initial client feedback is that the coco font &#40;dogma&#41;
    looks too &#39;techy&#39;. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t see it.  To me, it&#39;s more
    classic than techy.  I was trying to find some background info on dogma to support
    my opinion.  Do you guys know what dogma is based on? <BR> <BR>Also, does this
    look techy to you? <BR> <BR>[side note, the word techy has so many connotations...I&#39;ve
    had clients use that word in so many different contexts that I can&#39;t really
    gather what they mean by it anymore]

  body: 'Are you serious about the green? I don&#39;t see the correlation. On the
    west coast, late night ocean skies &#40;especially right after a red/orange sunset&#41;
    have that tint of red that Hrant was suggesting. I&#39;ll have to stand by the
    deep, red-tinted blue as my suggestion. <BR> <BR>&#34;Techy&#34;? NO WAY! First
    of all, you used the word &#34;opinion&#34;. One lesson I learned well during
    my years of in-house design, is to eliminate opinions from the equation, if at
    all possible. Focus on objectives and solutions. <BR> <BR>You have two potential
    problems here: &#40;1&#41; your client doesn&#39;t want &#34;techy&#34; so you
    need to prove that the solutions you&#39;ve shown aren&#39;t &#34;techy&#34;,
    or &#40;2&#41; your client doesn&#39;t want what you&#39;ve shown him, and he&#39;s
    incorrectly calling it &#34;techy&#34;. Either way, I&#39;d suggest collecting
    some real techno junkie examples and some great lounge neuvo samples similar to
    what you&#39;re doing. One obvious distinction I&#39;d make is that most &#34;techy&#34;
    stuff doesn&#39;t have the curvilinear elements that your &#34;coco&#34; type
    has. <BR> <BR>If your client has any true concept of &#34;techy&#34;, it&#39;s
    probably the &#34;nitespot&#34; type that has led him to this conclusion. Tiffany
    is right, though, &#34;nitespot&#34; doesn&#39;t look &#34;techy&#34; either.
    You might need to pull out the &#34;expert&#34; card here. &#34;Convince&#34;
    your client that it&#39;s not &#34;techy&#34; and it will work...that is, if you&#39;re
    confident enough that it will. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>Scott'

    if there is signage ... could spice it up. The blue that Peter chose to use isn&#39;t
    anything like the blue I&#39;m seeing on my monitor. I mean, it is blue, but it
    is more mediterranean than this. '
