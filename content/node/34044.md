  this thread is mostly directed at David Bailey although -obviously- anyone is free
  to comment. Lately I've become very interested in the work of John Langdon & I've
  been trying to make an ambigram myself  to add to my portfolio as well. With little
  succes so far, so if  anyone can give links, advice, tips,... on how to get started
  it would be much appreciated. Just for the record, I do know the easiest way to
  get started is to study other ambigrams & start off your own by writing a copy of
  your desired word flipped 180\xB0 to see what forms you'd be working with. But there
  are more ambigrams than just the single 180\xB0 words. Any usefull information or
  nice links are welcome."

    and lets you do other things with it than "just one word."

  body: I've only taking a quick glance at it now, but it certainly looks very useful.
    Thanks, Linda (and sorry for not having bothered to look through the archives
    ;-) ).

  body: "Having made a couple (not wonderful, but working) I can safely say it's flaming
    hard work. I tend to work from both ends in towards the middle. Break the letters
    down and see ifthey can  be used as other letters. \r\n\r\nHere are mine, they
    are in no way perfect, but they work. The Ninetwenty one was for a friend. The
    Weeman one is mine obviously.\r\n\r\nNinetwenty\r\nhttp://www.putfile.com/pic.php?img=4198666\r\n\r\nWeeman

  body: "I find a certain amount of calligraphy/blackletter study helps with making
    an ambigram, the swashes from calligraphy and blackletter has some basic constituent
    elements which reflect easily (that and recognising when an idea isn\u2019t working).
    Another point is that it sometimes works against the final product if you try
    to make one letter directly into its opposite, in other words, parts of one character
    can be used to form parts of the rotated, neighbouring characters.\r\nPost a sketch
    maybe somebody will have an idea/advice.\r\n\r\nTim"
