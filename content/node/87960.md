body: "Classifciation of Arabic script styles is not quite consistent. In my latest
  blog article on [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com|arabictype.wordpress.com]] I try
  to discuss a new approach to Arabic script style classification.\r\n\r\nBased on
  the six script style elements suggested in an earlier article, I suggest a method
  to quantify the visual aspects of the style. These elements could be then processed
  in a number of ways. When cobined with XML coding, it might be possible to classify
  Arabic script. The suggested classification and quantification could find use in
  applications such as font substitution in portable documents, e.g. HTML, PDF, etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yaqoutsmall_6544.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  article also shows how to programmatically control Adobe Illustrator through a downloadable
  example that relates to the article. The article contnains posters of traditional
  script sample for download.\r\n"
