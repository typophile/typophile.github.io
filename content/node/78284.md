  I want to move the the second line to left a little until the dot line. I tried
  to insert em or n space on the end of right, but it doesn't work. Pls help me. Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/align_4904.JPG]"

  body: "I'm not sure why InDesign behaves that way, but it's not good technique anyway
    to use blank spaces to adjust alignment.  It's better to use tabs or indents for
    precise control.\r\n\r\nI've found tabs in right-aligned text to be a little tricky
    (probably because I just don't do that very often), so I'd probably use use a
    \"right indent\" to shift that line over. That setting can be accessed in the
    control panel at the top of your window. However it will adjust the entire paragraph
    that you've selected, so you'd need to make a hard return above and below that
    line (rather than the soft returns you have now) so that InDesign views that line
    as a separate paragraph. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/right-indent_5260.jpg]"
