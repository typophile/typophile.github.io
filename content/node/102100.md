  named \"Mher Urdu Naskh Font\", that has complete support of Urdu characters.  \r\nThis
  font is consist of My fathers Calligraphy, and I had made this font with the complete
  consensus with my father. Who is a famous and Internationally award holder Calligrapher
  of Pakistan.\r\n\r\nI made especial work for the Urdu Letter \u06D2 \"Bari yeh\".
  The letters ends on Bari Yeh are commonly not correctly typed in any font. I made
  work in this regard and in my font all words ending of Bari yeh are typed correctly.
  TIts Positioning, shape and dot/nuqta below placement is according to International
  standards of Naskh Calligraphy. \r\n\r\nNow I working on kashida support for this
  font..\r\nSome work of calligraphy is also pending in this font because I put most
  concentration of Volt work other than the shapes of characters, I tried to make
  this font as base for all other Urdu Fonts. \r\n\r\nHere you can see the sample
  of my Naskh font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quran arabic_4344.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mher_4481.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mher
