  body: "Frankenstein was sewn by hand, this was stitched by machine. A blow up of
    the details, fuzzy but reveals some forensics:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SewingDetail_5842.jpg]\r\nAt
    least some of the serifs and general proportions of some of the letters such as
    _G_ might be a similar to the neo-Venetian Schneidler http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-schneidler/\r\nThe
    _E_ is an Uncial style. See for example Uncial Antiqua http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stiggy-sands/uncial-antiqua-pro/
    or Marceta http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/finefonts/marceta/ or the \"post-histroical\"
    Jana Thork http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/jana-thork/ Easy to make by putting
    a crossbar on _C_\r\nThe initial curl swash -- a nice \"feminine\" touch that
    appears nowhere else in the letters --  is available on various fonts such as
    Bookmania\r\nThe leg of _R_ looks like it was taken from a heavy Bodoni and pasted
    on a Trajan style  _P_ with an open bowl.\r\nPerhaps some creative soul has made
    this into a Biker Bride of Frankenstein font and shared it with the world.\r\nDon\r\n"
