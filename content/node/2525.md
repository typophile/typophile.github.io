body: A bit of a posting spree here... <BR> <BR>Another MT font, similar in style
  to Dorothy. Like the majority of my fonts, I designed it with decorative useage
  in mind. However, I find that it doesn&#39;t look that bad set as a text font. Sort
  of a stylized Sans or something. <BR> <BR>The numbers need a bit of work, I think,
  but on the whole, I enjoy the balance of this character set. Perhaps the lc x and
  uc x and y betray the rounded style of the other characters? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22974.gif"
