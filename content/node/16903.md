    to have a beer. I also need to know about the bookshops, but hopefully Adam and
    Verena will be around to show me those.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Laurence\r\n"

    also the Bauhaus Museum.  Have fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new york times gives a
    rundown of some clubs in berlin:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Club Scene, on the Edge\r\nBy
    SUNSHINE FLINT \r\n\r\nPublished: December 12, 2004\r\n\r\nMix Williamsburg in
    Brooklyn with the Lower East Side, add a Teutonic accent and you've got the increasingly
    hip Berlin neighborhood Friedrichshain. It is home to both students and slackers,
    as a cracking night life has sprung up in the shadow of the Ostbahnhof, the main
    train station in the former East Berlin.\r\n\r\nSeparated from western Berlin
    by the River Spree and, until 1989, the Berlin Wall, this part of Friedrichshain
    was lucky to avoid the fate of other East Berlin swathes that were razed and rebuilt
    with plattenbau, the Communist-era concrete-slab apartments. Prewar buildings
    and narrow, cobblestone streets give it a neighborhood feel.\r\n\r\nBut history
    is never far away. Visitors can indulge in the current nostalgia for the days
    of the German Democratic Republic by viewing the longest remaining section of
    the Berlin Wall at the East Side Gallery, along the Spree. It includes the famous
    portrait of Erich Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev in a passionate clinch. Despite
    sporadic attempts to preserve it, much of the masonry is weathering and defaced
    by graffiti.\r\n\r\nThis kind of solid G.D.R. street cred is what the night life
    of Berlin has been craving, and Friedrichshain is the kind of neighborhood it
    has been colonizing since 1989. There's still room there for illegal clubs and
    the geheimetipp, the in place. This is usually a club or bar that opens in an
    abandoned building or courtyard for a month or a week or even a night. But permanent
    bars have made the scene, too.\r\n\r\nAs in most neighborhoods on the cusp, though,
    the original residents and the scenesters rarely meet. You won't find an old Ossi
    inside a new bar and you won't find a hipster in a neighborhood kniepe.\r\n\r\nWhile
    prices in Friedrichshain are lower than in western Berlin, the weak dollar means
    that cocktails cost much the same as in New York. (A mojito is around $8 or $9,
    at $1.35 to the euro.) The night life in Berlin has an egalitarian tradition,
    and there's rarely a velvet rope or a bouncer passing judgment on who gets in.
    Some of the dance clubs charge entrance fees - ranging from about $8 to $25.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a sampling of the hottest spots. Things are generally at their swingiest between
    10 p.m. and 2 a.m. at the bars, while the dance clubs go till the wee hours.\r\n\r\nAt
    Habermayer, 6 G\xE4rtnerstrasse, (49-30) 2977-1887, a dragged-out D.J. in a red-sequined
    dress does her thing while the bartender charges a 1-euro deposit on pint glasses
    to deter pilfering. The 70's mod design - low couches and round plastic stools
    - isn't overdone.\r\n\r\nAstro-Bar, 40 Simon-Dach-Strasse, (49-173) 768-2625,
    is a smoke-filled spot on the neighborhood's main drag. Monstrous East German
    computers hang from the walls near the bar, and customers line up to play old-fashioned
    pinball machines in the back.\r\n\r\nThe Lee Harvey Oswald Bar, 68 Gr\xFCnberger
    Strasse, (49-30) 4401-7400, is the best bar in the poorest of taste. Mod red and
    white strips go around the small bar while a dozen televisions play a continuous
    loop of Oswald's arrest and his shooting death at the hands of Jack Ruby. D.J.'s
    play American music from New Wave to 60's soul to rhythm and blues.\r\n\r\nWatergate
    - what's next, the Monica? - 49 Falckensteinstrasse, (49-30) 6128-0394, across
    the Warschauer Bridge, on the Kreuzberg side of the river, is a two-story industrial
    club that packs them in with big-name D.J.'s from around Europe. After paying
    the $13.50 admission, clubgoers can stay on the main floor or check out the scene
    on the Water Floor, which overlooks the river and the skyline of eastern Berlin.
    There's even a V.I.P. lounge, which may be a portent of things to come.\r\n\r\nLast
    year's hottest club, Ostgut/Panorama Bar, 70 R\xFCdersdorfer Strasse, (49-30)
    2900-0597, is reopening in new digs. Ostgut was known for its gay/straight mix
    and Saturday night techno parties that drew a liberated, body-conscious crowd.
    The new Panorama Bar has a rotating lineup of D.J.'s on Friday and Saturday nights.\r\n\r\n"
