		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant:</p>
<p>[[Theo Rehak]] of the Dale Guild is the man to speak to about the disposition of the ATF equipment. The sad news is that the junkmen were standing by at the auction a few years ago, and the largest part of the battery of fifty or so Barth casters and the hand and steam pivotal (Bruce-like machines) were trucked off for scrap. A part of the holding of matrices met the same fate. The scope of the machinery (weight) was just too overwhelming for the average person to cart away. Barth casters went for about twenty-five dollars. Benton pantographs for a few hundred dollars. Most of the six Bentons were saved and trucked off by people who are, fortunately, using them.</p>
<p>The good news is that about twenty or so Barth casters were saved and are being used by enthusiasts. A large part of the matrices were also saved by several individuals.</p>
<p>[[Rich Hopkins]] of the Hill and Dale Letter Foundry in Terra Alta WV has rescued a lot of them. Some he has cast in recent years.</p>
<p>[[Greg Walters]] of Piqua, Ohio has a few of the Barth Casters from the sale, and I believe a small selection of the Matrices.</p>
<p>[[Dan Carr]], who operates the Golgonooza (this is a real name) Letter Foundery in Ashuelot, NH has a Large point size Kustermann caster that had been used by Theo for a few years. He passed it on the Dan, who by the way, is a hand punchcutter, and has done a lovely 16 point roman book face.</p>
<p>Another man who can give you lots of information is [[Stan Nelson]], who is a printing historian/technician at the Smithsonian Museum of Modern History, and is also a punchcutter. He has been archiving a few tons of the ATF matrices which were given to the Smithsonian in, I think, the mid-seventies. These mats are from the ATF &ldquo;housecleaning&rdquo; of afew decades ago. Apparently they were presented to the Smithsonian as a dumped pile, which was loaded with snow shovels to take away. The story is that they suffered little damage by this treatment.</p>
<p>[[Paul Duensing]] in Watkinsville GA is truly the dean of avocational typefounding in the world. He has so much knowledge of the status of the matrix holdings of the great foundries of Europe. About 15 years ago he cut a 30 pt Civilite for Hermann Zapf. Harold Berliner, Nevada City, CA made me a gift of a font for lending them one of my home-made matrix holders so that they could cast a subscription of 30 fonts. Paul is also a close friend of Schumaker Gebler (forgive my spelling of his name) who has a boggling matrix collection from Stempel, Enschede and other foundries, along with a large functioning battery of foundry casters. Last month I received a gorgeous little brochure from Germany and since I speak no German, I could only sort of guess that it was announcing the final opening of the big Foundry Museum in Germany. I will dig it up . . . in the foundry somewhere.</p>
<p>One parting item: [[Chris Stern]] of Grey Spider Press in Sedro Wooley, WA came up to visit me yersterday for the purpose of cutting hanging figs to go with Futura. We got all the patterns cut, and the two rough cuts on all of the matrices. Next week we will do the final finish cut. Chris, incidentally, has five or six Monotype caster, about half of them recondiitoned and operating. He casts type for the School of Visual Concepts in Seattle. They have a very lively program.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contacting any of these people, give me your Email address, and I will get you contact info on these folks. You have your work cut out for you in tracking the ATF material. The good part is that any of it that exists is in the hand of some known person, you just have to pull it all together.</p>
<p>This got a little wordy, but there is a lot going on in metal foundry these days.</p>
<p>Jim Rimmer</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Another person who was at the ATF auction and may have information is David Pankow at the Carey Collection at RIT. He gave an interesting and at times moving lecture about the rise and fall of ATF at the 1994 ATypI conference in San Francisco, culminating in his description of the auction. The scrap dealers were indeed standing by, and seem to have carried of the bulk of the stuff, including many matrices. Pankow himself was able to save a few designs for the Carey Collection, I believe.</div>

Some nice designs also. Consider language, font schemes vary radically between them.

		<div class="commentbody">I can't quite recall whether Rich Hopkins got the ATF matrices for Garamond or Baskerville, but I seem to remember that he has one series of the other. You might want to check it out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other happenings: I have recently completed the cutting of Matrices for Carl Dair's Cartier Roman. I have had the patterns which I made for both the Roman and Italic just sitting around the foundry for a few years. Just didn't have the time to get to cutting punches, which was my original intent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In May of this year I was slated to make a presentation to the Type Club of Toronto, and shamed myself into getting back on the Cartier. Not enough time to cut punches, so I made another (intaglio) set of patterns at a 12-1 scale and cut direct mats. I'll get around to cutting the French accents after October. Since the mats were angraved directly, it is necessary to hand dress all the letters as they come off the caster. Poo! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you are into  little type news: I took a graduating Graphic Design student from Emily Carr Inst. on for a semester of Mondays. He wanted to further his type knowledge. I dropped him in at the deep end of the pool, and suggested that he engrave a small type project. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He selected Victor Hammer's American Uncial. We came to the conclusion that if he did only the lowercase and a cap I, along with the punctuation and figs, that he could complete the project. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I taught him the bare-bones basics of Fontographer, and he made his outlines with it. Using FWG's method, he cut bristol board patterns, which were then engraved at 2-1 into lead plate. These were used to cut the 14 point mats. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end, he took away his patterns, the mats and a case of type. The last two days were used up in his setting and printing a limited edition broadsheet with the type. This bright young man's name is Dale Davies. Following his project, another student came for five weeks to do the same thing. I felt the time was too tight, so we settled on her cutting a glyph of her name Kan. In this case she freehanded the drawing from an existing Chinese glyph, and following the same steps cut a mat in 18 point. I steered her into recutting another pattern flopped so that she could print it on her broadseet as a faint grey image, along with the 18 point type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both students were very tweeked about carrying on at a later date on their own. This is very possible since the machines for cutting type are dirt cheap. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The purpose of my writing this here is to mention that I would like to have, at least one year,  two or three interetsed people come and spend two days with me to learn the basics of the process. I think the most logical thing would be to have them design and cut a dingbat/leaf, or the like, in 18 point. This could easily be done over two days. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There would be no charge, and there is affordable B&amp;B spots in the neighborhood. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Somebody ought to take me up on this, becasue I am not getting younger, and I would dearly like to see the craft carry on. In the final analysis, the knowledge that one picks up is not geared solely to letterpress; at least that's the way I see it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry for the crazy digression. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">John Hudson <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It will be possible to cut a steel punch also, although it is easier to cut a matrix directly. I have not cut more than a dozen punches, preferring to take the coward's way out and cut typemetal patrixes (I don't know how to pluralize patrix) for elctrolapting, and then the few suites of directly engraved brass matices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have the process for punch cutting pretty well standardized, and can do a good punch in a few hours.

		<div class="commentbody">You folks don't let any moss grow on you. I have had a few interetsed parties contact me regarding the free type engraving workshop. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firstly I have extended an invitation to anyone attending ATypI 2003 to break away in the evening or in the days following the Conference if possible I realize that everyone will be busy schmoozing and what not, but if you can get away, I'd love to give you a tour, with casters running. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the soonest I can manage a workshop would be about mid November (with a little flexibility in establishing a date, based upon you being able to get here) and another in the Spring of 2004. This would be about late April or early May. Again this will need to be worked out with potential attendees. Probably the best thing would be for me to give you each other's Email address, and you could duke it out regarding the dates. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keep in touch, and we'll get something going. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While you are here, I have an Ikarus setup for digital type, that you might get a kick out of. It's really a very refined and easy program to use. Very friendly to pencil outlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More later . . .  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
