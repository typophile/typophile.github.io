body: I'm an in-house designer working for a bank. We've been using the font Myriad
  Pro for the last few years in adverting and display. While I like that it's an accessible
  and friendly font. I am looking for ideas to replace it with another san-serif font.
  Perhaps one that has more energy or variety. It still needs to look professional
  for a bank though. Any thoughts?
