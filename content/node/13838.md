  of the bold grotesque or geometric variety. \r\n\r\nOr actually any interesting
  ligatures in sans typefaces?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nEd"

    Sans</a> has ligatures, and I assume <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/jsans.html">John
    Sans</a> does too.

    is an unusual monoline sans or semi-sans that goes completely wild with ligatures,
    including the st. Tankard calls it an ''upright script.'' Check out the PDFs for
    all the ligatures.  '

    are spectacular, but the Fedra Sans Display & Sebastian Black are what I was most
    after.\r\n\r\nEd\r\n\r\n[EDIT] ps. I was looking for inspiration for a logo. Part
    of the (draft) result is <a href=\"http://www.edeverett.co.uk/linked/ckst.gif\">here</a>.
    The st ligature kind of grew into ckst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    little back into the stem. I think the \"c\" could get a little wider too, it's
    almost not a \"c\" anymore. And, the inside curve of the st connection flattens
    out a little too much at the top. \r\n\r\nI don't know if you're looking for a
    design critique but it's Friday and I have time to kill before my costume party
    tonight (I'm going as a PMS 801 C chip!). Goodluck. = )"

  body: "Thanks for the comments, I wasn't really looking for a critique just giving
    a little context to my question. I know the k looks a bit like an R but that is
    fixed a bit by other letters in the logo with ascenders. I didn't show the whole
    logo as my client is a bit cagey about talking about the project before it is
    launched. \r\n\r\nI've got to learn to stop showing unfinished or partial work!
    But I'll look again at the width of the c and the top of the k.\r\n\r\nThanks"
