  body: Hische's script fits with Anderson's style with the same rightness that Futura
    belongs in Kubrick's. Good-hearted, but quirky and almost twee.

    obvious to anyone with\u2026what?\u2026eyes?\r\n\r\nOTOH, I must confess that
    I assume that you are not impaired in any way; however, the internet is not always

    believe it or not, was all in fun, spoken both kindly and gently. And, BTW, IMHO\u2014this

  body: "I saw her talk at Typo San Francisco, and was indeed impressed.\r\nBut as
    she admitted, there\u2019s a lot to learn about making fonts.\r\nThis is her second
    version of this typeface, and much better than the \uFB01rst (Butter- something
    or other).\r\nIt will be interesting to see what direction her career goes.\r\n"
