  --- but its STILL not the same font. the characters have these... connecting wave-type
  things, its not flat at the bottom, like on bjorks album.   please email me with

  body: I have no idea whether or not this is the actual font, or a reverse engineered
    clone, but you can find it <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=502&amp;page=2">here</a>.
    My suspicion is that the font is custom designed by <a href="http://www.mmparis.com/">mm
    paris</a>, the designers of the vespertine artwork. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the best
    I can do...

  body: I agree with Karl. I think it has been pretty much determined in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22318.html">this
    thread</a> and <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1365.html#POST4267">this
    thread</a> that the Vespertine typeface was most likely a custom design. I would
    dearly love to see it released...
