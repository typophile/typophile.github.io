body: Does anyone know where I can find what languages are covered by what [[Unicode]]
  blocks. For example, Is there a list somewhere that tells what languages Latin 1
  + Latin Extended A will cover? I assume this is on the Unicode website, but i haven't
  seen a more unnavigable site in my life. if anyone can link me to this info, i'd
  appreciate it.

  body: "Paul, I believe you'll find that information on the actual paper documenting
    the standard. PDFs here: http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/\r\n\r\nExamples
    from the European Alphabetic Scripts section:\r\n\r\n<strong>Letters of the Latin-1
    Supplement: U+00C0\u2013U+00FF</strong> (p. 167)\r\nThe languages supported by
    the Latin-1 supplement include Danish, Dutch, Faroese, Finnish, Flemish, German,
    Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.\r\n\r\n<strong>Latin
    Extended-A: U+0100\u2013U+017F</strong> (p. 168)\r\nMost languages supported by
    this block also require the concurrent use of characters contained in the Basic
    Latin and Latin-1 Supplement blocks. When combined with these two blocks, the
    Latin Extended-A block supports Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Croatian,
    Czech, Esperanto, Estonian, French, Frisian, Greenlandic, Hungarian, Latin, Latvian,
    Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Proven\xE7al, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romanian, Romany, Sami,
    Slovak, Slovenian, Sorbian, Turkish, Welsh, and many others.\r\n"

  body: The lists to which Miguel refers are not exhaustive, but they are a good start.
    The Latin Extended B block supports a very large number of African languages when
    used in conjunction with combining diacritical marks, but most of these are not
    named in the text.
