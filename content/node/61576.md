body: "Indento\u2122 is a multi-purpose modern geometric slab serif for headlines,
  posters, branding but fairly legible to be used as longer text. The straight and
  rounded corners combined with deep cuts and asymmetric serifs gives it a distinctive
  look while still keeping its rigorousness and legibility.\r\n\r\nThe family consist
  of three weights, each with a companying italic. The extensive character set - 513
  glyphs in each font - includes support for Central and Eastern European languages
  and OpenType features like small caps, ligatures, fractions, slashed zero, stylistic
  alternates and more. See\_<a href=\"http://mugurmihai.com/pdf023/Indento.pdf\">PDF
