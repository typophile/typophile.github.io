  body: "1. dummsumm, please remove your image. Has nothing to do with spike4all's
    ID request.\r\n2. \"founder\" is a small scale image and has no earmark letters
    so it's difficult to say with any certainty what it is. This very clipped style
    shouts Dax, created by Hans Reichel from 1995 onwards. There are some similar
    fonts that have the straight e rather than the slanted e in founder. One is <a

    by  Ingo Preuss in 2006.\r\nDon\r\n"
