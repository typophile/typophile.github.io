  New Orleans and Loyola University New Orleans will hold its second annual Green
  Salon on March 14th at Loyola. The all-day event will feature presentations and
  panel discussions about the nature of sustainability and what the New Orleans community
  can do to become more sustainable.\r\n\r\nThis event will be webcast in real time!!\r\n\r\nSalon
  will focus on the question \u201CHow can I make a difference?\u201D Keynote speaker,
  Elllen Lupton.\r\n\r\nThe day will address these issues:\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to
  act in a sustainable manner in my use of energy?\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to act in
  a sustainable manner in my use of materials and construction?\r\n\r\nHow do I act
  in a sustainable manner when thinking about issues pertaining to social justice?\r\n\r\nIn
  keeping with New Orleans\u2019 rich musical culture, 2009 Green Salon will also
  feature local bands entertaining us in between each of these notions.\r\n\r\n\u201CSustainability\u201D
  and \u201CGreen\u201D have become buzzwords for environmentally friendly practices,
  but the terminology\u2019s meanings are often lost in vague or overwrought descriptions
  that overwhelm the average person, who cannot understand what to do as an individual.\r\n\r\nOur
  purpose at 2009 Green Salon is to cut through the murkiness, discussing how environmental
  issues affect us and the changes each person can make. By bringing together experts
  from many fields making an impact on sustainability, we will explore contributions
  that can reduce waste and create a more sustainable community.\r\n\r\nThe event
  is FREE OF CHARGE. Food and drink will be available to purchase and donations are
  welcome which go to the annual Green Salon fund servicing the general New Orleans
  community.\r\n\r\nNancy Sharon Collins, Director of Special Events, AIGA New Orleans,
