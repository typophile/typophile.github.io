body: "Design Brief \u2013 Logo\r\nThe Geelong Football Umpires' League provides umpires
  to officiate community level Australian Rules Football matches across several competitions
  in the Geelong and greater Barwon region of south west Victoria in Australia. We
  are a Not-For-Profit organization of just over 300 members who officiate at senior
  and junior level competitions. There are two primary target audiences apart from
  our active membership:\r\n(1)\tThe prospective recruiting group from ages 13 to
  30 and \r\n(2)\tThe other stakeholders of Aussie Rules competitions in our region
  including over 5,000 player participants, club and league officials and their supporters.\r\nUmpiring
  local Aussie Rules football is our sport; we do it to be involved in the game we
  enjoy; it is our recreation and hobby; we aim to have fun but we also take our officiating
  as serious business to support the game properly without fear or favour. \r\nYour
  task is to develop a new logo. This logo, along with the words Geelong Umpires will
  be used to represent the Geelong Football Umpires' League.  Your design needs to
  incorporate both graphic and text elements. \r\n\r\n\r\nGFUL Logo design: From my
  research I found that they're uniforms are organge and black so I wanted to incorporate
  that into my design somehow. I also wanted the word \"umpires\" to stand out most
  and look strong as the umpires are who control and officiate the game. Personally
  when I think of AFL umpires I think of their hand signals when a team scores points
  so that was the the main image I wanted to use. I also used the shape of a football
  to border the type and graphics used.\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to use a football shape, I'd try to keep the logo that shape, rather than putting
    it in a box. \"Geelong\" looks almost like an afterthought in that small, handwritten
    font; I'd make it big and bold, probably centered over Umpires. I'm not sure what
    that thick black line is supposed to represent (hand signal? map?); I'd avoid
    mixing too many different elements in a logo. Keep it simple.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest
    putting Geelong and Umpires in the same font, bigger, delete the box and the odd
    black line, make the ball orange and the type white, and see how that looks. (Is
    this mostly for men? If so I might pick a font that look a bit more bold and angular.)\r\n\r\nDesigning
    a logo is hard, keep working on it!"

  body: "Thank you so much for your feedback. My close family and friends don't want
    to hurt my feelings so I'm continually getting \"that looks great\", which isn't
    helping me in the long run. \r\n\r\nI didn't mean to box it as such I was more
    so putting it on an orange background as that is the colour of their t-shirt.
    So I would have been better off actually putting the logo on an orange T-shirt
    to show where I was coming from? \r\n\r\nI really wanted to steer away from using
    a football as that seems to be everyone's idea. With the thick black line it is
    supposed to be the hand signal for when they award points but it's not obvious
    enough I've come to realise. Originally I just had that line but it didn't 'scream'
    aussie rules football so that's why i gave it the football shape.\r\n\r\nI'll
    take on board what you've said and make a few adjustments, thank you :-)\r\n\r\nI
    did just have another play around with and rearranged the two images. Family and
    friends like it better because the hand signal is more obvious but I'm thinking
    it's possibly, again, too many elements?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geelong-umpires-logo-idea-2_4057.jpg]"

  body: "Agreed. It's currently to busy. Simplify. Your original start wasn't to bad.
    I might suggest removing the hand/arm illustration and simply focus on the football
    shape and four lines representing what I think is the football grip area. The
    suggestion of centering would be a great way to create hierarchy. Font choices
    might need a little attention. They currently don't say athletes/sports. Here's
    a super quick sketch. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo1_3918.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I would suggest not outlining any fonts. Personal preference. =) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    too many elements going on. Also I changed the font as many suggested what I had
    wasn't cutting it. My assessor also wanted me to work with one of my original

    looks a bit odd to me, but it's a big improvement!
