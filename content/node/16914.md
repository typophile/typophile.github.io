body: "This is a feat that aludes me. I've never had a \"True Eye\" for choosing color
  or creating applicable color combinations that seem to add to the work than deter
  from it. I understand the fundamentals of color and have a decent understanding
  of color theory, but still I come up very short when making qualified color choices.
  So, I started searching for something to make the process alittle easier.\r\n\r\nI
  came across this nice little application: <a href=\"http://www.colorschemer.com/\">http://www.colorschemer.com/</a>
  Color Schemer Studio. \r\n\r\nIt's a nice advanced color wheel and combination developer,
  plus the website has a user added gallery of color combinations they've used that
  work well. \r\n\r\nThe only thing is, it's RGB/HEX based only. I don't do very much
  in the way of web/screen design as much as I do Print. I was wondering if any of
  you fellows have come across anything CMYK based be it a book, or a program or even
  a color blog. \r\n\r\nI believe if I can bring my abilities in color up a notch
  or two, it would be the difference between being an able designer and an excellent
  designer."

    are all free.\r\n\r\nThey should all give you values in cmyk as well as rgb and
    hex codes\r\n\r\nhttp://www.colorblender.com/\r\nhttp://www.hlrnet.com/colormatch/index.php\r\nhttp://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html\r\nhttp://www.telecable.es/personales/alberto9/color/index.htm\r\n\r\nHope
    they help - if not try typing 'colour theory' into amazon and checking out what
    comes up.\r\n\r\nd"

  body: "These are great links. Very cool.\r\n\r\n I think that working effectively
    in color is all about knowing your media's potential range.  There are huge differences
    in color gamut (range) you get when you go from paint, to ink, to computer screen,
    to film is important. It isn't just about managing color transitions across these
    media but knowing what color strengths & deficits a given media inherently has
    and exploiting these to good effect. This is perhaps more true in print than anywhere
    else which is why those pantone books & CMYK chart books are so useful. Do you
    already have those? Of course these and Color wigets can overwhelm as easily as
    they can help - especially if you don't have some initial idea of what your looking
    for or matching to. \r\n\r\nI also think that color's relationship to emotion
    & culture is never going to go away or be managed by hints or web-wigets. \r\n\r\nI
    think this last aspect is the most important, but it is only going to come from
    personal feeling, experience & insight. Color is personal, regional, and is age
    related. And then there is fashion. All in all it's tough to grasp color. Thats
    why I think a personal sense of color is what is required. Then you can check
    your choices against the context of the client, target audience, culture, media/technology
    etc.\r\n\r\nI like your idea for a color blog!\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of things do
    you design in print? Can you show us examples of work you felt succeeded using
    color & work that fell short?"

  body: "A tool for CMYK similar to the one on the website mentioned would have to
    be a book, not a program, simply because you're not going to get anything approaching
    true CMYK (subtractive) color from RGB (additive) color rendering. While RGB colors
    are rendered by mixing light in a black box (almost infinitely variable and thermodynamically
    reversible), CMYK colors are produced by mixing inks and applying them to white
    paper (also quite variable, but thermodynamically irreversible).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    this doesn't preclude using an RGB tool to come up with pleasing color combinations:
    the trick comes in finding CMYK formulas (in, say, the Pantone Process Color Guide)
    which match the colors you choose. However, be aware that process color is notoriously
    ineffective at reproducing clean greens and oranges (which is why they developed
    the Hexachrome system). Still, with a lot of practice and with the right lighting
    setup, you could probably get pretty proficient at coming up with printable equivalents."

    the ColourLovers site... (that's colour with a 'u')\r\n\r\nhttp://colourlovers.com
    \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm verging on phobic as far as colour is concerned; I'm red/green
    colourblind (to a degree, it's not terrible and rarely causes me a problem), but
    it's always good to bounce the idea of what colour you'd like to use off someone
    you trust."
