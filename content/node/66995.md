  tried to create (the very beginning, first tests) my blog here in typophile.\r\nAnd
  I have a question about the \u201Etags\u201C.\r\nI  thought it works in the way
  that in this line you enter certain keywords that letter can be found with Google,
  for example.\r\nBut it doesn\u2019t work well.\r\nI entered there for example my
  name and an title with brackets \"xx\" at the beginning and the end and tried to
  find them in Google without success.\r\nWhy? What I am doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your answers and remember in these things I am a total beginner ;-)\r\n\r\nStefan"

    if and when it will work again, would find tags immediately.\r\nBy the way, here
    are all the tags:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/tags"

  body: "Google spiders the whole site quite regularly, or at least I've used it to
    find my posts. However, I haven't really used tags so I've been using search terms
    that would appear in the page content, not the meta tags. \r\n\r\nOne way to get
    your posts ranking more visibly on Google would be to link to them both within
    Typophile and from external sites. "
