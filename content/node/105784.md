  body: "The font used in the samples is Linotype's hot metal Old Style No. 1 with
    Ronaldson conversion. I measured the type and think it is 10 pt.\r\n\r\nFYI, the
    Ronaldson conversion characters are /C /E /F /G /L /S /T /AE /OE and /ct in the
    Roman, Small Caps and Italic. In addition, in the Roman are these:  /3 /5 /6 /7
    /9 and  /.  /:\r\n\r\nWhoever typeset it was pretty sloppy with their use of the
    Ronaldson conversion characters, mixing the normal characters and Ronaldson conversion
    characters, sometimes in the same word. This probably happened because the conversion
    characters got mixed into the font's magazine by mistake.\r\n"

  body: "George, interesting, thanks. \r\n\r\nBy \u201CRonaldson conversion characters\u201D
    you obviously refer to the occasional capitals that have the little tick marks
    on the line ends for the characters & numbers you list. \r\nAs for, \u201CWhoever
    typeset it was pretty sloppy with their use of the Ronaldson conversion characters
    \u2026\u201D, Yes: jilting to read \u2013 over and above the fact that whole paragraphs
    are set in all caps. \r\n\r\nBut, I believe you may have solved the mystery of:
    Why did the publishing organization revert back to the first edition\u2019s typeface
    (Century Schoolbook) for the Third Edition? They would have wanted to put the
    mish-mash that came out in this Second Edition behind them as soon as possible.
    I believe this also accounts for the Second Edition\u2019s rarity \u2013 no desire
    for second or more imprints.\r\n\r\nAs for \u201CRonaldson conversion\u201D, Google
    of \u201CLinotype Ronaldson conversion Old Style\u201D returned a link to: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/19769\r\n\r\nWhich
    pointed to a bit of a history lesson here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nPaul\r\n"
