  We want to keep the type beautiful, crafted and yet humanist. Our thinking ws to
  give Stag Rounded a tryout for the headers and maybe the sans for the body, but
  the sans isn't quite hitting the mark. We wondered about using Gotham or Whitney
  but again something missing. We'd like to keep the rounded element, so can anyone
  suggest pairings for Stag rounded? Serif or sans would be welcome at this point
  - just remember it's about Jazz!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: It looks to me that Stag Sans might work if you set it tighter - that gives
    it more weight on the page. Gotham is nice as is Verlag.
