  for the words "THE MECHANICAL MAN".  Any help would be greatly appreciated as this
  project is on a short time frame.

  body: Looks like one of these letterpress faces that didn't make it to digital.
    Since it's all made up of straight lines, why don't you trace it?

    noggin' there's a good chance it ain't digitized yet)"

  body: 'This was probably off of a thermographically printed business card from the
    80s. Looks familiar to me, but I wonder if it isn''t just reminding me of something
    else. Yves is all knowing (usually) so I''d agree with him. '

  body: "This IS off of a thermographic business card.  The problem is the customer
    can not get a hold of the original art and doesn't know where to find it.  I don't
    think it is from the 80's but I could be wrong.  I am actually redrawing the logo
    for an outsourced thermography job.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Daniel"
