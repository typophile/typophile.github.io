  body: Either that or <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep?cview=P71942S&amp;clist=PS"
    target="_blank">FF Sari</a>. The two fonts are very similar because they are by
    the same designer, Hans Reichel, who did Sari after failing to come to an agreement
    over his earlier design with Berthold Types when they acquired the H. Berthold
    type library. &#40;I only just learned this today <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?4100/37440"

  body: 'FF Sari dont match &#40;the R for example&#41;. I think I think you are right
    about Barmeno. The sample I posted must have been deformed this looks like bermeno
    at its 80% width. Thank you very much Mr. Simonson. <BR>And what do you think
    about a typeface like this being used as newspaper headline? I post here more
    of that newspaper page: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37584.jpg"

  body: It seems a bit informal for a newspaper, but it&#39;s quite legible &#40;or
    it seems to be--I don&#39;t read Spanish :-&#41;.

  body: Yes it is legible. <BR> <BR>It seems this newspaper loves distorted type.
    I think all type has been horizontally scaled. <BR> <BR>jmc _=&#43;

  body: 'What I don&#39;t like is the sans serif &#40;futura?&#41; for the pull quotes.
    Especially since it doesn&#39;t match the text font. '

    Condensed for body text? :-/
