  been asked before. I have the job of purchasing a font library for our Repro. department,
  the question is \" Which is the best suited for a Repro department, Open Type or
  Postscript? \"\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    that most printers made in the last few years can handle other formats just fine.
    If that's the case, the only thing preventing you from using OpenType is if you're
    not using Adobe CS and you need to get to small caps and other extra glyphs. \r\n\r\nBy
    and large, if you want to avoid support headaches, OpenType is the cleanest way
    to go."

  body: "I agree with Stephen. OpenType is fully compatible with MAC/PC, it has a
    very extended charset and (in my epxerience) chars are rendered much better on
    PC's monitor. Therefore:\r\n\r\n1 OpenType (if it is available for the font/family);\r\n2
    PostScript;\r\n3 TrueType."

  body: "Thanks for that,\r\nThese fonts will be used in a mainly Mac environment
    with CS2, CS3 and Quark 6 & 7. The rips are reasonably up to date so hopefully
    there should be no problem there.\r\nWe were looking at purchasing The Adobe Type
    Collection (Open Type Edition) and the Monotype Library, so as you can imagine
    it's a big investment to make when there are several choices available.\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "OpenType is the only way to go and I highly recommend it. InD supports OpenType
    more and more as you get to the current CS3 revision. Quark 6 will allow use of
    OpenType fonts with the same functionality as the old Type 1 fonts but new OpenType
    features are not supported until you get to Quark 7 or later. Quark 7 does not
    support Stylistic Sets though. As an investment, buying Type 1 fonts are sort
    of like buying VHS instead of DVD movies. They will work as long as you have the
    equipment (as is certainly the case now) but are limited in features and an unknown
    for future systems and software. There certainly is no advantage in Type 1 fonts,
    that is for sure.\r\nSoTA members and TypeCon attendees will receive a copy of
    the soon to be printed \"Interrobang\" journal with a lengthy article about OpenType
    fonts. If you are not already a member of SoTA, you might think about joining.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typesociety.org/\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'When some users first encounter the more advanced features of OpenType, they
    sometimes worry that these are vendor-specific technologies or that these features
    could end up in an evolutionary cul-de-sac, like Multiple Masters. A great deal
    of this technology, however, was created by the major platform vendors to accommodate
    different languages. As such, these are core components that will be in use for
    the foreseeable future. Buying high-quality OpenType fonts now could be compared
    to buying a Type 1 font in 1990. It''s going to be the format of choice for at
    least the next decade, and application support will only get better over time. '
