body: "Hello Community,\r\n\r\ni've got a big problem. This: there is a logo of a
  company i'm working for. The logo includes a little bit of text. Now i/we need to
  edit this logo, but i don't know the name of the font. Nobody in this company knows,
  cause the old designer is not very cooperative and dosn't want to help anything.
  So nobody knows this font. Maybe you can give me an hint, what it can be. I attached
  the logo to this post. If it dosn't work, you can see the logo at the head-area
  on [[http://www.missingscout.com]].\r\n\r\nI would be so happy, if u can help me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-missingscout-personensuche_5300.jpg]"
