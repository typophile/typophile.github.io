  body: Must be custom. I downloaded the PDF of the "Zoom" brochure in which the screen
    grab comes from. I opened it in Illustrator, the Typeface seems to be called ASM.
    I've been looking for a typeface that is called ASM and didn't find anything.
    The brochure was designed by Andreas Hidber, I sent him an email to see if it
    was possible to purchase the font, but I haven't heard from him yet!
