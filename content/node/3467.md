body: If I use this ampersand, I would modify it some, and kill the rough edges to
  meld better with Waters Titling.. <BR> <BR>This is for a group of personal trainers.
  They have a heavy focus on a holistic approach. We are trying to target more of
  the female demographic, without alienating any of the male. <BR> <BR>Does this strike
  you as too femenin? Ideas? Comments? <BR> <BR>Also, how does the name, and tagline
  fall with you guys? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: Or &#34;Your Holistic Training Experience&#34;? <BR> <BR>When I say it outloud
    the words &#34;fitness&#34; and &#34;holistic&#34; stick together a little bit
    like peanut butter and jelly.

  body: 'Pretty nice - not <i>too</i> feminine, I don&#39;t think. The font matching
    is great. And that ampersand &#40;why change it?&#41; looks totally like a  yoga
    position. <BR> <BR>As for the tagline, I think it needs to be more... holistic!  :-&#41;
    <BR>Something like this: &#34;Holistic '

    Here is a bit of an update -- cleaned up the ampersand. <BR> <BR>HP: I actually
    do have a really deep raspberry color in my color scheme. Rich earthy type colors.
    <BR> <BR>Adriano: Being used at the sizes it will mostly be used at, I dont think
    the distressed will really be very appearent, especially on the stock I have in
    mind &#40;a soft uncaoted cotton&#41;<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Well not too small.. most likely 1.5 to 2 inches in width. Which in my mind
    makes the &#39;roughness&#39; a little less prominent. <BR> <BR>Ill try a few
    sketches with the Om symbol. interesting idea.

    I think it contributes to the natural, earthly, human nature of holistic treatments
    &#40;or training in this case&#41;. It&#39;s looking good. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

    mark. <BR>Im working on a &#39;crown&#39; type symbol, that will sit atop the
    head of the &#39;M&#39;. I will post when I have a digital version.

  body: '&#34;For sake of clarification, it is &#39;personal training&#39; -- not
    yoga.&#34; <BR> <BR>Just MHO, of course, but the mark clearly says &#39;yoga&#39;
    to me...most likely because every single yoga ID I&#39;ve seen seems to lock on
    to the chinese calligraphy as a theme. Not that that makes it a bad mark, just
    that you may have some trouble completely detaching it from yoga.'
