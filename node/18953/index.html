<p>When i try to manually rag, the rythmn is a real mess. I&rsquo;ve tried tracking +-20. Is there a visual limit to how far you can track before it becomes really noticeable? Perhaps there&rsquo;s a rule, perhaps it&rsquo;s by individual font.</p>

<p>Some will say there&rsquo;s a rule, i&rsquo;m sure, but can you use a hyphen when ragging?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what computer program you are using to do your typesetting, but usually tracking is not a good idea for this. Depending on the program you are using, there are other options.</p>
<p>As for your question about using hyphens, it depends on whether you want a tight or loose rag. Some people are okay with hyphens, some aren&rsquo;t. Even when you do allow hyphenation, there is a limit to how many hyphenated lines in a row look good (i.e., pleasing to the eye).</p>
<p>I recommend getting a good book on typesetting &ndash; plenty out there, but here&rsquo;s three of them:</p>
<p>The Elements of Typographic Style, by Robert Bringhurst
The Thames and Hudson Manual of Typography, by Ruari McLean
Thinking with Type, by Ellen Lupton</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>I own the Elements of Typographic Style, actually. I&rsquo;ve tried to understand the chart but I can&rsquo;t actually put it into practice. I think it&rsquo;s a case of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make the chart pretty&rdquo; versus giving the reader a solid example of usage. Anyway, another day, perhaps.</p>
<p>is the column width a big factor when you&rsquo;re doing a rag? I know the right width is pretty important with force justified columns.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It also depends on the software you&rsquo;re using for layout. Quark is not as forgiving as InDesign is with the amount of tweaking. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s more accurate to say InDesign uses a different setting for autospacing and kerning. Some magazines have a standard that they will allow type to be kerned to; my experience is, in Quark don&rsquo;t go past -4 in body copy, and InDesign it seems that a -20/25 is the general threshold.</p>
<p>Some clients don&rsquo;t mind hyphens in their copy, some make you turn hyphenation off. In my old job, we did a lot of government work and we were not allowed to use hyphens especially in bilingual material, each translator wanted to break words at different parts so they put a kibosh on hyphenation.</p>
<p>You want to make sure you watch out for widows/orphans and it&rsquo;s ok to use line breaks to knock down a word to balance out the rag a bit more.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A trick I use - in Quark at least, I don&rsquo;t know Indy - is to work with H&amp;Js. I have three settings: tight, normal, and loose. Since H&amp;Js work more with word spacing than tracking it is usually less noticeable. Sometimes just changing from normal to tight can either fix a bad rag or pull up a widow. I also have a &ldquo;no hyphenation&rdquo; H&amp;J where that&rsquo;s required (some clients do specify that, but it can be problematic at times).</p>
<p>It is always OK to use a hard return to bring down a pesky word, such as a &ldquo;to&rdquo; that is hanging off an edge visually. But you need to be extra careful about those hard returns if the text is edited later on so you don&rsquo;t end up with short lines.</p>
<p>Also  you want to avoid creating &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; in the rag, unsightly bulges or indentations that are too smooth - a good rag will have a visual rhythm that doesn&rsquo;t attract attention to itself.</p>
<p>Re hyphens: preferably no more than 2 in a row, never more than 3. I try to avoid them in ragged text but sometimes it can&rsquo;t be helped. They should not stick out too far. Also set your H&amp;Js so that there is a minimum of 3 characters either before or after a hyphen.</p>
<p>For tracking I try not to go to more than -2 or +2 except in more forgiving fonts. But I always try to adjust the H&amp;J before I track.</p>

<p>Me too &ndash; this is what I meant earlier by &ldquo;Depending on the program you are using, there are other options.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is always OK to use a hard return to bring down a pesky word, such as a “to” that is hanging off an edge visually.

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it better to use a soft return for this? Hard returns can add space before or after a paragraph, if you happen to have a paragraph&rsquo;s style set up that way. You still have to be careful with later editing with soft returns, but they are more forgiving with things like formatting. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Another good trick in InDesign is the &ldquo;Nonbreaking Space&rdquo; (usually command-option-x); it looks like a word space but InDesign will treat the words on either side of it as one word. The nonbreaking space is better than a line break for killing widows, because if your type is ever re-flowed it won&rsquo;t create havoc.</p>
<p>In terms of bringing up lines, I&rsquo;d say to kern wordspaces first, even to -80 (indd units, not quark) depending on the characters around them, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apply tracking, usually not more than -5 (again, indd units). It sounds like Patty&rsquo;s method with H&amp;Js is a smarter, more automated way of applying this idea&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Word Spacing in H&amp;J is the key. My default setting in Illustrator and InDesign is: 
Minimum: 65%
Desired: 85%
Maximum: 100%</p>
<p>And I adjust it from there, usually lower, sometimes to 50/60/70. Better too close than too far apart. Always hyphenating if I can get away with it. Never adjust letterspacing, unless there is a visible kerning problem. An even rag obviously works better with space-saving fonts like Adobe Garamond or Minion. Tweak out the edge of the textblock a little too, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t make a noticeable difference but fixes the rag. I also switch between the Adobe Single-Line Composer and Every-Line Composer in the CS programs, sometimes one works better than the other.</p>
<p>Another trick I have used is to set the spaces between sentences in a different character style which has a different horizontal scaling than the rest of the paragraph. Then you can adjust the spaces all at once. This is a real pain to use, so I would recommend it only for situations that call for a paragraph of perfect type in a large size, where the character count is much shorter than normally desired.</p>

I have read my way through many books, and &ldquo;more than three&rdquo; hyphens have never bothered me, never hindered my reading or comprehension. It seems to be an easy target for people looking at typesetting to comment on.</p>
<p>If you have pretty tight copy that is near the final edit, you can do many things. I always try my darndest to honour consistent word &amp; letterspacing. However, to re-jig paragraphs to eliminate widows (another bunk style issue) I will adjust tracking +5 to -5 (InDesign). My word spacing settings differ depending on context, but I try to limit it to about 20% from minimum to maximum. As others have also admitted to, I will also allow minute horizontal scaling, depending on the typeface  (totally un-noticeable if done properly). Another neat little trick is to subtlely adjust the width of your text boxes. This does absolute wonders for errant bits &amp; bobs that need adjusting. This is also un-noticeable if done properly.</p>
<p>It all seems like a pain in the ass for people demanding justified text, but necessary to keep clients happy. Have fun!</p>
