    probably&#41; the argument used today by designers who know about trapping, and
    think there&#39;s an advantage to incorporating them, but don&#39;t actually do
    it simply because it&#39;s too much work doing it right - the benefit is admittedly
    secondary. I can accept that - making money in type design is hard enough without
    such idealism. And in fact there are certainly some wonderful fonts out there
    &#40;past and present&#41; which don&#39;t have trapping but nonethless deserve
    to be classified very highly on the scale of text faces. But they&#39;re not on
    the pinnacle. <BR> <BR>And soon, saving effort will no longer be an excuse...  :-&#41;

    alt="composite.jpg"> <BR> <BR>The background is cropped from my metal scan from
    before, and overlaid on it is an actual print I&#39;ve made from Pascal 60. <BR>
    <BR>You can see: there&#39;s no gain; the bodies are not solid. <BR> <BR>I made
    that print &#40;on good paper&#41; because I wanted to repoduce the exact letterform
    outlines, for tracing - so I didn&#39;t care about having solid bodies. The point
    is, that&#39;s the only way I managed to avoid any gain &#40;and I only managed
    that because I had a master printer holding my hand through the process&#41;.
    If I had wanted to make the bodies solid as well as maintaining letterform fidelity,
    I&#39;d have had to be Gerald Lange myself. And there are very few of those. <BR>
    <BR>So in real printing such ideal results almost never happen, basically because
    a non-solid body looks worse &#40;to most people&#41; than fattened outlines,
    and most printers will go &#34;Huh?&#34; if you mention something about the type
    designer&#39;s intentions... Like I&#39;ve pointed out, even Bram de Does fattened
    Fleischmann&#39;s brisk foot serifs. Maybe he liked it that way, but it&#39;s
    anti-fidelity to the original. <BR> <BR>The tendency is to go over, not under.
    <BR>Note also that when you&#39;re setting up, removing ink is a major pain &#40;you
    have to start over&#41;, but adding is trivial. <BR> <BR>So there is generally
    too much ink and too much pressure, so there very much is gain. Not enough to
    justify the huge traps on the &#34;b&#34; &#40;considering the large point size&#41;,
    but enough to justify the ones on the &#34;d&#34; for example. That &#34;b&#34;
    is in fact an exception in the overall font. Which makes me wonder, maybe the
    person putting in the traps &#40;which would most probably not have been Mendoza
    y Almeida&#41; was going alphabetically, overdid the &#34;b&#34; &#40;and fixing
    it was decided against, since they might have had to make a new matrix&#41;, but
    then got it right for all the rest. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>As for your point about
    Fleischmann&#39;s huge shears being a design decision, I can&#39;t deny that&#39;s
    a <i>partial</i> possibility &#40;unlike people who apparently can deny that gain
    not only exists, but is the norm&#41;, but in the case of Yellow, I can be sure
    it was gain compensation, because I asked the guy. And why would Fleischmann not
    have followed the same mental path towards that design feature? I&#39;d guess
    that contemporary phone book printing is comparable in gain to newspaper printing
    250 years ago &#40;and that&#39;s what that Fleischmann 8 point was made for&#41;.

    the matrix - that would be easy to redo&#41; for the b. If trapping were to be
    a finishing process then perhaps the b was thought wrong and a different procedure
    was applied to subsequent letterforms but they may not have gone back to the b
    and redone it. Guessing as well. Bit of an oddity. <BR> <BR>In _Counterpunch_
    there is some discussion about the procedure for small text sizes that may have
    some relevance to Fleischmann. Small text sizes were not initially used in early
    printing as I recall and when introduced there was some concern about their legibility.
    I think that&#39;s in _Counterpunch_.

    the late 17th century into the mid twentieth.  <BR> <BR>Combinations of tissue
    paper, papier mache, even plaster of Paris would be used to create a mould from

    This casting would then be locked onto the printing cylinder. <BR> <BR>But I doubt,
    that trapping would have been a consideration. While a secondary reproduction,

    peas <BR> <BR>When the elephant comes to take a pea <BR>Kick him in the ash hole'

    I vote you five stars on that one. <BR> <BR>The &#34;Caslon Challenge&#34; ended

  body: John, the great thing about non-physical discussion groups is that it&#39;s
    so much easier to ignore frothing streakers. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, the quality
    of the discussion still depends on the aggregate of individual participation.
    <BR> <BR>Palatino trapping coming up... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'OK, here&#39;s a scan of the &#34;Qu&#34; logotype from Palatino 42, 30,
    18, 12 and 8 point. <BR>I really need a 1200 dpi &#40;optical&#41; scanner...
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12430.jpg" alt="palatino.jpg">
    <BR> <BR>The trapping in Palatino is much sparser and much lighter than in Pascal...
    but it&#39;s there: look at where the tail of the &#34;Q&#34; joins the body.
    It&#39;s barely visible overall, but pretty obvious in the 12. <BR> <BR>Notes:
    <BR>1&#41; This cut of Palatino doesn&#39;t have the pronounced optical scaling
    that I&#39;ve seen in other Palatinos. This might mean that better Palatinos &#40;?&#41;
    have better trapping &#40;since both of those things are technical refinements&#41;.
    <BR>2&#41; I&#39;ve made sure the JPEG lossiness hasn&#39;t ditorted the traps.

  body: Actually, I almost did that a few days ago. Not just for karma, but for &#34;protocol&#34;
    as well. <BR> <BR>But the reason I&#39;m wary of having a &#34;Trapping&#34; thread
    is that I&#39;m not ready to do the topic justice just yet. Of course, anybody
    else still can, and you&#39;d have to physically bind me to keep me off such a
    thread!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I took some measurements off that Palatino. <BR>1&#41; The baseline is higher
    in inverse proportion to point size. Strange. <BR>2&#41; The scale, spacing and
    weight generally increase in inverse proportion to point size. Good. But the 18
    is a direct scale of the 42 &#40;bad&#41;; and the 12 and 8 seem to be direct
    scales as well, but I&#39;m not sure. Also, the 30 seems to be an enlargement
    of the 42 &#40;a little bad&#41;. <BR>3&#41; The x-height/cap-height proportions
    seem constant. Bad. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, I will soon be dissecting ATF Garamond
    to extract its optical scaling - that should be much smarter. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    18&#41;. But just wait for the ATF Garamond! I&#39;ll be doing a waterfall of
    about 10 sizes, but it&#39;ll take me another 2-3 weeks. Seperate thread for that,
    definitely. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
