body: 'A trip to Versiontracker this morning pointed me to an update of Internet Explorer
  for Mac OS X.  This latest version, v5.2, includes support for the new Quartz text
  smoothing feature included in X 10.1.5.  <BR> <BR>Even as I type this message, all
  the type on my screen is smoothed. I&#39;m not sure I like it- the small type loses
  that crisp edge we&#39;ve grown accustomed to, and the aliasing makes the type appear
  as if in a lighter color. I have to ask myself: Is this really more legible? <BR>

  ALT="yahoo2"> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my two cents on where I think this might go:  <BR>
  <BR>Small type on the web, as we know it now, will become  a thing of the past,
  if anti-aliased type is to become the norm.  Designers will have to allow for larger
  type selections in their site designs, which could pose a problem if we remain prisoners
  to the 800x600 browser size. Isn&#39;t about time we start designing for 1024x768?'

  body: ' I will always be &#34;so print.&#34; The look of print is the ideal towards
    which screen graphics is trying to move. Why do you think all this anti-aliasing
    business is pursued in the first place? Say what you like about the quality, I
    see it slowly improving. But screen resolution is the best way to address this
    problem, beating anti-aliasing hands-down. And companies are investing in higher
    LCD resolution. IBM already has some 300dpi prototypes. And I haven&#39;t kept
    up with medical imaging technology either, which I bet is further along in the
    resolution game. <BR> <BR>Most book pages have a portrait aspect ratio. Notable
    exceptions like LetterLetter exist, but most print designers use portrait mode.
    The widely predicted End Of Print turned out to be a farce: the number of books
    being printed continues to grow. <BR> <BR>For designing fonts, most letters themselves
    have a portrait aspect ratio, so in portrait mode, you can get more detail in
    a maximized glyph window in FontLab. Try it sometime. <BR> <BR>But regardless,
    there are certainly situations where it&#39;s good to be able to use landscape
    mode as well, and the technology to rotate the screen is simple and cheap, so
    users should be given a choice. Apart from sites designed to work at 800pix wide
    or greater, I quite prefer my web browsing in portrait mode. '

  body: While it may be time to break the 800px rule, <BR>I find sites that _require_
    the full 1024  <BR>widths cumbersome. I think something in between  <BR>is better,
    like 900 or so. <BR> <BR>And, yes a vertical aspect ratio is nice.  <BR>However,
    there&#39;s something great about a truly  <BR>cinematic &#40;letter box&#41;
    aspect ratio when it  <BR>comes to motion graphics. I&#39;m personally  <BR>hoping
    the web goes more in this direction,  <BR>than in a static, print-centric direction.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve recently been re-inspired by the article  <BR>format at the International
    Herald Tribune site  <BR><A HREF="http://www.iht.com/articles/62077.html" TARGET="_blank">
    www.iht.com</A>. It uses set column widths and by <BR>putting multiple  columns

    approach to reading on screen.

  body: ' I think it&#39;s hard to anticipate what the schism between electronic and
    printed information is going to be, but it&#39;s certainly coming. Some things
    are always going to exist in print, some things will cease to exist in print.
    Dostoyevsky and TV Guide offer a nice juxtaposition, or Pat The Bunny and the
    OAG Frequent Flyer Airline Schedule. We take for granted that books and newspapers
    contain different kinds of information; their formats reflect this, as does their
    typography. Although I wholly agree with John&#39;s excellent and succinct comments
    above, I have to acknowledge that a folded The New York Times is long rather than
    tall. That said, The New York Times is just the kind of thing that&#39;s best
    served up on a monitor. <BR> <BR>Speaking as a focus group of one, very little
    of the information I gather online resembles what I&#39;m accustomed to on the
    printed page. I rarely read more than 250 consecutive words on screen, with the
    exception of e-mail, which arrives in windows that I stretch to fit the natural
    cadences of their content. The valuable information delivered over my monitor
    tends to be expressed in widely ranging proportions, just as the shape of a spreadsheet
    is determined by the data it contains. Travel itineraries seem to naturally flow
    vertically, product comparisons are generally horizontal. Neither of these kinds
    of information resembles John&#39;s book or Hrant&#39;s horizon, leading me to
    wonder if the Portrait v. Landscape debate might not be so relevant after all.
    <BR> <BR>If we&#39;re going to indulge in Things I&#39;d Like To See &#40;tm Mad
    Magazine&#41;, I&#39;ll vote for the 1200dpi digital paper in scroll format, which
    the user can unfurl as the situation dictates. Or the projection hologram, which
    sounds equally fun, and refreshingly non-rectangular. Until then, I&#39;ll use
    whatever Apple sees fit to manufacture. '
