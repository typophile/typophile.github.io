body: "I am laying out a perfect-bound booklet of 64pp + paperback covers, page size
  210mm high x 130mm wide. The spine width will be about 5mm, and each cover will
  be pre-creased vertically 4mm from the spine. When a reader opens the booklet for
  the first time those 2 x 4mm will remain out of sight; ordinary handling and page-turning
  will disclose almost all of the gutter.\r\n\r\nMy question is about margins. Because
  of this variable visible gutter I avoided making the two inner margins equal one
  outer one. I settled on margins of top 14mm, bottom 23mm and outer 20mm each. Will
  that work, given how much tolerance there will be in how the inner margins will
  appear to the reader? Do I need more white at the gutter to compensate?\r\n\r\n(It\u2019s
  continuous prose, no illustrations.) "

    the book: the more pages up, the greater the creep. Since the book will be perfect-bound,
    the inner margin should be measured on the innermost pages of the printed and
    folded signature. If your measurements work on these pages, you should be OK...'

  body: "I\u2019ve been design a perfect-bound magazine with similar measures and
    (I believe) 16 page signatures. Almost 12,5 mm is \"lost\" on each page in the
    spine. There are variables though. Thinner and softer paper might give other results,
    and the cover also effect this."

  body: "James (Dunwich) is on the right track. But in practice, <em>measuring</em>
    the loss is actually quite difficult.\r\n\r\nI suggest two possible approaches.\r\n\r\n1)
    Print out proofs of your design-in-progress and trim to size. Then set the page(s)
    into the dummy, snug up to the gutter. \r\n\r\nMeasure the amount left hanging
    out over the fore-edge. Trim this amount from the inside margin, and set the page(s)
    back into the dummy. (I like to use a bit of double-sided tape to hold the page
    against a dummy page, aligned to the fore-edge.)\r\n\r\nNow you\u2019ll really
    be able to tell how your design works, in three dimensions.\r\n\r\n2) Another
    approach is to take the dummy, open a center spread, and mark with a pencil where
    you think the inner margin should fall visually. Then measure in from the fore-edge
    and use that to determine the inner margin of your layouts.\r\n\r\nThen go through
    the exercise of #1 above to evaluate your design.\r\n\r\nA book printer can usually
    make up a dummy for you to the exact specs \u2014 trim, length, paper stock, and
    binding style. Might cost you a surcharge, depending on your account with the
    manufacturer, but worth it, imo.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Remember, with perfect binding, the signatures are trimmed on 4 sides. In
    the States, the gutter looses 1/8 of an inch. That's just gone. Then there is
    the \"tightness\" that perfect binding (or notch, for that matter) adds.\r\n\r\nEven
    with the creased spine, the glue itself will add some stiffness. I haven't had
    to worry about this for a while, and understand there are now better glues. Still
    . . .\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I misunderstand -- usually, you can't perfect bind as
    few as 64 pages. I'd take 96 pages as the minimum. With that in mind, Kent's suggestion
    of having the printer do a dummy makes good sense to me."
