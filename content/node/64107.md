  help us identify this wonderful typeface!\r\n\r\nWe think it could be a play on
  Donald Young's \"Young Finesse\" \r\n(http://doyaldyoung.com/113_YF_Roman/113_YF_Roman.html)\r\n\r\nBut
  there's been a few instances where we have seen this used elsewhere, can anyone
  out there enlighten us of whether this is an existing typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks heaps
  in advance,\r\n\r\nF//W"

    it's great to actually have this in digital format!\r\nAnyone up-to-date on where
    we should go for licensing for typefaces such as these: \r\nFoundry or designer?\r\n"

  body: "Indeed\u2026 \r\nWe did see the rules on his site, however there is a much
    large issue of licensing concerned here. \r\n\r\nMickey Rossi (aka subflux) is
    being very generous with the simple condition: send me a link to the work. Love
    it!\r\n\r\nHowever, since this is a digital replication of the original 'Stark
    Debonair' designed for press by VGC (Visual Graphics Corporation), who no longer
    exist as of the 80's, we are unsure as to whether we can legally use this font
    for a commercial magazine or branding project.\r\n\r\nThus two questions remain!\r\n\r\n1)
    Does anyone know of the current rights holders for the VGC's type library?\r\n2)
    Has anyone come across this 'digital replication' grey-area before?\r\n\r\nThanks
    in Advance,\r\n\r\nF//W"
