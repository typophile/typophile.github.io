  works fine, am I right?"

    two things about lookups:\r\n\r\n1) Once you define a lookup, you can use it somewhere
    else without repeating the same code. This is more efficient for you to code as
    well as making the final font smaller.\r\n\r\n2) Sometimes you need to make sure
    that different bits of code are executed in a specific order. Putting them in
    separate lookups can help with that.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    case, where exactly is the lookup \"kern0\" stated? I mean, where in the font
    is it written?\r\n\r\nIs it some list on the side, or are these lookup-names standardized

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nhave you read my explanations in the other thread? \r\n\r\nEach
    feature is associated with at least one lookup. If a feature is associated with
    just one lookup, then it is not necessary to explicitly use the \"lookup\" keyword
    in the AFDKO syntax -- this will be done implicitly. In other words, both examples
    that you listed have the exactly same result. \r\n\r\nAs Thomas said, defining
    lookups explicitly (using the \"lookup\" keyword) make sense mostly when you want
    to associate the same lookup with several features (in the AFDKO syntax, you use
    the \"lookup\" keyword to define the lookup once and the re-use it in a different
    feature), or if you want to associate several lookups with one feature (when you
    want to process the string of glyphs multiple times). \r\n\r\nThe lookup names
    in the AFDKO syntax are just for development purpose -- they are not being written
    into the font. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Adam, thanks for your patience. Yes, I did read your explanation, but still
    don\u2019t get it *LOL* Well, I think I sort of understand it but not completely.\r\n\r\nMay
    be that I\u2019m stupid, but it feels like I really need that someone answers
    my initial question, why is the \"kern0\" there in this specific case. I can\u2019t
    see that the lookup \"kern0\" should be used somewhere else in the font (it\u2019s
    only one kerning table, isnt it?)\r\n\r\nSo, why is that litte lookup there in
    this case, it\u2019s from Adobes Caslon 540 Std-font, which I openened and took
    a look at.\r\n\r\nIt doesnt make sense... (banging my head against the wall...)"

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nI'll repeat the most important point: Both examples that you
    listed have the exactly same result. This means that when you don't explicitly
    define a named lookup using the \"lookup\" keyword, the AFDKO library (i.e. FontLab
    Studio or the standalone AFDKO) will define one for you implicitly during compiling.
    In other words, if you don\u2019t write \"lookup kern0\", the library will write
    something like that for you, in the background. \r\n\r\nWhen you open an existing
    OpenType font in FontLab Studio, FLS will decompile the binary OpenType Layout
    tables into AFDKO syntax. It tries to do the best job it can to generate optimal
    AFDKO source code but sometimes it needs to be \"careful\". Theoretically, it
    should put the \"lookup\" keywords everywhere, in each single feature definition
    (because, as I said, the lookups *are there*). However, since the AFDKO syntax
    allows you to omit the lookup keyword if there is only one lookup defined, the
    decompilation process tries to remove the \"unnecessary\" lookup keywords. But
    it some cases, it leaves them in -- for different reasons. \r\n\r\nOne important
    thing to remember is that the AFDKO source code decompiled by FLS5 will never
    match the source code written by hand. It will always be somewhat imperfect. Sometimes,
    it does even happen that you decompile a font and then cannot compile it again
    -- this has to do with the fact that the AFDKO syntax in older versions of the
    library was not able to express all constructs properly. In AFDKO 2, some improvements
    were made but FLS5 still uses AFDKO 1.6. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nAdam"
