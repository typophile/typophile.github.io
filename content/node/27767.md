  Flash 8, see that it destroy the curve and make it a  little bit \u201Cshaky\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe
  S to the right is in my opinon much smoother, and also correspond to what I tried
  to achieve when drawing the curves. This one to the right also shows how it looks
  when set in all my other applications.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_in_flash_4817.png]\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nNo
  I\u2019m wondering \u2014 is it because of me (bad curves), or is it just a fact
  that Flash can corrupt letters like this?\r\n\r\nThis is how the points are set
  in FOG.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_the_curve_3611.png]\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  tried different anti-aliasing methods in Flash aswell."

  body: As far as I know Flash tends to do "de-smoothen" curves. I read about a similar
    problem in another thread just a couple of days ago. But I can't tell you how
    to fix this (or if there even is a solution for that matter).

  body: "<cite> Did you try out different rendering-qualities?\r\n\r\n\u2014 This
    was actually happening as soon as I typed a letter in Flash, before exporting
    it. But yes, I also exported it with best quality etc.\r\n\r\n<cite> As far as
    I know Flash tends to do \u201Cde-smoothen\u201D curves.\r\n\r\n\u2014 I see,
    sounds terrible that a program like Flash should destroy our type."

  body: illsans is correct, it doesn't 'de-smooth' per say...it's more of a 'simplification'
    when it's exported to a SWF. Minimizes file size I think, but yes it's too bad.

  body: Flash only handles quadratic beziers. When exporting those cubic beziers are
    approximated with quadratic ones.
