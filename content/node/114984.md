  or not...I'm new to fonts and unsure if this forum is focused purely on the world
  of print, or also includes digital fonts :-)\r\n\r\nThe question - are there any
  available True-Type Font files that actually include glyphs for the control picture
  range, specifically SOH-STX-ETX... type of control codes to display when those codes
  are used (vs some of the standard ones I see are smiley, hearts, and upside-down
  'L').\r\n\r\nA stackoverflow post referenced this document which is indeed what
  I'm looking for: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2400.pdf\r\n\r\nyou are open
  to flog me if I'm in the wrong area, otherwise I may need some hand-holding if I
  must 'craft' my own font file if none exist :-)\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n-Darren"

  body: Does your software allow these characters to be inserted as such? There are
    lots of these symbols in Apple Symbols, for example, but they have been moved
    to more easily accessable positions.
