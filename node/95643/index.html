To cvasil@supremecourt.gov
Sir,

As a party to a potential lawsuit involving actual monetary loss and irreparable damage to my 

personal and professional reputation, I leave it to your discretion to advise me of my best course 

of action as outlined here—

http:/  /www.supremecourt.gov  /ctrules/  tocounsel_07rulesrevisions  .aspx

Note: two additional single spaces have been placed between otherwise contiguous elements in order 

intentionally to avoid algorithmic misinterpretation of the contents of this message.

My dilemma: I have a potential lawsuit form monetary damages, which makes me an interested party. 

The potential plaintiff, curiously, controls the most extensive inventory of Supreme-Court-approved 

typefaces. Therefore, there are no disinterested parties to this suit, and therefore the majority 

of the parties involved—defendant, plaintiff, nor the Supreme Court itself—have an enormous 

disincentive to comply with the amicus curiae provisions of this ruling—unless, of course, the 

meaning of the term "certain" is certainly, indisputably and indubitably unambiguous when said 

brief is filed.

For reasons which should be painfully obvious by now, should the highest court in the land become a 

party to this hypothetical suit, who is duly authorized to disambiguate.

Yours in confusion,

Communications through the most secure channels highly recommended.

Here ends the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth of the email first referenced above.

Given by my hand, and entrusted to my soon-to-be-former colleagues and assigns, so that they may 

bear witness to the veracity of all of my forgoing words.

Also, other than competitive fairness, is there any reason why a typeface can't have the same name as another typeface, even if they look nothing alike?</div>
