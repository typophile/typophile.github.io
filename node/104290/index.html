  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The problem:
I want sequence of U+0435 (CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IE, name &ldquo;uni0435&rdquo;) and U+00A8 (name &ldquo;dieresis&rdquo;) chars to be substituted by U+0451 (CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IO, name &ldquo;uni0451&rdquo;) char.
I want sequence of U+F0987 (Supplementary Private Use Area, name &ldquo;uF0987&rdquo;) and U+100987 (Supplementary Private Use Area, name &ldquo;u100987&rdquo;) chars to be substituted by &ldquo;myglyph1&rdquo; glyph (&ldquo;myglyph1&rdquo; has no Unicode position).
I want sequence of U+F0986 (Supplementary Private Use Area, name &ldquo;uF0986&rdquo;) and U+100986 (Supplementary Private Use Area, name &ldquo;u100986&rdquo;) chars to be substituted by &ldquo;myglyph2&rdquo; glyph (&ldquo;myglyph2&rdquo; has no Unicode position).
I want sequence of &ldquo;uni0451&rdquo;, &ldquo;myglyph1&rdquo; and &ldquo;myglyph2&rdquo; glyphs to be substituted by &ldquo;myglyph3&rdquo; glyph (&ldquo;myglyph3&rdquo; has no Unicode position).</p>
<p>So that if I have uni0435 + uni00A8 + uniF0987 + uni100987 + uniF0986 + uni100986 sequence, I want it all to be substituted by &ldquo;myglyph3&rdquo; glyph.</p>
<p>I thought about this kind of opentype code:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and MS VOLT lookup source:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and I tried to ship font using MS VOLT, but this compiled feature becomes unavailable in Chrome browser (Firefox is OK, I didn&rsquo;t test IE10). How can I solve the problem with Microsoft VOLT or FontLab?</p>

If it works without applying any explicit features in Firefox, but not in Chrome, then it sure sounds like Firefox is behaving correctly, and Chrome has a significant bug in not applying required features.</p>
<p>(On the side, &ldquo;substitute uni0435+dieresis by uni0451&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound quite right. The dieresis encoded at U+00A8 is not the combining dieresis, that would be U+0308.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I believe the dieresis at U+00A8 is what most of us think of as a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; dieresis. It originated back when only the first 127 characters of ASCII were fixed. In many 8-bit ASCII encodings, there was a dieresis at A8.</p>
<p>It should live on only for the proper reading of older texts, before Unicode. (Unless there is any need for a spacing modifier dieresis, as I don&rsquo;t believe Unicode has one.) Any new use as a  combining diacritical should be U+0308.</p>
<p>Having said that, most font designer&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t bother with including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the combining diacritics, which makes their fonts not proper Unicode.</p>

<p>U+E000..U+F8FF (though some of these have been used for Variation Selectors and other oddities)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Concerning the original question, I suggest having a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Opentype features in web browsers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Gustavo Ferreira on typotheque. There is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->series of tests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and in particular for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->liga<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, standard ligatures. Unfortunately, the syntax varies from browser to browser. I managed to get the ligatures working with Chrome on Mac OS X 10.8 (with a webkit font) with the following settings (a list copied from the site so as to cover most browsers and situations)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and Chrome even accepted those weird ligatures I imagined as some kind of test after reading the initial post:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The font was made with FontForge (with the graphic interface) and the above feature file is the output from FontForge (and such a feature file can also be used in FontForge with Merge feature file; I prefer using feature files for contextual ligatures and alternates but for liga, the graphic interface works comfortably). As a conclusion, ligatures are not automatic, and also Chrome does not reject disallowed input (I am not sure I like that).</p>
<p>All that being said, I must confess I am also puzzled by the original post. Concerning the letter uni0451, it is normally obtained using a keyboard by first typing a key corresponding to dieresis, and then the key corresponding to uni0435; the final effect is that a single character is entered into the text, and it is uni0451. There is no need of a feature file for that, the keyboard layout sends the right character, uni0451, to the text editor. Everything works fine as long as those three characters are in the font (and you have the appropriate keyboard).</p>

<p>I agree it&rsquo;s &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; (&ldquo;not the sharpest knife in the drawer&rdquo; is gentler, maybe?), but I&rsquo;ll stick with it not being proper Unicode, for the following reason. Remember, the consortium put their foot down on assigning any more codepoints to accented characters. IIRC, at that time, they allowed they&rsquo;d never intended to give so many accented characters codepoints anyway, such characters were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->suppose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be constructed using base characters and combining diacritics.</p>

<p>Yes, in Unicode the &ldquo;Private Use Areas&rdquo; are special zones for people to use the character codes for basically whatever they want. Apps are generally expected to be able to handle and process PUA characters. They are not unusual in the field—particularly the first Private Use Area in the Basic Multilingual Plane has been used pretty extensively&hellip;.</p>
