    when the cd player door opens. in high school when i signed year books with ff
    i meant fugazi forever. well, not really, but you get the point. also, i just
    got the decline ep by nofx. brilliant work from a bunch of lazy slobs. in my printing
    practicum class we listened to whole bunch of music that my mother would be shocked
    to know i was listening to, like tomahawk &#40;completely out of hand&#41;, a
    little band from suburban chicago called big&#39;un, another out of control band
    called new brutalism, and this wicked cool canadian band called shotmaker. i still
    have a headache from it &#40;it had to be loud to be heard over the a.b. dick&#41;.
    probably no one cares about this old string anymore, but there you have it anyway. '

    change this much, or if Stuart wanted to try something new... or maybe Trevor
    Horn did have a big influence as producer. <BR>The sound is much more polished,
    a far cry from the signature B&amp;S lo-fi-ish sound, and I&#39;m not sure about
    some of the lyrics: &#34;I&#39;m sorry if he hit you with a full can of coke,

  body: "Mosh,\r\n\r\nI understand why you wouldn't want to label Siousxie and the
    Banshees/Creatures and being Goth, however they did have serious impact on the
    scene itself. I was involved in the Goth/Industrial scene for sometime throughout
    the 90's and they were at the forefront of what was happening musically. (I remember
    some of my friends used to cry when Siousxie would come on stage. :) ) Robert
    Smith once said that he and Siousxie never intended for people to categorize them
    in this manner, they don't consider themselves a part of any scene or genre \u2013
    but they are flattered all the same.\r\n\r\nI am not that familiar with the goth
    scene anymore (I still stick to the oldies) but it seems that this genre has morphed
    itself into contemporary \"alternative\" hard rock/punk. I can't give any examples
    as I avoid these records like the plague. I truly believe the goth scene died
    mid-nineties. Though, Peter Murphy is on tour again, I will be seeing him next
    week in Portland and I CANNOT wait. :)\r\n\r\nInterpol, great band, and yes, obviously
    influenced by Joy Division, another one of my favorites. No matter how awful some
    may perceive Ian Curtis' voice to be, I still hear sweetness in songs like \"Atmosphere.\"
    I highly recommend picking up some JD on vinyl \u2013 there is a quality to the
    music that is lost in other mediums. Early New Order did quite well with carrying
    on the Warsaw/Joy Division sound, but as soon as they went into mainstream discos,
    there wasn't much left for me to really enjoy. \r\n\r\nAnyone ever hear New Order's
    Video 5-8-6? (intense, bass driven, 28 minute track)"

    or five years ago. Marvellous. The place where they played in was closed the day
    after because it was in a very ruined and dangerous state and was not designed
    to hold so many people. :) Nobody died the day of the concert, though.\r\n\r\nI
    was a big Cure fan for maybe ten years, but I think the \"good\" Cure's final
    record was Disintegration. Others might disagree. The old material is powerful
    as ever to me. Same with the Banshees' catalogue.\r\n\r\nJoe & Tiffany: I find
    that P.Murphy has gone a little bland also,  but he's still got it. Sting? Yes,
    perhaps too much yoga AND wanting to appeal to 16-year olds with mellow ditties.
    Bowie's secret?: Get yourself accompanied by young, innovative musicians. His
    Outside CD was really great and well... chamaleonic."

    never equalled Bela Lugosi's Dead for me, although they did give a good performance.
    I wouldn't categorise Siousxie Sioux as goth, mainly because of their obvious
    punk roots (not that I really approve of trying to pigeonhole artists), I did
    see her in the audience at a Nick Cave gig promoting Murder Ballads at which Kylie

    to experimental for that label and the Banshees too pop.\r\n\r\nThat said, at
    the moment I'm pretty straightforward into retro80s THE-Bands. Athelete, Engineers,
    Arcade Fire, Snow Patrol, The Faint, Te Doves... stuff like that. \r\n\r\nThe
    new Porcupine Tree album is fairly good, although not as breathtaking as the last
    three outings. \r\n\r\nJem is surprisingly good pop. \r\n\r\nThe new Mars Volta
    is pretty much the same as the last album, there is no other band like that, at
    the moment. \r\n\r\nThere's some good German bands at the moment, Bosse, Tomte,
    Niels Frevert, Kettcar. \r\n\r\nThe new New Order is, alas, boring as hell. I
    think I should just buy the Saville-covers and leave the actual CD in the stores.
    Same goies for the new Tori Amos CD, very been-there-done-that, but with the addition
    that not even the coverdesign is pleasant. \r\n\r\nThe Tord Gustavsen Trio (on
    the great ECM label) is wonderful stuff, great Jazz. \r\n\r\nThese days, thanks
    to iTunes, my listening habits have changed a bt. Where formerly any new CD would
    run for a few days in the studios CD-Player, now a new-bought album will get MP3-d
    pronto and put into the maelstrom of thousands of tracks played at random in itunes,
    so here in the studio AC/DC is followed by Schubert, Chet Baker by Slime. It makes
    for pretty weird surprises, but I haven't digitalized my whole CD-collection yet.
    As I have an ipod in my car now as well, the same principle applies there. As
    a result, my listening habits have a bit... fractalized, strangely enough. \r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to Roisin Murphys first solo-album \xABRuby Blue\xBB, shame about Moloko,
    though. ro is a great singer and Herbert should guarantee a nice soundtrack...
    but Moloko was one of the best pop bands these recent years, along with Lamb,
    who seem to be vanishing as well.\r\n\r\nHD Schellnack"

    was a great loss when my son left home and took all his CDs with him, several
    of which I had become quite attached to (I missed the boy too). The other day
    I felt like a bit of Schnittke, in particular the Kronos recording of the String
    Quartets (great sleeve design BTW, featuring Alias' Granite face), but it was
    gone with Eric. So I went down to the local classical store to see if I could
    get a copy, but they didn't have one. Desparate for a Schnittke fix, I bought
    \"Oleg Kagan plays Schnittke\". Really enjoying Concerto No. 3 for Violin.\r\n\r\nAlways
    liked Peggy Lee but never heard her early work with Benny Goodman. My dad has
    a compilation album in his car, which he's lent me while he's on vacation, so
    I popped it on, and was gobsmacked -- she sounded so different then, and even
    more world-weary. "

    Saw them recently and they're great. My new favourite band is The Magic Numbers,
    they're also great live. Other than that, Royksopp are great as background electronica.
    Not feeling the latest Coldplay album quite yet, though. James Blunt's also getting
    a lot of airplay in our house due to my girlfriend - and REM (they played Nottingham
    last week and were superb). Oh, I mustn't leave out Athlete who are well worth

    recognizable stuff from Kasabian, Autolux, Aphex Twin, to keep it at least a tad
    familiar. Very highly recommended! (Isn't it rare to find a podcast you can actually

    Ottawa, ON. Definatly shouldn't have done that. This album lifted me up, and made

    A friend of mine always takes this CD with him when he goes speaker shopping:
    it's a great test piece, and always frightens the sales guys. You can hear a WMA
    sample <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/music/wma-pop-up/B000002S5H001002/ref=mu_sam_wma_001_002/002-7078945-0505624\">here</a>

    performances, of course -- is that they almost always want to give the impression
    of value for money, which means that there is usually two or more pieces on the
    programme, depending on the overall length. And not only am I usually only interested
    in hearing one of the pieces, but that's usually all I can manage if I'm going
    to really pay attention to the music. It's tiring to really listen to something!

    they have to more or less play by the rules and pay me my royalties.\r\n\r\nYoung
    bands get taken advantage of a lot. The first single from one of my bands was
    put out by an \"indie\". I have never received one penny even though I wrote both
    of the songs and played guitar. The person running the indie has declared bankruptcy
    several times over. Ironically one of the songs from that single was covered by
    the Red Hot Chili Peppers, resulting in a really good last couple of years royalty
    wise. Even more ironic is that I have never listened to their version of the song.\r\n\r\nSo

    for keeping the spoken intro in \"White Christmas\". \r\n\r\nAlso kinda kitschy:\r\nA
    Liberace Christmas--As good an excuse as any for Lee to use the top octave!\r\nDoris
    Day: Here Comes Santa Claus --makes me feel like a five-year old in a world with
    no cares.\r\nGene Autry: He'll be Coming Down the Chimney--\"Yes by Gosh by Jimminy,
    he'll be coming down the chimney\", a lyrical gem, and love the sound effects!\r\n\r\nOn
    the serious side:\r\nA Festival of Lessons and Carols as Sung on Christmas Eve
    in Kings College Chapel Cambridge (1954)--Awesome old-school aristocratic accent
    of Sir John Sheppard, reading the lessons, and the schoolboy choristers are quite
    angelic.\r\n\r\nMusic for the Feast of Christmas (Ely Cathedral, c.1960)--A lot
    of really old tunes, 15th-17th century, with, for some reason, Messaien's \"Les

    him at all. \r\n\r\nI hear you on the annoying qualities of Portishead, I don't
    listen much to them anymore. But in several ways, the \"Dummy\" album had a (quite
    unexpected) life-changing effect on me back in the mid-nineties, and that's worth
    a lot. \r\n\r\nDo you know My Bloody Valentine? I missed them back then (as everyone

    say they're the only truly innovative band of the nineties. \r\n\r\n"

    full experience of sensory deprivation, but there are some pieces of music I would
    really like to listen to while all my other senses were minimally stimulated.
    Thomas Tallis' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMz7ufLN-L4\"><em>Spem
    in alium</em></a> would be top of the list. The depth and complexity of the 40-part
    polyphony is so demanding and begs to be allowed to overwhelm all other senses:
    even closing my eyes immediately and completely changes the experience of the
    music, so I can imagine how doing away with awareness of my chair, etc. would
    probably intensify it even more."

    and Brita Koivunen on your list. Have they ever recorded in English? Or do just
    enjoy the beautiful sound of Finnish?</cite>\r\nActually, at least some of them
    have recorded a few items in English.\r\nThe reason I had even heard of them is
    because, since YouTube has reached an agreement with the music companies, I had
    been searching YouTube to listen to interesting items there.\r\n\r\nSo, first
    I searched for versions of Lesley Gore's hit song \"You Don't Own Me\" sung in
    other languages. In this way, I discovered Dalida, who sang the Italian version,
    \"Va Tu Sei Libero\".\r\nThen I looked at some of her other songs, and found that
    she sang the novelty song \"Itsy-Bitsy Teenie-Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\"
    in a French version, \"Un Tout Petit Bikini\". I then went searching to discover
    how many other languages this song had turned up in.\r\n\r\nAt least this is one
    version of the story. Also, in searching for other versions of songs that Nana
    Mouskouri had sung, particularly her early material written by Manos Hadjidakis,
    I found one song by Hadjidakis that apparently she had not recorded. (Actually,
    she had done so, but only in a French version: \"C'est Joli la Mer\".)\r\n\r\nI
    had not remembered that Brenda Lee's hit song, \"All Alone Am I\" was a modified
    version (an instrumental bridge became the chorus/refrain, the chorus/refrain
    became the ordinary part of the song, the ordinary part of the song was dropped)
    of one of Hadjidakis earliest songs, made famous in a movie about World War II.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    to the Greeks it is as strongly identified with Jenny Karezi and the movie, the
    way \"As Time Goes By\" is with Casablanca to English speakers, that Nana Mouskouri
    saw no need to sing \"Min Ton Rotas Ton Ourano\" in Greek. Later on, Anna Vissi
    would sing it.\r\n\r\nIn any event, my investigations into that song led me to
    other Greek artists, such as Vicky Leandros, and thus to the Eurovision Song Contest.
    So I might have encountered Dalida through that route instead of a search directly
    related to Lesley Gore.\r\n\r\nBrita Koivunen recorded, or at least performed,
    \"Ma, He's Making Eyes at Me\" in Finnish, but I recognized the tune, as \"Mamma,
    Tuo Mies Mua Tuijottaa\".\r\n\r\nLaila Kinnunen recorded a few songs in English,
    such as \"Girl Don't Come\", \"I Will Follow Him\", \"Who's Sorry Now\", \"Who's
    Sorry Now\", \"You've Lost that Loving Feeling\", and, in Finnish, she recorded
    \"Everybody Loves a Lover\" as \"Kell\xE4 Kulta Sill\xE4 Onni\".\r\n\r\nPirkko
    Mannola is the one who recorded \"Pikku Pikku Bikiniss\xE4\", which started me
    looking for other artists from Finland that turned up as related suggestions in
    her search results; she sang a duet with Brita Koivunen, and she also sang together
    with Laila Kinnunen and one other artist for a version of \"Three Coins in the
    Fountain\". Another rock and roll success in the English-speaking world she brought
    to Finland was \"Kumipallo\": \"Rubber Ball\".\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I found
    \"Det Finns Ingenting Att H\xE4mta\" in Swedish, sung by Anna-Lena L\xF6fgren,
    and \"Schuld War Nur der Bossa Nova\" in German, sung by Manuela, but I haven't
    found the Finnish version yet."

    Hatsune Miko, I found out about the Ievan Polkka. And clicking on related links
    led me to Kun Mun Kultani Tulisi.\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard it, I mistakenly thought
    it must have been a traditional Irish song translated into Finnish, but no, it
    is an old traditional Finnish song (or an old traditional Finnish poem set anew
    to music by Loituna; I am not yet certain which one)."

  body: "@Vilbel\r\n\r\nVletrmx21 is certainly a top Ae for me, why the <em>Garbage</em>
    EP finishes so well.\r\n\r\nIf you like a bit harder stuff with EBM influences,
    look into Trentem\xF8ller's <em>The Last Resort</em> (the double version). It's
    Haujobb + Autechre\u2014the glitch of Ae with the harder/darker beats of Haujobb.
    His other stuff doesn't hold up as well for me, but <em>TLR</em> has some great
    moments: <em>Polar Shift, Take Me Into Your Skin, Always Something Better,</em>
    and <em>Killer Kat (Bonus Track)</em>.\r\n\r\nHaujobb have been a favorite since
    the mid '90s, constant growth and progression from them. I like <em>Ninetynine</em>
    for its minimalism and detail, so the connection to Ae and the like is easy for
    me.\r\n\r\nHecq also does a fantastic remix of Metric from Haujobb's <em>Vertical
    Theory</em> (which is how I found Hecq in the first place).\r\n\r\nCircuitous
    as always."

  body: "Nick did you read the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n07/thomas-jones/so-ordinary-so-glamorous\">very
    interesting article</a> about Bowie's music in a recent issue of the London Review
    of Books? I found this bit particularly interesting, and it sent me back to listen
    to 'Starman' more closely:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Trynka doesn\u2019t often go into
    details about the music, which is perhaps just as well. In his discussion of \u2018Starman\u2019
    he talks about its \u2018opening minor chords\u2019 when they\u2019re nothing
    of the kind, and says that \u2018the key changes from minor to major\u2019 at
    the chorus. But there\u2019s no key change, and it\u2019s important that there
    isn\u2019t: the effect Trynka\u2019s hearing, the sense of \u2018release\u2019
    and \u2018climax\u2019 he gets when the chorus kicks in, would be lost if there
    were. What happens is that for the first time, the melody hits the tonic; Bowie
    gets through 15 bars in F major without singing an F, and then on the word \u2018starman\u2019
    he hits two of them, an octave apart. The octave leap is, as Trynka says, \u2018an
    ancient Tin Pan Alley songwriter\u2019s trick\u2019, and the steal doesn\u2019t
    stop there: the melody of the chorus is \u2018lifted openly, outrageously\u2019
    from Judy Garland. Bowie privately called the song \u2018Somewhere over the Rainbow\u2019,
    and before long was singing Yip Harburg\u2019s lyrics as well as Harold Arlen\u2019s
    tune in live performances of \u2018Starman\u2019.</blockquote>"

    struck me most about Ziggy was its conception of live performance. \r\nAt the
    time, you\u2019d go to a concert by the Who or Zeppelin and the set would be really
    long with a bunch of scruffy individuals wandering round the stage and jamming
    extended versions of their album tracks. The Dead at Glastonbury doing a 20 minute

    on a large empty stage, and they played the songs just like the record, 3 or 4

    some deeper sounds coming off his fret board. At times his musicianship reminds
    me of some of Mozart's stuff.  Between the common 4/4 beat phrasing structure
    he adds soooo much color!! Not that Mozart composed to the 4/4 beat ... but you
    know what I mean. They both have the ability to play within the space between
    the pedestrian musical structure(s).\r\n\r\nIn that guitar solo with Tom Petty

    helped Dave Van Ronk polish off a fifth of Jack Daniels backstage at a concert
    at Case Western Reserve University.\r\nHow the man could still make music after
    what we consumed was truly astounding. Played great, too.\r\n\r\nI've been listening
    to:\r\n\r\n<strong>Blues</strong>:  Tedeschi-Trucks Band (As a slide guitar player,
    Derek Trucks has no peer. The man can raise the dead. His solos have, at times,
    brought me to tears.) As a vocalist, Derek's wife Susan Tedeschi is a cross between
    Bonnie Raitt and Janis Joplin and an accomplished blues picker on guitar to boot.\r\n\r\n<strong>Theatre</strong>:
    <em>A Little Night Music</em> and <em>Sweeney Todd</em> - Stephen Sondheim, music
    and lyrics.  (Both librettos by Hugh Wheeler who, you can be sure, played a big
    part in supplying, uncredited, lyric ideas and song titles.) And with orchestrations
    by genius Jonathan Tunick - far and away the greatest orchestrator to ever work
    on Broadway.\r\n(My parents started taking me to Broadway shows from the age of
    eight, but even still, this stuff is definitely 'acquired taste'. But what a wonderful
    acquisition it's been. I can't live without listening to Night Music or Sweeney
    at least a couple of times a year. For the uninitiated, there's Tim Burton's treatment
    of Sweeney as a movie with Johnny Depp, just a few years back, where one can see
    a terrific movie and get the characters and story line so essential to appreciating
    the full theatre scores. Moreso than any other theatrical songwriter I can think
    of, Sondheim's music and lyrics only fully come to life when you understand the
    larger narrative within which the songs function. Few people know that the lyric
    to 'Send In The Clowns' isn't just some loose theatrical metaphors pieced together
    - they are very specific to a character in a very specific situation within a
    larger narrative.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Joni Mitchell</strong>:  Joni's 'jazz period'
    which to me, means everything she did that had Jaco Pastorius playing fretless
    electric bass behind her. The studio albums 'Hejira', (Jaco plays on four of the
    tracks), 'Mingus', 'Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'.  Also the live concert recording
    'Shadows and Light', where the band includes Randy Brecker on sax, Pat Metheny
    on electric guitar, keyboardist Lyle May, along with Jaco on bass. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    my son's been playing a lot of Irish folk music around the house lately - from
    Pandora via iPhone piped to speakers via bluetooth. Quite infectious."

    has now been blocked by YouTube. Remembering it prompted me, last night, to watch
    the London 'Concert for George'. I have to say that Eric Clapton's more restrained
    solo on 'While my guitar gently weeps' moved me more than Prince's. It's always
    breathtaking to see a virtuoso like Prince playing at the edge of control, but
    Clapton managed something that stayed relevant to the song itself. To make this,
    barely, relevant to type, it reminds me of the difference between being impressed
    by display typography that draws all sorts of attention to itself independent
    of the content, and that feeling one gets when typography just seems to perfectly
    fit the text.\r\n\r\nThe other highlight of the London concert was Anoushka Shankar
    conducting her father's composition while <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3bGvnx3ygg'>Clapton

    design, one of which was <em>WEDNESDAY MORNING 3AM</em> by Simon and Garfunkel.\r\n\r\nI
    had never heard of it, not surprisingly as I discovered (thanks to some googling),
    as it was their \uFB01rst album, released and ignored during the British Invasion
    of 1964. However, it was re-released a couple of years later, after their record
    company had added orchestration to <em>The Sound of Silence</em>, and that became
    a huge hit\u2014which I was familiar with.\r\n\r\nSo I went straight to that track,
    and yes indeed, the album I had was the \u201964, with the plain voice-and-guitar-only
    Sound of Silence. I had long known about how Columbia had jazzed up the song with
    strings and drums, but had never once heard the original, until yesterday. It\u2019s
    nice!\r\n\r\nA bonus is the awesome cover design, with its friggin\u2019 huge
    distressed stencil lettering (NOT a font!), and the Cinemascope shot of the boys
    in suits and ties on a subway platform. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/19a39e9e298eebb7ebb5d6d36ee7d0ac9ec6a765_5762.jpeg]"

    out with Summer Samba (So einen jungen Mann), followed by Island in the Sun (So
    meine Sonne scheint). However, I can not remember the name of the third song in
    the medley, from 0:48 to 1:33.\r\n\r\nI know that type ID requests do not belong
    in this forum, and thus, I suppose, song ID requests are even less so, but this
    is the only place music is discussed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It's Samba de Orfeu."

    and somehow I got the idea that there was a classic folk/protest song that sounded
    a lot like it - something on the order of Blowing in the Wind - that I had heard
    before.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't remember what it was. In trying to think of a similar
    song, I did come up  with a couple, one of which was:\r\n\r\nI Got You Babe by
    Sonny and Cher\r\n[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80QHRTQ3Kmw]]\r\n\r\nbut that's
    hardly it.\r\n\r\nI think the other possibility may have been Mary in the Morning,
    the big Al Martino hit from 'way back:\r\n[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i3mGqmIdTM]]"
