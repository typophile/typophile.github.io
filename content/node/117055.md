      is Not one of there fonts.  The said it was of roman style I searched the roman
      fonts and it it not there.\r\nThis is a copy of the email\r\nI already received
      your mail.\r\nBut our fonts are Thai fonts.\r\nAnd your sample is Roman characters.\r\n\r\nAlthough,
      we have Roman characters in our fonts, but not quite the same as your sample.\r\nVery
      sorry for this. "

  body: "Yes, all of their fonts had both Roman/Latin characters and Thai characters.\r\n\r\nDid
    you ask specifically about PSL Isara? That information would have been helpful
    as they have published so many fonts over time.\r\n\r\nIf they say it's not one
    of theirs, that's the best that can be done. It may have been removed from their
    active inventory.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry for this too.  Dick Pape\r\n"
