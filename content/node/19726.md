  anyone knows of a free font that would be a good substitute for 'Corporate A Light'
  by any chance - even if it means I would have to do a bit of stretching or something.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks and I hope to hear from you.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nMark"

  body: "no. not just a free font but a free font that looks like corporate a light.\r\n\r\nmaybe
    google will be a bit more helpful - in fact i'm sure of that! - more helpful than
    you certainly.\r\n\r\nwhy did you answer my post if you had nothing sensible to
    say or any ideas to help me out? nobody checks out topics that have a reply."

    'substitute' for a commercial typeface, on a board frequented by type designers?\r\n<em>(
    Needless to say that not many on here will be helpful in finding such a free version.

  body: "I have checked into that font, and discovered the reason it has the odd characteristic
    of working as a text font, but continuing to look good at larger sizes is a lot
    of detail went into it. Not sure what is meant by that, but maybe someone can
    elaborate.\r\n\r\nYou probably will have to settle for a seperate text and display
    font if you go the free route. For free stuff, Manfred Klein at the TypOasis is
    probably your best bet. Unfortunately there aren't samples, and there are thousands.
    I don't have time to go through it all, but feel free to check my  <a href=\"http://www.fontplay.com/mk.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Manfred site</a> for samples of some of my favorites."
