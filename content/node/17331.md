  the month whose apartment has just been infested with insects, and which now must
  be vacated for a few weeks. I'm planning on still making the trip, but am looking
  for an ersatz. Can anyone recommend a good place to stay?

    also.

    in quality between 'cheap' accomodation in London -- which is never actually cheap
    -- and moderately expensive is huge: much bigger than the difference in price.\r\n\r\nBeware
    of discount hotel booking websites. Find the direct contact information for a
    hotel, phone them and ask them what is the best price they can give you. Most
    hotels have promotional rates of various kinds that may not be listed on their
    websites. If you make it sound like you are shopping around, you can usually get
    a good deal. [This is true just about anywhere, by the way, not just London.]"

  body: "Well, I'll spend as much as I have to, but lower would be better\u2014even
    knowing London. When I booked the trip I hadn't planned on needing any overnight
    accomodation. Do you have any specific tips for me?"

  body: The last time I was in London, which now seems like ages ago, my wife and
    I stayed at a small hotel on Sussex Garden. It was clean, quiet, relatively inexpensive,
    and just around the corner from Paddington Station, so all the rest of London
    was convenient via the Tube. I don't remember the name, but a little Googling
    might bring them up.

  body: "This is the cheapest place I have stayed where I would even consider staying
    again:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.a1tourism.com/uk/ruskin1.html\r\n\r\nThis is where my
    family always stayed when I was a child. It is clean, which is the main thing
    you want. You do have to share a shower, though, and last time I stayed there
    the bed sagged badly. The best thing about the Ruskin is the location, which is
    in Bloomsbury, directly opposite the side of the British Museum, and in easy walking
    distance of lots of bookshops.\r\n\r\nNow when I go to London, I almost always
    stay at <a href=\"http://www.sarova.co.uk/sarova/hotelcollection/rembrandt/\">The
    Rembrandt,</a> which is more expensive but is directly across the street from
    Brompton Oratory."

  body: I've stayed at the <a href="http://www.euston-plaza-hotel.com/">Euston Plaza</a>
    several times and found it to be quite a value. I see by their website that it
    has been refurbished into a Hilton, so maybe their prices have gone up. But it
    is very close to the British Library and not far from Clerkenwell.

  body: Last time in london I stayed at the Best Western Phoenix hotel in Bayswater
    near Queensway. It was nothing special, but was less expensive (booked via internet),
    and reasonably convenient.
