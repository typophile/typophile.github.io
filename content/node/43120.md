  post ever. Anyway.\r\nHere's a sample of a book I'm doing for a graphic design history
  class, and was just wondering what you guys thought. I chose that format because
  there will be tons of illustrations throughout the book, and not much body copy.
  Is that a good proportion for the copy in relation to the page size?"

  body: "I think the gutter between the columns looks tight - as a result the two
    columns look jammed together in all that white space. Since you said this book
    is heavily illustrated it might be helpful to see how you intend to treat the
    pictures and captions as well.\r\n\r\nAnd a few design comments:\r\n\r\n1. Never
    start a column with the last line of a paragraph if you can avoid it.\r\n2. Your
    paragraph indent is a little small - barely perceptible. Also the first paragraph
    under a head is usually not indented.\r\n3. Try to align your columns if possible.\r\n4.
    I might adjust the proportion of your chapter title to your chapter number. As
    it is now, CHAPTER 2 stands out more than \"Alphabets\". It's less important.
    I'd try to reverse that emphasis.\r\n5. You have a mix of lining figs (in the
    text and main title) and osf (in the chapter number). I'd make those consistent
    - or spell out the numbers in the cn's. Also be consistent within the body of
    the text about how you refer to the chapter numbers.\r\n\r\nOK that's all for
    now."

    a head is usually not indented.</cite>\r\n\r\nUnless you also indent the head.
    But generally, a flush subhead is more serviceable; less true for chapter head,
    unless, as in your case, chapters don't start a fresh page.\r\n\r\n<cite>3. Try
    to align your columns if possible.</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd if you can't, one accepted
    conventing is that the inside columns are shorter, which would also solve the
    problem of not having the last line of the paragraph start a new column.\r\n\r\n<cite>4.
    I might adjust the proportion of your chapter title to your chapter number. As
    it is now, CHAPTER 2 stands out more than \u201CAlphabets\u201D. It\u2019s less
    important. I\u2019d try to reverse that emphasis.</cite>\r\n\r\nRight. Pure size
    is one way. Another way to lessen the impact of a larger element is to screen
    it. If, for example, you are using a large figure for the chapter number, and
    you want it to balance better with a smaller chapter title, you  might screen
    it. The same would apply to a drop cap. Not to say you should, it is just one
    more tool.\r\n\r\n<cite>5. You have a mix of lining figs (in the text and main
    title) and osf (in the chapter number). I\u2019d make those consistent - or spell
    out the numbers in the cn\u2019s. Also be consistent within the body of the text
    about how you refer to the chapter numbers.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes. Of course if you
    are using full-cap heads, I think it fine to mix old-style (aka *lowercase figures*)
    figures with lining (aka *uppercase figures*).\r\n\r\nFinally, though it can be
    hard to tell without seeing the images, I do feel your top margin is a little
    too generous, given the foot margin. It is still a book."

  body: This feels a lot more like a design for a low-budget history journal than
    a book about design history. Where are your images? Why are chapters starting
    in the middle of a column instead of ending with a flourish and starting in a
    new spread? Why does it look like something built around convoluted theories about
    Renaissance book proportion instead of a real book?

    When chapters are this short, starting each on a new page will be expensive, and
    result in a lot of wasted space. There is something just wrong about chapters
    that don't even fill a single page.\r\n\r\nThat said, a one column format with
    larger type might be the answer to both problems (why do young designers want
    to make everything so small? Don't they know that they will be looking out of
    50 year old eyes someday too?)\r\n\r\nI like most of the other suggestions, however."

  body: I was assuming that his chapters were run in like that because he hadn't placed
    the art yet. I could be wrong. But if the text is to run like this, I wouldn't
    give each section a simple head and remove the chapter number. I don't think I've
    ever seen a book where the chapter titles start in the middle of the page, and
    certainly not more than one.

  body: Hi. In your sample, I notice that you have a page number (folio) on the lefthand
    page, but none on the righthand page. Also, that one folio is kind of lost in
    the corner, not related in any way to the rest of the content on the page. You
    may want to try aligning the page numbers with one of the columns of text, or
    on the side margins. That way they will be easier to find, and might make the
    overall design stronger.

    start in the middle of the page, and certainly not more than one.</cite>\r\n \r\nIt
    happens, when you have, say, 25 chapters in 100 pages. When you go to a fresh
    page for a new chapter, you can figure on losing on average at least half a page
    between the combination of a chapter ending and a chapter beginning.\r\n\r\nI
    have seen more than one chapter on a spread, but as you say, never more than one
    on a page. If they fall that fast, I'd go to a single column text. But of course,
    art placement will change all that. I imagine that if there is that little text
    and that much art, chapters might as well begin on a fresh page. \r\n\r\nActually,
    I assumed we weren't being shown all the text. One other \"rule\" is that an image
    or table is placed within a section, i.e., usually before the next subhead, or
    in your case, before the next chapter. You could get yourself in a rather twisted
    position following that rule if the text is so short & you aren't beginning a
    new chapter on a new page."

    It's not something that I plan on producing or anything, just a simple project
    for my class. Although that doesn't mean I'm not trying to do a good job on it.\r\n\r\n>Why
    does it look like something built around convoluted theories about Renaissance
    book proportion instead of a real book?\r\n\r\nHaha. You caught me. I'm relatively
    new to typography and proportions is something I still don't very well understand.
    Which is one of the main reasons I came to you guys.\r\n\r\nSorry for confusing
    you guys, let me just give you a basic rundown of what I'm planning on doing and
    maybe you guys can suggest alternative methods.\r\n\r\nThese spreads will contain
    no images. The \"chapters\" can be better described as summaries. It will only
    introduce you to the core chapters, then the rest of the book layout (the ones
    that will contain images) are gonna be arranged differently. I wanted this to
    stand out from the rest of my book."

    chapter 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
