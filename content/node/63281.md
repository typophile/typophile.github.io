  on their website? I originally thought it was a stretched version of Bell Gothic
  but the K is different.\r\n\r\nSpecifically interested in the larger segment of
  text that reads RAIN JACKET\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rapha_3448.jpg]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks\r\n\r\n\r\nJamie"

    Just realized the lower case 'g' is a two story one instead of a single. Maybe
    not DIN?"
