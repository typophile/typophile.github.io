body: "Hello, again.\r\n\r\nI'm curious about the new Doctor Who title credits typeface.
  It's been suggested to me that the font used could be:\r\n\r\n* FF Din Condensed
  + Alien League\r\n* Univers Ultra Light Condensed\r\n* SF Movie Poster Condensed
  (I believe this is a fanmade version of Univers above, no?)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2r6czep_3749.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnywho,
  if someone can tell me exactly which one it is (or if it's different), I'd really
  appreciate it. Thanks."

  body: I think it's Univers Ultra Light Condensed (a.k.a. Univers 33), but it's been
    smeared or doubled to make it bolder in the first line.
