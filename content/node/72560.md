body: "By my count there are now three [[Hebrew]] fonts that are licensed with open
  source licenses:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=EzraSIL_Home|Ezra
  SIL]] font</li>\r\n<li>David Perry's [[http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html|Cardo]]
  (using SIL's Open Font License version 1.1)</li>\r\n<li>and the Culmus Project's
  [[http://culmus.sourceforge.net/ancient/index.html|Ancient Semitic Scripts]] family
  of fonts including Keter YG (using GPL v2 with the font exception clause).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe
  willingness of these projects to open source the development, modification, and
  adaptation of their fonts is, I think, both noteworthy and laudable. I would love
  to see [[http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx|SBL]]
  follow the lead of SIL in opening up their font, currently restricted to scholarly
  and educational use only.\r\n\r\nGiven the twenty year history (at least) of Hebrew
  font development, I'm concerned that there are some abandoned or orphaned Hebrew
  fonts. Some of these were made \"free\" prior to the formulation of any of the popular
  open source licenses (or GPL's font exception clause). Others were developed prior
  to Unicode 4+. Any contribution of these older fonts to the cultural commons would
  be a great boon for open source projects committed to providing freely licensed
  resources for wide adoption and adaptation.\r\n\r\nIf anyone here knows of some
  fonts that would be good targets for open source licensing, I'd like to hear from
  them.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nAharon Varady\r\nFounder & Director\r\nThe

  body: "<em>I would love to see SBL follow the lead of SIL in opening up their font,
    currently restricted to scholarly and educational use only.</em>\r\n\r\nThis isn't
    SBL's decision to make. The terms of the license agreement are part of a contract
    between SBL and Tiro Typeworks (me), and I retain the intellectual property rights
    to the SBL fonts. The SBL license can't be changed without re-negotiation of that
    contract. I'm not in principle opposed to open sourcing fonts, but I'm not in
    favour of just giving away things that I own.\r\n\r\nThe SBL Hebrew font isn't
    restricted to scholarly and educational use only, it is restricted to non-commercial
    use <em>by those who have not contributed to the cost of its development.</em>
    Anyone who wants to use the font in a commercial project or product can do so
    by becoming a member of the SBL Font Foundation or by making an appropriately
    sized contribution to the foundation. This funds further font development, and
    obviously SBL are interested in recouping some of their previous investment from
    commercial use of the fonts.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the Biblical
    Hebrew layout intelligence that is implemented in the SBL Hebrew OpenType Layout
    tables <em>is open source,</em> and is freely available to and usable by anyone
    who wants to incorporate it into their own Hebrew fonts. What's not open source
    is the particular typeface design embodied in the SBL Hebrew font. Ralph Hancock
    and I collaborated on the development of this layout intelligence, and we made
    it open source under the MIT license with the intention of encouraging the development
    of more Unicode and OpenType compliant fonts for Biblical Hebrew. We chose the
    MIT license because we didn't want to put any restriction on the use of that layout
    intelligence, but to give commercial, open source and free font development the
    same encouragement."

  body: "Thanks for the clarification. The language on SBL's [[http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/biblicalfonts.aspx|webpage]]
    is the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>Commercial uses of SBL Fonts</strong>\r\nSBL
    fonts are made available without cost to individual scholars for non-profit use.
    Commercial use requires the purchase of a license or membership is the SBL Font
    Foundation. Please download [[http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/SBLFontOrderForm.pdf|this
    form]] for information on obtaining a license to use the SBL Fonts for commercial
    purposes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere's a great deal of additional language in an
    End User License Agreement (EULA) in the manual for the font (Appendix A). The
    manual is a separate download from the font on [[http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx|this
    page]], so an end-user downloading the font wouldn't necessarily know what they
    had agreed to in using the font without having also downloading the license. I'd
    recommend that the manual or EULA be bundled with the font in a common zip.\r\n\r\nI
    realize this isn't SBL's forum, but I really like the idea of a non-profit font
    foundation funding the development of open source licensed fonts. Similarly, I'd
    like a foundation to help fund the development of an open source OCR engine like
    [[http://hocr.berlios.de|hOCR]] that can recognize different typefaces of Hebrew
    with or without nikkud. Perhaps if there is interest, SBL could take the lead
    or partner with another project on getting this going."

  body: The full EULA text is embedded in the font itself, and will be displayed in
    any font properties interface that exposes this information. I agree that putting
    the EULA as a text file in the zip download is a good idea, though.
