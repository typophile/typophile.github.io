  that he's trying to ID, but couldn't. I took a look and wasn't able to come up with
  anything off the top of my head, nor with my limited type books. So I go to the
  place I always go with these questions...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea what
  typeface is used for the outline/shadow numbers in this type sample?\r\nThanks in
  advance!"

    comes from? And was it published in England?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "From some Google searches, it seems this book was from 1872, and was published
    by A. S. Barnes, which seems to have been an American publisher (may still be).
    If that is the case, this should surely be a metal or wood type, and finding it
    as a font is unlikely. Since my best book on American Metal Type is for the Twentieth
    Century (McGrew), it is also unlikely to find it there -- I tried, and didn't
    see it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sorry - should have been more clear with my request. I just wanted the 1815.
    ID'ed.\r\nThank you for suggesting Torino however, it is pretty close.\r\n\r\nI
    do like that funky pre-cursor to Courier that they used for the word ADVOCATE,
    really interesting."
