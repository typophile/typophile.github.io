  figure out if a typeface is functional without having to do a handful of measuring?
  \r\nI am trying to create indoor wall signs for an upcoming apartment complex and
  the signs must be ADA approved. The typeface I would like to use is TheMix (caps),
  but again, there is no easy way to find out if it is useable or not without measuring
  out every letter."

  body: "I don't think there is a list of approved typefaces. Lightest weight requires
    at least a 1:10 stroke width to height ration. Boldest must be no heavier than
    1:5 stroke width to height ratio. There are also requirements for average letter
    width to height ratios as well.\r\n\r\nOur ClearviewADA was designed to meet these
    requirements:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=4\r\n\r\nJamesM"
