body: Hello! My name is Dante and I co-edit a screenmag called <a href="http://www.revolmag.com">Revol
  Magazine</a> and we are looking for type designers to feature in a future issue.
  We have already featured Eric Olsen from Process Type Foundry back in May, and we
  would like to feature another designer in our November Issue.  <BR> <BR>If you are
  interested, you can either post to this thread, or contact me directly at <a href="mailto:dzudzu@revolmag.com">dzudzu@revolmag.com</a>.
  I hope to hear from some of you soon! <BR> <BR>Dante
