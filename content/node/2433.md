  body: How rude of me - I always complain about lack of details  <BR>from Type ID
    posters, and then I go and give no info at all! <BR> <BR>This is from an ad made
    by a quickie print shop. We need <BR>to match the font. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s
    free, cheap, or a knockoff. <BR> <BR>So, Yves, I guess I don&#39;t have an excuse
    to buy Monoline. <BR>Damn.

  body: Yves, take most people in the world and ask them if they give a rats posterior
    weither an all cap head line matches something that was done even a week ago as
    long as it says discount or free. I think for this purpose horse shoes and hand
    grenades are close enough for Stephen.
