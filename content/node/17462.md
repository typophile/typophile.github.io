  the top \"represent\" the\r\n3 rooms/areas of the club. the color is just a working
  color. looking for critique right now :)\r\nthe club is going to play something
  like electronic music, dance and stuff for people between\r\n25 and 40 or so. thanks:

  body: "These are more squares than cubes. I love the logo below. Can't remember
    whose it is or was (maybe a bank??) - someone will know. Maybe it'll give you
    a little inspiration. Like the green, not keen on the shadow - seems a bit unnecessary
    from a purist point-of-view.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cubes.jpg]"

    body: "hi nick, i had some other version as well, but i skipped those because
      nearly all of them looked to \"technically\" (what the client dont wants). \r\nyou're
      right on the \"shadow\", but i kept it because it gives a little more \"contrast\". "
