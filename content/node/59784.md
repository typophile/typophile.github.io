  It all just seems bottom heavy. Argh! Also, The girl wants me to change the typeface
  to something more \"girly\". I made a list of other typefaces she can choose from
  but I really don't know what constitutes being \"girly\" without using an ugly,
  gimmicky font.\r\n\r\nI'd love any help you could give me, especially for the composition
  of the type in relation to the logo and number. Thanks so much!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    font is just blah. Very clean design. '

  body: Thanks but she's now asked me to use a cursive font. Bleah! And to move the
    doggie ears up. Trying my best to make her happy and still be proud to put this
    in my portfolio. Would love any critique on the placement of the rest of the copy.

    works. See, she made me use a script font, weh. I think the rr's interfere with
    the dog ears now, and it's not in one line anymore. Also had to change the numbers
    to match the name. It kind of looks like a spa now. What do you do when you have
    to change your work to an aesthetic that's not necessarily your preference? Do
    you revert back to your original idea when you put it in your portfolio or keep
    as is?\r\n\r\nAlso, I would love any critique you could give me regarding the
    type placement. Thanks very much!"

  body: "Actually, to me I think the font you've chosen works nicely - especially
    with the puppy ears. Before they looked stuck on and I wasn't sure what they were.
    I like that the stroke modulates from thick to thin, it has more of a drawing
    feel to it which compliments the hydrants, bones and paw prints on the back of
    the card. Since you find the r's distracting you may want to alter them slightly.
    The doggrrl.com seems close to the bottom, I would prefer to see the whole block
    of copy moved up just a bit.\r\n\r\nAs for using the final work or an earlier
    version in your portfolio, I'm a purest I suppose. To me part of the challenge
    of being a designer is working with the client. I do have a few self promotion
    pieces in my portfolio but they are unique to themselves and not a rejected proposal.
    I guess I'm concerned that in showing earlier versions of a project that I prefer
    over the final to a new client I'm saying (unintentionally) this client was an
    idiot and I may think you are an idiot too. So either it's in or it's out. I'm
    sure there are plenty of others who will argue the reverse, that's my 2\xA2."
