body: "Tobacco is based on some stuff I posted a long long time ago. Hrant gave me
  an advice there and now I want to implement it that I could use this font for a
  school project where I have to design some cigarette packages. Thats why I call
  it Tobacco. Some letters are not finish yet but I wanted to show it to you before
  I go to bed :)\r\n\r\nHere is the old thread with the old stuff. I think it looks
  completely different now.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/17284\r\n\r\nAnd then the
  new one:\r\n\r\nHope you like it\r\n\r\nSo, best wishes and good night: Steven\r\n\r\n"

    had character as well. Maybe you could add the 'M' of the previous version in
    the new one as an alternate or something? Same for the 'Q'.\r\nThe caps are quite
    small, or the ascenders of the lc quite short, I see that this is on purpose,
    but words starting with an initial caps look kinda odd in my opinion. Seperately
    it looks fine."

  body: "I like it too, especially for setting all capitals.\r\n\r\nIt's definately
    an improvement on the old version, but I agree with Quincunx in that some glyphs
    (particularly the M) from the old one would make good quirky alternates.\r\n\r\nI
    think I would like the U&lc more if the caps were just a little bigger. Maybe
    the same height as your i or t which I would also make the same height as each
    other.\r\n\r\nI think the tall ascender and short descender combination works
    well.\r\n\r\nThe W could be slightly wider. It's 'feet?' on the baseline seem
    a bit close together.\r\n\r\nA non grungy version would probably look good too.
    Maybe without the angled top edges that are on the E F H I L N T U V W and the
    top of the lc vertical stems, but then it may lose a lot of its character.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a work in progress, so I guess you havn't worked on the kerning yet, because that's
    a very lonely A :)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing it progress.\r\n"

  body: "This is quite charming I think. The finish on the letterforms is really nice.
    The only thing that strikes me as needing obvious correction are the dots on the
    \"i\" and \"j\": they're too low; maybe put their bottoms at the cap height. That
    and the blankspace is too big.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, make a much darker (and
    somewhat wider) weight too!\r\n\r\nBTW, consider calling it Tabac instead - classier,
    and sounds better.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    agree. It fits with the continental feel of the font.\r\n\r\nbabelfish.altavista.com
    says the German for Tobacco is Tabak. Even better?"

    bad problems with its main-storage and everytime I try to install my updated font
    the pc has a break-down. So I could not show you some updated work of \"Tabak\"
    until I fixed my computer.\r\n\r\nBye: Steven"
