body: "For those of us with wide or hi-res screens, Typophile's pages appear on the
  left side of the screen. Ergonomically (and aesthetically) it might be better to
  have the content appear centrally, rather than having to have the neck or screen
  turned all the time to one side. Here's what I mean, now and suggested:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile-Centred_3793.gif]\r\n\r\nDo
  any other users think that would be nice?"

    maximize button expands the window just to show all the content) than on Windows
    (where said button lock the window to take up all the screen).\r\nAnyway, seeing
    you use Firefox, if you want, I can conoct a quick & dirty user stylesheet that
    centers the content of Typophile."

  body: Please keep it decentered as it is, because in my opinion centered pages lower
    the readability. When the page is centered you have another contrasting area.

    why the sidebars were not moving to appropriate places \u2014 need the !important
    tag in there.\r\n\r\nHere's what I came up with for my 1680x1050 screen:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<code>@namespace
    url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n<code>@-moz-document domain(\"www.typophile.com\")
    {\r\n\r\n<code>html\r\n<code>\t{text-align: center;}\r\n<code>#wrapper\r\n<code>\t{text-align:
    left;\r\n<code>\tmargin: auto;}\r\n\r\n<code>#sidebar-right\r\n<code>        {position:absolute;\r\n<code>
    \       left:1340px!important;}\r\n\r\n<code>#sidebar-left\r\n<code>{position:absolute;\r\n<code>left:952px
    !important;}\r\n</code>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThat's my first time doing anything
    with CSS, (I didn't even know you could have user stylesheets) so this is probably
    quite poor/untidy. Sidebar-left takes care of the Prolific Posters and Wiki Recent
    Edits sidebars.\r\n"

    a back end system that isn't always the easiest thing to change. \r\n\r\nTypically,
    it's easier to start over from scratch rather than to 'clean up'.\r\n\r\n\"Can\u2019t

    not trying to sound smart or anything, but this really isn\u2019t that big a job.
    Obviously, some of the HTML might be generated by the back end system but the
    main structure probably isn\u2019t. Even so, if Typophile use PHP or ASP, the
    back end system typically does not generate the HTML \u2014\_it would rather loop/reuse
    snippets of code from the HTML files. What the biggest problem usually is with
    old systems is the mess of conflicting CSS styles that have accumulated over the
    years. "
