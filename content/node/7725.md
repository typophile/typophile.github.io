  body: Yeah, I saw that too. There are also a few similar fonts at <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/b.htm"
    target="_blank">Nick Curtis&#39;s site</a> such as Buenos Aires and Lagniappe
    Inline. <BR> <BR>But no exact match.

  body: Bubba Love seems to be one of the many great fontographer fonts which have
    completely disappeared. It&#39;s such a shame and I&#39;m really glad I have them
    already. I wonder if anyone plans to bring them back... <BR> <BR>I would love
    to know the source of the sample - if it&#39;s vintage it may be very hard to
    find. If contemporary it&#39;s out there somewhere &#40;unless it&#39;s in the
    fontographer vortex&#41;.
