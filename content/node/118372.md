  by default two points smaller than most other fonts (in Microsoft Word)?\r\n2. What
  do you think of Perpetua? Do you like it as a body text font?\r\n\r\n"

      difficult to work with in Word. Especially when font size 12 is being prescribed."

    that's your issue. People who prescribe a point size of 12 or any other number
    by default don't know anything about typography."

      My school's guidelines prescribe point size 12 for theses. But Verdana 12 is
      much larger than Times New Roman 12, etc. Such a shame many people are so shallow
      when it comes to typography. It irritates me to see other students use the default
      style and fonts in Word... is there such a thing as typography blindness?!"

      was used for the official wedding programme for the Royal Wedding in 2011. So
      yes, it's quite delicate. Too delicate for an ordinary marketing thesis at least..."

    you can't see what you don't know. Most people are indeed typographically blind
    because they lack the knowledge to see it. I'm blind in most other areas. My dad
    and brother often talk about specific car brands and car models. I don't see any
    of that; I just see cars. When it comes to typography, most people just see sans
    and serif."

    hope Microsoft will supply it with Office forever...
