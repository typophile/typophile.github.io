  fellow typophiles!\r\nNot sure about you lot but when I left\r\nmy undergraduate
  studies I was charged up with\r\nmotivation and vigour and ready to set the world
  on\r\nfire with my typographic innovation.\r\nBut six years have passed and I have
  had a wide variety\r\nof experience from major UK publishers to music magazines\r\nto
  starting my own practice.\r\nand I have only used vetica 3 times!\r\n\r\nBut I have
  reached a stage where I need some new\r\ndirection / inspiration [you know what
  I mean]\r\nAs a result I have been thinking about doing a\r\na sagmeister and having
  a year without clients /\r\nre-exploring what got me excited about typo-based-graphic-design\r\nin
  the first place.\r\nso I was thinking about working toward doing some post graduate\r\nstudies
  / locking myself in the shed with a laptop and a printer\r\nfor a year\u2026\r\nCan
  anybody advise on what they would do /\r\nwhat schools to look at\r\n[as you only
  get one chance and it costs you a lot of cash]\r\nI love European typography\r\nand
  can\u2019t get enough of Berlin\r\n\r\nBut this looks pretty mental\r\n\r\nhttp://www.werkplaatstypografie.org/\r\n\r\nI
  know others out there are thinking the same\r\nwhere did the enthusiasm go\r\n\r\nany
  advice or discussion would\r\nbe greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n"
