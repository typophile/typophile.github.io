  body: "I don't think I agree with the Century Schoolbook IDs, because the serifs
    on the E and T seem larger than in this sample. There are a boatload of Century-like
    types. I think it will take some close comparisons to nail this down, but I think
    Ray Larabie's Marion is closer, as is Corona, and even some of Carter's Miller
    family for Font Bureau. I am basing this mainly on the E serifs, so I need to
    look at more details.\r\n\r\nHave you looked at any of those?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "On further examination I don't think any of the three I mentioned are particularly
    good matches, especially Miller which has the wrong 't'. Unless the serif detail
    has been lost in this fuzzy scan, I still have trouble with Century Schoolbook,
    in spite of the way the lowercase seems very close, including the flat serifs.
    Because of the x-height, I think Paul's suggestion is closer, but the E, L and
    T serifs don't seem right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
