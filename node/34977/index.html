<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>What do you think are best practices for designing the '[[currency]]' symbol?
By 'Currency' I mean the Circle with the arms at diagonals rather than the Euro.
What I notice is that the newer the font the likelier it is that it will being some of the flavor of the font into the glyph. The older the font the likelier it is that the circle portion of the shape will be a perfect circle. This is true from serif to sans it seems and even into monospaced fonts.
What about height? Should it rest on the baseline or float gently - or mid way?
What uses are there for this glyph? Kent Lew suggested programmers use them sometimes... Can anybody elaborate?
Some developers seem to be using this space for other stuff - even jokey stuff. And some people are using it for the Euro. Comments?
Here are some samples - the 1st set is the round group. The second is the group with the fonts' style creeping in and third is the monospace examples.

<div class=commentbody>Well it should be centred between zeros/figures since it's a numerical symbol. Centred horizontal and vertical.<strong>0$0</strong> such as with other monetery symbols.
MS Word use to use it for a hidden symbol.

I believe it was sometimes used for the Euro symbol before its current position was fixed; I have a old proprietary corporate font which has a Euro at both positions. Which meant that it was very confusing working with Word financial tables...</div>

No, the U+20AC position was fixed very early on but because Apple wasn't fully Unicode they needed to put it somewhere in the Mac Roman character set. As there was no space, and the sputnik was rarely used, they decided that was where it should go. </div>

That is good to know. I suppose I will sweat it slightly for the reasons you mentioned.
Hrant, how do you justify your design? It seems a bit unusual. Some of those arms look like mickey mouse ears. That last one looks almost heroic. And then there are the ones which look like a head being attacked by four mosquitos.

I'm sure Linotype and other major foundries just used a generic symbol in their fonts as they did for other characters. i think the original AFDKO even had an option where upon building an OT font, symbols could be imported from a symbol font to fill in gaps where analphabetic characters were missing.</div>

Yes, it was a bit cheeky. In both cases.
And yes it's not exactly 'Zaph style' per se - in the sense that it bares traces of an individual.
I suppose what I was getting was hat it seemed that with a certain generation of designers* I was seeing the circle approach be abandoned in favor of the letting the font style determine how the glyph looks. HZ seems to belong to the 1st group. DeGroot the next.
Also, it does seem like HZ must have been okay with this being in his font. No?

<div class=commentbody>There are several regulatory and/or safety symbols that are prescribed logos. You'll find them on virtually any manufactured product. The one I think of most readily is that really ugly CE logo. You know the one I'm talking about, right? I don't know whether or not that is often found in fonts though. I don't think I've seen it. I do know that the design is pretty much uniform on whatever it's placed. It seems any reasonable designer would make some change to it if permitted, at the very least space it tighter, but I guess that's not allowed.</div>

I think there's been a general trend away from re-using generic glyphs. Type designers want to put their mark on the entire typeface, even if it means only subtle differences in these generics. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Simon,
it's not only Apple that replaced sputnik with Euro in their codepages (at least most of them), Microsoft did so as well. The difference was that in Mac OS 8.5, Apple did some additional silly things like patch the printer driver to always throw in the generic constructed Euro logo whenever a particular codepoint from the codepage came across. Microsoft only changed the internal codepage definitions, so the changes affected non-Unicode apps in a stronger way (i.e. whenever the sputnik codepoint was used an Euro appeared), while Unicode apps noticed the change in a smoother way (simply the new Unicode codepoint U+20AC was noticed/added).

I've incorporated the Euro symbol in a few fonts -- that are light sans serif with round proportions. But it only corresponded in one weight of the families, and not in Obliques.

I think you'll find this incorrect. There were some hack fonts made for a Win 95 euro support beta, but these were quickly replaced with a patch that updated codepages. The hack fonts did not, as far as I'm aware replace the sputnik U+00A4, but instead mapped the character to U+0080 a control character - a hack indeed, one that was quickly pulled, and one that I doubt had the same lasting impact as the Apple decision.
