  and I'm learning the language.\r\n\r\nMy question is: What rules exist for Arabic
  typography logos? I put this example:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Al_jazeera_Calligraphy_Animation.gif\r\n\r\nI
  don't understand the Arabic language and I don't know if the logo can be clearly
  read the meaning. I would like to know the function of the first lines disappear
  (see the beginning of the animation).\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a little analysis
  of the logo and the following link:\r\nhttp://www.limeshot.com/images/blog/logos/horse.png\r\n\r\nthank
  you very much"

  body: "That's a very interesting question!\r\nThe logo of AlJazeera is a calligraphic
    interpretation of the word 'Aljazeera' in Arabic. The logo can be read by native
    eyes fairly easily. But this is only a sign of a 'good'  and functional design.
    The same word could be rendered completely unreadable by another designer. Case
    in point, your second picture. That picture is, of-course, a horse. It is formed
    by Arabic letter forms. I'm pretty sure it is also contain coherent words. But
    if the intention was to be readable, it has failed the intention. Otherwise it
    is generally a common practice to use alphabetic forms to produce a visual form
    which is not meant to be read. I should add I do not understand Arabic and for
    a native Arab it may be somewhat easier to decipher the words hidden in the horse.
    But generally when you go that far, you really are not writing something to be
    read! It's meant to be seen.\r\nOh by the way, the first lines disappearing in
    the first animation are mostly ornamental but not randomly placed. Those lines
    are the extension of the extremity of several letters. They are used to create
    a visual balance in the calligraphy. But since they have a 'legitimate' presence,
    they do not diminish the ability of a native eye to read the word in the logo."

  body: Note that the wikipedia animation is misleading, the logo is based on [[http://www.google.com/search?q=Diwani+calligraphy&tbm=isch|Diwani
    calligraphy]] and thus the shapes are pretty normal relative to that specific
    style of Arabic calligraphy which is quite different from the simplified Arabic
    at the binging of that animation (seriously, who in his right mind would compare
    a Diwani based logo to Arial!).

  body: "If you want to design an arabic calligraphic logo I think you need somebody
    who is able to read arabic and one calligrapher. there are no rules, It's just
    about understanding of rhythm, design and deep knowledge of the writing system,
    either it's Nasta'liq or Diwani. second picture is an ornamental calligraphy (similar
    to tughra) and not a subtle one in my opinion and I agree with khaled, this animation
    is very bad way of interpreting the logo.\r\n \r\nsome good examples in Persian/arabic:\r\nhttp://www.qoqnoos.com/body/graphic/JABARI/p02.jpg\r\nhttp://www.honar.ac.ir/Farhangestan/images/Arm_Farhangestan.JPG\r\nhttp://nowrozkhani.persiangig.com/image/Jabbari/Jabbari%202.jpg\r\nhttp://www.qoqnoos.com/body/graphic/JABARI/p01.jpg\r\nhttp://www.qoqnoos.com/body/graphic/JABARI/p08.gif\r\nhttp://www.asriran.com/files/fa/news/1388/11/5/125504_965.jpg\r\n\r\nBahman.E"

  body: "Too bad you can't read Arabic. I have written an article with some analysis
    and useful links on the [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/tugra|Tugra]],
    which is a calligraphic device that is the basis of this logo. The article is
    in Arabic, but do check it out. You can also google the word 'tugra'. You will
    find a lot of material that will help.\r\n\r\nKhalid\r\n\r\nPS: It's nice to know
    that we have Behnam and Bahman here. I used to work with an official in the Iraqi
    government called Behnam. International Consultants called him Benham. Probably,
    yet another good example of 'unity and variety'. And, Alch, please update your
    profile and tell us more about who you are. Finally, the calligraphic style in
    the Al-Jazeera logo is Diwani."
