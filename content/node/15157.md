  a local DJ. Does anyone have any good websites that I could research fonts for the
  project. I don't want grafitti fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Interesting that you want to stay away from 'graffitti fonts'... most designers
    would start there, but it's often too stereotypical. Nice to see you want to look
    deeper. On the same note, stay away from any stencils or fauxtoshop spraypaint
    effects.\r\n\r\nI would suggest Whitney:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/whitney/testdriver/whitney-black.html\r\n\r\nWhile
    designed for museum signage and wayfinding systems, I think Whitney Black - set
    in all caps - for a DJ TV show would be an interesting concept. DJs are all about
    crowds. They control the rhythm and flow of the people. And Whitney was designed
    to help control the flow of crowds. Base the logo off of Whitney, put in some
    strong iconic reference (record groove marks, headphones, etc.) and see where
    it takes you.\r\n\r\nNot feeling Whitney? Try another direction. PSY/OPS's Reform
    or Serus: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html"

    will be of a girl mixing music on a turntable.

    you're avoiding cliches, you may want to stear clear from blackletter as well.
    it's unfortunate that this genre has been overused by the rap/r&b scene."

    stuff has a lot of hip-hop flavor, especially <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11382.0.0\">FF
    Flava</a>:\r\n\r\n\"An active member of the Dutch music scene, Donald Beekman
    designs a lot of hip-hop CDs and related ephemera. He says he found that Aachen
    Bold, being bold and rough, was often requested by his clients. Working with Aachen
    gave him the idea to develop a more outspoken alternative with a more contemporary
    feel. The first version of his new typeface was used on a CD called Rap Flavas,
    hence the name FF Flava. Used on a lot of music fliers, FF Flava's claim to fame
    came when it was used as the headline font in the book From Brooklyn to Breukelen,
    a summary of 20 years of Hiphop music in the Netherlands. Beekman calls it his
    \"ultimate nu-skool Hiphop font.\" The four weights of FF Flava can be layered
    for instant logos.\""

    that got me thinking about Positype's other faces.
