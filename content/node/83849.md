  body: "I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend using a local printer <em>instead</em>
    of a cheep web vendor for the following reasons:\r\n\r\na) It is important to
    patronize your local economy\r\nb) If the printer makes a mistake, such as poor
    registration, your chances of getting a reprint at no charge is much greater.\r\nc)
    You will develop a real relationship with a real person which, over time, has
    many benefits. For example, when you have been working with the same printer for
    20 years, they will often do you small favours that other printers normally wouldn\u2019t
    (deals, turnaround &c)."

  body: "I agree with Christopher's comments.  An additional advantage is that a local
    printer has actual paper samples to inspect and choose from. Also you can discuss
    your job with a real live person and they can point out any potential technical
    problems with your layout.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest using a small (but good) print shop.
    (Not a copy shop that does mostly xeroxing, but a real, full-service print shop.)
    A big print shop that's geared towards large jobs would probably not be an economical
    choice for printing a few hundred business cards."

  body: And as I get older I am increasingly impressed with the quality/capabilities
    of digital presses which are essentially bus-sized colour photocopiers. Nothing
    to turn your nose up at. Cheep, fast <em>and</em> high quality. They can handle
    pretty beefy stock as well. Most important is to find a good contact and person
    to work with. Respect their knowledge.

  body: "Visit a local shop, preferably a small to medium printer with with a 2 and
    4 color press. They'll often have a customer base that you'll fall into and can
    bang out that card in a few days.\r\n\r\nAlso, when using a local printer, you
    get to explore and feel different types of stock.\r\n\r\nDigital printing is much
    better nowadays in terms of color and quality (sometimes), but the backup is still
    a shotgun approach. Because you are printing both sides, you will want offset
    printing to get that backup exact, especially so if you have borders and artwork
    near the edge. \r\n\r\nFinally with digital printing, you won't get any coating.
    That's important with business cards because they'll be pushed into wallets and
    the color may rub."
