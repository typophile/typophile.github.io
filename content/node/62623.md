  have more photos than type. A previous book in the genre used Stone Informal but
  they want to replace that with something else that's different but the same, the
  usual story.  <smile>\r\n\r\nSo I think I'm looking for something that might be
  somewhere between a serif and a sans or perhaps a particularly lively sans font
  that's not one of the usual suspects.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts/directions/suggestions
  gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nJohn"

    like Stone Informal, but you might consider [[http://www.beorcana.com/welcome.html|Beorcana]].
    I think it would work well with the subject.\r\n\r\n"
