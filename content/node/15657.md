    the shapes of recurring letters.

  body: "Yves is quite right, of course, that these are handwritten. With that said,
    if you are looking for fonts that might approximate this calligraphy, you might
    look at Martin Wait's 'Wild Thing', Phill Grimshaw's 'Grimshaw Hand', John Viner's
    'Tiger Rag', Patti King's 'Skylark', and Tim Donaldson's 'Humana Script' to mention
    just a few of the casual scripts that are out there with (I think) a similar feel
    to your samples. These are all widely available for the major font resellers,
    like FontShop and MyFonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
