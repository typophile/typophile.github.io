  seems to have expanded more since the Technical Preview. You can get to far more
  features now. If you have 3.5GB of space lying around, try it out.\r\n\r\nSo far
  (after ten minutes of experimentation with just Gabriola) my only complaint is that
  the implementation of Stylistic Sets is mutually exclusive, against the spec. You
  cannot turn on multiple stylistic sets at once. So for example, something like Hypatia
  Sans, where stylistic sets toggle individual alternates for fine control, is crippled
  in this application. \r\n\r\nI will write feedback requesting that they modify the
  interface to change ss01-ss20 to checkboxes instead of a pulldown. Has anyone here
  had direct contact with the specific MS employee interested in this and capable
  of addressing it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GabriolaWord201050pct_6311.png]"

  body: "I am in the middle of writing CALT features for a handwriting font and a
    copperplate font, and just looking at Gabriola being typed with Stylistic Set
    7 turned on makes my brain hurt. My hat is off to Messrs. Hudson &or Mills [edit:
    I originally called him \"Ross\" implying \"Mr. Ross\" and not \"Mr. Mills.\"
    --JB] &or whoever wrote that CALT code. I'm wondering if there are also some many-to-one
    substitutions going on in there. I have yet to try Gabriola under older versions
    of InDesign or Illustrator.\r\n\r\n[edit again: now it puts my edited post out

  body: "<em>my only complaint is that the implementation of Stylistic Sets is mutually
    exclusive</em>\r\n\r\nYes, that is a problem, although not in the case of Gabriola,
    whose Stylistic Set lookups are designed to be mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    how Gabriola works: there are just about every kind of GSUB lookup employed. Stylistic
    Sets 6 and 7 make heavy use of contextual one-to-many substitutions: the big independent
    swash forms are zero-width glyphs that are inserted into the glyph string according
    to contextual rules. When I started the project, I wasn't sure there would be
    any applications in which I could even test these lookups, since MS didn't support
    the features and Adobe didn't support one-to-many substitutions, but by the time
    I'd finished the font Adobe had finally implemented that support, and now MS Publisher
    and Word are going to support the features.\r\n\r\nI did all the OTL feature work
    myself. Ross hinted the font, with advice from Mike Duggan. I can't say I actually
    understand how it is hinted, but apparently it is a relatively novel approach."

      body: Oh yes, and I meant "one-to-many" when I wrote "many-to-one." I would
        like to finally attempt a Latin font that employs one-to-many. You can completely
        redo connecting strokes using modular bits instead of grafting them on to
        every glyph and amassing hundreds of tedious variants. Of course I suppose
        in reality it will prove more complex. Does anything on the Apple side support
        one-to-many in Opentype yet? Aside from CS4 of course. Mellel perhaps?

  body: "I use VOLT.\r\n\r\nI believe Mellel should work with one-to-many lookups.
    And perhaps also Apple's own OT support? Try TextEdit.\r\n\r\nI've played with
    the idea of making a Latin connecting script font that splits letters into left
    and right side halves. I would use the 'curs' GPOS feature to tie them together
    -- even though there are no vertical offsets and the attachments would all be
    0,0 -- because otherwise you risk the letters being broken apart by tracking (of
    course, you probably want to discourage users from tracking a script font anyway,
    but users will do the darndest things).\r\n\r\nThe tricky issue would be overlap
    of joins, ensuring that rounding doesn't produce stem offsets or dropped pixels.
    This is less of an issue with subpixel rendering than it used to be. For full
    pixel rendering, you want an overlap of 70 units on 2048 to ensure no drop out."

  body: It seems that Word 2010 and Publisher 2010 don't support Stylistic Sets for
    Indic fonts. I tried to use these features in Word 2010 for Devanagari font and
    was very upset (I have about 15 sets). This is some strange discriminative attitude
    - it is still not possible even to search within syllables in Devanagari text.
