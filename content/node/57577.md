  currently working in an environment where Myriad is the face for the organization.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to have some advice on applying this face in a university setting.\r\n\r\nIt's
  paired with . . . Trajan. And the alternate fun face is Scriptina.\r\n\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nOne
  of my questions concerning Myriad is, why no extra light or thin? Does anyone know?
  And can you suggest something that will substitute in that usage?\r\n\r\nAnd any
  advice on using Trajan on a day-to-day non-movie-poster basis is always appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe
  bonus question would be whether or not there's an alternate alternates font for
  Scriptina that contains useful lowercase alternates - you're sensing the time already
  spent creating these by hand, aren't you?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance folks. "

  body: "<em>...why no extra light or thin?</em>\r\n\r\nI can't speak for Adobe, but
    I do know that Myriad was released (1992) before the general appearance of extra-light
    weights.\r\nAlthough Font Bureau had released hairline styles prior to Interstate
    Hairline (2000), that font was, IMO, instrumental in popularizing the concept,
    along, of course, with Neue Helvetica 25 and 35.\r\n\r\nI wrote on the topic in
    2001:\r\nhttp://www.shinntype.com/Writing/SeeLight.pdf\r\n"

  body: "I wish that Myriad had a lighter variant too. I might use it more if it did.\r\n\r\nTrajan,
    although a bit too common for my tastes, is beautiful typeface. All of the Renaissance
    types like Garamond and Jenson have their uppercases modeled after similar inscriptional
    styles. As such, try to think of where you would use all caps Garamonds or Jensons,
    which would usually be in titling.\r\n\r\nIf you use Trajan for titles, and Myriad
    for the body copy, you might have something."

  body: DanGayle, et al, can you describe what you mean by titling? I think of this
    as a fairly formal usage, and only one kind of usage. As a magazine subhead or
    as a head for a sidebar on a postcard, um . . . less good.

  body: " . . . ok, so, not much to say about ole Myriad.\r\n\r\nIf Adobe is watching
    this space, please heed my plea: \r\n\r\nOh hands of the makers look upon your
    servants needs and reach forth into the kiva from which all shapes come, and from
    the mud bring us Light, and Light Italic, and even Thin, and bring us Light and
    Thin titling and small caps of Myriad form. We your servants beseech you help
    us in our daily tasks to hold you up, paragons of proportion and grace . . . hear
    my prayer, most humbly offered, for something like $28 per single user license.\r\n\r\nAmen

  body: "Who doesn't have Myriad? It comes on every Adobe application made, practically.
    There are even free versions that come with Acrobat. (Not free as in freedom,
    but free as in beer.)\r\n\r\nOr go buy one of the educational packs from Adobe.
    You'll get all weights of Myriad/Minion/etc., and you won't break the bank."

    specially for publication work inside this style envelope.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't
    have is Myriad Extra Light, and Myriad Thin, and Myriad Extra Thin and Myriad
    Hairline.\r\n\r\nI do have Myriad Light, which is somewhat light next to the Regular,
    but I need more contrast."

  body: If you have the MM fonts you should be able to make your own extralight. IIRC
    When I used to use Quark 3 and Myriad I could render thinner than now available
    and fatter than now available.
