  on the type only please. I'd like to hear your ideas, how to improve it. It's too
  wonky and inconsistent at places.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-kole"

    or Ear? H is problematic\r\n\u2022\_EA probably should almost touch like that.\r\n\u2022\_REC=Dark,
    ORDS=Light is odd, I'd do them all negative or.. Hear negative and Records positive
    etc. Not half a word.\r\n\u2022 Negative space between R and E is wonky. Actually
    all the way through records is wonky.\r\n\r\nOverall I think you'd improve it
    if you focused on making it \"drippy\" all the way through the letters and counters.
    More like the \"HEAR\" part, though that could also be more fluid. THe artificial
    parts of the RECORDS added for legibility need to be rethought so they are less
    contrived... the worst offenders are the area above the C and Especially the S.\r\n\r\nBag
    under the hippo eye? :-)"

  body: "it's called i ear music but i can only see eyes... the typography reminds
    me of the trippy aerosmith logo - needs a bit of work on the text - there is no
    clever reason to split the word pos/negatively so how about making each word a
    different colour?\r\n\r\ni'm probrably missing the whole blue shape thing... my
    only concern being a record label is the size differential of the text to the
    rest of the logo - at an appropriate size for the back of a CD the \"wobbly\"
    text will be tiny..."
