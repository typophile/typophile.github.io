body: "Last night I was bumping around typophile and I hit a link that took me to
  a page that showed 2 letterforms. One was something like Times, and the other was
  something like News Gothic.\r\n\r\nThey used 2 new terms I hadn't heard before.
  For the sans-serif with no thick-thin transition it was called something like \"uni-stroke\"
  or \"non-axial\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone help refresh my memory please?"

    the thins are aligned.  Also known as stress.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stress_4973.png]\r\n\r\nSo
    if it was non-axial, that would indicate that there was no stress at all.\r\n\r\n'uni-stroke'
    indicates to me that the width of the letters is uniform over the entire character."
