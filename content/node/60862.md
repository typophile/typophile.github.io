    vision is all messed up and I've been saying stupid things. The \"S\" and \"i\"
    are completely the same... the search is on.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-g-type/gizmo/\">Gizmo</a>
    has the same feel but not exact."

  body: "Nina\r\n\r\nCut and paste possibly, but then the \"i's\" are identical? but
    still cut and paste. Not that you are wrong, It is just so hard to tell : )\r\n\r\nI
    use cut and paste all the time and I could make letters identical when I work
    but what is the point. It's a toss up. Check out www . ugly . com. Just kidding.
    Why would anyone copy these ugly forms?\r\n\r\nMichael"

    S's are identical. Gizmo is close, but it's not quite the same. I've been searching
    with no luck."

    but haven't had any luck at this point. With someone using it on LogoPond may
    indicate it's one of those fads. Maybe email the guy on LogoPond?\r\n\r\nTime
    to check the Graffiti sets.\r\n"

    with the same name? Those aren't different styles, they are completely separate
    fonts. Grrr...  :\\\r\n\r\nAt least my gut reaction to check free fonts first
    was right."
