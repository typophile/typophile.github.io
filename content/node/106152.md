  body: "Thanks Don. Dick told me it could be Chalet Comprim\xE9 which is the closest
    I got so far. The only differences I could see is on /R leg terminal, Chalet's
    is slightly curved and TPBTP's not which I assume could be due to LD quality sample."

    it should be Chalet Comprim\xE9 (or at least Chalet slightly customized), this

  body: Yeah, it is too bad that Dick Pape was 'run off' from Typrophile for being
    IMHO too good at identifying fonts. Apparently this Font ID section is only for
    purchasable fonts.
