  need to know the font both for the word Tomato, and Soup on Warhol's Campbell's
  soup print.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nAlso, in the likelihood that both these font are
  fairly obscure and hard to find, does anyone have some suggestions of a lookalike
  that would be easier to get a hold of? "

  body: That thread is similar, but only IDs the logo font, not the other two.  Does
    anyone know what the other two are?

    it's this image, you could get a rather close approximation with Shannon Bold
    or Formata for TOMATO and  Bookman Bold or Bramley Bold for SOUP  "

  body: "I've never been quite sure what typeface they used for the kind of soup,
    if it was a typeface. It may have been custom or hand-lettered, even though it's
    very plain. I sometimes imagine there was an old guy at Campbell's whose job it
    was to design and letter the cans. He'd been there forever. They couldn't let
    him go, he was like family. Finally, some time in the Seventies, he retired or
    died, and they started using type on the cans. Or something like that.\r\n\r\nFor
    \"TOMATO\" <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/itc_mixage_2/?sample_text=TOMATO&sample_size=36\">ITC
    Mixage</a> is very close if you condense it a bit. (It's condensed soup, so it's
    okay.)\r\n\r\nBoth \"Campbell's\" and \"SOUP\" go way back to when labels were
    mostly drawn by hand. You won't find fonts that match exactly."
