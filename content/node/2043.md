    <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t a truckdriver or a convoy-roadie, but my early teen years
    took place back in the CB radio heyday. My CB handle was Gronk, for no real reason
    other than it sounded good over a pre-amplified power mic. My Canadian citizen&#39;s
    band call number was XM2320537. I still remember the look on my parents faces
    when I drilled a hole through the wall in my closet and installed the 20 foot
    omnidirectional antenna on the roof of the garage. <BR> <BR>8&#39;s and 10&#39;s
    on the side, y&#39;all.'
