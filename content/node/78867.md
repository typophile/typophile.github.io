  Narrow]] and [[http://klim.co.nz/unitslab_info.php|Unit Slab]]together for a magazine.
  Stylish but serious. I may also use them in print for a book that accompanies the
  magazine's branding. \r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n1) Are these a good match?\r\n\r\n2)
  If you had to pick a simple typeface (serif) for the book's body text, what would
  you choose?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    is a prejudice against horizontal scaling, but the effect varies from type to
    type, and IMO a face such as Unit Slab is not adversely affected by it; let your
    eyes be the judge."

    would be ok?

    don't know what kind of book you have in mind, or what kind of page layout.\r\nI
    had assumed it would have a somewhat interesting design, being \"a book that accompanies
    a magazine's branding\"."

  body: "Fair enough... I did imply that. :) It is a book that \"shares\" the magazine's
    branding, and true, it will have some unique layouts, but mostly it will be  a
    standard \"chapter book\" type book.\r\n\r\nDo you still think Unit would make
    a good choice? If not, any other thoughts/suggestions?"

  body: "I don't see why not, but why not work with it on a page and see for yourself?\r\nAfter
    all, if you are already using it in the magazine, wouldn't you want to see if
    such a magazine choice could also be made to work in the accompanying book? Isn't
    that the challenge, to find a typeface that has such brand consistency across
    two (or more) genres, and presumably different paper stock, and yet still excels
    in each?"

    I do see and agree with your point. \"Try and see\" is the only real way to find
    out. I tend to obsess over this kind of thing, so input is a good way to choose
    an investigative path, even if it is not the ultimate decision. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your input!"
