body: The main title font for [[http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0813123771.jpg |
  "Philosophy of Film Noir"]]. Its also used for the chapter headings. The [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0813123771/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link
  | amazon listing]] is another place to get a better look at the font. I've been
  reading the book and really enjoying, but the font just leapt out at me. thanks.
