    in that development where he seems to give up making the dorky letters behave
    and starts modifying an existing accomplished design...  :-/\r\n\r\nYou should
    get a copy of the 16-page booklet detailing Haas Unica's development.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "idk, Hrant, it's possible they just took a long time off, continued thinking
    about it in their minds, and came back with a clearer vision.  The biggest problem
    I have with the face is that it is too Helvetica-esque.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole,
    there is a woeful lack of good documentation of actual type design as it progresses
    out there."
