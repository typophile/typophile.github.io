  like \xE6 and \u0153? If I decide to use them in cases like \"medi\xE6val\" or \"\u0153uvre\",
  how much consistent should I be in forcing this spelling in quotations, in titles
  of various works (for example, if an article is cited which is titled \"Sets Are
  Haecceities\" (thus spelled), should I retain the digraph or should I force the
  ligature on it? Likewise, when transcribing Latin, should I keep the original spelling
  in the sources (and their titles), or should I unify it to my style?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your ideas,\r\n\r\nLukas"

    maybe for one small thing: beware Italic fonts have an \"\xE6\" that looks too
    much like an \"\u0153\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
