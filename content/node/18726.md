  another one (if the link works) I am not sure about the upper case B and a few other
  letters, but like the way the lower case is shaping up - it works really well in
  a tight configuration. Check out the examples designed for Coke - but not enacted
  yet. \r\n\r\nAny feedback appreciated.\r\n\r\nJason.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bubbled.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/bub_ex1.jpg]"

  body: "Yeah it's one of those fonts that is similar to heaps of fonts yet subtly
    different. I am having difficulty with the Lowercase S, the numbers and the upper
    case B. I thought that if the B had even curves it would not fit the rest of the
    face, but could be wrong.\r\nCheers"

    I see where you going. It's exactly the same trouble I was having with the B -
    I'll keep working. Thanks for your notes on the lower case h definitely something
    I overlooked.\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "Another existing font, very similar, is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/roller-baby-bv/\"
    target=\"_new\">Jess Latham's Roller Baby</a>\r\n\r\n<em>The xheight-restricted
    h is indistinguishable from an n [...] Maybe try something like this for the B?</em>\r\n\r\nYep.
    Jason with a stroke this fat the most practical structural solutions point to
    a unicase scheme. Capital H form is the obvious and easiest solution for \"h\".
    Suggest making both \"i\" and \"I\" capital form with serif/bar top & bottom.
    \"d\" and \"b\" have legibility problems, and make \"D\" and \"B\" more attractive,
    practical forms.\r\n\r\nGuessing: the counterless glyphs, you left the counters
    out to maintain consistent stroke width? A lot of successful ultra-bold fonts
    break that rule, the best example springing to mind is Gill Sans ultra bold. Check
    out the \"a\", \"g\" and \"e\" in that font. Those letters violate the font's
    stroke width rule, but nobody complains, and it's one of the most popular ultra-bolds
    around.\r\n\r\nIn short---it's okay to cheat. In fact cheating is neccessary,
    practically all successful type designers cheat, and a lot of well-known fonts
    would not be possible without cheats in their construction. The E in Mark Simmonson's
    Mostra, and just about every ultra bold font. Think of cheating as a form of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThis
    has potential. I recommend steering it further from Roller Baby, as it's rather
    close.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "Hi Guys,\r\nThanks for your feedback. I quite like the lower case letters,
    and want to steer away from a bar on the top/bottom of the \"I\". I like how the
    face shows just enough to make out letters (and words), its what gives the typeface
    it's feel. I have revised the face a little and included alternative letters.
    Any comments would be appreciated. There are obviously similarities between others
    similar faces - because the style of the stroke only allows certain ways for the
    letters to be constructed.\r\nCheers Jason.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/

    closed. I suggest terminating it at 45 degrees like the C. Consider this for the
    2 also.\r\n\r\nYou should probably just scale down your @ to the size of a letter
    because that's the way everyone will want to use it."
