  body: Yes, if I recall correctly, though it really shouldn't be problematic to think
    that far back! It was up and running in Windows 7 and I used it to create a few
    things but then switched to a more stable build of FontForge on Ubuntu (more stable
    than FontForge on the Windows machine, to be clear) to achieve the same thing.
    It was pretty basic but stable and I plan to look at it again at some point.

    I'm told the best solution (other than another font editor) is to run a Linux
    VirtualBox on Windows and run the Linux version of FF under that.\r\n\r\nThe Mac
    and Linux versions of FontForge are reportedly much more stable."

  body: "<blockquote>I hear a lot of complaints about stability of the Windows version
    of FontForge.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt has been a real pain for me on Windows, the
    most notable issue being unexpected shut down of the app, with no clear indication
    as to why. However, not being a requirement that it works in Windows (for me)
    means I am not particularly bothered either. My experience with the Mac install
    is much better and with Ubuntu (running through VirtualBox on my Mac) it is (so
    far) faultless."

  body: "I've downloaded Birdfont and tried it for a few minutes. I didn't like it.
    It looks simpler and a lot prettier than FontForge, but the interface feels backwards
    in a lot of ways, notably how simple drawing tools default to the right mouse
    button instead of the left. Plus there is the insistence that if you don't pay
    a donation the author for what is supposed to be free, open-source software, it
    compels you to license fonts made with it under SIL-OFL terms. You can't even
    download it unless you enter a number in the donation box (though it will accept
    a zero).\r\n\r\nI'll give it another try later for a more thorough evaluation,
    but it just gives me bad vibes so far."

    more stable than FontForge.
