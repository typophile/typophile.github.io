  body: 'Hi John. <BR> <BR>I think many of your characters contribute to setting up
    a good rythm in this font: the a,b,c,d,e,g,h,i,j,l,m,n,o,p,q,r, and u. OK, maybe
    it would have been easier to point out the ones that are breaking the rythm, but
    I&#39;m trying to keep it positive :-&#41; I like the diagonal terminals very
    much &#40;f,g,j,r etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for advice, let me start by saying in
    a heavy condensed face you are going to have &#34;holes.&#34;  Here the f and
    r are glaring. Consider extending the crossbar on the f. <BR> <BR>Also consider
    bringing the crossbar on the f and t to the same diagonal as your terminals. <BR>
    <BR>As mentioned before some characters arent following your rythm: k,s,and x
    &#40;v &amp; w?&#41; Some suggestions on how to bring them in. <BR> <BR>k. consider
    echoing the feel of the h. Give it that vertical feel. <BR> <BR>s. consider extending
    the terminals. Also the diagonal spine feels out of place. I think either take
    it up in weight &#40;to visually match the verticals&#41;, or really take it down
    in weight &#40;to match the horizontals, maybe even make it horizontal - like
    the e&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you keep the v and w the same, take some weight out ie
    taper the stems to create more white space &#40;particularly the bottom of the
    w. <BR> <BR>x. condense it up. Echo the vertival? The n and u sitting piggyback?
    or just condense it. <BR> <BR>Hope that wasn&#39;t too much negative. A as mentioned
    almost all of the characters are working. I&#39;m sure my type-o-terminology is
    all wonky. Just some suggestions... off to a great start. <BR> <BR>Good Luck!
    <BR>Randy'

  body: Thanks Randy.  <BR> <BR>I really couldn&#39;t find anything negative within
    your advice.  <BR> <BR>I work alone and sometimes lose sight of whats before me.
    But now I actually feel motivated and want to finish this font. Thank you... Your
    insight is great and valuable.
