  this font was DIN at first, but then realized that the \"1\" was not right. Anybody
  know what this one is?\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3877.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6598.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bet_4290.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks
  for any help!"

  body: Stephen, yep, getting close...looks a lot like it. But that "1" is not right
    yet. I went through their whole site looking for the "1" to help try to match,
    but no luck as of yet.

  body: Titling Gothic as American? Not as square as this. More warmth in glyphs like
    the ampersand. I guess I should say "older".

  body: "There are several 'signature' elements in this font (duh!), but the closure
    of the C, oblong O, and the style of R are proving to be an elusive combination
    for me. We even see the G, M and Q, which you think would help nail it, but so
    far I have not found a match.\r\n\r\nThis site doesn't strike me as a place that
    would be getting custom font work done, so this is probably sitting out there
    somewhere, but so far my best (poor) match has been <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ketchupa_reg.asp\">Ketchupa</a>
    from Fountain. Most shapes are OK, but the R is wrong and the 1 isn't right. I
    like Ketchupa because the edges are softened, but that is also unlike the posted
    sample. I told you it was a poor match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If it's custom, I'm betting on Stephen's suggested Titling Gothic Narrow
    Medium. It seems to be the closest match.\r\nDoing more research on this company,
    they are huge-huge, and I wouldnt doubt that as part of their all new re-brand
    they went this custom route. BUT...I am still checking around!"

    last, recently I have discovered the ID of this font. I felt like a character
    in a Dan Brown novel unraveling the shrouded mysteries that cloak this font. Well
    I finally have my answer. \r\nIt's called Vibration, and its a FontBureau font,
    originally created for VIBE Magazine. It's not available on the site, but they
    will sell it to you over the phone. I hope this info helps some of you, and for
    those that have helped along the way, I also thank you."

  body: The latest (3rd, hardcover) edition of the Font Bureau type catalog includes
    Vibration Gothic -- the book must have been printed during that brief period after
    the font was released from Vibe-sclusivity and before it was pulled from the FB
    site.
