  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear typophiles, 

I feel the industry of type is very reluctant to give its sales figures. In book publishing it is often a known fact that such or such title has sold that many copies. I know the two industries are quite different (mostly material/digital, quick/very slow…), and of course typeface licenses aren't as easy to count as books besause you have to take into account single licenses versus complete families, but still I'd be curious to know how many licenses have been sold of "best sellers" such as Meta, Gotham or Museo. How many font are the small foundries selling? How much does the industry of typography represent worldwide? etc. 

I know typography isn't the best place for money making, and it's great that we're all in it out of passion, but it's no reason to be ignorant on the matter! 

Does any of you have some elements of answer? Do you know where I could find documentation on the subject? 

Many thanks! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">For publicly traded companies, the figures are a matter of public record, although some of the companies, like Adobe and Microsoft, derive only a small proportion of their revenues from type:

For privately-held companies, the information may or may not be avialable, if you search on a per-company basis; e.g.,

For single-proprietor shops like mine, you're basically asking us to post out tax returns online, which ain't gonna happen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought about asking something similar to this question. I'm more interested in licenses because it occurred to me that privately-held companies wouldn't post anything concerning how much money they make (the same thing oldnick says in the previous post). Maybe just one example of the number of licenses sold for one font family would be enough, at least for me. It's just to get a better idea of the market.

I'm particularly interested in some numbers from webfont retailers and services (like Typekit and MyFonts, although numbers from distributors/foundries like WebType or Typotheque would be great too), but I think that that is to much to ask. Maybe most designers who have thought about selling their fonts through some of this retailers have wondered about this or something similar.

Maybe someone will satisfy our curiosity.
