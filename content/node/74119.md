  to help me out...\r\nI've been asked to design a birth announcement, the father
  is Dutch and the mother is Greek so the announcement should be bilingual.\r\nI'm
  already using Zapfino but can't find a font that has Greek characters and matches
  Zapfino.\r\n\r\nDoes someone have suggestions or hints how I should handle this?\r\n\r\nA
  big thanks in advance,\r\nDries"

    for one, Zapfino tends to steal the scene from pretty much anything and, on the
    other hand, I don\u2019t think that contrast is the best way to match typefaces
    for a wedding! ;-)\r\n\r\nOne of the few swashy scripts that support Greek is
    Champion Script: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-champion-script-pro/\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you could find several less flamboyant typefaces still suitable for a wedding:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/elegant+charset%3Agrk/"

  body: "It's for a birth announcement so I was thinking of using Zapfino for the
    name of the girl, obviously the most important element of this piece. But you
    would suggest a different font? I like the look and feeling of Zapfino, swashy
    but not too swashy, hard to explain, totally different from a font like Champion
    script or Bickham script.\r\nJust discovered the combination of Zapfino (Dutch)
    and Rotis (Greek and Dutch) seems ok at first sight."
