  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">G-Type is Nick Cooke's Foundry

Nick Cooke started his typographic journey as a lettering artist, in London, in 1982, crafting type by hand for book jackets. Working with David Cox (the great nephew of Eric Gill) was for him an apprenticeship into acquiring an appreciation of letterforms and proportions.

Involved in the digital type eversince computers made it to the mainline, he began to experiment with designing complete typefaces using Fontographer. His first type family ’Penguin’, developed while working for Prima magazine, was accepted by Fontshop International in 1995. His second type family, an one-off script font ’ITC Dartangnon’ was produced in a similar manner at his next place of employment.

His independent career started soon after, as Fontworks UK started comissioning him custom typefaces for their clients. Later on, following his suggestion, they were more than happy to market his proprietary designs under the G-Type Foundry name. So, he started the G-Type foundry in 1999 to develop innovative and original - but most importantly, usable typefaces.

Nick Cooke is still doing comissioned work for Fontworks UK as well as custom type and lettering for his own clients.
