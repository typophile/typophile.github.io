body: Hi everyone.  I was wondering if I could get some font suggestions for a logo
  for a swing dance instruction company.  They do workshops and private lessons for
  all kinds of swing dancing (east cost, lindy, charleston, etc.).  I think there
  2 big unique positions are that they focus a lot more on connection whereas other
  instructors just teach the steps and moves.  The other unique selling point is that
  they are really good at teaching couples, although they've done private workshops
  for weddings and other things as well.  I think the company's name is going to be
  Swing This! Tips?
