body: okay, would it make you puke if, say, a magazine which in the past has used
  helvetica nueu exclusively started using a different sans serif for titles and pull
  quotes?

  body: "No. I actually rebelled when Harper's Bazaar, which was using mostly Didot
    switched to sans. But, then I warmed to it. I really was sad when they switched
    back to Didot. It seemed a great way to liven the entire line of Bazaar's up.
    That magazine has not been the same since Liz Tilberis (RIP) passed away. Photography
    is still brillliant, but the design has repeatedly fallen short. IMHO.\r\n\r\nSo.
    I see no reason why a magazine cannot change as long as it is for the better."

  body: i think certain magazines should change, hell, every mag could use a lift
    once in a while. and i tend to think that it would be okay for me to mix two sans's
    but i'm not sure how to do it. i was thinking about using Interstate (all caps)
    for titles and pull quotes and leaving the text helvetica but i'm a bit leery
    about using two overexposed, lower quality typefaces together. i do like the way
    Interstate looks all caps, though.

  body: "When I was young and daring, I used Interstate in conjunction with Agenda.
    Interstate did the heavy work while Agenda was strictly in the text. I'm not sure
    if I should be admitting such a combination but it still seems to work in an odd
    sort of way.\r\n\r\nMixing sans is a difficult thing to do. I think either (A)
    they both have to be of the same lineage, i.e. Humanist, Grotesque, Geometric;
    or (B) the title face needs to be more geometric or grotesque and the text face
    needs to be very humanist. This is only a theory. I hope others respond to this
    as I'd be interested in others opinion.\r\n\r\nYou are right. Magazines should
    not become stale."

  body: i've had similar thoughts on the matter. which brings me to another question,
    if i can do some hard convincing and change the typeface of the body text, what
    typeface would you recommend as an alternative. i've always been partial to news
    or trade gothic but i would love to be exposed more typefaces.

  body: "How much text are you setting with a sans? Just out of curiosity? \r\n\r\nYou
    might consider a grittier sans such as <a href=\"http://www.macrhino.com/\">Sophisto
    or Stalemate</a> for the heads, captions, callouts and other things. \r\n\r\nI
    find that magazines which do use all sans tend to have difficulty setting forth
    a clear hierarchy. One important factor to consider is contrast. One obvious way
    to include contrast is sans versus serif. With using only sans you elimate that. "

  body: i hear you, but this magazine has to be all sans. on top of that, the publisher
    is tough and doesn't trust anybody's opinion. so if i want to make things better
    i'll have to do it without a lot of fanfare. those typefaces are nice but i'm
    thinking classic geometric with less contrast. also, i'm setting anywhere from
    200-1200 words.

    back down. To me, such publications are saying \"we're more concerned with our
    image than whether you are comfortable reading our publication.\" To which I say
    \"fine, I'll take my readership elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThat being said, if you want
    to mitigate that tendency as much as possible, a good humanist sans would help
    a bit.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    to comment on T. Leaves question: If you can swing it, spring for a humanist sans
    with a wide range of weights, and use the extremes in display settings (e.g. extra

    comes to mind."
