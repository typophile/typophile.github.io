  using sort glyphs then using index mode.\r\nAfter saving my encoding, I exported
  my font and now when I type \"A\" another symbol comes up. This with every glyph
  in the font.\r\nAny thoughts on how to fix it?\r\nThanks!\r\nRodrigo"

    back to CHARMAP Mode. Another thing you should check: Under <strong>Font Info
    &gt; Supported codepages and default character set</strong>, make sure that the
    Microsoft\xAD&reg;\xAD\xAD\xAD Character Set option DOESN'T say <strong>Symbol</strong>.
    Sometimes, FL gets confused and assigns Symbol encoding on its own, which will
    seriously mess up how characters are displayed in a finished font."

    Also I turned on glyph reordering to auto under preferences panel. This gives
    me a warning about the kerning table which I'm curious to know how to export it
    with the OT kerning and the glyph order ok.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRodrigo"
