  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">ditto to Grants comment. userbility goes down. <BR>As far as uniqueness is concerned. Well new &quot;s&quot; is ceratinly interesting but in my opinion not complete. the center slant on the &quot;s&quot; is thicker than the slant the &quot;e&quot;, &quot;g&quot;  and &quot;a&quot;. I am not sure if it is intentional or not but it looks too thick especially in the bold weight. I am also noticing the top counter in the lc &quot;g&quot; is sitting kind of low and not centered. This I suspect may be intentional.  <BR>I tell you Joseph, I am a sucker for unusual forms but these days  <BR>I find myself regretting certain recent purchases (Sophia from Fontsmith as well as Friendly from Die-Gestalten) because of userbility issues. <BR>I guess Stephan might be right in some ways.  <BR>A designer/agency may purchase the new version but will it be used a lot-I am guessing properly not. If one of your goals is exposure of Pill in award winning design the i would suggest going back to basics.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29014.jpg" alt="pill"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I just printed and I still feel the same about the new 'Ss'. The <BR>whole design is more congruous now. <BR> <BR>Some other things I noticed: <BR> <BR>- Some of your numerals seem a little long - the '7' especially, as <BR>it descends below the other descenders. <BR> <BR>- Your small caps are the perfect height. Nice. <BR> <BR>- Is the kerning done? The apos-s pair is a little tight. <BR> <BR>- The difference between the comma/apos/quote form and the <BR>square period is just fine until a semicolon appears. Maybe the <BR>period can get a tad smaller? Closer to stem width. DIN's, in <BR>particular, is much lighter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><BR> <BR> I agree that there is something not quite right with the s's, though I think I'm on the right track. It's true that the font behaves completely differently with the funky S's. It supports my theory that the character of a font can be changed drastically with a smattering of alternates (see Uncial New in the Critique:Blackletter/Uncial category). I really wish OpenType software (i.e. InDesign) would let type designers name their own features, which would then come up under the font menu. Why have a &quot;Titling Alternates&quot; check box when the font really needs a &quot;Funky S&quot; feature? I can understand why standard naming conventions would be desirable for standard features (smcp), but why won't the software recognize non-standard features? The question seems so obvious to me that it makes me angry. <BR> <BR>The cross-bar on the new s' are too wide. Good call. As for Hrant's last comment: too terse : ) For now, however, I think that the funky s will have to live in an OpenType category like titling alternates, or something like that. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think we're really just talking about stylistic preferences now. Some like the new s, some don't. I personally dislike it (rather strongly in fact). The reason is the techno reference Stephen mentions above. I think this S treatment pushes the whole face too far in that direction both in display and in text. I don't know what else to say. It's actully makes is less buyable for me. <BR> <BR>But the fact that some do like it suggests to me that you should include one or the other as an alternate.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; <i>Grant, you must figure out a way to show small caps on</i> <BR>&gt; <i>the website. You can't rely on people to read for that info.</i> <BR> <BR>Very true. Our bottleneck right now is the time it takes to properly create custom, family-specific displays for all of the new (and existing) fonts. Our goal over the next dozen weeks or so is to replace our generic 'Divergently' displays within the Umbrella collection with showings that are unique to each face.  <BR> <BR>Eventually, these improvements would continue through the most popular typefaces from the other foundries as well. Right now, we are really limited by our internal creative resources. We are definitely concerned with displaying the typefaces in the most appropriate and complimentary manner as possible. <BR> <BR>Frankly, the better it looks, the more you sell. <BR> <BR>&gt; <i>Also, will Veer be adding PDF specimines any time soon?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, and hopefully soon. This is not something that we can easily accommodate with the product database solution we are currently tied to. However, we are in the process of finishing up a brand-spanking new system that will allow us to add external data types (like custom PDF specimens and links to designers website, for instance) to individual product pages. <BR> <BR>Not yet, but soon. <BR> <BR>Another thing we are going to address is the ability to view complete dynamically-generated character set, a la MyFonts. Oh, and a preference that maintains a consistent, user-defined text string for all of your Flont samples is also going to be available shortly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Pill Gothic Review: Christian, this is a killer font! I am glad to see that all of the alternates made it into the final mix. I was also surprised to see an alternate &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot;. The spacing is nice and even throughout. I am setting some text at 8 point and the color is very consistent. The ligatures work perfectly and I like the addition of the &quot;Th&quot; lig. The &quot;fl&quot; seems a little awkward though. There are a few overlap problems that I noticed: the cedilla, o slash and ae. <BR> <BR>Bravo, Christian. This easily makes it into my current top ten!</div>

This is not a first for  <BR>Typophile - Atomic Media picked up some from this forum a  <BR>while back - but it certainly is a rewarding moment. Congrats  <BR>Christian. <BR> <BR>Christian sent me this typeface a few weeks ago (thanks again),  <BR>and I have to say it's quickly becoming one of my favorite sans.  <BR>It has both the utility I want from a sans and a uniqueness that  <BR>doesn't upstage the utility. Way to go Christian. Keep them  <BR>coming. <BR> <BR>(Oh, and I dig the weights listed by milligrams, depending on the  <BR>dose you want.)</div>

I'm still working with Christian to hammer out some naming issues for the PostScript version (which will be released shortly) and there's a bit of weirdness with the OTFs not likely OS 9, but other than that, folks are digging it.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A small update:
The other day I got a promotional mailer for the Luxor casino in Las Vegas, and it uses Pill Gothic for the cover, and some of the inside text. Besides enjoying the pleasure of seeing it in action out of the blue, I thought it looked great, and it&rsquo;s interesting to wonder if they chose it because setting &ldquo;Vegas&rdquo; in Pill Gothic results in something quite nice, mixing that rigidity with that trio of strong, and unexpected, diagonals.</p>
