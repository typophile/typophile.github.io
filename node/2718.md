  body: I don&#39;t know if it is worth it but Kaufmann &#40;the original I believe&#41;
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/swing/bold/testdrive.html?s=The%2BAlternative%2BBreak%2BConnection&amp;p=36"
    target=_top>Swing</a> are so close... but maybe Swing has more <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205253"
    target=_top> glyphs</a> &#40;for example the second lc p from Swing I don&#39;t
    see it in Kauffmann&#41;.
