  everyone! I recently started this new design blog (3 months ago) and I'm glad to
  share it with you guys :) The blog is about logo designs, both creative and design-rich
  logotypes. All of the designs is featured from <a href=\"http://www.dribbble.com\">dribbble</a>.
  I mainly started it because of my love to logo designs, that's actually also how
  I came up with the  name \"Logo Crush\". It now has a capacity of over 250+ design-rich
  logotypes (and counting), to inspire, learn from or simply to enjoy!"
