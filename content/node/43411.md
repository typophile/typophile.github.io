  body: "This isn't Gotham.\r\n\r\nColors has used a variety of sans-serifs over the
    years: Franklink Gothic back in the Tibor Kalman years, and Avenir more recently.
    In fact, I believe that's Avenir on the cover in your \"colors20\" sample.\r\n\r\nThe
    body copy in 22 is a humanist sans of recent vintage: it's not FF Kievit, but
    it's in that ballpark."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-6_4775.jpg]\r\n\r\nI stare at
    avenir all day, as it is our typeface identity at my in-house job. It is most
    definately gotham. The R is a little longer, which I find very characteristic.
    To be more specific, Gotham Bold (gotham medium pictured above in my example)."

  body: "I did read the one about Vorland!  brilliant!\r\n\r\nThanks for the responses,
    Gotham  bold looks right for the masthead.  But what about the body copy inside?
    FF Kievit is close...similar a, but ITC Eras has a closer g, p, and q.  Any more
    guesses?"

  body: "Chipman, you're right about the logo not being Avenir. I was referring to
    the cover lines, and should have been more specific.\r\n\r\nLooks like the logo's
    gone through a few iterations over the years. It may well be Gotham now.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    apologies for the (hilarious? pathetic?) misspelling of \"Franklink\" Gothic.
