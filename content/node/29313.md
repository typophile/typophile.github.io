  body: "ER: This is a beautiful editorial illustration, and I don't see any reason
    for it to be torn apart. I particularly like the strong line work in the face,
    the way you did the texture of the background, and the restraint you showed in
    the limited color palette. The composition is simple and strong; here is an artist
    who knows what she or he wants to say! Many posters are indecipherable at even
    a short distance. This one puts its meaning across. There's a history of this
    kind of social and political poster, and my guess is that the artist knows that
    tradition. There's a respect for the form in it. My gut tells me that this is
    someone who's going to continue to do great work.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose one
    area for more experimentation, it would be the headline type. Get ready for my
    harshest criticism. Here it comes: at the moment, the type is not quite up to
    the level of the illo. Whew, that's it. (Of course the illo is very good, so you've
    set the bar high!) When I'm choosing type, there's always the temptation to make
    the choice \"overly literal.\" For example: an article on France gets an Art Nouveau
    typeface, a poster for Berlin gets a blackletter, and the African film festival
    gets Lithos -- you get the idea. When the subject is war, then, the first (and
    most literal) choice might be a stencil font. In fact, so many people have made
    that choice, that stencil lettering, when the subject is war, has become something
    of a visual cliche. So on the type, I'd keep pushing it, trying other kinds of
    typefaces, even some that are completely unexpected and \"wrong\" for the subject
    matter. It's in that strange, ever-so-slightly wrong arena that really memorable
    type happens.\r\n\r\nThat's my two cents (probably worth only one). Please keep
    up the great work!\r\n\r\nSkylar\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm a sign painter in New Orleans."

  body: "I really like your use of colour, subtle green and black works really nice
    together. and the face is fantastically simply rendered. Agree with prev. comments
    about the font. \r\n\r\nIf I can ask one question: what does this poster say?
    Are you saying the military's intelligence amounts to thinking about tanks and
    bombs? And from that, that it's not really intelligence at all? My concern is
    that there is nothing in this poster to convince you that war/military is dumb
    unless you already think that war/military is dumb (and you only need to see the
    tools of war to reconfirm your already existing opinon). \r\n\r\nMy advice, for
    what it is worth, is to find a way to persuade, inform, argue, demonstrate some
    kind of point about war or the military or something...a question mark just isn't
    enough; it amounts to asking something like: \"Is the military really intelligent
    with its guns and tanks and helicopters?\" which to me just poses another question
    \"is it smart to fight?\", the reality is that many people think that sometimes
    it is smart to fight wars (I'm not necessarily saying this) so the question has
    to be, how will your poster convince this person to think again? what extra information
    will your poster provide to argue the point?\r\nhope this helps, disregard any
    or all at your own discretion :)\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: "The \"medulla oblongata\" is the anatomical name for that portion of the
    brain where ER has put the drawing of the Thinker. The ironic thing is that the
    medulla oblongata sends messages to the rest of the body (things like telling
    the lungs to breathe and the heart to pump) as opposed to doing any decision making.
    \ In other words, Edel has put the thinking as after the fact and too late to
    do any good! Quite clever actually!\r\nAlso, \"crapper\" is a slang English term
    for a toilet. My joke was trying to say that military inteligence is like thinking
    like Sh*t.\r\n\r\nDoes that clarify it enough for you Aziz? :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    something to make him look more aggressive in outline.\r\n\r\nMy problem is with
    the concept. If it is a reference to the Iraq war, the idiocy and incompetence
    has mainly been on the civilian side--Rumsfeld, Bush and Cheney, the unholy trinity
    of horrors. They ignored and fired military until they got those who would do
    their bidding. The military are extremely bitter, as yesterday's editorial in
    the Army Times calling for Rumsfeld's resignation indicates.  "

    did not see this as an Iraq War thing only. I saw more the general term \"Military
    Intelligence\" and that the only actions possible from military Intelligenmce
    are military actions because that is all they have in their heads.  Ask a butcher

    the civilian fool Rumsfeld as operational boss executing the request with supreme
    arrogance and amazing incompetence. "

  body: "Yeah, military intelligence \u2013 orthodoxy\u2019s moron, hunh hunh hunh.
    But leaving the plop plop fizz fizz (cheap bromides, get it? hunh hunh hunh) aside\u2026.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    my creds: I was in the U.S. Army for eight years. I\u2019ve done some unusual
    things, but I wouldn\u2019t have to kill you if I told you. We have people for
    that. I\u2019m a technical writer and editor, not a typographer or graphic designer.
    From the latter points of view, I\u2019m an aesthetic na\xEFf, and I\u2019m sure
    the poster\u2019s semiotics are giggling as they vault right over my head.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, the poster just doesn\u2019t say \u2018military\u2019 to me. The green
    and black color scheme strikes me as invoking an \u201Cold school\u201D that never
    was. The text is basically an Ishihara color blindness test, and the green is
    nowhere near real olive drab. Despite the SWAT crap you see on TV, real soldiers
    don\u2019t wear black in combat; it\u2019s too visible, even at night. Why not
    use a modern desert tan or urban camo or other break-up pattern? Overall, the
    poster seems flat, enervated, and simplisme, but perhaps that\u2019s part of the
    in-joke.\r\n\r\nConsidering the wide variety of military weapons, why repeat the
    same few weapons over and over? Here again, the items are old school big iron:
    planes (yes, even the F-117), tanks, and are those submarines or blimps? Think
    what you will about military intelligence, the fact is that modern armed forces
    run on information. It\u2019s called network-centric warfare. Why not use GPS
    or intel satellites, computers, UAVs, etc., etc., as design elements? And make
    the font something futuristic and high-tech, not tired old GI stenciling.\r\n\r\nInstead
    of the head, how about a helmet with night vision goggles? You could make the
    lenses purple or magenta or dichromatic, something that really pops and gets across
    the idea of surveillance and reconnaissance (black helicopters, if you prefer).
    Or go to the Natick website and see what\u2019s up with body armor and exoskeletons.\r\n\r\nIf
    you simply can\u2019t live without the visual \u201Cpun\u201D (otherwise empty
    head with big boy toys floating around) on military intelligence, OK, I have a
    suggestion for that, too. I\u2019m a fan of Polish posters. While I don\u2019t
    like the specific subgenre, they sure do have a way with bloody, bruised, mangled,
    exploded, and otherwise abused human heads. Why not go to a site like http://www.theartofposter.com
    (my favorite) or http://www.polish-poster.com and check out the work of artists
    such as Jan Lenica, Wieslaw Walkuski, Waldemar Swierzy, Wiktor Sadowski, and Andrzej
    Pagowski?\r\n\r\n"
