  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,  <BR> <BR>I am new to this board.. well posting wise.. (my first post!) but i've been reading it alot over the past few months.  <BR> <BR>anyways,  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>currently im taking typography 1 at my college. its alot of fun, our current project is to design a 27th letter of the alphabet using a provided face. of all faces I was given times new roman! haha! anyways, I wanted to see what people thought about this, or any suggestions. I am still learning about type, and i figured this place could help me out. we have to render these in ink at 2.5 x height, 5 times, replacing the created character with a letter in a 5 letter word.  <BR> <BR>my current concerns pertain to the descender on my letter. should it be the same distance down as the 'j' ? or should it be smaller? personal preference? i was looking at the face, and i guess i could argue that it was meant to be a unique form in the alphabet like the loop on the 'g' my professor brought this up in critique tonight.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17783.gif" alt="Kerned example"> <BR> <BR>Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Drew, <BR> <BR>Let me be honest. I think the length of your decender is the  <BR>least of your problems! Sorry&hellip; <BR> <BR>As a start at curing your letter of it's maladies, let me point  <BR>you to Jonathan Hoefler's course at typeophile that looks at  <BR>the very assignment you've got: <a href="http://typophile.com/courses.html">Type Design 110</a> <BR> <BR>Honestly, first check out what he's saying. What are the  <BR>characteristics of times roman? Given that, is the basic  <BR>stucture of the &quot;letter&quot; consistent with Times? How could it  <BR>be more Times-like in structure? Where is there evidence of  <BR>a pen? What angle is it held at? As a result, where are the  <BR>thick parts? Where are the thin parts? Where are the serifs?  <BR>Where does times roman break it's own rules? <BR> <BR>Your glyph needs all these questions to be asked. Take a  <BR>look, and if you're still at a loss, I'll give you more specific,  <BR>practical pointers. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing the fruit of your studies! <BR></div>
