body: "I was given the responsibility of designing the programme for my church choir's
  Christmas concert at the last minute, and threw one together in a single evening.
  So it's very basic, and I was very limited in my type choices, but I thought typophiles
  would appreciate a seasonally-appropriate example of multiscript typography (it's
  a Korean church in France). Sorry about the picture quality.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cantate1_5243.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cantate2_4679.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  Korean typefaces used were Munchebu Jemok Batangche (\uBB38\uCCB4\uBD80 \uC81C\uBAA9
  \uBC14\uD0D5\uCCB4; \"Ministry of Culture titling serif\") for the display and Nanum
  Myeongjo (\uB098\uB214\uBA85\uC870) for the text. The Latin uses Arno."
