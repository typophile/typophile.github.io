  body: "On the spine of both the jacket and the case, word spaces and even character
    spaces are larger than the space between the lines.\r\n\r\nEspecially on the case,
    this results in a sort of river which is very ugly. There actually seem to be
    two groups of words, JOAN--THE--MAGICAL and DIDION--YEAR OF--THINKING."

  body: "Ha! Some kind of consistent match for the colour schemes, typefaces and arrangements
    might lend some <em>continuity</em> there between the jacket and case.\r\n\r\nI've
    never felt it necessary to stack the author name and/or parts of a title on the
    spine; because I think the convention is that they should share a common horizontal
    axis, if not a baseline.\r\n\r\nAlthough I quite like that turquoise/black colourway
    and the (Bodoni? Didot?) capitals on the jacket, the case just looks like an unconsidered
    last-minute addition."

  body: "Just wondering: Whatever happened to (smaller) horizontal lettering on spines?
    (Horizontal meaning  across the spine.) Is it now felt to be old-fashioned?\r\n\r\nPoor
    visibility might be a problem, saleswise, on the jacket spine. But this shouldn't
    matter when it comes to the case itself.\r\n\r\nBen, would you consider it a fatal
    lack of continuity to have horizontal lettering on the case spine and vertical
    on the jacket spine?\r\n\r\nOf course, many books are too thin for horizontal
    lettering  to be practical, and so it might be easier for someone looking for
    a shelved book if the lettering is always vertical. (Then there is, of course,
    the old up vs. down controversy.)"

    note the most obvious error in the jacket type: the larger space between YEAR
    and OF than between OF and MAGICAL.'

  body: "John \u2013 I guess that whatever is most obvious must be in the eye of the
    beholder. But if they'd have gone with the convention, they wouldn't have had
    the spacing problems, no?\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the continuity is very important,
    so a change in orientation, Olli, would be workable only if all other elements
    of the design were consistent between jacket and cover. Naturally the sales &
    marketing departments tend to think I'm an idiot who gets hung up on the details.\r\n\r\n<em>
    And I wonder how they arrived at the decision to use a \u201CDidot\u201D\u2026</em>\r\n\r\n(I
    was in too much of a hurry to check earlier, and didn't dare label it a categoric
    'modern' for obvious reasons) Well, you can almost hear someone reckoning er,
    <em>sounds like</em> Didion, so let's use that one..."

  body: "Funny. So instead of \"Sounds Like\" disease it might in fact be \"I Just
    Like This Font\" disease, either on the part of her designer (maybe the publisher
    gives them same one every time unless they complain) or herself (in which case
    we might at least credit her for type-awareness). One thing though: if Didot has
    become an identifying style for the author (even initially thanks to a \"disease\")
    then it might make sense to keep using it. But looking at her other books that
    doesn't seem to be the case. So the origin of the disease is probably the particular
    designer (although you could say that itself arises from poor education in the
    graphic design field).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
