    Mingw port]] out.

    The unofficial mingw-version is meant to be used easily.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n1.
    When Windows Firewall reminds you that it blocks some functionality, you can choose
    not allow any network access. The problem is this port uses xming, but it doesn't
    really need any network access.\r\n2. Perhaps you want to change some line in
    the bat to\r\nstart /B \"\" \"%FF%\\bin\\Xming-6.9.0.31\\Xming.exe\" :9 -xkbmodel
    pc101 -xkblayout us -multiwindow -clipboard -ac -silent-dup-error \r\nbut I didn't
    change anything and it works well for me.\r\n3. It (well, I have only the 200909
    version) crashes occasionally. Remember to make backups."
