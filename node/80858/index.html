  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey, Typophile community, this is my first post here(Oh goody). I've been doodling these glyphs on and off, finally made an alphabet and a digital rendition. These haven't been vectored, or anything near it yet, I'm primarily working on letterforms right now.

Suggestions and crits? I'm very new to this, I've made one font prior to this and it was somewhat a disaster. So, this is my second font in the works. Cheers to this being better than [[http://www.fontspace.com/unhinderedreams/vaguely-fatal|Vaguely Fatal]].

Uppercase draft(Blue is possible revision.)

I'm very open to suggestions/critique! :)</div>

Unless this is supposed to mimic child's play?

I've been treating this font the way I draw which may be my first drawback. Pointers?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. Well individual characters have different weights.
2. /g/ is severely unstable (falling to the right)
3. /l/ seems left slanted because of the long bottom curve
4. some bowls are square-ish others round...
5. I don't think those tall points on /ij/ are working (bit too tall)

The thing is it's hard to say anything about this design because we don't know your desired intentions with this font. Maybe all the upper observations are desired. Maybe not. Maybe your font should be formal and with great finish detail or maybe wobbly.

Of all the letters so far I like /a/ the most (even thought it needs lots of work). It's bowl shape is particularly interesting. But unfortunately I can't say the same about any of the other letters. They don't even seem to complement each other.

This is a rough start.

What software do you use anyway?
What do you think of your own font (be critical)?
What are your intentions with this font?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Litera: Yeah, I can see that about the weights. 

I agree with you about the /g/, I've yet to design what to do with /g/'s tail yet, whether turn it into an eyeglass /g/ or keep it in the same style, but more balanced.

/l/ is another character that didn't quite turn out how I'd envisioned it. I'll probably straighten out the /l/

Working at fixing the bowls, I actually know which direction I'm going with the bowls; that is, more rounded bowls.

Yeah, I see that as well, I thought it might have worked, it seemed an idea worth trying although it doesn't look as good as I'd hoped.

My intentions for this font are to create a somewhat playful sans-serif, playful but crisp and clean(no weird wobbles). I'd like it to have capabilities to be used at relatively small sizes and still maintain itself, it's kind of held up with the letters as they are, though they're quite...well. As you said, they need work. I'd also like it to be a professionally acceptable font, which it isn't at all at this point.
 The fonts that  partly inspired this are [[http://www.dafont.com/steiner.font|Steiner]], [[http://www.ffonts.net/tag/0/euphemia|Euphemia]], and the slab-serif font, [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Memphis/fonts/|Memphis]].

Critically speaking; I like the thought of a "playful sans-serif"(I consider Euphemia slightly playful) and base idea, execution so far isn't all that I'm wanting it to be. I'm unhappy with the wobbles and weight inconsistencies primarily, next to widths of characters being somewhat haywire. I'm aiming at a font that's professionally acceptable(As far fetched as that sounds, it's a goal), and I don't feel I'm making that right now. I believe this has potential, needs polished a lot though.

Software wise I use FontCreator 5.6 . I'm still new to the program right now, I've used it only a handful of times, cleaning up initial glyphs has taken the most amount of time so far next to playing with kern.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Based on the fonts you mentioned (mostly geometric) and even though you mention playfulness I think this is a <b>very rough</b> start and there's a lot of work in front of you. Your glyphs don't look geometric at all. As of yet.

I suggest you first get acquainted with the software you're using to produce some nice flowing glyphs and only after you know how to properly use your tools start developing a usable font.</div>
