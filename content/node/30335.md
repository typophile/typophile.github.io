  body: "The information piece in white seems compressed, not a condensed version
    of a typeface? If so, I would strongly suggest to find a suitable real condensed
    face. Which would look more natural. \r\nUsing less different typefaces can help
    as well. Pick one or two nice ones, a sans and a serif maybe. Ones that have different
    weights.\r\n\r\nApart from that, the gradient in the left 'save the date' looks
    a bit, I don't know, cheesy. With all due respect of course.\r\nAnd there is <em>alot</em>
    of stuff that asks for attention, which may overwhelm the message you are trying
    to deliver."

    of importance and aesthetic value. I also agree with the condensed type comment,
    there are many a nice looking font out there that should suit your needs. '

  body: "The first thing I see is Save the Date wheras the important things, to me,
    are Mardi Gras in Paris II, followed by the date/time*, venue and ticket information.
    At the moment, after the banner, the logo and the subordinate copy overpowers
    the event title. The masks are almost rendered invisible while the Eiffel Tower
    has too much prominence (and there are some marks on the second storey which are
    stroked in black which would probably be better as black fill).\r\n\r\nTim\r\n*leaving
    aside the irony of celebrating mardi gras over a month after the event and on
    a Saturday"

  body: "Jelmar is right, there's something really odd about the that serif. Personally,
    I'd lose that face entirely and use a lighter weight of the sans you used for
    the big type below. \r\n\r\nThe swirls near the word SAVE are creating some nasty
    tension points where they get neat the banner. Reduce the size of the small one
    and get it away from the banner, and lose the little arc over the larger one.
    The same sort of tension points appear where letters on different lines are touching
    in the text at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI'd also do the \"SAVE THE DATE\" banner completely
    differently. That typeface doesn't work stylistically with anything else in the
    poster, and neither does arbitrarily tilting it. \r\n\r\nThe piece is also over-the-top
    visually; between the text, the swirls, the dancing guy, the masks, <em>and</em>
    the Eiffel tower, there's too much going on. I would tone down the swirls and
    lose the dancing guy.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to darken your colors in the background
    pick darker colors, don't use transparency tricks. It makes the overlap a bright
    little distraction, and darkening yellow by adding black makes the yellow look
    dirty, not darker.\r\n"
