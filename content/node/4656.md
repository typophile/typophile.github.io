  body: Thanks for the suggestion. I was wondering if the type was rounded to begin
    with or if it was once a normal type that just became distorted on video. Any
    ideas what techniques or machines are used to add subtitles to a video? <BR> <BR>Ramon

  body: Only thing I know of subtitles is that Stephen always links  <BR>to <a href="http://joeclark.org/access/captioning/"
    target="_blank"> Joe Clark&#39;s website</a> every time they get mentionned.

  body: That actually looks like laser subtitling for film, producing stroked &#40;monoline&#41;
    fonts with little blobs at stroke ends. <BR> <BR>Some videos are in fact made
    from the laser-subtitled master &#40;resulting in a hard-subtitled video, as the
    anime kinds call them&#41;. Is that where you got the samples-- from a tape?

  body: Joe, <BR>Yes, the samples are from a video of &#34;Vagabonding Images&#34;,
    a 16mm film written and directed by Nicolas Humbert and Simone F&uuml;rbringer,
    released in 1998, distributed by Simnic Films in Munich. <BR>That explains the
    &#34;little blobs at the stroke ends&#34;. Thanks very much for your help! <BR>&#40;Any
    way to find out who designs the fonts?&#41; <BR>Ramon <BR>
