		<div class="commentbody">A couple of alternative fonts to play with might be Beanstalk or BellBottom (BellBottom works well with the name/letters, but it might not go so well with your specific product); otherwise, the typeface you've found could probably work well with some Nickel Pickel specific characteristics. I like this much better than your original type selection. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Try stacking and offsetting the two words, then balancing the design with some simple related graphic element (links, locket, etc</div>
