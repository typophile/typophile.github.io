		<div class="commentbody">Kris, this is a really good start. <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;d agree with David about the E. <BR>There are lots and lots of different <BR>things you can do with an uppercase E. <BR>One thing you can do: Challenge yourself to sketch <BR>out 10-12 different forms and pick from there. <BR> <BR>&#42; The z is nice. The middle sharp part, maybe <BR>you might dip that below the baseline <BR>until it looks just so, and the <BR>same with the O and the round E if you keep it, <BR>and the joins on the N. <BR> <BR>&#42; spacing might look better tighter. <BR>And how would it look stacked? <BR> <BR> <BR>good luck. <BR> <BR>ps, Does your Mom know what you</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some thoughts: <BR> <BR>1&#41; I don&#39;t really care for the TH lig. It reads ok, but seems like added trickery for trickery&#39;s sake. Considering you already have lots of character pumped into your deco letters, plus two lovely swash letters. Do you need the ligature? I think no. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Try opening up the space in the R just a hair. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Your curves &amp; stems look a little mechanical for flowing deco type. <BR>a. Apex of the A <BR>b. Horiz/Vert transition on the B <BR>c. What if the stems had a waist? &#40;optima-ized&#41; <BR> <BR>4&#41; Try the N with flat corners instead of the sharp ones. &#40;more in character with the other letters&#41; <BR> <BR>5&#41; This is a matter of taste, but I&#39;d either go back to a optical monoline, or increase the contrast in your thins. &#40;You may not need to if you add a waist to the stems&#41;. <BR> <BR>Finally, I prefer the top E solution. Don&#39;t let them compete with your lovely swashes. <BR> <BR>All that to say, this is really nice. Bursting with potential. Congratulations! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The alternate E&#39;s are excellent. Each is used in just the right places. Very, very elegant. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s something awkward about the numeral 3 but I&#39;m not sure what it is. My instincts say it&#39;s slightly topheavy or left-leaning but when I examine it closely I&#39;m not so sure. Maybe it&#39;s just too centered and ordinary among all the high and low crossbars. Try giving your 3 and 5 the same center as your 6 and 8. <BR> <BR>tangent: What is this, E&#39;s can&#39;t be round anymore because of the Euro? That&#39;s silly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would also like to applaud the nice work. <BR> <BR>I, too, feel that the numerals, 3-4, seem a little off. I think the &#34;3&#34; feels especially light, because it is positioned next to the &#34;2&#34;, which seems to be the heaviest of the numerals. In fact, try turning the &#34;2&#34; upside down to see if it still feels even &#40;in regard to weight&#41; with the rest of the set. Maybe mix up the order a little to see how each numeral feels. <BR> <BR>Again, great work! <BR> <BR>Aloha, <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Also according to Bringhurst hanging numerals are meant to go with lower case &#40;or small caps&#41;. They don&#39;t work with your all caps face, as you mentioned - probably for this reason.  <BR> <BR>If you made small caps to go with your caps, which might be nice if you want to use this in other contexts, or to sell it commercially, then the hanging figures should be proportioned in size and weight to the small caps. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, in your small showing the E is not as closely spaced to the ligature TH; it should be closer, I think.     </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the business card the word spacing seems to work with this font I would not close it much tighter. The RN in Horne seems a bit tight and have you looked at lowering the middle horizontal stress of the E and on the second E in Elizabeth you could lengthen the bottom horizontal to tighten the space to the TH lig. On the reverse the Us seem a bit high and the Ss could break the baseline a bit further, on the point of word spacing I think the address line should break so that you read Street and not Saint.
