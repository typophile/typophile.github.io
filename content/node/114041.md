    reminder for next time: If you are looking for a typeface, be as specific about
    the source as you can. Don\u2019t say \u2018a TV broadcaster in Quebec\u2019,
    but name the broadcaster (or whatever the source of your sample may be). Usually
    that makes it much easier to dig up additional information. Graphik was an easy
    one, but the harder it gets, the more likely you are to get a quick answer if
    you give us all the details."
