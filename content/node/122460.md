  I thought I'd ask here what laser printer are you using for proofing.\r\n\r\nI've
  been trying to get me an A4 laser printer I can trust for that purpose and it's
  been quite a hassle. I was looking at Xerox Phasers but the toner for those cost
  almost as much as a new one! I was told that emulated post script printers really
  should be avoided and Xerox is just about the only one I found compatible with true
  postcript, so its like I have no choice...\r\n\r\nWhat gear do you use? what's a
  good printer with a relatively cheaper toner?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"

    workflow (RIP once, print many) and used inkjet printers for proofs. They were
    remarkably accurate, both in terms of rendering and color.

    want to see samples from, then order a Test Drive from them for $19.95. You provide
    the test files of your choice.\r\n\r\nI did that when I bought my color laser
    and was really surprised at how bad text looks on some of the big-name brands
    you might think would be the best. I ended up buying a Ricoh because the quality
    on 12-point type was excellent and it has true Postscript 3. The Ricoh black-and-white
    lasers use a Postscript emulator. Doing a Test Drive saved me from making an expensive
    mistake."

  body: "Thanks George! I'm definitely gonna have a look!\r\n\r\nJames, I thought
    the price for the Xeror Phaser was reasonable, the toner was what scared me! But
    then again, I don't really know how long those even last so maybe they're worth
    it...\r\n"
