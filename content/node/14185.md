  labour problems. With the announcement of a new CBA came the announcement of a new
  logo. The old NHL logo is on the left, the new one is on the right. Personally,
  I think the change makes the sheild look a little more trendy but does not really
  change the fact that it does a bad job at portraying hockey. This redesign will
  likeley lead to another redesign soon as I think the new one will get stale more
  quickly than the old one.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    (I''m guessing, but what else could it possibly say?), this would be an obvious
    option: make the slant orthodox, and add some dimensionalization. But of course,
    I''m sure the designers racked their brains to come up with a lot of other good
    stuff that couldn''t compete with the rightness of this.'

  body: I hate the new logo. It looks like all logos created on a computer, gimicy
    and not well thought-out. Its just a retread. What they need to do is hire a designer
    like Mark Simonson to really think what the direction of the NHL should be and
    create a custom mark.

  body: "This is definitely \"better\".\r\n\r\nThe typography is much more solid,
    the slant is, as Nick said, \"more orthodox\".\r\n\r\nWhat is represented here
    is a \"dimensional\" version of the logo set beside the \"non-dimensional/flat\"
    version of the previous. The previous had a \"dimensional\" version as well. It
    might be more appropriate to compare apples to apples (forgive the metaphor).\r\n\r\nThis
    said, if we were to compare the solid color/flat versions of both, how could you
    deny that this is an improvement?\r\n\r\nThere is a lot more to consider than
    the pure aesthetics of the mark. This is where a lot of the \"critique\" conversations
    go awry. We fail to consider the \"big picture\". Does the brief dictate \"improvements\"
    of the previous mark? I would think yes. If so, how far away from its predecessor
    can you afford to stray? Among MANY other things we must consider the brand equity
    invested in the previous mark.\r\n\r\nIf I was to \"assume\" the brief stated
    what I think it may have, I would consider this a success. It speaks to its market
    and it is defiantly a typographic improvement. The addition of the serifs adds
    a more aggressive and forward motion feeling to the mark.\r\n\r\nI won't say that
    I like the aesthetical direction ANY of the major sporting (US considered) identities
    take, BUT considering the market by which they are being consumed -- I believe
    them to be appropriate. I could go into a lengthy stereotyping of how I view American
    sports fans, but that would take all day.\r\n\r\nI also won't say I endorse the
    idea of \"needing a redesign\" for the NHL -- but that is not the debate here.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    I were to look at the previous mark, I think that the typographic changes and
    the change of slant made to the new mark, while leaving the colors and shape of
    the original, would have been a \"more appropriate\" way of proceeding.\r\n\r\nIn
    conclusion I say it is a positive move. Was it necessary? I don't think so.\r\n"

    one?\r\n\r\nI'm with nick. The old NHL was cooler. The reverse angle was always
    a bit out of whack but then so was the NHL. I think they could have made way MORE
    money if they had signed up somebody who does retro style really well to have
    enhanced the old feeling. Then it would have felt like something was really happening
    maybe. Instead we all just go on speculating on the money. Look at oriole stadium.
    Did they do it to make money? Sure! But it's NICE. Fans are loyal to the stadium
    as much as to the Orioles. Logos can be the same way. They can inspire. Not this
    one though.\r\n\r\n"

    they're going with traditional heraldic symbols, they've gone from a \"bend\"

    have been better, the new logo is probably more consistent and appropriate for
    the hockey crowd.\r\n\r\nOne thing that hasn't been mentioned is that the diagonal
