  weight between characters is still a little uneven, and some letters i'm not sure
  about. i was thinking of scrapping the g and starting on a two-story g  (along the
  lines of johnston, akkurat etc.)\r\n\r\ni started by wanting to create a grotesque
  striped down to its simplest form by removing unnecessary terminals. \r\n\r\n<a

  kind of gave up on that concept, as the results were not as legible and appeared
  unbalanced. but i'm not sure whether i should abandon the idea completely? maybe
  have two versions of the face - limbs and amputee grotesque? :)\r\n\r\ni would love
  some feedback or thoughts on the typeface!\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nhank\r\n\r\n"

    of the junctions where the curves enter the stems is needed at least at the bottom
    of b d and u and top of p and q. At the moment they look very congested. If you
    look at Johnston's underground face the curves are very monoline and quite thick
    but there is some thinning. Also some years back a version of Gill sans was used
    in Vogue which featured no thinning at these junctions and the face didn't look
    very good and has since thankfully disappeared. The f is curving the second it
    goes above the x-height, have you thought about a smaller x-height. Try some caps
    and numbers and keep going\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hey guys, thanks so much for your feedback!\r\n\r\n-trevor\r\n\r\noriginality
    is something i find many people get hung up on. i personally do not see it as
    necessary as most. i feel - if something can be improved upon by doing it differently
    it should be done, but doing something differently for the sake of it being different
    is of no worth. experimentation however is a very valid means of looking for improvement
    through the act of trial and error. and this is my interest in type; i wish to
    experiment with type in the hope that i can contribute something valid.\r\n\r\n

    on continuing both variants of the typeface, you're right about the 'a' it just
    doesn't balance. \r\n\r\n-garry\r\n\r\nwow, mercator! what a nice face. i really
    like the top and tail of the lowercase 'a' and i love the number '2' <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Mercator_Tetterode_specimen_p77_6390.jpg\">http://typophile.com/files/Mercator_Tetterode_specimen_p77_6390.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nyou're
    right about thinning the junctions. i wanted to have a reasonably consistent thickness
    of line throughout. johnston sans seems to get away with by connecting junctions
    against the angle of the stem - where as grotesques tend to join the stem in sympathy
    to it's angle (as though the pen continues to draw the stem in one fluid line).\r\nthis
    is seen clearly in the lowercase 'n' - <a href=\"http://www.ltmcollection.org/images/webmax/r1/i00006r1.jpg\">http://www.ltmcollection.org/images/webmax/r1/i00006r1.jpg</a>\r\n\r\ni
    shall bring the junctions in and look into the x-height.\r\n\r\ni'll post my amendments
    when i have made some progress.\r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\n\r\nhank\r\n"

    loose the balance of negative space (inside the circles) between upper and lower
    circles. so the bottom circle maintained dominance (this is a feature about the
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/underground/p22-underground/\">johnston
    double-story g that i find very pleasing</a>). i feel most double-story 'g's sans-serif
    faces to be miss balanced (<a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/GillSans-g-designprocess-1933.jpg\">gills
    sans</a> etc.). akkurat would probably be the closest comparison i can think of
    to what i'm attempting, but i find the 'g' just a little too small. by increasing
    the size of the 'g' and the negative space within the circles (with a dominance
    to the lower.) - i hope to make it fit in better with the grotesk face and make
    it more readable.\r\n\r\nso yeah, the bottom of the g is out of proportion from
    most other sans double-storys, but i'm quite sold on it (and to my eye i find
    it quite comfortable).\r\n\r\nthank you for questioning it!\r\ni might consider
    revising it if it doesn't trial well.\r\n\r\nh"
