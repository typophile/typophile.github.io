    rights to a typeface have been auctioned anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nI'm not
    aware of any previous auctions of specific typefaces, surprised Chank didn\u2019t
    try it. Of course font companies and their libraries have been auctioned before,
    just not on eBay ;-) \r\n"

  body: Did I misunderstand? If you read the fine print, it says that they are auctioning
    off a license to use the font on a limitless amount of CPUs, for one year. They're
    not selling the rights or ownership of the typeface.
