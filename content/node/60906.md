  body: "This almost looks like a mixed font like \"Ransom Note\". The styles are
    not the same or the sizes. I could not find a ransom cyrillic font, but maybe
    this was just done by mixing letters from different fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mike, thank you for your answer. But still it seemed to me that it is some
    special font, not Ransom Note. As for me it associates with some posters from
    the October Revolution in Russia at the beginning of 20th century.
