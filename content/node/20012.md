body: "Hello my friendly typolikers,\r\n\r\nI was wondering - can people copyright
  basic page layouts. If I steal an idea from a site I liked that used rounded rectangles
  as text and pic containers - am I committing a copyright infringment? I'm fairly
  new to design, and know that a simple rounded rectangle has existed since the dawn
  of time. I'm only worried because I know I can directly trace my inspiration to
  one particular site.........\r\n\r\nI don't actually know what I'm trying to say
  - I guess, can a designer put dibs on such a simple concept as placing two rectangles
  side by side with a certain dimensions - and rounded corners.\r\n\r\nSorry - I'm
  sleepy - does anyone know what I mean?\r\n\r\nPeace"

    and taste.

    from fairly tangible sources.....I suppose if I'd come up with this particular
    'style' of layout and someone copied me, I wouldn't bat an eyelid, it's too general
    a concept to lay claim too.\r\nMaybe I've answered my question.\r\n\r\nHow far
    ethically would you take 'nodding in someones direction'??\r\n\r\nAnswers on a
    postcard.\r\n\r\nPeace"

  body: I'd say using rounded corners because another site inspires you is fair, but
    using their code to create an entire layout is wrong.

  body: Adidas wants to trademark its triple stripe to the extent that other companies
    can't put stripes on their clothing (from logo to layout, sorta). I dunno where
    that stands at the moment, nice work for lawyers, though.

  body: "The rounded-corner box has been used and abused since the mid-eighties' desktop
    publishing days.  I certainly don't think anyone can lay claim to it.  I certainly
    would not copy someone else's site and just change the text though.  If you want
    to be a designer, design the site yourself, you might learn something from it--and
    you would feel much better about it too.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Hey'all - thanks for your thoughts.......\r\n\r\n(EDIT - Miss Tiffany, just
    got what you meant...I'm building in Flash so it's all my own figuring of the
    concept. I can image burning in binary hell for straight stealing someones source
    - I hadn't even imaged that went on but I guess it must:S)\r\n\r\nI'm going to
    have to go away and think about this. I spent months working on a wholly original
    concept - only to realise that I needed something much more simple and recognisable
    format-wise. That was the learning bit, binning the almost finished and painstakingly
    manicured thing in the bin. Then I glimpsed the particular site I'm having moralistic
    altercations with, and thought their dispay style was perfect........\r\n\r\nIt's
    really difficult knowing what to do - Ahhh! As we speak, I have I think - solved
    the problem, ace potatos as they say around these parts. Hey - when this is done,
    I'll post the post-uploaded SWF for you to look at, + the link to this other site.
    You'll be my PH paper if you'd be so kind.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nPeace"
