  a one man landscape gardening firm. Im in the process of designing logo and print
  materials. \r\n\r\nThe font should suggest the enjoyable, comfortable garden, possibly
  be playful but not too crazy. It should convey an organic natural and enjoyable
  feeling, but also bring across seriousness and tidieness. It must appeal to private
  homekeepers and hobbyist gardeners ranging from 30-75 but also to other companys.\r\n\r\nAs
  of now Im going with Clearface Gothic but Im not so happy with it because it tends
  to be a bit of a cliche here and also is somehow too simple minded in my eyes. (A
  plus of it being that it's a step up from Hobo wich also tends to get used here.)\r\n\r\nChristian"

    from Umbrella Type after reading your post. It's a bit more organic but has a
    relaxed feel with a touch of playful flare, which may work well for a gardening
    firm.\r\n\r\n"
