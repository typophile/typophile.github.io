  than yet another Garamond revival. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a 9 point from a series by
  Pierre Jannet, done around 1856. The scan is from a predictably wonderful article
  by Ovink in an old issue of Quaerendo, which also happens to have a reference to
  that superb Deberny font that came up in the Javal thread. Apparently there was
  a reaction to all the Didone typography during the bulk of the 19th century, and
  this design was one of the seminal works in the resultant &#34;old-style&#34; revival,
  which was however superceded by Morris&#39;s Arts &amp; Crafts revival soon afterwards.
  Shame, since I think the A&amp;C stuff was somewhat provincial, or at least naive.

    is a bit out of whack as well, no?

  body: 'To me: the &#34;h&#34; is definitely too narrow &#40;although I wouldn&#39;t
    make it the same width as the &#34;n&#34;&#41;, the &#34;n&#34; is fine, while
    the &#34;u&#34; is borderline. As for &#34;y&#34;, that skewed thick arm does
    look funny, but ever since I saw it in that Deberny #17/#18&#42; I&#39;ve actually
    liked it. It seems to be a weight distribution scheme. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif"

    make the &#34;v&#34; symmetrical however. <BR> <BR>The spacing though seems a
    bit loose in spots &#40;although apparently this design was considered tight for
    its era&#41;, but being metal makes it harder to space with consistent tightness.

  body: The foot serifs seem to droop down and to the right. Was Jannet a lefty? Cap
    proportions look eratic, but you&#39;d need to see them all. The punctuation is
    monster &#40;i like it&#41;. Hmmm interesting. I like the even weight and the
    smallish caps. <BR> <BR>Perhaps a Pierre et Pierre revival? One roman, the other
    italic? It has market potential. &#40;though the italic would be twice as wide
    at the roman :-&#41; BTW, does this already have italics with it? <BR> <BR>Randy

    ever even heard the guy&#39;s name. <BR>But although this was a reaction against
    the &#34;constructed&#34; Didone trend, and a revival of a more chirographic past,
    it still looks &#34;synthetic&#34; to me &#40;maybe because they couldn&#39;t
    stray <i>too</i> much from the spirit of that era&#41;, so I don&#39;t think they
    were &#34;digitizing&#34; any handwriting/calligraphy. <BR> <BR>BTW, the caps
    are supposed to be how mid-19th century Frenchies thought the Romans were supposed
    to have wanted to mahe them... Hard to explain - you&#39;d really have to read
    the Ovink article&#40;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>And yeah, I <i>love</i> that hefty apostrophe!

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>You are right. That is a face that needs to be made available.
    <BR> <BR>This is not a criticism, but the entire face seems to be on the condensed
    side, with the exception of the fullish caps; at least the two shown. <BR> <BR>If
    the proof you included was initially 9 point or thereabouts, it seems to me that
    the set would be more than tight enough. I&#39;s be curious to see if the type&#39;s
    condensed &#40;to my eye&#41; feeling is evident at actual size. <BR> <BR>Where
    did you find the showing? I don&#39;t think I have ever run across the name Jannet.
    I will need to take a dig in my pile books. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: Well, its well know here! ;-&#41; It follow the trend started by Perrin. The
    Jannet Italic is very very nice. <BR> <BR>I gave that subject couple years ago
    to my type design students. They have done a strange but nice interpretation of
    it who give a completly different feeling in big size with its angular serifs
    but who still very round in small text size. Saddly no text showing online. <BR>

    I just wonder why nobody has revived any of that stuff &#40;I do know that Ponot/IN

  body: What you mean by  <BR>&#34;the elzevir stuff isn&#39;t really the same as
    Morris&#39;s.&#34; <BR> <BR>For Ponot, Mandel and others, Perrin and Jannet are
    the first revival of Old Style typefaces, long long before Morris and others.
    Just that part of history generally don&#39;t appear on standard Anglo-US typography
    books. <BR> <BR>For Perrin its pretty clear, as described by Ponot in its 2 books.
    He wanted typefaces who by its forms reflect old text he want to publish. 19th
    typefaces don&#39;t fitted well, so he tried to find old typefaces, and used one
    existing old italic, and designed a Roman lc to fit with. Its caps are already
    done to do the titling for his HUGE book on Roman Lyon Inscriptions. I describe
    the Italic as a pure Garalde, when the Roman is more an Incised Garalde, perhaps
    the first text face of the category at this time? <BR> <BR>Perrin was one of the
    first typefaces revival done at the original ANCT &#40;Imprimerie nationale&#41;,
    roughly 1987 by Jean Renaud Cuaz and Ronan Le Henaff under the direction of Mandel.
    Then, later later, the Imprimerie Nationale asked to Franck Jalleau, their in-house
    type designer to do a digital version who is used ONLY in the Ponot book you refer.

    several time, as a French &#34;Gout Hollandois&#34;! <BR>I have here a couple
