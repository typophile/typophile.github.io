  body: "I had similar problems with some programs (I don't recall if FLS was one
    of them) when migrating software. Reinstalling the software generally solved the
    problem. I'd suggest first backing up ~/Library/Application Support/FontLab and
    ~/Library/Preferences/com.fontlab.fontlab5, then deleting the following:\r\n\r\n~/Library/Application
    Support/FontLab\r\n/Library/Preferences/com.fontlab.fontlab5\r\n/Library/Preferences/com.fontlab.licenses.plist\r\n/Library/Application
    Support/FontLab\r\n/Applications/FontLab Studio\r\n\r\nThat way you're doing a
    clean install with no residue left over from your old install. If the problem
    goes away after doing this you can restore your old preferences and any customized
    files you may have created in ~/Library/Application Support/FontLab\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
