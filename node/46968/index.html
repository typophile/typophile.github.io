  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there!
Here i am again, after publishing my stencil font and my mono-spaced i'm thinking now on finishing my "Clarendon" and start a script and a italic font. The problem is like on everything: knowledge.
I'm searching for books easy to get and/or cheap so i can get some notions and learn how is a good letter on script and on italic.

Can anyone help me on this subject?</div>

My father has taken a calligraphy course for a secretary job but the problem is that he lost his books... Books were in bad shape.
I'm not much interested on artsy/craftsy as you said cause 99% of them are bad books. I don't think that beautiful type. Of course, there are exceptions and thats why i'm asking around here.
If you know any of those exceptions and so... see what i mean?

		<div class="commentbody">Most of the books on calligraphy are not worth bothering with, but even if there was a good one it would not be of much use.
The only way to really understand italics, or any pen script for that matter, is by using a broad edged pen or to some extent two pencils taped together. I have been a calligrapher and lettering artist for over 40 years and I am still learning.
Nor wishing to be disrespectful, but to think that it would be possible to design a decent italic font without a reasonable understanding of the characteristics of letters produced with a broad edged pen is expecting too much in my opinion. Seeing decent italics is one thing, understanding them is another.
In my opinion if you want to design a decent italic font, then forget the computer for a while and learn basic calligraphic principles first with a pen in your hand ( might take you a few years though).

There is still a problem, that's why i asked the books, what is a beautiful and well-made letter? I do have to see, learn, and so on...

		<div class="commentbody">You want to see some beautiful italics... check out Palatino Italic, Diotima Italic and Schneider Antiqua Italic.

Diotima and Palatino Italic are the very essence of the female versus the male perspective... designed, oddly enough, by the married team of Gudrun und Hermann Zapf.

Diotima, a supple and graciously curved italic... Palatino, an angular, more masculine, even harsh italic. Both equally beautiful.

Schneider Antiqua is an entity unto itself. A triumph for Werner.
 
Set your sights on these and you will succeed.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok i'll check that out.
Anyway here is the list of books that i have on my basket:

Ogg, Oscar. “Three classics of Italian calligraphy: an unabridged reissue of the writing books of Arrighi, Tagliente, and Palatino”
Fairbanks, Alfred. “A Book of Scripts”
Anderson, Donald M. “A Renaissance alphabet”
Morison, Stanley. “Four centuries of fine printing”

There is only one problem... money! I can't buy them all at the same time

For later buys i have these:
Universal Penman
Anatomy of a Typeface
Masters of the Italic Letter: Twenty-Two Exemplars from the Sixteenth Century 

I love swaches, i love Dino dos Santos Capsa Italic and Andrade Pro Italic but i like ventura and volupia altough. I've just said Dino dos Santos work because i'm familiar to it. About those  that typerror told me to see i liked i liked diotima italic, palatino italic and schneider antiqua italic although still don't have the smooth the swaches i'm interested too. About Zapf work i don't like much, or in other words, i'm not interested on doing those kind of things, at least for now.
Just told you this so you can council me.
So for those who have knowledge of these books and my preferences, please, what do you think I should buy first?

I agree that pen in hand is a better teacher, but a library could get you started. If there are any descent calligraphy classes in your area, that would be better yet as a good teacher can point out structural problems in your forms from the start. Also...have a good look at some Italics that are based soundly on Calligraphic forms such as:

About libraries, unfortunately, i think my country doesnt want much with typography even knowing that we have really good typeface designers, anyway, i've gone to two libraries around a 30km from where i live and nothing about typographie, two books or three on each about graphic design! Unfortunately i can't go by that way, so i'll buy on abebooks, it will cost me like 30e the Three Italian Calligraphers and the Book of Scripts. I think.

About the links, pouty is not the thing i'm looking to do, poetica is more.
Oh , i'm trying to do a custom typeface already:
[[http://typophile.com/node/47032]]

After this made i will start the italic font.
