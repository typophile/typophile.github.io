  project. The project is a book release, an edited compilation of the author's notebooks.\r\n\r\nBecause
  the text comes from handwritten notebooks, and is also written in a conversational
  American vernacular, I've looked for something that suggests \"journal\" without
  being a handwriting font; I've also avoided some of the more customary high-quality
  text fonts I might otherwise use (e.g. Sabon, Trump Mediaeval) holding out for something
  that looks more \"American\", something that might even suggest American transcendentalism
  of the 19th century a la Emerson, Thoreau, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best I've come across
  for these criteria is Whitman. But I'm unhappy with the way Whitman looks at 10.5
  pt.\r\n\r\nSo I'm after something American, journal-like, with probably a relatively
  higher x-height -- but a good text font.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions will earn the tender
  thanks for this poster!"

    mind me asking, can you say more about what exactly is disappointing you about
    its performance at 10.5 pts? (Feel free to contact me offline via the Typophile
    contact form, if you prefer.) \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen a few examples where it was
    used at that size, and I thought it worked well \u2014 although, my personal preference
    is usually 11pts for a typical 6x9 page layout. \r\n\r\nThat aside, from your
    criteria, I wonder if Adobe\u2019s Chaparral (designed by Carol Twombley) might
    suit your project. The character is a little more informal. I\u2019ve seen it
    used to good effect in similar circumstances."
