  body: Probably [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/compacta|Compacta]] and judging by
    the way /K diagonal strokes connect to the vertical via a horizontal bar, either
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/compacta-lt|Linotype]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/compacta|Monotype]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/compacta-sb|Scangraphic SB]] should
    do the job.
