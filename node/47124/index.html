  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Preface:  I have e-mailed Adobe support several times about this, and found them to be useless for what ought to be a ridiculously simple question.  I have also briefly poked around the Adobe site in search of documentation.</em>

What are the codepoints for ornaments in Adobe Caslon Pro?  For example, I am looking for the floral heart (“❦”), which ought to be <code>U+2766</code>, and for the border-drawing characters.  Such characters are displayed in the Adobe store’s glyph complement PDFs for multiple family members, but are not to be found at the proper Unicode points; the PDFs in question are locked down, of course, preventing me from simply doing a plaintext copy into an editor that can tell me which bits are being used.  A quick glance through the PUA reveals nothing, although I really did not waste too much time eyeballing line after line of empty boxes in the chart.  I am not (yet) enough of an OT/PS savant to strip the files apart and search under the hood for what I need.

I have peeked into several family members within Adobe Caslon Pro, OpenType version 2.015 (PostScript outlines), to no avail.

By the way, if there are any Adobe folks watching, what are the chances your Caslon family will see (carefully-extrapolated) additions of more internationalization glyphs?  If so, is there an upgrade path that does not involve repurchasing family members outright?  And dare I even dream of the font family being extended with titling caps at larger optical sizes, and larger or smaller optical sizes for text?

Thanks in advance to all who may render aid—and my thanks to Carol Twombly for reducing Mr. Caslon’s brilliant type to those mathematical imperatives more appropriate for modern usage.

This is the font displayed in FontLab, showing the PUA code.
Hope this helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Prose, if you are using InDesign, the ornaments are accessible through the glyph pallet. By the way, most of these very nice ornaments did not originate with Caslon, according to historian James Mosley . 

According to what I have read, Carol Twombly stopped doing type design some years ago, so there are unlikely to be optical sizes. Originally there was some initial design of a display size, but this seems to have been never completed. 

The text size of my new interpretation of Caslon will, I hope, soon be complete and out from Font Bureau. I have drawn other optical sizes, but completion is further in the future. I haven't planned on doing ornaments.   

Currently for normal book display sizes you have Caslon 540, a good type based on ATF's interpretation, and for very large sizes, you have Matthew Carter's superb Big Caslon.</div>

There are no plans to extend the family significantly in the next few years.

William, whatever you think of it, there is Justin Howes's extremely well-intentioned ITC Founders Caslon, available in several sizes, and there must be additional sizes hanging around because Justin certainly sent me some when I asked for them. 

Justin hadn't got to the point of really knowing anything about fitting before his tragic early death, and ITC at that point had nobody it could afford to call on to help him (one reason ITC was so keen on the release was that it wasn't costing them anything upfront), so the worst problems were fixed by Ilene Stritzver (?) as I recall, with a lot of kerning, which is not the right way to do it. I advised Mark Batty not to release it in its then-form, and was surprised that the specimen book looked as good as it did - - a truly exceptional feat of typesetting.

I understand that George Abrams's Caslon has not been released? George thought it was miles better than Carol Twombley's. I thought it was pretty uninspired, when I saw it. I expect George was the only one of us to possess his own copy of Caslon's famous specimen sheet. He offered to lend it to me. I wonder what he would have done if I had accepted? 

My favourite Caslon is of course the Great Primer (?) -- the appx 18 point - - but that is the weight that owes least to Caslon . . . . this may have been revived by someone under the name 'Couna Caslon' or something like that ? </div>
