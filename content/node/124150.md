  before albums had art:\r\n\r\ncolumbia u.s. (ante CBS) used these fonts on their
  album labels:\r\nas far as i remember, i 've read somewhere that the \"columbia\"
  logo is not actually a font - but please proove me wrong! (usherwood black is somewhere
  near though)\r\n\r\nthe \"masterwork\" is the bigger problem - i can't find either
  a matching font or a clear enough scan for PSing around\r\n\r\nany ideas?\r\n\r\nthx![img:sites/default/files/old-images/1111_5818.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2222_4101.jpg]"

  body: "once again it's don who's lending helping hands big time!\r\nthx!\r\n\r\ncolumbia:
    i was of course thinking of tweaking the usherwood black with some 'rounding'
    effect.\r\n\r\nmasterworks: that would mean i'll have to try combining letters
    from different fonts then as all of them seem to have a unique feature. the panam
    S is a good find! the O could be a zero too?! the W is a rare catch, don't you
    think? but the others won't be any easier to find."

  body: "more info! nice!\r\nthx for all your constant input!\r\n\r\nregarding the
    'columbia' logo: i do find it rather interesting that its look is not entirely
    consistent and changes both within relative short time and also depending on location
    of publication of an album: south america, australia, france us, uk, italy; differences
    are small and seem to move back and forth.\r\nmy guess is that corporate identity
    was not as strict as it is today and outcome depended on whatever print shop was
    hired for a certain job.\r\n\r\nplease do also lay your focus on \"masterwork\"
    - i didn't find a solution how to tweak my way to a good result yet\r\n\r\n:)"
