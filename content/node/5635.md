body: For the end credits of my new movie, I need to know who the designer of ITC
  Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed is. MyFonts names Morris Fuller Benton first but
  also credits David Berlow and Victor Caruso. Was either of the latter individually
  responsible for the EC font, or was that part of the original Benton design?

    solo, but it&#39;s too long ago and I haven&#39;t got anything  <BR>to double-check
    my recollections with. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Did Hoffmann do the condensed version, or is that a Spiekermann design? Guess
    I could ask him, but wow, what a minefield I&#39;d be walking into.

  body: Well, the 1908-1927 makes me believe Hoffmann did all  <BR>the versions, as
    I&#39;d find it highly unlikely he&#39;d have spent  <BR>19 years designing say
    the basic non-condensed weights.

    no, it&#39;s the Berthold
