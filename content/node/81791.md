  to know, briefly, what do you like and what you dislike from the typeface sales
  website. In fact, in your opinion what are the strengths and weaknesses of the sites
  you visit. The site name is not required, simply indicate, for example: \u201CI
  love when I can test several character heights\u201D or \u201CI hate if I have to
  go through another site to buy a font or I should wait one to two days before receiving
  the family bought\u201D.\r\n\r\nAgain, the site name is not required. Thank you
  in advance.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "My main complaint has been where renderings are obscured with patterns, watermarks,
    etc. in order to prevent people swiping the settings. When you think about it,
    it makes no sense, and reduces the appeal/accuracy of the font.\r\n\r\nAnd one
    thing I'd like to see [more] is the ability to compare fonts side-by-side (at
    least in the case of font houses with large libraries).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I want to know the price up front. Don't make me add a font to my basket just
    to see how much it is. I have given up on a purchase, not because the font was
    too expensive, but just because I was irritated.

  body: "I like to see PDFs and/or have a type tester that goes large. (And agree
    with Hrant about squiggly patterns.)\r\n\r\nI like to be able to buy just the
    weights I need. I like an assortment of bundles.\r\n\r\nI like clear, straightforward
    web design.\r\n\r\nI like to see who designed something, what their rationale
    was, and how they realised their concept.\r\n\r\nI like tags rather than categories.
    And the facility to view similar fonts (though I've never seen this implemented
    very intelligently).\r\n\r\nI like ones where you can send a question to a real
    person.\r\n\r\nI don't like having to wade through hundreds of rubbish offerings
    that are not really commercial quality. Apart from getting in the way, they also
    make you wonder whether the stuff you're interested in is actually good enough
    quality (spacing, kerning, glyph sets, hinting, opentype features)."

    how it has a price tag far beyond what your willing to pay."

  body: I like to be able to see and test all alternates, and to read something about
    the face and designer. I like downloadable PDF specimens. I would really like
    to see more often the option to buy all optical sizes of a single weight as a
    package, with an appropriate bulk discount. Sometimes choosing these manually
    ends up costing more than the complete package with all sizes and weights. (I
    rarely use bold, but often need optical sizes of the normal weight roman and italic.)
    Thus, websites that do not do the above things can be annoying.

    that's really quite a nice site. Only thing that bugs me there is that you've
    put lights with bolds and mediums with heavies; if I were buying a set I'd probably
    want medium with bold. Looking at Moraine, The contrast between Medium and Heavy
    is a bit much for me and I'd go for the Extrabold, I think. Also, I don't understand
    why all the font sets appear three times \u2014 is my browser playing up?"

    to pick out your own four font set, you get the same discounted price. The same
    goes for any combination of 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, or 20.

  body: "Clear pricing, and big PDF samples in a wide variety of sizes, with at least
    several paragraphs at each size. I want to be able to print things out, on paper,
    and look at them.\r\n\r\nAlso, when buying a set offers a substantial discount
    over individual fonts, I'd really like the cost of buying one font to be put toward
    the overall price of the set if I buy a set. I can see \"gambling\" to buy a basic
    weight of one font, roman, and then testing it myself in print. And if I like
    it, getting other weights, italics etc. \r\n"

  body: PDF samples are a big bonus. Sometimes I print them out, but mostly, I just
    download them as a type of bookmark that I will run across in my files to remind
    me of a font I want to buy. That way, I don't have to make my way back to your
    site to remember that I love a certain font.

    weight or a set, to complete with other weights/complementary sets.\r\nI'd like
    to see more clearly the opentype features implemented and be able to test-drive
    them. \r\nI hate when the <em>glyphs table</em> (character set) doesn't show alternate/OT
    specific glyphs. \r\nI also hate when the <em>supported languages</em> list is
    not present and I like to filter my search by supported language. "

    I\u2019m not sure about how it could be implemented, given the different naming
