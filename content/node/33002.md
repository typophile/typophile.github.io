body: "What is letterspacing?\r\n\r\nHow do you kern letters 'by eye'?\r\nJim Krause
  in  'Type Index' on page 90 says to 'try focusing on sets of three (adjacent) letters
  at a time;'\r\n'squinting helps accentuate \"dark spots\" and \"holes\" within the
  word-'\r\n\r\n'Thinking in Type' by Alex White on page 365 says to flip a headline
  upside down so it's shapes become noticeable or by imagining equal amounts of water
  poured between characters.\r\nIn the example he gives he has the spaces between
  letters as grey on the x height of the letters. So you are supposed to compare unequal/strange
  shapes.\r\nHe uses 'Avelas' as an example.  I am not sure why he doesn't include
  the ascender or rather the parts of the letter that extends past the x height in
  the equal spacing calculation. Why does he not include the bowls and the negative
  space of the letters in the calculation (e.g. the 'A' has a space - the 'counter')?
  He provides a chart of most significant kerning pairs on page 364.\r\n\r\n'Av'\r\nWould
  equal spacing be optically okay spacing? If you measured from the 'A' to the lowercase
  'v' would that be the same for all letters?"

    but the three letters you\u2019re working on. Space them evenly. Slide the paper
    over one letter. Repeat. After you get them all, pull aside the cover sheets and
    tweak by looking at the letters as a whole."

    and the eye uses rods which discern black, white and grey. The aim is that you
    don\u2019t see dark or light groups but a generally even grey. \r\nSince you cannot
    (well you can, but not easily in running text) alter the shapes of the letters
    you have to accept the counters and work on the spaces between them, all the while
    bearing in mind that you don\u2019t want to affect the readability of your piece
    (so, for example, you have to accept that an rn combination is going to have an
    open space and by closing it you will raise the chances of it being read as an
    m).\r\nOptically even does not equal mathematically even, so your Av sample wouldn\u2019t
    hold true, for example, Av might need loosening while ve might need closing.\r\nI
    suspect that practical experiment, as in so many things, is better than reading
    about it.\r\n\r\nTim"

    is a lot of truth to this, but as with most things aesthetic, you need to consider
    the audience. What \"I\" like can matter to an artist, what \"the audience\" likes
    should matter to a designer.\r\n\r\nAs to letterspacing & kerning, Bill is right,
    fashion changes. But I would say that you cannot get good spacing (kerning or
    letterspacing) mathematically. Worse, I believe you can't use the same values
    for all sizes --  what works for a 10-point setting will not look right at a 36-point
    setting. Notice the word \"look.\" Best I can do; it is why you have to kern by
    eye (with the other eye on the audience)."

    changes in the spacing of Palatino, caused by changes in time & technology. As
    the old type is still available (somewhat), I take it as a change in fashion.
    I do agree with you about an ideal spacing for a particular font in a particular
    situation, but am also aware I come from a particular background, and am fast
    becoming a dinosaur.\r\n\r\n<cite> edit</cite>\r\n\r\nFor example, & from that

  body: "Well, Charles, I have a feeling we agree on this. I don't think that the
    tight spacing of caps is a good idea, when they are set as all caps. I think Briem
    feels the same way--which is what I gather from the tone of his comment. \r\n\r\nThe
    type designer has the problem that if the caps are spaced well for matching the
    lower case they are probably too tight ideally for the uppercase only setting.
    On the other hand, if they are set larger, in headings, and then they should be
    tighter than if smaller. So the usual decision is to design the spacing to match
    the lower case, and leave it to the type setter to adjust all caps. I don't know
    of a better solution.   "

    as a feature when the \"All Caps\" mode is selected? This would require that the
    user invoke the \"All Caps\" setting from the menu though, even if the characters
    were typed as all caps to begin with.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    although the eye can discern black and white in low-light, mostly you see shades
    of grey, while losing the sharp edges where characters meet spacing. With a black
    on white headline by squinting you should be able to compare the lighter inter-letter
    grey patches and easily pick up areas whether they are dark or light. Depending
    on size and use, you would normally close up the large light areas and open up
    the dark areas so that the areas are equal(ish), bearing in mind that you don\u2019t
    want to reduce (or increase) the inter-letter space to such an extent that it
    hinders reading. 90pt at arms length might be too close/big to get the effect.
    \r\nIt doesn\u2019t work for all, an alternative might be to look at it upsidedown.\r\n\r\n>\u201C90\u201D
    looks ugly in this case?\r\nOr does it clearly differentiate between the numerals?
    Which is more important, harmony between characters or the message they carry?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Watch out for light/dark balance onscreen; it's not the same as on paper.
    Light-emitting, low-res monitors give a very different impression, halation is
    actually an issue. But you certainly can use photoshop, or your eyes, to approximate
    a blurred view of type, and that is useful for finding light or dark spots in
    the overall texture. Older techniques: print a sample large, then walk all the
    way across the room to look at it. Or, get a reducing glass and look through that.
    \r\n\r\nI think what's crucial about the idea of letting the eye be final arbiter,
    is that so many people prefer to rely on logical rules and formulas of one kind
    or another, and the more you rely on some kind of logic, the less you are seeing
    the actual fit of a typeface. The eye is what will be using the type in the end.
    It's like designing a chair. Coming up with an elaborate rationalization and concept
    for why a chair will be comfortable is no substitute for sitting in the damn thing
    to test it out. We use these tools with our bodies. The smoother, more comfortable
    they are, the easier it is to use them subconsciously and do our work (or reading
    or dining). "
