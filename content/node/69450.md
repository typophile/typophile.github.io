  named Duodecimo. It was at least available during the early to middle 1800s. A serif
  typeface used in book printing and was available in the United States.\r\n\r\nIf
  this exists in a digital font that would be interesting to see a sample or link
  of.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any insight into this typeface anyone might have.\r\n\r\nThanks
  much,\r\nJM"

  body: "In the early to middle 1800s, typefaces generally didn't have names as such.
    They were commonly named by the type size and sometimes the general style.\r\n\r\nThe
    word \"Duodecimo\" in printing refers to a particular size of book, printed with
    12 pages per sheet. In context, \"duodecimo typeface\" would probably refer to
    whatever particular typeface a given printer chose to use for books of that page
    size. One printer's \"duodecimo typeface\" would very likely be different from
    the next, and a given printer might have more than one \"duodecimo typeface.\"\r\n\r\nUnless
    you can name a specific book, my prediction is that it will be impossible to determine
    a single typeface that <em>uniquely</em> fits that description. However, it might
    not be too difficult to come up with one or more candidates.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks for the clarification. I thought that name sounded like a printing
    term a may have heard some time ago.\r\n\r\nThe specific book it was used in was
    the first printed edition of the Book of Mormon. Egbert B. Grandin was the printer/publisher
    and John H. Gilbert was the typesetter. It was printed in 1830 in Palmyra, NY.
    Below are some scans of a potential original edition I found online.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4495.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/9_6507.jpg]"

    of them, many being knockoffs of knockoffs of\u2026 You won\u2019t find a perfect
    match because these designs are products of the printing and paper of their time,
    and tended to have some flaws that aren\u2019t revived today, but if you want
    a really nice scotch look at Matthew Carter\u2019s Miller."

    most certainly is not. Scotch Modern is a different style of typeface, derived
    from the Scotch, that appeared decades after the publication of that book. Nick\u2019s
    source for Scotch Modern is from 1873!"

    the original poster is looking for something that is redolent of the 1800s and
    has the feel of the \"products of the printing and paper of their time,\" as you
    eloquently put it, then Scotch Modern is a better match than Miller."
