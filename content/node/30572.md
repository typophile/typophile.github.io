  body: Try the search function; I believe there has been a thread or two with quotes
    from typographers and about typography in general. No idea if they contain anything
    about Garamond, but you can check.

  body: 'I don''t know about quotes, but just about everything you can safely say
    about the life and work of Garamond (or Garamont if you prefer) is in John Lane''s
    essay on ''Claude Garamont and his roman type'' which is in the specimen that
    Adobe put out in 2005 with the title <em>Garamond Premier Pro: A Contemporary
    Adaptation</em>. I don''t know how you get it, but it''s a stunning piece of historical
    work, very well illustrated, and in English too.'

    some rights issues that prevented Adobe from placing a verison on-line. Best bet
    would be to contact Tom Phinney or David Lemon directly. \r\n\r\nRick, to increase
    your chances of snagging a copy you could ask them for a copy for your school
    library. "
