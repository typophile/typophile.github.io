body: Are we in need for new digital fonts that communicate to the culture of today?
  Or are we in need of revisiting the organization of typography as a craft, concentrating
  more on the universal truths and style we already obtain?

    \u201CDon\u2019t we already have enough fonts?\u201D into academese).\r\n\r\nThe
    purpose of design is to resolve conflicting parameters.\r\nYou <strong>can</strong>
    have it all, or else settle for second best\u2014revivals, retreads and clones.\r\n\r\nIf
    you think there are universal truths and style, you\u2019re not thinking like

  body: "It's true that new typefaces are harmless, and like new popular songs, someone
    might like any given new typeface.\r\n\r\nBut while that means the creative endeavor
    of producing new typefaces should not be <em>suppressed</em>, the question of
    whether or not we <em>need</em> new typefaces can be thought of in another sense:
    by how much should the creation of new typefaces be <em>encouraged</em>? Just
    how <em>urgently</em> do we need more of them?\r\n\r\nI think that if we look
    at the word \"need\" from that point of view, while most new typefaces will, even
    if they're worthwhile and well-done, vanish into obscurity, there will still be
    the occasional typeface that does fill a void.\r\n\r\nOne obvious example is the
    much-overused and much-criticized typeface Papyrus, which I've noted fills a void
    as an inoffensive typeface which suggests something foreign and exotic but in
    a way that is not likely to draw criticism for cultural insensitivity, the way
    simulation faces are likely to do.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the electronic digital
    computer, display faces based on, or inspired by the MICR numerals, hideous and
    inappropriate as they might seem, were still \"new\" typefaces that could not
    possibly have been waiting there to be used in a 1923 font catalog.\r\n\r\nAnd
    then there are the creative successes that don't meet a \"need\", as such, but
    are original enough to demand attention. Bifur, Lydian, Optima and Peignot come
    to mind. So does Times Roman, although now there's the controversy about Starling."
