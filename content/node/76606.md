    some tiny tweaks, suits alot better than the modified Didot/Bodoni bastard face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/upmenow_4178.JPG]\r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions? "

    when printing problems arise, like uniforms etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logomark_4496.JPG]\r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions, I'm still rough with the curves, but this seems to be the best practice
    for me.\r\n\r\nMat."

  body: I like the ring of swash. Was there any intention of looking like the wooliness
    of the source of mutton? They also look like a pie-crust. They need tidying up
    but don't make them too geometric or it might look like an old phone dial.

  body: "Ahhh yeah thanks for pointing that out, that wasn't intended. As long as
    I don't play on it too much I think it would be nice for someone to make their
    own from it. \r\n\r\nYeah thanks for that, phone cord is the last thing I was
    after, I'll watch out for that!\r\n\r\nMat."

  body: "As a plan, it's a decent layout. But you clearly need a lot more practice
    in drawing attractive curves from scratch. Here's what I think are your best curves:\r\nThe
    connection from N to &.\r\nThe third loop from the right, and the arcs connecting
    it to its neighbors.\r\nThe loop just above the N (though composition-wise, it
    may be too close to the N).\r\nIn the monogram, the loop just under the right
    side of the M.\r\nThe rest are hard to rank, sinking into the category of \"oh
    dear.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important thing, though, is that your thins are <em>much</em>
    too thin. Swashes need to harmonize with what they're connected to. So look at
    the lightest connecting strokes in the Hoefler Text Italics, such as between the
    t's or inside the u, and never let a stroke get much lighter than that. (And,
    heh, sorry, I'm picturing the look on a screen-printer's face when you say, \"oh
    yes, this one is for when printing problems arise\" and you give him a design
    which, at five inches tall, contains strokes literally as thin as a human hair.)\r\n\r\nSome
    kind of regularity or consistency in the loops is called for. Pick a point, not
    necessarily the center, and make sure the axis, from crossing to tip, of each
    of the loops in a row is pointing to it, like one-point perspective. Perhaps,
    since there's room above \"Mutton\", the loops could get progressively larger
    from left to right. That would have something of the look of a cornucopia, which
    is appropriate for a restaurant."

  body: "Thanks alot for this cerulean, thanks for your honesty. Seems something that
    lecturers at my university are hard up to give. I'll take all you have brought
    up into consideration and come back tomorrow with something hopefully not \"oh
    dear\"! :)\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to learn how to translate my curves from paper
    to mac, I have read some medicore tutorials on the subject, but still it's proving
    hard. It seems i'm missing something about the pen tool! \r\n\r\nThanks for the
    cornucopia reference also.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking for some kind of reference,
    tutorials for the drawing of elegant curves.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nMat."
