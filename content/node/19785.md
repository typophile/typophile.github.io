body: "Hi everybody!\r\ni'm working on my graduation thesis and i had to start from
  the book that me and other guys redesigned and illustrated.\r\nwe worked on \"Flatland\"
  by Edwin Abbott.\r\nStarting from here i'd like to work on layered type and i'd
  like to create a font family that could be readable only by overlapping the different
  types with different colours.\r\nNow i'm searching information about something similar
  but i found only the Layered type created by some students of an underware workshop
  (http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=Helsinki_Lahti_10_2002&id2=01&id3=basic)
  and the YMC type bythe Dainippon Type Organization (they are owner of a website
  but it's all in Japanese...)\r\nDo you know something else that could be useful?\r\nThanks
  a lot!!\r\nTommaso"

    Font</a> is 6-layered, so to speak. \r\nLayering is good for security and demonstration
    purposes. More, I do not know.\r\nIf the 6 fonts are given different colors,  overlaps,
    swashes and ligatures could be fantastically demonstrated. If one or more fonts
    is whitened, the writing could be secured. The more the whites, the higher the
    security?!\r\nHappy Layering with <a href=\"http://www.crAUSwords.com/flowers/WFlowers.htm\">Flowers</a>"
