  is the first: RUDE RAMS....I have been looking for days and days w/o luck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  is the next one. Its called MARKER ACCT.AK.REV.D and is included in a Gerber Scientific
  Products stencil plotter/cutter, but the font is nowhere else to be found. I can
  use something close, but that has turned useless as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a ton!\r\n\r\nScott\r\n\r\nafterburnerdecals@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RR_4608.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marker_6396.jpg]"

  body: Mike F or Renko may confirm this but I think the one from the image below
    is Sanford (came from Silver Graphics, long defunct). Here is a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?search%5Bquick%5D=sanford">MyFonts
    search</a> with more info.

    know, you ID'd so much which I never would have \u2026\r\nSo Scott, you better
    believe this man. He is almost never wrong. "

    unical that comes close, same for marker. I can draw them by hand in Corel, but
    I really hate that. Why can't they stick to Amarillo USAF? \r\n\r\nAny more leads
    are hugely appreciated!"

  body: "I think the RUDE RAMS lettering looks like a blend of a Chancery style, like
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-zapf-chancery/\">Zapf Chancery</a>
    (which is pretty close) or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cataneo/\">Cataneo
    Swash</a>, with the M from a Mediaeval font like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/omnia/\">Omnia</a>.
    Apply a little customizing of the terminals to make the look unified, and voil\xE1.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I think both fonts come from a comic book lettering background, possibly Blambot
    or Comicraft.

    just can't get access to it grrrr. Same with that marker font. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrawing

  body: "Ahh ... I should have gotten this one. That 'A', though, was leading me in
    the freebie or, as Yves said, the comic lettering direction. But nay ...\r\n\r\nFreehand
    was a pre-1912 ATF typeface. I know of three digital versions, but the most readily
    available would be Nick Curtis's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/duly-noted-nf/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Duly Noted</a>.\r\n\r\nOh, and I want to add a definite confirmation
    that the other font is, as Marcelo stated (and ought to get credit for) Silver
    Graphics' 'Sanford'."
