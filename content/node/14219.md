body: "Here's an ambigram I sketched while at TypeCon last weekend. I talked with
  my professor (John Langdon) about it and deemed it a good start but not a perfect
  finish. I learned a lot from the progression of it from my original sketch (there
  were about 3 revisions). Time to move on and do more sketching. I did come up with
  what John considers quite an excellent alternate for an a/r combo that he had never
  seen before (doesn't fit this style though) and I attached that as well, it'll surely
  go into my library for future use! Comments? critiques at this point aren't so important,
  just thought I'd share some of my type work with everyone!\r\n\r\n-Dave"

  body: "David,\r\nthe DARA ambigram is completely readable and interesting in that
    the \"A\" treatments are very different from each other yet they are separated
    by only one character.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm goin' to fly kites on vacation!"

  body: 'Norber: Thanks for the comment, I was waiting to see what some of you thought
    on the general letter forms and such. I do a lot of sketching of typefaces and
    I think it''s started to help me form my own letters that are readable and still
    solve the problem!'

  body: "I think your AR combination might work better if you closed the counter in
    the middle and put a curve on the inside of the vertical stroke where it joins
    the horizontal (I hope this makes sense, it is very hard to describe parts of
    letters that can be viewed from 180 degrees).\r\nTim"

    if I ever come across this combination again I'll remember your suggestion. Which
    direction are you saying the curve should go on the vertical stroke?\r\n\r\n-Dave "

    idea and make it work.

  body: "<em>David, great work. I applaud anyone that can wrap their cranium around
    this idea and make it work.</em>\r\n\r\nMy inspiration comes entirely from John's
    work, he's nothing less than inspirational. John is perhaps one of the most knowledgeable
    people about letterforms and type that I know in person and to be deemed the 'Ambigram
    Master' by so many, who could ask for a better teacher!? He's been my motivation
    for what now is becoming a love for type and he enjoys the fact that I'm really
    getting into it. I get to help out with some of his work like mentioned before
    which is also exciting!\r\n\r\nI've linked my very first 3 ambigrams I did for
    John's class open ended final if anyone's interested. He enjoyed them very much
    for their different styles and solutions:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dsinelab.net/dave/baileyambigram.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dsinelab.net/dave/davidambigram.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dsinelab.net/dave/daveambigram.html\r\n\r\n-Dave"

  body: John is truly amazing. I can't and wouldn't disagree with that. Having run
    into his book years ago and also trying to inspire my own students I know how
    difficult it is and how loose you mind must be to see in that way. I really that
    first one a lot, Dave.

    second version this fall! Don't forget to go pick up a copy! I know I'm going
    to be getting one and making him sign it no doubt.\r\n\r\n<em>I really that first
    one a lot, Dave</em>\r\n\r\nThanks!! I love that one too, it's so simple but I
    love the style I chose and the actual letterforms."

  body: "If I refer to the A, the curve I suggested would be in the same direction
    as the outside curve from the vertical to the horizontal in the top right, you
    will have to balance the curve so it works with the other curve inside that counter.
    The reason I made the suggestion is that it looked a bit abrupt having a right
    angle. Of course you might decide that it will affect the readability of the R
    shape too much.\r\nTim"
