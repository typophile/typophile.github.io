body: "Just watched an interesting [[http://vimeo.com/forrestmedia/the-history-of-typography|animation]]*
  about the history of typography where the creator tells that typography was invented
  by Gutenberg. Is this correct? The creator also mentions that the first sans-serif
  fonts were created by William Caslon's great-grandson Caslon IV who disliked serifs.
  I'm very curious to know about the accuracy is this information, so any insight
  about this would be appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n*[[http://vimeo.com/forrestmedia/the-history-of-typography|http://vimeo.com/forrestmedia/the-history-of-typography]]"

    Chinese printer Bi Sheng. This isn't necessarily the only definition of typography,
    and doesn't preclude that Gutenberg too may have \"invented\" typography, even
    if he wasn't the first.\r\n\r\nThe first sans serif (latin) type appeared in a
    Caslon family catalogue, so the second anecdote sounds plausible. Sans serif <em>lettering</em>
    was around quite a bit earlier."

    a bit slack, true, and there are some vast generalisations but it's just a bit
    of fun. And quite nicely done I think.
