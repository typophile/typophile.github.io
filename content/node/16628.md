  body: "Earth seems to be a \"hack\" redraw of the typeface used for \"Road Rated\".
    Notice how the external curves of the \"a\" are softer in the original. \r\nThe
    font is also used by Castelli: http://www.castelli-us.com/"

    version.\r\nEarth is an \"old\" face (you can see it in the Solotype Catalog).\r\n"

  body: Indeed, "Earth" may be an old typeface, but I question the accuracy of the
