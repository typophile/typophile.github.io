<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone know which Garamond would look best in the following books: 1) a detective story; 2) a historical fantasy novel for children. <br>I intend to use my Bitstream collection which has the Bitstream versions of Stempel Garamond, Garamond #3 and Sabon. <br> <br>I don't like very thin fonts such as digital Bembos. <br> <br>What kind of printer should I have in order to see the fonts exactly as they will look in the final result (=book)? I think the printer should be able to emulate Postscript or something. <br> <br>Or should I forget Garamonds and use something else, such as ITC New Baskerville or Minion which I also have? (Although Minion looks condensed, intended for narrow columns only and perhaps too modern). How about Trump Medieval (Kuenstler 480) or Bitstream Kis? Please help.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Well, maybe not "know" and "best" - at most "think" and "good". :-) <br> <br>For a detective story I think any Garamond would look somewhat awkward (although few people would actually complain explicitly). What to use instead: could you give more details, like more info about the story, how long it is, etc.? <br> <br>Garamond is more appropriate to historical topics, but then you have to say what target age it's for - because below about 10 years of age children don't read very immersively, so something like ITC Garamond (shudder) would actually be good. <br> <br>The printer: more than imaging language, <i>resolution</i> is your biggest concern. From what James Montalbano has said, on a "desktop" you can only get a true idea of the final result by using a 2400 dpi laser (because the lower the resolution the more gain in the letterforms, throwing off the color and texture). If that can't happen, you might do some early testing of one key page directly on lino/velox, then work "semi-blindly" from there - pretty normal procedure anyway. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Aku, <br>Are you asking which of the faces you already have to use or are you asking what is the best solution for the job at hand? If the latter then we need to know more about the storyline, place time, etc. (as Hrant mentioned above). <br>In my opinion, the actual typeface used for the body text has less to do with conveying the intent of the subject matter than the display fonts selected and how the typography is designed on the page. Those of us here on this list are far more likely to be sensitive to typographic nuances than the average mystery novel reader so you can choose a good neutral text face with good readability from your collection and focus your design abilities on the front matter, chapter dividers, and cover to convey the meaning of the content. <br> <br>ChrisL</div>

<div class=commentbody>The detective story is actually an old-fashioned soap opera set in current time, yes it has a killer but no detective. It is targeted for the middle-aged and elderly. It is not very long. In front of me I have an old UFO book "Sky people". It is set "in 12 on 13 point Intertype Baskerville". Looks very clear to my eye. Yes, no Garamond for the detective story - perhaps 11/14 point ITC New Baskerville would do the trick? <br> <br>I intend to use the faces I already have. However, if you experts come out with a clearly superior choice, I could reverse my decision. I am a spineless weakling! <br> <br>The historical novel is targeted for girls of 9-12 years. It is set in ancient Egypt of the pharaohs but with time travel. How about Zapf Calligraphic 801 (=Palatino) for this - it would be easy to read but would it be boring too? Do boys and girls prefer the same fonts? <br> <br>Just for curiosity - what you would choose for: <br>1) Farewell my lovely (by Raymond Chandler) <br>2) Pet sematary (by Stephen King) <br>3) Space Odyssey 2001 (by Arthur C. Clarke) <br>4) pocket size biography of a fashion designer <br> <br>Thanks! Aku</div>

<div class=commentbody>The detective story: Baskerville is certainly a great "adult" (no, not that kind :-) face for a short novel. Maybe a bit too "rational", but if it smells like a detective story then maybe just right. Which cut of Baskerville? That's where the usage experts are needed... <br> <br>The historical novel: Palatino might actually be very fitting, since its somewhat large x-height (compared to its more bookish sister, Aldus) might be just the thing for the transition from non- to immersive reading. The main problem with Palatino though is that it's too common. So maybe Trump or Kis would indeed be better overall, although you'd have to set them a bit big (like 12). <br> <br>> Do boys and girls prefer the same fonts? <br> <br>There might actually be some empirical evidence about this, but: <br>- It will be hard to locate. <br>- It's unlikely to be very reliable. <br> <br>I wouldn't get that detailed in font choice "context" if I were you - it's quicksand. <br> <br>> what you would choose for: .... <br> <br>Hey, I could waste <i>days</i> on that... :-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>For historical fiction, why not a typeface that is itself an historical fiction? <br> <br>By that I mean one that is not a revival, but done in the style of a bygone era. <br> <br>And depending on how much anachronism there is in the story, that could effect the decision also. <br> <br>For instance, Storm's "Sebastian" is an anachronistic historical fiction -- a sans serif from the 18th century -- so would be suitable for stories involving modern gadgets "time-transported" into the past.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Imagine that, somethink Nick and I actually agree on. <br> <br>Indeed, if the typeface choice doesn't need to resonate with its content in any way, we wouldn't need more than a handful of functional typefaces in the world. <br> <br>I believe that the typeface choice shouldn't *get in the way* of the content, but that doesn't mean it can't *enhance* the content.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for interesting answers. I still wonder should I tinker with the tracking setting in Indesign. My understanding is that if I use the default tracking (zero value), the body text will be much too tight for languages other than English.

<div class=commentbody>Well, for example Berthold offers special BQ versions of many fonts. According to Berthold's web site: <br>"The Berthold BQ and Adobe Berthold versions are derived from the same data source and so the character outlines are almost identical. The metrics (spacing and kerning) will differ considerably as the Berthold BQ versions have extended kerning for European languages (German, French, Italian etc.)." <br>(Obviously English is not considered an European language by Berthold). <br>This could be just sales talk, but if it isn't, then I should either buy the BQ version or increase the tracking? <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>At the risk of being pedantic and disrupting the thread, this is the correct designation, as it appears on passports, etc. <br> <br>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick is right - Northern Ireland is the difference between Britain and the UK. <br>(Not 'North Ireland', though, as that would include bits of the Republic of Ireland. The wording is opposite to the difference between 'South Africa' and 'Southern Africa', but in both cases, one is a specific political area, so the other refers to a geographical area). <br> <br>Oh sh1t - now I've been pedantic <i>and</i> disrupted the thread. <br> <br></div>
