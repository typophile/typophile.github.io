  discussions here.\r\n\r\nI'd like to share a concept logo of 'one', derived from
  the digits 2 and 3. Any suggestions to improve this..?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/one_4800.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank

    problems reading it as \"one\" at first glance but as soon as I figured it out,
    I started liking it a lot."

  body: "simplicious-\r\n\r\ni was thinking the same thing about the E...except perhaps
    doing that really does make it read as an E and not a 3. i don't think we'll know
    til we see it. but then choosing a different font may solve the problem also--which
    could probably be done since it appears to me the 2 and the 3 are from different
    worlds; one is pointy, one is soft.\r\n\r\ni actually read one immediately, the
    1-2-3 didn't present itself to me. maybe i shouldn't have read the text above,
    but then, maybe i shouldn't have to.\r\n\r\ni do think it's clever & there's definitely
    something to this."

  body: "I was looking at it again and must admit that I'm still stunned by the idea
    but there are some details that makes it too much \"2\" and \"3\" and too little
    \"one\".\r\n\r\nTo make it \"one\" as well as \"2\" and \"3\" I'd suggest you
    to first take \"2\" and \"3\" and positioning them the way you want them and then
    overlay them with \"O N E\" to tweak the numbers into letters.\r\n\r\nSince it's
    a little hard to explain I've prepared a little mock-up. Hopefully you don't mind
    since it's just for explanation and showing you what I mean. In this case I choose
    Avenir 95 since it's very geometric and has some nice numbers but I think that
    you can use this technique for any kind of typeface.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps
    you. Keep on going and I think you will end up having a great logo.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/contours_3981.jpg]\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/one_4427.jpg]"

  body: "Firstly, thank you for the positive comments. Humbled. \r\n\r\n@Evanbrog:
    You're spot on when you deduced by sheer observation that the two digits were
    from different worlds. The 3 was a nondescript Impact, if I remember correctly,
    while the side-laying 2 was conjured. Personally, I did not notice the pointy-soft
    subtle differences in the two digit-'types', so it was a lesson learnt. Thank
    you.\r\n\r\n@Simplicious: It is interesting that Evanbrog saw 'ONE' and you saw
    '2-3'. That both means that the logo is not quite successsul as the balance between
    form and function was not, er, balanced. \") Your take on a different '3', and
    then the execution of an alternative logo is very, very appreciated. I agree that
    the lopsided-bottom heavy '3' eschewed the reading of an E. Your version kind
    of wrapped up the logo nicely. The concept is similar, but that end product: breath-taking.
    Not sure if there could be any improvement to be added. \r\n\r\nthank you,\r\nnagfa\r\n\r\n"

  body: The top-heavy E made certain sense because "one" was read left-to-right, "two"
    - bottom-to-top, 90 degrees ccw relatively to "one" and then "three" - right-to-left,
    in another 90 degree turn.

    left-to-right, \u201Ctwo\u201D - bottom-to-top, 90 degrees ccw relatively to \u201Cone\u201D
    and then \u201Cthree\u201D - right-to-left, in another 90 degree turn.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    exactly what I was thinking, but then I started to realize that this might be
    the reason why I read it as \"2\" and \"3\". The first thing I've seen was a flipped
    \"3\" -- simply because it has to little in common with a typical \"E\" -- which
    is the main reason why the shape of \"on\" isn't too important because it will
    always be perceived as \"2\" only because it makes sense, seeing a \"2\" on the
    left side of a \"3\". And since in the original post the logo is called \"one\"
    I think it's important to read \"one\" at first and then realize -- after you've
    analyzed the wordmark -- that the word is actually made up from \"2\" and \"3\".
    This kind of adds an element of surprise while otherwise it might appear a little
    \"conflicted\" and maybe slightly awkward.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I totally agree
    with riccard0's \"emotional impact\" of a top-heavy \"E\" and epsilicon's 90 degree
    turns, but I'm not sure if this two bonuses are more important then a good readability.
    In a perfect world you might be able to combine \"emotional impact\", 90 degree
    turns and readability. I wish you all the best for this and I think the cleverness
    of the idea should be motivation enough for you to design something better then
    our two versions."
