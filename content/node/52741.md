body: "G-Type have finally updated the best selling Houschka family and released the
  mighty Houschka Pro which, like its Rounded sister family, comes complete with CE
  & Cyrillic language support plus a host of alternates and typographic extras making
  it an extremely versatile family. Houschka Pro is a complete overhaul of the Houschka
  family, originally from 1999. 7 fonts in one single font x 6 weights! from Thin
  to Extra Bold.\r\n\r\nIn a quirk of fate, this week sees the opening of Jim Carrey\u2019s
  latest blockbuster, The Yes Man, featuring Houschka very prominently in the  <a
  href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2008/yes_man.html\">promo posters</a> and <a href=\"http://yesisthenewno.warnerbros.com\">website</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/houschkapdf_4872_4682.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  Houschka Pro 5-spread pdf (attached) is a guide to show how characters change with
  different features, sets etc.\r\n\r\nHouschka Pro is Postscript flavoured OpenType
  with the following features:\r\nRegular style set with 3 extra style sets\r\nLining
  numbers\r\nOld-style numbers (both are tabular and proportional)\r\nSmall Caps\r\nLigatures
  - ffi fi ffj ffl ff fj fl\r\nDiscretionary ligatures - ct fb fh fk ft sp st\r\nContextual
  alternates - A, W, w, also in small caps\r\nStylistic alternates - replacement infant
  a\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAll features work with each extra style set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    quality every text-going sans serif face really needs, contemporary distinctiveness.
    From one stylist to another --- congrats Nick.\r\n\r\nHouschka Pro is a top grade
    font production.\r\n\r\nHouschka Pro is currently charting well on the Myfonts
    Starlets chart.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "Fulsome praise indeed James! Thank you very much. I have checked out your
    work - some good stuff there. I read with interest your medical problems; that
    sounds really terrible. Strange to think that you were so incredibly unlucky and
    also extremely lucky (to survive) at the same time. I am glad you can still carry
    on doing the work that you love.\r\n\r\nI checked out MyFonts also. Houschka is
    #1 today on the 'Hot new fonts' section! (and quite a lot of my other stuff is
    also in there) Wow. But it is just the 'normal' Houschka that I did in 1999 -
    so, not that new really.  It was one of the first families I produced, so is  not
    a patch on the new improved 'Pro' family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Nick, I'm just glad I'm alive and try to make the most of every day and every
    situation no matter what the circumstances. That makes me more flexible when it
    comes to peeple, and more determined to get more of my fonts finished.\r\n\r\nCongrats
    on Houschka reaching #1 on (what used to be named) the Starlets chart. I knew
    it would, and I guess it will migrate to the best sellers chart soon. If you can
    just get the Pro version into that position.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
