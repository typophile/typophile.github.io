  modular display face consisting of letters, numerals, basic punctuation, and a few
  extra goodies. Featured on dafont, Free Typography, and Pixel Pixel Pixel.\r\n\r\nWhen
  using this typeface, bigger is better ;)\r\n\r\nAvailable on my personal website
  here: <a href=\"http://willryan.us/content/slinkster.html\" target=\"blank\">http://willryan.us</a>\r\n\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nI
  was recently contacted by someone asking if they can use a font I created for commercial
  use (the font is freely available for personal use). I'd like to get some money
  out of this if it's a possibility. How do I proceed from here?"

  body: "One foundry (at least) took the approach of asking commercial users of their
    fonts to make a voluntary (IIRC) Paypal donation to the order of what the users
    thought the fonts were worth.\r\n\r\nSome others require donations for commercial
    use, forgetting or ignoring that 'required donation' already has a name: 'Price'.\r\n\r\nThen
    there is barter, just to mention a third approach."

    designer and/or foundry, and keep the free variant as a teaser.

    my ignorance, but does it cost anything (on my end) to release a font through
    a foundry?"

  body: Will, check how much would vendors (Fontspring, MyFonts, Monotype?) charge
    you for selling your font. I believe the common range is between 30-50% of your
    sale price. Some foundries would offer you less but they would probably say they
    need to finish your font or market it exclusively, or some such. It's up to you,
    really.

  body: "In my experience, if you want to remain independent you would benefit from
    doing some research into equivelant commercial typefaces and what is being charged
    for them. It would also be worth considering an approach to embedding licensing
    and possible conversion for web font usage. PayPal is fairly standard in terms
    of payments and transactions.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I have it set up as donationware
    on dafont, but have yet to get any donations even after almost 25,000 downloads...</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>Donationware</strong>
    usually gets ignored, which is unfortunate, but it is often the case that the
    person downloading a font for a company that is happy to pay for it would not
    be the person responsible for making that payment.\r\n\r\nDafont offers the ability
    to post additional information about the font which you could use to make clear
    that commercial (print & digital) use requires a specified payment or is subject
    to a scale which you can discuss in greater detail via email and which would be
    payable via PayPal.\r\n\r\nIn my experience as someone that has negotiated this
    kind of payment the biggest obstacle when you want to license something appropriately
    is access to contact information, a clear overview of pricing and a convenient
    way to make payments."

  body: "Thanks for the info guys. I've always felt that Lost Type's setup is probably
    more financially rewarding than dafont's \"donate\" button. Dafont's setup consists
    of a download button with a donate button directly below, allowing the downloader
    to get the font immediately. Lost Type's system (at least last time I was on there)
    forced the downloader to \"name their price.\" Even though $0.00 is an acceptable
    value, being confronted with this screen might convince more people to donate.
    Maybe I'm over-thinking it...\r\n\r\nI've contacted MyFonts about getting it submitted
    onto their website and I'm currently talking back and forth with them. I've found
    out that they split the cost with their designers 50/50.\r\n\r\nAfter perusing
    their display face section, I'm thinking about selling it for $20-$30 (hopefully
    with a webfont version, too). I'm still really unsure if this is an appropriate
    price or not as I always seem to lowball myself when it comes to pricing... In
    the meantime I'm continuously tweaking the font and adding more and more glyphs
    :)"

    :-)</blockquote>\r\nSorry for the late reply... and, Yep, no problem.\r\nRegular
    users are still donation frequently (2 years after the release)... I haven't made
    exact calculations, but a very rough approximation will be something like $10
    per day... approx... (more or less: some days $1, some days $5, some days $10,
    some $25, some days $50, and some days none.). Sometimes, donations goes down
    a bit... them someone features the font in a blog, a donations goes up again...
    it's a bit random.\r\nOccasionally, Advertising Agencies donate a bit more ($100
    or $200... in exceptional cases up to $500). This only happens about once a month.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a screenshot of the last few days (donors names blurred):\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/2i1s0R221Y1X3Q1r252d/donations.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    $10/day) but it equals to a little under $2 per million servings. I have no idea
