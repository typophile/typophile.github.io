body: "Attached are three pdfs. Each is a sample cluster of words for three monoline
  variations on Gill Sans. These are inspired by Gill's serif faces but not meant
  to be sans versions of his serif faces. Instead, they're meant to be subtle variations
  on the classic Gill Sans \u2013 each with a bit different personality. One is a
  bit insular, staccato, plain. Two has more open counters and curves, and is hopefully
  more lyrical. Three is more robust, swaggering.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to weigh
  in with your opinions. Enjoy! And thank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gill-oneB_3775.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gill-twoB_5120.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gill-threeB_6210.gif]"

  body: Your font seems to be nice, I'm wondering how it will look like if you bold
    it, this method can help you to take decisions between your 3 propositions.

  body: "I love the 'f' in number one. All of these are very nice. Not sure if I like
    the 'a' in number two, but it could just be that it's the furthest from Gill Sans.
    Overall, number one is my favourite, followed by three then two.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Lex, Kuroneko \u2013 thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe 'a' in number two
    was inspired by the 'a' in Gill's Perpetua. It has a lot of curl to it.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    yes, I'm working on bolds. I have sets drawn, but I'm not completely happy with
    them yet."
