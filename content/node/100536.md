      And I feel confident no outlines have been reused in the grunge fonts I have
      reworked. I base this on the horrible quality of the outlines, spacing and character
      sets of the fonts I started out with... ;) They were probably created with printouts
      or samples printed out, then grunged up, scanned and outlined. Which I think
      is a fair working method.\r\n\r\nAnd f.ex. Nick Curtis and Halmos Levente are
      excellent at drawing outlines with beziers, so all their fonts are drawn from
      scratch, for sure.\r\n\r\nMyself, I also drew my own (rather geometric) version
      of DIN Mittelschrift (from the german specs) before creating all my experimental
      variants of it in my (still ongoing) DINfun project.\r\n\r\nI have made every
      effort to keep CheapProFonts an honest and fair foundry (even fighting some
      REAL pirates in the background) and have a very clear conscience about my work."

    referring to. \r\n\r\nThe issue for me is when you can plainly identify that a
    commercial font was used as the basis for a grunge/distressed font. When the base
    lettershapes are created by redrawing  \u2014 no matter how badly :-) \u2014 it
    is obviously less egregious than actual outline theft, but that does not make
    it any more ethical in my book (no matter that it is legal in some markets). AFAIC
    it directly sponges off the designer of the original font because, let\u2019s
    be frank here, the finished product wouldn\u2019t exist without that original.\r\n\r\nFurthermore
    when a font such as this is done by an amateur enthusiast and intended to be released
    for free that\u2019s one thing, but when subsequently given a commercial release
    that\u2019s something else entirely. "
