  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I would like to share with all of you, the [[spacing]] method I used on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calouste<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(PDF file)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the typeface I designed at Reading.</p>
<p>After trying out a few spacing methods with no success, I felt the need to devise my own system, which has proven to generate fairly good results (not just for me but also for other people that have used it). The method is definitely not an outstanding innovation, nevertheless I haven&rsquo;t come across anything exactly like it elsewhere. Basically I took advantage of [[adhesiontext]], the text tool I had developed earlier.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t guarantee this method will work on every typeface. However I&rsquo;m able to say that it made miracles on mine, as some could attest. Perhaps with a few adaptations it can still be useful and applicable in other cases.</p>
<p>I would also want to warn that, as it will be obvious, this is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->REALLY<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tedious process. Nonetheless, the outcome will most likely be quite rewarding, and time-saving.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to add that this procedure might also help to drastically reduce the number of kerning pairs needed (at least that&rsquo;s what happened to me&hellip;).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Method Used<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I divided the lowercase alphabet in 3 groups, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bdhilmnopqu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->acefjkrt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gsvwxyz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the assumption that:</p>
<p>a) the space on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both sides<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of each element of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be determined, and relates to the space attributed to, at least, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of another element in the same group, which has a similar shape. (e.g. the space on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->right side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->b<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->p<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the same as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->o<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Or, the space on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->left side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->h<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the same given to the same side of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->l<!-- raw HTML omitted -->);</p>
<p>b) the space on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of each element of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2nd group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is determined, and is equal to the spaces given to the elements of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with a similar shape (i.e. the space on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->left side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->k<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the same given to the same side of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->h<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, despite the fact that the space on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->right side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->k<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) has no relation with any character in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->);</p>
<p>c) the space around the elements of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3rd group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has no direct relation with any of the other characters in the alphabet. (this is very design-dependent, as for example if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->g<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is not binocular-style, it should be included in the previous groups).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I spaced <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->o<!-- raw HTML omitted --> visually, balancing the white area between and inside the characters (the string <!-- raw HTML omitted -->noonnon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is good for that). Then replicated those amounts (with the necessary adjustments) to the rest of the elements on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, always keeping in mind to assign the same value to similar/equal shapes. (e.g. the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->left side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->m<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might receive the same amount of the same side of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But (for a serifed typeface) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->p<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might need less space on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->left side<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, because it might not have a serif on the baseline)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I printed a few test documents only with words that could be set using characters from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and made the necessary corrections/adjustments.
Note: Here I would like to say that, in this first trial, it was clear that some of the glyphs had to be slightly changed (specially the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->o<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), because they were &ldquo;breaking the rhythm/pattern&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> After a <em>few</em> other print-outs and tons of adjustments, the elements of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were finally acceptably spaced, so it was time to do the next step.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The next step consisted on adding, sequentially, each element of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2nd group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and space it against the elements of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This meant generating test documents with the set of characters <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bdhilmnopqua<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and space the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bdhilmnopquc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and space the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and so on.
Note: It&rsquo;s very likely that the elements of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will still need some fine adjustments along the way, which could also be used on characters with related shapes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The following step was simply doing the process described above, but this time with each element of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3rd group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Finally, I set a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; text and the overall spacing was just about right. Some fine-tuning, and from this point on was &ldquo;kerning time&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing that with l/c HOHHOOH for 30 years. Print out large proofs, hang them on the wall, walk away until the letters look like 12 pt, have someone adjust the distance between them with you shouting instructions from a few meters (or feet) away, and finally take a pencil and divide the space between the letters on the wall. That gives you the initial sidebearings for straight and round sides. That was the method at Do-I-Get-Sued-For-Mentioning-Berthold way back in the 70s. A picture with me in front of H and O is around, but not published anywhere except on an old FontShop xmas card which made use of the 
HOHOHO. If only posting images were easy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miguel, although the basic spacing procedure you describe is quite sound, I do note some problems in your PDF, but these are typically kerning issues. For instance there is too much space between the roman <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wa<!-- raw HTML omitted --> combination.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with your approach is that it seems to presume that the glyphs themselves have already been design and grouped prior to spacing. I space as I go along, and consider spacing to be intrinsic to glyph design. I don&rsquo;t think you can correctly judge the relative widths of letters without previewing them in words or pseudo-words, and this means that spacing has to be done <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as part of glyph design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and not as a secondary stage after the outlines are complete. Calouste has many very nice features &ndash; kudos on the Armenian &ndash;, but the r is a bit too wide and the s is a bit too narrow, and I wonder if this would have been so if you had addressed the spacing concurrently with the design of these letters.</p>

<p>Well, can&rsquo;t really say. Maybe the ragged-right columns, but the paragraphs on pp. 10-11 are not that bad. Nevertheless you&rsquo;ll definitely have to print it out to see it properly. On screen things don&rsquo;t look as good.</p>

<p>Nice. This year&rsquo;s students should try that. It surely will make spacing more interactive and less boring. Besides, there will be more than a pair of eyes judging, which might be a good thing (or maybe not&hellip;).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Latin is superb and the Armenian is inspired*, in fact better than some of the best native designers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Uau, thanks! As I didn&rsquo;t know the script, or the language (which unfortunately I still don&rsquo;t), I had to do a substantial amount of research, to inform my design decisions. Then it was submitted to people that can actually read it, and the necessary changes were made.
There are still a few things that I will like to change, but the essencial is there.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->John:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->For instance there is too much space between the roman wa combination.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll have to check that. (Although it&rsquo;s not as noticeable as when printed)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->and this means that spacing has to be done as part of glyph design and not as a secondary stage after the outlines are complete.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I completely agree with you, and as I say in the note to point 3, the glyph outlines are likely to have to be changed. Otherwise certain letter combinations will never work, despite of how well the typeface is spaced.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I space as I go along, and consider spacing to be intrinsic to glyph design.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Absolutely, can&rsquo;t agree more. However, one can do that once he/she is experienced, like you. The experience that enables one to pinpoint that the problem is on the glyph&rsquo;s design, and not on the space around it (or vice versa).
Since this was the first typeface I designed, I felt the need to fix one of the variables (the design) and tackle the other (the spacing) separately. Then whenever I felt that changing the spacing was no longer useful, I would turn to the design and make the necessary adjustments. Then go back to spacing, and so on.
Of course, it goes without saying that Gerry (Leonidas) played an important role here, telling me when I should put the design in stand-by, and start caring about spacing. That was when I approach the problem and developed the method.
But as you might understand, when learning typeface design, it&rsquo;s difficult to handle these two issues (glyph design and spacing) at the same. Despite of the fact that they&rsquo;re interdependent, one has to come aware of that gradually, otherwise things will end up all over the place. At least that&rsquo;s how I felt.
All in all, I simply wanted to share the method that worked for me. I thought that it would eventually be helpful to others, and, at the same time, use all your comments to improve it.</p>

<p>Thank you. You might be right about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->r<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but this might also be one of those situations where the designer&rsquo;s experience, sensibility and/or views (about how the structure of a certain letter must be) enter a subjective and more personal area. For example, for some reason I can&rsquo;t really explain, I&rsquo;m very sensitive to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sa<!-- raw HTML omitted --> combination, and will almost like/dislike a particular typeface just based on that.

Sorry I missed your PDF link in the first line before (I just saw your Zip file).
Now I see what all the fuss is about! I don&rsquo;t mean the spacing, that has already been discussed.  I mean the passion in the forms of the letters!  Quite beautiful&ndash;I hope to see many books set in your Calouste in the future.
Also, the way you presented your work is a very good tool for those interested in learning the nuances of type design.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll sometimes add kerning to preview strings in FontLab while I&rsquo;m working on glyph and spacing design, but I&rsquo;ll always remove all such temporary kerning afterwards, and tackle kerning from scratch in a systematic way once I am happy with the glyph forms and spacing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miguel, the thing with me is that I -generally- oppose the conventional wisdom of making the base spacing work &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo; without kerning, and only using kerning to polish things up. The main reason for this is that I feel that users who don&rsquo;t have kerning enabled aren&rsquo;t picky anyway; so if you can assume that kerning is available, you can streamline things a fair amount. Another reason is actually related to Armenian type design, where relying heavily on kerning, especially positive kerning, can save you a ton of effort - noting here that (to me) in Design, economy of effort is central - and the time I save NOT making &ldquo;fool-proof&rdquo; kernless spacing is time I can use for things that are needed more.</p>
<p>Anyway, in reference to what I wrote before what it boils down to is that when my black bodies start getting affected because of spacing considerations, sometimes this is &ldquo;damped&rdquo; by the eventual presence of kerning too, depending on the character and its probable adjacencies*. But it&rsquo;s not numeric, it&rsquo;s more&hellip; fudgy, although it&rsquo;s also iterative (of course) so subject to tweaking.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miquel, my approach to kerning is to use a list of real words that show combinations in context, so I start with a word that include an &lsquo;aa&rsquo; combination, and then one with an &lsquo;ab&rsquo; combination, and so on. I have good lists for Latin and Greek, and a slightly less good one for Cyrillic (it is Russian-centric, and isn&rsquo;t reliable for other languages). Once I&rsquo;ve done this, I extend to diacritic letters either using classes or simply by copying kerning, depending on the size of the project. After that, I do diacritic exceptions e.g. &lsquo;Tä&rsquo; as distinct from &lsquo;Ta&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m working on a script for which word lists are difficult to obtain, e.g. Ethiopic, I use class-based kerning and make it as thorough as possible, even if this means including kern data for combinations that may never occur in natural language. I&rsquo;d rather try to ensure that any combination will look good, rather than trying to guess what might be common or not. Nyala, which will ship with Windows Vista contains the class-based equivalent of more than 65,000 kern pairs. I usually enjoy kerning, but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy that! If I don&rsquo;t have an actual word list, I create FontLab preview lists that show pairs in context of regularly spacing glyphs.</p>
<p>Because almost all of my projects involve OTL tables developed in VOLT, I use Sergey Malkin&rsquo;s excellent &lsquo;kern2volt&rsquo; conversion tool, which examines expanded kern table data and builds efficient classes based on kerning values. So my workflow is FontLab class kerning -&gt; expanded (flat) kern table values* -&gt; VOLT via kern2volt.</p>
<ul>
<li>FontLab Studio 5 includes special handling for very large kern table export as a result of one of my extended Arabic projects that had more than 72,000 expanded kern pairs.</li>

<p>Given my market, I have to assume that large numbers of users are working with MS Word. Kerning is off by default (although not for complex scripts, thankfully), and most users don&rsquo;t know how to turn it on. I think such users may well be &lsquo;picky&rsquo;, but if they see a font that has bad spacing because kerning isn&rsquo;t on, they&rsquo;re not going to spend time finding out why this problem exists and how to turn on kerning: they&rsquo;re just going to blame the font and use a different one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with John. Although MS Word users don&rsquo;t get everything out of their fonts (because kerning is not on by default), they will still get the most out of it, given that the font is well spaced. Glyph sidebearing values have to exist in the font, either we want it or not. Kerning information doesn&rsquo;t. So, relying on kerning and adding superfluous pairs to the font (and I&rsquo;m not refering to the extra kerning data that John included for the Ethiopic font, for example), simply makes its size bigger, and adds more data that the applications have to deal with (which means it&rsquo;s more prone to errors and will use more resources).
My view is, if you can do it with spacing, don&rsquo;t do it with kerning.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m working on an expressive brush drawn typeface, and I need a extensive list of words that contain ALL possible letter pairs in the basic Latin character set (ideally 3 examples of each combination, so as to give a good representation). Does anyone know of how to do this, or have such a list?</p>
<p>The methods mentioned above are useful, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem they&rsquo;ll quite do this.</p>
<p>It appears to me that AdhesionText is useful, and but does not cover ALL possible combinations. While I could create overall good kerning with this tool, I might end up missing many combinations.</p>
<p>The method of listing like this &ldquo;abacadaeafag&hellip;&rdquo; etc. is also helpful, but realistically it&rsquo;s very difficult to eye how kerning will really look once tranlated into actual words&hellip;.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Rob Arnow</p>

		<div class="commentbody">OK. Do you use unsymmetrical spacing for caps sometimes? I mean, having the minuscule and majuscules &ldquo;well spaced&rdquo; - &ldquo;HnHing&rdquo; can reveal a gap between H and n. One could leave it (and kern later), but how about trying to manage it by changing the symmetry axis in caps?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Saleem, a font that works in Word on Windows should work in InDesign ME version on both platforms. I am surprised by what you are showing, because I wouldn&rsquo;t expect this kind of problem, and have not seen this with any other fonts.</p>
<p>I note also the very tight spacing between the ر and ک near the end of the first line in the InDesign example. Is that intentional?</p>
<p>[Marcin, Chris, this isn&rsquo;t a ligature on/off issue. The correct Arabic &lsquo;init&rsquo; and &lsquo;medi
shaping is not occurring for some letters in some situations.]</p>

<p>Say: Even Adobe Arabic does not work on InDesign correctly?!
To position themselves in the Arabic World,
Adobe + WinSoft must digest what is explained here:
