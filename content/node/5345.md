body: As you may know, Quark has made the decision not to support OpenType and Unicode
  in their Mac OS/X product.  Most font problems in QuarkXPress 6 relate to the use
  of language fonts like CE, Greek, Cyrillic, or any Type1 font that has a non MacRoman
  encoding. <BR>  <BR>Type1 fonts in Mac OS/X rely on the new Apple Quartz system
  to define a codepage for the correct encoding. This however is not performing as
  expected, and is unlikely to be addressed by Apple as the Type1 font format is seen
  by Adobe and Apple as redundant. <BR>  <BR>The DTP Types hfont Format <BR>  <BR>At
  DTP Types Limited, we have developed a hybrid font format that performs like a Type1
  font in QuarkXPress for Mac OS/X for any encoding. We call this new format &#39;hfont&#39;
  format. hfonts also work well in all other Mac OS/X applications that we have tested
  &#40;Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Microsoft Word, Nisus Writer, Apple
  Text Edit&#41;. They perform like any other font in the system and can be installed
  via &#39;Fonts&#39; folders or by any font manager software &#40;e.g. Suitcase&#41;.
  The new format does not solve the problem of passing non-Unicode text to Unicode
  applications or Unicode text to non-Unicode applications. The new hfonts will not
  work in Mac OS/9. <BR>  <BR>DTP Types hfont Availability <BR>  <BR>All DTP Types
  fonts are available in hfont format at the same cost as Type1 fonts. We can also
  create hfont format fonts from any other font manufacturer, providing their license
  agreement allows this, or there is permission from the manufacturer for us to create
  the fonts for you. The creation of fonts from other foundries is a chargeable service,
  the price is available on application. <BR>  <BR>A trial hfont format font is available
  from our web site. <a href="http://www.dtptypes.com" target="_blank">http://www.dtptypes.com</a>

  body: Although QXP 6 does not do these things, reportedly QXP 7 will. Only time
    will tell, of course. <BR> <BR>T
