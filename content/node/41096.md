  a sansserif typeface that..\r\n\r\na) features an international character set (specifically
  latin, greek and cyrillic)\r\n\r\nb) provides itself in various weights (light,
  regular, medium, bold + italics)\r\n\r\nc) has a modern/grotesque appeal to it but
  is slightly newer/fresher/more contemporary (sorry, i know it depends on ones perspective)
  then 'classics' like helvetica, trade, et cetera..\r\n\r\ncurrently i am looking
  at typefaces like 'akkurat' by lineto or 'national' by klimtype which i personally
  really like -\r\n\r\nthe typeface is supposed to be used as a corporate typeface
  that will be used within a complete corporate design system.\r\n\r\nany recommandations/suggestions
  are highly welcome/appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks a lot + kind regards,\r\n\r\nsteffen"

  body: "thanks a lot so far -\r\n\r\nDaxline + Din are great, though din is not applicable
    in this case and daxline feels a bit overused.. Kievit i have to look into..\r\n\r\nas
    well as Anselm + Bliss Pro are interesting -\r\n\r\nthe fontfeed link is absolutely
    great though, so thanks stephen!\r\n\r\nThe possibility of National in greek +
    cyrillic would be extraordinary, but it would probably take up too much time to
    be designed.. But maybe, who knows.. \r\n\r\nI will have a look at the fonts at
    ourtype (just came to mind) + get back..\r\n\r\nI still like National the most
    though..\r\n\r\nBest + thanks to you both,\r\n\r\nso far,\r\n\r\nsteffen\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks again for the replys..\r\n\r\nnot that easy to find many fonts that
    match the criteria and are a) a charm for the eyes and b) not yet overused -\r\n\r\nparachute
    has some..\r\n\r\nPrivia Pro from DS Type looks interesting, though not modernist/geometric
    enough for the client we are working on.. I think they tend to buy Akkurat from
    Lineto. I will send a mail to Kris (?) from Klimtype anyway since i am personally
    very interested in National which i really like -\r\n\r\nWhat is it about the
    greek and cyrillic in Privia that appears problematic to you, paul - or mr. 'bezier
    wrangler' as i'd might dare to to call :) ?\r\n\r\nbest, thanks + kindest regards,

    they say, the devil's in the details, and IMO Priva misses quite a few. but to
    be completely candid, i've had mixed reviews on my own cyrillics."
