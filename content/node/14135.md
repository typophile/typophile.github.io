    it looks like FI, but you probably ought to move the I a little closer to the
    F to make the interletter spacing consistent."

  body: I think the lettering is to tight overall. That spacing looks 1970s, let it
    breathe.

  body: "kerning is unbalanced, especially since you are using a ligature, which pretty
    much sets the spacing for the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nIcon needs to be bigger.
    I can't tell what it is."
