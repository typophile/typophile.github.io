body: "Hi Typos,\r\n\r\nRecently a client contacted me about the terms of our (more
  than) year old corporate identity contract. The project consisted of the standard
  corporate identity materials: letterhead, faxhead, business card, two types of envelopes.
  The logo had been previously developed (by us), but the CID project consisted of
  doing some finishing work on it. Do to budgetary constraints, the client opted out
  of a graphic identity standards manual against my recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe client
  called me with concerns about the 'Rights & Ownership' clauses. I used the standard
  AIGA contract for this job. The section states:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. RIGHTS AND
  OWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n### 5.1. Rights\r\n\r\nAll services provided by the Designer under
  this Agreement shall be for the\r\nexclusive use of the Client other than for the
  promotional use of the Designer.\r\nUpon payment of all fees and expenses, the following
  reproduction rights for all\r\napproved final designs created by the Designer for
  this project shall be\r\ngranted:\r\n\r\n> Unlimited reproduction/usage of Corporate
  Identity designs\r\n\r\n### 5.2. Ownership\r\n\r\nAll drawings, artwork, specifications,
  and other visual presentation materials\r\nremain the property of the Designer.
  The Client shall be entitled to temporary\r\npossession of such materials only for
  the purpose of reproduction after which\r\nall materials shall be returned, unaltered,
  to the Designer.\r\n\r\nAll preliminary concepts and visual presentations produced
  by the Designer\r\nremain the property of the Designer and may not be used by the
  Client without\r\nthe written permission of the Designer.\r\n\r\nThe Designer shall
  retain all artwork, drawings, and specifications, for which\r\nreproduction rights
  have been granted for a specified period from the date of\r\nthe signing of this
  Agreement. Upon expiration of this period, all such\r\nmaterials may be destroyed
  unless the Client has requested, in writing, that\r\nthey be retained and agrees
  to pay reasonable storage charges. The Client shall\r\nhave reasonable access to
  all such materials for the purpose of review.\r\n\r\nThe specified time for the
  Designer to retain such materials shall be\r\n\r\n> 365 days/One year\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe
  client wants me to amend the contract to turn over ownership to him. This (BTW)
  is more than one year later. It appears that he never read the contract in the first
  place. He said things like \"I don't feel comforatble with this\" and \"what if
  you die tomorrow?\" and \"what if you try to screw me?\" -- sighting a past negative
  experience with a photographer. His rational that he paid for it so he should own
  it seems typical. What, in fact, he paid for was my creative problem solving/services
  to arrive at a corporate identity.\r\n\r\nIt is my feeling (from his other questions/rhetoric)
  that this really has more to do with the logo than anything else. I think they think
  that they should just be able to take their logo and \"slap it on\" anything they
  like without my involvement. In fact, they already broke a previous (website) contract
  by attemting to have the logo and other design elements reproduced onto t-shirts.
  Naturally, they came out looking AWFUL. This makes both of us look bad -- their
  corporate image and my reputation. To be fair, however, I don't think they were
  aware that they had breached our contract.\r\n\r\nI never said anything about this,
  except that the t-shirts didn't look very good and that they'd be lucky to get rid
  of them. Had they approached me, I would have been glad to design the t-shirts for
  a modest fee.\r\n\r\nNow that we're onto designing their vehicles, this whole thing
  has reared it's head. I almost feel like I had to force the issue of being involved
  with creating an appropriate design and use of the logo for the vehicles when they
  implied they just wanted a digital version to give to thier 'vehicle guy' to \"slap
  it on.\" \r\n\r\nThey don;t have anyone in-house to manage design and the vartious
  parties who \"slap it on\" are neither qualified. That's where I come in -- or so
  I thought.\r\n\r\nThis client has profited TREMENDOUSLY from my services over the
  past two years, and now I get the impression that they feel extorted and would like
  to get full rights and push me out the door. I don't know this for sure, but it's
  the feeling I get.\r\n\r\nMy position is that I generally enjoy working with them
  and would like to continue to help them develop their visual identity in a logical
  and consistant manner.\r\n\r\nMY QUESTION(S) are really as regards to the legal
  issues here and how to respond/discuss this with the client. I've never come up
  against legal/contract question, although I hear it's not uncommon. I'm inclined
  to not make concessions without renegotiation and financial compensation, and (at
  least) developing a standards manual). I think they may not respond well to this.
  Your feedback and advice is much needed. In addittion, any references to other sources
  of legal advice as related to design services/rights & ownership/copyrights, etc.
  is most welcome.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n -t\r\n\r\n"

    contract. \"I didn't read the contract\" or \"I don't like its terms anymore\"
    don't cut the mustard legally.\r\n\r\nAny lawyer this client consults would tell
    them the same thing.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

    they already \"have reasonable access to\") to re-insert yourself into their day-to-day
    use of the logo.\r\n\r\nSi\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As Si says they have unrestricted usage of the logo and your artwork for
    their stationery* as long as they have paid the fees. \r\n\r\n*although you can
    request some kind of additional storage fee.\r\n\r\nCertainly you could/should
    charge for providing any other services, however, playing Devil's advocate, the
    client has paid you for the work involved in the creation of the logo and they
    have a point in their assertion that they have paid for the logo and can use it
    however they choose, no matter what you advise them. \r\n\r\nTo keep your relationship
    with the client, I think you should accede to their request with good grace, letting
    them know that you are not compelled to do this. Suggest that you act as a consultant/brand
    guardian (checking and approving) and, if you can quantify it, show how they have
    profited from your work. Insisting that they use your services in creating a standards
    manual will feel to the client as more extortion.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I think there may be some confusion on both out parts as to the meaning of
    the clauses. The way I understand it, the final approved designs (logo, CID materials)
    are for exlusive and unlimited usage/reproduction of the client. I.E., they're
    the only ones allowed to use them, except me (for promotional purposes).\r\n\r\nThe
    ownership clause is referring to \"drawings, artwork, specifications, and other
    visual presentation materials\" -- not the final approved designs/services, yes?
    Doesn't this just mean that all the materails that I produced to arrive at the
    final design are my property, but that I hold them for a year?\r\n\r\nAny lawyers
    in the house?\r\n\r\n -t"

  body: You could be right - but I can't think the AIGA would have a model contract
    that defines 'exclusive use' as giving the client no rights to share a design
    with a printer or t-shirt maker. Do they provide an FAQ for the cotnract or a
    'human readable' form?
