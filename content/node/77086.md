body: I need to identify the typeface used in this logo. Looks like a fairly classical
  serif. I thought it was ITC Legacy and have checked too numerous others to mention.
  But to no avail. WhatTheFont, Identifont, Fontshop and Font Haus were all unable
  to identify it. There have been close ones, but none that match. Thanks in advance
  if you solve this.

  body: Okay, I thought I'd also mention some of the other faces I've checked. FF
    Clifford, FF Reminga, Griffo, Bembo, Galliard, all the Caslons (I think) New Times
    Roman, Times Roman, Minion, Baskerville, Goudy (all of them), Palatino, Perpetua,
    The Garamonds, and there were still others. Hope someone can I.D. this face. Thanks

  body: Well done! I believe that's it. I just have to view it a bit larger, but it
    explains why no one else found it. They're not authorized resellers for that face.
    Thanks again Atwe. Brilliant.
