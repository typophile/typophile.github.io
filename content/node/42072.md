body: "When saving a slightly edited font in Font Forge I ran the validation check
  and got a string of errors (not caused by me \u2014 they were in glyphs I hadn't
  touched). Almost all of them were of the kind \"extremal points missing\". Are these
  errors that I should endeavor to correct? Are they serious in any way?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nEl."

  body: "Yes, you should always draw your outlines with points on the extrema. It
    is good habit, and it makes curves much easier to tweak and edit later one (by
    you or by someone else\u2026 if you are using FontForge, you'd probably be OK
    with other people editing your fonts later on down the line\u2026)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it can play a role in hinting and on-screen rendering. No points at extrema =
    bad\u2026 unless you have a convincing design reason not to put them in a few
    particular spots\u2026 there are always exceptions to rules. But in general, it
    is good to do."

  body: Certain very small curve segments, e.g. at the tips of serifs, are sometimes
    left without extrema points, but otherwise you should always use them. As Dan
    notes, they are important for hinting, and also for calculating glyph bounding
    boxes accurately.

    a curve and the points are not all in extrema, will tossing in an extra extrema
    point improve screen rendering?'

  body: "I should just clarify \u2014 even if it makes no difference to the good sense
    of the answers here \u2014 that the font that failed the validation test was a
    font that was purchased from Linotype. It's not one of my making, but I wondered
    if I should try to fix it if it's seriously broken."

  body: "Points at extrema are useful in general, for the reasons Dan gave. There
    are some situations where they aren't always so useful, particularly in scripts
    and italics, e.g.:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/37374\">http://www.typophile.com/node/37374</a>\r\n<a

  body: "James: assuming decent auto-hinting, and a renderer that is using hinting
    of some sort, yes. Of course, once you've added points at extrema, you may be
    able to delete some other points.\r\n\r\nBut as noted, some extrema are more important
    than others.\r\n\r\nT"
