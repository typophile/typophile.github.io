  body: Looks like a logo to me, meaning not-a-font. Depending on what you need exactly,
    the quickest way would probably be to trace it using any good vectorization software/function
    (i.e. tracing function under Illustrator). You could even start with any generic
    sans fitting your needs. As usual, Helvetica Neue (probably Bold or bolder) could
    perfectly do the job. You'd just need to round /A top left corner and recreate
    /T manually slanting either regular or italic /T (or may be using /W last oblique
    right stroke with an additional horizontal stroke) then rounding top left corner.
