  \"Sum of the Parts\" typeface? This is a face that has only eleven characters, each
  of which serve as two to three letters, (apparently) distinguishable by context.
  I read about it in his article anthologized in Heller and Meggs's _Texts on Type_,
  but an illustration for it is not provided. I'm curious as to what it looks like.
  \r\nThanks in advance,\r\nCraig."

    of an image. I just kind of assumed it was like my mother's handwriting. You should
    try to email Tobias directly to see if he has a picture of it. \r\n\r\nAlso, <a

    a couple things in their free section along similar conceptual lines. "
