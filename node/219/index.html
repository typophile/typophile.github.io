		<div class="commentbody">I agree Hrant. If Anonymous could name names then we'd have something to chew on. A few years ago, when I was more passionate about my own designs, I thought it would be a great endeavor - to craft fonts for a living. Nowadays, I get font design ideas several times a week, like I imagine many readers of this forum do. Some of them I sketch out on paper, and some I file in the back of my head: a mix of Bodoni and Eurostyle - yes! That's it - the next great font phenomenon! But none of these will ever get past the sketch stage. It's simply not worth the effort - commercially.  <BR>If there are T-26, or P22, or Chank, or Font Bureau submitees or whoever you care to shake a stick at reading this forum who do indeed make more than pocket money from their designs then please step forward and tell us how it's done. We're dieing to know and we have no intention of ripping you off by copying you! And if there are any major font publishers out there, then please make the case for us as to how it is worth spending Xhundred hours developing a font/font family for $1 or less per hour.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen: I agree with you. Anonymous makes some interesting points, and it is nice to see  criticism with some teeth for a change. It does tend to be a little soft in some of the critique forums, although people here seem to be very astute on purely typographical matters, and the level of expertise in many discussions is very high indeed. Personally I refrain from posting negative comments on designs I don't like. I'd rather just keep out of it, and I don't want to pretend my taste in design is better than anyone else's - so I guess I've been adding to the softness of the critique here.

If they're doing &quot;other things&quot; it's because they're between projects or they want to do other things.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guys, focus. <BR>What's the point of this thread? Of course it's different for each of us, but practically speaking to me it's a way to measure (albeit informally) the viability of physically spending time doing type design (which does not include lettering, logo design, oriental calligraphy, etc.) This necessarily means we can't factor in what &quot;making a living&quot; really means; each of us would have to skew the &quot;results&quot; of this list based on his/her own lifestyle/circumstances. Once we have a good (never perfect) list, each of us can look at it and say, for example: &quot;From what I know, about half of those 20 people seem to live too modestly for my tastes, so for me the list is actually around 10&quot;. No absolute list is going to work for everybody: so it has to be inclusive, but not imprecise. <BR> <BR>The only way I see that this thread can have any real value is if the list is defined somewhat narrowly, by simplifying the parameters: so I think the list should contain the names of individuals who currently earn enough money directly from their own personal time spent designing type to substancially sustain a lifestyle they consider satisfying. It doesn't have to be 100% of their income, but it does have to be enough on its own to maintain the person in a relatively happy state. Yes, this is all subjective, but that can't be avoided, and picture this thread if we tried to factor in more parameters&hellip; <BR> <BR>If there is a better way to make this thread *productive*, please explain. If not, that list of 52 for example holds no water at all, I'm sorry to say. There are people on it who no longer design type, a person I know for a fact has had to start working as a waiter because he couldn't make a living in type design, a person who has released for sale a single -and unpopular- font in his entire &quot;career&quot;, and a bunch of others who aren't even close to making any such list. <BR> <BR>Let's agree what the list *is* before we argue for the sake of confrontation&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey look, I'm in the top 50! <BR> <BR>I'd disagree with a few of those names earning most of their income from type, definitely me anyway, at the moment. <BR> <BR>What some of you seem to be concentrating on is retail sales of fonts. I don't think that's a really major feature of many people's incomes. I've never put out a retail font, but I've certainly paid more than a few bills through my type work. I've never flown on Concorde, but I've been to the US and Canada 6 or 7 times in the past five years, all over Europe and even as far as New Zealand. <BR> <BR>I'd say that the type business supports around 3-400 people world wide on a full time basis, excluding those working in retail sales which probably comes to around another couple of hundred. <BR> <BR>The 3-400 is probably comprised of 600 or so actual bodies who drift in and out over time or as they are completing other projects. Most of those I know and have contact with directly, on a regular basis would agree that sitting down and drawing type 100% of the time would drive us nuts. <BR> <BR>So we all do things &quot;on the side&quot;. <BR> <BR>You can believe what you like, but I'm certain that those throwing around figures like &quot;10&quot; are very wrong. <BR> <BR>I'd also say that for those trying to separate type design, lettering and even straight up typography, that's a losing game. Anyone with an &quot;eye&quot; for it is going to be moving between the three all the time.</div>

Doing things on the side is fine if you enjoy it (and I do). But if I do things on the side because doing more of what I really want to do (type design) doesn't pay *enough* of the bills (not just a few), then I'm not on the list. <BR> <BR>As for the difference between type and not: <BR>It's not just an &quot;eye&quot; for it. Type design involves things that lettering or any other letter-related art/craft does not (and the other way around too).

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, at the moment, I'm pretty much an accountant that does a bit of type on the side. :-) <BR> <BR>I think to be on &quot;the list&quot; you have to be able to make the &quot;choice&quot; about what you want to work on. My current choice is not to be doing much type, however I know that if I want to I have plenty of opportunity to be doing it, I probably will be doing a &quot;bit on the side&quot; over the next six months. Not sure I deserve to be on the list anyway. :-) <BR> <BR>But I do think there are a lot more people involved than has been stated here. <BR> <BR>As to what is/is not worthy of the list. I'll basically stick with what I wrote previously: type design, lettering and straight-up typography are all of a mix to me. I will qualify that in stating that I'm really looking to the higher end there. <BR> <BR>I'll discard my own input for a moment, because i think otherwise it'll look really subjective. However, all of the people I know pretty well, working at the higher end, are all first rate typographers as well as being type designers and or letterers. People have mentioned Roger Black and Erik Spiekermann, despite initial reactions I'd say that both of them are really better known for their typography. That flows throughout the higher end, people have the &quot;eye&quot;. <BR> <BR>Even if you look at Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum, two people definitely known for their type design, they've always done some really neat typography to go with it - and the way they do that is sometimes shocking, but they really can pull it off. <BR> <BR>You know, type was a sideline for Eric Gill, but didn't he make something of it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We might as well just pack up and go 'ome&hellip;  <BR> <BR>Font design always was a labor of love, and personally that's all it will remain for me. I think it's safe to say that a graphic designer who doesn't enjoy type could not be forced at gunpoint to design a four font family with complete character sets. There again, I've never met a graphic designer, even a bad one, who didn't like fonts.  <BR> <BR>Anon's list is not valid in my opinion if they can't back up the names with other points of reference to assess their validity, notwithstanding the supposed subjectivity of the &quot;making a living&quot; parameter. I always understood the definition to be someone whose main income was from font design. We already went over this, though. Side work does not invalidate a candidate, but it does factor into the hypothetical question of if you took that away from them, would they soon become bankrupt on font design income alone.</div>

If there's a strong correlation between being a type designer and having no dependents, maybe that's another indication that there's not enough money in the field. <BR> <BR>AS A FATHER OF TWO, I would assume that question 1 is asked by someone who does not have kids. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>If you are a type designer or any occupation, and have nothing else going on in your life, you will of course be more prolific in your chosen endeavor because you will have hundreds (thousands?) more hours of free time in year. Is that better? Any parent would say No. Someone obsessed with a career may put off a family or love interest because they have goals to fulfill, or even type libraries to build. These are choices that individuals make every day. But the two don't have to be mutually exclusive. You just have to strike a balance. You are not working on your typefaces when you are teaching your kids about volcanos or answering questions like, 'Why can't humans live on Jupiter?'  When you have kids, the best time to work on type is after the kids go to bed. <BR> <BR>2. Just an outsider's evaluation: There is money in the field, but only for those who can consistently apply themselves to the craft and learn HOW to make money. Everybody knows it's long hours hunched over a computer moving around anchor points. The people who have a career in type (some of them on the Typophile 50) <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> have learned that you can't just make brilliant faces, but you have to network, market, have some good timing and act smart when big companies come calling. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>p.s. does anyone care for the word 'hobby'?

I shouldn't have clicked on anonymous but I did. Sorry. This isn't how I live my life so it has been bothering me.

		<div class="commentbody">Random thoughts to help push this thread into 2002. <BR> <BR>(Theater of the Absurd 1) <BR> <BR>During the past 15 years, TENS of THOUSANDS of typefaces have been digitized, a lot of them by foundries working from their existing 'paper' libraries. Somebody did (is doing) all that work. They are making a living at it. So should we at least acknowledge major foundry 'house' designers that 'fontify' in the shadows with no credit ever given to their 'work'. I'm not talking about Adobe. I'm talking about Image Club, E &amp; F, DsnHaus and that ilk. <BR>Can anyone pinpoint how many major foundries this involves? <BR> <BR> <BR>(Theater of the Absurd 2):  <BR> <BR>There are dozens of companies that digitize handwriting and make it into a font. These are not type designers buy they make a living designing, er, compiling type. <BR> <BR>(Theater of the Absurd 3): <BR> <BR>Hasn't every major profession been featured in a film or movie or book? Are there any instances of a type designer being portrayed in any of these mediums? What about a lettering artist? <BR> <BR> <BR>&quot;I am not a type designer, but I play one on TV.&quot; <BR> <BR>bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I think we're counting people who earn most of their income from type design, right? <BR> <BR>No. <BR>Just looking at the title of this thread -not to mention pretty much all the posts until its revival (we might also discuss the real -and very petty- reasons for that revival, two full months after the thread had died down)- should make it clear that we're talking about MAKING A LIVING. If you cut my income to 51% of what it is now, you can bet I would no longer be making even *close* to a living. People don't save up big chunks of what they make to account for their field running low on money. They *spend* it, and/or &quot;ramp up&quot; their lifestyle. For example, I can think of a co-owner of a medium-sized font house who certainly makes some money from his/her own designs (maybe even 51% - although that would surprise me greatly), but if you cut his/her income from the fonts of *others* in the library, his/her whole life would fall apart! That person might be on *your* list, but never on *this* one. <BR> <BR>Now, why do I insist that the list be restricted to people who can live as they expect to live *exclusively* through type design? Not because I want the list to be very short. Believe me, what would make me most happy is if I could justify devoting more time to this wonderful craft. It's because: <BR>1. This thing needs as much focus as it can get. Any extra arbitrariness (like going for your &quot;most of his income&quot;) would make this much trickier than it already is, much trickier than it needs to be. <BR>2. It's the friggin' point of the whole thread! <BR> <BR>Now, if you want to have a list that includes people who make only &quot;most&quot; of their income through type design, or even merely &quot;some&quot; of their income, or if you want to make a list of &quot;insiders&quot; (ignoringing that knowing people and things about people does *not* make you somebody who designs type for a living), then that's fine, do whatever turns you on. Start your own thread, and I even promise to take it seriously. But please don't derail *this* effort. <BR> <BR>&gt;What you seem to want to count is anything that supports your initial assertion that there were 10 full time type designers in the world. <BR> <BR>You're warping what I said, and you know it (unless I was wrong to give you that compliment in my previous post). And this reinforces my suspicion that you are doing something you've repeatedly accused *me* of: harboring an agenda. <BR> <BR>Good night. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Does it matter, at the end of the day, if Jean-François makes more money than Susana? If Emigre is better known for their magazine or their fonts? The fact of the matter, I think, is that there are tons of good type designers out there and we should simply know about them and learn from them, not discuss if they are/are not full time, bona fide type designers. Its kinda silly and a real wanking waste of time.  <BR>And just for the sake of going on to the name dropping band wagon, here are a few names: <BR> <BR>- Chester (definitely a type designer making a living out of it) <BR>- patric king (I don't think he is with Thirstype anymore) <BR>- Rick Valicenti (I rest my case) <BR>- Patrick Giasson (working in London as a type designer and creator of Oz) <BR> <BR>From <A HREF="http://www.thirstype.com/" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.thirstype.com/">http://www.thirstype.com/</a></A></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I dont think anyone have mentioned the norwegian designer,Magnus Rakeng. Even if he do graphic design in a broader sence than just typography I would assume that his first 5 five fonts have contributed to his living.(His five fonts are: Pilot, Envy, Superduper, Radio and Telenor)  <BR>Telenor is designed exclusivly for Norways largest tele-company Telenor&hellip;.its a sweet delight<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">) His other fonts can be bougth at Thirst&hellip; <BR> <BR>You could alwys visit his domain at: <BR><A HREF="http://www.melkeveien.no/magnus-rakeng/" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.melkeveien.no/magnus-rakeng/">http://www.melkeveien.no/magnus-rakeng/</a></A> <BR>Melkeveien being his new company: <BR><A HREF="http://www.melkeveien.no" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.melkeveien.no">http://www.melkeveien.no</a></A> <BR> <BR>Sbo</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Luce, <BR> <BR>While some of the arguments in this thread have  <BR>taken a contentious or ludicrous route I'm not <BR>sure it's a wanking waste of time to discuss the <BR>state of the type industry.

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, <BR>I agree completely, but I feel like a lot that is happening in this thread is more ranting and self-pity or angry lashing or abc-grade statements than a serious discussion on pitfalls and solutions to/for/by the industry.

		<div class="commentbody">&hellip;and some more clarification from me. it's actually quite frightening how most of the people participating in this thread have no idea what they're talking about. And we haven't heard much from actual typedesigners on those lists, apart from jonathan. <BR> <BR>First: <BR>let's distinguish between getting paid for designing a typeface, like a corporate font for a one-off fee, then the residual income from royalties, and finally income from retail sales of libraries.  <BR> <BR>In the case of emigre, for example, zuzanna licko earns royalties from the sales of her fonts as do other designer who have designs with that foundry &ndash; eg john downer et al. Zuzanna also makes money from the retail business as she is one of the owners of the company. <BR> <BR>Another example: Roger Black. While Roger has never designed a typeface in his life (how did he ever make that list?), he is still a partner in FontBureau who make their money from both selling retail type and designing special commissions. So Roger makes money from type, but isn't a type designer.  <BR> <BR>And a last one: Erik Spiekermann. The residuals of my fonts &ndash; FF Meta, FF Info, ITC Officina, even the fonts I did for Berthold 25 years ago, but not from Harvey Hunt who doesn't pay designers &ndash; could provide a handsome living if I didn't spend so much money on international flights and if I could be sure those fonts would sell forever. I also design typefaces on an exclusive basis for a one-off fee. Recently that was the case for Nokia, where I just did some rough digital concepts and Monotype did the rest. Then, as a partner in FontShop International, I would receive an income it we didn't spend all the money on fighting Harvey Hunt's legal cases against us and our designers. Until 2 years ago, I was a partner in MetaDesign and designed typefaces for clients of that company, helped by &ndash; amonst others &ndash; our resident typedesigners like Lucas de Groot, Ole Schäfer, Albert Pingerra, Erik van BLokland, Just van Rossum et al, who all got paid a wage but no license fees for the fonts MetaDesign did for our clients like Volkswagen, Audi, Heidelberg etc. <BR> <BR>FontFont designers get 20% of retail, and most other foundries pay similar fees. If you have bestseller, you can make a few thousand dollars a month. There are, however, not many bestsellers out there that sell over a long period of time. And designers like Adrian Frutiger have old contracts with Linotype paying much less than 20%.  In fact, if Adrian was on 20%, he'd be a millionaire. Unfortunately, a few foundries sold their libraries to distributors for a one-off fee (like ITC did to Linotype afew years ago), so the designes got a few dollars once, but now only the distibutor earns. If you buy ITC Officina from Linotype, I don't get a penny, but if you buy it from Agfa, I get 20%. <BR> <BR>Out of the dozens of typedesigners who have their work represented by FontShop International, only a dozen or so could have lived off their royalties, at least for a while. <BR> <BR>The confusion stems mainly from the fact that design and production have merged, and in some cases the designers and producers are also the retailers. Gerard Unger has a few faces with other libraries but also sells some of them from his home as a one-man foundry. He still designs for commissions (like the Dutch Highway Authority) and also works as a freelance graphic designer. <BR> <BR>So strangely, while all the typedesigners I know also do other work, there are some people who make a living entirely from selling fonts: all those who work for a foundry. And Clive is totall right with his estimate of maybe 600 people making a living out of font sales worldwide. Clive is totally wrong with giving me credit as a designer and not as a typedesigner. These days, it's the other way round.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Erik! Thanks so much for your clarifications. In defence of my own ignorance on the subject of earning a living as a type designer; it was never through want of asking. When I was designing type nobody ever gave me any idea how much I might make off any royalty agreement I might sign except for those who offered an up front advance on royalties. (Is it only ITC that still does this?) Frankly, from almost every design company that ever bothered to respond to my questions about type design - the technicalities of production and the business side - I got what ammounted to snide amusement at my lack of knowledge, as if I was simply not in the club and never going to get in either. (Evidently they were right.) I'm not complaining about the whole self-educated aspect of type design which seems to be the common denominator amongst designers, great and small. And I don't wish to sound like I'm whining about a lack of commercial success. But until the internet came along and people began to share information on the technicalities, at least, type design was for me, work in a dark vaccuum, where no sound or light seemed to enter or leave. It was a mystery to me how font companies ever got any new designs, because the last thing they seemed to be doing was giving the eager designer any helpful advice.  <BR> <BR>On the subject of actual dollar amounts earned: I'm not about to ask a designer to show me their bank statements, but can't someone, somewhere show us some figures? E.g. how many units of a bestseller were sold over a certain period of time; and perhaps for comparison the figures on a very average-selling font.</div>
