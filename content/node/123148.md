body: "The pics are of a piece of paper I used to do a rubbing over an engraved plaque
  on the front of our sailboat. I used a black crayon to rub over the letters. The
  boat was built in Taiwan in the 70's and I believe was delivered to England in 1976.
  \ The name of the boat is \"Seance\" and I think it was named and registered in
  England. So, I imagine these wooden plaques with the engraved name where made at
  that time. We have purchased 2 more sailboats and I'd like to have similar plaques
  made, using the same font but I can't figure out what it is. Any help would be greatly
  appreciated. Thanks : )\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"
