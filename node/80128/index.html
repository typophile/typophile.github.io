  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings fellow font lovers,

I'm working on a campaign to raise support for the Congo.The client wants to use the attached font (ignore the kerning...they sent it to me that way) as our primary display face. I like the fact that it doesn't look too slick, but it just feels too amateurish and off to me. And that "R"!

Can you possibly suggest alternates? Something that has a primal, tribal, handmade feel, is somewhat bold, conveys a bit of urgency? Nothing cliché, of course.

Any ideas would be most appreciated!

Thanks, folks.

In this case, Neville Brody was referencing the neat but unsophisticated sign lettering of small town midwest USA in the 1930s, the locale of many of John Dillinger's bank robberies.

This contemporary official Dillinger poster suggests another design tactic, wrong font:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dillingerwantedposter_5636.jpg]
As well as off-center centering and kerning off.

Mr. Shinn ... one of my typographic heroes: I love the Brody reference. Very inspired. And the homemade feel of the Dillinger poster with its off-centered content and woeful kerning leads to lots of ideas.

As always, this community came through. Thanks again for taking the time and being so generous.

		<div class="commentbody">Ick. Never mind the qualities of the typeface, the descriptions of "African-inspired" typefaces seem to be the last places in the world you're still allowed to spew out racist stereotypes. In a sensitive, more subtle and conversational way, I think using traditional art motifs from Africa could work in a typeface, but in general it's horrendously heavy-handed, full of ideas that Africa is particularly rough, primitive, tribal, dark...

African design, espeically these days, is probably just as hypermodernist as anything in Europe. I'm not familiar enough with contemporary congolose stuff to really bring that up, but if I had to pick one font to represent (say) Nigeria it'd probably be Helvetica Extra Bold Compressed, probably (unfortunately) with some sort of metallic effect.

Here's a blog with dozens of Nigerian record covers, for some more looks of what's happening in Africa right now:

It's not as if those qualities aren't quite prevalent in the West, where dumb-ass techno fonts, crappy distressed fonts and godawful script scrawls have a lot of cachet. Anti-corporate cred. And then there's Comic Sans.

Consider the process by which we pick "Girly" fonts (sexist), "Fun" fonts for teens (demeaning) and "Upscale" fonts (elitist).
How is Neuland different? Its sin seems to be the taint of cliché, which is something only the trade is aware of.</div>

That's nice. What's been asked for are typographic suggestions for a "campaign to raise support for the Congo" not emulate contemporary Congolese design, which you don't know what it looks like, and neither does the audience, but I can almost assure you looks about like it does in your example, and as it does in much design from Bakersfield to Barneveld and beyond, meaningless sans, rudely composed.

Now Tintoretto, that really makes me think of Africa, sitting at an Italian bistro on The River.;)
