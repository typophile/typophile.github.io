  body: "feh. \r\n\r\nDigital whiteboard technology has been around\u2013and sucked\u2013for
    at least five years. The intuitive drawing interface has been done before\u2013take
    a look at Alias Sketchbook Pro\u2013and Pixar created a similar program with automatic
    vectorization while working on <em>The Incredibles</em>. An automated 2d physics
    simulation program is next to useless for most people, and those who would want
    one are going to need to stop constantly and plug in new variables at the keyboard,
    making the giant drawing area useless.\r\n\r\nWIMP still wins. "

    computer GUI that came out of Xerox PARC in the late 70s/early 80s and was \u201Cperfected\u201D
    by Microsoft, Apple, and other software companies that helped define what GUIs
    came to be. Combined with CLUI it's created a computing experience that has generally
    not been beaten; although in certain circumstances\u2013especially interfaces
    for the handicapped or tablet drawing\u2013better things have come along. "
