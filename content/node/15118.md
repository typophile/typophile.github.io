  body: "A long-defunct publication \"The Colophon\". Case bound; great quality type
    and printing. This book was produced quarterly from the 20's to the mid 30's I
    think. It can be found at most antiquarian book stores. There are printed submissions
    by Goudy, Dwiggins, Bruce Rogers, Press of the Wooley Whale, Peter Pauper Press,
    etc. \r\n\r\nThey usually run about $25 a copy but are well worth it.\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n "
