  body: "It seems to be a problem related with the weightClass value, as Thomas said,\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weightClass_6194.png]\r\n\r\nor
    italic angle value,\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/italicAngle_4886.png]\r\n\r\nor
    perhaps both.\r\n\r\nBTW, it's uncommon to have a style named \"Regular Italic\".
    Usually it's just \"Italic\"."

  body: WeightClass values weren't set properly. I've fixed them and now it put them
    in a different (still incorrect) order. Will look into italic angle values.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture5_3522.jpg]
