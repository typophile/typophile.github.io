body: "I purchased Heroic Condensed the other day, and installed it with Suitcase
  Fusion 3.  For some reason, when I go to use the font in InDesign, Illustrator or
  Photoshop, the weights are listed like this:\r\n\r\nBlack\r\nBlack Oblique\r\nBold\r\nBold
  Oblique\r\nBook\r\nHeavy\r\nHeavy Oblique\r\nLight\r\nMedium\r\nRegular Oblique\r\nThin\r\nBook
  Oblique\r\nLight Oblique\r\nMedium Oblique\r\nThin Oblique\r\nRegular\r\n\r\nAnd
  that's just confusing.  How can I get them to display from Thin to Black Oblique?
  \ Or at the very least, keep the weights next to their obliques, or list the weights
  alphabetically.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the font? This might be a font naming problem.

  body: "No, I haven't, I thought the problem must be on my end.\r\n\r\nOn a similar
    note, I bought a family of three fonts (The Strangelove Next family from Veer)
    and they show up as three separate entries, rather than one family with three
    weights. Any idea if I can fix that or again, do I have to contact the foundry/distributor? "

  body: It looks like the Heroic foundry has not included numeric values for fonts
    weights in the font specs, with the result that the application sorts them alphabetically,
    roman first, then italic.

  body: "The funny thing is that it's not even alphabetical... it's got \r\n\r\nRegular
    Oblique\r\nThin\r\n\r\nand then later\r\n\r\nThin Oblique\r\nRegular\r\n\r\nnot
    to mention the obliques being all over the place.\r\n\r\nI've e-mailed MyFonts,
    but I suppose I'll have to contact TypeTrust / Silas Dilworth directly and try
    to get an updated file.  Is this a common problem with buying fonts outside of
    the usual Adobe packages?  I've only purchased about 7-8 families, and I've had
    issues like this with a couple now. \r\n"

    pleased customer. Now to Veer to check on the Strangelove font issue!
