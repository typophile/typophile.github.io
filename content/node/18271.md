body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if someone could help me. I used two
  different fonts for this invitation. I think one of them is \"Poetica\" (don't know
  for sure) and the other? I made this by hand (cutting out the letters and sticking
  them onto another piece of paper and making a copy of that), so there is no electronic
  file left too look at. \r\n\r\nI want to make a new invitation using the same type,
  but I want to make it in Indesign at my school so if your looking at this and have
  an opinion about the (mis)use of these two fonts together feel free to comment.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for reading any help greatly appreciated."

    we could not remember or deduce wich font it was. I'm going to write it down from
    now on so I can remember.

  body: "I'm sorry I don't, Poetica is close just looks a bit narrow, at least the
    letters do the numerals look about right, could you have expanded them slightly?\r\nBest
    answer is to try posting it in the type i.d. forum and see if anyone can positively
    id it.\r\nTim"
