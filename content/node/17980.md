  who uses various weights of Lubalin Graph for all printed communication.\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to replace the Lubalin with a crisp Pixel font for the use in Flash etc. -
  any recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    www.bestflashanimationsite.com, but nothing came even close. About Hrant fonts,
    could you please post a link where i can find some of his? They prove difficult
    to find.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    whose <a href=\"http://www.ultrafonts.com/\">website</a> seems not to let you
    past the splash page at the moment.\r\n\r\nHe has a demo on his <a href=\"http://themicrofoundry.com\">The
    Microfoundry</a> webiste, <a href=\"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nHrant
