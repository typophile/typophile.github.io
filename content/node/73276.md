body: "As the topic subject suggests, the closest matches I could find for this font
  were Bradley Pro by Profonts and Fyne Fish by Nick Curtis. Now, I would be inclined
  to say that the latter would be the best match, but the typeface used in this logo
  (which belongs to the gothic industrial band Lestat) was used by them since the
  early 90s, and both Bradley Pro and Fyne Fish NF were designed and released in the
  noughties.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lestat-band-logo_5532.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
  is the cover of their album Grave Desires which was released in the early 90s.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lestat

    of it (there are others too). Quote: \xBBBRADLEY is an 1895 typeface credited
    to Joseph Warren Phinney (1848-1934). It was based on lettering by Henry William
    Bradley (1869-1962) for a Christmas cover of Harper's Bazaar magazine. Bradley
    was the basis for logotypes such as Firestone and Ketel One, and has also been
    widely used by Disney on theme park signage.\xAB"

  body: "Interesting, Renko. A very similar typeface was used on the cover of the
    first edition of the novel Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice which was published
    in 1976.\r\nDo you know the names of any of the \"others\" you mentioned?"
