body: "hi,\r\n\r\nmy name is juliano and this is my first entry at typophile. i would
  like to invite all of you to my typefoundry website: www.fonduefontes.com.br\r\n\r\nfondues
  fontes is the result of my graduation final project, and became my first shot to
  the world of typograph. the budget of fondue fontes is to capture some concepts
  from the streets and bring it up to digital fonts. the fonts are avaliable for sale
  for a very low price. what we want is to make a revolution in the brasilian design
  scene (i\xB4m brazilian). here in brasil people don\xB4t use to buy fonts, because
  a lot of things, but, specially because of the font price.\r\n\r\nwe\xB4ll talk
  more about it later.\r\n\r\nhappy to be here,\r\n\r\njuliano[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cart\xE3o02verso_4106.jpg]"
