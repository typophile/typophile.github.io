body: "I am looking for a resource that illustrates and comprehensively describes
  the unicodes for modern Gaelic. It would also be cool if there were samples of the
  standard glyphs, diacritics, and most common alternates. Also very cool would be
  charts or diagrams to break these up into Irish, Welsh, and Scottish Gaelic. Evidently,
  there are some differences. The information I've been able to gather covers more
  archaic versions with no real concern for typography or type design.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJames"
