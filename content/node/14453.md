  body: Kyle why don't you find examples that frame the context of your idea and post
    them, it would help focus the thoughts. Wells Fargo CI was based on the west of
    the Gold Miners not the west of the Cowboys. They make that very clear in their
    CI manual.

  body: We're laughing, but telling the client it's a 'house' font would actually
    make an easy sale. Real Estate agents are into that hokey type thing. Might as
    well have fun with it.

    bills don't laugh at type jokes.
