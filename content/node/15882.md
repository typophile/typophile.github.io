body: "Looking for suggestions for a face to cover the basic needs of a university
  gallery. My old school needs some help so I'm going to attempt to assist. The director
  likes letterpress, so we are off on a good foot.\r\n\r\nNeeds would be signage on
  walls (largest), wall texts, invitations, postcards and brochures for exhibits.\r\n\r\nI've
  set the gallery name in Dolly bld, and like the idea of a serif that is versatile
  with a little flavor, but feel the bold would fare better at large sizes than the
  small caps.\r\n\r\nThey are using Akzidenz Grot at the moment.\r\n\r\nLooks like
  Freight could be very useful for this application.\r\n\r\nAlso, newsprint stock
  may be in the mix as a low-cost option for some publications."

    my shoe?\r\n\r\nMaybe I should ask about observed trends in gallery identities,
    and what people feel is appropriate. I can see a need to be somewhat neutral as
    a background for the art.\r\n"

  body: "It\u2019s an art gallery associated with a university. It is in a museum
    district on the ground floor of a medical complex. It is a small space that will
    be used by curatorial students. Typically the focus will be on works by artists
    associated with the university. The current show is called \"Symbiotic\" and features
    the work of grads and ex-students that work in local museums. The writing is also
    covered by grads and ex-students that work in the editorial and art writing end
    of the museum district."

  body: "I'd approach this from the starting point of the captions in a catalogue.\r\nI've
    always loved that typography -- where you get the title of the artwork, the artist,
    the work's dimensions, etc. It's hardcore geek typography where you get to fool
    around with the interplay of roman, italic, small caps, and figures.\r\n\r\nSo
    if your client is into the letterpress thing, Bembo was the primo face for that
    kind of setting. I'm not saying use Bembo, but just follow that old-school vibe.
    As one of the first digital sans faces to include a full set of expert features,
    I've used Scala Sans for that sort of thing, and it works very well. But there
    are so many more faces now.\r\n\r\nOf my own, I would recommend Bodoni Egyptian;
    not a sans, but a slab-serif face may be a good candidate for \"neutral\". And
    Thin weights look good big on a wall.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Bodoni_GIFS/Bod.pdf"

  body: "To clarify, she had seen work for the Chinati foundation designed by Rutger
    Fuchs that was letterpress. After some light discussion of budget she also mentioned
    the newsprint.\r\n\r\nThe Kimbell next door uses Bembo if I'm not mistaken. I'm
    thinking the letterpress might come to pass later when more of the grants are
    in, but I'm trying to steer in economical directions, and help create an identity.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a student gallery, which serves a very different purpose than the lofty institutions
    that surround it.\r\n\r\nThanks again for any input. I don't have peer review.
    Current feedback = modern."

    I should start this again when I get it out of the oven. I'm looking at Formata

    bar in the \"t\" is \"pinched\", like a tight belt (especially on top). And the
    top of the (closed) bowl of the \"a\" seems to have a small trap.\r\n\r\nBut really,
    it depends on the effect you want - you might think those\r\nfeatures (although
    the latter trap, unlikely) are part of the \"look\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Ok. This is a book face. IMO (and also stated by the designer) the bold makes
    a nice display. I see the quirks as process clues, like seeing an artists fingerprint
    in paint or seeing sketch lines under paint. My biggest reservation about this
    face is that it has some of these issues, and particularly the small caps, which
    looks so nice in smaller sizes, seems too much at display sizes (not easy to see
    in my example).\r\n\r\nI think the bowl of the \u201Ca\u201D  would benefit from
    refinement. I don't know if I have the chops to work out the \u201Ct\u201D and
    actually improve it for display. I think I've got the hots for Dolly bold really.
    A clear sign I need to leave her and take a night off.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMark"

    mistakes and getting to a point where he felt good leaving those parts visible,
    showing the workings and false starts. I don't think ink traps in any way are
    false starts, but when you blow type up like that you see what it is made of,
    which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Something to notice for those that care. Not much
    for those that don\u2019t. "
