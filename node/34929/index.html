Duh. All the other phones can carry secret computer and network-destroying viruses that will make mankind susceptible to devastating attacks from cybernetic beings. Or something like that… 8-D

But isn't <em>Galactica</em> set in the present, or even the past? Once the remnants of the 12 colonies find us on Earth, we can give them the iPhone. I'm sure that it could even win over the Cylons. After they interface with it, they would certainly loose all interest in dominating humanity.</div>

I just get the torrents. I feel justified since Doctor Who is paid for in part by the immoral expropriation of private funds. And because I’m too geeky to wait three months for the Daleks to get to the states.</div>

I will admit, I do not like cell phones, but I own one simply because my monthly cell bill is less than 1/2 the cost of just having a land line, never mind calling long distance. cell = $42 with features, landline = $80 just to have it plus $1.25/min long distance.

		<div class="commentbody">Patty,

I do have a cell phone - but honestly, it is only used in the car...and only if I'm not the one driving.

AT&T where we are has very little power, I can't even use an AT&T cell phone from my home - no signal.

As for calls on a "digital" situation - I love SKYPE. I call my family in England - and it's crystal clear. My stepson calls his friend in Korea on it - complete with cameras to they can see each other and have a grand conversation.

There is always new technology around the corner - but I really feel Apple has hurt themselves on this one. By keeping it exclusive to AT&T cuts a huge hunk out of the market - and by informing us that this is "first generation" with new improvements to be sold shortly - well, I don't want to be the first kid on the block anymore.

I'm a big fan of Apple - but this product just isn't for me.

And on a personal note to jselig - check with your phone company. Mine offered me a great savings by combining Internet with Cable TV with phone - and they threw in all the long distance phone call making I can handle to the USA mainland -- which j'adore!</div>

It's cool though that people will line up around the block to see it, buy it, and talk about it while other companies have to chase down, rope, brand and serial number customers just to get them to "try it." 6 months after vista, e.g. most people at MS were/are still resisting their own product, and only about 7% of users have moved on to it.

		<div class="commentbody">I've been on vacation since last week, but I stopped at an Apple store in DesMoines last Friday and got one. I like it a lot. Typing is fine. The screen is beautiful. It's not as cool when AT&T coverage and WiFi is lacking (unsurprisingly). The reason I decided to get it was so I could carry fewer gadgets without losing their usefulness. Instead of having to choose between  carrying a cell phone, a Palm Pilot, an iPod, a pocket camera, and a note pad, I can have all five in one tiny device. Having the Internet too is icing on the cake.

		<div class="commentbody">I grabbed one the day it came out, and I absolutely love it, warts and all. It's by far the best mobile user experience I've seen. Its light years ahead of an industry who still believes that the way to sell more devices is to pack them with even more features that users will never find or use.

Despite its criticisms, Apple's entry into the mobile market will transform the industry - of that I'm convinced. Suddenly the conversation has changed from form factor to user experience, and that's long overdue.

Re iPhone (I read Apple calls it iPhone, not THE iPhone): Apparantly Apple plans to service the bigger European countries first, so we Dutch will have to wait. And even then — the European version of iPhone will be more advanced than the US-version (no oldfashioned EDGE overhere, but UMTS) and probably in need of better energy management, so I'll wait for the kinks that will cause to be ironed out.
But yes, I do want one.

My new pal Jona's been on tour over here this week and has been blogging/twittering non-stop (http://www.teamyacht.com/) via his iPhone, hitting up wi-fi signals left and right, despite a lack of phone service abroad. 

Dragging a laptop around Tokyo looking for a signal sucks, and as you get away from the urban center, you are pretty much screwed to find a decent free signal. While I'll be forced to wait a while to hook one up, I'm pretty convinced. But then again, ATT isn't on this side of the Pacific...</div>

I had totally written off the need to get an iPhone since I have a very capable Samsung Blackjack (see my user experience critique of the <a href="http://idlemode.com/2007/06/29/user-experience-critiquesamsung-blackjack/">Blackjack at Idlemode</a>.) But, having hefted one, and resized a web page and watched the screen scale in real-time... I'm now eating my words and jonesing for one badly.

It really does change the game. Windows Mobile -- with it's chunky pixel icons, its bitmap fonts, and it's lack of transitions -- by comparison feels about 10 years old when you're holding an iPhone in your hand. I feel sorry for anyone who has to make calls on a RAZR.

Back to reality for a second... I think I'm still committed to waiting for the second gen iPhone when it's on a real (3G) network and when I can get more storage for my $599.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How about a resolution discussion? Or b/w vs. anti-aliased?.... 

I have a RAZR and the type and icons on it look horrible. They aren't anti-aliased, and it feels a little like they had a few million of these low-res displays sitting around they needed to unload. For a recent phone, it looks awful, and the usability is bad as well. What would essentially be "back" on an iPhone is here called "Exit", "Done", "Cancel", or "Back," depending what scrambled menu you're in. I won't be getting an iPhone soon; the timing is wrong and I've never been an early adopter, but I'm relishing the idea that the usability of it will prod other phone makers to improve. I'm waiting for the same improvements Joe is. 

I have to say I've been hearing raves from everyone I know who got one. The camera blows all my previous phone cameras away. Talk about resolution! </div>

Snip from Reuters:

Apple Inc. plans to launch a cheaper version of the iPhone in the fourth quarter that could be based on the ultra-slim iPod Nano music player, according to a JP Morgan report.

Kevin Chang, a JP Morgan analyst based in Taiwan, cited people in the supply channel he did not name and an application with the U.S Patent and Trademark office for his report dated July 8.

Apple filed a patent application document dated July 5 that refers to a multifunctional handheld device with a circular touch pad control, similar to the Nano's scroll wheel.</div>

1. A great alarm clock.

Top uses for my second-hand HTC phone. 

1. A great alarm clock.
