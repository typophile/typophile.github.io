  body: Can't help directly. Only thing I'd mention, and you probably already know
    it, is that the "good and clean" notoin is fine, the "template" might give pause
    for thought. If the website itself is simply a vehicle to distribute products
    people already want to buy, template is fine. However, if it is intended to aid
    in sales, that's a different matter.

  body: "I was just researching more-or-less this issue a couple of weeks ago. I was
    specifically looking at e-commerce solutions for WordPress, with priority on ease
    of implementation, and low-cost or free solutions. So I was looking only at WordPress-based
    solutions. Don't knock this if you are unfamiliar with it\u2014WordPress is a
    lot more than just a blogging platform.\r\n\r\nMy conclusions, based on reviews
    and ratings:\r\n\r\n- if you want the option to do physical goods as well, \u201CReady!
    e-commerce\u201D is one of the easiest and best options.\r\n- if you really want
    to only do digital downloads, \u201CEasy Digital Downloads\u201D is definitely
    the best thing out there, and easier to use than any of the platforms that also
    do physical goods. It does one thing very well.\r\n\r\nBoth offer more features
    for extra money."
