  constructive criticism of how it looks.\r\n\r\nSometimes I don't know what font
  to use and I think I'm using too many. If you guys could provide some input and
  suggestions I would really appreciate it. Anything helps I what to really improve
  it for the month of April. One of the challenges is that it has to be bi-lingual
  so it's kinda hard to do diferent layouts.\r\n\r\nIt's in pdf format this is the
  direct link:\r\n\r\nhttp://vidanueva.cc/spanish/recursos.../Feb%20NLC.pdf\r\n\r\nI
  really want to improve my typography skill specialy since I found this site.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help"

  body: "One piece of advice: I think you're right with the too many fonts idea. Try
    to cut down on all the different fonts - consistency doesn't have to be boring.\r\n\r\nEven
    on the cover if you could take out one of the fonts and re-use one of the other
    ones, it would eliminate some of the clutter that is facing you in the rest of
    the project. You could also turn the March & April section into 2 columns and
    fill that space while opeing up the rest below for more white space.\r\n\r\nAnd
    watch out for that white on yellow stuff, I can barely read it and that's on the
    computer, it won't get better when printed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n"

    body: "Yeah I took note on the white on yellow. The crazy thing is I've done that
      before.\r\n\r\nAnything else. I really want you guys to critique this thing
      like crazy. I rally feel the need to improve on a personal level.\r\n\r\nAbout
      making two colums of the future events I thought of that but I wanted both March
      and April as sudheads and their weren't enough dates for April. \r\n\r\nAny
      suggestions on the body text I should use or anything like that?\r\n"

  body: "For the Future Events section I'm using Ariel. Is there a better font I could
    use instead? I know a lot of people don't like it(I guess cause it's real common).
    \r\n\r\nAlso I use Ariel for that page then for all other body text on other pages
    I use Adobe Garomand Pro is that OK?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Kristian,\r\n\r\nThe reason most people don't like it is because it's a MS
    knock-off of a solid sans, you may know. HELVETICA. MS decided they didn't want
    to pay menial licensing fees to use it, so they commissioned someone to make something
    nearly like it. \r\n\r\nThat being said, type should be designed for need, or
    specific use in the aesthetic realm. Getting around licensing fees isn't considered
    an aesthetic need,therefore it is considered weak. There is a bit of difference,
    the tops of the t's are chopped off, the leg of the R is different etc... I think
    part of has to do with overuse, I just prefer to use the real thing. Set a block
    of text in Arial and then in Helvetica, and see which reads better. \r\n\r\nGaramond
    in good body text. I'd have to agree w/ Nick on the too many fonts end. Do you
    have any kind of budget in the printing dept. you could talk into buying nice
    display family? I think if you get a nice modern sans with a bit more character
    that Arial/Helvetica.\r\n\r\n\r\nEric"

  body: I switched everything that was Ariel to Myriad Pro. I think it looks much
    better. Also it has a lot of variations so I can use Myriad Pro and Adobe Garamond
    Pro for most of the Nesletter.
