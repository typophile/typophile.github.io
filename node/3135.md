  Today when I saw these guys it finally registered that Google does holiday fun.
  Any bets we&#39;ll see Lincoln and Washington on Monday? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26532.gif"

  body: Thanks Grant, for the link. I was sorta wondering why the Os in the logo weren&#39;t
    two linked hearts. Now I know it&#39;s because that&#39;s what they did last year.
    And sorry Google, no more posting of your holiday logos anywhere, anytime, ever
    again. <BR> <BR>BTW, it wasn&#39;t snowmen on New Years Day, but I do remember
    seeing them.
