  body: "The digital versions by [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/trieste/ef-medium/characters.html|Elsner+Flake]]
    and Scangraphic both have an alternate 'g' that does not match your sample. The
    showing of Kleukens Antiqua in Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" does
    show the same g as your sample. This makes me guess that your sample was made
    with a pre-digital version (either film type or metal).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Ha, there is a Philip Bouwsma face at Linotype that I found on my first look,
    quite different, but close enough that it was just possible that it was what you
    were referring to. It's at [[http://www.linotype.com/181048/trieste-family.html]].
    But you are right, the EF version is virtually identical except for the 'g'. There
    is a less refined version of the Kleukens at MyFonts [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kleukens-antiqua-nf/|here]],
    but it does have the right 'g'.

    one, and I didn't know he used the other 'g', so thanks for that info.\r\n\r\n-
