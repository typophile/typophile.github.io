body: 'I am currently use FontLab 5.1.4 on Mac OS Yosemite. According to the manual
  and my preference settings, I''m supposed to be able to move selected nodes with
  arrow keys by one unit per "click." However, when I try to just tap an arrow key
  nothing happens. The nodes will only move if I hold down the arrow keys, which then
  they move appropriately. However, the necessity to hold down the keys is preventing
  me from moving them 1 unit at a time. I need to be able to just tap the arrow keys.
  Holding them down makes the nodes move too quickly. I have scoured the preferences,
  menus, the manual and internet for a solution, but to no avail. Any ideas? '

    flakiness of FS somewhere else]] in the forum, I realized that I never tried to
    quit and reopen FontLab. Turns out, that was the case! It works as expected now.
