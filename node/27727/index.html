		<div class="commentbody">Not only do dashes vary in width from font to font, but also height and thickness. Some have built-in space on either side, while others don't. So like most things typographical, the trick is to get to know the typefaces you work with, and experiment to produce the best setting.

As a rule of thumb, if you're thinking about using an em dash and not quite sure about how it will work out for a particular setting, use the en-dash with a space either side instead.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick - beg to differ. As in the primer, the em and en dashes have very different functions, and should not be used interchangeably or have spaces around them. The en is a connecting dash; it represents a span of time or space. The em is a separating dash—to set apart a thought or idea. I do find that in some cases the em in particular is kerned too tight, but you can adjust those in the kerning tables (and I do).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">An em dash -- is simply a long dash. If it's too long for you, use an en dash or horizontally scale it (yes, it's okay to scale a rectangle).

Contrary to the P22 primer, the europeans generally use spaces (sometimes thin spaces) on either side of dashes, and I prefer it. No space creates visual tension for me. Many fonts need the room to breathe. As Nick said, all of this depends on the font, as some dashes are longer than others and some have sidebearings with space, some do not.

The only hard and fast rule is that you must remain consistent in your use throughout a piece or brand.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, I did use a hyphen, and often do when typing emails or other informal correspondence because I'm too lazy to do the shift option thingie. I also sometimes use all lowercase in email but that ain't correct typesetting either. And I use abbreviations and shorthand too altho (there's one) I wouldn't in a book or other printed piece.

As we have all noted there is a lot of variety in size of dashes but that's no excuse for poor typesetting. I do kern a little extra space around an em if it's too tight, which they often are. And yes it's cool to horizontally scale the dashes a bit to suit your taste, I've even created style sheets just for dashes. 

But the original question in this thread concerned usage and I'm old school—I think it's important to use dashes correctly and not mix them up.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patty, I recommend "space - en dash - space" for practical reasons, because as I said, emdash treatment varies so widely with typeface. For instance, this Futura em dash is really nasty, with no sidebearings and a long way from the vertical centre of the x-height. This is the kind of situation where "following the rules" will cause a typographer to do stuff which looks clumsy.
On the other hand, Electra's em dash has plenty of sidebearings, i.e. built-in spaces. No trouble there, but "space - en dash - space doesn't look bad either, so that setting works in both fonts.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dash2_3468.png]

For more experienced typographers, I would agree with you that the old school emdash with no added space is ideal, but may require nuancing, such as inserting some manual kerning or hair space, and maybe baseline shift, depending on the font and the typographer's taste.</div>

I am a stickler but also realize that the average Joe doesn't even know the difference. Of course the average Joe doesn't look at the front and back cover of a book together to notice how nicely you've balanced and lined up the various elements either. And wouldn't care that the fractions weren't converted or whether there were prime marks instead of smart quotes. Typesetting is a lonely business but I come from book publishing, where this kind of thing matters. And I'm not dumbing down for the average Joe.

On a similar note, what is the deal with ellipses? There's a keystroke for them (option semicolon) but when I get a manuscript it's always space-period-space-period-space-period. Then you have to deal with line breaks, etc. What is up with that????</div>

I just looked back at Bringhurst, which I got not quite accurate from memory. He says the m-dash for a 'phrase marker' is 'Victorian'. He says, "Like the oversized space between sentences, it belongs to the padded and corsetted aesthetic of Victorian Typography." I remember the use of the spaced n-dash from my years in England, and it is part of Tschichold's recommended style for Penguin. I suspect it is in other English style books, but I don't have any on hand. 

For dates, Bringhurst recommends en dashes without spaces, as is also American style, eg. in the Chicago Manual of Style. 

If I remember rightly from earlier Typophile discussions, Matthew Carter came up with the idea of three-quarter em dashes with spaces out to the em. Being a 'mid Atlantic' kind of guy, I guess this is apt. I think it is probably the best solution. Kent Lew wrote that in Whitman he did the Carter-style em dashes and also negatively kerned them so if keyed in successively they make a solid line.

This is nice, from 1940.
I believe it was written, or edited, with typographic appearance in mind.
There seems to be a variety of marks used for subordinate clauses:
-commas
-brackets (parentheses)
-dashes
The variety animates the setting, along with frequent paragraph breaks and italicization.
Dashes are used more often with quotations, perhaps to contrast with the quote marks themselves, whereas brackets are favoured for the author's text.

The dashes are narrow and the word spaces wide, compared with how it would usually be done today*, but as has been mentioned, the main thing is to find your style and be consistent -- readers will "get" it pretty quickly, because that's the kind of adjustment they make all the time, reading material as diverse as newspapers, magazines, books, advertisements, etc. So no need to dull down to some conservative ideal of what's considered most readable.

*a combination of the metrics (character widths) in the font, and the H&J setting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My two cents... (and I'm in Australia, so not sure where that fits in to British or American style, probably both)

I use an en dash to indicate a range, sometimes with a space, sometimes not (eg Mon–Fri, 9–5pm; 4 September – 5 October), depending on if the 'ranged' items also have spaces within them.

In extended text, I like the em-dash with hair spaces either side to indicate the change-of-thought. Although some editors that we use think that is an old-style approach and prefer spaced ens instead.

eliason - I think the difference in space between the dots within an ellipsis and a period that follows makes sense. Otherwise, it would look like an ellipsis with four dots? I'd even go so far as to insert a thin space to make the difference noticeable.

		<div class="commentbody">Cameron: yes, we're in agreement—the en connects and the em separates. I have yet to meet an editor who will allow any breach of that norm and I've been designing books for 20 years. I'm sure one can get away with more creative use of dashes in other contexts.

Tim: The point of the em dash is exactly that: to add a big gap. It represents a gap in thinking, a change in thought. I happen to like the width of the em in this font (Mercury is it?) It's too bad when it's either disproportionately wide or kerned too tight but those can be adjusted and should.

FYI (and I'm not sure where the Brits fit in) it is also common in Europe not to indent paragraphs, which I find makes for hard reading. </div>

But surely an experienced reader would use a comma or semi colon in the same way, for example in Nick’s print example I find it difficult to explain why the em dashes are used when a comma could do the same job, I don't really need to see the pause quite so forcefully.

True, but it also does its own thing. The colon and parenthesis are short and vertical, whereas the length of the em dash -- imagine oneself writing it -- provides urgency and continuity.

Dashes are also visual design elements, look at the symmetry and shape of:
"All right, boys--that's enough."

So much more attractive than:
"All right, boys: that's enough."

or:
"All right, boys, that's enough."
which lacks the forcefulness the text warrants.

although:
"All right boys, that's enough."
would be OK.

It's not enough to rely solely on grammatical rules and standards.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">that's all very interesting, i wasn't aware that there were cultural/national differences in usage of en-/em-dash.
I can only comment/add on the ‘traditional’ usage in germany:
the m-dash aka „Streckenstrich“ (something along the lines of ‘distance-stroke’) was to be used to designate a distance/span of time and space like „10—12 km“/„12—14.00 Uhr“; or to be used in amounts of money with no digits like „10,— Mark“. The interesting thing is that you almost never see it being used today, i suspect exactly because it is deemed too long, as stated above. When used, you rarely see it without small 1/8th- to 1/4th-em spaces over here.
Seeing the em-dash in use as described today to me makes quite a traditional, if not ‘reactionary’ impression, like using the st-ligature in body copy, if you get my drift; but of course it depends on the typeface being used, context, etc. I find the en-dash sufficient in most cases.
Apparently there is no reliable rule of thumb to be found here, as the design of both dashes varies too much from typeface to typeface.

Surely that is why we have <em> search and replace </em> functions; I never yet had an author's MS supplied that didn't require hours of tidying up prior to it being typeset… much of it is just about old typist's conventions. 

There was a really fine post by Jason Dewinetz just over a year ago at
http://typophile.com/node/12883 which might make good related reading to this thread.

<em>Not every computer has an Option key.</em>
Well ALT then alright.

<em> FYI (and I’m not sure where the Brits fit in) it is also common in Europe not to indent paragraphs, which I find makes for hard reading.</em>

I'm not at all sure where you get this from, Patty; all the Brit typos I know would be horrified by the absence of para indenting. As Cameron points out, plenty of (Brit) typesetting convention still persists in Australia (and New Zealand). In a situation where there is no indent, then surely there is a line break, an outdent, a pilcrow or a drop cap or some other method of signalling the para break, no?

As for the Europeans, I just can't imagine the likes of Spiekermann, Noordzij, Porchez et al really trying to make it hard for the reader to distinguish paragraphs.

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, yes indeed. John Gruber, author of Smarty Pants addresses the issue in the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">documentation</a>:

<blockquote>Algorithmic Shortcomings

One situation in which quotes will get curled the wrong way is when apostrophes are used at the start of leading contractions. For example:

	<blockquote>'Twas the night before Christmas.</blockquote>

In the case above, SmartyPants will turn the apostrophe into an opening single-quote, when in fact it should be a closing one. I don’t think this problem can be solved in the general case — every word processor I’ve tried gets this wrong as well. In such cases, it’s best to use the proper HTML entity for closing single-quotes (’ or ’) by hand.</blockquote></div>

In general, all you really have to do is determine when there are matching pairs and when there aren't. In practice, it can of course get tricky (and the parsing can get pretty hairy), but it's currently possible to do an excellent job.

I say "excellent" as opposed to "perfect". Doing a perfect job, while not theoretically impossible, would require perfect natural-language processing, which is a Very Hard AI challenge that we haven't yet overcome.

BTW, the job is much easier for software like SmartyPants than it is for, say, Microsoft Word. That's because Word does it in real-time (as you type), while SmartyPants has the luxury of processing the full text at once.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's no longer a matching pair. The first apostrophe is followed by a digit, which weights the probability heavily in favor of it being an apostrophe. The second apostrophe has an <cite>s</cite> before it and a space afterwards (and no punctuation), which similarly increases its probability being an apostrophe rather than a closing quotation mark. This evidence, taken together, allows us to make a reasonable guess that we have two unconnected apostrophes. The guess may sometimes turn out to be wrong, but in most cases -- as in this one -- it will be correct.
