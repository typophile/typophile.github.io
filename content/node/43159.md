  a new problem that some of you might know the solution to...\r\n\r\nA customer wanted
  to use one of my fonts in Microsoft's 'Word' software (don't know why, but I didn't
  ask) and he noticed that -while having been generated at the same time with the
  same settings- the Truetype version works fine, and the Opentype version does show
  up in the font menu, but when typing with the font it displays another (deffault?)
  font. \r\nHas anyone heard of this problem before? Or is there some setting that
  I might have overlooked while generating the font? Or maybe is it in the 'Word'
  software, which doesn't seem like a design environment?\r\n\r\nHope to be hearing
  from you soon.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and best regards,\r\nJoe"

    Gentium as both TT and OpenType loaded in WINDOWS\\fonts at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo
    the first thing I'd check is to see if having only one version at a time installed
    would help.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of people who post to the build forum who
    might better know what is going on, after the *bump*, maybe they'll grind out
    an answer"

    encountered the problem. In the meantime I have learned that the Opentype version
    can also be problematic when used on a Mac with OS 10.4.11. Do you know something
    about this? And may I ask what *bump* are you referring to?\r\n\r\nThanks again
    and best regards,\r\nJoe"

  body: "Bump -- \"move to the top.\"\r\n\r\nWhen your post had remained unanswered
    for a while, Miss Tiffany, a Typophile Froum moderator, made a post with only
    the word \"bump.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of that is to move the thread to the top
    of the stack, so people will continue to see your post & perhaps be able to give
    you an answer.\r\n\r\nI guess after I made the small note above, she deleted her
    \"bump\" post, as it had served its purpose."

  body: "I see, thanks for filling me in.\r\n\r\nOn topic: your suggestion seems to
    have solved at least part of the problem, but now I get error reports that say
    the font doesnt properly show and/ or work:\r\n\r\n\"In Word:\r\nThe font is listed
    (in it's style).  When I select the font, the resulting type in the font window
    and the document says dear Joe 4, but looks like a standard font.  It appears
    that it is not reading the font file, but is automatically substituting another
    font.\r\n\r\nIn Photoshop:\r\nThe font name does not even appear in the list.\r\n
    \r\nIn Corel Draw:\r\nThe font name appears in the list and the font works fine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    also:\r\n\r\n\"Testing the TrueType format of the DearJoe Four font in my Win2000
    system using Publisher2000 and get an error message saying the font is not available
    on my system, however, when I selected 'use it anyway' I was able to continue
    and use the font without fault.\r\n\r\nUsing the font in a variety of alternate
    applications I found the font to function as expected, without fault.\r\n\r\n~however~\r\n\r\nTesting
    the font in a WinXP system in Publisher2003 I'm experiencing similar 'not available'
    errors, however, I'm not getting the proper font when selecting 'use it anyway'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
    obviously there's something wrong with the font...\r\nI have genereated the font
    the same way as I always do and this problem has never surfaced. I just can't
    figure out where the problem is. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact
    that the font has A LOT of kerning pairs, but please, if someone would be so kind
    to check this font I'd be happy to send the file to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in
    advance and best regards,\r\nJoe\r\n "
