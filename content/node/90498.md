  2006, the original Font Bros website came to life featuring the one-of-a-kind Selectronic
  font categorization tool to help folks find the fonts they were looking for quickly
  and easily.\r\n\r\nWe were thrilled to usher in each year a cadre of new font releases
  from the talented foundries, font authors and lettering artists whom we consider
  ourselves fortunate to represent at Font Bros. We also enjoyed the emergence of
  these wonderful fonts in popular culture from signs, television programs and commercials
  on down to being the most talked about monogram fonts on the internet.\r\n\r\nInspired
  by the quality of the typefaces we represent at Font Bros, it was at Typecon in
  2009 that we decided they deserved a more loving home and our customers wanted more
  from their experience with our site, we agreed and felt the time was right to set
  our sights on making this our mission.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s taken us over two and a
  half years, lots of critical thinking, loads of conversations and being able to
  let the talented developers at ClearSFG do the things they\u2019re best at to help
  us realize our vision and make it even better than we\u2019d hoped it could be!\r\n\r\nIf
  you're a font author and you'd like to distribute your works with us, please drop
  us a line at support@fontbros.com and we'd love to speak with you further about
  distributing your library! We offer among the best royalty rates in the industry
  of which you keep 65% of every sale and OEM license we arrange plus a bonus 5% on
  every sale you send our way even if its not one of your fonts that is sold.\r\n\r\nTake
  the new site for a spin, kick the tires and let us know what you think as we continue
  to roll out new features and updates throughout the year at: http://www.fontbros.com\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\nMike
  & Stuart\r\nThe Font Bros"

    impossible for me (without creditcard) to use it. Any chance you add support for
    PayPal in the future?"
