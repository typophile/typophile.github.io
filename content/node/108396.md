body: "Hello, I recently purchase the poem script font. It has a LOT of flourishes.
  I am having an issue and was wondering if anyone might have a solution/suggestion?\r\n\r\nWhen
  I print a name and address with that font, some of the flourishes are not printing,
  it is very thin in some parts. I have adjusted the line spacing and now am just
  trying to print one line. I have printed on a color laser and a wide format inkjet
  - both with the same result. I have put the quality at the highest level and have
  even increased the saturation. Nothing helps. \r\n\r\nI am printing from Microsoft
  Word and have also saved it as a PDF and printed from Adobe Acrobat. Acrobat is
  a bit better, but not perfect. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\nJackie\r\n\r\nSample
