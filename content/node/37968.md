  body: too bad it is=)))... here in Moscow we do experience some budget troubles
    with converting typefaces to cyrillic... it would be nice to buy a latin version
    and save some money on "into cyrillic" process... and it's too expensive to build
    a font with no latin digital base... not for this project, pitty. thanks, guys.
