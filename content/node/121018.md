body: "The Vtg Stencil series of fonts from astype are based on real world stencils.
  Vtg Stencil Germany No. 101 is modeled after historic stencil plates from Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThese
  stencils are a unique find. The unevenness of the single plates suggest that they
  were not produced industrially. The design itself, a blackletter chancery, is a
  romantic reprise of a style that was common in German writing offices from the 14th
  to the 16th century. The flourishes stylistically quote the Baroque period. A talented
  mind, perhaps around 1890, has transformed the textura shapes into a modular stencil
  system.\r\n\r\nOverall, this decorative blackletter doesn't look like a stencil
  design. Maybe it was originally used by a sign painter, and all the typical stencil
  bridges would have been painted over in the final work.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking
  for a decorative blackletter font with a unique touch and a romantic feel, you will
  love Germany No.101.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe font is avilable at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astype/vtg-stencil-germany-no101/?refby=as
