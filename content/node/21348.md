    is a pdf of a brief contents of a catalogue somewhere online (I've forgotten where
    at the moment) which is more annoying in its tantalising. I wish I had kept mine.
    Wouldn't recommend buying old sheets though, they had a short enough life when
    they were in general use.\r\nTim"

    father originally bought this 1980 Letraset catalog back when he was attending
    the photo-journalism school at Syracuse University. The sample book had a price
    of $1.00. Dang.\r\n\r\nI've kept the thing ever since he got out of college and
    then collected a number of others. In looking through these books one can easily
    find a lot of really nice display faces of which there is no \"digital\" TTF,
    T1 or OTF version. I'd love to have OTFs of faces like Transmission or Magnificat."
