  body: "The sample is from a science textbook printed in the mid-1970s. The use of
    Courier, to my understanding, was then associated with typewriters almost exclusively.
    Would it have also been used in printed works with any frequency? I might assume
    a more perhaps refined face would have been utilized for printing, a more involved
    process than working on a personal machine and thereby avoiding the typewriter
    associations. The text appears to have the absolute most basic layout possible,
    as if stemming from someone's Masters thesis from the period that was then published.
    What I'd like to know, by examining this sample, can it be said whether this was
    typeset printed material, or does it come directly from a Selectric or similar
    typewriter?\r\n\r\nAppreciatively,\r\nLuca"
