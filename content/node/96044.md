  body: "Solano Gothic\r\n\r\nAbout this font family\r\nMVB Solano Gothic Bold was
    originally designed as a display face for the City of Albany, California (located
    on the San Francisco Bay facing the Golden Gate Bridge and bordering Berkeley).
    Named for the City\u2019s main street, the typeface needed to work on signage
    in proximity to early 20th Century buildings, and in contemporary settings. Rather
    than creating a neutered design to cover all bases, Mark van Bronkhorst chose
    to develop a simple, strong, condensed face that would offer flexibility of style
    by providing both retro and more contemporary forms.\r\n\r\nSolano Gothic has
    since been expanded to a family offering five weights from Light to Bold.\r\nThe
    basic fonts provide upper- and lowercase forms, with figures designed to harmonize
    within upper- and lowercase settings (the standard figures are not full cap height).
    The same figures are provided with Small Caps, and align to small cap height.
    For all-cap settings requiring figures and monetary symbols of full-cap height,
    there are the \u201CCap\u201D fonts. An alternate tabular \u201C1\u201D is provided
    in all fonts so that both fitted and tabular settings of figures are possible
    (access to alternate characters subject to system or application support).\r\n\r\nDesigners:
    Mark van Bronkhorst\r\nDesign date: 2007-2009\r\nPublisher: MVB\r\n\r\n\r\nI know
    of no similar Hebrew font. If you are interested in a custom version, Baruch Gorkin
    at http://baruchgorkin.com/ is very good at creating Hebrew fonts to match English
    fonts. His contact is baruchgorkin@gmail.com.\r\n"
