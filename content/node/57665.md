  body: THANK YOU! The closest I came was Rough Egyptienne but the weight was too
    heavy. How did you know? What do you think of this typeface? I really appreciate
    your response, I searched for hours and it was really bothering me! Gratefully
    Ruby :-)

    Constructa. It's one of those designs you know at first glance didn't come from
    this century. "
