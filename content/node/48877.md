  body: "Go to a library and look at the newest books in a variety of topics and genres.
    Make notes. And photocopies. Jot down questions. Make evaluations: what you like
    and don't like. What seems to work and what not. Your own opinions will be a good
    first guide. Then check out what the \"experts\" say. You may find they agree
    with you at times.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: Thanks! I will look into your links (the links at the Forewords blog look
    promising as well). I've been interested in book design for a long time, but I
    need to find something new and interesting, without knowing where to look.
