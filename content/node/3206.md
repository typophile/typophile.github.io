body: Hi everyone <BR> <BR>This is my first post to typophile. I wanted to introduce
  you to a project I am involved in called IBeam. <BR> <BR>Basically last year we
  started this project as part of Architecture Week here in the uk. We essentially
  worked with some leading architects to see how they think about type and created
  a series of fonts based on their concepts. Here are some images of the typefaces..

  body: I&#39;d love to read the architects explanations behind their designs. Is
    there a link for this? I really like the idea of texture as font &#40;second down&#41;.

  body: oops, just figured out how to upload images. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the website
    is currently down at the moment as they are moving servers, so I have uploaded
    the site to my webspace. <BR><a href="http://www.pixelsumo.com/ibeam/" target="_blank">http://www.pixelsumo.com/ibeam/</a>
    <BR> <BR>There you can download the fonts and look at the photos of the exhibition
    from last year. We have just begun work on this years IBeam, working with dancers
    to concept and create fonts. There will be an exhibition around May in Plymouth
    if anyone is interested. <BR> <BR>Here are a couple of photos from last year...

  body: Hi Chris, <BR> <BR>It seems like an interesting project, but it seems a bit
    removed from typography. Looking at the process the artists are asked to go through,
    they seem to be designing 36 bits of square clip-art, which someone else then
    arranges in visually interesting way. The clip-art may be mapped to a particular
    letter, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a link between a letter and the particular
    image it&#39;s mapped to.  <BR> <BR>You could draw comparisons to the FUSE project,
    but in that project practicing type designers &#40;mostly&#41; were given a theme,
    and they designed a font around that theme. With your project you&#39;ve asked
    people with regular jobs &#40;architect or dancer&#41; to design a font somehow
    related to their job. Your project is interesting; it&#39;s just somewhat less
    typographic than FUSE, which kind of ran it&#39;s course anyway.  <BR> <BR>With
    FUSE most of the fonts had some typographic qualities, an A was supposed to be
    an A &#40;eve when it didn&#39;t look like an A&#41; - this doesn&#39;t seem to
    be the case with your project - you refer to your template as a &#39;landscape&#39;
    not a character map, you only allow one case and no punctuation. The person drawing
    the glyphs has to be reminded not to use color - seems like art is being forced
    into a font file.   <BR> <BR>That&#39;s not a bad thing, but perhaps it explains
    the lack of discussion.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR> <BR>
