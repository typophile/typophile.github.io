  body: "Thanks Nick... I appreciate the insight and look forward to seeing your version.
    \r\nBased on a few places that I've seen this in the past, I assume there must
    be a digital version that already exists - Does anyone know of one?"

  body: Can you give us some insight into where this sample came from? Websites are
    especially helpful given the nature of PDF and Shockwave files.
