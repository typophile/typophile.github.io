    certainly not. \"Not referenced both ways\"... Ludicrous!\r\n\r\nThanks : )"

  body: "Armin, too funny!\r\n\r\nI'm sure my reaction to that character might not
    match everyone else's. But I saw a skit last Saturday, my first experience seeing
    her, and I had the urge to do more than just slap her. Totally annoying. I was
    so annoyed I couldn't laugh until the skit ended. But then, of course, I totally
    laughed and we started thinking of people we know ... I'm rude. I'll stop. "
