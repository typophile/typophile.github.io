  or art with type, but keep the contours and shape of the image... any help? If I
  could be more descriptive, I would, but that's basically it. \r\n\r\nThanks much
  in advance."

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nIf you're using Illustrator you can turn a block of text to outlines
    and use that to make a clipping path over an image. The more text there is and
    in a smaller point size the more image you'll be able to make out. \r\n\r\nIs
    this what you mean?\r\n\r\nAnthony "

  body: "thanks. that's not quite it.\r\nI'm searching for an example of what I mean...
    i see them all the time, but can't seem to dig one up now.\r\n\r\nThe type would
    keep the contour of the image.. getting lighter/darker (smaller/bigger?) to match
    the shades in the image. argh. i'll try and post something if i find it. thanks
    again. \r\n\r\nFabian"

  body: it sounds like you would do this in photoshop,have a posterised or high contrast
    image and then overlay it on the text,you could probably use a combination of
    this and the illustrator technique.

    </strong> is the kind of effect you're trying to achieve?\r\n\r\nIf not this way,
    I guess you should be able to get there playing with a set of Photoshop layers
    (screen, overlay etc.). "

    would use one of those fonts which have the same width for a range of weights
    or styles, it's only that I can't remember a single one now. That way you can
    set the text and choose which letters to emphasize without loosing the alignment
    or the depth.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "It's pretty easy to do, if you're using Adobe Illustrator. \r\nFirst, set
    the text that will serve as the \"background.\" Select, copy and lock the selection.
    Next, Paste In Front, placing the second set of type directly over the first.
    Using the pen tool, draw the area you want to emphasize. Select the pasted in
    front text, and change it's weight to something contrasting (for instance, if
    the locked background text is light, change the second set to bold, or italic,
    or bold italic, etc., so long as it contrasts with the first).\r\nSelect the area
    shape and the second set of text at the same time, go to \"OBJECT\", pull down
    to \"Clipping Mask,\" and choose \"Make.\"\r\nYou will be amazed and delighted.
    Impress your friends."

    somewhere around ascii drawings."
