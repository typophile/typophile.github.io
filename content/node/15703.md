  body: I would guess its because these typefaces are imbeded with online and word
    processing programs. Why would you invest in another font if these fonts can get
    the job done? I think its about economy and need. Is it more important to style
    words or is it more important to convey ideas in an easily recognizable way.

  body: I suppose a single use of a bad typeface would constitute overuse. Billions
    of documents that use a good typeface would likely constitute popularity.

    6 of these faces were designed during the second \r\n  half of the XX century\r\n*
    Only 1 of these faces was originally intended for \r\n  digital setting\r\n* 6
    of these faces were designed by Englsh speakers\r\n* 3 of these faces were designed
    by French speakers\r\n* Only 2 of these faces were designed by German speakers\r\n*
    One of these faces was originally intended for magazine setting\r\n* One of these
    faces was originally intended for newspaper setting\r\n* One of these faces was
    originally intended for display settings\r\n* Three of these faces bear the name

  body: Except for the first on the list -- which is overused probably because of
    its arm in arm relationship with pcs, as DW pointed out, I think it's a list of
    some pretty good faces. That's most likely why they turn up so often.

  body: Remember most Personal Computer users are not designers but are given a bunch
    of fonts and think they are cleaver using different fonts (often badly) but its
    not their fault. If it comes with an application they will probably use them.
    The concept of purchasing licences for fonts is never explained, not when they
    buy the computer or the software. Bank Gothic isn't the culprit, its the people
    who decided to include it with the computer/software.
