  Things We See.</em> The jacket notes: \r\n</dt><dd>The aim of the authors in this
  series is to encourage us to look at the objects of everyday life with fresh and
  critical eyes. Thus while increasing our own daily pleasure we also become better
  able to create suroundings which will give us permanent pleasure. To achieve this
  in the furnishing and the equipment of our homes, we must buy with discrimination
  and so prove to designers, who set the machines to work, that we are no longer bound
  by habit or indifference to accept whatever is offered.</dd></dl> \r\n<dl>Books
  in the series covered Houses, Furniture, Pottery and Glass, Public Transport, and
  Ships. They were exquisitely designed, set, produced and printed, with rotogravure
  plates. My favourite is <em>Ships</em>, by David Pye. His philosophy of design is
  well put, and bears applying to type, so I will quote him at length:</dt> <dd>\r\n
  \  Just as a style can become too much for the designer, so also can functional
  requirements. Indeed it is perfectly possible for requirements to be so intractable
  that a designer has the utmost difficulty in finding any satisfactory compromise
  which will meet them. Too little freedom of choice can be as fatal to good design
  as too much--more fatal in fact, because designers of outstanding ability can put
  up with a great deal of freedom, but even they are helpless with none at all. It
  may be no fault of the designer's that a ship looks badly designed: it is his misfortune
  always to be judged by results: the public at large are not to know that he may
  have been asked to put a quart into a pint pot--nor that he may have almost succeeded!\r\n
  \  There are probably some types of ship which are incapable of being made to take
  the eye, and anyone criticising a ship's design or her designer should remember
  this. Only an expert will be able to judge whether the designer's problem could
  be solved; and if so, whether he has solved it well.\r\n   To appreciate the beauty
  of good design, on the other hand, requires no expert knowledge; but it is one thing
  to appreciate it and quite another to explain what it is, how it is recognised and
  understood. The designer himself cannot explain the quality of his design. He arrives
  at a good design by choosing one set of shapes in preference to another, but he
  may be too much preoccupied with meeting requirements to be conscious that he is
  doing so; and even if he is conscious of choosing, he will not be able to give any
  real explanation of the mental process that decides his choice; for just as the
  mental process of logical reasoning can find expression in words but not in the
  notes of music, so can the mental process of designing find expression only in shapes
  but not in words. It is impossible to give a reasoned explanation of the beauty
  of design, simply because it is not the product of logical reasoning but of a different
  kind of thought. Looking at good design will help to understand it more than reasoning
  about it--or than reading about it. The illustrations will speak for themselves
  better than I can speak for them.\r\n   There are qualities of good design which
  can be described; but it is not possible to point to a beautiful ship and a commonplace
  one and to say, \"this one is beautiful<em> because</em> she has a pronounced sheer,
  which the other has not; or because she has a rounded front to the bridge, or a
  raking stem, or a flaring bow.\" A ship may have all these things and be ugly, or
  none of them and still be beautiful.</dd> </dl>\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ships2_5328.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SHIPS_page_5236.jpg]\r\n(Nice

  body: Thanks for posting this Nick. I for one wish, no hope and prey that craftsmanship
    can once again be elevated to where it once was. We have many fine craftsmen and
    women in modern type design and typography, but alas their number are few compared
    to the masses.

  body: "The irony is that the first paragraph refutes the second. \r\n\r\nNobody
    can fully capture a piece of art or craft by words alone, of course. But that
    is really a straw man. For words can often shed light both on the finished product
    and the process that produced it; and that is all writing about art tries to do.
    Indeed the first paragraph does give interesting insight into the process of a
    ship designer.  \r\n\r\nIn fact creativity in art, and science and craft share
    that they are constrained problem-solving processes, and so have a lot in common
    even though they are in different fields. \r\n\r\nAnd writing about literature,
    music, or visual is often delightful.  Some of us even greatly enjoy reading about
    type--including when Nick Shinn writes about it on Typophile, which fortunately
    is pretty often :) "

    again be elevated to where it once was.</em>\r\n\r\n\"prey\" > pray.\r\n\r\nCareful
    what you pray for. You're the first to mention \"craftsmanship\". Isn't this thread
    about design?\r\n\r\nDid you have a specific time or place in mind for \"where
    it once was\" ? It sounds a lot like classical ancient Greeks looking back with
    starry eyes to their \"golden age\" and the \"silver age\" that came after it,
    then the great fall from grace into the Greek dark age before their reinventing
    themeselves in classical form.\r\n\r\nIn other words the Golden Olden Days syndrome
    in which design (or craft) was always better in the recent past than it is today.
    In some instances this way of viewing history is proven valid, and in ass many
    other instances it turns out to be a load of wishful romanticism and nothing more.\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious about what you mean by \"where it once was\", since that implies a certain
    time & place.\r\n\r\n<em>We have many fine craftsmen and women in modern type
    design and typography, but alas their number are few compared to the masses.</em>\r\n\r\nSounds
    like a sweeping and generalized view based on a personal impression of the world.
    Do you have any figures or statistical studies to back it up? Or can you be more
    sepcific? Are you referring to professional graphic / visual designers versus
    non-designers (untrained) and other folks who aren't designers by instinct or
    trade but have the means to design using a computer and software?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    \"modern\" is a very loosely employed word that can refer to people, places and
    things ranging in date from the present back to the Italian renaissance of the
    15th century. I think the word(s) you really want there are \"contemporary\" or
    \"present day\".\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    it indeed should have been "pray".

  body: James. Implicit in my 'generalized' remarks following Nick's very fine post
    is the characteristic 'vagueness' that one may find in cooking recipes for example.
    The vagueness is not confusion or ambiguity but a recognition that the actual
    fitting together of the components is up to the individual's perception and experience.
