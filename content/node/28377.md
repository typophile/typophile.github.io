  last time the forum was down!\r\n\r\nDid anyone get Veer's mail campaign for The
  New Old book? I think it came like a month ago or few weeks ago. Very snazzy. Love
  the type, the cover stock, the stock inside (Are the pages scented?) The embossing
  on the covers... kudos to veer."

    pages, but the type is Mark Simonson's <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=mostra\">Mostra</a>
    and Nick Cooke's <a href='http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=nubian\">Nubian</a>.
    There\u2019s an associated slideshow and a PDF version of the book available for
    those not fortunate enough to receive a (scented) hard copy.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/ideas/newold/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/download/pdf/veer200608_newold.pdf\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/catalog_4243.2006.08.02.newold.jpg]"

    Houschka Alternate and fondled that touchy-feely cover for quite a while.\r\n\r\nNick

    be the first example I''ve seen using embossing on one of my fonts.'

    thank you very much. I'll pass along the kudos to the creative team that put the
    book together. I have to say that of all the pieces we've put out over the past
    couple of years, this one is garnering a lot of attention."

    all I need to complete the right typographic impression is that tasty Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
    T shirt featuring 3 of my E's on the top row I believe.\r\n\r\nI know you don't
    send these outside North America, but could you make an exception?\r\n\r\nI'll
    pay of course!\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
