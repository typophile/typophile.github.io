body: "I am looking to see if there is a script that would automate the production
  of font files from a fontlab multiple master font. This script, if it exists, would
  allow input of the weights/widths, whatever axis  and match it up with the all correct
  naming for the font. (900 wt, 750 wd)= XYZ Black Extended, with all the different
  fields, filename, etc. This would allow the generation of however many individual
  .vfbs needed. Superpolater doesnt appear to do this...I understand FL6 is supposed
  to have better naming. This seems pretty easy to script. I am confident I could
  do it with a macro, but I dont know python well at all. Does this already exist?

    is a script that generates instances from an MM font but I don't remember how
    it handles the naming. "
