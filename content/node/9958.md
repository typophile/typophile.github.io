  body: It smells like T-26, but can&#39;t find anything that would have exactly the
    same features.

  body: I know for a fact that it&#39;s a custom-made font by the book designers,
    a student from Lausanne/Switzerland. Check the book&#39;s colophon. It&#39;s mentioned
    there. Or write to Phaidon, they&#39;ll put you in touch.

  body: It looks a lot like the type produced by the autolettering machines for draughtsmen.
    You could try and look for it on CAD-sites &#40;that&#39;s Computer Aided Design&#41;.

  body: Hello, <BR>The font was custom-designed for the Bouroullec project by Julien
    Gaillardot, a former student from the University of Art &amp; Design Lausanne.
    Now he has his own graphic &amp; type design studio in Avignon, France. The design
    is based on Bouroullec design shapes and exists in 2 weights. Julien will release
    a new typeface family on Optimo this spring.
