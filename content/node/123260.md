  body: "It looks like the latin-subset of the Korean font <strong>YD Hope (Bold)</strong>
    by YoonDesign [1989-2012]:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/yoon-design/yd-hope/bold\r\n\r\nThe
    <strong>Haan Somang</strong> font (also from YoonDesign) seems to have the same
    latin-subset but I can't find a source for it."
