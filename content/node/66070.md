  serif elements to this font; the angles and counter forms are closer to serif type,
  even though this is very much a sans serid font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tip_4636.png]\r\n\r\nHere's

  body: "This has a lot of potential, Tomi! Make sure you keep those counters as open
    as possible in the heavier weights to avoid some pitfalls from your earlier families.\r\n\r\n-
    Some glyphs are missing the stroke modulation that's more obvious in those with
    curves. This seems fixable on the 's', but I don't know what to tell you on the
    'k','v','w','x'. Maybe some very subtle, straight lined tapering? See Amira!\r\n\r\n-
    I like it's liveliness, but I think the 'g' is leaning a little too far to the
    left. Maybe move that bottom bowl a bit.\r\n\r\n- The italic needs a lot of work.
    I think there is too much evidence of automatic slanting, but someone with more
    experience can explain why."

  body: "Thanks, Stephen-\r\n\r\nI think that the spur of the 'a' is too heavy, and
    your Amira is a good way to go. But this is just a start. And yes, italics are
    just mess."

  body: "I quite like this Tomi, but like Stephen suggests the g needs an overhaul!\r\n\r\nWhat's
    the secret? You seem to be very prolific at the moment! Perhaps you can make some
    kind of workflow thread?\r\n\r\nBest"

  body: The 'g' had an overhaul. Thanks for that. And I hope I can tame them all.
    I've grown used to have a lot of projects at the same time; it tends to help with
    the more tedious aspects of type design to have more than one design to work with.
