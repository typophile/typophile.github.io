  body: Looks super. I'd say the aperture of "o" is pinched too narrow for print or
    pixels. You might consider just closing it.

  body: Lovely. Perhaps the peak of /P/ could use some more weight, and maybe the
    strokes of /ui/ are a bit too mechanically similar. I agree with cerulean about
    the /o/.

  body: The O also doesn't seem to sit at the same angle as the rest of the letters,
    but besides that it looks great!

  body: Agree with the above, even though the angle of the /a/ and /q/ seems to differ
    from the angle of the /o/ it doesn't bother me really. Overall the wordmark looks
    balanced and stylish - definitely has a 'brush' feel to it. Have you tried a /P/
    with a higher stem as well (higher topleft)? Also, it would be interesting maybe
    to see it with a brush-stroke below the word - although you'd be at risk crossing
    the /q/ there.
