  the images i'm placing are at 150DPI 21x29.7 in size (jpeg), now when i place them
  in the image rectangle they turn out very small. Does anybody know why indesign
  does this and how to avoid this, i would like to have the correct image size when
  placing my images in indesign.\r\n\r\ndoes scaling up by dragging them in indesign
  result into pixeled images knowing they are 150DPI (can't check cause i have no
  printer atm)\r\n\r\nthnx in advance"

    like 300 dpi or higher. 300 dpi would cause a 150 dpi image to import at half

    that, the image appears really small\r\n\r\ni opened up a pic in photoshop and
    its a 18.5 x 15 cm pic at 250pix/inch\r\n\r\nwhen placing in indesign on a 21
    x 29.7cm document all i get is this really small image\r\n\r\n"

    the image is selected, you can look at the info bar if the image is placed at
    100% or not. If it is placed at 100% or smaller, it will print fine. If it's placed
    smaller than 100%, enlarge it until it's back at 100% (well... if that is the
    size you want it to be...)\r\n\r\nPixels will only appear if you place it larger
    than 100%, especially at 150dpi, which is rater lowres. :)\r\n"

  body: "Resolution is not set in InDesign. InDesign always places images at 100%
    of size except when you are re-linking an old image with a new one.\r\n\r\nNominal
    resolution will change for imaging purposes if you scale a raster image up or
    down when placed in InDesign.\r\n\r\nI tried to duplicate your problem but could
    not. I have seen a similar problem in old versions of Quark but don't remember
    what caused them and even then, though the image showed to be very small when
    placed, it still printed at the correct size and resolution. I have been using
    InDesign since v2.0 and have never encountered what you describe.\r\n\r\n<cite>
    >> does scaling up by dragging them in indesign result into pixeled images knowing
    they are 150DPI (can\u2019t check cause i have no printer atm) << </cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    the small image you are seeing is 100% then you cannot scale it up without losing
    all hope of quality. Try scaling it by two or three hundred percent then view
    it in InDesign's hi-res mode; that should tell you what you need to know.\r\n\r\nSorry
    I don't have a definite solution for you.\r\n\r\n"

    like i was, I just zoomed in on my image, print screened it and copied it into
    indesign and it stopped being incredibly small"

  body: "Ah. Four years old. There goes my first thought, which was if your images
    really were 20 x 29.7 <strong>inches</strong> that may be the problem. But probably
    not, I've placed images bigger than the document size before, and they behaved
    normally. Never tried poster-size images though...\r\n\r\nAs a note, if you're
    going to reduce the size of an image, best to do it in Photoshop, or some software
    that doesn't simply scale. That way you can retain/improve resolution."
