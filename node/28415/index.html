  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In September 2006, the new FontBook 2006 edited by Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert and others was published replacing the old FontBook 1998. After comparing FontBook 2006 with FontBook 1998, I doubt whether the new FontBook 2006 is a non-partisan, objective reference work. It seems to me that the new FontBook 2006 is a non-impartial sales catalog selecting fonts by party-political criteria.

Let's start by having a look at the list of font manufacturers. In the old FontBook 1998, the list of manufacturers (see page 17) started with

- Adobe
- Berthold

whereas in new FontBook 2006, the list of font manufacturers (see page 54) does no longer contain Adobe and Berthold. This means that the editors Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert make the FontBook users believe that e.g. Adobe does not longer exist as a font manufacturer.

The newer Adobe fonts Warnock (2000), Bickham Script (2000), Chaparral (2000), Montara (2001), Brioso (2002), Kepler (2003) and Garamond Premier Pro (2005) etc. have been excluded entirely from the FontBook 2006, whereas some older Adobe fonts, e.g. Minion, Myriad, Utopia, Tekton, are still included in the new FontBook 2006, but are now described as fonts made by Monotype as font manufacturer and not as fonts made by Adobe as font manufacturer, because Adobe was deleted by the editors Eric Spiekermann et al. from the list of font manufacturers and replaced by Monotype.

In the old FontBook 1998, on looking up Minion, Myriad, Utopia, Tekton etc., you will see in the yellow bar by the letter "A" (= manufacturer Adobe) that these fonts are manufactured by Adobe. In the new FontBook 2006, on looking up Minion, Myriad, Utopia, Tekton etc., you will see that the letter "A" for Adobe in the yellow bar was deleted, and on consulting the new "Contents" section at the beginning of the book, you will see that these Adobe fonts are now labeled "C" denoting "Monotype Imaging", e.g.

Minion = C = Monotype (see page 31 of FontBook 2006),
Utopia = C = Monotype (see page 49),
Tekton = C = Monotype (see page 46).

A few Adobe fonts are also ascribed to Linotype, e.g. Myriad = LH = Linotype (see page 32), but none of the Adobe fonts is ascribed to Adobe by the editors Eric Spiekermann et al.

A final example: The old FontBook 1998 contained both Cronos by Adobe and Today by Scangraphic. Now in the new FontBook 2006, Eric Spiekermann et al. removed Adobe's Cronos, but kept Today of the defunct Scangraphic outfit.

Although nobody can call me a friend of Adobe's (see my critical documentations about Adobe at http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#ADOBE9), I consider it necessary to say in favour of Adobe that it is non-objective and even ridiculous by Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert, who edited the FontBook 2006, that they removed Adobe as a font manufacturer, and I also think that it is non-scholarly and non-impartial that Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert excluded most of the newer fonts manufactured by Adobe, e.g. Brioso, Chaparral, Garamond Premier Pro, Kepler, Warnock, etc., which are important enough for the history of typefaces to justify their inclusion into a FontBook containing 35,000 fonts.

Whereas the old FontBook 1998 contained all Berthold fonts, the new FontBook 2006 contains none of them at all. Here again, from the scholarly point of view, a non-partisan reference work would include these fonts, although it is understandable that Eric Spiekermann, who once was an employee of the defunct Berlin stock-holding company H. Berthold AG, is not longer willing to include the Berthold fonts into the new FontBook on account of the fact that he was harassed and sued by well-known Chicago conmen (who no longer live in Chicago).

For typeface researchers, the FontBook 2006 is not only made incomplete by the exclusion of the historically important Berthold collection, but there now also arise other problems for researchers. For example, in the old FontBook 1998, the font FF Dax was provided with the reference to the font Barmen, while in the new FontBook 2006, this reference was dropped with the consequence that readers are intentionally withheld the information that FF Dax distributed by FontShop is a reworking of the old Berthold font Barmen made by the same designer (see http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#BARMEN).

While the new FontBook 2006 annoys by the exclusion of Adobe, Berthold and other large font manufacturers, this new FontBook surprises by the inclusion of small font forgering outfits that had been excluded from the old FontBook 1998. An example is the Brendel font forging company. In 1997, FontShop initiated a multi-year lawsuit against the Brendel font forging outfit in Cologne (Germany) with the favorable result for FontShop that the Brendel outfit went broke. However the defunct Brendel outfit was founded again as the Quick Brown Fox outfit in Cologne (see http://www.qbf.de) selling again the Brendel forgeries which are also sold by Greenstreet, Softmaker and other font forging outfits (see http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#GREEN).

Much to my surprise, these Brendel font forgeries (e.g. Diamante, Dragon, Lingwood, Nashville, Pasadena, etc.) which are sold by QBF, Greenstreet and Softmaker at 0.01 Euro per font and which had been excluded from the old FontBook 1998 for the reasons stated above, have now been included into the FontBook 2006, because the Elsner + Flake outfit in Hamburg recently grabbed these Brendel font forgeries (presumably by exploiting the Greenstreet font forgery CD) and is now selling these font forgeries at 35.00 Euro per font through FontShop. This explains why Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert decided to include these Brendel font forgeries into the new FontBook 2006.

Under these circumstances, it cannot be denied that the new Fontbook 2006 is a non-impartial sales catalog and not an objective reference work. Here a final example: In the old FontBook 1998, in section Slab Serif, page 9, two Candida typeface versions are shown, the first one labeled "A" = Adobe, and the second one labeled "B" = Berthold. In the new FontBook 2006, on account of the fact that Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert no longer like Adobe and Berthold, two other Candida typeface versions are shown in the section Slab, page 11. The first one is the version by Neufville, and the second one is the version by Elsner + Flake which is selling the Brendel font forgeries through FontShop.

It would be impossible to include them all.
So is still be a good addition to any font library, despite the omissions.
Other hardback specimens of the digital era: Font Bureau and Indie Fonts (1, 2, and soon 3), and...? 
The Garamond Premier specimen was the best thing in the TypeCon goody bag. But then, I have a softness for Strathmore, such beautiful colours.
House Industries does nice specimens, but they are not proper specimens, as no alphabet showings.
Emigre and H&FJ have beautiful specimens, but they are not AFAIK available in hard cover.</div>

I intentionally wrote "Eric" instead of "Erik" to keep the Typophile readers happy and alert knowing that you as a hair-splitter would fall for that trap.

> 2. I have never been an employee of Berthold or any of its affiliates. I have no idea where you get that information from.

In your own biography at the FontShop website, you write yourself: "arbeitete vornehmlich für die graphische Branche - darunter Berthold", i.e. "worked for Berthold". So you yourself confessed that you worked for Berthold, didn't you?

> 3. That book is called a “compendium” of digital fonts. Look up what that word means.

In your own preface to the FontBook 2006, you declare that this compendium "is a truly unique type encyclopedia" (see page 6). So you yourself explained what the word "compendium" means for you, didn't you?

> Shoddy work like this disqualifies anybody from commenting on other peoples’ work.

Do you mean by "shoody work" your own FontBook 2006?

> And as has been said by others, there are many reasons why not every typeface under the sun is in the FontBook. It always takes two sides to make a bargain.

I did not say that a one-volume book can contain "every typeface under the sun".

The crucial point is that you write in your own preface: "The editors emphasise their desire to present a work of reference rather than a sales catalogue" (see page 7). But your FontBook 2006 is not a work of reference, it is a sales catalogue:

- In a "work of reference", in a "truly unique type encyclopedia", a font manufacturer (e.g. Adobe) and his fonts (e.g. Adobe Garamond Premier Pro) are included by objective criteria.

- In a "sales catalogue", a font manufacturer and his fonts are included, if you can "make a bargain" (your own words) with the font manufacturer.

Since the font manufacturer Adobe did not "make a bargain" with you, this font manufacturer was excluded from the FontBook, and since you could "make a bargain" concerning the Brendel font forgeries , they were included by you. "Bargain" may be okay for a "sales catalogue", but "bargain" is definitely not okay for "a work of reference", for "a truly unique type encyclopedia".

I work for clients, that’s how i make a living. That doesn’t mean they employ me. I designed literature, advertising, exhibitions and specimens for Berthold from the early 80s until their demise and they paid my fees for that work. You should perhaps sometimes think about what you read and not simply repeat the words like a parrot. 

And only one word about the book: we can only print fonts that we have, as we do not steal data, nor scan specimens in from other books. If suppliers won’t let FSI have that data – for whatever reason – we cannot show it. Blame the foundries, not the publishers. With 35,000 showings, FontBook is still a compendium. It doesn’t claim anywhere to be exhaustive, complete or the only reference book. We measure ourselves by our deeds, not by someone else’s words.

Don’t you have a day job or do you spend all your time complaining about other people?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course, a book like the fontbook just can't be complete, for various reasons, and stands a good chance to be outdated or even more inclomplete the day it leaves the press. nonetheless, i truly respect people who undertake such a challenge and the effort they put into it, esp. as they must be aware of the factors mentioned above.
And let's not forget, FSI is a company dealing with fonts, not an independent book publisher, and of course they won't include fonts they don't carry. Of course it is sad not to have fonts of Berthold, TEFF, DTL, etc. included, but if you have a bit of experience in the business, you know they are out there and where to get these if you want or must.
It is great to have a book like FB around, esp. in times where dozens of new fonts seem to be released every day.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">" I doubt whether the new FontBook 2006 is a non-partisan, objective reference work"
An interesting point of view. Now, to get the thing before all the publicity makes it a seller's market again. . . ;)

Most font books are non-fiction, reference, catalog, print samples, at least. They are also collectables, status symbols, beautiful objects, tools of a trade, and many more things. The publishers, for the most part, gather what they Know they are going to have for sale, organize it for easy finding, price items for easy buying and try to print, price and publish the book in a mutually cost beneficial form for easy access, (non-fiction, reference, catalog, print sample). 

As such, I doubt that the energy, time or planning for non-partisanship could have that much of an effect at the editorial level, the decisions having been made in font licensing. Besides, if you miss Adobe's or Berthold's or Font Bureau's whole library, well get their books, specimens, urls, and make a bigger boooook :) </div>

I say that you deleted Berthold and ascribed Adobe fonts to Monotype, and you start a distracting discussion about the distinction between "to work for" and "to be employed by".

The "Contents" section (pages 1-53) abounds in false ascriptions of fonts, such as the false ascription of all Adobe fonts to Monotype. It seems that these false ascriptions were part of the "bargain".</div>

This illustrates beautifully how Uli works. It's not the first time he's used such techniques on Typophile. There may be a few legitimate questions in his diatribe but I haven't answered them here because I don't respond to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">forum trolls</a> as a personal policy. 

<dl><dt></dt><dd>For many people, the characterising feature of trolling is the perception of intent to disrupt a community in some way. Inflammatory, sarcastic, disruptive or humorous content is posted, meant to draw other users into engaging the troll in a fruitless confrontation. The greater the reaction from the community the more likely the user is to troll again, as the person develops beliefs that certain actions achieve his/her goal to cause chaos. This gives rise to the often repeated protocol in Internet culture: <strong>"Do not feed the trolls."</strong></dd></dl>

I will answer, to the best I am able, FontBook questions asked by others, in any other threads -- or at least direct the question to those that know more than I. As for this thread, I'd consider it fruitless, or at least dead and rotten.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant — I do not care about the person behind these questions, neither about his supposed inner conflicts, nor his methods. I care about his questions only, in as far as they might disclose information that I consider useful for my business. If you tell me he's a "witch-hunter", that does not concern me. You may consider "witch-hunters" or "trolls" as your "enemies", not worthy of a decent answer, but you should not impose these personal moral judgements of yours onto the public's interest, by denying others a rightful answer. Morality simply isn't relevant for the plain factual matter that is at stake here.

I recur that I am interested in the business tactics of the font industry, because as a font user and buyer I am directly involved. As a client of this industry, by paying for licenses that claim to give me a lawful user's right, I earned the right of verifying whether the goods and/or services I paid for, conform to what they are sold as, and/or to hear others that verified this for me.

The way in which similar cases were handled before within our business, is painful and unbecoming. If there is something like a "Berthold Gate" in the font industry, this should be dealt with appropriately, that means publicly, by reasoning and proof, not by irrelevant emotional outbursts, and certainly not by populist summary justice and peer pressure.

		<div class="commentbody">A  few <em>short, rightful answers</em>:
1. Adobe fonts are distributed by many companies, e.g. Monotype, Linotype, Agfa. Data is always identical. Like you can buy a Mercedes from the plant in Stuttgart, from your local dealer, a dealer in another city. It's always a Mercedes and it'll look just the same on a picture. Nothing false about distributing identical fonts from different sources.

2. It makes a hell of a difference to me whether i had been employed by a company or worked for them in a designer-client relationship. If someone who pretends to be diligent and detail-oriented alters my biography with one keystroke, i feel obliged to correct it. That has nothing to do with other issues.

3. There are many mistakes in the FontBook, which is inevitable with that amount of data. Some of them are human errors: we didn’t catch them or we left something out inadvertently. Some have to do with false data, late data or no data. There will be Errata pages as our readers help us collate omissions and other mistakes. Go to www.fontbook.com, where our corrections will be posted; some as pdf for download.

4. As has already been pointed out: the FontBook was out of date the minute we closed the database. And that was months before it was printed. We rely on foundries, friends and collaborators to supply new materials while we think about the next edition. Right now, we're all tired and proud that we managed to collate, edit, and print 1760 pages. 

5. The only way to avoid making mistakes is not to make anything. Which obviously is what some people are very good at.

The fact that type experts like you are not even mentioning the subject is building the gate. Younger designers like myself have run into a lot of nasty stumbling blocks when trying to research Berthold; in no small part due to the vile treatment of experts–not to mention fonts–by the Hunts. I'm spending a good chunk of this week trying to read books in a language I don't know, in the Library of Congress, just to get through the obfuscation–it's the sort of thing that will just drive me to work with the knockoffs, or my pirate stuff, instead.</div>

I am under a court order restraining me from discussing the matter. But there have been threads on Typophile, and there is background material on other sites, notably on the one run by the person who started this one. I’m sure other people can point you there. I know that there is a search robot out there with my name on it as well as that of all the names registered by an impostor who falsely claims to be the successor to a certain foundry. As soon as I but mention any real names, I get a letter from a lawyer, Life’s too short for this type of crap.

I do not see, however, how buying from private sites could possibly help you clear things up. If anything, this issue is about legal threats and verbal violence, which are methods not normally associated with the business of making good type. Don’t help these people by giving up so quickly.</div>

In the end, it's all about the goodwill, the moral consciousness of the designer (and/or the company) to decide what to market and sell. The moral would also answer the question of what makes a revival a 'revival', and an original an 'original'.

> 1. Adobe fonts are distributed by many companies, e.g. Monotype, Linotype, Agfa. Data is always identical. Like you can buy a Mercedes from the plant in Stuttgart, from your local dealer, a dealer in another city.

I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding here. The header on page 54 of FontBook 2006 is

"Manufacturers (Hersteller)",

and this page 54 lists these "manufacturers" with respective abbreviations, e.g.

"FB = Font Bureau".

Now let's assume, a FontBook user interested in the font "Agency" by David Berlow on page 5 of the "Sans" section wants to know the "manufacturer" (= foundry) of this font. For this purpose, the user looks up the font "Agency" in the "Contents" section, where he - in this case, luckily - finds the equation

"Agency = FB".

because here the "manufacturer" of the font is correctly given. But this is often not the case, as has been exemplified in my first posting to this thread, so that the reader may read the equation

"Agency = M".

This is bewildering, because "M = Monotype" is not the "manufacturer" of the font Agency, but only one of many dealers, sellers or distributors of this font Agency, or - worst case - a foundry which is neither the manufacturer nor the distributor of the font Agency.

Exactly this happens in the "Contents" section with the Adobe fonts and also with many fonts by numerous other foundries, i.e. the "Contents" section often does not state the true "manufacturer", but instead a distributor or another company, which is not the true "manufacturer" (= true foundry).
 
The confusion of the FontBook readers could be remedied by renaming the header on page 54 from "Manufacturer" to "Dealer", but many users want to know the "manufacturer". And the true "manufacturer", e.g. Font Bureau, certainly also prefers to see the true manufacturer equation "Agency = FB" instead of the wrong manufacturer equation "Agency = M".</div>

You are discussing errors in the FontBook. This kind of thing is normal in publishing and it is expected that users will assist the publisher in correcting errors for future versions (as Erik has stated above). Can you simply note mistakes without concocting a conspiracy? 

In the final analysis, nobody but you expects FontBook to be an objective reference work. It doesn't change the fact that it is a monumental work of information design and that very few foundries, much less independent parties, have undertaken to present so much information in such a compact and intelligent format. 

Again I suggest: Since you seem deeply concerned with authenticity, objectivity, factual accuracy and full disclosure, why don't you produce your own objective, complete reference to all available digital fonts? The answer to this question is vital....</div>

You can get the book from San Francisco. I think you pay a few dollars more to cover the fact that they were quick-shipped from Germany.

The FontBook team have probably received their "Adobe" fonts from Monotype - that's why they are marked as "Monotype" fonts. Monotype is the FontBook source of these "standard" fonts. They could have been supplied by Adobe, they could have been supplied by Linotype...

Note that most of the fonts available through Adobe are originally made by Monotype, Linotype and ITC, usually crosslicenced - for distribution purposes - between them.

So e.g. Frutiger - originally from Linotype - is often referred to as an "Adobe" font - even when it is distributed through Monotype.
Not too difficult, is it?
;-)

Hrant:

A non-disclosure agreement has nothing to do
with the country, where disclosure takes place.
So neither Cuba nor any similar country will do.

No, it's not. Just compare the different manufacturer's versions of say Garamond, Futura, Walbaum or any other classic face and you'll see why.</div>

It's this way: In Germany (and in other European countries as well), companies have to show to the end user of a product the total price he has to pay for it, including VAT. Companies don't have to pay VAT, so they are interested in the price without VAT, because that's the one they have to pay.
Fontshop wants to show just one price on their website, not two. And as most customers of Fontshop are companies, they choose to show the price without VAT. This means that they are not allowed to sell their products to private persons, because they don't show them the price they have to pay.
