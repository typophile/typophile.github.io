body: "This fine sign has been up for at least 50 years. The former clothes shop in
  Yorkshire hasn't been open for some 25 years, but the sign is still there for some
  reason. I believe I photographed it in the nick of time, as the space behind the
  facade is empty now.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clutterbuck_4549.jpg]"
