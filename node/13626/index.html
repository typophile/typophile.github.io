(For anyone too young to remember, U&amp;lc, Upper &amp; lower case, was this brilliant oversized typography and design magazine that was around from the 70’s until 1999.)   In any case, it was a “must read” for graphic designers and I’m baffled that I hadn’t heard of this book before.  You can order it straight from the publisher http://www.markbattypublisher.com who has lots of other interesting graphic-design books. (Check out the book about [[graffiti]] in the Paris Underground, it’s fascinating.)   </code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the book is 9 1/4 x 12 7/8 inches (with some fold outs).
It would have been great to see complete pages reproduced in the original large format newsprint size.</p>
<p>But any version is great for younger designers to review.
I, luckily enough, was on the U&amp;lc mailing list from the debut issue Vol. I No. 1 and for years stalked the mailman for my issues.</p>
<p>BTW, if you didn&rsquo;t know, [[Mark Batty]] was president and CEO of ITC after [[Aaron Burns]].</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the longest sentence spread:</p>
<p>Actually, this was a spread displaying two consecutive sentences from James Joyce&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Both sentences have more words than Victor Hugo&rsquo;s famous sentence from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Les Misarables<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Each page was composed in six &ldquo;newspaper style&rdquo; columns set in what looks like ITC Garamond Book. The first sentence opens with the word &ldquo;YES&rdquo; in large caps, and the last sentenced ends with &ldquo;YES&rdquo; in large caps.</p>
<p>On the longest words.
This was a theme used from time to time as part of Herb&rsquo;s fascination with long words.</p>
<p>On the longest town name.
In one of these articles they dispayed the name of a village in New Zealand containing 70 consecutive characters:</p>
<p>Raumatawhakatangakoauauatamateapokaiwhenuakitanantahuwhakatamahangakoa</p>
<p>which translates: &ldquo;Hill crest where the traveller Tamatea piped on his nose flute for his beloved one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I retreived all the above info from U&amp;lc page reproductions in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Herb Lubalin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Gertrude Snyder &amp; Alan Peckolick.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have the patience to dig through my archieves for the original U&amp;lc issues, which are hermetically sealed behind a brick wall in my wine cellar (not!).</p>
<p>All of this reminiscing must seem boring to young readers, especially since we&rsquo;re not showing images. I guess it&rsquo;s sort of like old coots talking about a baseball game from the 1940s.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newly released book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (edited by [[John D Berry|John D. Berry]]), but I&rsquo;m sure there is a lot of background details and stories behind the graphic phenomenon of U&amp;lc.</p>
<p>Most of the early editions were representative of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[[New York School]]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> style of design, made popular by [[Herb Lubalin|Lubalin]], [[Seymore Chwast|Chwast]], [[Milton Glaser|Glaser]] ([[Pushpin Studios]]) to name only a few of the giants involved. Also, it became a gallery of the superb work of [[Tom Carnase]], [[Tony Di Spigna]], [[Ed Benguiat]], again, only naming a few.</p>
<p>But the most brilliant aspect of the publication is that it became a &ldquo;mother&rdquo; of a marketing tool for the infant [[ITC|International Typeface Corporation]]. This came about through the passionate leadership of Aaron Burns.</p>
<p>ITC used U&amp;lc to sell the idea of &ldquo;Licensing&rdquo; typeface designs. In other words, it made it a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->moral<!-- raw HTML omitted --> issue not to use ITC typefaces unless they had the official &ldquo;seal of approval&rdquo;. A list of the ITC licensed foundries was published towards the back of each issue.</p>
<p>As the popularity of ITC typefaces grew, this added a little pressure for more and more foundries and manufacturers of typesetting equipment to sign on with ITC.</p>
<p>What made this so unique, is that ITC through U&amp;lc had found a way of popularizing their designs even BEFORE they were released and available for typesetting.</p>
<p>You can imagine how many young designers who read U&amp;lc looked for the very first opportunity to emmulate their heros by specifying ITC typefaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jeff,</p>
<p>did you see your first U&amp;lc issue in school, or did you get it in the mail?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how extensive the first few mailings were. I know that I used to buy typesetting from [[Photo-Lettering, Inc.]], in NYC, so that&rsquo;s how I got on the mailing list.</p>
<p>[[Milton Kaye]], founder and publisher of [[GraphicDesignUSA]], told me he gave [[Aaron Burns]] his mailing list of subscribers. Obviously Aaron sent them to schools and colleges around the country as well.</p>
<p>If you or anyone can add any info I&rsquo;d appreciate it as I would like to find out how Aaron built the mailing list for the first year of U&amp;lc. I guess one person to ask is [[Ed Rondthaler]], who was one of the three founders of ITC. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, I believe Mr. Rondthaler recently celebrated his 100th birthday.</p>
<p>He and [[Ed Benguiat]] will be speakers at TypeCon2005 on Friday, July 22nd if someone in attendance is willing to ask him.</p>

I also got promos from U&amp;lc and ended up buying a mammoth type specimen book in 1980 which doesn&rsquo;t fit on any bookshelf I own. The book is hard-bound and about 13&quot; square and about 2&quot; thick.  The cover and titles are set in ITC Benguiat.  I would bring it to TypeCon for Ed to sign but I would get a hernia carrying it :-)</p>

This issue also has clay sculpture portraits of numerous type biggies of the day.  The paper is yellowing badly.  Darn nice printing for newsprint though.</p>

<p>Chris, it&rsquo;s a treasure. I also have the same ITC specimen book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->THE ITC TYPEFACE COLLECTION<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s great since you can see all of the original alternates designed for Avant Garde Gothic, ITC Benguiat, ITC Zapf International Italics (no alternates for the roman), etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;26 good reasons to use (name of typeface)&rdquo; was the running sentence used for each weight of a typeface.</p>
<p>In the back, there is a definitive list of all the designers of ITC typefaces up until 1980, a detailed explaination of the &ldquo;ITC Concept&rdquo; and instructions to designers for submission of type designs.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate enough to get a copy from Aaron Burns when I was at Compugraphic (before Agfa).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That portrait of Picasso on the cover of U&amp;lc inspired me to create a portrait of [[Ed Benguiat]] using [[ITC Barcelona]]. We turned it into a poster and sent it to all Compugraphic Type customers.</p>
<p>One evening after one of Ed Benguiat&rsquo;s lectures, several designers and myself met him for a few drinks. I framed the portrait of Ed and wrap it up as a present and asked [[Janice Prescott-Fishman]] (designer of [[Shannon]] with [[Renee LeWinter]]), if she wanted to present it to him. Unbeknownst to Janice, I inserted a photo of a bikini clad beauty with Janice&rsquo;s face superimposed which covered the poster before I wrapped it.</p>
<p>Ed opened the present (with the back of the framed picture facing Janice), looked up a Janice, smiled and thanked her very much. Then he turned it around to show all us all. What a fun night! Janice, wherever you are, I hope you&rsquo;ve forgiven me.</p>

take another look at your issue of U&amp;lc with Picasso on the cover. I think you&rsquo;ll find the date of publication as Sept. 1979 (not 1989, unless they republished the portrait). Why take ten years off an &ldquo;antique&rdquo;.</p>

I think the book is supposed to fit the description you just made. When the original U&amp;lc issues came out, I liked the newsprint large format idea.  Admittedly, after 30 years in my flat file, the paper has gone pretty far south.  Since it was a give-away, cost was a factor then and each issue did not seem as precious as they do now in hindsight.  I threw most of mine away sadly while moving some years ago.</p>
