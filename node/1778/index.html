<div class=commentbody> This looks good. Fine work. <br> <br>What I like about the idea, even if it wasn't ment to be, is the way this type becomes a colour (gray) of its own. <br>Interesting would to combine this with a text type. In which you experiment with the width and the distance between the 'lines'. <br>You could even try to make a family with for example 9 wheights (10% gray, 20% gray, etc....) <br> <br>Jacques </div>

<div class=commentbody>It's genius, Andrew. Like the work on your site <br>it is both technocool and useful. Splendid. <br> <br>I don't see anything wrong with the '4', but I'd <br>like to see a 'y' with a tail like the 'g's tail. <br> <br>Do not give this font away. <br> <br>Stephen</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice, Andrew. Interestingly, I've done something <br>very similar some time ago: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1946.gif alt=typost.gif> <br> <br>In my case, it wasn't exactly a "scanline" font, <br>as I used both odd and even lines as I wished. It <br>was made for a small project, and I didn't bother <br>then to design all characters, only letters and <br>numerals. Also, some of these characters weren't <br>really worked up, as they wouldn't be used at all. <br> <br>I like the narrow fit of your characters, and the <br>color is quite even. <br> <br>regards, <br>R</div>

<div class=commentbody> Andrew, nice stuff. BTW, it reminds me a little of those letters on clothing/towel tags and such. <br> <br>---- <br> <br>Rodolfo, what about that font you used for your typographi.ca banner? (V2000?) It looks interesting, like it has *vertical* scanlines, and it's made of two fonts that combine in different colors or something... Wazzat? <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> thanks so much for the replies <br> <br>Jacques - I don't believe I fully understand what you're saying - but what I think are your ideas are interesting - I'd imagine transposing the 'texture' of this font under a different / more typical screen font could maybe lead to some surprises. <br> <br>the font came from a few different ideas, most prevalent was the old DOS boot-up screen font; I'm pretty sure that has the same 'scanline' look to it. also old fonts that worked w/ dot matrix printers... anyway there's gotta be at least a few fonts like this already in existence... like rodolfo's ;) <br> <br>found the limitations in making this font to be interesting though, which is pretty much why I made it.. I definitely agree with you stephen about the 'y'... sticks out like a sore thumb actually <br> <br>again thanks very much for your comments and ideas. it means a lot, I don't know what I'm doing :D <br> <br>- andrew </div>

<div class=commentbody>Andrew, make Paul Rand with his striped version <br>of City for IBM the first of us. ;) <br>Your face has merits, mine was an incomplete <br>one-off affair. <br>About the 'y': what's interesting is that you've <br>achieved almost an italic construction in letters <br>like b, g. Quite a feat, considering the <br>constraints. You should try to obtain the same <br>suppleness in other characters, like the y that's <br>been mentioned. Just as an experiment, I've tried <br>two alternatives to your y: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1948.gif alt=temp_ac.gif> <br> <br>I've also fiddled with the v and the d (in the word <br>'traded'). You could try to 'italicize' more your <br>design (italicize, not slant ;) <br> <br> <br>>Rodolfo, what about that font you used for your typographi.ca banner? (V2000?) It looks interesting, like it has *vertical* scanlines, and it's made of two fonts that combine in different colors or something... Wazzat? <br> <br>Hrant, that 'font' was done in fact for print. It <br>was a set of pseudo-bitmaps I designed to use in <br>a poster. The idea was that odd and even "vertical <br>scanlines" were differently colored - but with some <br>"pixels" out of place according to letter structure <br>(in the case of the typographica banner, *many* <br>pixels). This construction principle allowed different <br>shapes to emerge. I think I have an image of the <br>thing as it was used somewhere. If I find it, I'll <br>post it. V2000 was a codename (the poster was <br>called "Ver&#227;o 2000", which means "Summer 2000".)</div>

<div class=commentbody> it is maybe difficult to see, but i made 9 a's with 9 different stroke thickness. This leads to a kind of grayscale. <br>I used appr. 30&deg; angled strokes. And the distance between the strokes i in all 9 a's equal. <br> <br>This is the principle I meant. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Rodolfo, the changes you've made work well for me, especially the 'd' which is a great improvement - same with the two 'y' characters... I think I'll do more fiddling :D <br> <br>Jacques, I see what you mean. I doubt your idea would be possible for me - although it's worth trying, if only for the fact that it would be impossible ;) </div>

<div class=commentbody> It seems nothing hasn't been said, this *is* a very nice face. One thing I appreciate the most is that while it may qualify as a bitmap font by construction, because of it's color it is very readable as well as legible due to the fact that it does have a somewhat humanist bent. Very nice. -- As for usage, what about mobile phones or PDAs? </div>
