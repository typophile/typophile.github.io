  were set in (unless it was horribly bad to read). Working in advertising I didn\u2019t
  have to deal with setting large amounts of text (especially not prose) but rather
  designed in display sizes or tried to match the corporate content. But ever since
  I joined this forum I couldn\u2019t help it, I started looking up the fonts in books.
  Today I looked up the textfaces of the 15 books I read recently. All books are paperbacks
  (and novels), some older, some new (I buy quite a lot of used books).\r\n\r\nHere
  goes:\r\n\r\nCandida\r\nMonotype Garamond\r\nCaslon 540\r\nPlantin\r\nStempel Schneidler\r\nStempel
  Garamond\r\nRotis Serif\r\nStempel Garamond\r\nDTL Fleischmann\r\nITC Mendoza\r\nStempel
  Garamond\r\nStempel Garamond\r\nDTL Documenta\r\nMinion\r\nBaskerville (don\u2019t
  know exactly which one)\r\n\r\nStempel Garamond seems to be <em>the</em> bookface.
  Really lovely are the DTL-faces.\r\nAnd yeah. You may call me a geek."

    they named on the page listing the publishing info. Where would I find it?\r\n\r\nI
    recently saw a historical novel in the library I wanted to borrow. But after glancing
    over the pages, I couldn't. The text was actually in one of those faux-historical
    distressed fonts, maybe 17th or 18th century. I knew it would be unbearably distracting. "

    this whole thing and it took me quite some time to figure that one out (mainly
    because I didn\u2019t expect a paperback to be set in such a classy and expensive
    font)."

  body: "Handpicked and commented:\r\n\r\n<strong>Caslon 540</strong>\r\nBook: <em>Mason
    & Dixon</em> by Thomas Pynchon\r\nStory is set mainly in London and America in
    the 18th century.\r\nCaslon is historically a good choice, although the quality
    of the digitization of Caslon appears to be poor (too flimsy/light). A drawback
    are initials and chapter titles set in Bank Gothic.\r\n\r\n<strong>Plantin (Monotype)</strong>\r\nBooks:
    <em>Quicksilver</em> and <em>The Confusion</em> by Neal Stephenson\r\nParts One
    and Two of the Baroque Cycle (trilogie).\r\nStory is set all over Europe and beyond.
    It\u2019s Science fiction set in the 18th century.\r\nAppropriate choice. Plantin
    is the recreation attempt of the work by a 16th century Frenchman in Holland with
    the lowercase \u2018a\u2019 taken from another face. Historical Confusion. Artificial.
    Fiction based on historical facts. Baskerville might have been a good choice reflecting
    the transitional aspect of the time-setting and content, but maybe too correct.\r\n\r\n<strong>DTL
    Fleischmann</strong>\r\nBook: <em>Water Music</em> by T. C. Boyle\r\nActually
    in this case the typeface was listed with the publishing info (which I saw afterwards).
    A very cheap re-issue book (5 EUROs). Story is set mainly in London and Africa
    in the 18th century, about the exploration of the Niger by an Englishman. Fleischmann
    seems historically correct, but actually Baskerville (or Caslon) might have been
    a better choice, being more English. Fleischmann performs wonderfully, although
    being a Dutch extravaganza."

  body: "How interesting that Jan's fifteen recently-read books were set in twelve
    different faces. Presuming Jan reads American books, this gives the impression
    that US publishers use a considerable variety of fonts. This personal typographic
    census reminds me of a more ambitious project I tried (but failed) to launch in
    Italy about seven years ago. The idea was to measure the reading public's perception
    of book faces. \r\n\r\nTen examples of a double-page spread from the text of a
    historical novel (paperback size), each set in a font commonly used by Italian
    book publishers (Times, a couple of Garamonds, Palatino, Minion, well-leaded Utopia,
    ITC Baskerville, Galliard, Rialto, Bauer Bodoni) were placed on a table. These
    ten different fonts came off a quality laser printer on off-white bookish paper.
    Each sheet had the same nice margins and the apparent size of each font was the
    same. Each sheet was given a number corresponding to its font and was folded in
    the gutter to give a more accurate idea of an open book. \r\n\r\nWhile examining
    the specimens, readers were asked the following questions about the different
    fonts: 1) Which is the most classical? 2) which is the most contemporary? 3) which
    is the most familiar? 4) which do you prefer to read? 5) which is the most difficult
    to read?\r\n\r\nThe idea was to get a close idea of the reading public's perception
    of type and sort out the results according to: 1) sex, age, profession and residence;
    2) educational level; 3) number of books read in a year; 4) type of books prefered
    and names of prefered publishers. \r\n\r\nA nation-wide \xABopinion poll\xBB of
    this kind would need very heavy sponsorship. It would mean having interviewers
    behind tressle tables in (or near) bookshops or in open spaces like parks on Sundays.
    People would need to be relaxed and not in a hurry to spend time examining the
    specimens and answering the questions. I never got any further than playing this
    game with my typography students. But even in that teaching context \u2014 which
    was a fairly close facsimile of reality \u2014 it certainly helped to raise students'
    awareness of type.\r\n \r\n\r\n"

    \ >>\r\n\r\nWhen hiring freelance designers, art directors and production managers
    can help lead the way to use of new faces in book typesetting. I have just pulled
    down a bunch of books that had been in my charge over the past two years as Design
    & Production Manager for the Press of a state historical society. Here's some
    of the faces used by freelancers: Requiem, Kingfisher, Miller, Clifford, Malaga,
    Quadraat, Filosofia, Chaparral, Minion, Mercury, Paperback, Warnock Pro, Adobe
    Jenson Pro. (& one disaster set in Golden Cockerel far too small for good reading.
    But we were under a time crunch, and the manuscript had growed too much to fit
    into the desired page count. It still sells well, though.)\r\n\r\nThere are two
    reasons these designers used these faces. One is that I push them to, following
    my own practice of never using for text any hot-metal face I used in the years
    when I printed books letterpress. The other reason is that they are all good designers,
    able to understand that books they design will be printed better and will look
    better and read better if they carefully choose new faces, well-designed.\r\n\r\nI
    do not always like the faces they choose. Quadraat and Filosophia are not faces
    I'm drawn to for the work in my charge. But as good designers they can pull off
    good designs with these faces.\r\n\r\nAs for Plantin: I have yet to see a digital
    version I like. That's too bad, for I believe Plantin has inherent good qualities
    that could come forth if it were well digitized. Maybe now there's a good one;
    I gave up looking a while back.\r\n\r\nOther art directors & production managers
    for publishers should join me in pushing freelance talent in this direction. Onward
    with new types for new books!\r\n\r\npowers"

    was very presumptuous of me, wasn't it? Dear Jan, I'm the one who should be saying
    sorry!\r\nThat you refer to faces used by German publishers makes your report
    even more interesting. All I can say, by contrast, is that Italian publishers
    are far less adventurous. \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of Italian books are
    not designed at all but are simply part of an automatic production process where
    only the jacket is designed. That is one reason why \"safe\" Garamondish faces
    predominate inside the books \u2014 to the point of nausea. \r\n\r\nWill's report
    above also testifies to a design climate that is inspiring and lively. Nevertheless,
    an interesting wave of new Italian type designers has emerged over the past few
    years. And a very good-looking book showing many of them (Italic 2.0, published
    by De Agostini with dual English/Italian texts) came off the press three weeks
    ago. All I can hope is that Italian publishers start to open their eyes and put
    some of the young talent to good use. \r\n\r\nI agree about Plantin. Before the
    letterpress era ended it was unbeatable for texts in small sizes on art paper,
    and to think that it was produced in 1913, ten years before Morison set foot in
    Salfords!\r\n"
