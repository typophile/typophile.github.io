  aid/relief organisation, which doesen't send money in Africa like most of such orgs,
  but send the comptetent people - scientist - to share the knowledge there...\r\n\r\nI
  am searching for a suitable font.\r\n\r\nThe main target group are intelectual (a
  bit older) women in West Europe.\r\nBecause of the intelectual touch, the font doesn't
  necessarily have to be rounded and sweet matching only the aid aspect.\r\n\r\nGot
  some ideas?\r\nThanx\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Seems strange to me to be shooting font blanks in the air..

  body: "You're welcome.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to choose a direction for the
    \"tone\" of the identity - ie: friendy, progressive, intelligent, etc. Choosing
    a few adjectives to define the project will help generate more targeted recommendations.
    \r\n\r\nYou mentioned an intellectual audience, so maybe something more classic/bookish
    might be in order. If you want to appear friendly, then something like Gotham
    Rounded could work, although rounded type may be overly obvious and overdone.
    If you are going for a progressive approach, then the type could take a different
    direction."

  body: "I'm generally a bit turned off by Univers, mostly because it was pushed so
    heavily on me in the my typography classes. However, in this case it seems like
    it might fit for some reason.\r\n\r\nI'd also try FF Unit Rounded, Century, Serifa
    and FF Celeste.\r\n\r\nI agree with Chris in that it would be quite helpful to
    understand the tone to better suit it."

  body: "Thanks for the ideas!\r\nWell, I'll try to describe the tone of the identity
    now: \r\n\r\n- generally: people and the nature\r\n- exactly: sharing knowledge
    to help the people in africa\r\n- smart help (not money)\r\n\r\nThe Chris' idea
    of bookish/classical braugth me to the idea of making 2 proposals:\r\na) intelectual
    - matching the target group in europe\r\nb) friendly - an overall helping touch
    (rounded fonts)\r\n\r\na) gonna try out your proposals and FF Olsen and FF Absara
    as well\r\nb) I really like \"Haptic\". FF Unit Rounded and Gotham Rounded may
    work as well\r\n\r\n"
