  body: If you read all the hate mail I received after every Clearview article gets
    published, you wouldn't be surprised at all. It seems most people think the Federal
    Government paid me lots of money to develop Clearview when in fact they haven't
    spent a dime on the work. The sign makers do seem to be getting rich however.

  body: "The city of Toronto has been switching out their old street signs for new
    ones with Clearview for a number of years now. Mostly by attrition, so the cost
    over and above regular maintainable is negligible. I don't think the city told
    anyone about it :o). \r\n\r\nAlthough the sheeting materials are only guaranteed
    for 7 years, in practice, the service life of a retro-reflective sign in New York's
    climate can be as long as 15 to 20 years. They may still look OK after that time,
    but the retro-reflective quality of the material is significantly degraded over
    time so they eventually become useless at night. It's a safety issue. Nobody should
    have to tolerate having to try to read non-reflective retro-reflective street
    signs in the dark in a city like NYC. \r\n\r\nI would be willing to bet that that
    even within an 8 year time frame, the actual cost of replacing most of the signs
    would be covered by the cost of regular maintenance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I would think that many people feel that street signs that identify
    the names of streets, unlike major road signs - stop, yield, next exit - don't
    really have much influence on accidents. And they presumably also thought that
    those street signs, once put up, just stayed there - so that in 100 years, maybe
    5% of them would normally be replaced through regular maintenance.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    if those signs incorporate modern retro-reflective lettering, then their perception
    that most of those signs date from the 19th Century, and are just being torn down
    now by insensitive tax-money wasting bureaucrats is mistaken. But people do have
    a strong fondness for the familiar, and so they don't want a film crew to have
    problems filming a movie about the 1950s in their city, I suppose."

  body: "I suspect hard-to-read street signs would reduce accidents, by forcing motorists
    searching for their turn-off to slow down.\r\nOn the other hand, if they're spending
    longer peering at signage, that's less attention being paid to the road ahead.\r\nSo
    what's the diff?\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIf U&lc is so damn efficient, why doesn't commerce
    adopt this mode of roadside communication?\r\nInstead, strip mall stores go for
    the most \"illegible\" form possible -- Condensed Capitals in black, although
    the fluorescent background does help.\r\n\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe new street signs
    in Toronto are dreadful, because they're white lettering on dark blue. At night
    it's hard to locate the signs in the first place, before one gets an opportunity
    to read what's on them."

    street sign</a> in Bath, England.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bostphotography/3393751168/\"
    target=\"_blank\">  alternative</a> by David Kindersley which is fairly typical
    in the UK but still upper case.\r\n\r\nI would have thought there is some merit
    in retaining upper case to <em>differentiate</em> a street sign from a directional
    sign as on the London Underground where station names at the station itself are
    always set in caps. \r\n\r\nThe old ones look nice but I'm pretty sure the new
    ones are easier to read. The minute road safety is called into question, function
    has to take precedence over aesthetics. I think Kindersley was interested in both."

  body: I live in NYC and think the "outrage" is, at least in part, manufactured by
    that newspaper, focusing on the "big cost." Russellm is right - it's not much
    extra money, if any extra at all.

  body: Given that the United States is spending all this money because it is believed
    that street signs in all capitals are not legible enough (the thread about 14
    typefaces found on Berlin street signs makes me think the concern is overblown)...
    and thinking of Kemal Ataturk's decision to switch Turkey from Arabic script to
    Latin to increase literacy... <em>without</em> doing something as radical as adding
    a lowercase, or redesigning the script to fit it into a Latin-esque mold, have
    there been attempts to radically increase the legibility of the Hebrew script?
