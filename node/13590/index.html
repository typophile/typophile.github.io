  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">"Islamic Calligraphy; Calligraphy has a very special place in Islam, because it's strongly bound-up with the Quranic revelation in two ways. Firstly, God's word in the form of the Quran represents unique evidence of divine revelation, which was actually conveyed orally to Muhammad, but was then recorded in writing by his companions and circulated. Secondly, this revelation is described in the Quran as an "elegantly proportioned script," which is preserved with God on "spotless sheets of paper," and which is "beautiful" & "unsurpassable."

That's from:
http://www.islamicarchitecture.org/art/islamic-calligraphy.html

Does anyone know the whole and complete translation of this particular revelation?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It suddenly struck me that what David is looking for is a translation of the complete passage in which the Qur'an is described in terms of 'elegantly proportioned script' etc. I'm afraid I don't know the text well enough to be able to identify where this passage occurs, but it shouldn't be difficult to find a reference and check it in any of the various English translations.

On a similar theme, there is a Jewish tradition that Torah -- the Law --, preceding creation, was written by God on white fire in letters of black fire.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the Jewish classic Pirkei Avot, there is a passage where the sages try to reconcile the miracles in the Bible with the Greek concept of natural law. 

The way they reconcile it is by saying that all the miraculous stuff that goes against nature, such as Moses' staff, was specially created by God in the last moments of creation. One of the things that was created was the Ten Commandments, ready for Moses to receive. But to do this God also had to create "the script, the stylus, the tablets" (Avot 5:9). 

Thus according to the sages, God invented script, and so was the first designer of letters. As a typophile, I had to smile when I read this; it is somehow fitting that those who almost worshiped written language--and were often scribes--were comfortable with the idea that God invented writing.  

(ps John, 'Law' is not an accurate translation of 'Torah'. Some of the mystics thought that God first wrote the Torah, with the account of creation in Genesis, and then used it as a blueprint to create the world.) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, I checked some of the very few religious references I have, and didn't find anything specific to the script or the paper, but did note the following:

1) The "terrestrial" Qur'aan is a copy of the original that resides with Allah.

2) There is mention of Arabic being the divine language of the Qur'aan. But I guess it is possible to equate the script with the language in this context.

3) There is a hadeeth (which I think is basically external -but "official"- commentary) by Al-Baaqillaani that mentions something seemingly related to composition, if not the script or paper per se. In explaining the miraculous nature of the Qur'aan, he writes that "it is wonderfully arranged, and marvelously composed, and so exalted in its literary elegance as to be beyond what any mere creature could attain."

4) Muhammad was essentially illiterate before having the Qur'aan abruptly revealed to him.

5) The Qur'aan -although revealed as a book- is fundamentally phonetic. They way it's written, euphonically, it is claimed causes it to only be understood when sounded out (or least voiced internally). And this is why many people think you have to know Arabic to understand Islam.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanls for all that. I know Arabic writing is more closely associated directly with god than most, so  when I read this partial translation that seems to say, "preserved with God on “spotless sheets of paper,”..." I became very curious at the mixing of the concept of the script in God's hands, and... in a particular technology, even. . .  ya know, paper was pretty new then.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suspect that Hrant is right about it being not part of the Koran, but of the Hadith. (If it is indeed accurate.) I believe the Hadith is supposed to be things that Muhammed said to his followers, not as revelations from God, but as his own comments. These of course have authority with devout Muslims. There is a contact e-mail address on the site you link to, so I guess that would be the best bet to get an answer.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">To my knowledge, the Quraan never stated that the Arabic script is a divine or holly one. But the Arabic language was mentioned in many "Surahs", or Quaan chapters, as the language of Quraan without even adding any special status of Arabic other that its is the language of prophet Muhammad. Here is a link to some of them:  

http://www.quraan.com/Index.aspx?abindex=7&tabid=45&qst=2&query=Arabic

Questionable restrictions were placed later on direct translations but never on the script used for writing the Arabic text of the Quraan.  This why was transliterated in many scripts. 

As of Hadith, Hrant is right.  I have even read a "supposedly" Hadith proclaiming the "lam-Alif" ligature as a holly or chosen one.  But not all hadith is authentic stuff.  This is why the Quraan was there.

So back to David's question, I do not think the "Islamic Architecture" site was right. Quotes from the Quraan are always referring to a "Surah" and "Ayah".  What was theirs?
