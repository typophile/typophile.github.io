  a image/photo is place as a background image in dreamweaver, but when viewed in
  any browser regardless of scaling up or down stays relative to its surroundings
  at all times. \r\n\r\nPlease see example\r\nhttp://www.growmedia.ca/\r\n\r\nI'm
  told it can be done in CSS script but cant find it anywhere! Would someone be able
  to help on this? \r\nThis has been bugging me for a while!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n---\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    thing and looks like its the one. Just the \"small\" challenge of implementing
    this code into the html doc to get it all working. Its mind boggling!\r\n\r\nI
    don't suppose anyone else has got this working have they?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.buildinternet.com/project/supersized/\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "<code>&gt; body onload=\"check_bg();\" </code>\r\n\r\nThat ain't just HTML,
    that's calling a JavaScript function. If you check the .js file that is referenced
    from that page, you'll see it's a sizeable bit of code.\r\n\r\nBTW, it looks pretty
    suboptimal on my 27\". If you do do something like this, make sure your images
    are large enough\u2026 but also small enough (in terms of file size) to not annoy
    people on slow connections, or mobile devices. "

    at the moment on this so cant really post a link. I'm having trouble at the moment
    in getting my basic template together exactly how i would like, and where my knowledge
    is limited in DW becomes quite frustrating! \r\n\r\n@wormwood Many of the debates
    in the forums regarding this are on the subject of wether the best solution for
    this is HTML, Java or CSS and what works best.\r\n\r\nI kinda got this supersize
    thing working. In firefox you can download a hole site with the files and thats
    what i did with a site that had it. i deleted all there content and just left
    the supersize script in place. thats about as far as i got baring in mind i been
    working on it couple hours at a time.\r\n\r\n@frode its funny the link you posted
    is very much the layout i am trying to achieve! but where your menu scrolls with
    the content i was trying to make mine static menu when content is scrolled. a
    demo would be great!?.\r\n\r\nhere's a rough PS mock up of where i'm trying to
    get\r\nby the way the sites for me as well as free lance work i by and sell cars
    too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KARMONTEMPLATE_5180.jpg]"
