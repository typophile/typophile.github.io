  for Penguin.\r\n\r\nI am specifically looking for examples from the inside of the
  books, the type I mean.\r\n\r\nIf anybody could point me in the direction of a list
  of books too, designed by him, then I can head to the library to check them out
  for myself.\r\n\r\nHope you can help\r\n\r\nTom"

    focuses on the covers but would be a good starting point\r\n"

  body: "I strongly second Jan Tschichold, Designer: The Penguin Years. \r\n\r\nAs
    a side note, I had this book on order through Amazon for months.\r\n\r\nSave yourself
    the aggravation and buy directly from Oak Knoll. They are a good company."

  body: "Look for Penguins published 1948-9, in second-hand markets.\r\nIn Ruari McLean's
    \"Jan Tschicold, typographer\", there is a reproduction of the \"Penguin Composition
    Rules\", 1947, which was composed as if it were (4) pages from a Penguin, according
    to the rules. Nice bit of self-reference.\r\n\r\nHowever, although he left Penguin
    in 49, the book interiors continued to follow his Rules for many years.\r\n\r\nAnybody
    know when they stopped? "

  body: Yes, the McLean book is good, as well as, although the text is in German,
    "Leben und Werk des Typographen Jan Tschichold" by Werner Klemke, includes a bibliography,
    published by Verlag der Kunst in Dresden, 1988. With some info on the Penguin
    books, but also illustrations of many projects, type and design. Worth having,
    if you can find it.

  body: "I second Mclean's book: Mclean was Tschichold's under-study at Penguin -
    I'm not sure who left first? However, I would definitely not recommend 'The Penguin
    Years' by Richard B. Doubleday: the book has an incredible amount of inconsistencies
    and inaccuracies; furthermore, Phil Baines gave the book a scathing review in
    Eye Magazine:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eyemagazine.com/print/review.php?id=134&rid=677
    \r\n\r\nI would try 'Jan Tschichold: A Life in Typography'; 'Jan Tschichold, Typographer';
    'True to Type by Ruari Mclean; and then email St Bride library in London to see
    what they have in the way of books and advice. \r\n"
