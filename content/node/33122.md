  far, this is what I have:\r\n\r\nAdobe InDesign (all versions?)\r\nAdobe Illustrator
  CS or later\r\nAdobe Photoshop CS or later\r\nQuarkXPress 7.0 or later\r\nMellel
  (Mac OS)\r\nWindows Presentation Foundation (which would include what applications?)\r\n\r\nAnything
  else?"

    not use XeTeX) was color management -- particular for color images. While this
    falls outside your question, we had to jump through bloody hoops (our blood) to
    set books with color or duotone images.  '

    stuff, but not Contextual Alternates and a few other things.

  body: "Mark,\r\nIt seems the app developers don't think the greater public will
    care enough about opentype features to request them. There will have to be some
    compelling need arise for John and Sally Public to take an interest in it. Perhaps
    that is why only publishing apps support much of it. Even Quark is quite late
    to the party.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    The latter is a huge engineering challenge, which is why only a couple of companies
    have done it. If Windows Presentation Foundation and Cocoa provide easy access
    to this sort of functionality it might suddenly start showing up in all kinds
    of programs. Programmers love adding features, they just have a limited amount
    of resources. The trick is helping them get this stuff "for free" simply by using
    programming components that support it. '

  body: "I feel very torn by this lack of support. I'm very keen to ship fonts with
    advanced typographic support, but part of me feels that it is not necessarily
    in the customers' interest. In the bad old days, we had things like alternate
    characters in separate fonts, leaving it to the user to sort out. But at least
    it was a level playing field--no special application or OS support necessary to
    use alternate characters and such. With OpenType, if you don't have one of the
    few programs that fully support the fonts, you're stuck with a limited version
    of the font (in effect).\r\n\r\nI just got my Adobe CS3 upgrade today, and was
    disappointed by the relative lack of progress in the OT area. (I know, I should
    go make a feature request in the appropriate place.) In InDesign, for instance,
    it's even harder to find the OT stuff than the previous two versions.\r\n\r\nRealistically,
    I know that most people buying my fonts will have one or more of the first four
    programs on my list. But I really feel frustrated when I get a complaint from
    a Flash user wondering why they can only access the basic characters in an \"advanced\"
    font they just bought from me."

    of OpenType support in different applications and on different platforms. We will
    give an overview of the feature support, the existing bugs, problems and shortcomings
    related to OpenType fonts. The following issues will be covered in detail and
    will be demonstrated:\r\n-- Unicode support, Glyph naming and Encoding problems\r\n--
    Fontnames and platform compatibility\r\n-- GSUB vs. KERN : Kerning support\r\n--
    Ascender, Descender and Linespacing\r\n-- Overview of feature support in different

    (and third party developers' applications) as they do in Creative Suite."
