body: "I was implementing the 'hist' feature in a font which maps s to long s, and
  it initially seemed reasonable to me to include all accented forms of s in this
  feature as well, but I quickly realized that this would prove rather problematic
  for scedilla which, apart from looking really strange would play havoc with the
  fonts bounding box (the form of long s being used has a descender).\r\n\r\nI had
  no qualms about dropping scedilla.hist altogether since AFAIK all of the languages
  which use this character weren't even written using the Latin script until after
  long s had became obsolete.\r\n\r\nI was wondering, though, if anyone knows which
  diacritics *were* actually in use at the time when long s was still used.\r\n\r\nI'm
  tempted to only include sdotaccent (for Irish) and to drop everything else. I've
  seen long s + caron in some fonts, but those have all been blackletter faces which
  included long s as the base form and which, I suspect, included long s + caron simply
  because scaron is part of the standard windows character set.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thanks for the reference -- I was unaware that longs + dotaccent had its
    own codepoint.\r\n\r\nThe other characters in this range are mediaeval scribal
    abbreviations. Just to clarify, I wasn't planning on adding additional codepoints
    to support mediaeval usage. I was just wondering which s+diacritic sequences which
    are currently in use were also used at the time when long s was used, since many
    modern diacritical marks are relatively recent innovations.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
