<p>You Can Gain Credibility<p><p></p>
<p>Most consumers go straight to their nearest device to look for products and services. If you do not have a website, the customer will not be able to contact you directly, order your products and/or services, or even see what you have to offer. Customers also want to be able to research before they buy, and a website encourages them to do so, and with no pressure or strings attached.<p><p></p>
<p>You Will Save More Money<p><p></p>
<p>Most small business owners are in a pinch for some pennies, and think that hosting a webpage is too big of an expense at the moment. However, you cannot afford to not make one!

You can practically sell anything out there today, so reach out and make your website.<p><p></p>
<p>You Can Improve Your Customer Service<p><p></p>

You can include an FAQ page an answer in large, and have a private email to fix any mishaps with your products and/or services. You can have a blog for your page and give advice to your customers. Not having a website will hinder your availability to communicate with your customers and let them feel comfortable knowing that they can get a hold of you about having their problems fixed through a simple email or visiting the FAQ page.<p><p></p>
