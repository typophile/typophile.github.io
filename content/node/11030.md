  body: The red Scholes in the upper right corner looks like  <BR>somebody squished
    a very heavy weight of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/black/testdrive.html?s=SCHOLES%2018&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Optima</a>. <BR> <BR>My first idea for the Beckham one was a
    squished  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/abadi-mt/condensed/testdrive.html?s=BECKHAM%207&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Abadi</a>, but the crossbar of the &#39;A&#39; is lower on the  <BR>shirt
    and the &#39;K&#39; is all wrong. Maybe it simply is  <BR>a squished Verdana?
    <BR> <BR>Shevchenko&#39;s may be a squished <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/serpentine/medium/testdrive.html?s=SHEVCHENKO%207&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Serpentine</a>, but  <BR>I can&#39;t make out on the scan if
    there are serifs. <BR> <BR>BTW I hate it when people squish fonts...
