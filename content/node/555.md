body: Yes, I&#39;m a newbie. This is probably one of the easiest fonts you all have
  ever heard of, but I&#39;ll admit to being a beginner idiot and beg the mercy of
  the Font Court to please just tell me the name of this font &#40;and maybe where
  I can find a .ttf file of it?&#41; Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding

    would be Jim Parkinson. Check out <a href="http://www.typedesign.com/logos/wash.html">his

  body: I&#39;d guess custom as well. Teethmarks? Yeah, I&#39;ve still got proof!
    =D Here&#39;s a nicely little bit of trivial information for you.  <a href="http://www.nytco.com/pdf-factbook/Facts_About_NYT.pdf"

  body: FYI -- though the dictionary does agree with your use of &#34;masthead,&#34;
    the term traditionally meant the section of the newspaper that includes the information
    about the paper, including staff, management, ownership, circulation, etc. The
    name on the top of the front page is traditionally known as a flag or nameplate.

    <BR>First thing I checked. ;&#41; I half expected it would show up  <BR>in his
    portfolio, but nope. <BR> <BR>Nice bit of trivia, Tiff &amp; Chesh. I learn every
    single day.

  body: Thanks for all your help, you guys. That NYT .pdf is fascinating indeed. I&#39;ve
    learned lots.. But, alas, I still don&#39;t have a name for the flag/nameplate
    font, or the directions to a .ttf of same. Anyone? <BR> <BR>P.S. This is a very
    cool forum.. Lots to read and absorb.
