body: I&#39;m trying to generate some PDF files from Microsoft Word. The font we use
  is Luc&#40;as&#41; de Groot&#39;s CorpidOffice. We don&#39;t have a PDF license
  for it, so I don&#39;t want to/can&#39;t embed the font in the PDFs. I&#39;d be
  happy to let them appear in Adobe Sans. But the problem it, no matter what I do,
  the font is embeded. I tried generating a PS file first, then distill without the
  font activated, or adding CorpidOffice to the &#39;never embed&#39; list, but apprantly
  the font is always included when Word generates the PS file. Any ideas?
