<div class=commentbody>Cooper Black = 80s? you're talking about the 1980s right? Hmmm. <br> <br>When I remember the 80s I remember Memphis style with lots of wavy lines and Univers Condensed Oblique set on an angle to match the slant. Remember that? <br> <br>And Charles S. Anderson and the retro, rubber stamp feeling. Maybe some Torino or Corvinus Skyline or Fenice. Or maybe even just some Cheltenham Condensed. <br> <br>I also think of early Neville Brody stuff -- Industria, Arcadia. Or maybe early Emigre -- Modula, Senator, Base 9. <br> <br>That's some of what says the 80s to me. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>Cooper black How does a 20s typeface have an 80s flair? :-) Still used as VIVA TVs principal font, though... Eerie, to see that font on young music television... Fonts with massive 80s flair, imo are the various works of Neville Brody, mostly available through Fontshop and Linotype. The standard, non Fontshop-modded DIN-Schrift also was very big, at least in Germany, in the 80s, used in a mag named TEMPO. Not a font from the 80s, but it fit the cold and sterile tone of the times. Many Emigre Fonts stem from the 80s, especially their bitmap work like Oakland. Also, Modular and Triplex suggest themselves, but I'm not sure they're from the 80s originally. Also, if we go late-80s, there were already some Instant Fonts in Use. VERY late 80s, we got the Beowolf by Letteror. Despite being called the Helvetica of the 90s, Erik Spiekermanns Meta was originally created in the mid-80s and somehow has an 80s Flair, imo, till today. Also, if you look at Vaughan Olivers stellar work, a nice step back in history is okay, so even Garamond and Sabon or specimen from old books can be used. </div>

Never really dug all of her work, but yeah, she's quintessentially 80s/90s. <br> <br>Also, but already more 90s, there of course is Alexander Branczyk, who did the Frontpage magazine and a very Carsoneque-with-a-Kraftwerk-Twist-style for Berlin Techno Music. <br> <br>And there are many free fonts featuring fonts used on music albums during that period, eg. from The Cure. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Cool. Over here in Germany, imo, it was a least up to a certain degree because of Corel Draw in te late 80s and 90s...

<div class=commentbody>true... I think it carried over to early 80s a little though. But you're right, very Welcome Back Kotter. <br> <br>maybe bold serifs, slab serifs... for TV titles (always the cast etc., very utilitarian) I think I've re-noticed while indulging in a steady diet of re-runs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Any Oz Cooper typeface is eternal, for me. <br> <br>Although I don't agree any typeface stops looking decent, as everything is the basis for the future, I can say my impression (from graphic design) is you would get the most of eighties design from the following: <br> <br>1) Industria (Adobe) <br>2) Franklin Gothic and Franklin Gothic Condensed (mostly used in bold and extrabold). <br>3) Compacta <br>4) City (Berthold) <br>5) Eras (ITC/Letraset) (yes, Stephen is right!) <br>6) Enviro (ITC/Letraset) <br>7) Frankfurter (ITC/Letraset) <br>8) American Typewriter <br>9) Harlow (ITC/Letraset) <br>10) Santa Fe (ITC/Letraset) <br>11) Serif Gothic (ITC/Letraset) <br>12) Tiffany (ITC) <br> <br>For a display type crying "1908s" and stuck in them (for now) Enviro, Santa Fe and Harlow are the best for me. (I hate Enviro but I'm following the brief). <br>Serif Gothic and Eras are also very OK for a more formal look. <br>If you want to look a bit "too fancy for my cat", Tiffany is fine, instead. <br>Steve (ITC/Letraset) it's from 1973 but it recalls a lot the "future past" attitude of the 1980s first videogames generation. A lot more than Data70 or Countdown and Amelia, more connected to their own 1970s. <br> <br>I hope I have spotted something suitable for your poster. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>Come to think of it, almost ANY ITC font <br>looks '80s-ish to me. <br> <br>Well, I thought the same thing but I was afraid to be gunned down cold by the CIA... er, the ITC. Letraset and ITC. The rotten but sometimes wonderful times of dreaded photo-typesetting and transfer types. And lowercase figures slipped into oblivion...</div>

<div class=commentbody>ITC Garamond was very big in the '80s. Goudy Oldstyle and Les Usherwood's stuff was pretty popular in the early '80s. Later on with the desktop publishing boom, probably because of the limited quality type choices at the time, you saw a lot of the "LaserWriter 35", especially Palatino. The first few batches released by Adobe skewed things a bit, causing a revival of sorts of Century Oldstyle, Trump Medaeival, Optima, Bodoni and some others. Used to see Futura used with ITC Baskerville a lot. Bernhard Modern and Onyx were both pretty big. None of these really says EIGHTIES the way some of the others that have been suggested do, but these are ones I recall seeing a lot.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also, stretched type was more common as an intentional design effect (as opposed to nowadays when it's mostly done by people who don't know any better).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wouldn't you think that the fonts which were digitized first could be pigeonholed as "very eighties"?</div>
