Correct. Its like "Love & Peace" out of the 70ies.
If the designer had a good dope?

I think what bothers me about this is the "r" -- if it were more in keeping with the size of the other letters, the balance would be better. As it is now, you get the feeling the drugs were wearing off and it was late at night.

<div class=commentbody>I can just imagine the specifications for the contest:
"Must portray a long history of tradition while being relevant to the present and future. Must incorporate references to every culture in Europe while representing a single unified vision. Must include at least one letter in a typeface by David Rakowski."
Okay, maybe that last one wasn't a real spec, but I would bet that something like the other two were. The judges probably each had an idea of what they wanted the logo to look like, and this conflicted with everyone else's idea. I've seen this kind of thing happen before.

I personally don't like it very much, the accents bother me a bit buy hey, we don't know what the brief was, so why chastize the designer, we have all done stuff we are not particularly proud of at some point. No?

<div class=commentbody>So the idea of portraying a nation in a fun, childish way, is ok?
Or would that be better to portray it in a corporate way?
Which way is the best to visually represent a country? Are some countries more "fun" than others? Are some countries more serious than others? From which point of view? The EU is not really a country, is it? It's just a set of agreements and laws so what's the point in giving it a "fun" look? </div>

<div class=commentbody>>Ahem…forgot what happened last time we decided to criticise the cover of CA? Remember the author intercepting the conversation and the crisis that followed?
I've said it before, but I think if the designer wants to step up to defend their work then we should welcome that, hope everyone posts comments with that in mind. As GW said "Bring it on!" - the CA tread was different it degenerated into politics and Rolex discussion.
A better example would be the Typographic Heresy Book thread where the designer was a good sport and came onboard to set the record straight.

Of course I was kidding (btw: Gerad Huerta's intervention about his AC/DC was brilliant too)
The CA discussion degenerated into politics and I think this one has got lot of potential for this too...but I think the CA one also degenerated because some comments where slightly ...catty towards the designer (my comments included of course) which is why I think the best way to approach this kind of critique is always by considering the reasons behind a specific logo and see it in relation to what it was trying to achieve and the brief.</div>

I think that's the key - don't say anything you wouldn't say to them on the phone - after disabling caller ID, and disguising your voice with a device purchased from Radio Shack of course... "where is the Rebel Base?" ;-)

I'm not sure the designer needs to defend it - I think we GET it - and it's better than most of the finalists.</div>

I like that.
I will digress for a moment:
A long while back I posted a montage of signage in my neighborhood - there is absolutely no coherent look and quite frankly a lot of them are really poor designs…
but
When many people started chiming in how signage needs to be so much better executed and typographically sophisticated, I tried to imagine what that would look like and I didn't like what I saw. I just don't want to live in a world where everything is kerned and spaced and immaculately executed. That notion really bores me.
Now may I have a little cheese with my whine? :)

The French still weren't happy about anyone else expecting them to use or expect them to speak English the last time I was there. Hell, I think they were one of three countries that refused to announce their Eurovision votes in English. Somehow I doubt that they'll be especially happy that the EU is using English in a celebratory logo.

Then you wouldn't have won. It's pretty obvious… :)
I don't like really analyzing graphics anymore, I try to just let them effect me, and this felt like fun. It wasn't taken too seriously and right now I can really appreciate that.
Actually this thread has cemented a direction I was toying with and now feel really committed to.

I don't know about fun, but childish certainly fits the bill for Brazil. The vast majority of the population can be manipulated just like little children. And the little children are about to re-elect big daddy Lula so the party can rage on for another four years.
Maybe both the EU and the Brazilian logo are private jokes for the people who commissioned them.</div>

Wow. I agree with you again (I agreed also with the issue of visual pollution etc..on the other thread btw) but since I am not Brazilian I feel bad about dissing the country I am living in...
If you had said something similar about the US (and I think Bush certainly deserves the same treatment you gave Lula) you would have immediately people at your throat calling you anti-american and blah blah blah...if you know what I mean.
Anyway, talk about waste of money...you probably know the marca brasil. Also tons of money ( and I mean a ridiculous amount of money considering the much more urgent issues) involved in a survey to find out how people see Brazil...the author of marca brasil told me the survey involved asking half the planet what do they think when you say Brazil. Then they picked only the positive things, right? Cheerful, sunny etc etc. so I imagine they had to descard all references on violence, pollution. poverty etc since it would not have any use for the logo anyway. Do you follow me? So why bother asking if then you take only what you want to hear. Now that is a bloody waste of money if I have ever seen one.
The marca Brazil for those who don't know, it's used to identify products made in Brazil for export. I am not criticising the thing in itself just the waste of public money for the survey. Just give the designer a brief for fcks' sake and take it from there!

Would I want to do it (if I was a designer)? Yes, but not until I have enough real world experience.
And let's not talk about the "it's so bad, it's good" aesthetics, please. As we can see from this <a href=http://www.pingmag.jp/2006/09/27/handmade-balinese-typography/>example</a>, it's all about the intention of the designer.</div>
