  body: I am pretty sure that it is. There are stokes added to the characters and
    the type is curved in the image... but that is Rockwell.

    memory is better than mine. I find as I get older playing \"name that font\" gets
    harder.\r\n\r\nBut thank you for your help."

  body: I think you may have mixed up the images in the thread. The first image on
    the top is of a football advert and then you posted another image of this upholstered
    flag. I am really confused too because you put an orange 'D' on top of the image
    that could be a number of typefaces and then you compared the new image with the
    old image. I am trying to help but I don't think I can.

    RUGBY I'm looking for.

    ID for this particular face (and it could even be a custom design), I came up
    with many lookalike fonts by typing \"college\" in MyFonts' search window:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=college"
