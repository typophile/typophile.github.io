  body: ">>>How Greek is it?\r\n\r\nHow Greek do you want it to be?\r\n\r\nThere are,
    broadly speaking, two schools of thought:\r\n\r\n(1) That the Greek characters
    should reflect the traditional Greek ductus (whatever that is) and that your Greek
    glyphs will generally be more lively and cursive than the Latin.\r\n\r\n(2) That
    there are some designers who use Greek who want to have a more 'Westernised' look
    to their Greek glyphset (so there is nothing to distinguish between, for example
    a latin /v/ and a Greek /nu/). \r\n\r\nPeople (dare I say, purists) seem to be
    far more critical of (2) than (1), by the way.\r\n\r\nYour Greek glyphs will sit
    somewhere on that spectrum between (1) and (2) and it is entirely up to you where
    on that spectrum it sits.\r\n\r\nAs far as individual glyphs are concerned, and
    without wanting to be critical, I would say you have tried to do the Greek as
    quickly as possible, making your solutions to individual glyphs the ones that
    are easiest to execute from a Latin starting point. These may not make the best
    Greek glyphs for the font. At the end of the piece, there is no substitute for
    studying a wealth of Greek fonts and deciding which shapes are the ones that you
    think comfortably suit Seaside, rather than the ones that can be drawn most easily
    from existing Latin, even though that may mean more work.\r\n\r\nN"

  body: "thank you, Nick\r\n\r\nit is exactly the question. as far as i can see, some
    of greek type-designers chooses 'western' look for their new typefaces, like [[http://parachute.gr]]
    or [[http://fonts.gr]] do. so i hope i can choose this way if 'traditional' way
    is not so clear for me. \r\n\r\nas native cyrillic reader i know examples of cyrillic
    from latin people who wanted go deep into 'tradition' and gave so much <em>coleur
    locale</em> so such cyrillic became more foreigner that 'latinized' one.\r\n\r\n"
