  Looks like modified Futura (TEE) Bold to me.\r\n\r\nI think the R gives it away,
  but I am having doubts with the S. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_3446.png]"

  body: "I think it's ITC Avant Garde Gothic Bold (which has a close-loop default
    R unlike other digital cuts of Avant Garde, surprising for such a high profile
    face\u2014although of course this is the \"original\"). It also has all those
    famous leaning letters: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-bold/glyphs.html"
