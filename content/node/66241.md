  body: I like the revisions you've made. The question mark reads as such, and next
    to it the exclamation does as well, but I'm not sure if it would on it's own -
    it might just look like a strange fish swimming north. Will you be pairing them
    with type?

    don't need to be super-readable \u2013 they're supposed to be somewhat illustrative
    \u2013 but I'm happy if they manage to communicate that they \xABsay\xBB something

    repeatedly; so whoever sees the exclam fish would likely have seen the question
    fish before."

  body: Definitely see the fish/question mark clearly. For the exclamation mark you
    might make the connection to the dot thinner, or make it connect straight, as
    exclamation marks don't generally have curves -- may help it read better.

    a much larger scale. one concern on all other mentioned applications is size.
    you will lose detail/focus on the question fish. love the mark though. =)

    mark modular/flexible, so the fish and the type (of which there are four grades
    of \xABcoarseness\xBB) can also be used individually, as well as both in combination,
    depending on context/media/size etc. For instance in the favicon we ended up going
    with just the fish. I hope it's working out :)"

    be curious how/where you see that, because honestly I don't. If you mean that
    the fish is sharper / more detailed / more clearly defined, then yes, but to my
    eyes that doesn't make them mismatched (not in execution; not any more than a
    fish with anatomical details would have to be different from semi-dissolved floating
    junk).\r\nAnd funny that you see the cross in the \"a\": It's in the font, and
    I was going to remove it because I thought it was too obtrusive/visible, but the
    client liked it as a semi-hidden mini-reference to the fact that this blog is
    written from a specifically Swiss perspective. :)"

    a thought...what if the dot was a drop (of water). That'd allow you to disconnect

  body: "To be clear: this thing is final, it's live, and I'm really happy with it
    (and so is the client), so I'm not expecting to make any changes. I do however
    appreciate the discussion; I'm aware that I'm breaking some conventions with this.
    \r\n\r\nThe fish is not: \xABa logo\xBB; and it's also not a piece of punctuation
    that happens to be shaped like a fish, sort-of matching the style of the rest.
    That's primarily a fish looking at that crap and wondering. He's also shaped like
    a question mark, because he's wondering. (The fish could maybe be described as
    a \xABmascot\xBB for the blog, if a word is needed.)\r\n\r\nPiecing the fish together
    from junk would be wrong conceptually. The fish is inherently something else than
    the junk. They still inhabit the same design space, at least to my eye. The friction
    between them is the friction that <em>must</em> exist between fish and junk, which
    by the way isn't always clear-cut: For instance, fish eat this micro-plastic trash
    (when it's red or orange) because they think it's shrimps. \r\nSo I don't think
    the 2 elements can really co-exist quite \xABharmoniously\xBB \u2013 not even
    contrasting enough to be nicely harmonious again! This entire thing is meant to
    be slightly off-harmonious at second glance. There is micro-friction, and there
    are little contradictions, and that is deliberate. It's part of the message.\r\n\r\nTo
    me it does work, just not exactly the same way as such logos/graphics often do.
    And if it were more conventional, more clear, more balanced and comfortable (not
    that I honestly believe it's <em>that</em> jarring!), I believe that might well
    make it prettier, but likely also worse at conveying the message I need it to
    convey."
