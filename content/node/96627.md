  body: "All three, on the personal side of it I wanted to use foam board as a medium.
    So I sprayed painted the white board and the cut away the top layer of thick paper
    which is laminated to the board's foam on each side.  I exposed the textural 'emotion'
    of the inner surface leaving the back layer of thick paper and inner foam attached
    to express the word.  Back lit this technique is quite powerful too.\r\n\r\n At
    first I wanted to say ReLUCTANT but apparently LUCTANT ain't no proper word. Which
    kinda troubles me. How can there be RELUCTANT  if there ain't no LUCTANT in first
    place??? f'k\r\n\r\nThe choppy crude blocks of letter shapes with their separated
    letter elements to me suggest an edgier attitude (as opposed to flowing script
    for example but that would nice too having just thought about it). Done to agitate.
    And together with the technique explained above hopefully that expresses a sentiment
    (inner or otherwise) felt by some in our current time seen in the context of many
    different situations - as an example ... participating in voting or in organized
    religion.\r\n\r\nn.  "
