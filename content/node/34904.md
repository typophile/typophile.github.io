  CONCERT.\r\nEspecially, if you look at \"C\",\"R\",\"S\",\"G\",\r\nC is not fully
  round shape.G is not there but there is no tail under Spur of the letter G.\r\nI
  really would like know what font they used. i am pretty sure its new type that its
  been created by someone.\r\nthank you very much for your help!\r\n\r\np.s its bit
  similar to franklin gothic. but not exact.\r\n    i need to know exact name of this
