  body: "Sizemore is interesting! I guess it requires tight letterspacing to make
    the ligatures work, which is more difficult with this style than with the original
    monoline sans, to my eye. But a really cool idea.\r\nCongrats and good luck."

  body: "Thanks, Craig\r\n\r\nI love Ambicase by the way!\r\n\r\nYeah the tight spacing
    is to get the ligatures to hold together.  I can increase the trracking a bit
    and they still look like part of it but too much and I have to break the ligatures
    apart.  I only see it as any use for headlines, and maybe sub-headlines without
    the ligautures and increased tracking.  I never envisioned it being any good for
    text of any length, that's the main reason I didn't bother with a lower case."
