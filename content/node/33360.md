  old business card by the client.  I have searched high and low for an upright cursive
  font that looks likes this and am now not sure if this is even a font.  This logo
  has been around for about 20+ years so it's possible this was handwritten.  I'm
  just sure I've seen a font like this.  Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much, Trina[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FinnegansLogo-Scan_4382.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for the font references.  I resigned to the fact that this was probably
    a handdrawn logo, so I will be scanning and tracing to replicate.  However, seeing
    the other font faces helped to expand my resources for future projects.  Thanks
    so much!
