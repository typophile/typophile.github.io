  assignments require us to get feedback from other people. My current assignment
  is to design a wine label and get feedback.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help and give me
  some constructive criticism on my designs, it will be greatly appreciated! I'm still
  getting used to photoshop, illustrator etc etc. So please take it easy on me and
  please keep in mind that these are just quick drafts to give you an understanding
  of how I want my designs to look. \r\n\r\nTHANK YOU! (:\r\n\r\n"

    not general design. While you may get some answers, you probably would get more
    feedback in a forum targeting designers.\r\n\r\nI will say your grapes look distorted
    and shouldn't.\r\n\r\nNow, if you have a type-related question, this is the place
    to come -- and you're always welcome."

  body: "I like the lettering in \"Ben's Blend\". If you did that using bezier curves
    I would say its pretty good for an Illustrator beginner.  If not learn bezier
    curves by trying to reproduce this lettering curve by curve. The yellow outline
    with the red inside is too busy - Make the outline stroke thinner. Better still
    make the outline thicker with a lighter color, but do not add an outline stroke.The
    thin red type on black is illegible - use a thicker font and/or much lighter red.\r\nAnd
    the grapes are distorted - why not use illustrator's brush mode to make a simple
    illustration for the grapes instead this nondescript photo?\r\nGood luck."

  body: Remove the outline stroke on Ben's Blend and fix the horrible distortion of
    the grapes. The dark background is also not a great idea for a wine label.

  body: "Welcome to Typophile. \r\n\r\nAs others have mentioned, the grapes don't
    look right, it looks like the proportions have been altered by reduction of the
    height. \r\n\r\nAnd in the small type, the combination of burgundy type on a black
    background can be difficult to read because of the low contrast, especially for
    older customers, or for anyone in dim lighting. I'd suggest a lighter type color
    (maybe that light yellow you're using) for the small type, and switching to a
    bolder script.\r\n"

    your alignment.\r\n\r\n(for my 2\xA2)"

  body: "<em>These forums are for people whose primary interest is type and type technology,
    not general design.</em>\r\n\r\nWhy? Shouldn't people who are interested in type
    also be interested in how it's used? Type doesn't exist in a vacuum. Maybe I'm
    biased because I'm a graphic designer, but I feel the best type designers are
    the ones who understand how people use type \u2014 people like Kris Sowersby,
    Tobias Frere-Jones, Erik Spiekermann, etc."

    matter.\r\n\r\nBTW to me the best type designers are those can imagine how type
    <em>should</em> be used, as opposed to simply filling mainstream demand.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In addition to the feedback already given, I wouldn't make such prominent
    use of script faces. With every text you add in script, the other texts become
    less prominent and less impressive. You might want to use a script for the name
    and use a roman typeface for the lines you have set in a script typeface. You
    need to focus more on the hierarchy of the typography.\r\n\r\nI also have to ask
    why you would want to censor our feedback. Why should we go easy on you? So you
    don't have much experience yet, I don't think you should expect us to be vile
    in our comments either way. If I ask for feedback I want it uncensored. It might
    hurt, but I will learn a lot more from it. By \"going easy\" on you, you might
    not get the most out of feedback."

  body: "Since you posted this a few weeks ago you're probably not still looking for
    feedback, but:\r\n\r\nWhat about this wine makes it different than other wines?
    Who's going to drink it? How are you going to appeal to that person? Since it's
    an Australian wine, maybe you can look into using Australian typefaces?\r\n\r\nIt's
    a blend, right, or at least that's what the name says? Maybe you can do something
    playing off of that \u2014 maybe the word mark is a script made up of multiple
    differently-colored \"threads\" that twist together to make the letterforms."

    fairly certain you're not a Helvetica lover, Hrant, but using Neue Haas Grotesk
    is a real pleasure."

  body: Oh, also, get off of the computer and sketch. You say that you're still getting
    used to Photoshop, Illustrator etc, so trying to get your ideas out in a computer
    is slowing you down a lot right now.

  body: This is off-topic but I just had a look at Neue Haas Grotesk and I wouldn't
    be anxious to use that. I can't stand Helvetica though. I think I prefer Unica
    over Neue Haas Grotesk, but I feel in contrast to Helvetica, ironically Neue Haas
    Grotesk doesn't seem to pretend to be something it's not.
