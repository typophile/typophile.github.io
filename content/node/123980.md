body: "Recently my web browser (chrome) started displaying little blocks instead of
  text.\r\n\r\nHere I have an example of the problem (from the yahoo login website):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schermafbeelding
  2015-03-22 om 19_4703.28.50.png]\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to solve this and since
  this is sort of a 'typographical' problem I thought you guys might be able to help.
  \r\n\r\nHere is a larger image of the symbol:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schermafbeelding
  2015-03-22 om 19_5400.38.36.png]\r\n\r\nI can still copy and paste the text and
  it will display the right text, so I think it has to do something with the font.
  Anyone have any idea what might cause this problem?"

  body: "Can you use Chrome's developer tools to find out what font this is <em>supposed</em>
    to be?\r\n\r\nIt's a Last Resort font -- that is, this is what should be shown
    <em>if all else fails</em>. However, there should be no reason it fails with (clearly)
    regular text. This suggests either your Chrome is broken, or there is something
    wrong with your system font setup. (Did you recently decide to \"clean up\" your
    system fonts and throw away everything you thought would not be missed? Stuff
    like that...)"
