  Many glyphs are changed to look more like Frutiger...

    can you check if it has Armenian? Last year I consulted with Microsoft on their
    addition of Armenian to Segoe, and I'm curious to see what ended up where.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "1I2Q8...\r\n\r\nAs a UI font, the originals were much better designed, in
    terms of clarity and distinction. At least the Latin. Are the correct fonts being
    compared? Because originally Segoe and Segoe UI had different forms: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe\r\n\r\nAnd
    the (apparently) older UI forms are indeed better for UI, despite looking less
    good at large sizes. But that's not what it's really for.\r\n\r\nWhat gives?"

  body: "I like Lucida better with most of it's forms, actually. Except the uppercase
    aye and lowercase el. Although it also isn't pretty for large sizes. Plus I'm
    quite happy with Lucida Grande's Hebrew, where some MS fonts go in the wrong direction
    in a couple places.\r\n\r\nBut I get your point. There are some sad design decisions
    that happen at Apple. Both companies really don't have great typography. Just
    some spots are rougher than others."

  body: "Regarding size and style, it is worth noting that the new Win8 Metro UI makes
    use of some larger sizes than previous versions of Windows. In the Metro start
    pane, the text is notably large, and numerals in particular feature large in mobile
    device displays for things like time and date displays. So the change to the design
    of the numerals probably relates to this, and the desire to make the forms more
    sensuous at the larger sizes.\r\n\r\nOf course, what would be cool would be size
    and resolution dependent shapes for letters like I, so that the bars could be
    present at small sizes but removed at large sizes for display use. This is the
    sort of thing that one could have done with hints in a binary rendering, but which
    is difficult to control in today's subpixel and asymmetric greyscale environments."

    \"Of course, what would be cool would be size and resolution dependent shapes
    for letters like I, so that the bars could be present at small sizes but removed
    at large sizes for display use.\"\r\n\r\nThis is still cool on the Mac OS. And
    I think \"letters like me\" is proper English.\r\n\r\n\"This is the sort of thing
    that one could have done with hints in a binary rendering, but which is difficult
    to control in today's subpixel and asymmetric greyscale environments.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    really mean rendering's gerfucked on windows. On the mac OS, it's still possible
    for the type designer to make serifs disappear without the user changing either
    OS or rendering technologies, and on the mac iOS sufficient resolution obviates
    the need. Compare and contrast;)\r\n\r\nOr... recall past opinions that \"competitive\"
    rendering helps users?  There is no competition between the Mac and windows or
    between windows and anything other than windows. I think it's pretty clear that
    the competition between windows XP rendering, windows Vista rendering, windows
    7 rendering and windows 8 rendering... is what's \"kilt\" windows, with the replacement
    of efficient instructions like Mirp by do-it-yourself (and processor-intensive)
    instructions like Msrp leading the massacr\xE9.\r\n\r\n\"Hopefully there will
    be a blog post at some point that describes the various font updates in Windows

    anyone ever state such an opinion? What I recall saying is that it was evident
    that MS, Apple et al were treating text rendering as an area of competition, rather
    than of cooperation, and that still seems to me a simple statement of fact. I
    never said that such competition helped users. Did someone else?"

    in return is a frank diagnosis of your MS allergy, which seems to lead to \"the
    enemy of my enemy is my friend\" concerning a certain fruit. I don't mind a company
    doing damage as much as I mind intelligent people pretending it's actually doing
    good. When I look at Apple, I mostly see what MS was a couple of decades ago.
    And when it comes to our favorite topic, even if one believes that MS spends their
    funds on the wrong type designers, it's better than not spending any. A slick
    UI and shiny packaging do nothing for me; and I'm sad they do too much for too
    many.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
