  I really enjoy Aviano Flare ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-flare/]])
  but I can't seem to find any similar typefaces that spark the same emotional feel
  as Aviano. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated as I've been searching
  for a few days now. Thanks in advance!"

      Thanks for jogging my memory for that one. \r\n\r\nI'm looking more for a flared
      serif than sans - so something like Diamond would be better than Platinum. \r\n\r\nI
      just hate when clients ask \"something like Trajan\"... \r\n::shudder::"
