    support, Jos? (To be honest and selfish, I only care about Romanian.) \r\n\r\nAnticipanting
    your next blog post (\"Museo sans gains glyphs\"), I'd like to say: \"Have a fruitful
    weekend!\"\r\n"

    beautiful work, as we've come to expect from you.

  body: "Not at all condescending, Dan and thanks for commenting!\r\n\r\nMuseo Sans
    will have the same language support as Museo (including Romanian) and will also
    have \"extended\" numerals: lining tabular, lining proportional, oldstyle tabular,
    oldstyle proportional, nominators, denominators, superiors and inferiors. In total
    exactly 500 characters per font."

    My intention indeed. Hope it will work out that way. I'm thinking about making
    a condensed also and maybe an extended, but first I'm going to release this. It
    still has to be spaced and kerned though (by Igino and iKern).\r\n\r\n"
