  (is there a difference between the digital releases by DTL and Monotype?) and Scala,
  but also Minion. Bembo and Dante are as well fine typefaces with fine italics, but
  have in my opinion a too literary tone.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m in search of \xBBmy\xAB
  typeface and have compared a lots of fonts. Albertina, Scala and Minion are clean,
  clear and neutral typefaces with (and that\u2019s importent) wonderfual crisp italics!
  I consider to purchase a license for the MT Albertina Pro, but first want to be
  certain that I didn\u2019t ignore an alternative.\r\n\r\nIf you have some alternatives
  in mind, please let me know! Thank you.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMario"

  body: "I like Minion very much and used it a lot. As usual in Slimbach's works,
    it's a very well designed typeface \u2013although I never liked the wide kerning
    for digit 1 in both lining and oldstyle variants.\r\n\r\nDante is also outstanding,
    but there isn't a pro version of this family. So it lacks useful OT features.\r\n\r\nI
    think Scala italics works perfectly in small amount of texts. But if you have
    to format a whole paragraph with it, the appeareance becomes a bit obstrusive.
    Scala's numbers are also good just if you use it rarely due to its somewhat ornamental
    oldstyle approach.\r\n\r\nI'd consider two alternatives:\r\n\r\n<strong>Iowan
    Oldstyle</strong> has a design similar to Minion, but with wider glyphs. Works
    very well in books. The family went pro recently. Anyway, as many Bitstream/Monotype/Linotype
    fonts, the pro version is not so complete as Adobe's ones.\r\n\r\n<strong>Novel</strong>
    is another great alternative (probably my pick nowadays). The family is very complete
    and was released in late 2009 with a large set of OT features. You can see more
    here: [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/buro_dunst/novel_pro_family_complete_ot/]]."

    looks very promising to me. The italics are especially neat.

    was a text family comprising Latin, Greek and Cyrillic, designed by Dutch calligrapher
    Chris Brand in 1965 and issued by Monotype for photocomposition.\r\n\r\nThe face
    was first digitized by Frank Blokland at the Dutch Type Library and released in
    1996. The DTL version offers Greek as well as a book weight of the Roman. Blokland
    is credited as the designer of Albertina MT, so the underlying data for the common
    weights should be the same."

    like the two-storyed (I\u2019m not certain wether or not this is the right English
    word) \u203Ag\u2039 from the italic. But all in all it is a fresh and clear typeface.\r\n\r\nat
    Freiberger: Iowan Oldstyle is nice, but I still would prefer Albertina, Scala
    or Minion. With respect to Novel I have to say, that I don\u2019t like the italics
    very much.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s about <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/dante_pro_virtual/\">Dante
