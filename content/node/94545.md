  have added a glyph  \r\nto  arabic font  of which the  unicode was supplied by the
  unicode consotium this year. its a dual joining glyph (that joins on both sides)and
  it has two form medial and final.its unicode is U+0620. But it does not join like
  other glyphs.it remains in its isolated form . i need to change its joining type
  from default joining type(which is non-joining or U) to dual joining( D).I dont
  know how to do it. i m using FONTLAB  STUDIO 5.0 as my tool.\r\n thanks in advance"

  body: The problem is not in the font. OpenType Arabic relies on script shaping engines,
    e.g. Microsoft's Uniscribe, to analyse character strings and determine which OTL
    substitution features to apply to each character. The shaping engine makes this
    determination based on Unicode character properties. So for any Arabic character
    that the shaping engine knows about, is has a record of whether it is non-joining,
    dual-joining or right-joining, and then applies the appropriate layout features
    depending on the position of that character in the text string. The problem you
    are observing with U+0620 is almost certainly because the shaping engine does
    <em>not</em> know about this character because it is a new addition to Unicode
    and the shaping engine has not been updated to include a record of its properties
    and how to handle the layout.

  body: "No, the shaping engine is an operating system or application component.\r\n\r\nIn
    what software are you testing your font (including version number) and on what
    operating system (including version and service pack number if any)?"

  body: "Microsoft Office and Windows both ship with versions of the Uniscribe shaping
    engine. Word will use the Office version of Uniscribe.\r\n\r\nTry testing your
    font in Notepad, which will use the Windows version of Notepad. This will reveal
    whether U+0620 is supported in that version, although I doubt it since the character
    was added in 2010. That was probably too late for Windows 7 and probably even
    or Office 2010.\r\n\r\nI will write to some colleagues at Microsoft to find out
    whether U+0620 is supported in the upcoming Windows 8 version of Uniscribe."

  body: As I thought, the character was added to Unicode too recently to be supported
    in Windows 7. I'll let you know when I hear back from contacts at Microsoft re.
    Windows 8.

    8. We updated the existing shaping engines to Unicode 6.0.\r\n\r\nOffice 2010
    won't shape this character on Windows 8, though, because Office uses its own internal
    copy of Uniscribe which matches Windows 7.</blockquote>"

    copy of Uniscribe in Office. I haven\u2019t done it in a long time so I don\u2019t
    remember how. But for individual users or small groups, this is a possible temporary
    fix once the updated Uniscribe is available."

  body: I have not done this recently, but if you have an updated Uniscribe and can
    locate the one used by Office on your system you can simply replace the usp10.dll
    file. However, I don't know if this still works (there were concerns about usp10.dll
    as a possible security risk some time ago, so access to it might be more restricted),
    and it probably voids your warranty and may be contrary to the Office license
    agreement.
