  is a font management program for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. Many users of graphic
  design tools have so many fonts that they cannot keep them all active at once in
  the system. A large number of active fonts may degrade application performance as
  well as make it difficult to find fonts.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion, released in January
  of 2006, merges two separate Macintosh font managers previously sold by Extensis.
  One of the font managers, Font Reserve, was previously sold by Diamondsoft before
  it was acquired by Extensis. Suitcase Fusion combines the most popular features
  of both products. For example, Suitcase Fusion retains the straightforward, easy-to-use
  interface of Suitcase X1. It adds to this a key Font Reserve feature, the Vault.
  The Vault is a centralized repository for fonts and font metadata. Both Suitcase
  and Font Reserves can upgrade their databases for Suitcase Fusion.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vault_5935.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  location of Suitcase Fusion's vault is /Users/YourUsername/Library/Application Support/Extensis/Suitcase/Suitcase
  Font Database.suitcasevault.\r\n\r\nIf a user needs to move their Suitcase Fusion
  to a different user or system, they can do so simply by moving the Vault, and placing
  it in the same relative location.\r\n\r\nAnother feature taken from Font Reserve
  is face level activation for Macintosh font suitcases. With most font managers,
  fonts are activated as a suitcase, which means that all of the variations packaged
  in a suitcase, turn on at once. This would commonly be the book, italic, bold and
  bold italic weights, but some families have many more variations. Face level activation
  makes font conflicts far less likely because only the needed parts of a suitcase
  can be activated.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion also features auto-activation plug-ins
  for popular design applications. Documents opened will automatically activate the
  fonts they need. If a user has more than one font with the same Postscript name,
  Suitcase uses an Extensis-developed technology called FontSense to determine which
  font was used in the document. Currently plug-ins are provided for InDesign CS ,
  InDesign CS2, Illustrator CS, Illustrator CS2, as well as English and Japanese versions
  of Quark 6 and Quark 7.\r\n\r\nIf an application does not have a plug-in for auto-activation,
  Suitcase can still intercept its font requests and activate the font. However, for
  applications without a plug-in, only the Postscript name of the font is used. This
  can be less precise if there is more than one font with the same Postscript name
  in the Suitcase database.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion works with all fonts that are compatible
  with a given operating system. On Macintosh systems, this includes PostScript Type
  1, TrueType, and OpenType.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion is localized for English, French,
  German and Japanese.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion version 12.1.1 is compatible with Mac
  OS 10.3.9 and later, including both Intel and PowerPC systems. Suitcase for Windows
  version 9.2.2 is compatible with Windows 2000 and XP."
