  dissertation on the use of <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/37424\">typography
  in architecture</a>. Everything that was said in that thread was really useful and
  interesting, but my tutor's now suggested that I shift my focus a little so I'm
  back to appeal for more ideas!\r\n\r\nBasically my tutor feels that simple lettering
  on buildings has been done before, so he's now suggested looking at lettering in
  the environment where the structure of the text influences the structure of the
  building/installation. I think this is a good idea in principle but I'm just not
  sure how many good examples of this I could actually find. The best so far is probably
  <a href=\"www.tern.org.uk/art-flockofwords\">Flock of words</a>. Other examples
  I've been looking at include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Little Sparta garden
  by Ian Hamilton Finlay and the work of Joan Brossa.\r\n\r\nI don't really think
  many of these derive their structure from the structure of the text, more that the
  user's experience of the lettering is important to the way it's understood i.e.
  rather than taking it all in in one go you walk through it and experience it in
  a particular way that's relevant to the text. This in itself is probably an idea
  that could be developed further and I might well end up going with this instead.\r\n\r\nTo
  be honest I'm feeling a bit out of my depth, it's getting a bit 'arty' and conceptual
  and I'd really appreciate any ideas or examples that might be able to help me out!
  Anything near London would be a plus in terms of visiting the site itself.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    likely to yield much in the way of suitable examples. Perhaps we type-centric
    folks might be fond of such an idea but I doubt if you will find many architects
    with the same leanings. War memorials are the only structures that come to me
    as well or similar things like the Holocaust Museum here in Washington. There
    are numerous memorials which have lists of names or famous words inscribed (Lincoln
    Memorial, etc.). You will probably find several in the UK. I recall Dan Reynolds
    photographing some WWII sites over there. You might find some more ancient ones
    from the Roman Empire as well. Look up Armando Petrucci's book \"Public Lettering\"
    for some historic sites.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    found lots of really interesting stuff to do with architecture/sculpture and lettering,
    but not much of it really lends itself to a particular dissertation question,
    so I've got quite a lot of background info but not much substance!"
