<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ap_6302.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/qz_4761.jpg] I partly post this to see if anybody can take a crack at what typeface this is based on, most likely hand done. But I was wondering if anyone can give me some insight about these screens. I bought them in a junk shop, apparently they had been there a long time. The ink is still on them. At first I had guessed it was used by sign painters, but it seems impractical for individual letters to have a screen that big. Why would someone need a complete alphabet like this?
*Note the % and ! as well as the extra s,t,e. They are about 4.5 feet wide and 2 feet tall. The letters are approximately 10 inches high. Thanks</div>

<div class=commentbody>Good question. I bet you a pound to a bucket that this is a hand lettered set. Also there is no room to swing a squegee on these frames - barely room for a clean pull, if you know what I mean. Nice Q. Can't think of a practical application - I expect something will turn up.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One possibility, suggested by the extra S, T and E: someone was making movable letters for a sign board. I have a few sets of these, along with a nifty backlit sign. The letters are a gothic style (something like yours), and they're printed on heavy, white plastic cards. You make up the words letter by letter, sliding the cards into a slot on the front of the sign. I got the whole deal for a few bucks at a yard sale. It even included a box of dingbats, arrows and punctuation. Couldn't afford NOT to get it! (Now guests in my living room amuse themselves by making absurd messages.) Just one possibility.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the feedback. Skyfein, I thought about the moveable letters before also, and that makes the most sense to me. Now that I think about it more, the inclusion of the ! and the % but not any other glyphs seems important. Stores advertising sales and other events would definitely use 50% off, and SALE! Although there aren't any numbers. Makes the most sense though. Thanks.</div>
