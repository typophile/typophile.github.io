body: Hey there fellow typophiles, I am a design student in need of some help. I need
  to create a logotype/brandmark for myself. My name is Nico and I think I have settled
  on a design I like that utilizes Gill Sans regular with some illustator work added.
  I want to know what professionals think about it just to see where I am or if I'm
  just kidding myself. Absolutely any critique or question you have is welcomed, good
  or bad. thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5948.jpg]

  body: "I read nicc?\r\nYou should work first in black & white, and add colour later.\r\nAlso,
    working with geometric and/or stencil visuals, n appears out of place. Adding
    a gap in it could resolve both problems.\r\nFinally, you should revise spacing."

  body: Agreed; part of the problem may be that the stencil-type gap in the 'o' is
    wider than the spaces between the letters, yes?

  body: "\\i\\ \u2013 \\c\\ needs some more space. It looks like you messed up the
    stencil-o \u2014 it\u2019s not symmetrical. Start with the proper o and use a
    gap that has a relationship with the thin part of the \\n\\. To complete the look
    and maintain logic you should also cut the \\n\\.\r\nReposition the dot on \\i\\
    - it should be centered on the stem!\r\n\r\nCoulourwise: there is too much contrast
    between the olive-shade and the dirty blue. Up the olive."

  body: wow! thank you everyone for your advice these are things which I would have
    never caught. It helps getting a look at it from a different pair of eyes, especially
    if those eyes are professionals. I'll definitely fix the spacing and try something
    with the n. Thanks a million everyone.

- body: "Once you make all the changes mentioned so far...maybe, just maybe, apply
    the same treatment to the tittle? Perhaps just add the break without a counter?
    Shrug. It might add interest and continuity, it might not. Worth checking out
    at least, IMO. \r\n\r\nI also recommend printing your work in progress, in multiple
    sizes from an inch upward. It may seem counter intuitive since you can zoom on
    a computer, but it's amazing what you see on paper that you miss on a monitor.
    Oh, and I agree with Riccard0 that working in black and white is an absolute must
    until the design is finished. Add color last.  "

  body: The tittle is not directly above the stem of i and it's a little too small.

  body: Great, thanks for the advice, I'll try the tittle with a break and see how
    it looks. and I definitely have to work in B/W .
