		<div class="commentbody">Well, think of it this way: now one company can sit on font design software instead of two. At least FontLab is still free from being stored in the warehouse next to the Ark of the Covenant. <BR> <BR>How many times has Adobe ended up owning Freehand now? Two? Three? <BR> <BR>It would be nice if Adobe got the Macromedia product teams to pay the same attention to detail to their code that they do to their own. Dreamweaver is a sluggish, kludgy mess on the Mac, and the last time I tried to use Freehand, I gave up in disgust after like 5 minutes. (I remember when Freehand was much easier and more fun to use than Illustrator, but I guess that predates Macromedia's acquisition of it by a while. 4.x was the last version I really liked.) <BR> <BR>And both companies are a pain when it comes to the cycle of annual, painfully expensive product upgrades. At least Adobe writes reasonably speedy, usable software; maybe that will rub off on Macromedia. I wonder how much of the acquisition was just so Adobe could get their hands on Flash, though&hellip; interactive SVG never took off the way they wanted it to.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Fontographer: it is very unlikely indeed that Adobe's purchase of Macromedia will lead to a new version of Fontographer. It is much more likely that the produce will be retired completely, and will simply no longer be available. <BR> <BR>The history of Fontographer and FontLab has shown very clearly that for a large software company like Macromedia or Adobe a font tool is simply not worth development investment. The potential market is simply too small to interest them. Font tools need to be developed by small companies seeking a niche market, and FontLab has demonstrated that this approach can be very successful. <BR> <BR>I suggested some years ago that Macromedia should simply give the Fontographer code, including the aborted 5.0 version, to Jim Gallagher. He has spent a good portion of his life nursing this code and providing tech support to Fontographer users, so if there is any future to Fontographer it seems to me that he deserves to guide it and to benefit from it, if possible. Perhaps Adobe might consider this. They have been generously supportive of the makers of FontLab, DTL FontMaster, etc., with their OpenType SDK code, so clearly encourage competition in the font tools business. Giving Fontographer to Jim for a dollar, and letting him do whatever he wants with it &ndash; which might include open sourcing it, I suppose &ndash; seems to me the best thing that could be done with this product. Otherwise, it might as well be withdrawn from the market, because it is never going to be updated by Adobe or any other large software company.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Or that the Flash format might be merged with SVG, an open format?&quot; <BR> <BR>That's being optimistic. My guess is that SVG will just be dropped by Adobe altogether and yet another standard thrown out the window. ;o) <BR> <BR>Adobe clearly bought Macromedia for Flash (and maybe eHelp). Even Macromedia was falling behind with their apps. I love freehand, but the last two releases were feature bloated buggy POS releases. DW is getting along in years. FW never really blossomed fully (great app, but still needed a lot of polish.) <BR> <BR>Just a hunch, but I'm guessing they'll jetison Freehand and Fireworks, keep Flash and maybe Dreamweaver, and sell of cold fusion. <BR> <BR>Definitely bad news for the graphic design industry, though.  <BR> <BR>In regards to apple, they are already competing with Adobe with things like Final Cut Pro. <BR> <BR>Coincidently, the other winner may be open source&hellip;with renewed interest/support in some of the apps out there.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the suggestion that Adobe might give the Fog code to Jim Gallagher. Poor fellow! He's spent years lobbying Macromedia without success, and now he has to start over with a new set of corporate goons. But as for Adobe <em>giving</em> away anything away? Je crois que non.  <BR> <BR>Otherwise I think it's very bad news. Competition is the only thing that makes products good. Apple has proved this again and again: how it is possible to do things that really do make it worthwhile to pay twice as much for a computer. For those who can afford it, it's a very nice situation. Photoshop has been in strong need of competition for years, and it is striking that nobody seems to be able to get in there and do it. Illustrator is now even more likely to stagflate, I fear, having taken its best recent ideas, now 8 or so years old, from LightningDraw GX. What a pity that Corel couldn't do a better job. Or Macromedia, for that matter.  <BR> <BR>I find it interesting that Quark 6.5 now has considerable Photoshop-like functionality, and this is only bound to increase. One can see clearly that the competition from InDesign has strongly benfitted Quark. Remember the dizzy days when Quark nearly took over Adobe?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's striking that so much of the reaction I've seen in the press is about the business end of the deal, and almost none of it is how the users of the software, in particular creators, are affected by it. The same weird sense of disconnect haunts me when I read the interview with the CEO in PC Magazine. The SF Chronicle was talking about how the combined Acromedia can shove more &quot;interactive content&quot; (read: &quot;ads&quot;) at &quot;consumers&quot; (read: &quot;poor suckers&quot;, namely us) with the Flash / Acrobat juggernaut. In businesslandia, this seems to be seen as a win, rather than a horrible lose / lose situation for all of us. <BR> <BR>Am I being needlessly gloomy? Are all of us here? Am I unreasonable for being disappointed by a situation in which I can pay $500 a year for the kinds of improvements that used to be given away for free in incremental updates, now that the tools I use are mature platforms, and I have no viable alternatives to choose from if I grow discontented with what I've got? I use Adobe CS because I think Adobe's tools are the best out there for what they do, but still, as CS becomes more like Microsoft Office for Designers, it would be nice if there was more competition to push things forward.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My own speculations: <BR> <BR><b>The Good</b> <BR>Using fonts in Flash will not be a chore&hellip; it'll just work, and work <BR>beautifully. <BR> <BR>Flash files will now include letter-spacing info. (Oh, stop  <BR>freaking out you paranoid font developers.) <BR> <BR>Adobe will redesign the Flash and Dreamweaver interfaces.  <BR>Mmm, buttery cohesion at last. <BR> <BR>Adobe will finally dump the leftover drawing paradigm and tools  <BR>from FutureSplash (the app Macromedia bought and renamed  <BR>Flash) in favor of Illustrator-inspired tools. (Note that already  <BR>Illustrator to Flash is a much better workflow than even  <BR>Freehand to Flash.) <BR> <BR>Flash Lite (the Flash player for mobile apps) will have the clout of <BR>the Adobe marketing/PR muscle. (Whether they can get room on  <BR>the stage alongside Brew and J2ME outside of Asia is another  <BR>issue.) <BR> <BR>Adobe After Effects and Premier will include the ability to export  <BR>to FLV (Flash's video format). Good for Adobe, bad for Apple,  <BR>perhaps bad for Sorenson. <BR> <BR><b>The Bad</b> <BR>Acrobat will finally bloat itself into oblivion by now including  <BR>capabilities for FLV 'movies', and scalable vector art in the PDF  <BR>format. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader will get bigger and more  <BR>bloated with every release. (Long live Apple's Preview). <BR> <BR>Adobe, recognizing the huge installed base of the Flash plugins  <BR>will include the ability to display PDF content in the Flash plugin.  <BR>The plugin will get bigger, slower and more unwieldy. <BR> <BR>It'll take about 6 years before third-party developers have  <BR>anything good enough to spur the giant back into innovation. <BR> <BR><b>The Ugly</b> <BR>Pure speculation here&hellip; but if Apple alienates Adobe any further  <BR>(ala the way Final Cut was so far beyond Premier for the Mac that  <BR>Adobe turned tail and ran) they could potentially stop  <BR>developing the Flash plugin for Macs. (Now that would suck for  <BR>Mac and would inevitably weaken Flash.) <BR> <BR>______ <BR> <BR>But I'm an optimist. I don't live in fear of Microsoft taking away  <BR>Office from the Mac and I won't live in fear of losing great  <BR>Macromedia apps. <BR> <BR>The real question, beyond this fun speculation is, will Adobe  <BR>really understand the power under the Flash hood (talking about  <BR>ActionScript here). Flash is not just a designers toy any more. If  <BR>they let the Macromedia Flash team continue moving it forward  <BR>it will continue to compete head-on with Ajax as a rich internet  <BR>application platform, accessible to everyone.  <BR> <BR>Will Adobe understand that Flash for Mobile has some seriously  <BR>great potential as a tool that many designers/developers already <BR>know how to use? (It's just a matter of convincing carriers  <BR>to use it.) <BR> <BR>I hope so.</div>

(Adobe is also a tech company and they understand design.)  <BR> <BR>Joe, you are focusing on the companies, and imagining what may happen to specific product. But the real issue here is a general ethical one, which is whether the means justify the end. If the end is &quot;good software&quot;, is it OK to pursue that end by means of a monopoly? <BR> <BR>No, because that amount of power corrupts. It's not that the people in the companies &quot;know they have no competition&quot; and deliberately produce sloppy product. It just happens when all the power is concentrated in one place. <BR> <BR>If the market, in the form of competition, or government, in the form of the Securities Commission (or whatever) is not going to keep the system in balance, that's a problem. <BR> <BR>it doesn't matter how brilliant or well intentioned people are, or what wonders they have achieved in the past, they go bad if they acquire too much power. Sorry to get preachy, but this is a basic of human nature which every age, blinded by its own brilliance, is apt to forget.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's true that flash is a platform now. Remember how hard Apple (Quicktime) and Microsoft (Windows Media) have been fighting to establish and control the de facto video player for the web? While they weren't looking Macromedia snuck in an took it with the flash player. Macromedia didn't even begin to exploit the power they had over the media market. I really doubt if Adobe cares much about Macromedia's apps. They want to control the platform that now defines media on the web, and if it works out like they think, will define mobile space as well. In this way Adobe really will compete with Microsoft.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Darrel, in some ways your perception of Flash as a gimmick, a toy, is based on how people have used it and not for what it is <BR>capable of.&quot; <BR> <BR>Absolutely no argument there, Joe. I completely agree, as a technology, is has all sorts of uses. <BR> <BR>BUT&hellip;and a big but&hellip;the reality is that it's never taken off beyond a bell-and-whistle thing for 99% of the web. Much to MM's dismay, I'm sure. <BR> <BR>The business pundits are saying this merger is mainly about Flash, but few pundits have really pointed out that Flash really isn't all it was originally supposed to be. Remember when Adobe had grand illustions that the entire internet would be PDF based someday? I think they realized that (thankfully) never happened and are now latching on to Flash hoping for the same&hellip;though they're a few years to late. <BR> <BR>&quot;On mobile devices it has the potential to become <BR>the UI for a mobile OS, not merely so you can 'make stuff move'.&quot; <BR> <BR>Well, again, you are absolutely right. But the reality is that Flash was exactly that for the desktop world, yet it never became so. <BR> <BR>And, again, I think the mobile industry is becoming increatingly gloated with a perception that people actually want all of this. Some do, of course, but the 'mobile' web has been around for years and still isn't the huge thing everyone had hoped it'd be. <BR> <BR>&quot;And you can keep just making phone calls. Ten years ago people <BR>said, 'why would I want to carry a phone around with me?'&quot; <BR> <BR>With each phone upgrade over the past decade, making a simple phone call has become increasingly more difficult. Handheld interface design is perhaps the best example of crappy interface design out there today. ;o) <BR> <BR>As for Avalon, it's a feature for feature's sake. MS has the money to market anything without any worries. If it sticks&hellip;Great. If not, well, at least they made the competition chase and waste money on a silly non-feature ;o) <BR> <BR>&quot;They want to control the platform that now defines media on the web, and if it works out like they think&quot; <BR> <BR>I agree. Their mistake is thinking that that is, in fact, Flash. <BR> <BR>Again, I'm not bashing Flash&hellip;I used it like anyone in the heydays of the web and still find it very useful for certain design, but it just never took off as that thin-client that everyone had hoped for, and, in the interim, DHTML (namely with Ajax) has seemed to be embraced in record time.</div>

And of course, there's a huge difference between those and nice-guys-wearing-suits. <BR> <BR>I'm sure most of the folks at Adobe (like our esteemed friend Mr. Phinney-wearing-jeans) are good people, passionate about the software they produce. Gruber's complaint is that Adobe's CEO has very different priorities; he'd rather improve Adobe's standing in the jerks-in-suits market than in the creative market (since the creative market's $2 billion per year isn't enough for Adobe any more). The Macromedia acquisition is part of that strategy.</div>

<p>I use 3-4 computers at any given time. When I buy software that has to be activated, it&rsquo;s assigned to a computer&hellip;not to me. Which is silly. Though it certainly pads their bottom line.</p>
<p>MM did come out with a nice system of 2-computers with one license (the idea being one desktop, one laptop)&hellip;but they made the inane requirement that they both be the same OS&hellip;which is rather silly when speaking of web development.</p>
