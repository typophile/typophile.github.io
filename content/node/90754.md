  distort/stretch a typeface. For a current project I'm creating a Luxury Magazine
  masthead. I'd love some feedback on what I could possibly do to create a slightly
  condensed version of FF Holmen.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/holmen-typophile_4076.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  the above image I've just vertically stretched the typeface to create the condensed
  feel I'm after. Is there any corrections I should make to the anchor points? or
  is this something I could get away with?\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated."

  body: The relationship between the crossbar of the A and its thin vertical would
    be one place to refine. That probably will have ramifications on the V. Probably
    take a look at the center of the S and the width and length of horizontal and
    vertical serifs. This is one very rare case where stretching hasn't caused major
    problems, so you are lucky!
