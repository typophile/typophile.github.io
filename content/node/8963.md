  body: Other than the fact that ascent &#43; decent should &#40;normally&#41; = em
    square, I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s not working for you. Are you perhaps using
    the descent line as the baseline? If that&#39;s the case, just move everything
    up 250 units.

    you&#39;re using FontLab? Either unlock the Vertical Metrics layer and drag the

    The problem &#40;or at least part of the problem&#41; is that you are drawing
    the characters far outside the boundaries of your font. The ascent and descent
    lines are where the topmost and bottommost parts of your characters should normally
    stop. If you extend parts of characters beyond those limits, they will get clipped
    off when you use the font in most programs. <BR> <BR>I would suggest spending
    some time with the Fontographer manual, go through the tutorials, etc.

  body: After trying every botton on the keyboard, I discovered a prompt up in the
    header that tells me to hit command, 8,9, or 0. This seems to give me the proper
    point type substitute, but the curve point still looks like a corner point and
    behaves that way if I drag it. By holding down the option key ands puling on the
    handles, it behaves like a curve point, but how terribly awkward! <BR> <BR>I hope
    Fontlab is not so clumbsy, since I am planning to switch to it soon. <BR> <BR>On

  body: Matt, is it possible for you to post the Fontographer font file here? &#40;Not
    the generated TrueType of PostScript font&#41; There seems to be something fundamentally
    wrong with the way you&#39;ve set up the font. <BR> <BR>Jim, FontLab uses a different
    system for curve/line transition points which may make more sense to you. These
    points can be designated as smooth or not smooth. Smooth gives the same effect
    as a tangent point in Fontographer when a line a curve meet. The control point
    of the curve is aligned to the angle of the incoming line keeping the transition
    between the curve and the line smooth. When the point is set to not smooth, the
    control point is unconstrained allowing the transition to form a sharp corner.
    The smooth/not smooth thing works with the transition between curves as well except
    that it keeps the control points on either side aligned, again creating a smooth
    transition. This is the same as a &#34;curve point&#34; in Fontographer. <BR>
    <BR>I sure hope there are other people familiar with Fontographer to help answer
    some of these Fontographer questions. I switched to FontLab cold turkey over a
    year ago and would rather forget about Fontographer and all the stupid little
    tricks you have to learn to use it effectively. FontLab is way better.  <BR> <BR>And
    Matt, as it seems you are just starting to learn about making fonts, I would suggest
    using something like FontLab&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/TypeTool/">TypeTool</a>.
    It&#39;s cheap and easier than FontLab, and you won&#39;t be learning to use an
    obsolete and virtually unsupported program &#40;Fontographer was last updated
    in <i>1996!</i>&#41;. Plus, you can upgrade to FontLab later if you decide you
    like this sort of thing. Just a friendly suggestion.

  body: Jim <BR>Fontographer set a default value of 800 for ascent and 200 for descent,
    so obviously if your font goes beyond this default setting you have to do what
    Mark has shown you. If you did not comply with the default settings, then the
    program was a bit unforgiving, causing you to have to check the &#34;automatically
    compute em square ...&#34; as Mark shows.  <BR> <BR>By the way, I use Type Tool
    2 and find it excellent and you can upgrade if you like to FontLab as was pointed
    out. Further, there are a lot of things about Fontographer that are annoying,
    lousy manual, etc., but one of the most irritating is what is referred to as &#34;grid
    spacing.&#34; If you do not select all of the points and then select the &#34;Align
    Points to Grid&#34; command, you get points without integral numbers; in other
    words, instead of 120, 66 horizontal and vertical measurements, you will get fractional
    hundredths, like 120.223, 65.97 &#40;from the manual&#41; measurements. This might
    sound silly, but it can be problematic. Type Tool automatically does away with
    decimal percentages like this and effectively snaps to a grid. Mind you, Fontographer
    was the choice of most for years, so I shouldn&#39;t complain too loudly. And,
    just to add one more thing, &#34;auto spacing,&#34; and &#34;auto kerning&#34;
    were never a good idea because the results were always lousy. Not to say that
    I didn&#39;t try.

  body: Matt, Jim, et al <BR>I opened your file to look. Just a note - as there is
    some overlapping of forms in a couple of the glyphs of the font, first select
    all of the points in that particular glyph, then go to the Elements drop down
    menu, and then select &#34;remove overlap.&#34; This happens when the points actually
    are directly on top of each other, not when the forms overlap but the points of
    the forms of the glyph are in different places. Anyway, have fun with this. Font
    creation is always an adventure.

  body: Hmm. From what you say, it sounds like you&#39;re running OS X. There are
    some issues that affect font developers having to do with the system font cache
    in OS X. Try giving the font a different font name when you generate the font.
    It could be that the system has cached a copy of the earlier version and is not
    showing the new one. <BR> <BR>There is also a utility called Font Finagler which
    will clear out your font cache if you don&#39;t want to change the name. Changing
    the name is easier, though, since clearing the font cache requires restarting
    or logging out and back in. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know for sure that this is what&#39;s
    going on, but it seems likely.
