  in the UK, imaginatively entitled 'Golf Pages', and we are currently redesigning
  the Logo (and most of the magazine). \r\n\r\nThe old logo was in ITC esprit, and
  a little tired. However, the new logo suggested by the creative director is in Alba,
  and looks a little too-cool-for-school. \r\n\r\nWe're trying not to alienate the
  traditionally older audience (or the PGA who officially sponsor the magazine) but
  also to give the logo a bit of life to it and make it a little less stuffy. I was
  thinking of a modern looking serif rather than sans, as i feel it suits golf a little
  more.\r\n\r\nHowever...the company wants to use a font we already own (in other
  words they're tight) and I don't think any of those we own are right, so I might
  buy one myself if its about \xA320-30. \r\n\r\nanyway here are the old and prospective
  new logos. \r\n\r\nAny advice or suggestions would be most welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GOLFpages_LogoOld_4554.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GOLFPAGESLOGO_5353.png]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks, \r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: "I agree that you should go with a fresher-feeling logo to alleviate the potential
    for stuffiness. However, I'm not crazy with the current revision. It does seem
    a bit self-consciously modern, which I'm not sure is ideal for your magazine.
    Also, the combination of the L and F seems awkward, as if the L is stunted, and
    it creates an odd shape that looks like a U with a big top serif that distracts.\r\n\r\nMy
    suggestion would be some sort of slab serif -- different from the norm, and the
    big serifs remind me mildly of clubs. I'd go with a modern interpretation, along
    the lines of <http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/>PMN Caecilia</a>.
    My favorite after a quick search is <http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-micro/>Freight
    Micro, but it's out of your price range. For a logo, though, most would recommend
    that you do something custom, or at least tweak a font significantly."

  body: "Reed - Thanks, I'm not fond of the latest version either. I did try and tell
    my creative director about the 'LF'problem, but I was a bit new then, and he kinda
    didn't really listen. \r\n\r\nJackie - Thankyou also, I've not come across this
    mag before, although It's not quite what i was thinking of with our logo. I don't
    mind offending the readers, I just don't want to alienate them (only joking)The
    photography is much better than ours however as our guy is a mate o the editor
    I believe and none too hot.\r\n\r\nI did have a go with Minion Pro, in bold small
    caps, but my A.D wants something chunkier. I'll post the few ideas i've come up
    with tomorrow when i'm back at work if you'd all be so kind as to comment.\r\n\r\nMuch
    appreciation, \r\n\r\nG\r\n\r\n"
