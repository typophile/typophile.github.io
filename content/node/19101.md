body: "i apologize since this is probably not the place to ask (as it's not truly
  related to fonts), but i don't feel like finding and registering at some illustrator
  forum so here goes..\r\n\r\ni was testing to see all the glyphs in my current typeface
  project in Illustrator CS2 (on PC), but it was replacing the characters \u0192 \u0160
  \u0152 \u0161 \u0153 \u0178 with their Arial counterparts instead of the ones i
  had made. i figured it must've been something wrong with the font, but i can't find
  anything and then i tested other typefaces on my computer and all of them have those
  characters replaced by the Arial counterpart.. what the? in Photoshop, they display
  properly, so this is clearly an Illustrator thing.. has anyone heard of this before?
  is it some bug in the software or may it just be my Illustrator that needs to be
  reinstalled?\r\n\r\nupon further testing it appears it doesn't happen to every single
  font, so for some of them it uses the font's own glyphs and for others it does the
  same as it did with my font.. it doesn't seem to be any Truetype-only or Opentype-only
  thing either.\r\n\r\nany help on the matter would be greatly appreciated."

    and i just uninstalled and reinstalled the program.. but the issue still remains,
    sadly. i can't find any help on it over on Adobe's own forums either.\r\n\r\nugh.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for the reply though."

    i wrote a little message on one of the Adobe forums for Illustrator, so we'll
    see if anyone's got any idea what this is all about.. didn't find anything searching
    though, neither in the forums or the knowledge database so maybe i'm screwed."

    Are the characters still replaced when you generate the font in a different format?\r\n6.
    Which codepages and Unicode ranges does your font support?"

    of my installed fonts, with commercial fonts, homemade ones and free ones.. in
    other programs, even Photoshop, they all work properly.. so this has to be an
    issue with Illustrator, not the fonts. reinstalling didn't work, cutting down
    on fonts didn't work either. how frustrating.. no answers at all on the Adobe
    Forums either.. so much for that.\r\n\r\nanyway, thanks for trying to help."

  body: "No problem. I was trying to figure out if there was a reason why only those
    get replaced.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I see. Seems like something got corrupted with
    Illustrator. Which version, BTW?\r\n\r\nWell, I wish you luck. Let us know what
    the problem was, as soon as you find out. I'm sure one day someone will benefit
    from that.\r\n\r\nPS: Have you tried to remove the Registry entries related to
    Illustrator before re-installing? (Anyway, I would wait for Adobe's feedback,
    before messing around the system even more.)\r\n\r\n[ Edit: Forget the question
    about the version. I just noticed it's on the thread's title :o) ]"

  body: "the curious thing is that all of these characters are close proximity in
    the standard/default encoding.. like in the FontLab template (and the Fontographer
    template). the 255 character set i posted in the earlier post, i think i mapped
    that after the way they appeared in Fontographer.. it's odd because the uppercase
    and lowercase \u0160 and \u0152 are affected, but not the lowercase \u0178 which
    as you see doesn't come until much later in the order. it feels like that's of
    some significance, but i can't figure out why that would be so.\r\n\r\nand just
    for the record i have CS2 v. 12.0.1, which is the very latest as far as i know."

    if anyone has solved this issue. I myself am unable to change out the fonts from
    the \u0153 on through to the \u0192. Very frustrating. I can show Arial (Bold),
