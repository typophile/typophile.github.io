body: "I'm designing a logo right now and wanting to be typographically correct. The
  tag line of the logo is kerned large to fit under the name of the company. There
  is a comma and period in the tag line. Should the comma and period be kerned the
  same amount as the letters?\r\n\r\nHere is my an example of what I'm trying to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nM
  A N A G E M E N T  C O M P A N Y ,  I N C .\r\n\r\nor...\r\n\r\nM A N A G E M E
  N T  C O M P A N Y,  I N C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks."

    at all between words or punctuation, then you should kern them the same as the
    letters (the top example).  This way they don't get lost and aid legibility.\r\n\r\nIs
    there any particular reason why you're not using spaces in the line?"

  body: "Any particular reason why you are including 'Inc'.?\r\n\r\nI understand it's
    the formal name of the company but I'm a big believer in not including 'INC.'
    'LLC', 'LLP', or 'CORPORATION' in logo design. No where does it say you need to
    spell out the full legal name of a company in their mark.\r\n\r\nTake a look at
    Fortune 500 company logos and you never see them. Below are just a few.\r\n\r\nNike,
    Inc.\r\nPepsiCo, Inc.\r\nMcDonald's Corporation\r\nAdobe Systems Incorporated\r\nApple,
    Inc.\r\nYahoo, Inc.\r\nMicrosoft Corporation\r\nIBM Corporation\r\nHewlett-Packard
    Development Company, L.P."

    automatically closes up multiple spaces. If you want to indicate extra spaces
    you'll need to hard-code in a &amp;nbsp; or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't track the punctuation
    as fully as the rest of the caps. But don't have them fitted tight either. They
    shouldn't stand out on their own by having too much space; nor should they cause
    a darkened spot by being unnaturally close in."

  body: "What Jeff said.\r\n\r\nAnd if the company reps won't believe that they are
    allowed to make a logo that doesn't use the official company name, remember that
    you could stick in INC at the end somewhere in a much smaller size, orientation,
    etc. Then you could just drop all the punctuation."

  body: The descriptive inc is dependent on company condition and location. For example,
    the UK equivalent might be ltd or plc. Consequently, if your client anticipates
    that they might change size, or that they might one day operate in new locations,
    or that government regulations might one day be revised - then maybe they are
    obliged to drop the inc from their logo?
