  body: It looks a lot like ITC Avant Garde Gothic w/ Alternates, but I think it's
    either doctored or custom drawn (different 'c', lack of optical correction on
    'r', ...).

  body: That would be Avant Garde, more specifically, I believe Avant Garde Gothic
    with alternates.

  body: Well, if it weren't for the dang bug in the posting mechanism I would've been
    the first. The disappontment is all-consuming. ;-) Besides, Yves' knowledge of
    every glyph in the universe is mind-boggling, and I bow to the master. By the
    way, it looks like three posts happened at the simultaneous moment, and that provides
    some consolation.

    the crossbar of the e is too heavy.\r\nThat\u2019s custom (because it\u2019s so
    ugly)."
