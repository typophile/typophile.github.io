body: "I have a project for billboards, bus and highway, for which I am currently
  using Champion from Hoefler & Frere-Jones. Nice range of compressed to black/extended.
  However, the more I look at it the more I think it is a little too woody. The client
  needs something jazzier. I still need a good range from compressed to extended.
  FB's Bureau Grot is still too woody. Interstate isn't jazzy enough. Armada is too
  tech. Agency is too period-centric.\r\n\r\nIdeas?\r\n\r\nDoesn't have to be from
  Font Bureau, I just happen to have many licenses from them. "

  body: Yep, as I read your initial post Amplitude was the first fam that came to
    mind. Sophisto is great too, but much more mechanical/industrial. Who da client?
    What do you mean by "succinct"?

  body: And what do you mean by "jazzy" :) ? Jazzy as in having charm and sparkle,
    or having that particular Jazz age look?

  body: "I think \"jazzy\" was a poor choice of words. I tried to avoid the word \"trendy,\"
    even though that is what the client should be using. But, if I showed you their
    logo, which I didn't design, you'd understand. The obvious would be to use Helvetica
    as the logo incorporate some black extended. However, the logo also has some Eras.
    Yes! I know!! I suppose I simply want to give a typographic boost to an otherwise
    no-win situation. \r\n\r\nIt is a radio station. Top 40. \r\n\r\nBy succinct I
    mean something with enough variety in widths/weights that I could use a handful
    to cover the bizarre range of dimensions. Perhaps another poorly chosen word."

  body: Both good suggestion, Patty. But, while Knockout is good, I'm trying to move
    away from the wood on this project. I love Gotham, have it, but the condensed
    bold isn't bold enough.
