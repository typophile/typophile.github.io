  working on customs fonts and I may get other jobs in the kind soon. This brings
  me two situations I'm not sure how to manage:\r\n\r\n1. Somebody has designed a
  typeface and hires me (as a freelancer, working in the office and/or at home) to
  perfect the design, complete the character set, space, kern and generate the files.
  In this case, we could say the person created the design of the typeface, the general
  concept, but my work also changed this design.\r\n\r\n2. Somebody hires me (as a
  freelancer) to help on a custom typeface for another client. We work together on
  the design and the production. The exclusive rights to use are then sold to the
  client for a defined duration.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how do we deal with the rights
  on the typeface(s) in each case?\r\nDoes the way I am hired change anything? In-house,
  i guess i would loose any right? What when it's a freelance job, does working home
  or in the office changes anything?\r\nAm I not supposed to get a portion of the
  rights? How can you calculate that?\r\nWhat kind of contract should be made?\r\n\r\nTill
  now I worked mostly on graphic design jobs where rights of use didn't come into
  play.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help and advices!"

    I would speculate that the person you were hired by retains those rights unless
    you had previously otherwise agreed upon this as being a collaborative project.

    been contracts before work ever began. If you want to retain any ownership of
    the designs you need to to discuss this with an experienced attorney immediately
    and get contracts in place. Try contacting other type designers in Switzerland
    to see if they can recommend someone."

    the only thing stopping you from claiming ownership is your relationship with
    the clients, and your reputation amongst the community. '

  body: "Hmmm... yeah i guess what i'm trying to figure out is what are the conventions,
    how does it work usually?\r\nIs it, like Stephen says, that the person who hires
    me has full rights on the typeface, even if, in the end, i'm responsible for 20,
    50 or 90% of the design?\r\n\r\nI should add that, for case 2, I was more thinking
    of a corporate/communication agency (eventually just a graphic designer alone),
    which means there wouldn't be another typedesigner involved. Probably just somebody
    art directing more or less. And this more or less is the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
    for the right path to take on my future works, I understand that on previous works
    it is difficult to reclaim anything without proper contracts and that's not what
    i'm looking for anyway. I just want to be ready and well informed, so I can also
    discuss with future clients.\r\n\r\nOf course in the end the question is also,
    would the client still accept if I was to reclaim rights from the beginning. But
    if this is standard line in the industry, i guess it'd make the negotiation easier."

  body: "In case 1, I would consider that work for hire, and wouldn't expect a design
    credit or a share of rights, unless a share of rights were agreed as payment.
    In a case like this, it is a good idea to establish, in a written agreement, what
    kind of credit you may take for your involvement in the project. I have done work
    for some people who prefer that my involvement in the project remain confidential,
    and for other people who are happy for me to include mention of the work in a
    CV or portfolio.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm the person hiring, rather than being hired, I'll
    give a design credit if the associate designer has significantly contributed to
    the overall look of the typeface. I never have any objection to associate designers
    including mention of work for me in portfolios etc. so long as the level of involvement
    is accurately represented.\r\n\r\nIn case 2, as you describe it, I would say that
    you definitely deserve a design credit, but not all customers will want to give
    it to you. Whether you have a share in the rights, though, is a contractual matter,
    and not one of right. The other designer may view your involvement as work for
    hire."

  body: "As John points out, \"credit\" and \"rights\" are two different things. You
    may be entitled to claim credit for anything that you've worked on (in relevant
    proportion, of course). But rights, as in copyrights or other intellectual property
    rights under the law, will be governed by applicable statutes. \r\n\r\nWhat constitutes
    \"work for hire\" (especially in the absence of any explicit contractual arrangement)
    may differ in different jurisdictions. You should consult someone versed in Swiss
    intellectual property law.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ok, thank you.\r\nActually I'm working mostly in Germany now.\r\n\r\nWhat
    i find a bit bizarre here, is: what is stopping corporate agencies to hire typedesigners
    on a freelance basis instead of ordering a typeface, so that they can claim the
    rights over it? Of course Typedesigners could refuse and say they don't work that
    way, but is that really the issue? In the end, the working process may be very
    similar."

  body: "Thanks for the link. Interesting reading. It somehow confirms my thinking,
    which is that, if you work as a freelancer, without a contract stating otherwise,
    you remain the author of your creations. I imagine this would be quite easy to
    prove in a court, where you'd have all the files on your computer, probably sketches,
    prints, emails, etc...\r\n\r\nIn Europe, I doubt being  an employee is enough
    to loose ownership, but this is done through the employment contract. I may be
    wrong tho, and I should get some proper legal expertise.\r\n\r\nI must add that,
    in my experience at least in Switzerland and Germany, few graphic designers make
    \"physical\" contracts with their clients, unless a lot of money is involved.
    Till now, all my freelance jobs where dealt without contracts."

  body: "x-y, same here, most work I undertake is without contracts.\r\n\r\nCase 1\r\n\r\nI'd
    expect to get a credit but no rights. Here your expertise has been called in but
    it is somebody else's initiative and they are hiring you for your technical skill.
    It's quite common to see somebody else credited for help with italics for example.
    The more you have changed the design, the more prominent you might expect this
    credit to become. You may get a credit for mastering the font.\r\n\r\nCase 2\r\n\r\nI
    think this is more confusing. When I go to work in a studio as a freelancer I
    don't expect to retain the rights to anything that I do. I think this is part
    perception and part the nature of the work. Usually I am working under somebody's
    direction, I am there to make up the numbers in the studio and to get work completed
    - it is as if I am in-house staff for that day, week or month. If I was to work
    directly for a client I would probably expect to retain more rights as I would
    have the opportunity to negotiate a contract with them directly.\r\n\r\nFeel free
    to contend, I'm inexperienced at the business side of things."

  body: "Yeah case 2 is really complicated to handle i think. As a graphic designer,
    i also don't expect getting the rights of my works. But with type design, I really
    think every case may be different. If it is just about help (correcting some glyphs,
    completing the character set) or technical work (spacing, kerning), then it's
    fine for me if I don't get any right.\r\nBut as soon as it's more than that, I
    would expect getting at least part of the rights.\r\n\r\nWorking freelance is
    very different to working inhouse. Inhouse, the company pays social charges, offers
    some relative professional security, and, at least in Switzerland, if you get
    fired, you can reclaim money from the state as unemployed. As a freelancer, there
    is no unemployed situation so the state does not support you if you don't have
    clients for one month. You have to pay for your retreat, for your material, etc...\r\nFor
    this reason, I would expect getting partial rights when i'm a partial designer,
    or total rights if I'm the real author."
