  am currently trying to draw an E to match this T (for a top-secret logotype). The
  bodies of the letter forms are based on Engravers Boldface  but I have been changing
  the serifs and adding a thick crossbar at the top. The thick crossbar is part of
  the design concept. So, what I can't figure out is how that thickness should be
  interpreted in the middle and lower arms of the E.\r\n\r\nI would love some advice.\r\nSorry
  for being a novice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dandd/8afdbac818f0ba67ac95911e3614b93de5fd261d.gif\"

  The serifs are inspired by what's going on here in Commercial Type's Giorgio."

  body: Hey Alex. The Giorgio E is a good reference point for what you're trying to
    do. You'll want to take note of the relationship between the stroke width of the
    serifs and the overall height of the letter within the context of the stem, crossbar,
    and arms. At the height you're drawing it, the serifs don't appear fine at all.
    Thin them out some. Experiment with thinner arms (and a thinner crossbar on the
    T). For further guidance, study the shape made by the negative space where the
    inner serifs of the E interact. Let us see how it goes.

  body: "Hey David,\r\n\r\nThis is enormously helpful, but I'm already pretty happy
    with the weight of the serifs. I'm not looking to emulate the drama of the Giorgio
    character...just the overall shape. This logo will appear on the internet in very
    small sizes, so fine serifs like that\u2014while they are gorgeous\u2014 are pretty
    much out of the question.\r\n\r\nMy question is a lot more focused. I am really
    very happy with the T, and I am trying to draw a complimentary E. I would love
    your advice on that!! \r\n\r\nps. I edited my original post to clarify."

  body: "I think your E works.\r\nSince it is for a logo, it shold be seen alongside
    all the letters involved. But since the logo is top secret, the general advice
    I can give is that, since E is busier than T, horizontal strokes could (should)
    be a little lighter than the one of T."

  body: "Not sure if you're still checking this thread, but I've posted an amended
    E below with a couple of minor tweaks. Hope you don't mind me posting the image,
    describing my suggested changes was getting very confusing! \r\n\r\nEssentially
    I've shortened the serifs on both the upper and lower horizontal strokes, and
    also shortened the length of the upper horizontal stroke, so that its serif appears
    to sit slightly within the serif on the lower horizontal stroke. Hope that's clear!
    I've placed my tweaked E on top of your original one so you can, hopefully, see
    what's changed. If you take a close look at the Giorgio E you posted you'll see
    that its upper horizontal stroke does the same thing, but it's very subtle.\r\n\r\nI
    made these changes pretty quickly, so if you feel they're worth doing then you
    might want to take a bit more time over them than I did. Hope that helps.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e0d799d438b47116be59536d5b007e41c24a6e58_6568.jpg]"
