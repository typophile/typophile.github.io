  \r\nI have not really found very many good examples.\r\n\r\nI am trying to solve
  the problem with:\r\n\r\na)\r\nmany ligatures\r\n\r\nb)\r\ncreating alternates for
  the following kind of connections:\r\n\"high\"(example: o n), \r\n\"medium\" (example:
  n n), \r\n\"low\"(example: y n),\r\n\"no\" (example: any pair disconnected on purpose)
  \r\n\r\nIt works quite well (with some flaws).\r\nI would like to go a bit into
  detail on this with someone else working on the problem.\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I just completed an antique handwriting font that is connecting. Its always
    tough making some connections work, though probably easier on letters that are
    textural. The one I'm currently working on is based on smooth pointed brush lettering.
    \ Many letters vary in size and so making all the connections line up and look
    natural is more difficult. Letters that connect towards the top are the most difficult
    and often benefit from ligatures as you said. \r\n\r\nOne thing I've also tried
    is putting connectors on the left side of some letters and creating a version
    without these for beginnings and next to letters that don't connect. If you want
    the letters to look more close to a natural flow of writing, its good to make
    places that purposely don't connect. In handwriting there are always places where
    the writer lifts the pen. It helps visually to break up the connecting pattern
    a bit. Open type feature code is great for getting this all to work. I will see
    if I can post an image.\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp\r\n\r\nhttp://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2320736839_d826e10b25.jpg?v=0\r\n"

  body: "Your example is very nice. I agree that there should be places which purposely
    are not connected. \r\nBut it's hard to create the right dosage - so these work
    well in different kinds of texts and in different languages. Here is an example
    of what we are working on - sample text in English and Spanish...(some other languages
    we tested are a bit more problematic).\r\nCould you comment?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Engl_spanish2_5697.jpg]"

  body: "Monoline handwriting does present some challenges. I think most of your connections
    are working smoothly. I like the loose quality of it. There are some things that
    could be done to improve its legibility\u2014 depending on how well you want it
    to read. \r\nI'll make some observations, but since I don't know the background
    on the font's development or how you see it being used, these may not all be relevant.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"o\" that is looped \"antropog\xE9nica\" seems less natural as might be written.
    It does read ok in that combination. Since I don't read Spanish the other one
    I wasn't sure was an \"o\" or an \"s\" with a loop (especula?).\r\n\r\nSome of
    the connections come out a bit flat at the bottom, but at small sizes its not
    a big issue. \r\n\r\nIn general, I like the look and feel of the lettering a lot,
    but think some simplification might improve it both in looks and legibility. \r\n\r\nThe
    cap \"I\" connection seems like it might be confusing in some combinations. \r\n\r\nThe
    long heavy crosses on many of the lowercase t's seem isolated and catch my eye
    too much. \r\n\r\nI love the simpler letters like the basis  s i e n h, etc.\r\n\r\n\"p\"
    as in \"pounds\" has a right bowl to similar to an \"n\". \r\n\r\nI also think
    the start loop on lowercase \"c\"s might be a bit over done. In some places it
    can read like an \"e\". It seems rhythmically out of character a bit too.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the lowercase \"d\"s are so seperated from the ascending stroke that you might
    have situations where it reads as cl.\r\n\r\nI know that seems like a lot of comments,
    but even so, I think your design will be a lovely and useful font.\r\nHope this
    is helpful.\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp"

  body: "Hi Stephen, \r\n\r\nand thanks for remarks, they  give a lot to think about.
    \r\nA few words about the font: It's inspired by Kafka's handwriting which is
    extremely rich in its variation of forms ... you seem to be able to recognize
    the moods he was in when writing. The most \"exotic\" forms like in the c, d,
    p, t and some of the strange connections between caps and following characters
    are authentically Kafka, and, although they hamper legibility, we find it important
    to keep them, because they add so much to the overall feeling. \r\nNow we are
    thinking of adding a second style focussing more on readability and consistency
    of form, and there your comments will be very helpful.\r\nYou are surely right
    that some of the connections on the \"baseline\" are too flat ... we have to do
    something there too.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\nJurgen "
