    I would bet you have it on your computer already.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    from Neue:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helvetica-vs-Helvetica-Neue_3900.png]\r\nBoth
    are the Linotype versions that ship with Mac OS."

  body: Thank you for that distinction, I have this font on my system, Helvetiker,
    it looks like the Alte, I would still like a copy of the Neue, if it is available
    on the systems, why do we need to buy it?

  body: "If you run Mac OS, Apple has already licensed it from Linotype for you. If
    you don't, you'll have to license it from Linotype (or someone else with another
    cut) yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd FWIW, \"Helvetiker\" sounds like a cheap knock off...
    letter forms may be copied but the rest of the font may be junk."

  body: "That is what I figured, I am running Windows 7, so no Helvetika! Thank you
    so much for the info, I have a question on other system fonts you might be able
    to help me with. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of very odd looking fonts on my system,
    when I look in the font file on Windows 7 they look like very strange foreign
    languages I have never even heard of, like Shruti, etc, can I delete these to
    make room for the fonts I do use, I can't ever see a need for basic English speaking
    computer work to need these fonts, thanks, Carin"

  body: "Helvetica spelled with a K is incorrect. The mythology around Helvetica's
    nazi roots and the so-called \"german spelling\" has been explored <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/32405\">here
    on typophile</a>. I wrote about its <a href=\"http://starwarsmodern.blogspot.com/2010/03/helvetica-is-not-fascist-font.html\">misidentified
    fascist history</a> in the spring, and mention this as well. \r\n\r\nOh Suzy Rice,
    who let you in the party?\r\n\r\nDon't know much, myself, about Windows 7 or its
    typographic platform. I know MS introduced a slew of nicely designed albeit sort
    of bland new fonts with either Vista or 7, but it's all fuzzy to me. There are,
    however, lots of folks on here who could probably answer this."
