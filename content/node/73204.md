    Knockout #50 \"Welterweight\" was the closest match. And it could well be the
    same, but it would have been altered. The Smoking Loon is a just a tad lighter
    and more condensed. But I realize I am splitting hairs here. I think the designer
    may have added a stroke."

    think Trade Gothic is a teeeny bit closer. I think the difference is most noticeable
    in the spine of the \"N\"."
