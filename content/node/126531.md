  Caps in Indesign or Illustrator, it just puts the fake small caps instead the real
  ones, but the real ones exist in glyphs and I can add them into text when putting
  glyph by glyph.\r\nAny ideas how to make the ID or AI use the real Small Caps instead
  the fake.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the screenshot where you can select the small caps, right? I assume you tried
    the one in the OpenType sub menu and not the one that is two items down from it?
    OK, in that case the font you are using is missing the OpenType feature cod, which
    should substitutes caps to small caps or turn everything into small caps. Call
    the foundry and ask them for support.\r\n"
