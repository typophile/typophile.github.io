  you know if it's used in any company logo? Because it reminds me something... but
  i can't find out which one!\r\n\r\nThank you very much."

  body: "Im pretty sure there are many logotypes using Triplex out there, but maybe
    not any big brand since Triplex Serif retains a strong 90's vibe. Check out this:\r\n\r\nhttp://content.corkd.com/about/\r\n\r\nIs
    that your question?\r\n\r\nTriplex is an interesting family since the sans and
    the serif were designed after the italic face and somehow made to match. The italic
    face is very true to the humanist model and works wonderfully in books. The sans
    and serif faces were designed after a bitmap grid model. I used the triplex family
    to design a book about indigenous recipes once.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    of the (many) things I love about Triplex is that the roman and italic were designed
    by two different people: Zuzana Licko did the roman (and slab serif); John Downer
    did the ital that inspired her.  Just like the days before romans with matching
    italics.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else think the OT versions of the faces seem to have
    been revised?  They seem different from the PostScript 1 originals, but maybe
    that's just me."

    for it. Downer's is\r\nindeed inspiring (and it features probably my\r\nall-time
    favorite ampersand).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure I understand your point, Hrant.  As H\xE9ctor points out, Downer's
    italic was designed well before Licko's roman\u2014four years before, in fact.
    \ So I'm not sure how he could have been helping her out of a jam by providing
    an italic version of a face she had yet to design.  What am I missing?  \r\n\r\nBut
    I certainly agree that he created one of the most memorable italics of the last
    few decades.  "

  body: "No, I didn't mean that he planned it that way.\r\nHis design didn't have
    a Roman (which might\r\nbe why it wasn't released) and she needed a\r\ngood Italic,
    and the styles clicked, so... BTW\r\nare you sure she designed the Roman based
    on\r\nseeing the Italic? That's not what I remember.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to bear this out\u2014that the italic was released on its own in 1985, four years
    before the rest of the family."

  body: "OK, I just checked the site, and actually it\r\nseems to support what I said,
    except that:\r\n- Downer's original design apparently did have\r\na Roman; the
    two got separated due to a request\r\nby a (potential?) customer.\r\n- There's
    nothing about Licko having trouble\r\nmaking an italic herself; I remember that
    from\r\nanother source - possibly even a previous version\r\nof the \"Design Info\"
    on the Emigre site itself, or\r\nmaybe an interview, or a post by Downer to a\r\ndiscussion
    group.\r\n\r\nBTW, was Triplex Serif a later addition?\r\nI seem to remember something
    like that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
