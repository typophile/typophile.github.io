  sans-serif/regular and oblique typeface within Adobe Illustrator which I am quiete
  familiar with.\r\n\r\n2. I downloaded a Demo-Version of FontLab5 to get myself familiar
  with the next level, go from designing the letterforms to actually \"making\" a
  font out of them. \r\n\r\n3. My question is: how is it possible to set multiple
  charactes per glyph for an OpenType-font within FonLab?\r\n\r\nFor example if I
  have two or maybe three different forms for an \"N\" character I want to have those
  accessible from within a sophisticated glyph table menu as it can be found in Adobe-applications
  like Illustrator or InDesign.\r\n\r\nI think i read that it is very possible to
  set up six characters per glyph. I just can not figure out how to do so within Fontlab.\r\n\r\nSome
  hint or short advise from anyone would be greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\nVery best,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteffen!\r\n\r\n"

    experience already, and so i'll jump right in:\r\n\r\n<em>My question is: how
    is it possible to set multiple charactes per glyph for an OpenType-font within
    FonLab?</em>\r\n\r\nThis depends. you can put all six glyphs in different features.
    If it's a smallcap version of the glyph, put it in the smcp feature. If it's a
    swash variant, put it in the swsh or cswh features. If it's a titling alternate,
    put it in the titl feature. &c...\r\nOr, if you just want to put all six in say
    the stylistic alternates feature to be accessed by the glyph pallette, you can
    use this structure:\r\n\r\nsub n from [n.salt n.slt2 n.slt3 n.slt4 n.slt5 n.slt6];\r\n\r\nThis
    works best in the stylistic alternates (salt) feature, however none but the first
    alternate will be automatically substituted and only in some programs if you use
    the salt feature.\r\n\r\n<em>I think i read that it is very possible to set up
    six characters per glyph. I just can not figure out how to do so within Fontlab.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    didn't realise there was a limit. Can anyone confirm or disprove this statement?"

    I never did it before, this is my very first attempt.\r\n\r\nI rather have an
    ok understanding of the environment I\xB4m putting myself into and a good ability
    to adept quickly to new situations..\r\n\r\nI \"use\" FontLab for some days and
    so far I\xB4m doing quiete well, I think. I\xB4m able to get my characters from
    Illustrator to FontLab easily, I understand how to set the size and the nullpoint
    correct within one easy step using an \"action\" I set up in Illustrator. I also
    use the \"edit kerning\" feauture for extra kerning aspects and needs.\r\n\r\nThe
    current beast for me is to set up alternates.\r\n\r\n\"sub n from [n.salt n.slt2

    everything works fine now, though I do not yet understand how to use the \"ss01-ssXX\u201D\"
    features; the \"salt\" substitution work fine, but how to use multiple glyphs
    (meaning more than one)per character I do not yet understand.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks

  body: "I'm not sure if this part has been answered for you yet--how and/or where
    to put the extra glyphs in the font.\r\n\r\nHere are two methods.\r\n\r\nMethod
    1. Let's say you want to make an alternate N. Select the N in the Font window.
    Choose Copy from the Edit menu. Right click (or control click) on the Font window
    to get the contextual pop-up menu. Select Append from the pop-up menu. A copy
    of the N, called N.001, will appear at the end of the font. You can keep this
    name or rename it something like N.alt1. \r\n\r\nMethod 2. Again, let's say you
    want to make an alternate N. Choose \"Generate Glyphs...\" from the Glyph menu.
    Type the name you want to use, e.g. N.alt1, and click OK. A copy of the N glyph
    (with the name you gave it) will appear at the end of the font. \r\n\r\nIn both
    of these cases, the name you give it (e.g., N.alt1) is the name you use when writing
    your salt or ss01, ss02, etc. features when referring to the alternate N. \r\n\r\nNow
    you can modify the artwork in the copy for your alternate glyph, paste your Illustrator
    art for the alternate N here, or delete the art and draw a new N from scratch.\r\n"

  body: "Assume you have 3 a's, 4 b's and 2 c's. You'd have the glyphs: \r\n\r\na
    a.1 a.2 b b.1 b.2 b.3 c c.1\r\n\r\nThe features would be: \r\n\r\nfeature salt
    {\r\n  sub a from [a.1 a.2]; \r\n  sub b from [b.1 b.2 b.3]; \r\n  sub c from
    [c.1]; \r\n} salt; \r\n\r\nfeature ss01 { \r\n  sub a by a.1; \r\n  sub b by b.1;

    \r\n\r\nIf your glyphs are a bit swashy, I'd also add: \r\n\r\nfeature swsh {\r\n
    \ sub a from [a.2]; \r\n  sub b from [b.2 b.3]; \r\n} swsh; \r\n\r\nIn Illustrator,
    there are separate toggles for salt and swsh, so you could get to the 1st alternate
    by salt and to the 2nd alternate by swsh. In InDesign CS2, there is access to
    the ssXX features so you could access to all the glyphs that way. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    I followed all the steps suggested by twardoch and it seems all right, meaning
    I got no more errors. I generated the font but it does not do what I intended.
    That is: everytime you type a particular letter for the second or third time I
    want them different. I made 3 versions of every small cap letter and 2 versions
    of the capital letters.\r\nEx: in the word \"tomorrow\", I would like the three
    \"o\"s and the two \"r\"s to be diferent in the same word. \r\n\r\nPlease help!"
