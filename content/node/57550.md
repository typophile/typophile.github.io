  to be a service that is easy to plug into my existing web site with simple hyperlinks
  or cutting/pasting code. I don\u2019t want to manage the payment system myself because
  I don\u2019t want to be responsible for handling credit card information. Does anyone
  have a suggestion?"

  body: Paypal comes to mind - but it is Paypal, like most "solutions", it has it's
    issues and there seems to be some folks with an irrational hatred of Paypal (due
    to early incidents of spoofing and account hijacking). Let us know what you decide
    to run with as I'm interested in what's out there too.

    card information\r\n\r\nFor this you don't need to use \"hosted payment pages\"
    (which is what you are effectively asking for), all you need is a hook-up to a
    \"payment gateway\". It allows you to keep customers entirely on your site, but
    forward CC authorization to a third party. And if you do not store CC numbers
    anywhere on your server, you are in the clear in terms of PCI compliance (which
    is the \"being responsible for handling cc information\" part).\r\n\r\nBy processing
    the cards yourself (and compared to hosted option) you'll be saving about 1% of
    commission and 10c or more in fixed fees per transaction. Something to think about
    I guess.\r\n"

  body: Who is your host? Most of them have a service built into the server that your
    website is already sitting on. I would highly recommend that you contact your
    service provider and ask them their opinions based on their experience with the
    services used by people sharing the same system as you.

    I use it myself.\r\nThey work through paypal, and automatically send the appropriate
    files upon completed payment. They can handle expiring download links (and reactivation),
    product variations, product packages. They're really good!\r\n\r\n(and, no, they
    don't pay me to write this :) )"
