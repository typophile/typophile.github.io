body: "This is a scan from a book printed in 1971 in Hong Kong. Time, place and look
  would tell me it's hot metal and very probably a british typeface, but of course
  it's not Times (would be too easy). It's similar to Times, but especially in the
  italic there are alot of differences (the 'p' or the counter in the 'w' for example).
  the italic seems to have similarities to faces like adobe caslon.\r\n\r\nany idea
  which digital font may fit this the best? i'm open to use different typefaces for
  italic and roman/bold, so similar digital fonts of either of those would be interesting
  too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/learncantonese_4842.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/learncantonese2_4000.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks!"
