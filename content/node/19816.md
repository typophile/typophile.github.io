  body: "Aw, I was late!\r\n\r\nHmm there seems to be minute differences between Trump
    Mediaeval and Kuenstler 480, the foot serifs are different - angled vs. slab.
    Your sample is very blurry, it's hard to say which one it is."

  body: Ya know, I knew the font looked familiar but I couldn't finger it so I did
    whatthefont and it turned up that Kuenstler font. But I must have been thinking
    of Trump Mediaeval. It actually looks more like Kuenstler tho, with the slab serifs.

    not so sure, one minute I am sure it's Trump, the next minute Kuenstler. You know
    how blurring usually averages out the forms but if you look at the foot serifs
    of that n, it does look angled? "
