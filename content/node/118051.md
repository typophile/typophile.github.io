  there any easy way of doing this across the whole font at once, without having to
  move each one individually?"

  body: Judging from the length of your instructions they seem to have hidden that
    function well. It's good to know where it is, for future reference.

    body: "Yes, they certainly did hide it.\r\nI also found lots of other useful ACTIONS
      in there as well, like EFFECTS > PARALLEL.\r\nWhich lets you thin out or widen
      on one, or both axis.\r\nYou can also do multiple actions at once.\r\nSo you
      can make your font bold on both axis (parallel), reduce size (scale), then shift
      it to it's position.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen shot 2014-07-19

      the spacing all at once,\r\nmay be another member has a better suggestion?\r\n"
