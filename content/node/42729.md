  http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/identikal/revalo_classic/ family in a magazine,
  when i bring the word file into indesign it ditches all the italic formatting.\r\nI
  have no idea how to fix this so it all comes through and i know where the italics
  are. Am i doing something wrong in my stylesheets? if anyone can help that would
  be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    file using a different face and get the italics?

    Italic to Revalo Classic Whatever Italic. Try using a font that works when you
    bring the text in, set up styles, and then change the styles working styles to
    Revalo."

  body: "That's how I do it:\r\n\r\nAfter importing Word file (see screen-capture)
    into InDesign and BEFORE any formatting I find/change (cmd/ctrl +F) any instance
    of italic/bold/bold italic (Find format settings => Format => Basic character
    formats => font style) and change it to relevant character style (defined berofe).
    Then I apply paragraph styles and all formatting from Word file are preserved.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/word_import_3522.gif]\r\n\r\n"

    want to lose the italics, don't hold the option key when you click on the style
    in the palette. "
