    it cannot work this way. In your example \u201CA V\u201D, you are correct, it
    might benefit from adjusted spacing, but that is cause by the combination of A
    and V itself, not by the letters standing with a space. You cannot solve this
    problem by kerning SPACE and V and A and SPACE. Because those 2 single kern pairs
    don't know the other letter involved. Should the first letter change, than the
    kerning of SPACE and V would be wrong again. \r\nYou would need to take all 3
    letters into account, which is hardly possible considering all the letters that
    can stand on each side of the space. "

    in words becoming too close (and too loose doesn't harm readability nearly as
    much as too tight, at least in terms of wordspace). But I wonder, what about kerning
    something like \"f\"-[space] <em>positively</em>? For a really... well-endowed
    \"f\" that might be good.\r\n\r\nA more sophisticated solution though is kerning

    for letters like A and V. If those are well-spaced to begin with, then the visual
    impact on word spacing isn't very great. But an f that extends a long way into
    the word space will come very close indeed to a following cap or ascender, especially
    a T.\r\n\r\nThis (above) is the f-to-space kerning in Brill Roman, with the same
    sequence without kerning below. The value here is +45/1000  units.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ralf_6726.png]"

    top is as the font works now, with a shorter nosed f substituted and the space-T

    is the long-nosed f and no kerning on space-T. \r\n\r\nI think this works better
    than just kerning out the f-space combination. But I don't think the whole issue

  body: "I wasn't going to comment, but...\r\n\r\nYou need to be very careful kerning
    anything with a space. It is a slippery slope, and easy to get in trouble.\r\n\r\nI've
    used this example before on Typophile. Take Adobe Jensen. Set f_wordspace_quotedbleleft_a\r\n\r\nThe
    wordspace just vanishes  -- esp if you fill out the words, like \r\n\r\n...variance
    of \"allowed\" tolerances...\r\n\r\nHugh Ambrose's book, <cite>The Pacific</cite>,
    is full of these. The cause of this problem with Jensen isn't so much the \"f\"
    but the kerning of the quotes back into the wordspace. The two kerns in concert
    kill the wordspace.\r\n\r\nIf you want to kern an f with a wordspace, be sure
    to test it when followed by a few capitals -- capital J is usually the worst,
    as in \"of Jewish origin.\"  Some lower-case letters can give problems, too (b,h,i,j,k,l),
    as well as the left quotes.\r\n\r\nI prefer to create a special f, where, when
    followed by a wordspace, the flag (nose) of the f is shorter, and the sidebearing
    a bit greater -- though I suppose increasing the sidebearing is the same as using
    a blanket kern. I believe this is what Bill showed with his Caslon. With OpenType,
    a calt substitution can make its use automatic.\r\n\r\nAs others have said, the
    real answer, in so far as there is one,  comes from the design and spacing of
    all the letters, and the compromises they occasion. Pairs kerning offers only
    limited help. You have to set it up for the worst case. Contextual kerning can
    improve greatly on that.\r\n\r\nHere is the mental model I use for contextual
    kerning. Back in the days of hand-set type and the composing stick, you set the
    line, then added more space to the word spaces to drive the line out to full measure.
    If a particular space was optically larger, you just didn't add as much space
    there. \r\n\r\nThe problem with machine set type, esp. computers, is that adding
    equal space to drive out the line is automatically applied everywhere. The \"programmatic
    handwork\" then, comes in taking out space -- kerning. Essentially, that requires
    triplets. For example, c_space_w usually requires less space than h_space_n. for
    optically even spacing. Etc.\r\n\r\nIf you can put this in the font and your layout
    program supports it, fine. Otherwise, easy enough to write a script to put the
    kerns in with a layout program -- InDesign, TeX, whatever. If you use regular
    expressions, you can get quite close to the thinking/approach of class-based kerning.
    We've done this in our shop since the late 1980s, when we drove a photocomp machine
    (Linotron-202) with TeX. \r\n\r\nBut for kerning between just two letters, don't
    go beyond what the worst situation allows when you add that third letter -- e.g.,
    \ f_space_J, f_space_quoteleft, etc.\r\n"

  body: "Bill, Charles, I've opined this before, and I still think making the \"f\"
    more modest (compromising the bouma) before a space is backwards: the beak of
    the \"f\" (the only worthwhile ascender in the Latin alphabet) is kept at bay
    mostly to avoid a collision, and the blank space totally eliminates that problem.
    So -assuming you're not getting into kerning <em>triplets</em>- I think kerning
    the \"f\" positively with the space is generally the best compromise; I might
    even contextually make the beak <em>bigger</em>. Remember, too much space isn't
    nearly as bad as too little.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, effectively substituting different f's depending on the triplet amounts
    to triple kerning. I used three different terminal f's. The regular terminal was
    this with the shortened nose (red-terminal, black-regular) : \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f_reg_and_f_5281.dbl.gif]\r\n\r\nand
    one alternative was this, same side bearings with a longer bar to the right:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f_reg_and_f_terminal_4850.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
    then there was another one like the above, but with wider side bearings on the
    right. I substituted one of the three using CALT  depending what seemed to work
    best with the triplet. "
