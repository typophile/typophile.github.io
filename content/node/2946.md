  body: The bold font could be <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205098">Egiziano</a>
    or Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=Giza">Giza</a>.
    The other one looks like Hellenic Wide to me, too. I used it on the TypeCon logo
    last year. I don&#39;t know of any digital versions of it. &#40;I scanned and
    traced the characters I needed from an old type specimen book.&#41;

    Eduardo linked above, I mentioned that a version of Hellenic Wide re-named &#34;Hefty&#34;
    by FontBank is still available, and gave a link to a site where you can get it
    for $2.

    can.

    it, which  <BR>makes it look like Alberto&#39;s on drugs or something. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Alberto, I guess you clicked &#34;Yes&#34; when
    your browser  <BR>asked you &#34;Remember the values you filled in?&#34; when  <BR>you
    created your previous thread. Unfortunately the  <BR>browser doesn&#39;t only
    remember your Username and  <BR>Password &#40;nifty!&#41; but also the Subject
    line &#40;annoying!&#41;.  <BR>This means with every new thread you create it
    will  <BR>automatically fill in that same subject line &#34;Eric Gill book  <BR>font&#34;.
    Even worse, even if you change it to whatever it  <BR>needs to be, it will change
    back when you hit Preview/ <BR>Post Message, so you&#39;ll have to retype it again.
    I had  <BR>the same thing once, and frankly I can&#39;t remember how  <BR>I got
    rid of it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

  body: BTW If your sample is more than 10 years old it&#39;s probably  <BR>Vincent
    Figgins&#39; <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205098" target="_blank">
    Egiziano</a>. The fact that it&#39;s paired with  <BR>Hellenic Wide makes me think
    it might very well be.
