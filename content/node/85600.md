  body: Try Engravers' Gothic, for the first three lines. Looks like the original
    was printed on letterpress, pick-up type, from the lack of kerning, so if you
    want to be authentic, I suggest turning off kerning if reproducing digitally.
    URL looks like Helvetica.

  body: "I think Sackers Gothic might be a better match than Engravers Gothic (look
    at the spine of the \"2\", and the sheared nose of the \"4\"). Also, if you look
    at Sackers here http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sackers-gothic/ it doesn't seem
    to <em>have</em> [tighter] kerning in \"Yo\", or \"Pa\". \r\n(Ben: These have
    the same source as Copperplate AFAIK, just no serifs.)"

    of the letters :)
