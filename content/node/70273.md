  winners in the WinSoft Arabic Typography Contest, which were announced at the Adobe
  Beach Bash May 8 in Dubai.\r\n\r\nThe WinSoft Arabic Typography Contest invited
  contestants to illustrate, in text, their vision of a world where a dialogue between
  cultures is both natural and enriching. The theme of the contest was collaboration
  and communication, inline with UNESCO\u2019s theme for 2010, the Rapprochement Between
  Cultures. Contestants needed to use InDesign ME, Tasmeem and at least one Tasmeem
  font to create their design, and the designs needed to respect the theme of the
  contest. We were delighted to see the wide diversity of styles in the more than
  70 designs submitted.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Winners...</strong>\r\n\r\nFirst place
  was awarded to Dareen and Habib Khoury for their work \"World Cultures Interaction\".
  They described the design as \"The word Rapprochement in 27 different languages
  ... With image of several hands in a circular movement that symbolizes the interaction
  between world cultures and nations which also depicts the desire to live peaceful
  coexistence. The texts over elaborate the truth behind a mutual respect for human
  dignity and the protection of morals, as an entrance to the dialogue and interaction
  between civilizations.\"\r\n\r\nSecond place was awarded to Farhan Naseer for his
  piece titled \"Love for All, Hatred for None\", described as using \"a Sakun/Jazm
  as a symbol to represent coming together, as this is what this symbol does in writing,
  it joins letters.\"\r\n\r\nThird place was awarded to Samar Maakaron for her design
  \"The Corniche Series 02\". She said about her work: \"In this poster, I attempt
  to explain the Arabic expressions (...), the contexts in which they reside, and
  how they nuance the basis differences between East and West.\"\r\n\r\nYou may see
