  body: "I am forming the opinion that perhaps the logotype is a customization of
    a geometric sans, like Futura or the House Chalet family. The terminals could
    have been edited and even that j might have been made from a Futura-like g with
    the bowl removed. The 't' could have been edited, and so on. If it's an off-the-shelf
    font it has an odd mix of letterforms, because the w is out of character with
    the n and u, and the s seems like a conventional sans s that seems out of place
    with some of the other letters (to me). \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks for digging in to this. I got the impression that
    the letters were not entirely balanced indeed, as you write. Could very well be
    a customization. I do not know the person that provided the logo's, but what I
    heard is that it usually took a long time to to create them. That's probably the
    reason then.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nPaul"
