  body: Paul, you might write Stathmore Paper about getting a watermark into paper.
    Its part of the paper making process.

  body: Depends what you mean by &#34;vellum.&#34; <BR> <BR>A watermark is created
    by embedding a relief design on the screen used to form the paper. The paper is
    thus slightly thinner where the design is and that creates the watermark that
    you see when you hold the paper up to the light.  <BR> <BR>Technically speaking,
    vellum is calfskin -- so no possibility for a watermark. <BR> <BR>But vellum is
    often used today to mean a mottled paper that is made to resemble traditional
    vellum parchment. In that case, a custom watermark might be possible, but most
    parchment stocks don&#39;t usually come with a watermark. That would destroy the
    illusion that the paper is vellum, wouldn&#39;t it. <BR> <BR>Vellum is also used
    to describe a paper finish, usually as opposed to Smooth. Similar surfaces are
    Antique and Wove. The distinctions between antique, vellum, and wove are often
    slight and vary by mill. This kind of vellum paper frequently has a watermark,
    depending upon the maker and the quality of the paper and its purpose &#40;usually
    papers for stationary get a watermark, while those for books do not, for instance&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Strathmore offers a program for creating custom watermarks, but the minimum
    order is obviously large. Other paper mills may also provide this service. <BR>

  body: You might think of letterpress. Impression no ink. Or impression varnish.
    Still this is not a watermark. <BR> <BR>I invented an interesting process for
    making artificial watermarks using water soluable light sensitive chemicals. You
    would print with kiss impression and expose automatically with light. Only problem
    was you had to wear gloves unless you wanted a sunburn. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t
    want one. <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>They are researching the old Icelandic manuscripts. <BR> <BR>&#39;But
    it&#39;s a danish email&#39;  You might argue, well, that&#39;s because we weren&#39;t
    very nice to the Icelandic people and among all the c&#42;&#42;&#42; we did to
    them, we stole the entire collection, we didn&#39;t give it back until &#39;93
    or something. <BR>But these people may know a thing or two about vellum.'

  body: well i guess it isn&#39;t real vellum, just a kind of transparent-ish paper
    that a lot of people call vellum, to me it has a kind of plasticky feel. and i
    guess i don&#39;t want a real watermark either, i just want to &#34;etch&#34;
    &#40;for lack of a better word&#41; an image into the stock. My brother-in-law
    swears that lemon juice will do the trick &#40;and he DOES know everything&#41;
    but i&#39;m kinda skeptical. so i thougt i&#39;d ask the experts...
