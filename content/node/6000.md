  body: Nick, <BR>  Wow! Thanks! It figures that I&#39;ve been spelling it wrong.
    No wonder I couldn&#39;t find it. I haven&#39;t come across this site before,
    Chester at Thirstype told me about it. It&#39;s great  knowing that I have somewhere
    to go to ask for help. Thanks again! <BR> <BR>Grace
