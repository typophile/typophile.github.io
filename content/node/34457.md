    talking about?  If not, can you please post a picture of it?\r\n\r\nAre you planning
    to use 'Lula' for headings, and you want us to suggest a text face to go with
    it, or are you looking for an alternative to Lula?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "\r\n\r\nNo, the typeface isn't called Lula; the word printed says 'Lula'.
    Still no joy inserting image.\r\n\r\nHeadings not body text. But irrelevant if
    you can't see what i'm talking about......\r\n\r\nThanks anyway"
