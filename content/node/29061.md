  \r\nEither will do if you know a match. In the example below, there is ITC Garamond
  paired with Akzidenz Grotesk. I am looking for something similar. Please let me
  know if you've got something!\r\nThanks a lot.\r\nOk, take 'er easy\r\n\r\nJ P H\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img0032_5028.jpg]"

    Adobe or Stempel Garamond. I would really like to use Akzidenz. Would it be a
    crime to use Akzidenz with Stempel? Thanks again. \r\n\r\nJ P H"

  body: "Not a crime.\r\nBut it depends on what you want.\r\nGaramond has a stronger
    character Akzidenz-Grotesk has.\r\nSo it only makes sense to use Garamond for
    the important part of your design. And AG for the other one.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
