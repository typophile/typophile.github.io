  at the bottom? Please note that I do NOT mean the font used on movie posters. The
  font I mean is the one that might say \"NOT AUTHORIZED FOR SALE OR RENTAL OUTSIDE
  THE USA This copyrighted product has been...\" etc...\r\n\r\nAny feedback welcome.
  \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Looking at one of the two DVD cases I have available and I'd say Futura Medium
    Condensed. But I would honestly think it can change from case-to-case. I am looking
    at the back of a Sons of Anarchy case and it doesn't specifically say: \"NOT AUTHORIZED
    FOR SALE OR RENTAL OUTSIDE THE USA This copyrighted product has been...\" it says
    something more like: \"The unauthorized reproduction...\" and that is set in Futura
    Medium Condensed.\r\n\r\nI looked on the other case and it looked like that type
    of text was laid out in Helvetica of some sort. Can't upload an image to get a
    more exact answer?"

    DVD if that helps.

    attaching to here.

  body: "Looking at Hall Pass (a WB flick) and it's not Univers because the lowercase
    y's descender curves.\r\n\r\nI still think that it just depends on the movie,
    which is why we need an example, or at least need to know what movie you are looking
    at."

  body: "Ok here ya go. Thanks for the tip. Text is at the bottom for \"NOT AUTHORIZED...\"
    \r\n\r\nAlso while I'm at it, though I said I wasn't looking for it, I was also
    curious about the \"Hanna Barbera Presents\" font. I have been using a movie poster
    type font that I found online but there's something not quite right about it (i.e.
    in the image you will see \"Written by Don Nelson\", well with the movie poster
    font I've been using the word \"written\" will be on top of the word \"by\". And
    even if I can find correct font, I'm interested in the precise size of \"Written
    By\" in relation to \"Don Nelson\". I'm basically just trying to duplicate the
    text in attached image as best I can).\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Resized-85BW5_4087.jpg]"

  body: "The scan doesn't actually help too much. I assumed it would be zoomed in
    to the text you needed help with.\r\n\r\nThat being said I would just go with
    Univers Condensed, Futura Condensed or something similar. It's going to either
    be correct or very close and you really can't go wrong with any of those suggestions
    in this situation.\r\n\r\nSame rules apply for the Hanna Barbera Presents. I just
    did some movie posters and I used Knockout for that portion of the posters."
