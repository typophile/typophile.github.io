  the use of Bevel fonts (see example image below) and I am struggling to find a history
  of the font - where it came about/why it came about/any decent foundries that specialise
  in Beveled fonts.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows anything about Bevel fonts i'd really appreciate
  it. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRobyn\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dec3fc209c572f059de29c8738eb26_6720.gif]"

    greater success eliciting assistance if you can demonstrate what you have accomplished
    on your own. You may also wish to consider using your real name as your screen
    name. It used to be somewhat of a convention here, and it has been my experience
    that it results in being taken a little more \u201Cseriously.\u201D It also makes
    addressing people by name easier and less confusing, but that\u2019s a personal
    decision.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and may the fonts be with you\u2122."

    subsequently that Dave [patterned his design after a woodtype typeface from 1848...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/double-d-nf/\r\n\r\nOne
    possible reason? Larger point size, less ink used?"
