  of a sentence in body copy, which itself ends with a period?\r\n\r\nIf the TM symbol
  is treated like any other character, and a period follows it, there's an unsightly
  gap between the last \"real\" letter in the word of the sentence and the closing
  period.\r\n\r\nSometimes I'll manually track in the period until it sits underneath
  the TM symbol (and appears where it normally would if there wasn't a TM symbol at
  all) but this can look busy.\r\n\r\nIs one of the two above treatments preferred,
  or is there another method?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nR\r\n"

  body: I would follow your idea of tracking it in, but if it is looking busy, then
    you probably have tracked too much. You only want to make it look less out of
    place.

  body: I'd agree. Not too much, the period still needs to visually follow, even if
    only by a T. ;^)

  body: Just a note. If you cannot kern the trademark symbol and the period to your
    satisfaction, edit the sentance so the trademark does not appear at the end.

  body: Kern, baby, kern. You don't have to kern it all the way in, as if the TM symbol
    wasn't there, but you should bring it in a little, at least. It's not too different
    from having a closing quote mark at the end of a sentence.
