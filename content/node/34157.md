body: "About 4 months ago I came across a foundry that had a large number of retro
  fonts that would only be suitable for text type things, say a 40's style diner menu
  or something like an old newspaper story. I sort of remember them saying that their
  fonts had been used in movies for props (newspaper clippings, signage, etc). I bookmarked
  the site, but due to a glitch in Safari, I lost the bookmark!\r\nCan anyone help
  me out here?\r\nI have a 30's-40's Big Band that wants me designing their CD and
  I'd love to find that site again!"
