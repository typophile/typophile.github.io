  body: "I'm not positive but I know there was a brand called Eternal that looked
    an awful lot like this carried at a store called The Buckle.. I just checked the
    brands they carried and it's no longer on the list but many similar styles and
    very sharp logos\r\n\r\nGo to http://www.buckle.com\r\nand click on Brands"

  body: "I get what you're saying about the \"y\" but at the same time Eternyl posted
    above has a totally different style of design and completely different type of
    brand.. as opposed to the sample t-shirt posted.\r\n\r\nThis one is rather confusing.
    This may just be one of those cheap knock-offs sold around E-bay or something
    where they were trying to copy Eternal Unlimiteds style."
