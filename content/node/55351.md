body: "I was thinking about my last visit to Europe and got to feeling nostalgic.
  Last summer, I went to the Guggenheim in Venice and had the pleasure of seeing pieces
  by my favorite sculptor, Alexander Calder.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/762553137_ph_web_4074.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  not really big on sculptures but I love his mobiles because they appear so delicate.
  I get inspiration for my own work from his pieces. It forces me to pay special attention
  to the minute details and try to embellish on them in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nHere is
  a link to the Calder Foundation: [[http://calder.org|http://calder.org/]]"
