  came across two faces that I fell in love with. (Moreso #1 than #2, but still) Anyone

    body: Wow, Alias is really cool! I can definitely see myself using their <a href="http://www.alias.uk.com/progress_frameset.html">Progress</a>
      or <a href="http://www.alias.uk.com/anomoly_frameset.html">Anomoly</a> for similar
      applications.  Thanks for pointing them out!
