    number of fonts in that style, the classiest/fanciest of which might be this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/wilhelm-klingspor-gotisch/\r\n\r\nOne
    word of warning: any font with such intricate details requires a very good tattoo
    artist otherwise the results will be a permanent blemish on your existence!  :-)\r\n\r\nSee

  body: "People regularly post on Typophile.com, attaching samples of letterforms
    they'd like to use for a tattoo, and asking for help with the name of the font.
    I don't quite understand the question.\r\n\r\nI don't have any tattoos, but if
    I wanted one, I would find a tattoo artist who was an expert at lettering, and
    then I'd show him/her the sample and say \"Please match this style of lettering.\"
    The tattoo artist isn't going to stick my butt in an inkjet printer, so why would
    he/she need to know the name of the font?"

    leveraging the skills of a -hopefully good- type designer. Except that makes it
    not really lettering, but faux type (which to me can look nice if it's obviously
    faux).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to be an excellent community. The reason i wanted the font name was so that i
    could write out my tattoo and show the artist exactly what i wanted it to look
    like (the less guess work the better).  \r\n\r\n"

    sort of wet transfer paper and positioned on my arms. Only after my <em>specific</em>
    approval, he did the job for real.\r\n\r\n(They're not typographic. I love fonts
    ... but every few years I love different ones.)"
