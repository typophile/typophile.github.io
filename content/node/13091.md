  made for her website? it is different from the one on her album cover so I thought
  there might be a slight chance :) ty in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nI've already
  tried : http://www.identifont.com/identify.html and http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/
  with no real luck.\r\n\r\nFont here : http://www.shakira.com\r\n\r\nalso attached
  it just in case it doesn't work :)"

  body: Well, since the "a" characters are different, I would suspect that this is
    custom work.

  body: "that's true.. I didn't really noticed\r\n\r\nbut the way they colored it
    and stuff I figured they could switch it up a bit to make it look more hand written
    but it might be a font *shrug*\r\n\r\nthanks for pointing that out :)  know of
    anything similar? more so of the S.. I love the S..."

  body: There were modifications, especially to that S, but I think that <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?q=endor++c&nb_ppp_old=10&page=1&text=Shakira&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha"
    target="_blank">Endor</a> was definitely the base font. I like Dav's suggested
    fonts a lot better, though. Endor is just trying to mimic the lettering off of
    the Charmed TV series.

    \ one show, eh? \r\n\r\nI really can't believe it's a real font I gave up after

    those are beautiful fonts also :) but I'm glad Mike found something so perfect

  body: Er, that certainly appears to be Kruella, doesn't it? I see that Endor is
    listed as a Buffy font on several fan sites, but, not being a fan myself, I have
    no idea what the inspiration for it was.
