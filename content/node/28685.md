body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI wonder if there was an outline operation available
  in fontlab to round the corner of a form as Xtream path does in illustrator\u2026
  I saw that the bold operation have a \"rounded corner\" option. But I would like
  to make the round corners without bolded the glyphs.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    it lighter first and then make it bolder again using round corners. This will
    change te design of the glyph.\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: yes I already tried that. My font family is a sans serif but I have an hairline
    weight that does not support the bold and light operation, because it's too thin
    :(

  body: "You could start your hairline weight as an unstroked path.\r\nHowever, the
    \"Expand path\" command is a little cranky.\r\nI've found that it's necessary
    to \"Break Contour\" at every point before expanding, in order to get a smooth
    effect, and even then some clean-up is required after \"Merge contour\".\r\nIf
    anyone knows of a better way...."

  body: "Me too I will do it in Illustrator. And as I already draw the weights I don't
    feel like doing it all over again. My problem sounds to be unsolvable in Fontlab.
    I hope some day someone will write a little plug in (or a little script) for Fontlab
    to create this kind of effect. I think lots of people would like to have the opportunity
    to do it in fontlab and I think it is a big lack from the soft. Illustrator have
    it since (almost) the very begin\u2026 "
