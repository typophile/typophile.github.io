body: "I have been looking for this font for years. The closest match is \"ZionTrain\"
  (see letter A), but there are certain details that differ. The font \"Prometo ExtraBold\"
  for the word \"PUBLISHING\" is a good candidate too. Could it be possible, that
  this is a handmade font?\r\n\r\nIt's pretty old (~2002/2004) and hard to imagine
  that somebody without special computer skills was able to create a custom font at
  this time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rogo-index_4453.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-1_5391.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/publi_6495.jpg]"
