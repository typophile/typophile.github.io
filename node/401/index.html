		<div class="commentbody">Very true, David.  <BR>But does one need for that to make a 'grid', as a horizontal and/or vertical setup where to put what? <BR>I agree with the fact that you have to lead the eye to the key-point (with a businesscard that is mostly the name or the logo) in the design. From there on you have then to access the rest of the information. I call this hierarchy. That is in every design important. Otherwise all the elements try to be the Nr. 1. <BR> <BR>Who works than with a real 'Grid' to design businesscards? I'm interested to see how that then works. I agree with Hrant that you have to have optical allignments. Is that then the grid??? <BR> <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here goes. <BR> <BR>This the new ID system for my freelance business. Designed to a grid? As Keith suggested, the internal design grid. This was designed knowing that I was moving in the near future. Name and address info are two rubber stamps. That way, all I need to do is get new stamps once the move is complete. Also, I don't go through a ton of letterhead, so I make them one at a time with the stamps on whatever paper I want. Envelopes printed one color then stamped with the correct address. So crafty. <BR> <BR>Randy <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12200.gif" alt="aquatoad identity"></div>
