body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm an illustrator (the kind with paints, paper and brushes rather
  than a computer) and I'm completely new to the world of font making.  However, I
  would like to be able to make my own font and then use that font to write on top
  of a background image that I have painted and scanned in.  \r\n\r\nBasically, I
  guess that means creating a font then being able to type it onto a high resolution
  image.  \r\n\r\nI'm looking for advice as to what software I can buy to accomplish
  this.  (I already have Adobe photoshop.)   All advice would be really appreciated
  - I've run searches online but there's so much on offer and I don't know where to
  start!\r\n\r\nThanks very much."

    of the illustration (the usual method).\r\nOr you can paint, draw, write the text
    as a separate illustration and add to the other illustration as another layer.\r\nOr
    if type is what you want then check out the software available from Fontlab.\r\nPerhaps
    a sample of what you trying to achieve might help generate more accurate advice."

  body: "Thanks - I've looked at Fontlab and it does seem good.  \r\n\r\nThe reason
    I don't want to write by hand is that I need display nearly two hundred different
    children's poems onto full colour illustrated background.  Doing them all by hand
    would simply be too much work.  (I have a template for the background, which was
    painted then scanned - I'm sorry I can't include a copy for copyright reasons.)
    \r\n\r\nI should be able to create an original font without too much difficulty
    - but what I'm concerned about how I can then type that font onto my background
    image.  For example, if I make a font using the Fontlab sofware, would I be able
    to export that font into something like photoshop or not?  \r\n\r\nThanks again.
    \ Sorry if my questions sem basic - but it's all new to me."

  body: You can use just about anything and any font in photoshop. Once you add your
    font into your computer's font folder it will be available in photoshop. Using
    the type tool, (its the tool that looks like a 'T') click anywhere on your painting
    and type away. Once typed you can then freely change size, colour and everything
    else plus move the type around to where ever you want. Photoshop places type on
    a new layer every time you type. Simple & easy, try it and see. Open any image
    in photoshop, select the type tool and start typing. The type will appear on a
    transparent layer and wont affect the image.

    my font would be available in photoshop so easily - I thought I''d have to do
    something really complicated to be able to use it there!  Your help has been much
    appreciated and I hope you have a really great day. :) '

    neither inexpensive, nor easy to learn, though it is the tool most used by professional
    type designers.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nT"

    [[http://www.high-logic.com/scanahand.html]] \r\nThe software is less complex
    and less expensive than FontLab. You will only need a (Virtual) PC, scanner and
    $49,-\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Fontlab is one option. If you plan on doing most of the drawing by hand you
    might be better off with Scanfont and Typetool or even Illustrator and Typetool.
    But font design is not as simple as you think; the learning curve for spacing
    and kerning is particularly brutal.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what your time budget
    is like, but if you need this done fast you\u2019ll probably be better off to
    just work your design out on paper and pass it on to a type designer for digitization,
    spacing, and kerning. If this is a simple font without the need for numbers, punctuation,
    and accents I could probably digitize it for less than it would cost you to buy
    Fontlab."
