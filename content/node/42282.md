  not designed to be used so big, as it looks a bit weird and lumpy and maybe we should
  consider looking for something else) that 'It may look wrong from a type person
  point of you, but the readers aren't going to notice are they? I don't think it
  looks bad. It's all about opinions, everyone has got an opinion' \r\n\r\nDo I respond;\r\n\r\na)Incredulously.\r\n'You're

  \r\n'I know they may not notice it and write a letter in complaining, but they will
  subconsciously react.'\r\n\r\nc)Insultingly.\r\n'You don't know what the hell you're

    care about your type and wish to handle the situation with tact.\r\n\r\nMy gut
    reaction says a combination of <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, with
    the weight on <strong>b</strong>.\r\n\r\nBut, what will support your defense?
    Are many of your readers the kind who will notice or care? Etc...\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, and keep us posted!"

  body: "e. Then why the f**k did you hire a graphic designer if none of this matters!?\r\n\r\nIn
    all honesty, my response to this sort of reaction is typically something along
    the lines of:\r\n\r\n\"To someone trained to catch these things, it's a glaring
    error. (this is good because it implies that other professionals will judge the
    publication) To the reader, it will not be a glaring error, but doing it the right
    way will feel better to their eyes and invite their attention. Typesetting is
    not about making a few big decisions, it's about making many tiny decisions that
    are then repeated hundreds or thousands of times, and that's why I nitpick. If
    I didn't, I wouldn't be a very good designer and the the production value of the
    work would decline. (Then, I summarize with something snappy they can repeat to
    other people to sound good when defending their decision to let me do my job.)
    It's the difference between a steak at a diner and a steak at a fine restaurant.
    They're both cow on a plate, but the attention to the details collectively makes
    the difference.\"\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    down with my anthropocentric tastes. But should I feed it to her? There's the
    question.

  body: rugen nailed it, but be careful and even indirectly flattering. appeal to
    his good sense in having a designer, and appeal to his wisdom in letting a designer
    do the designing. sounds manipulative, i know, but sometimes you have to kill
    them with kindness.

    both yourself and your editor on your findings. It is almost always easier or
    faster to <em>show</em> somebody why something does or does not work rather than
    insist on arguing. In a good design, the results are obvious. Who knows, maybe
    he's right? Or maybe he just hasn't seen what you're talking about with his own
    eyes.\r\n\r\nBesides, some professional art directors intentionally choose to
    use the micro size types like Freight Micro and Bell Centennial, just because
    they <em>are</em> slightly unusual, and thus, eye catching.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "FWIW, I believe Wired magazine in the U.S. used Freight Micro as body copy
    for some feature-length stories before their redesign last year.\r\n\r\nYou'll
    have to take my word for it, but the body copy in \"Heroes of Color\" is Freight
    Micro. And I realize this isn't a long story, but it was the first example I could
    find on the interwebs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teshkeelcomics.com/contn/wired002.jpg"

  body: "Thanks everyone. \r\n\r\nJust to clarify, I haven't got a problem with us
    using freight micro for body copy. It works wonderfully for this, but I'm just
    not sure about using it for display.\r\n\r\nI'm probably gonna find a few examples
    to demonstrate how they would be better. One of the problems is that my editor
    bypassed myself and my art director in getting the redesign of our magazine farmed
    out to some guy. We didn't see any of it until it was all OK'd by everyone who
    had to OK it. I think that my editor thinks we may be objecting to the font out
    of bitterness (which is probably partly responsible) but also we just don't think
    it works. I also think that he has taken it as a personal affront because in a
    way its his design, or at least he commissioned it.\r\n\r\nAnother problem lies
    in the fact that both he and the deputy editor reckon their design knowledge quite
    a lot. I do respect his opinion, and often he makes excellent suggestions, but
    it is sometimes hard to get him to see what I see as sense. \r\n\r\nOh well, I
    will tread cautiously\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks again. I'll keep yar updated\r\n\r\nG"
