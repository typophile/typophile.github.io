body: "I was reading through the <i>Texts on Type</i> book and came to Jonthan Hoefler's
  essay: <i>On Classifying Type</i> which talks about an ambitious project to archive
  lettering called the 'Central Lettering Record'. This essay was written in 1977
  though; I was wondering if anyone has a clue about whether or not it is still available
  and if so where?\r\n\r\nSearches on the internet turns up Phil Baines' biography
  more than about the actual CD itself..."

    Dixon at Central Saint Martins in London. It started in 1963 and as far as I know
    it is a photographic collection of lettering.\r\n"

    other than visiting the CSM..

  body: Didn't know it was released as a CD. I've been a student at CSM and remember
    that we we're asked to contribute when we started our course. Have you tried to
    send an email to Phil or Catherine? Their details should be on the CSM website.
