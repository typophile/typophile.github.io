  body: "Sorry, wasn't able to spot any good substitute, even loosely similar. I guess
    it should be considered as a custom job, meaning not a font. Notice also how the
    A nestles into both curves of /J and /G, this can't lie. \r\nIf you need it, you
    can grab it as vector [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/lego-ninjago|here]]."
