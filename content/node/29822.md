  body: "There are more differences in character sets than just Arabic and Thai. Lucida
    Grande has many more characters that Lucida Sans Unicode is missing (I'm comparing
    Lucida Grande version 5.0d8e1 with Lucida Sans Unicode version 2.03). Lucida Sans
    Unicode is pretty old and my guess is that Microsoft did not get it updated recently.
    So Lucida Grande supports some Unicode ranges that were not yet assigned at the
    time when Lucida Sans Unicode was built, for example Latin Extended Additional
    (starting with U+1E00 \u1E00). L. Grande has polytonic Greek, many more historical
    and Asian Cyrillic characters (e.g. U+0468 \u0468), many more Latin Extended-B
    characters (e.g. U+0222 \u0222). The design of some characters has been corrected
    or updated, e.g. the commaaccent characters (e.g. U+0137 \u0137), the phonetic
    U+0251 (\u0251), the Cyrillic U+0444 (\u0444) and U+046A (\u046A), and many others.
    \r\n\r\nThe hinting differs greatly: the stems in Lucida Sans Unicode turn into
    two pixels at 15 ppem while in Lucida Grande they only do so at 18 ppem. The 17
    ppem size of Lucida Grande uses 1-pixel stems plus antialiasing, which does not
    at all work well in the normal Windows 2000/XP rasterizer. This is evidence that
    the font has not been hinted with Windows in mind but was specifically hinted
    for Mac OS X where it works great. However, in Windows XP ClearType, it is Lucida
    Grande that performs better than Lucida Sans Unicode, which evidently has been
    \"overhinted\" and displays a weird high linear contrast up to 24 ppem, while
    the stems in Lucida Grande appear pleasantly equalized already from 18 ppem on.
    \r\n\r\nThese would be the first quick observations from my side. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    is indeed true.\r\nBy default in Cocoa apps, and Carbon apps that use ATSU (which
    is about 99% of them these days), if the current face has no italic/oblique or
    bold available, the respective menu items/buttons will be dimmed.\r\nNonetheless,
    software can programmatically request a closest match for a face that has no italic,
    which will return an italic face from similar font family that has the same traits
    (proportional, serif, same weight, &c.). The app can then accept this alternative,
    or reject it and have an oblique algorithmically generated instead.\r\nFor apps
    that use QuickDraw for text (BBEdit &lt; version 8, maybe others?) oblique is
    always generated if one doesn't exist."
