body: "I am putting together a book about a photographer who made these particular
  photographs in the '60's. I am looking for a typeface (or two) for headline and
  body copy that was created then. Another possibility the images all had TV's in
  them so a font that was used on TV a lot or used in the newspaper listings would
  also work well. I read an old thread and a lot of people were mentioning cooper
  black but my teacher doesn't like it, though in this case it might be appropriate.
  \r\n\r\nany help would be much appreciated,\r\n\r\nthanks. "
