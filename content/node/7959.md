  body: Well, this isn&#39;t exactly a solution, but maybe the concept of transluscent
    overlapping might help. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54907.jpg"

  body: Gregory why not be up front and ID the color coding in the talk balloons.
    Just keep them separate and put General in the orange balloon. Hungrian in the
    green balloon and Europe in the blue balloon. Why be cleaver when you need direct
    clean communications.

  body: 'The bottom sample of the logo: I read this as multiple voices. Your idead,
    Scott, of somehow overlapping, could also somehow help it read more along the
    lines of multiple voices heard as one voice. Or something like that? <BR> <BR>The
    use of the logo in the adverts and the posters: I wonder if the talky-balloon
    could face the other direction. Sometimes? In the adverts especially it causes
    visual direction away from the ad instead into the ad. Where/How it is used at
    the bottom of the posters however seems to be directional in a positive way. <BR>
    <BR>Adverts: Not sure about the different sizes used on the black bars. Might
    be better if the photos could be full-bleed. They look as if they are very dramatic
    and I think the forceful &#40;too assymetrical?&#41; use of black is diminishing
    this. <BR> <BR>Posters: The paragraphs seem too close to the sides, more white
    space? And instead of the headline mimicking the color of the logo used I think
    it would be really strong to somehow use the 3 colors in the logo. Maybe? The
    word spacing is too much in the headlines also.  <BR> <BR>Very fun solution overall.'

    maybe its better. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55374.jpg"
    alt="bkf_1206_a"> <BR> <BR>So what happenes about the adverts, atthe top with
    the black lines: <BR>they were only inspirational photographs i took in the school,
    to c what shades, what color system they might have. so they r aint designs, they
    r just screenshots from ACDC with the black borders on top and at the sides -
    depending if it was a portrait or a landscape pict. - i promise i gonna use fullbleed
    picts, in case of.. err... everywhere where it is possible ! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>talky baloon direction:  <BR>prety much u r right..
    they r taking attention out of the poster. thanks. its remade. <BR> <BR>Posters:
    <BR>white space? okay. i try. u might b right... <BR>but tell me why have u thought
    so? <BR>word spacing in the headlines? gee.. i soo much aint pay attention about
    theese. excuse me.. i&#39;ll correct it. <BR> <BR>u say: <BR>&#34;talking voices
    making together one...&#34; <BR>why i havent posted this thread earlyer? <IMG

    get expensive. 3&#43;1 colors in one little logo could make a mess. <BR> <BR>what
    have u imagined about this?'
