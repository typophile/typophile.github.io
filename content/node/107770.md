  and typography at a community college in southern ontario (carl dair's hometown,
  in fact). we are in the process of revising our curriculum and i have been tasked
  with doing some research into the type design component of our curriculum. i thought
  the folks on this forum would have some valuable and usable input into our process.\r\n\r\nwhen
  i was at design school in the late 1980s, we had one minor type design project as
  part of our larger type design course (15 hours per week). but i wish that i had
  had more. \r\n\r\nso, my questions are : \r\nhow much type design is appropriate/useful
  in a three-year graphic design diploma?\r\nare there specific types of projects
  that you have found helpful in your own experience?\r\n\r\nthanks"

    specializations within the program? Would you get somebody with real type design
    expertise to teach this?

    the curriculum that is being developed (which is more of a bow to economics than
    anything else)\r\nwe don't have defined specializations within the programme\r\nand,
    yes, we will have someone with real type design expertise teaching this"

    designers, I would find the person to teach the course, and get them to design
    it with your input.\r\n\r\nDifferent type designers have different strengths,
    and different ideas about priorities and even process. You'll probably get a better
    course by getting them to structure it."
