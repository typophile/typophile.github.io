  body: '@5star: I to am interested to see what your other work is like. I do not
    recall seeing any graffiti artists post work for critique here before. Typography
    and graffiti have a long standing relationship. If you haven''t already seen it,
    I highly recommend the documentary <a href ="http://www.bombit-themovie.com/">Bomb
    It</a>.'

  body: "Thanks for the comments! Good stuffs, great to read what you see.\r\n\r\n@Christopher:
    I haven't seen that one. I've seen Style Wars and Exit Through The Candy Shop.
    I urge all to see Exit Through The Candy Shop. Great doc. great social comment
    on our time.\r\n\r\nI'll post up more in less than a week ...sorry, I have to
    leave it at that. On second thought, I'll gather up my very raw prelims and post
    up what I've done so far along with the idea of what FREE LOVES is all about.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

    and low for the other fifth and finally decide to go with something I did a while
    ago. I'll scan 'em and have 'em up in the day.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas to you and
    you and you too!\r\n\r\n"
