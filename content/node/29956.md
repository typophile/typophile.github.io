  it with no kerning above, and tightened to balance out the spacing below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mythkerning_3625.png]\r\n\r\nIf
  I open the rest up enough to match YT with even a tiny space the entire word breaks
  apart. Pulling stuff together yielded the monstrosity above. Suggestions?"

    so, I would suggest opening up the space between T & H and slightly tightening
    the space between M Y T. Only slightly moreso between the MY than the YT. the
    corners on the top of the Y should nearly touch the tops of the M and T. \r\n\r\nHow's
    this?:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/myth_kern_4367.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    you're displaying this much smaller, the overall space should open up.\r\n"

  body: You do not have to make all the negative space exactly equal to each other,
    like in your bottom example. Seventy7's version looks quite balanced, eventhough
    the spaces are not equal in size.
