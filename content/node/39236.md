  body: "I am a pick snob but these are nice.\r\n\r\nMy favorite ever was Mel Bay
    green, but they stopped making them.\r\n\r\nI like to use a light pick for the
    first 2 songs so I don't knock my guitar out of tune or break strings (too much
    adrenalin) - once I'm settled in I go to a medium which is my weapon of choice.\r\n\r\npbc"

    myself in E strings if I used one of those.\r\nNice pun, though."

    Fender lights for playing acoustic but they break easily. "

  body: "I like the red Dunlop Tortex picks myself. I recently picked up some of <a
    href=\"=http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/Dunlop-474R-STUBBY-JAZZ-PICKS?sku=110080\">these
    Dunlop stubbys</a>, and though they take some time to get used to, they're quite
    nice. Takes a fairly different style of playing though.\r\n\r\nAs for the Orange
    amps, my friend had a nice sounding 4x10 or 4x12 Orange cabinet many years ago.
    Although, at this point I'm sure it's the company in name only (sort of like Danelectro,
    although their reissues are pretty nice cheap guitars)."

    the brand. \r\n\r\nMight read up here\u2014\r\n\r\nhttp://www.orangeamps.com/forumtest/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=3\r\n\r\nThese

  body: Those tortex picks are truely indestructable. I once dug a hole in the ground
    to bury a dead cow with just a tortex pick on a stick, and I still play it...
    And that RockWell is great! I am going to get me one. :)
