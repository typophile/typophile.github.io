body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI would love a critique of the typeface I'm developing
  for my honours project this year. The two fonts below are the display cuts in an
  extra-bold and light weight. It's going to be used as part of an identity system
  for an artist-run initiative in Melbourne. Previously they were using Reader for
  headlines and Parry Grotesque for body copy. The naivety and clunkiness of early
  British grotesques was the formal starting point.\r\n\r\nThis is my first proper
  foray in to type design and I've yet to go through kerning pairs so forgive any
  awkward combinations. Love to hear your impressions, criticism, suggestions.\r\n\r\n\u2014Vin[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jones_Preview_4208.png]"

  body: A nice start, although I think the style difference is too big. They look
    like two similar typefaces to me. The Extra bold weight looks much wider. But
    it's a good start... I would start by making the regular/medium master weight.
    Good luck.
