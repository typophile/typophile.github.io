This was a sketchbook assignment for my Typology class. The word was tweak, and we could take it any way we wanted to and this is where it lead for me. I did handlettering in my sketchbook, then traced it in Illustrator. I changed it up a bit though. My teacher suggested I make some 3D so that's exactly what I did. I did the word tweak to give it emphasis. My only real inspiration for this (other than the word "tweak" itself) was the drink special sign I draw every week for the restaurant work. I alternate these typefaces above on the sign so I combined them all in this one piece. If I had to pick a time period this reflects, I'd have to say Dada, only because of the combination of multiple typefaces. My grid obviously contradicts that though. How about you tell me...what time period to YOU GUYS think this piece reflects. I'm interested in knowing what you think.</div>

I really like this interpretation of the sketchbook assignment. It is very funny, and I'm sure that everyone from the class can relate to it. I remember liking it when I say it in your sketchbook, but tracing it in Illustrator really helped to clean it up. I like the combination of fonts and the turning of words. It makes it seem interactive and it helps my attention just looking at the different text. I could really see this as a poster. It kind of has a feel of an inspirational poster. Not in a cheesy way, just that it is funny but still has a strong message. I'd like to see this with some color worked into it. I think it could really change the mood of the piece in any direction you'd want it to go. I love "tweak" in 3d and with all the letters connected.

Oh, and where do you work? I'd love to see the inspiration for this.
