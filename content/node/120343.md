body: "Hi,\r\nI have started designing a Cyrillic character set for my typeface, despite
  the fact I did not know practically anything about it. However, it was quite a big
  challenge for me. I have found little resources in books (mostly Russian ones) as
  well as on the internet and I checked few typefaces which I consider well done.
  But still, it was quite complicated to find any relevant information.\r\nSo I would
  like to ask you whether you could give me any feedback, I want to move on.\r\nThank
  you.\r\nJan"

    insight I have into the Cyrillic script.

  body: "I think it's very nice in general.\r\n\r\nThe only changes I would do is
    to reduce the breve's weight in the curve and increase it in the drops and maybe
    change the \u0423's foot based on \u041B's starting.\r\n\r\nNice job.\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes."
