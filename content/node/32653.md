  body: "I have a hunch that the 'a' might be manufactured from a 'c' and a straight
    line to create a distinctive variation for the logo. I also suspect editing of
    the 'l'. I think the c, r and s are the keys for this font. I think I might pick
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/formata-bq/\">Formata</a>, if
    I had to re-create this. Make the 'l' from the 't' by chopping off the cross bars.\r\n\r\n-

    I can see the rest look Gill-ish indeed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
