  been stated that it was yet to be released. I can't remember anything about the
  designer or any date other than perhaps the designer was from Holland, but if anyone
  knows it and has any info that would be great.\r\n\r\nJH[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4133.jpg]"

    of fonts designed after lettering by the Dutchman Boudewijn Ietswaart, as presented
    at ATypI Mexico last year. The fonts are [to be] released by FontShop AFAIK. I
    would also like to know if it's available yet."
