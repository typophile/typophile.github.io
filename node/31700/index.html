<p>Decimal points are a special case, since they are different characters depending on region and language, so some sort of contextual substitution would be in order for the comma, period, and space when adjacent to tabular figures as opposed to letters.

<p>Or</p>
<p>Oh! I see&hellip; Nick are you talking about monowidths in a regular font to support financial statement etc huh? Actually I should have understood that immediately because I have been modifying fonts for use in annual reports this last week. And the fact that the fonts they chose had standard widths in many cases made the job I was doing far far easier. And the comma and period were half spaces which I see now is clever too. I can&rsquo;t comment on vulgar fractions or mathematical operators. They didn&rsquo;t require them so I didn&rsquo;t look. And I had no samples of their use either. I look foreward to learning more when somebody who knows more than I chimes in!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If this is about tabular setting, some other considerations. I sometimes make up a comma.tab and a period.tab, not so much for their width but so they center better with the numbers &ndash; so the comma or period in 0,000 or 0.000 is a bit closer to the left digit than to the right. Never set financial statements, but I guess if I did, number-sized monetary symbols would be a plus.</p>
<p>In an OpenType font, I put in all the fixed spaces from Unicode 2002 through 200B. One of those is a &ldquo;figure space&rdquo; one a &ldquo;punctuation space,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve always taken to be used for a period or comma in tabular setting &ndash; fits with the Unicode description. There are lots of other spaces there, and designing elements for tables to one of the sizes shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard. This give you lots of ways to &ldquo;pad&rdquo; a table entry to keep decimal alignment.</p>
<p>When you write the features for tnum, just include the other glyphs you&rsquo;ve made up for tabular setting.</p>

<p>I always feared this would not be a safe method for glyphs like comma.tab, period.tab or figure space since users may select tabular figures even when typesetting text.</p>
<p>Also, if a font contains spaces of different width, or half-tab-width period and comma, how should the user see which is which since e.g. InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette shows the glyph shape but not the according space, and in case of spaces, empty cells.</p>
<p>So I am curious for some more comments, experiences from both type designers and typographers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an engineer, but I too can test out of Insufferable Arrogance 101. So if people can&rsquo;t find the right figures for text setting, the text will look bad in any case. And it should be pretty easy to notice you have the wrong set even without any numbers, since the periods &amp; commas won&rsquo;t be kerned &ndash; &ldquo;cap-P&rdquo; + &ldquo;comma&rdquo; would be a clear indication. But I can&rsquo;t test out of AI 202, so I suppose if you want to protect your customers you could not include such things, at the expense of the tables being harder to set &amp; not looking as good. You could also make a determination of which font&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t likely to be used for tabular setting &amp; not include either tabular numbers or any &ldquo;extras&rdquo; in them. Risky, I suppose.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, if a font contains spaces of different width, or half-tab-width period and comma, how should the user see which is which since e.g. InDesign’s glyph palette shows the glyph shape but not the according space, and in case of spaces, empty cells.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Some of the spaces are accessible through &ldquo;Insert Special Character.&rdquo; For the others, you can enter a character by its Unicode number from the keyboard. Ah, it was all so much easier before WYSIWYG.</p>
<p>edit &ndash;</p>
<p>I forgot to add, that my way of helping to ensure the wrong figures aren&rsquo;t used in text is to assign the name &ldquo;one&rdquo; (&amp; it&rsquo;s Unicode value) to the figure style I want to be default. Usually that is the &ldquo;oldstyle proportional,&rdquo; but if lining, it will be lining proportional. Features definitions are written accordingly. Of course, I only work on fonts for our small business, so that may not be a generally acceptable notion.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a clever idea, and it works for you Charles, but as Karsten points out, not if the default font is tabular, which is pretty much a standard, as it&rsquo;s what Adobe does for its revivals of classic text faces Garamond, Caslon, and Jenson.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you’re going to have tabular figures, it stands to reason that other characters typically adjacent to numerals (e.g.: math operators, currency symbols, space, decimal points) should be a matching width so they won’t disrupt the grid and throw the tabulation out of whack.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it does stand to reason. In theory, perhaps, but I&rsquo;d like specific real-world examples. I&rsquo;ve set a lot of different kinds of documents, and never needed adjacent characters to be the same width as figures.</p>
<p>Now, as a type designer, I see no reason to cram monetary symbols and math operators into narrow figure spaces.</p>
<p>IMO, monetary symbols and math operators should look good in U&amp;lc setting, as this is where they usually appear.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that the &ldquo;hard space&rdquo; model of arranging typographic space that was used in metal days, with en quads etc., is relevant in the digital realm, where tabs are set to infinitely-adjustable x-axis co-ordinates, and specific characters (eg decimal point) may be aligned &ndash; right, left, or centred &ndash; to those points.</p>

<p>Well, we did that with TeX (run out of a DOS box on Windows XP). You would set up to align left, right, or center, whichever was easier for a particular table column. Of course with TeX you could add any space value you wanted on the fly, but it was usually a few predictable characters, most of which have been mentioned.</p>
<p>With uni2002-uni200B, you get (in units) 1000, 500, 333, 250, 166, a figure space (make it the width of a tabular figure for each font), a punctuation space (again make if for each font), 200, and 55 (a hair space for me). In metal, that&rsquo;s an em, en, thick, mid, thin, hair, &amp; a couple more. Surely you can cram your non-numerical tabular glyphs into one of those.</p>
<p>If you are making a font you are selling/distributing, what does it matter what Adobe puts in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fonts? You&rsquo;d be better off to put in the proportional set of figures. And consider this: if you kern the period or comma with the 7 (for example) as would be normal in text, you will lose decimal alignment in any table using 7,407.62 &ndash; if you make your tabular figures the default, you can&rsquo;t have any kerning with them, right?</p>

<p>OpenType features are for CS users.
CS comes with a group of bundled Adobe OT fonts, which are the de facto standard.
If my fonts behave differently than Adobe&rsquo;s, people will think there&rsquo;s something wrong with them.</p>
<p>To illustrate this: Last year I designed some custom fonts for a newspaper, with proportional figures as default. A few months later they contacted me, asking if I could provide an alternate font with figures for use in tabular settings. So I explained that all the fonts I had supplied, which were OpenType, already had that feature, all they had to do was select it from the OT menu.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you kern the period or comma with the 7 (for example) as would be normal in text, you will lose decimal alignment in any table using 7,407.62 — if you make your tabular figures the default, you can’t have any kerning with them, right?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Right, but when people select proportional figures, then they get the kerning.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Surely you can cram your non-numerical tabular glyphs into one of those.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But why bother? Digital typographers position type at a tab position by entering a numerical tab value in the layout application, not by filling up the space between the left margin and the tab position by quads and spaces.</p>
<p>Charles, in what circumstances do you use all those unicode spaces you customize your fonts with? Examples please!</p>
<p>And no, those values don&rsquo;t work out for &ldquo;non-numerical tabular&rdquo; glyphs: if the figures are 500, then the $ fits that OK, but Sterling and Euro will be 600 (more for a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Euro). Mathematical operators, I find, need a bit of space built in, so around 700 is good.</p>
