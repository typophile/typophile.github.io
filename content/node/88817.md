  that I can tweak it to match this logo) for a local car dealership. \r\n\r\nNeed
  to proof out their ad today (the fun of newspaper deadlines), hope someone is able
  to assist with this, it'd be very appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks so much :)\r\n\r\nP.S.
  Haven't had any luck with What the Font or Identifont for this sample."
