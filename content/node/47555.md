  visual marks of various kinds.  I\u2019ve assembled a small group of international
  scholars who work on similar problems but in diverse fields (philosophy, neuroscience,
  music, etc.).  We\u2019re working on a series of papers and have begun to meet once
  or twice a year in Cambridge and London, but much of our collaboration needs to
  take place online.  I\u2019m going to create a modest but functional web site for
  sharing research.  Since we\u2019re all keenly interested in visual information,
  I thought it would be fun to have a striking visual of some sort \u2013 a logo or
  a style template.  Several members are well-known visual artists, but I want to
  avoid adopting the work of any one member.  I don\u2019t have funding for design
  in any grant budget so it will just be me paying for it.  That means I can\u2019t
  pay very much.  Under the circumstances, does anyone have a suggestion for how I
  might find a designer I can afford and who has the aesthetic I\u2019m looking for?
  \ I thought about posting an ad for design students in programs at local universities,
  but that seems at least as difficult and the outcome more doubtful.  Thanks!"
