  body: "\r\nI\u2019m not very good at identifying type. However, one should mention
    that the layout of the \xABSuhrkamp\xBB series, done by legendary designer Willy
    Fleckhaus, is one of the most famous German book designs ever. Unfortunately,
    since a couple of years, they have changed and distorted the original look.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can read German, there are plenty of articles on Fleckhaus, \xABGermany\u2019s
    first Art Director\xBB, and \xABSuhrkamp\xBB\u2014even a whole book on the designer:
    \r\n\r\nMichael Koetzle, Carsten M. Wolff (Hrsg.)\r\nFleckhaus. Deutschlands erster
    Art Director\r\nVerlag Klinkhardt & Biermann, 2000 \r\n\r\nAnd I am sure that
    someone will soon identify the font.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It *IS* a version of Times Bold. I don't know which one, but this publisher
    used Times Bold on all of its bok covers for decades.

  body: It can't be Times Modern done for the Times that one is copletly recent ...
    Maybe there are two Times variations with the name Times Modern... Might be just
    some custom Times drawn by Willy for the verlag... Caslon Black gets close with
    the fettnes though... thanks for that one...
