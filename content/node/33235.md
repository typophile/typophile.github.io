  very seldom, so any feedback is welcome. I have a feeling the 's' and   the'e' could
  \ be better. I looked at a couple of fonts that at first glance looked suitable,
  but wouldn't do the trick. So I started drawing myself, keeping an eye at the features
  i liked in the initial fonts. \r\n\r\nThe logo is for a industrial design company.
  Serious but friendly etc. THe name is Kode Design.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nalex\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KOdeDEsign_3577.jpg]"

  body: "Well, I'll get the crit started.\r\n\r\nObviously, your d's aren't the same,
    is that on purpose? Also, your ascenders/descenders seem rather staunch. \r\n\r\nWhat
    kind of products do Kode Design design? I'm curious also about the decision behind
    choosing Blue and Black for the color scheme. if you're flexible with color choices,
    I'd consider something more subtle. It's clever that you picked out KO and DE,
    but the color choices feel as if you're pushing this idea down my throat instead
    of me slowly realizing it. Make it more subliminal.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it\xB4s very nice. And for the \"serious but friendly\" part, it\xB4s
    right on the spot. I think you should keep the colors.\r\nHere\xB4s some suggestments:\r\nThe
    ascender on the bottom d may be too short, make a printout in small sizes to check!\r\nThe
    ending on g should be more like that of e, at least in thickness.\r\nThe ending
    on e looks a bit flat in the middle, try shortening it for a more fluent ending.\r\nThe
    s needs some more weight in the middle. This will also make the endings less flat,
    which is a good thing.\r\nThe flared stroke on d and k may be applied on i, for
    consinstency\r\nMaybe you could do a whole typeface out of this?"

  body: "I think you've achieved the friendly/technical aspect right on! Here are
    my comments on shapes and etc.:\r\n\r\nThe \"e\" looks more condensed than the
    other letters, also, the way the counter and the beginning of the terminal (left
    part right below the counter doesn't look like it's flowing too well).\r\n\r\nYour
    \"g\" has a curved feel as opposed to a more vertical \"d\" - I'd go one way or
    another - not both.\r\n\r\nThe top anchor point on the lower case \"n\" is going
    from straight to round. Maybe smoothing that out would help consistency.\r\n\r\nI'd
    test the ascenders without angles. Agree with toby about the \"i\" in case you
    want to keep the angle.\r\n\r\nThe \"s\" looks lighter than the rest. Drawing
    S's is a pain in the s if you allow me a poetic license.\r\n\r\nIt's going to
    look nice when you're done!\r\n\r\nOne more vote for making it a typeface.\r\n\r\nRodrigo\r\n\r\n

    condensed, worked on the g (both angle and descender) and made the 's' a little
    fatter. I stay with the the angled ascenders.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3more_3776.jpg]\r\n\r\nnumber
    one is the same as before, but with the mentioned changes. \r\nnumber two is with

  body: "I like number 1 the best out of the latest batch. I still say that the 'g'
    needs some optical correction. The bowl should thin where it meets the descender,
    just like the 'e' in number 2.\r\n\r\nThe 's' is better weight-wise, but the curves
    at the bottom are looking a little lumpy.\r\n\r\nThe logo is progressing nicely
    though.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Hm, unfortunately I have to say I don't think it has improved over the last
    one. \r\nI find the decrease in weight making the characters a bit, I don't know,
    wobbly. \r\nAlso the difference in weight between the different characters has
    increased.\r\nI also think the round 'g' was much better, it was a better match
    with the other characters. The slanted crossbar of the 'e' is somewhat distracting,
    in my opinion, since it is a slant none of the other characters have. And about
    the colors, the blue looks a bit RGB-ish to me. The cyan was looking much more
    natural, although it needed some attention too.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm sounding
    a bit harsh, just giving my opinions. I think the first \r\n(or second, slightly
    adjusted) version is still the best. :)"

    The client didn't like the first weight, and the y really like the new one. So
    the weight stays. Colors aren't finished, but it's going to be something like
    this. \r\n\r\nas for the rounded 'g', they didn't like it. i also grew tired of
    it. i think it's too childish.\r\n\r\nwhat can be done to distribute weight better

  body: "Well, if you compare the 'd' with the 's', for example, there is quite a
    bit of difference in weight. As in the 'd' is much heavier (the 's' needs more
    weight). And the therminals ('s', 'e', 'g') get awfully thin, when compared to
    the 'normal' stroke width.\r\nThe old 'g' too childish? Maybe, but it was consistent
    as well.\r\n\r\nBut your outlines seem quite smooth. Only the top of the 'g' can
    use some attention (where the bowl connects to the top-right corner). I might
    make the curve the same as the 'n' (only mirrored of course).\r\n\r\nAs for the
    color, it has this PMS Reflex/Process Blue vibe going on now, if you know what
    I mean. With a touch of RGB-ness. I don't know, maybe you can go through a PMS
    swatchguide to pick one in the vicinity of the color you have now, that looks
    a bit more natural. :)\r\n\r\n[edit] fixed typo.\r\n"

    a bit too light. Maybe make it more like the lower part of the 'e'. But over all
    it's looking quite nice as it is now.
