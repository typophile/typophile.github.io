  Poverty. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a font based in early Renaissance typefaces as well as
  inscriptional letters found in paintings from the XVI and XVII centuries. <BR> <BR>At
  present it&#39;s optical size its suitable for display. Maybe, in the future, I
  will create another version for text use. Italics may come as well.  <BR> <BR>After
  having been working on this font for as long as I can remember I have a reached
  a point where your help is needed, my eye may bypass some details clearly visible
  to an experienced type designer. <BR> <BR>Hope you like it!'

  body: 'What PDF? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I think what you&#39;re trying to do is quite
    hard. Others who have made fonts like this have stuck to highly decorative results
    &#40;which is a lot easier&#41;, while you seem to be trying to shoot for text.
    Barnbrook&#39;s Priori &#40;from Emigre&#41; is something you might like to look
    at for possible ideas. <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re mostly on the right track,
    but some glyphs go too far while others are a bit too reserved. That first &#34;t&#34;
    and certainly that first &#34;o&#34; are examples of going too far, while most
    of the letters are too docile; I think you need some docility, especially among
    more frequent letters &#40;like the &#34;e&#34; - which I think is just right
    there&#41;, but some of your glyphs which are just pushy enough are: the second
    &#34;k&#34;, &#34;r&#34;, &#34;w&#34; and &#34;z&#34;. The &#34;g&#34; is really
    wonderful, just a little too strong on the finish of the tail. <BR> <BR>The caps
    seem more properly balanced &#40;considering their role&#41;, although it would
    be nice to have some fancier alternates. Your &#34;A&#34;, third &#34;K&#34;,
    second &#34;R&#34;, &#34;U&#34; and &#34;W&#34; are very nice, while the second
    &#34;Y&#34; for example seems too much here, and maybe things like the &#34;C&#34;
    need slightly more flair. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Thanks for your wise comments hhp. <BR>At present I&#39;m refining the glyphs,
    in search of that &#34;feeling&#34; and &#34;flair&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having
    troubles taking some decisions. Specially with the b, p and q. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/62939.jpg"

    the ones below. Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

  body: Hello Luis, <BR>It looks nice. <BR>But I think the h, n, u and m glyphs look
    to wide. <BR>The R looks a little like a P with a leg attached to it. <BR>The
    second g looks odd to me. <BR>Nice job!
