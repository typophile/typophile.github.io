  body: I think DHSans might be the one, it just needs to have a few strokes added
    in something like Adobe Illustrator, making the overall appearance thicker.

  body: The way that the middle ledger of the E is slightly shorter than the top and
    bottom make me think it might be Metro/DHSans after all.. Eagle seems like it
    might be a bit too wide?

  body: This is Nivea Bold, which is a custom corporate font based on Metro. From
    what I&#39;ve read on the web, it may have been done by E&amp;F. Achaz Reuss,
    an inhouse E&amp;F designer is mentioned as working of the project <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/micr.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>, as is another E&amp;F designer, Gisela Will, <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/atypi01.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>. It&#39;s also mentioned in passing  <a href="http://www.december14.net/site.shtml#start"
    target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.metadesign.de/html/en/131.html"
    target="_blank">here</a> . It&#39;s been covered here at typophile a few times
    before but as best as I can tell those seem to be in the large chunk of messages
    lost the archives disaster.
