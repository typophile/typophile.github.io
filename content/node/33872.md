  current trend for companies stealing photos and not paying has gotten out of hand.
  \r\n\r\nThis morning on TV the BBC News ended a story about this weeks FA Cup final
  with a request for people to send in there images from the days event. Gee that
  is a cheap way to get content. No need to send out photographer or pay them for
  that matter.\r\n\r\nThen there are the prowlers who ask to use your photos for their
  applications. I get request all the time. \r\n\r\nMany of my clients ask me to send
  some high res images to magazines and I get no credit usually. \r\n\r\nStop the
  open source style stealers, save a photographer today.\r\n\r\n"

    site had pasted in my thumbnail tables, complete with links to the source images
    on my host's server, making their own free photo site using only my photos and
    bandwidth. And filled it chock full of Google ads.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw they

    in that it's somewhat diffferent -- another way to phrase something, a different
    color combination that really makes it appear unique -- but at the root, it's
    modification.\r\nEven many designers make this point: Art Chantry, and Andy Warhol
    each borrow(ed) freely from surrounding culture. Milton Glaser's famous DYLAN
    poster is a direct modification of Marcel Duchamp's work. Mozart, Bach, Beethoven
