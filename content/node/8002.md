body: Hi everyone <BR> <BR>My name is Ragnar and I am from Iceland. <BR>I am doing
  my Bachelor Degree essay on International Typographic Style and was wondering if
  you could point to me some resources &#40;Books, websites, persons etc.&#41; on
  the subject? I have been doing a lot of research but I still think I need more material
  to make this a good essay. So if you have anything that I might be missing please
  post it on this thread. <BR> <BR>P.s. I am writing about ITS in regards to the post-war
  situation and if graphic design could ever be totally mechanised through the principles
  of the grid system and &#34;Swiss Typography&#34;. <BR> <BR>Thanks you very much,
  <BR> <BR>Ragnar Freyr <BR><a href="http://www.onrushdesign.com" target="_blank">www.onrushdesign.com</a>

  body: Armin Hofmann&#39;s Graphic Design Manual goes over many of the principals
    of swiss design. <BR> <BR>Seems like a interesting essay. I am currently working
    on a paper for school that deals alot with examples from the Swiss style to backup
    my writing. <BR> <BR>I own a few of the books mentioned above &#40;Armins Graphic
    Design Manual, Brockmanns Grid Systems and History of the Poster, Ruders book,
    if you need any scans or info on them&#41;
