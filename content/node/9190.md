  body: I think it is custom, and I seem to recall a freeware version of it among
    collections of movie title look-alike fonts.  Your guess is as good as mine what
    the name would be, because &#39;Fletch&#39; looks like it was a font name, but
    I can&#39;t find it any more. Something with &#39;F&#39;, would be my guess. <BR>
    <BR>&#40;Maybe it was pulled from circulation when the real Fletch font owner
    saw it?&#41;
