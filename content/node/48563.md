body: "Fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am in the rather unfortunate position of working
  with a client who had a rather \"young\" designer previously. As such I am stuck
  with a logo and collateral that uses a rather lousy typeface (Shalimar). The client
  is a large \"whole-health\" center, primarily for women. It was started by an OB/GYN
  and has grown to include an acupuncturist, a spa, a movement studio, chiropractor,
  massage, etc. \r\n\r\nI'll be doing some print collateral for them, and I was wondering
  if anyone folks had any suggestions about type. I think they are happy with Shalimar
  so I don't want to head in a totally different direction. I'm not totally getting
  an Eastern or Asian vibe from it, but I see how that maybe could. Either way, think
  along the lines of a Eastern feel with some flow to it. And, please, nothing terribly
  expensive, they are not going to want to pay a lot.\r\n\r\nAlso, since that would
  just be for display, I would welcome ideas for pairings to set the rest of the type/text
  in. I've have my ideas, but love to hear others. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I know
  there is a lot of bad type out there that looks like what I am asking for, hoping
  you all know of some good stuff."
