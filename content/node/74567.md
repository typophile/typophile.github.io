  else fed up with nearly every thread in the <em>Newest</em> section on the home
  page asking for type ID's (currently 7/10 entries are asking for ID's)? Is it time
  to take font ID's off the home page or is that too controversial?\r\n\r\nI need
  convincing that ID's <em>deserve</em> to be on the home page. Is this website the
  de facto online resource for having a font identified? If so is it time to hive
  off the font ID part and stick it somewhere else or will that make everyone very
  sad?"

    soonish) revised homepage, type ID requests could well deserve a dedicated spot."

  body: I hope it's a much smaller dedicated spot! Like a link to a different page
    altogether... what I don't like is the fact that a type ID request can quickly
    push a much more interesting thread off the homepage and interesting threads are
    hard to find unless they find you.

    dots, not a real font as far as I know.\r\n\r\nOr were you gently lulling me into
    turning this thread into a font ID request?"
