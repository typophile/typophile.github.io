  annual ATypI gathering in Lisbon, Portugal, and I'm looking for an accomodation
  solution for the nights of Tue, 26th september to Mon, 02 october.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nBest
  would apparently be to share a hotel room at the <a href=\"http://www.residencialflorescente.com/\">
  Residencial Florescente</a> which is half the price of the \"official\" hotel, and
  better located.\r\n\r\nSo if there is someone willing to type-talk and type-gossip
  :) for a week, you just have to know that I don't snore, easy to get along with
  (hope I got the translation right), speak French, English and German fluently, which
  might include jokes-handling :)\r\nOtherwise it turns out I'll be all alone in the
  big scary city\u2026\r\nAny help or tips appreciated!"
