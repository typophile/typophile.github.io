  with the way letters are harmed by the modern methods of producing raised letters
  in metal. &#40;I usually specify bronze, steel, or aluminum.&#41; Does anyone have
  advise about typefaces that stand up better than others? Are there any good foundries
  out there that cast plaques the old fashioned way?

  body: Thanks, Tiffany. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m attaching a jpeg image of a typical plaque.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve actually been doing a fair amount of research on this over the
    past several days, and I&#39;m learning that, as usual, you get what you pay for.  I
    have a budget for the simplest casting process, which gives you crudely cut letters
    and ornamental borders. <BR> <BR>Most commercial operations use a computer-driven
    process. They take my art, in the form of an eps file, and produce rubber a mold,
    which in turn replicates a negative image of my plaque in plaster. The molten
    bronze is poured into the plaster mold. Even  if I do a great job of the typography,
    this process forces a two dimensional object to live in three dimensions, and
    the results are dicey. <BR> <BR>To make it worse, in 3d, a letter needs &#34;draw,&#34;
    that is, seen in section, it has a bit of a slope on each side. This allows the
    casting to be separated from the mold after the bronze has hardened. The foundry
    sands the raised elements to a &#34;satin&#34; finish--but as they remove material,
    the letter forms get fat &amp; awkward. It&#39;s like applying a &#34;bold&#34;
    style in Word. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried to minimize the bad effects by using a
    robust sans serif font &#40;Syntax&#41;, which can stand up to some abuse. It&#39;s
    also possible to get better results by doing a chemical etch instead of a casting,
    but many of my clients expect a cast plaque. <BR> <BR>For about 3 times my per-plaque
    budget, good foundries will create a mold by hand and use some real artistry in
    shaping letters that are sculptural and quite beautiful. <BR> <BR>The question
    remains, though, are there any techniques out there that will let me improve the
    results without tripling my budget? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67459.jpg"

  body: Daniel, the boards are a little touchy. If you do send a post and receive
    an error the best thing to do, before you try posting again, is to refresh the
    page. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll take care of the duplicates. <BR> <BR>I wonder if using
    an unbracketed serif typeface, such as <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.11118.3.11&amp;attributes.sampleSize=48&amp;sampleText=AaBbCc+Handgloves&amp;sampleSize=288"
    target="_blank">Scala</a>, might be suited for this? I personally don&#39;t like
    Scala printed on high quality paper because it is just too crisp, it sparkles
    too much. However, I do like it printed on cheap paper as it softens it up a bit.
    I wonder .... Hmm.

  body: Daniel, could you show a nice close-up &#40;maybe by placing one of your plates
    directly on a flatbed scanner and making a hi-res image&#41; overlaid with the
    actual original letterforms? <BR> <BR>Maybe if we know exactly how the letterforms
    are being &#34;degraded&#34; by the process, we can figure out what [kinds of]
    fonts can survive it best - and quite possibly even <i>improve</i>. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'I second Hrant&#39;s suggestion: it would be good to get some close-up images
    of what happens to the letters in this casting process. Ideally, it would be good
    to have close-ups of the rubber and plaster molds too, so we can see to what degree
    the degradation is due to each stage of the process. One way to address &#39;crudely
    cut&#39; letters is to use letters that are deliberately &#39;crude&#39; in appearance
    &#40;although not crudely made&#41; such as Koch&#39;s Neuland, but stylistically
    this might not meet your needs.'

    have been good for: perhaps Chapparal MM. Alas, I pretty sure you can&#39;t buy
