  I've begun working on digitizing some calligraphic letterforms to build my first
  attempt at an OpenType font (for the moment this is just an experiment). So far
  I'm still roughing in the letterforms by tracing scans in Illustrator, cleaning
  up the drawings, drawing new/missing glyphs from scratch (that is, literally drawing
  them and then tracing in Illustrator), then bringing the vectors into FontLab, but
  this process has produced a wide range of node totals. In one glyph, for example,
  I might have 200 nodes (remember, these are calligraphic forms), while another might
  have 600.\r\n\r\nThis is producing far too much variation in the consistency of
  the vectors, not simply in terms of the amount of information, but the \"edges\"
  of the forms are, in some cases, far too \"rough/detailed.\" So, I've been cleaning
  them up by hand to get the balance I want from one glyph to the next.\r\n\r\nThat
  said, what I'm wondering is how many is too many nodes-per-glyph? At what point
  is the font going to get sluggish with too much information? For example, should
  I shoot for an average of 100, 200, 300 nodes?"

    usual, the ideal is to have as few nodes as are needed to draw the curve you wish.
    A swashy script will need far more than a geometric sans of course.\r\nI would
    rethink your \"draw in Illustrator first\" strategy. You would be beter off starting
    your tracing in FontLab and getting fewer bad and un wanted nodes. If you are
    starting off witha scan, maybe a first cut with ScanFont then reshaped in FontLab
    might be a better solution.  Illustrator does some things to curves that may work
    fine as an illustration but can cause trouble in a font.\r\n\r\nhttp://fontlab.com/Font-tools/ScanFont/\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    like 3000 curved nodes (the latter fonts choked up my font manager real good).
    A handful used an average of 500 <em>corner</em> nodes, and these load very quickly,
    so the straight lines definitely speed things up, but also make it ridiculous
    to print at large sizes where the corners become obvious.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm going
    to shoot for 200 curved nodes per glyph, giving myself license to go up to 300

  body: Tiff, unless I'm mistaken that's only true if each section is short and the
    angle of each corner slight (to create the effect of a curve). And, as above,
    there's the problem of using the font at larger sizes, which reveals the clunky
    "mock-curves." The face I'm working on is for display copy, likely to be used
    (if at all) for polymer letterpress printing at fairly large sizes (broadsheets),
    so I need/want a fluid, organic feel to the outlines.

    as many \"bumps\", just straight ones instead of curvy ones. But of course the

  body: "Hi Jason,\r\n\r\nLet me appologize in advance for the long post with hijack
    potential. I wanted to encourage you to keep going with your original process
    of drawing, scanning, and refining. This is a process that I have used and come
    to love. What follows is a journal entry of sorts, documenting my thinking on
    the font I'm currently working on ... eventually I hope to pair entries with samples
    in a *making of* format (but not in your thread :-).\r\n\r\n(my nodes average
    around 25-75 per glyph)\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>... While speed was the catalyst that
    sent me down this road, I've grown to love the process. Most *distressed* typefaces,
    by definition, start of as something clean. Some process is applied, and the result
    is a rough interpretation. The results tend to be static and lack an organic quality
    that I enjoy in a lively typeface. My process works in reverse, starting dirty
    and getting cleaner.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>I start with letters drawn as tightly
    as possible at about 1 cm cap height. The small scale allows me to work quickly,
    taking in character relationships at a glance. There's so much freedom when you
    can draw a complete alphabet in minutes. It also introduces a lot of distressing.
    You can only draw so cleanly at that size because of the ink, paper, and hand
    shakes. </cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>From here the work is refining the typically rough
    results scanned and imported into Fontlab. Proportions are generally good, but
    often need some adjustment. I find that organic quality not just in the letter
    shapes, but also in color variation within the set. With Olduvai, a serif type,
    there was very little color correction required. For my new sans though, there
    was a much lower tolerance for variation before the design just looked nasty.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>As
    I adjust the letters I'm reminded of the expressionist letters of Pressig. There
    is an approximation of curve, where the final curve is drawn in the eye of the
    user. I'm not saying that this is how one actually reads text set in the font,
    but that you need only suggest form instead of defining it. While he chose to
    use straight line segments, I enjoy even more flexibility using distorted bezier
    curves. It is a fantastic medium to work in, unconstrained by the ever present
    desire to define a precise shape with the fewest number of nodes.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    freedom dawned on me fully when I tried to make a *clean* version of Olduvai.
    It was nearly impossible to nail down the suggested shapes in a consistent fashion.
    One letter isn't a problem, but capturing the spirit across a full set proved
    frustrating. I empathized with designers who've tried to revive a metal face from
    rough letterpress samples. It surprised me though, because I had drawn the originals
    in the first place! There's something elusive about it, and I think that's the
    beauty of designing in the rough ...</cite>\r\n\r\nGO FOR IT!"

    process sounds similar, right up to the fact that I'm planning to attempt a \"clean\"
    redraw of the font after I get the \"rough\" version finished (there's still lots
    to do). I appreciate your warning about finding a balance in the clean redraw,
    as I'm anticipating the same challenge; the letterforms I'm working with are very
    independent, each with its own personality, so finding such a balance won't be
    easy. In the \"rough\" version this works fine, but I'm not sure how it might
    fit together as a \"clean\" font.\r\n\r\nAs for the tidying process, the tracing
    results I'm getting from Illustrator are good, but do, indeed, require a lot of
    fine tuning. After simplifying & hand-picking down from around 500-600 points,
    I'm averaging 200 nodes per glyph (ranging from 120-300), and the font will be
    for display purposes only, so the character set will be quite limited (it's an
    all-cap font, with full and small caps, old style numbers, punctuation & basic
    analphabetics), so I'm thinking it will still funciton well. Hrant's mention of
    older RIPs is something to consider, but at the moment I'm building this simply
    as an experiment. As mentioned in my post (linked above) there are larger issues
    at play if I were to ever consider releasing the font into the world."
