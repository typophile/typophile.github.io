body: i am looking for alternatives to this typeface ...  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/lassigue-dmato/"
  target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/lassigue-dmato/</a> ... something
  with just as much sex appeal and warmth ... not horror movie chilling, but more
  fine cabernet sauvignon, or something like that ... thank you for any suggestions

  body: Brian why can&#39;t you use Lassique if it is so close to what you want? I
    personally don&#39;t think Lassigue is sexy unless it is tied into Dracula and
    I guess I can see Dracula as sexy, but only if it is Stuart Townsend as Lestat.
    <BR> <BR>Allegheny is sorta close, more calligraphic though. &#40;see myfonts&#41;
    <BR>Mosh and Nars are sexy in that same vein--bad pun &#40;see myfonts&#41;
