		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I don&#39;t think the word design constitutes a &#39;value judgement&#39;. Design is an activity, or more accurately a collection of activities, and in my understanding this includes what might be termed micro-typographic aspects of &#39;mere typesetting&#39; such as the decision about how much space to put on between a letter and a following punctuation mark. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not keen on your term &#39;image&#39;, because it seems to overemphasise the whole to the detriment of a proper consideration of the parts. Again, this is not about value judgement, but whether one focuses on the product of typography as a key to its definition, or on the process of typography. Probably both approaches are valid. <BR> <BR>The idea of &#39;articulation of text&#39;, which is central to my working definition, does imply a value judgement, because it suggests a measure of the success of any piece of typography -- or act of typography, if I were really to stress the process -- relative to a text. This is why it is a <i>working</i> definition, and different from my simpler definition: design with type. The working definition tells you something about the kind of work I do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I agree with you that the word design does not literally constitute a value judgement. However, in practice much professional typography, especially at the high end, is done by &#40;graphic&#41; designers. So to use the term &#34;design&#34; in a definition is problematic -- it suggests that there is some aspect of professionalism involved, when that is not a prerequisite to making typography. <BR> <BR>I can see what you&#39;re getting at with &#34;articulation&#34;, but it&#39;s surely necessary to include the word &#34;image&#34;, because as it stands, your definition could equally apply to &#34;text to sound&#34;. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Generally, when I say text I mean something written. The idea of &#39;oral text&#39; is problematic in this regard, but can be ignored unless specifically talking about oral literature. I don&#39;t have much time for the more extreme post-modern thesis that anything can be regarded as a text, not least because it imposes an ideological primacy of writing that I think is wrong. <BR> <BR>However, in the interest of seeking a genuine synthesis of our ideas, I&#39;d happily include the word &#39;visual&#39; in my definition, e.g. &#39;The application of design to the visual articulation of text&#39;. Or, to simplify further, and remove that word design which is troubling you, one could forumulate a working definition of typography simply as &#39;the visual articulation of text&#39;. <BR> <BR>I dislike the term &#39;image&#39; because it suggests a visual whole which is presented &#39;all at once&#39; -- as a painting or a photograph -- and not a text, which is a thing that you move through temporally. The image of typography is its most superficial aspect. I also think there is a tyranny of the image in much contemporary design, especially in North America, and a corresponding lack of regard for text. This is evident from the pages of &#39;typography&#39; annuals, in which one sees few examples of type that is not sitting on top of or adjacent to a photograph, illustration, or other image, and usually subservient to it. This attitude has its ideological expression in Bruce Mau&#39;s statement &#39;Heaven is a place without text&#39;. Wanker. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I mentioned, &#39;articulation of text&#39; is a <i>working</i> definition, which doesn&#39;t claim to be exhaustive. I think it is appropriate to the majority of typographic work, and certainly to the kind that most interests me, but there are of course uses of type in which text is secondary to the overall image or, less often, in which text is not a factor at all. To encompass all this, a more general definition is necessary. <BR> <BR>As regards a definition of type, I think you would need to include the prefabricated and reusable nature of type that distinguishes it from chirography and other unique, manual expressions of written forms. At TypeCon last year, Allan Haley gave a talk on what he called &#39;non-font typography&#39;, by which he meant hand-lettering in a graphic design context. He showed some nice work by various people, but his terminology was a mess of misconceptions: hand-lettering is not typography, non-font or otherwise.</div>

Or more of a &#39;What typography means to me&#39; kind of a situation? Although, I suppose you can&#39;t really state them separately, as you&#39;ve seen so far. <BR> <BR>At its most basic, I&#39;d call it &#39;<i>the consideration and/ or appearance of typeset matter</i>&#39;. I mean, it&#39;s all there in the name. When I say &#39;appearance and/ or consideration&#39;, I&#39;m hitting on design&#39;s potential presence, but design is such a loaded word, I&#39;d be inclined towards a more neutral term, that also carries no value judgements &#40;sorry, John&#41;, because I believe that design implies intent. With modern &#39;typesetting&#39; being so automated, much of the process for amateurs contains no intent, but contains many defaults. Also, I&#39;m including the action and the thing itself. Typography can be good and bad, as in: &#34;Man, that typography sucks,&#34; which is not the action, but the result of it. Typography exists when type is present, but design exists only when it is exercised &#40;I know, this is debatable, but I&#39;m sticking to it for now.&#41;. <BR> <BR>But that basic definition can be taken as very inclusive or exclusive, depending on your opinions about: the role of the typesetter/ typographer vs. the role of the graphic designer &#40;or, typography vs. design&#41;. <BR> <BR>I can look at a poster that uses type as a purely visual element &#40;you might call it a typographic element&#41;, but that does not, in my mind, represent the result of typesetting &#40;typography&#41;. It&#39;s a typographic design, and in the sense that typographic elements exist there, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s typography as a manifestation of typesetting. See the problem? Type isn&#39;t only geometry, it&#39;s a set of symbolic glyphs. But, those glyphs only get meaning based on how they&#39;re treated. That&#39;s what makes &#40;in my mind&#41; the definition so potentially contentious. The intent of the typesetter/ designer/ artist and the end result affect the meaning of how typographic elements function in an individual situation, and whether it is typography or typographic. <BR> <BR>I think. ...I&#39;m starting to twist my thoughts a little too hard, but I believe this is a conceptually consistent post. But what better place to have this discussion than with Typophiles? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Having reread my post many hours later, I have to admit that I&#39;m not sure what <i>my own</i> point was &#40;I think there were a few, in fact&#41;. <BR> <BR>I meant it to bring up the differences between design and typography and how they merge and blend with type, largely because it carries meaning in such a unique fashion. And thus, the definition becomes loaded with potential meaning. But I don&#39;t think it went as well as I meant it to.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, <BR> <BR>I resemble that statement.  <BR> <BR>The problem is this Nick. You do indeed &#34;type&#34; but you do not typeset unless you are setting type. If it is not type, it is not typography. So I am in agreement. I was just trying to be kind. Never works for me. <BR> <BR>But let us examine first the non noun definition of type, or rather <i>to type.</i> <BR> <BR><b>Penguin:</b>  <i>To write something using a typewriter or computer.</i> <BR> <BR>Now that&#39;s pretty modern. At least the latter. <BR> <BR>However the noun <i>type.</i> <BR><b>Penguin:</b> <i>A small metal block with a raised character or letter on its upper surface, used in printing.</i> <BR> <BR>We are fooling ourselves to think otherwise. I am easily talked into that distinction. I am a typographer, even by Fournier&#39;s definition. <BR> <BR>This illustration is &#34;modernized&#34;. See Giampa. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/TypeStick.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/TypeStick.html</a> <BR> <BR>Setting. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/GiampaStick.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/GiampaStick.html</a> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/TypeSet.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/TypeSet.html</a> <BR> <BR>Printing. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/GiampaHat.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/GiampaHat.html</a> <BR> <BR>Designing. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/ATF.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/ATF.html</a> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/EzraPound.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/EzraPound.html</a> <BR> <BR>Publishing <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Robin-Blaser-Poet.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/Robin-Blaser-Poet.html</a> <BR> <BR>Type Founding <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/OrphanAnnie.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/OrphanAnnie.html</a> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/CaliforniaCase.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/CaliforniaCase.html</a> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/StonePattern.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/StonePattern.html</a> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/StoneRimmerFrame.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/StoneRimmerFrame.html</a> <BR> <BR>And running a business.
