  it\xB4s about a pairing between the sans serif [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/moretype/alwyn-new/|Alwyn]]
  and an yet unknown serif typeface. I have done some homework and checked out the
  usual suspects such as Bembo, Sabon, Caslon, Garamond etc. Caslon is best so far,
  but it's still a tad \"flowery\". I feel that the serif typeface should be toned
  down a bit so as not to compete too much with Alwyn.\r\n\r\nAny input would be most
  appreciated! :-)\r\n\r\nOwanomono\r\n\r\n"
