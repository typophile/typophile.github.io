  I have to say, I think this is the most unappealing thing I have seen in a long
  time, and I thought I'd throw it out there for y'all to critique. There is so much
  to hate about it, the colors, the awkwardness... I myself am not a designer, but
  I love design, and I love hearing the expertise of those in this forum, so I thought
  I'd throw it out there. \r\n\r\nHere are my questions... \r\n1. What do you think
  of this \"Diet Coke Plus\" look?\r\n2. What do you think was the \"look\" that Coke
  was going for in this thing (which I obviously missed) \r\n3. What would you suggest
  to Coke if they asked you? \r\n\r\nHave Fun. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dietcokeplusresized_4004.jpg]"

    doing with the Diet Coke brand.  They've been throwing so many variations out
    to the marketplace lately that I'm not sure I know what it stands for anymore.
    \ \r\n\r\nI don't think there's anything inherently wrong with the design itself.
