  Displaying titles like this seems a bit odd for this forum, instead of promoting
  the chosen typeface it would put me off buying it :|\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kern_4507.png]"

  body: I suspect that the problem is that the Flash application that creates the
    text does not kern. Flash is typographically challenged ... I can't even do a
    simple superscript in it. Hopefully now that Adobe is running things, it will
    be improved.

  body: I think that years of browsers not kerning have inured me to problems with
    web type.

  body: "Don, you are correct. Our Flash/Java presentation combo does not support
    kerning (it cannot be embedded into the SWF), which of course is a huge drawback.
    It becomes more apparent in some fonts than others.\r\n\r\nThere is no work around
    that I am aware of, but I still firmly believe that the ability to show any font
    dynamically is a huge win and still a rather unique method for showcasing new
    typefaces. I would hope that these kinds of drawbacks would not deter anyone from
    choosing this, or any other typeface we have shown. I think we can trust that
    the fine folks at Font Bureau know how to kern :)"

  body: "I sure hope someone figures a way to address this in online renderers, as
    they are the main marketing tool for my fonts. The MF beta still does not class-kern
    AFAIK, and I wonder how many potential customers look at the display and think
    that I did not bother kerning my fonts.\r\n\r\nLOL, Nick. So \"Typography\", \"Typophile\"
    and anything else wih \"Ty\" (or \"To\"), etc. is out. So is \"Kerning\" (I get
    carried away, sorry)."

  body: Fonts embedded in Flash Player 10 are now kernable, so hopefully when FP10
    becomes more ubiquitous we will see updates to engines like sIFR.
