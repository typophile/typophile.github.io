		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I think so. Minion MM back in 1991 (which also predates ITC Bodoni). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, it all depends on what you mean by optical sizes. I suspect that Minion MM was the first digital typeface to have the full range of characters in a range of optical sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, some degree of optical size variation had been done even earlier than this. Adobe Garamond, for instance, had an all caps titling face back in 1989. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, Adobe Garamond was a revival. But I see the question of revivals versus originals as rather orthogonal to the question of optical size variation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, I've been waiting for Hrant to raise his objection about the dysfunction of upright italics again. I've now read two books set in Martin Majoor's Seria, both using the upright italic for emphasis etc. and I didn't find any problem with it at all. I read the books and my brain processed the italics as italics. I don't think one can form a general rule from this that upright italics are always going to function as well as slanted ones &ndash; surely this depends on the individual design &ndash;, but equally one shouldn't denounce upright italics as dysfunctional on a theoretical basis. Go read a book that uses them. Further evidence that our reading ability is good enough to handle most of what we typically throw at it and then some.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I didn't try to 'gauge my own immersive reading', I just read the bloody books. I read them like any other book, and the italics functioned like any other italics: they did their job, they typographically signalled information about the text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[If anything, being a type designer is more likely to be an impediment to comfortable immersive reading of things like upright italics: it makes one more likely to notice something unusual and out of the ordinary. Being a type designer is something one overcomes in order to be a reader.] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I disagree with you because I disagree with what you say, not because you're the one saying it. I'm not about the run out and start designing upright italics, because I do think that there is a net benefit to slant: a compound differentiation of letterform and slant  is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> effective than a single differentiation of letterform (upright italic) or slant (sloped roman). I also agree that slant generally makes for greater differentiation than letterform. Where I disagree is in how great the differentiation actually needs to be for successful reading: I think a well designed upright italic can be perfectly sufficient in this regard and that slant, while desirable, is far from necessary. I do not think slant is even the 'central attribute of an italic': the central attribute is sufficient differentiation from the roman, however that is achieved.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, the point is that while you were bloody reading you don't know if you missed any emphasized words because they were not distinctive enough because there was no slant. Consider the &quot;I&quot; for example. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And you can't overcome being a type designer. If you did you couldn't design type any more. Being type designers make us a bad benchmark for readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slant is central to an italic because it's the thing that determines what else <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be needed to pull it sufficiently away from the Roman, and only if the slant isn't strong enough. Slant is also central because it's the only attribute that's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->required<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for an italic to work well in an emphatic role. The other attributes are basically aesthetic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not saying all an italic should have is slant, but what I'm saying is that slant is a necessary condition - while cursiveness for example is not. So a slanted-Roman is less bad than an upright italic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Which Gerald? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lange. Although I certainly remember you talking about Kingsley as well - I'm still waiting for the goods! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, the parallels between music and type are seriously over-rated. Massively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But anyway, I didn't say that type designers have &quot;no idea&quot; what their designs look like, just that their consciousness filters things more -and in different ways- on their way &quot;down&quot; to the subconscious. This should be pretty obvious. This is why evaluating a text font by merely reading it is not enough. And there's another reason: a font contains many more glyphs than are encountered in any reading session. So reading provides &quot;deterministic&quot; evaluation, but not &quot;mathemetical&quot; evaluation: for the latter you have to look at each glyph in the font, which is something that doesn't happen in reading. For example, a font can have a wonderful alphanumeric set, but a lousy eszet - and few people will ever realize. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some more thoughts about upright italics: the chances that an emphasized word will be noticed is proportional to the length of the word (among other things). We might agree that single-letter words are highly problematic for an upright italic, but there are only two of those in English, and one of them (&quot;a&quot;) has a structurally different form in cursive, so it's not disasterous (although I might doubt the ability of a reader to appreciate the difference [enough] during immersive reading). And I might further concede that three-letter words are pretty safe. But in English two-letter words are about 20% of text! And I think that's a notable problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
