body: "I found this slab serif font at the American Museum of Natural History in New
  York.  It looks pretty similar to some of the standard slab serifs, like Rockwell,
  but doesn't match perfectly.  \r\n\r\nNote the distinctive lowercase g on the bottom
  edge of the photo.  \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n"
