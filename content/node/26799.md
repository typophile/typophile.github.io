  body: ' Even worse than Helvetica Grotesque is AVANT GARDE. Talk about cringe-inducing.
    A client brought me a literary magazine last week...80 pages set ENTIRELY in Avant
    Garde. This atrocity gives a new meaning to &#39;Grotesque&#39; fonts...I wouldn&#39;t
    use it to typeset a laundry receipt, much less a literary magazine. '

  body: ' &#34;Helvetica Flair&#34; reminded me of another one of the all-time worst
    fonts: HARLOW. You see it all the time on &#39;70s graphics, apparently because
    idiot designers decided that it somehow evoked the &#39;20s and &#39;30s, and
    stuck it all over things like album covers for old music. Of course, it looked
    &#42;nothing&#42; like any font you&#39;d actually see from the &#39;20s and &#39;30s
    - typesetters had far better taste then...fortunately it&#39;s decreased in popularity
    in recent years. '

  body: 'I agree with Jay on the Modernism/Post-Modernism issue. One problem I think
    you have with this discussion is the deffinition of those two movements. They
    are so broad, and so contemporary that it is hard to define one or the other,
    and therefor difficult to talk about them being very different. I might argue
    that Post-Modernism is really just that, something tacked on to modernism. The
    philosophy is based on the same theory, in PM  it has been taken to the next logical,
    or illogical step as the artist dictates in PM. Modersim is alive and well. Much
    of the theory and ideas that grew out of early modernism has yet to be explored
    fully, and so much of post-modernism is merely an exploration of the original
    Modernist theory.  <BR> <BR>What I am really trying to say is that they are two
    sides of the same coin. Now if you disagree you may be talking about something
    completely different than what I am referring to. Becuse, like I said before,
    the two names are so encomassing that without a clear deffinition it is impossible
    to understand what we are talking about. '

  body: Hey Jay, do you teach at art center, or are you not good enough for that?
    <BR>Maybe you have to run your class somewhere that only attracts low quality
    teachers <BR>What&#39;s your rank and classification?

  body: i&#39;ve just spent the last 25 minutes of my life hearing about how wonderful
    art center is and the rebuttle that it is not a well rounded school.  my imediate
    question to all is who cares about where anyone got there education... as long
    as you kick a-- and your passion exceeds your ego.   <BR>  i&#39;ve attended a
    few art colleges and learned that self growth is limitless and to surround yourself
    with others that have these ideals in mind is keen.   <BR>  please lets change
    the &#34;thread&#34;  to something benefitial to all.  <BR> <BR> thanks \ <BR>ek
