body: I'm a new member of this forum, and I was just looking for some input from some
  professional designers. I was wondering what the most important (or top three, if
  you're indecisive) skill one would look for in a junior designer? Also wandering
  what some of the most important things you all have picked up on your way to becoming
  such stunning pros. Anyways, just throwing this out there. Thanks! Glad to be here.
