body: "Really similar to FF DIN in terms of feel. But I like the proportions of this
  unknown typeface a lot more. I tried contacting the designer but have not received
  a reply yet. Hopefully you guys can help me.\r\n\r\nClosest typeface I found is
  Vaud but there's a couple of notable differences (the '3' and the ampersand). I
  included a large sample of the typeface being used. Take note of the lowercase 'y'
  since the short stroke is not completely flush with the long stroke at the connecting
  point (which I think is a beautiful little detail). Also, there is an angled cut
  on the top of the lowercase 't' (similarly to Vaud). The ampersand is traditional,
  has an open gap at the top (also shown in the image).\r\n\r\nI hope the image I've
  made provides enough context and samples so that I can finally find this typeface.
  All the font identifier websites that I've used have not solved this for me (whatthefont,
  whatfontis, etc.).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to everyone that will help."
