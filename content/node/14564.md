  of Hiragino Mincho Pro that they can license for the PC. It comes with Mac OS X,
  but that doesn't help me, since I assume the license won't permit me to just email
  them the OT fonts, even thought it would be really easy and I got them for free.\r\n\r\nGrrr.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know where this font (both weights: W3 + W6) are available? The person using
  them is a native Japanese speaker, so Japanese sites are fine."

    this. The stock plussed 4.80% today\u2026 ; )"

    more sense for this font to be available cross-platform? Legally?"

    be looking for a freebee, I wish I could help, but I'm useless when it comes to
    PC fonts.

  body: "Chris, you might be in luck! Hiragino Mincho Pro was not designed in Cupertino
    by Apple. They licensed it. Maybe the company they licensed it from will license
    you a PC version?\r\n\r\nSome designer/distribution info is embedded in the font
    (I viewed this information with Linotype's FontExplorer X utility, which will
    be publicly available soon):\r\n\r\nThe font was designed by JIYUKOBO Ltd.\r\nTheir
    URL is http://www.jiyu-kobo.co.jp/\r\nThe font's manufacturer/distributor is Dainippon
    Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd.\r\nTheir URL is http://www.screen.co.jp/font/\r\n\r\nHiragino
    is a trademark of Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. registered in Japan.\r\n\r\nDainippon
    Screen's site is all in Japanese. But maybe you can find an e-mail link?"
