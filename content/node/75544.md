  Horn in Iowa.  The city has the largest percentage population of Danish residents
  in America. It also boasts the only Danish windmill to ever leave Denmark.  \r\n\r\nOur
  group has only just started the ideation and conceptualizing a series of symbols
  and color schemes to represent the town.\r\n\r\nWe are searching for possible typeface
  solutions to use throughout the signage for the town. \r\n\r\nIn our research we
  came up with these two typefaces being used as signage in Europe. I think the team
  overall appreciates the large x-height and overall verticality.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  can identify these typefaces or point me in the direction of any alternatives that
  would be great."
