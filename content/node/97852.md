  use of 2 fonts. Could anyone help me id-ing both the title font and the font used
  for the headers.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "The masthead is probably custom, the bold headlines handwritten (cf. the
    different \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018N\u2019 glyphs in \u2018HALINA REIJN\u2019).
    The condensed headline seems to be a font, but it\u2019s likely to be exclusive.

    Lubalin monogram]], one of his numbering letterings. And I guess you're right
    for Bookman Swash, probably a good alternative to work on. I strongly encourage
    you to have a look to Mark Simonson's fantastic revival of Bookman called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/|Bookmania]],
    full of swashes (680!) and alternate characters.

  body: "Thanks Ryuk! Really cool monogram.\r\nThanks for yor lead on Bookmania. Do
    you have any other recommandations on cool script fonts or how to create swashes.
    Are they all handmade?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to post on the ID-Board for days, but
    can't seem to get through. Internal server errors all the time. I've contacted
    Typophile, but no respons so far. Are you aware of any technical problems?"
