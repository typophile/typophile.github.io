  on the Mac to output PDF files using dobe Garamond Premier Pro 12pt as my chosen
  font. However, in instances where the character 'f' is the last character on the
  line of justified text, it looks clipped. Does anyone know why this would be happening?\r\n\r\nKind
  Regards"

  body: "Apparently, Scrivener is masking the text area when it creates the PDF. The
    top of the \"f\" extends outside the character bounding box (many do) and consequently
    gets cut off by the mask when it's at the edge of the text area.\r\n\r\nI can't
    think of a workaround (other than using a different font). I would say this may
    a problem with Scrivener and you should contact the developer. It's also possible
    that it's something inherent in the PDF writer in OS X. If it does the same thing
    in either Text Edit or Pages, that might be the case."

    is not true as far as I know. Can you cite specific glyphs? Which font did you
    look at?"

    in mind that in a design like this, there will always be outlines that do not

  body: Perhaps because I have spent the better part of the last three months updating
    my entire product line, I have become a little obsessive-compulsive about extrema.
    Nonetheless, I find it odd that, if you can achieve precisely the same results
    by following the conventions strictly, one would choose not to.

    not odd when you consider the extent of work required to address it, and the resulting
    benefit.\r\n\r\nAs someone who participated in the production work on Garamond
    Premier, I can tell you that it was a massive undertaking -- a large glyph complement
    in eight separate multiple master fonts. It is easy to ask that outlines simply
    be designed \"right\" in the first place, to avoid time-consuming outline futzing
    later, but it's simply not compelling when the resulting problems are negligible
    (or non-existent). Believe me, various people in the Type group here have probably
    been conscious of it since Day 1 of PostScript. Over the years, we have come to
    realize that it's just not a significant problem and \"choose our battles\" accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen
    a designer (Robert Slimbach, in this case) is confronting such a massive undertaking,
    one finds that it's better to simply allow the outlines to be produced in whatever
    way comes naturally to the designer, rather than fixate on details that are of
    little consequence. Of course, Robert understands as well as anyone the importance
    of points at extrema where it will have an impact on rasterization, and is, IMO,
    very good at putting points in the right places. If I was receiving outlines that
    were truly horrible, of course it would be worthwhile to offer the designer some
    guidance.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to sound pompous about it... just conveying a bit
    of font <em>realpolitik</em> from my perspective."

  body: "Most of what is being talked about is the curve positioning at cups of serifs
    or other tight turns. These kinds of things don't impact hinting and make the
    curve easier to draw with fewer points. You can extend the handle as a smooth
    point out from that curve section and still have enough tension to smooth that
    curve without having to add another point in such close proximity. Smooth Points
    in close proximity have limits on handle placement within the UPM grid thereby
    kinking the curve to force the handle to end at a UPM raster intersection.\r\n\r\nBelieve
    me, it is the best way out of a sticky wicket. Slimbach has his sh*t together
    when it comes to this.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    to edit with proper extrema. And, again FWIW, here's the sum total of the difference
    (using Photoshop's Difference blending) between the two versions I showed earlier
    at approximately 1200 points. I only tried to match the upper part of the curve;
    I am reasonably confident that I could have matched the lower part, had I addressed
    it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/difference_4938.jpg]"
