body: Well, it has now been nearly two months since I signed up and paid my $40. I
  checked my credit card statement, and there it is on 2 February. I had one email
  with the powers that be, but so far, I&#39;m not uppercase and can&#39;t access
  that forum, etc. Please help.

    for Uppercase access.

    out, sort of. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve sent a couple of e-mails as well.

    identified as a lowly &#39;Typophile Regular&#39;.

    and haven&#39;t had a chance to send out premiums. Plus, you know, work and kids
    and other distractions like that.'

  body: I&#39;m trying to be patient, but it&#39;s now 2.5 months, and so far nothing.
    I even signed up at the UC Plus level to give a little extra. I got an email saying
    it would be taken care of, but it hasn&#39;t been. Sigh.

    February&#41; but have not heard either. It took at least that long last year
    as well for premiums to appear.  Don&#39;t lose faith, it will happen. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    as long as it takes to become a Swash Cap. It&#39;s so exclusive. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    where all the secrets are.

  body: Chris, I realize they are volunteers, and I don&#39;t mind at all that I don&#39;t
    have my t-shirts.  <BR> <BR>However, I don&#39;t see why it should take 10 weeks
    to give me access to the UC forum, and replace &#34;Typophile Regular&#34; with
    &#34;Uppercase&#34; above my picture as recognition that I parted with $40 to
    support the cause.
