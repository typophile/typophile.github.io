  how the perception of Halloween has changed. My mother was really into the holiday
  and we would go to great measures to make a spooky fun place for the kids and the
  adults. One thing we would do is put fish nets hanging from the ceiling of the dinning
  room and put streamers draped through the holes. This gave the room the look of
  a magical forest. We also always had hot chocolate and apple cider for the adults
  who were almost always outside and never invited into a house. Not at my mothers
  place, the parents were incouraged to come in and enjoy the event. We would get
  hundreds of visitors when some neighbors would only get a few. A fun time."

    isn't much of a party planner, and the same goes for me. But recently, I've begun
    to feel excited again about putting on a costume. If people are planning to dress
    up, I want to know what everyone's costumes are!"

  body: Well in England Halloween is a pain. The trick treat knockers are usually
    older and scary they come a day too early. I had a girl come to my door on Oct
    30 and say trick or treat. She was about 16. I looked at her and said 'you're
    a day early'. She said 'it's my religion.' and then I said 'go back to school,
    it's tomorrow' and shut the door. Other years if you were home and didn't answer
    the door you will get you door egged!!!! And It is very hard to get dry egg off
    a wood door...I now hate this commercial American crap holiday. It use to be fun.

    Village here the gay community puts up an amazing parade for the event. In general
    in Manhattan its a non-event for children. I hope they still tricker-treat in
    the burbs, much like caroling at Christmas.

    Major's leadership (I moved in 1997). They also have three Starbucks in Leicester!
    But that's another story. \r\n\r\nAs I will never be able to afford to move back

    receiving candy. This is how I celebrated the holiday all through childhood, and
    would begin thinking of the perfect joke the first of October.\r\nYears later,
    I moved to Lawrence, Kansas. When Hallowe'en came, I was excited to have the holiday
    in this new town. I got everything ready for kids to come to the door, and when
    the bell rang with the first trick-or-treater, I opened the door eagerly.\r\n\"Trick
    or treat...\" the four year old said, with trepidation.\r\n\"What's your trick?\"
    I asked, expectantly.\r\n\"Huh?\" he replied.\r\n\"Do you have a joke or something?\"
    I encouraged.\r\n\"No...\"\r\n\"Well, you have to tell me a joke or it's just
    begging,\"\r\n\r\nThe kid started to cry.\r\n\r\nNo other kids had jokes that
    night, either.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until the next day that I related the story to
    friends and was informed that the St. Louis tradition of telling jokes or doing
    tricks wasn't practiced in Kansas. Or in any other city I've lived in since. Very
    disappointing."
