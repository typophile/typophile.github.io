  gurus here at typophile.\r\n\r\nIt's a novel length fantasy - 600+ pages - and it
  needs designed.\r\n\r\nThings to keep in mind:\r\nThere are to be two versions of
  the book - one to be read and one to be looked at (it's a self-aware object \u2014
  also read as: deluxe edition)\r\nThe book (text) is about the book (object) and
  its writer.\r\nMoreover, the book spans from about 400 B.C. to the 1960s. \r\nFinally,
  the pen \"writing\" the book was stolen from the book of fate and is writing in
  its own distinctive hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been struggling with font choices. I normally
  use a historically appropriate family and run with it. In order to do so on this
  project, I'd need a timeless or better yet, an immortal font.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting
  concept and I thought I'd throw it out into the forums. Would a full-out calligraphic
  solution be appropriate for the object? If so, what would the \"readable\" book
  be set in to coordinate? The book not only spans centuries, but also jumps from
  continent to continent, making references to many of the greatest civilizations
  in history. An entire chapter could be set in Chinese in the object and it would
  be correct... but should it be? In short, I have so many options that my head is
  spinning.\r\n\r\nWhat would you do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    She believes I can give it the care it deserves since I've seen her working at

    for her own library and for her friends/family/colleagues... while she's trying
    to get it published. \r\n\r\nShe's worried that it's too much of an artist book
    to ever get picked up by a publisher and that even if it does get picked up that
    it would become just another paperback on the fiction shelf. She wants it to be
    thoughtful and special. And since I owe her big-time, I'm I'm willing to do whatever
    I have to, to make this project really fantastic.\r\n\r\nDoes that help at all? "

    to be annoying and an impediment to the enjoyment of the book as literature. I
    could imagine a deluxe edition with plates depicting the manuscript as it evolved

    And Univers would clearly be the exact opposite of what you want.\r\n\r\nI would
    say that one might sort of squeak by with, say, Caledonia or Garamond. A typographer
    would peg them to a particular era, but they don't strongly suggest a particular
    era to the general reader. But I'm pretty sure you want something a bit less ordinary
    than this. (Weiss Roman and Palatino are a notch more decorative, still not heavily
    temporalized, but they're still fairly routine as well.)\r\n\r\nThe suggestions
    so far given here are excellent ones, but if you want to use a typeface that is
    more conventional than a calligraphic one... then, although Cloister Lightface
    or Jenson is not feasible (great for a deluxe edition of something like <em>Lord
    of the Rings</em>, yes, but not this) I think the closely related typeface Centaur
    might do very nicely."

    the kitch pitfall is definitely present. \r\n\r\nA few \"object\" faces that come
    to mind: Trinit\xE9, Brioso and Maiola. I also second Beorcana. Of these, Trinit\xE9
    is perhaps best suited to handle both the \"book\" and the \"object\", with it's
    variants - no. 4 italic for the most extreme. With Brioso, there's the obvious
    pair Kazuraki for Hiragana, Katakana and quite a bit of Kanji (I'm no expert on
    Chinese, but I seem to remember that they share at least the Kanji signs with
    the Japanese)."

  body: Caslon crossed my mind, but it doesn't seem timeless to me (despite having
    letter forms many will view as canonical)... although that depends on the version.
    If one is using all caps, tightly spaced, to advertise a bird calling contest,
    it can be timeless. So I also rejected Baskerville. And Andromache imitates a
    particular old Greek typeface - plus having inadequate legibility for a whole
    book, in my opinion.

  body: "That's strange that Brioso was mentioned. \r\nI've used it a few times with
    some success professionally - pairing it with Kanji (Japanese). Brioso was my
    first thought for the object version, but I didn't think anyone else would read
    it for 600 pages. I've been fond of that family since it first came out, but I
    always had a little guilt attached to using it. \r\n\r\nI think I'm going to try
    the first 20 or so pages in Brioso, Trinit\xE9 and Beorcana respectively - I think
    those will fit the \"object\" version very well.  \r\n\r\nNow for the \"readable\"
    version... I think that frode frank is absolutely right in that Trinit\xE9 can
    stand up to both versions, but I worry for Brioso and Beorcana. Centaur, Caslon,
    and Catull and Garamond are the forerunners for the readable - I'd be interested
    to hear what pairings everyone here would suggest.\r\n\r\nThis thread has been
    incredibly helpful - thanks again!"

    I was always quick to label - humanist, old style, transitional, slab - use what
    is appropriate to the project. (and normally what falls under the company standards).
    This has been an opportunity to look at fonts that rather blur the edges of the
    categories I've been a little too tight with - at least in the object version.
