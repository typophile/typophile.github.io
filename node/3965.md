  body: I&#39;ve decided that I haven&#39;t been clear enough about my request for
    feedback. The project is open somewhat, but we are interested in how individuals
    choose typefaces to portray ethnicity &#40;i.e.the chinese restaurant&#41; and
    the stereotyping that ensues from such choices. Which typefaces are particularly
    prone to stereotyping, why are they created and who uses them?  There are often
    questions on this forum about choosing typefaces for a particular ethnic or historical
    usage..what is your favorite-or most despised? <BR>I didn&#39;t want to be too
    specific becuase we are open to seeing where the discussion leads. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for any info... <BR> <BR>Deb <BR>

  body: 'One thing to realize is that the propensity for stereotypification &#40;?
    :-&#41; of a font seems to be proportional to its inappropriateness for setting
    long text. The more literalyl evocative a font &#40;like that &#34;chop suey&#34;
    abomination&#41;, the more laymen will be attracted to using it prominently. <BR>
    <BR>Most despised? My kind of angle!  :-&#41; <BR>I have to say I hate seeing
    Lithos used for conveying &#34;primitive&#34;. Koch&#39;s Neuland &#40;which by
    all accounts was conceived as a Teutonic font&#41; is [also] used a lot for African
    &#34;atmosphere&#34;, but for some reason that seems to make sense to me. Maybe
    it&#39;s because I like Neuland while I can&#39;t stand Lithos. People should
    really start using Skia &#40;more intelligently&#41; instead. <BR> <BR>BTW, trivia
    question: what&#39;s a font that&#39;s a cross between Skia and Copperplate? <BR>&#40;Paul

    must be one of the toughest jobs ever. <BR>This reminds me of <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/9195.html"

    a bit taken aback by the concept <BR>of &#34;maiming&#34; a typeface in order
    to achieve this  effect,  <BR>after a while I started to see the merits of such
    a solution. <BR>It allows you to refer to, without resorting to the obvious  <BR>stereotypes.

    think it&#39;s just a matter of subtlety. The tricks in Kanban might actually
    work OK if they were 90% more subtle. For example two fonts that seem nicely Far
    Eastern to me are Hiroshige and Octavian&#39;s Italic. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, Yves,
    it&#39;s great to see you spending some time outside of the ID forum.&#41; <BR>
