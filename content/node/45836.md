body: I've created a couple logo's for my company and wondered if anyone had an opinion

  body: they're actually not even logo's, are they?  I've been kicking around a few
    ideas, but haven't implemented one.  I've been pretty bummed cause I paid a few
    different people/co's over the past 3,4 years to come up with something, and after
    paying for the comps i end up using my own stuff anyway.  some have been quite
    expensive and it's been a real bummer.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AV_v2(25)_5685.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/AVGIRL(50)_6612.jpg]

  body: "these concepts feel like they're going in too many different directions right
    now.\r\n\r\nWhat is your company?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does your Company do?\r\n\r\n\r\nWho
    is the target market for your company?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is your logo going to
    be seen, and at what size?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer those questions and maybe
    we can try to figure something out - right now I know NOTHING about your company,
    even after seeing these logos.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot you can do here, the letters
    in the name can certainly be worked with, I think the biggest issue isn't picking
    one from a bunch, but knowing what it is you're looking for and why.\r\n\r\nI'll
    be checking back later\u2026"

  body: "Well, I'm hoping that your logo work will also include a website.  Based
    on the look of your current website, I would not buy equipment from you or trust
    you to do quality work in my home.  Your website does not inspire confidence in
    your product.  And the light-speed slideshow you have of the logos of the products
    you sell is unnerving.\r\n\r\nThe treatments you posted originally are, in fact,
    a type of logo: they're logotypes.  Other companies have done logotypes successfully:
    think 3M or Fedex.  \r\n\r\nGive up on the top and middle ones.  The bottom one
    has promise and you should consider staying with it.  That's Gill Sans?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

  body: "Yeah the bottom one has potential. I do not like the A and V together. The
    top of the 'A' is too flat in comparison with the bottom of the 'V'. There should
    be symmetry.\r\nI would also make the letters more uniform in width in the 'INTEL'
    part. The 'E' and 'L' look to narrow for the 'N' and 'T'.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.
    \r\n\r\nBTW: Your website really functions on no level for me too. You would be
    better served WITHOUT that online than with. Seriously consider a professional
    re-design. "

  body: "I apprec. the advice.  I am definately getting the website re-done.  I was
    just messing with it myself to learn the differences between zencart, magento,
    etc. etc.\r\n\r\nAnd to also learn what terms mean so I have a better understanding
    of finding a quality programmer/designer.\r\n\r\nIt has been a long haul.  Same
    as the logo.  Anybody want to help me find a designer that could do some really
    great work on my logo that wont cost me a fortune?  this was just my masters thesis
    project at marshall(usc), but has turned into a business."
