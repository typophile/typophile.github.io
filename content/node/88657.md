  typography equivalent of asking an older brother how to kiss girls, so if you're
  in the mood to open up perhaps this will sate that.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity: what
  brings you to buying a typeface? As in: at what point are you pulling out the credit
  card to enter it into the necessary fields? Particularly something that would be
  considered pricey for us who aren't on the end of our salary spectrums.\r\n\r\nRecently,
  my design work has all but stagnated and I've been biting at the heel to purchase
  a typeface. I could use a bigger library to bolster my work. I think it's only natural\u2014typefaces
  to graphic designers are like paints to a painter (or brushes, perhaps?) But you
  see: I consider myself an extremely frugal person and the idea of purchasing a typeface
  hits me hard. Yes, I know I spent lots of money for other IP\u2014such as the Creative
  Suite\u2014but I've never purchased a typeface and am quite afraid that once I do
  it will sit there unused and unloved for all eternity. Or perhaps I am simply worried
  it will become useless the moment I realize no client wants it.\r\n\r\nSo I'm just
  interested in your consumer process when it comes to type: is there a tipping point?
  Are you impulse buyers or is every font purchased a carefully budgeted and planned
  experience? "

  body: "This is a really interesting question.\r\n\r\nI buy two types of faces: workhorse
    fonts that I know I will use a lot, and specific one-purpose fonts for a specific
    project. In theory, I don't anticipate using the latter group ever again after
    the project is complete, although of course I always do.\r\n\r\nI, too, am also
    very frugal. I rarely buy fonts at all. I have, in fact, very few good ones. Typefaces
    are very expensive, especially for a freelancer, as they have to come out of my
    profit. So I have to choose very carefully.\r\n\r\nWith general-purpose serifed
    text faces, I want, when possible, to purchase the whole family: Roman and italic
    in all optical sizes. (I almost never need bold or any weight other than regular,
    and I never need condensed or expanded versions. But if you're going to buy that
    much of the family, it's usually cost effective to get the whole thing. And sometimes
    the weights come in handy.) So every couple of years I will buy a new text family.
    And then I will basically use it all the time for a few years, until I really
    know it in and out, before getting another one. I stuck with Minion for three
    or four years; it was one of my first. It took me a long time to get bored with
    it. I don't usually buy text faces for specific projects, both because of the
    cost and also because at this point I probably own something that works.\r\n\r\nDisplay
    faces are usually much less expensive, and I buy them more on a whim. Recently
    I bought two Laura Worthington faces just for fun, because they looked like they'd
    be a lot of fun to play with and they were very affordable.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer,
    at what point do I know I'm buying a typeface....\r\n\r\nFor a text family, I
    have to fall in love with it, and stay in love with it for a long time before
    I buy it. I admired Brioso Pro from afar for years before I finally ended up with
    two or three simultaneous projects where I knew it was perfect for all of them,
    and then I really had an impetus to buy it. I guess, I need to know in every case
    what I'll be using the font for, but if it's a text family = expensive, it usually
    takes a lot longer for me to get around to buying it. There are still plenty of
    text faces \u2014 Dolly, Quadraat, Seria, Rialto \u2014 that I think are beautiful
    and would love to have, but I know I'm not going to get them until I really have
    a project that needs them.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?\r\n\r\nEDIT: You know, my advice
    to you might be to just go find a font you like, one that's not too expensive,
    and just buy it. Play with it. Don't worry if you have a use for it. It might
    be fun to just jump in.\r\n\r\nEDIT again: I don't have an older brother, so I
    missed out on the kissing talk."

    I do feel your pain in a broader sense, since \"frugal\" is in\r\nfact a big understatement

    I would say I\u2019m an impulse buyer but mostly only get a few single fonts if
    the family is big and expensive. This turned out to be the most practical way
    over the years for you can build up a reasonable palette which works great for
    jobbing type kind of jobs and in case you want to use the typeface for complex
    design work you can get more weights and styles as you need them. This is specially
    handy with type foundries who offer an obliging update policy where your earlier
    purchase is credited when you license the whole family later, e.g. Process Type
    Foundry."

    family, I have to fall in love with it, and stay in love with it for a long time
    before I buy it. </cite>\r\n\r\nI believe that the price for a single weight is
    reasonable on average. The issue always becomes buying the entire family. I think
    we as a society are built up to believe that one we buy one thing, we should make
    it perfect by accessorizing and that's where I can see some of the difficulties.
    I can't just live with a single weight, because what good would a single weight
    do?\r\n\r\n<cite>EDIT again: I don't have an older brother, so I missed out on

  body: "I never thought of it as an issue of impulse vs. careful planning.\r\nIf
    there was a typeface that I thought would enable me to create an appropriate setting
    for a particular job, then I bought it.\r\nThe operative word being \u201Ccreate\u201D,
    because you don\u2019t know what kind of results working with a particular type
    will produce until you try, you only have a vague and unrealized idea. \r\n\r\nYou
    have to choose something you feel an affinity for, which suggests it might help
    you materialize an idea or effect you\u2019re working towards, which you feel
    will flesh out the design brief in a way that your bundled fonts won\u2019t.\r\n\r\nSo
    there is a trade-off between the possibility that the type you license may not
    work out for you or the client, vs. the possibility that if you don\u2019t try
    working with new tools, you will, as you suspect, stagnate."

    Nick my mother said the exact same thing when I consulted her on this issue. She
    is a small business owner and understands putting down the money for something
    that furthers the business as a necessity. If you need it: pay first, ask questions
    later.\r\n\r\nBut you must understand that I am caught in between that world and
    another. This other world is the philosophy of producing something very great
    from very little; that whole \"humble roots\" spiel, if you will.  As an example,
    a typeface I've lusted for is over at [[vllg.com|vllg]]. It is a workhorse serif
    and I think to myself, whilst looking at the price tag: \"Maybe I'm being irresponsible
    and maybe I can do everything I need to do with Minion and Century. Maybe my inability
    to produce a creative solution is my <em>own</em> problem and not a lack of assets.\"\r\n\r\nUltimately,
    however, I think as a young designer I still am learning that this profession
    requires we put money into it at various points. Some do it frequently while others
    do it infrequently. Eventually I'll find my sweet spot.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time,
    however, I've since purchased [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/|Gibson]]
    from Canada Type. My experience with it has been delightful, so that's a good
    start."
