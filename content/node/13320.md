  upper and lowercase, maybe an italic even... I know such exists because I've seen
  it published.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/015600884X/ref=sib_rdr_bc/002-7276261-0092030?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p=S008&j=1#reader-page\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/015600884X/ref=sib_rdr_zmin/002-7276261-0092030?p=S002&j=1#reader-page\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n-obsolete"

  body: I don't think so. There are cap and small cap Neuland characters, but the
    upper- and lowercase version looks very Kabel-like to me.

  body: "Koch's original meta Neuland for the Klingspor foundry was unicase. There
    was no lowercase. Modern digitations' small caps are just reduced caps designs.\r\n\r\nThe
    original Neuland's letters varied from point size to point size, but none of them
    were lowercase.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that there are typefaces out there that have added
    lowercase characters to Neuland's letters, and some of these typefaces may indeed
    be stylistically harmonious. But I don't know where to send you.\r\n\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Treacyfaces offers this family (Neue Neuland) with lowercase in several weights.
    Look at \r\n<a href=\"http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html\">Treacyfaces/Headliners</a>\r\nand
    scroll to Neue Neuland. It's not bad, though a bit of a chimera. "
