  I've made the switch to InDesign (CS2) and have been using the optical kerning for
  headlines, titles and larger type. There are tweaks to be made after applying it,
  depending on the situation but it seems like a much better starting point than Metrics
  for large type. Has the technology improved since the above posts in the new versions
  of InD? Is this bad practice? How do others use this feature? or do you use it at
  all? I feel like this optical spacing would be inappropriate for body copy? Are
  some typefaces setup with 'optical' AND 'metrics' or is this purely an InD technology?
  Discuss!"

    on smaller text. So, you would not get the *same* spacing/kerning at small sizes.
    Try out some text and see which setting you like better. For that matter try both
    Optical and Metrics kerning on several different typefaces.... You will find that
    ID loosens text at small sizes compared to the built-in kerning (Metrics), and
    tightens at large sizes. '

  body: "Mrs. Eaves looks best using it.\r\n\r\nOn a well done font, I tend to use
    built in metrics but track it tighter for large sizes. Fonts are typically tuned
    for a certain size range.  If I have a small amount of type for a heading at a
    large size (and if the standard metrics don't quite work) I track and kern it
    myself.  Sometimes I try the Adobe Optical and tweak it afterward. Mr. Cosgrove
    is right, just putz with it and see what works best.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Art Rafaeli's \"Book typography\" has an interesting discussion comparing
    and discussing the Optical, Metrics and Auto kerning functions of both InDesign
    and Quark.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584561572/sr=8-1/qid=1149529135/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-7115885-0516760?%5Fencoding=UTF8\">Book
    Typogaphy</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Here's a quote from Fig. 12 on page 29 in which a
    sample of text utilizing optical kerning is shown. The same text is sampled in
    the book's Figure 11 with metrics kerning applied:</strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>The optical
    kerning option tends to increase the spacing of characters as it moves from rightways
    or leftways and so the user's guide recommends that after the 'kerning' is applied
    some negative tracking should be applied generally to compensate for this. The
    literature does not say how much tracking might be needed but -7 seems  sufficient
    for this example. Note that the r and the comma in 'matter,' (in the tenth line)
    are now agreeably spaced."
