body: "Hi Folks,\r\nThis serif has baffled me. It reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/americana/\">Americana</a>,
  but the x-height is quite different. The 'T', 'k' and 'g' seem pretty distinctive,
  and do not match Americana. \r\n\r\nAnyone recognize this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n- Mike"

  body: "I haven't heard of that font. Do you have a link to show it?\r\n\r\nFor some
    reason I think I have seen this as a display font, from a small foundry, or maybe
    a freebie font, but I have not found it in Larabie's stuff or Nick Curtis's freebies.\r\n\r\nAny
    other ideas?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "'Broadsheet' is just Owens' take on 'Americana', so that doesn't get us much
    closer. \r\n\r\nI think 'Fligh High' was actually Ingrimayne's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/fly-high/\">'Fly
    High'</a>, right? That's not too far off, but as you said Paul-Kenji, the serifs
    aren't quite right.\r\n\r\nThe way the letters disconnect suggests adding negative
    stroke to the letters to erode them, but I still can't place the font. I thought
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carlton/\">'Carlton'</a> had some
    similarities, especially in x-height,  but I don't think that's it either. \r\n\r\nAny
    more ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just looked back at the sample, and I don't know what I was imagining when
    I said Carlton was like it. Never mind that one. Maybe Carlton flattened would
    be similar, but nah.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
