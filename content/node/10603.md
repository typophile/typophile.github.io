  body: I think it&#39;s at least customized, mostly because the &#39;whiskers&#39;
    &#40;or spikes, sounds more rugged&#41; all point outward on the outer letters,
    regardless of case. This seems too fortuitous just to be part of the font design.
    <BR> <BR>The lettering style has many Fraktur features, particularly the dagger-like
    &#39;p&#39;. but you&#39;ll notice there are two different &#39;h&#39; shapes.
    This argues even more for completely custom lettering, based on possibly a variety
    of Germanic Blackletter styles.

  body: Yes, but if you notice, the two &#39;h&#39; designs are not seperate, the
    lower h is simply a shortened stem while retaining the top elements. The curve
    on the right side of the stem where the top of the stroke touches the body of
    the letter may have been tweaked. I think the photoshop embossing or whatnot is
    affecting perception. The lower h looks like it has a smoother inside down-stroke,
    but I think that is caused by the play of shadow from the filter. Hmmm... Bastardized
    blackletter. Not a fan.

  body: You are right Eric, but my point is that the lettering is not &#39;out of
    the box&#39;. The artist may have just modified his own letters to create the
    two h&#39;s. And added the spikes to the outer letters. <BR> <BR>At the least,
    I think this is a highly customized font. At the most, it has been completely
    created by a lettering artist.
