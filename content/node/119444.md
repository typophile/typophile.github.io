body: "Greetings, fellow type enthusiasts!\r\nA couple of years ago, I came across
  [[http://typophile.com/node/31682|a thread on Typophile]] about the \"Spice Girls
  font\", a typeface I've been intrigued by ever since I first saw it in 1998. This
  font has been searched for by many, <em>many</em> people many, <em>many</em> times,
  but has never been found. The Typophile thread I mentioned did, however, yield a
  possible lead: the pre-digital typeface called Tempor. (Thanks, Mike F!) According
  to my (admittedly limited) research, a specimen of sorts was published in <em>The
  Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces</em> (on page 157 according to Solopedia
  -- though I might be wildly off there). Unfortunately I am unable to obtain a copy
  of this book at the moment, so I ask: if any of you could please be so kind to upload
  a scan of this specimen of Tempor, I would sincerely appreciate it. It's a mystery
  I would <em>love</em> to help solve.\r\nOh, also, if anyone has <em>any</em> information
  on it, such as the name/s of its designer/s, foundry, known digitizations, I will
  love you forever!\r\nThanks for reading. :)"

  body: Here's the specimen in question. It's definitely in the same vein. Dan X.
    Solo's books were nearly comprehensive, he just wasn't great about providing source
    information. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/tempor_3581.jpg]

  body: "Thank you <em>so</em> much, ralphsmouse! I sincerely appreciate it. Yes,
    I see now that it is similar, but not an exact match. Sigh.\r\nI know the typeface
    I'm looking for is not custom because I've seen it used a few times over the years
    on a wide range of things. For example, [[http://media.meltybuzz.fr/article-839395-ajust_930/logo-aides.jpg|the
    logo of the French charity AIDES]] and a video cassette titled [[http://pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2012/12/29/DSCN7505.JPG|<em>Secretos
    de la Trilogia de Regreso al Futuro</em>]], which I assume is a documentary about
    the <em>Back to the Future</em> films.\r\nThe latter item tells me that the typeface
    has been in use since at least 1990. Gosh, I wish I could figure this out!"

  body: "I'm thinking this typeface could be from a dormant/defunct early digital
    type foundry. From what I can tell, Spice Girls fans have been trying to figure
    out the origin of this particular typeface for ages. For that reason, I can't
    be sure if the typeface was ever widely known or distributed. It might have came
    on a type CD-ROM package (a very 90's way of distributing digital typefaces).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spice_6302.png]\r\nI
    lifted this from a Spice Girls autograph sheet. A lot of later samples are horizontally
    stretched out of this world."

  body: "My apologies by advance if my words sound lazy/boring/dull/killjoy because
    everything I'm going to say has already been said and argued. But since it's stumped
    all type ID communities across the world, maybe it is time to definitely close
    and accept the evidence... SPICE GIRLS will never return and even if we identify
    the font.\r\nTo me, from what I could see from this CD covers is they're at least
    2 different fonts (or 1 font and 1 lettering). /S from 'SPICE' woodmark has a
    horizontal transition not the one for text. \r\nThe text one looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/europa-grotesque-rr|Europa
    Grotesque]] (less is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/california-grotesk|California
    Grotesk]] mainly because of /a spur). That said it could be not so hazardous to
    accept the idea 'SPICE' would be a custom lettering, derived from Europa Grotesk
    (and very easy to recreate actually). "

  body: Ryuk, I feel what you say, but for me the |S|s on the CD are too small to
    determine which type of curve they have on the spine, and the ones on the MiniDisk
    (http://lonestarspice.com/albums/spicemd2.jpg) have the same angle as the one
    on the logo. And the new examples given by Rick (http://typophile.com/node/119444#comment-588084)
    also have the same kind of |S|.

    the cause... Let the SPICE GIRLS rest in peace and accept the ineluctable truth.
    There will be no come back for them! But I agree, I'm probably as bitter as you...
    No more Posh, Sporty, Ginger, Baby and Scary all together... I know but we're
    living in a cruel world... And it does not solve the mystery either... And what
    about Europa Grotesk with a custom /S to end up the discussion?

  body: "Haha! Thanks for the laugh, Ryuk. Yeah, I'll admit it (although I'm pretty
    sure it's painfully obvious): I'm a Spice Girls fan, have been since I was 13,
    and yeah, the Spice Girls are definitely <em>not</em> coming back. I'm happy with
    the fact that they're done, actually; their new material on their <em>Greatest
    Hits</em> release proved that they're no longer the success that they were back
    in the late '90s. (Just between us: the new songs were AWFUL. There, I've said
    it!)\r\nThank you again for your contributions, ralphsmouse. Appreciated. I, too,
    have wondered about it being some obscure early digital type, the product of a
    long-defunct foundry, or simply a face that was offered for a time and then taken
    off the market (it's downright painful when that happens!).\r\nThe closest I've
    come across is House Gothic -- particularly its Bold Alternate Caps -- by House
    Industries; the 'S' is remarkably similar -- the other letters ... eh, not quite.\r\nOh,
    and thank you too for your input, Riccardo. I love being around knowledgeable
    type peeps."

  body: "Just for the sake of completeness, and to corroborate what Rob (ralphsmouse)
    and Ryuk suggested, I will add that, according to MyFonts, the digital Europa
    Grotesque (2002?) is \"based on [ATF's] Europa Grotesque series circa 1960\".\r\nSo
    there could have been an early (more or less legit) digitalisation of it, and
    maybe the horizontal spine of |S| was in the original (or, au contraire, was introduced
    to get away with the knock-off).\r\nUnfortunately, I'm unable to locate a pre-digital
    specimen (or any mention of it, for that matter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders_%28list_of_types%29
    ).\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I never had willingly (or knowingly) listen anything
    by the Spice Girls."

  body: "The Europa Grotesque connection makes sense, guys. Thank you.\r\nTo me the
    \"Spice Girls font\" seems softer and (dare I say) rounder than Europa Grotesque
    -- at least the digitalization(s) I've seen. Even so, it doesn't rule out the
    possibility that it might be derived from Europa Grotesque.\r\nI'm now at the
    point where I'm considering contacting AIDES to inquire about who designed their
    logo. Does that make me seem crazy, obsessed and ever so slightly desperate?"

  body: "Looking back at the discussion, and by casual visual comparison of the Spice
    Girls sample posted by rob nolan, to the digital Europa Grotesque and California
    Grotesque displays at Myfonts, I see the width of the logo as being closer to
    California Grotesque than Europa Grotesque and, the weight as being somewhere
    between California Grotesque Bold and California Grotesque Black.\r\nBlend the
    two weights, edit the central portion of the _S_ diagonal to make it horizontal,
    drop the center line on _P_, open the space between the terminals on _C_ and you
    pretty well have what you want, what you really really want :) for the logo.\r\nA
    similar process might also work for the other letters shown in the sample.\r\nThe
    track listing on the Spice Girls CD http://lonestarspice.com/singles/suyluscd.JPG
    does not match the logo or the subheadings text in the posted sample, but does
    seem to match the smaller sized text. Note the diagonal on _S_ and sloped center
    strokes on _s_ and _a_ which are in the style of Europa.\r\nThe appropriate lowercase
    for a font matching the logo is pure speculation. IMO the Tempor model is more
    appropriate than Europa for letters such as _s_ and _a_.\r\nDon"
