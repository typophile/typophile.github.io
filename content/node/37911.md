  my major to graphic design from humanities. I have always been fascinated with type
  and letters (i used to be a graffiti artist) I am trying to built a portfolio so
  i can transfer to Art Center College of Design.  \r\n\r\nAnyways this is my first
  graphic design project. It's a poster, the subject Orphans.\r\n\r\nPlease critique
  away.. i wont get offended... your observations on my kerning will be definitively
  appreciated. i don't know if i messed up on the kerning since Gill Sans has a big
  range in between letters and i've done the opposite.\r\n\r\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/3701/picture1go3.png"

    just a statement, one can only look at the text kerning which is not kerned or
    spaced properly. \r\nAnd I think kerning like in 'WA' looks good only with Avant
    Garde.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you simply use Helvetica_?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xa_5174.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "I think choosing the mines sign confuses the message (or the message confuses
    the image), I would have thought that a line like \u2018Orphans are created long
    after the war is over\u2019 might work for this image or an alternative image
    might support your image better. As it stands you are right to be concerned about
    the kerning the point of kerning is not to create a mathematically equal space
    between characters rather to create an equal <em>visual</em> space. One method
    is to print out your type (in black on white so there is no interference from
    the  image) and view it upsidedown and squint at it \u2013\_this should reveal
    where there are darker or lighter areas which you can adjust indivdually until
    there are fewer obvious areas, however the point is not to upset the readability
    of the pairs of characters so one has to accept that some characters are not going
    to accept this treatment, the position of the comma is much too tight to N once
    you have amended this you should look at aligning the other characters on the
    right of the N (again visually rather than mathematically) so curved letters (S,D,R)
    will slightly extend beyond the line created by the more vertical characters.\r\n\r\nTim"

    size specification.\r\n\r\nAnd you should seriously consider adding a discreet
    drop shadow to the text."

  body: "i dont understand the significance of the white lines on the left, other
    than they mimic the shape of the grass, and with a message this strong every element
    in the piece should support it.\r\n\r\nthe typeface you're using (is it gill??)
    i think the typeface you choose should have a bit more heft to it, or at least
    a face in which the counters aren't as perfectly round maybe? that's more of a
    personal preference though, so test it out and run with your instinct\r\n\r\nNiki
