  CASE (U&lc) was a defining voice in world graphic design between 1970 and 1999.
  It was in some ways a lifestyle magazine for the design community \u2013 providing
  a fascinating intersection of popular culture and graphic design in the last quarter
  of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nU&lc was always large format at 11 x 14.75 until around
  1998 when they switched to a smaller 8.5 x 11 format.\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional
