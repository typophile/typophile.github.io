body: "I'm getting some strange glyph transformations when importing Word docs into
  IDCS3. It's changing all single quotes, double quotes, apostrophes, en dashes and
  em dashes to various other glyphs. \r\n\r\nThe text is set in TNR in the Word doc
  and I'm applying a paragraph style set with Californian. I end up having to do a
  Find/Replace with every import. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to solve this issue?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glyph_Issues_6630.jpg]"

  body: Thanks, Tiffany. I need to preserve styles and formatting because some text
    is in italic and some is bold. Plus, I just tried it with your settings and the
    same thing occurred. Very odd.

  body: 'Ah. No the settings I use preserve those styles. The styles it doesn''t preserve
    are the "style sheets" which might be used in Word. I did a tri-lingual dictionary
    with all kinds of styles all ready applied in Word, trust me I needed those styles
    in tact. What I didn''t want were any style sheets they might have applied. '

  body: To follow up on Miguel's suggestion, save as RTF and then read the file created
    in Notepad. It may be that the odd character thinks it is something else, or is
    set to be the same color as the background, or something else that will be apparent
    in the RTF.

  body: When you apply the paragraph style, is that in Word or ID? That is to say,
    can you apply Californian to the Word document before importing it into ID? Also,
    is the TNR used in Word TrueType, OTF, or PS?

  body: "Tiffany, I'll try your technique again. Maybe I did something wrong. With
    past versions of InDesign I was able to import Word docs and apply paragraph styles
    without losing bold or italic formatting and without having to deal with the glyph
    conversions. \r\n\r\nMiguel, saving as RTF worked, but I fear the idea of having
    to do this with all Word docs. I work at a magazine where stories are all saved
    as Word documents.\r\n\r\nGus, The TNR is TrueType. And I'm applying the styles
    in Word. I could apply Californian to the Word document I guess. But doing so
    would be time consuming given the volume of stories.\r\n\r\nEveryone, Thanks for
    your help."

  body: "Did anyone come up with a definitive solution for this?\r\n\r\nIn my case,
    I have a PC user creating Word files and the quotes and apostrophes get converted
    to weird punctuation glyphs. The short term work around I found is to open the
    Word file in Word on the Mac, add a space and press save. From there it imports
    properly because I assume Mac Word did the keyboard conversion. It seems like
    InDesign does not do a good job translating the PC keyboard into the Mac version.\r\n\r\nAny
    other suggestions would be appreciated!"

  body: Michael, this could be a bug in InDesign's importing filters. Please send
    me a sample Word document that shows the problem and I'll look into it. Thanks.
