    but sturdier, forms in the uppercase is really nice. I wonder though why you made
    certain decisions about some of the top serifs within the uppercase set. Compare
    H and I to V, W and U. Maybe I'm missing something. I know those straight letters
    at the end of the alphabet are something of a clique...\r\n\r\nI particularly

  body: "There is something still a bit frankenstein-like about the serif treatment.
    It seems arbitrary & theory-based rather than optical and observed. It does make
    me wonder about what I think though; which is a pleasant challenge. So far I am
    not sure. \r\n\r\nThe main thing I would encourage you to do is to think in terms
    of what the space between letters needs. The serif treatments need not be literally
    consistent to work. There are old & new fonts where this is so. Look at the a
    s and l (el) in \r\n<a href=http://www.ourtype.be/>Amalia </a>. There are 5 different
    approaches to the serifs. And yet to my eye each is working optically. You can
    tell this is true better from a print out than in the flash preview. \r\n\r\nI
    would also watch out for details that may sparkle and catch the eye a bit too
    much. It might be that the bases of those serifs do that. Or not. But I wonder.\r\n\r\nIn
    any event I will have a proper look soon."

    a better look at Calluna I'll be happy to send you a beta font file. Let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serifs_5236.gif]"

  body: "Hm, that smaller-size image actually gives a lot of insights. E.g. that the
    serifs on the minuscles are not as distracting as I thought they would be (they
    definitely were on the \"display\" sizes to me; on display sizes on the other
    hand such decoration, standing-out is desirable). They work really well!\r\nAs
    I said, it's the serifs I like about the font very much, and I see how they are
    the core of your experiment/development. On the other hand, while one could notice
    the discrepancy of the V,W,Us compared to the other capitals in the first version
    published, I'd give it a try the other way round: Would it be bold to suggest
    a trial of having the top serifs of the first vertical stem (or the only one)
    of any capital to be more symmetric (i.e. slightly more protruding to the right),
    transferring the minuscle-like characteristics only to the second vertical stem?
    (This came to my mind as two letters felt \"wrong\" to me: I and H; interestingly
    not so much L).\r\n\r\nI've got two-three more observations, but they are in the
    detail, and so I will shut up: it's a \"first peek not ready for crit yet\" after
    all :-)"
