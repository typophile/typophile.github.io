I'm thinking about a kind of abstractly outlined Broadway (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/broadway/), but I'm not sure that's what you're thinking about.

		<div class="commentbody">Nice concept. I'm think of a magazine page where a headline and a summary is set with this font so that the whole page is full of it. could be very interesting

I'm curious what a 'C' will look like. 
And what about giving variations of connections - for example to have a connection of the E to the right not only from the bottom but also from the top ...

And what about ornamental characters which can be used as a border or just to fill space?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@FixB : Yeah I think it could be great to have some variations to make different connections between letters, and I also tought a bit about making ornements. It could be funny and push the puzzle & labyrinth effects further.

BTW, It could be very interesting to have vertical ligatures with OpenType, even if I'm not aware of such thing.

@brockfrench : Thank you for your drawing! I understand your idea and I also thought about making it this way, but I soon left this idea because my goal is to make characters with connecting lines only.

I think adding inset forms this way would make them look heavier and focus too much the reader on.

Also, I admit I didn't really followed my rule for the punctuation, but I think it's better like this to let the whole thing breath a little.

Thanks for your help.

		<div class="commentbody">Fun! I'd say wire up the ampersand. While the V is fine, you may want to see if a V more in the style of your Y would be better.

Some users will probably want a plain intersection to use instead of a space. Since an alternate space glyph may be hard to implement, you could probably make it the plus sign.

The exclamation point will be a challenge... I imagine a straightforward solution would have inadequate impact. Maybe the glyph could be like three exclamation points.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for your help Cerulean, sorry for the late answer, but I thought I'd be better with an update of the font.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KKpreview_4164.jpg]

I agree with all your points, I was also thinking about a Y-like V and of course, I wired the ampersand. I'm still a bit lost with my exclamation point, for the moment I've just an — easy — cutted line, so it's less impacting than !!!!!!!!!!!

Also, I've got a minor bug when I export my font, on Illustrator when I write an apostrophe i've got a 'quoteright', but on TextEdit it's working well. Anybody has an idea about it ?

PS : The diacritics overlap negative is just a bug.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Bernard, it's definetely a good step further. I'm still waiting for the different connections. And I think your diacritics should be rethought. They are a little too small. And your £ seems a bit strange, probably it needs a second horizontal like €.

		<div class="commentbody">I would recommend connecting the C to the right from the top terminal, not the bottom terminal, to avoid possible confusion with a G. Also, the opening of C is very small, so the other terminal should probably stop where the € does.

There are some places where more of a sense of connectedness could be achieved by trimming off part of a glyph to make an intersection into a bend. The bottom of @, for instance, could stop at the middle, making it a continuation of the connector. Maybe the same for 9. The top of & could be open for a similar connection on top (and I think your first & had better proportions and angles, especially if you take this suggestion).

FlxB, ₤ is a symbol distinct from £; while both can be used for pounds sterling, one stroke is more common for pounds and two strokes is used for lira.</div>
