  sharing/selling? A budding type designer with a promising font, but not wanting
  to take the time to digitize it and take it to market?\r\n\r\nI'm getting started
  in digitizing files for DIY type patterns/projects/scrapbooking etc to be sold online.
  Files do NOT have to be rendered as vector or be an actual working font. \r\n\r\nI
  cannot pay much as I'm just getting started, but would love to get a conversation
  going with interested artists. Please include samples of your work and what you're
  expecting in terms of payment and licensing allowances.\r\n\r\nLove to hear from
  you!\r\n\r\nYou can email me at chgotom23@aol.com.\r\n\r\n`Tommaso\r\n\r\n"
