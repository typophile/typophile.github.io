body: "Hello everybody!\r\nI'm having a huge problem in Fontforge. I'm an absolute
  beginner at typography so please have mercy.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried to do was creating
  a type from hand-drawn letters. I used Illustrator to create a 'svg' file and transported
  the letters to Fontforge. I created every capital letters, every small letter, a
  period, question mark and some other extrema.\r\n\r\nI did the kerning manually
  without autokerning (I'm not used to this kind of thing so I won't be able to explain
  it in full detail).\r\nWhen I was finished I generated a truetype font. Sadly there
  is little to no kerning visible and I'm doubting the kerning applies at all. I need
  this font for a project so it's really urgent.\r\n\r\nI'm using WIndows XP nd apparently
  Fontforge version 1 if this is of any help.\r\n\r\nI'm literally begging on my knees
  here. I don't know what to do. I probably just forgot to do a little thing, but
  I'm not sure.\r\nIf you have ANY Idea how to help I'll be happy.\r\n"

    is may not support OpenType features.\r\n\r\nWhen you generate your font, in the
    Truetype Options make sure \" Old Style 'Kern' \" is checked. That may solve your
    problem.\r\n\r\nGeorge"

  body: "Thanks to both of you.\r\n\r\n@George: I already tried that, sadly it didn't
    work out.\r\n@Janek: Thanks for the link! I'm reading it right now.\r\n\r\nI lucked
    out, because a friend of mine let me use his version of FontLab and I was able
    to kern the font there. I can't believe how much easier it is in FontLab.\r\n\r\nI
    guess my problem was, that I kerned the font with only one subtable. I am, of
    course, not sure, and I'm very, very thankful that you took your time to help
    me! \r\nIf you still know why this didn't work out I would be happy to learn!
    I used the Windows Font Viewer to look at the kerning and added it in InDesign
    where it clearly showed no signs of kerning.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Konfetti_6586.gif]"

    you upload the feature file somewhere? It will tell something (or not).\r\n\"I
