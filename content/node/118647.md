  I imagine the wordmark to have a modern, Western-friendly appeal, but with a subtle
  Asian warmth and sharpness to it. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asian-01_4472.png]

  Symbol Std has caught my attention so far, but I\u2019m really not comfortable with
  the varying thickness of the stems and the loops. Also, the thicker weights look
  nice but when it comes down to the lighter weights, the typeface looks odd.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asian-03_4874.png]\r\n\r\nI
  have also found Penumbra to be appealing although I wish it had more subtle serifs
  and available lowercase letters for the wordmark I\u2019m designing.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  not sure if you guys have encountered something like this before, but if you can
  help suggest alternatives, I\u2019d be eternally grateful!"

    Han Sans may be a good candidate, like what my upstairs reply has written. Despite
    its wide coverage and weight options, however, I do not consider its CJK characters
    very well designed."

    body: "Thank you for your suggestion. The wordmark will not go with any Asian
      typeface since the city, sadly, is no longer rooted on an Asian writing system.
      We use the regular Roman/Latin script instead. \r\n\r\nHaving said this, what
      I\u2019m actually looking for is a modern, contemporary Latin script, serif
      or non-serif, that has subtle accents that gives it an Asian feel. Kind of like
      the typeface of \u201CThailand\u201D in this photo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thailand-infra-1-620x407_5753.jpg]\r\n\r\nReally
      sorry if I\u2019m too particular about this. Any suggestion is welcome!"

      body: "According to your description I do believe that it is either a trap or
        an impossible mission.\r\n\r\nFirst of all there is no \"Asian feel\" for
        Western typography \u2013 one can do his best to harmonize two writing systems,
        but cannot transfer the feeling of one system simply onto another. Or, at
        least, he can transfer a typeface's aura to another typeface. Trying to make
        it \"feel Asian\" is either stereotypical and caricatural \u2013 China for
        Tian'anmen and dragon, Japan for Mt. Fuji and Sun Flag, etc. \u2013 or impossible.\r\n\r\nSecond,
        there is a trap of using a style of Western typography from a certain period,
        i.e. the 1930s and the 1950s, to imitate the feeling of Western type in Asian
        countries at that time (these type would be similar to those that appear in
        old matchboxes exported to those Asian areas). But keep in mind that for many
        Asian countries, those days were the time of national defeat and colonialism.
        Trying to evoke the feeling of Western invasion and colonial rule certainly
        isn't something pleasant..."

  body: "An Asian city that is not currently rooted in an Asian writing system! I
    can understand why you cannot disclose your client, of course, but my knowledge
    of geography is telling me something isn't right here.\r\n\r\nThey haven't switched
    over to the Latin alphabet in Singapore, Macao, or Hong Kong - the only Asian
    cities I can think of that are not integral parts of nations that are very much
    using Asian writing systems (China, Japan, Korea).\r\n\r\nThe Philippines, Indonesia,
    and Malaysia... they use the Latin alphabet to various extents. But the traditional
    writing systems of their languages are either the Arabic script, or an Indic script,
    not something related to Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nOf course, an Indic script
    doesn't stop Tibet or Thailand from being Asian in character.\r\n\r\nMy worry
    is that if we give you the name of a typeface that tastefully evokes in a subtle
    manner Chinese characters, this may be a solecism, as they may not have anything
    to do with the cultural identity of the city in question.\r\n\r\nAnd if it's \"city
    branding\" to the extent of being used in the city's subway stations, your latitude
    for decorative flourishes is limited by more than the dictates of taste."

    could be Baybayin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin), but it probably would
    be at most nostalgic.\r\nThat said, there are other forms in which a typeface
    could give a \u201Cfeel\u201D of something without necessarily mimiking (or, as
    it seems the concern, parodying) a different writing system.\r\nAnd, in this case
    that becomes a necessity, since, for me, pan-asian goes from the Urals to the
    Bering Strait, covering a large number of different scripts!"

    body: "Yup, good job finding out I\u2019m from the Philippines! Baybayin, our
      ancient script, has long been discarded and it is no longer being used as a
      means of communication. We\u2019ve been using the Latin alphabet for centuries
      and because of the dearth of design professionals that specialize in typographic
      design in my country, there isn\u2019t really an effort to produce typefaces
      that are rooted in our culture (pre-colonial, colonial or contemporary).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
      pointless if I scour the web for contemporary typefaces that are authentically
      Filipino. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve resorted to looking for Latin alternatives.
      I may have made a mistake of using the term \u201Cpan-Asian\u201D since I realized
      our culture is just too diverse and complex. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate the
      options riccard0 provided. They are more or less examples of what I was talking
      about. "

  body: "Come to think of it, in the case of the Philippines, matters are more complicated.
    Babayin, the original script for the Tagalog language, is indeed Indic.\r\n\r\nAh:
    only about a third of the people of the Philippines have Tagalog as their first
    language. Pilipino is the \"standard register of Tagalog\" - the country's formal
    official language. Oh, and there is also a Filipino language, aimed at replacing
    Pilipino. However, most of the people there speak, if not Tagalog, another closely-related
    language.\r\n\r\nBut people of Chinese and Japanese descent play a significant
    role in the society as well. English is the Philippines' other official language,
    and Spanish also has an influence."
