  below , but of all the types I can find , I'm coming up empty on every one.\r\n\r\nThe
  letters look as though they're based off Compacta somehow. Has anyone familiar with
  stencils ever seen such a font?\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stencil_ad_5740.jpg]"

    digital font.\r\nIf you need a similar stencil, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/club21/portfolio/?&sample_text=GLO-SHIELD&sample_size=96\">Portfolio</a>.
    It is less square, and the \u2018G\u2019 doesn\u2019t have a beard, though.\r\nAlternatively,
    you could create your own stencil from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsnerflake/compacta_1_ot/?&sample_text=GLO-SHIELD&sample_size=96\">Compacta</a>.\r\nF"
