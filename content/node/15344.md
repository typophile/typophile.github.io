body: "Normally I would never consider using -- let alone drawing -- this type of
  'ultra-geometric' lettering. But for this application (a sign manufacturer) I think
  it is the most appropriate solution.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to hear you throughts on the
  weight distribution and such. I have taken the top arm of the S glyph and brought
  it in a bit, to counter balance the character so it doesn't look like it it falling
  forward. I wonder if this is appropriate, etc.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?\r\n\r\n[Edit:
  I attached another PDF which details what they mark will look like in normal application]\r\n\r\n[Edit:
  I have posted the finished results]\r\n"

  body: "The vertical stem of the G looks a bit heavy to me, the open counters on
    the S looks a bit shallow in their depth (especially in the reversed out versions)
    and I wonder if the top left of the 1 needs the angled shape.\r\nTim"

  body: "I attached a new PDF.\r\n\r\nI agree, the G needed to be thinned up a bit.
    But I dont think the vertical arm needs to be the same size as the horz arms on
    the S. I think it need to be a tad bigger optically. I opened up the counters
    on the S. Technically it looks better, but I think I might like the sophocating
    looks. This needs to be really tight and compact. The hacked off serif on the
    1 doesnt work. There is a nice flow that is maintained from the top of the one
    through the S and the T. I want to try to kep this flow.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?"

    ones.

  body: "This looks fairly solid. The S works. I like the version with the smaller
    counters. The one minor quibble I have is the G form. In this case, because of
    the decreased counters, the G might work better with a very small horizontal crossbar
    that better distinguishes it better as a G. \r\n\r\nAre the brackets part of the
    mark? I like, but I'm <a href=\"http://www.agency26.com/\">biased</a>."

  body: "I did try the cross bar with the G, but it really just kills the counter
    space even more. The brackets will be part of the mark. I realise this is nothing
    original, but for the task at hand, I think it really works. The idea is that
    they form the 4 corners of 'a sign'.\r\n\r\nDid you like the S with the more open
    counters, or the one which is a little tighter? I'm still found of the tightness."

  body: "You are right to keep the original 1, the mod I suggested looks too precious
    in practice. I prefer the look of the opened counters, I think that it will need
    them if the logo is being used at a small(ish) size, although you could keep them
    for large applications like vehicle livery. The slightly smaller G works well.\r\nTim"
