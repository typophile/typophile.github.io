  body: "Yes. With [[http://fontforge.sf.net|FontForge]], not FontLab, as stated.
    You need to have X11 installed. If it's not on your Mac already, you can install
    X11 from your MacOS X install disk. libSpiro is a separate library that needs
    to be installed in addition to FontForge to make Spiro drawing mode work.\r\n\r\nSee
    the [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/mac-install.html|FF Mac installation notes]]
    for details and also install [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&package_id=302003&release_id=645772|these
    dependencies]]"

  body: I want to use Spiro as well. But somehow with no success. I have fontforge
    working on X11 but can't seem to work with Spiro. I am attaching a screen shot
    of the active area in Spiro. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/spiro_screen_6605.jpg]
    These are the only active knots visible in a very narrow left top corner. My mac
    is an IntelMac OSX 10.5.6. Any suggestions what the cause of it is? Many thanks!

  body: Raph may have to chime in on this. I recall ppedit has the save feature somewhat
    oddly enabled. Is FontForge not working for you either?

  body: Fontforge is working perfectly, on my computer, I've already started some
    design projects on it. But I can't seem to work with the Spiro. Although I remember
    using it once with my powerpc laptop on an earlier OSX. I discovered the active
    area only today actually, a tiny rectangular area which pen can work. Seems very
    odd...

    separate ppedit application?\r\n\r\nI think we're talking about two different
    things here and it's confusing.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet tried FontForge on an Intel
    Mac, so I can't really speak on that issue."

  body: "ppedit's functions are very limited. It's a demonstration of the Euler/Cornu
    spiral drawing concept, not much more. It can be used for font production in a
    roundabout way. Raph Levien has done this himself, but he wrote the thing and
    knows stuff about its inner workings I can't tell you. \r\n\r\nIf you're trying
    to use it for font drawing, it's much easier to use Spiro mode in FontForge instead.
    ppedit's rendering is prettier, though."

  body: "It is possible to use ppedit (it's how I did Inconsolata), but it's not for
    the faint of heart. You use ctrl-S to save (to a file called \"plate\"), and ctrl-P
    to convert to PostScript outlines (to a file called \"/tmp/foo.ps\"). I used additional
    commandline tools to import the PostScript outlines into FontForge, as well as
    to optimize them to minimal Beziers. Some of those utilities also ship in the
    spiro distribution.\r\n\r\nThese days, I'm more inclined to use FontForge's spiro
    drawing mode. I am frustrated by the UI clunkiness, and by the lack of rendering
    quality, but having the curves right there in the font instead of having to do
    conversions is a pretty major win.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I want to get a good,
    usable, and pretty editing environment out there, but I don't have much time for
    it right now, juggling too many other things as it is. I'm most inclined to do
    it in in-browser Javascript, as browsers have finally gotten good enough to pull
    that off, and it's truly cross-platform. I'm not inclined to do much further development
    on ppedit, unfortunately - it would take a <em>lot</em> of work to make it into
    a real tool.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you guys are enjoying experimenting with Spiro."
