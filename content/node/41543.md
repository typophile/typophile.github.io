  copy of Poliphilus and Blado with the old-style figures as default?\r\nThe bog-standard
  TT versions on the obvious sites seem to have lining numerals, and the text numerals
  only on the expert set.\r\nDo I have any choice?\r\nOr should I stop being a wuss
  and buy both the regular AND the expert anyway?"

    target=\"_blank\">Pro version</a> at MT's site (there are also individual weights).
    If I understand the icons right, then it includes oldstyle numerals.\r\n"

    point in getting Van Dijck as well \u2013 though I've only just clicked the \"related
    products\" link to see the individual Pro versions of Poliphilus & Blado, which
    are of course a possibility.\r\n\r\nBut I think my main question was that although
    this one does seem to have all the OT features, I was wondering if there were
    any versions out there that had old-style numbers as the <em>default</em> (so
    that I could use it in non-<wbr>OpenType-<wbr>savvy applications such as (whisper
    it quietly) Word)... ;-D\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nEver

    so thought it is an \"Is there an OT version at all?\" question. (So sorry about
    this Word thing.)&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\nAFAIK, <cite>most</cite> OT fonts have
    (tabular) lining numerals as default."

  body: "I believe that all Linotype, Monotype, and Adobe (?) OT faces have lining
    figures on as default. You have to active oldstyle figures as an OpenType feature.
    However, I have been told that you can change your preferences in InDesign so
    that the osf feature will be on by default. Failing that, you could control this
    with a style sheet IIRC.\r\n"

  body: "Cheers guys; so it looks like my only option is to (a) get any of the OT
    versions, and then (b) only use it in OT-savvy applications (don't have InDesign,
    but could fire up Quark 7)... \r\n\r\nAt least I know where I stand. \r\n\r\nAlthough:
    would the licence allow me to open the thing up in TypeTool and swap the numbers
    around so that OT-ignorant apps could access the text numerals? (Thin ice, I'm
    aware...)\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nEver since

    Quark sets terrible type. I couldn't live without Adobe Paragraph Composer."
