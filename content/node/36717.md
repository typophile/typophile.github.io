body: 'I like to open the program we use at work, Multi-Ad Creator, and type my specimens
  for print in that program (for two reasons: I like using it, and my fonts are for
  work, so they need to work with this program). However, with one font I have been
  creating, I have a problem with the program crashing while trying to create an EPS.
  At first I thought it was a problem with the program, but it appears to be a problem
  with a few of the number characters in my font. As long as I don''t type any of
  the certain numbers that cause the problem, the EPS comes out fine and Distiller
  makes a PDF with no issues. I have examined and re-examined the numbers, I cannot
  find anything different in these shapes than every other glyph in the font. Does
  anyone have any ideas as to what might be causing these crashes?'

    interesting to open the font in a font editor and see if there is anything unusual
    about those particular glyph outlines - overlapping paths or some such.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "It's not a commercial font, just something I've been working on. The 2, 3
    and 4 all crash Multi-Ad when I make an EPS, although they seem to work in Illustrator
    CS2 just fine. Creator is usually a pretty reliable program, hence why we use
    it in our workflow. I see nothing wrong with any of these glyphs in fontlab, for
    instance, the 4 below.\r\n\r\nI am very much an amateur at type design; I will
    most likely redraw all these characters anyway, but I'd like to figure out what's
    wrong with these to avoid it in the future.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lnght4_5741.jpg]"

    in the wrong direction. (Quick fix in FLS5: Contour menu > Paths > Set PS Direction.)
    Also check the outlines with the FontAudit tool if you haven''t already.'

    not fix the issue with the Creator crash.

  body: Will a lack of node placement at extremes cause crashes as described? I've
    since learned to do so, just haven't cleaned this one up b/c I have started over
    on it.

  body: oddly enough, I opened this font on my Mac at work and made the .otf there
    (instead of on my home PC) and it works just fine, with no modifications versus
    the .otf I generated at home.
