  solutions, just announced that Garmin International Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd.
  (Nasdaq: GRMN) and the global leader in satellite navigation, has licensed the iType\xAE
  font engine from Monotype Imaging to display scalable, high-quality text on a range
  of Garmin\xAE n\xFCvi\xAE automotive navigation devices.\r\n\r\nJohn Seguin, executive
  vice president of Monotype Imaging, noted that \"As a company focused on creating
  navigation and communication devices that enrich customers\u2019 lives, Garmin is
  able to realize key benefits that are passed on to consumers through our font scaling
  technology. We\u2019ve tailored our iType font engine to enable memory-constrained,
  consumer electronics devices to display clear, aesthetically pleasing text that
  can be scaled to any size. Other key iType capabilities include fast rendering speed,
  small code size, and the ability to apply special effects, such as displaying text
  outlined in different colors. This enables text to stand out from detailed or colorful
  backgrounds, such as maps. As devices become more interactive throughout the world,
  we believe that fonts will take on an even more important role.\u201D\r\n\r\nSteve
  Martin, vice president of engineering at Monotype Imaging, also stated that \"The
  iType font engine is simply a good fit. Garmin is able to count on iType technology
  to render sharp, legible text across a wide range of screen sizes. Garmin is also
  able to reduce the font memory footprint of their devices, which means that more
  memory can become available for speeding the delivery of other on-screen features
  and services.\u201D \r\n\r\nAbout the iType font engine\r\n\r\nMonotype Imaging\u2019s
  iType scalable font engine, based on the OpenType\xAE and TrueType\xAE font formats,
  allows OEMs and developers to build products that clearly display characters regardless
  of screen resolution or display size. In addition to fonts optimized for consumer
  electronics devices and innovations such as Monotype Imaging\u2019s patent-pending
  SmartHint\u2122 technology, which enables the clear display of East Asian text,
  the iType font engine supports Monotype Imaging\u2019s stroke-based fonts, multilingual
  TrueType fonts, custom typefaces, bitmaps, embedded bitmaps, font subsets and linked
  fonts.\r\n\r\nThe iType font engine removes dependency on bitmap fonts, which are
  fixed in size. While bitmap fonts require individual sets for each type size and
  style supported by the device, the iType font engine requires just one scalable
  font for each style to cover all sizes. By removing the burden of storing multiple
  bitmaps, device manufacturers and developers are able to reduce memory usage on
  fonts. \r\n\r\nFor a firsthand look at the capabilities of the iType scalable font
  engine, try Monotype Imaging's Font Technology Demo please visit http://demo.monotypeimaging.com/itypewtle.aspx.
