body: "So I've run into an issue with backup fonts for a client specific font being
  used on a templated web site.\r\n\r\nThe client font runs about 10% smaller than
  every other font, so that means if I specify the font-size at say 32px, and the
  user can't use the custom font for whatever reason, the displayed backup (in this
  case Impact) ends up a fair bit larger and can break unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nAs far
  as I can tell the only solution is to take the custom font and scale it up to create
  a more custom version. Whats the best way to do this? Is there a quick piece of
  software capable of this or do I have to go into a font editing software and scale
  every single glyph (ughh!)?"

  body: Assuming your fallback fonts are standard, you can use the Font Squirrel Generator
    (in Expert mode) to auto-resize the glyphs to match your target fallback font.

  body: "If you do opt to adjust the scaling of your custom font, the easiest way
    to do this is simply to change the font UPM value. To increase the size of the
    font +10%, you would reduce the UPM value by 10%. So, for instance, if your font
    has a UPM value of 1000, you would reduce this to 900. This is the best way to
    scale an already mastered font, because it means that you don't have issues with
    rounding of outline geometry, loss of hints, having to recalculate vertical metrics,
    etc.\r\n\r\nThe one caveat with this approach is that if your font is PS format
    some PDF creation software will incorrectly scale a font whose UPM does not equal
    1000."

  body: "Ralf - font-size-adjust only seems to work with Firefox (darn, that would
    have worked too!)\r\n\r\nfontquirrel - The fallback is Impact which is generally
    an accepted standard. Font Squirrel seems to mess up the custom font though for
    whatever reason when converting. I set it to match x-height of the various options,
    and it just returns nothing for that letter. It works if I don't match x-height\r\n\r\nJohn
    - What software would I use to change the UPM? Anything free by chance?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ideally, you want to change the UPM while not touching anything else in the
    font, so I would recommend using <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/\">TTX</a>
    for this, if you want a free tool. I use DTL OTMaster for this kind of work, but
    it isn't free.\r\n\r\nUsing TTX, you would decompile the font's head table using
    this syntax from the command line:\r\n\r\n<code>ttx -t head [inputfontfilename]</code>\r\n\r\nThen
    open the resulting .ttx xml file in a text editor, change the UPM value and save
    the xml file. Then merge the .ttx xml into the font:\r\n\r\n<code>ttx -m [inputfontfilename]
    [inputttxfilename]</code>"

  body: Silly question, but if the client's font is Impact, wouldn't it be a lot easier
    just to use Impact as a web font from the Fonts.com web fonts service? (www.webfonts.fonts.com)  That
    way it would be automatically downloaded to all the major web browsers.
