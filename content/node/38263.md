body: "When Adobe announced the acquisition of Buzzword, the Flash based word processor,
  I couldn't wait to check it out especially with a quote like this... \r\n\r\n\"Because
  it was built with Adobe Flex\u2122 software and runs in the Adobe Flash\u2122 Player,
  Buzzword enables greater document quality, <EM>outstanding typography</EM>, page
  layout controls, and robust support for integrated graphics, regardless of the browser
  or device.\" \r\n\r\nIt's pretty cool, but I'm going to have to fire up the Phinnsignal
  on the outstanding typography claim ;-)\r\n\r\nHere's what they present when you
  launch it up...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dashing_4466.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fakequotes_6145.JPG]\r\n\r\nwhole

  the font list\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BuzzOnTheStreet_6278.JPG]\r\n\r\nI
  know it\u2019s a beta \u2013 and Tom will I\u2019m sure be helping them out, but
  let\u2019s save the \u201Coutstanding\u201D til they beat WP 5.1 ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers,

    CS3 installed. Or whatever I have before that happens. Trying to use Photoshop
    on the internet sounds hideous, to say the least, unless Adobe installs an incredibly
    fast cable connection to my modem.

    Guy Kawasaki it saved Apple's Bacon when they brought out the Mac. Both of them
    were deeply flawed but together they became important. My point is just that it
    is smart to build it & bang on it til it works if you have deep enough pockets
    to get it right eventually. And Adobe, Google & MS all theoretically do. And think
    of all the cruft that Adobe must be side stepping!"

  body: "The relevant question that with a word processor be it an app or an online
    app is 'does it do what I need it to do?'. It's the same question. It's a human
    question. It will vary with the person. \r\n\r\nSo the tech is not important except
    in as much as it impacts the actual usefulness of the app to real people.\r\n\r\nConsider,
    web based email is both far better & far worse than app based email. I think we
    can all describe the virtues & deficits already because of our experience with
    each. I am really glad we have both. I can imagine being glad to have both for
    Word processing too - and deciding to use them differently just like I do email
    apps."

    whenever you moved to a new page. This made horrendously huge files unless you
    renamed the file every now and then, which eliminated all the intermediate saves.
    \r\n\r\nI guess this was because the program was so prone to crashing that this
    provided better backup. And I guess the crashes were understandable when the OS,
    the program, and your data files were all fighting to live on 512K of RAM and
    400K on the single disk drive that was then standard."

    we were onto Indesign 2 and we still had copies of Pagemaker being used for a
    client. Talk about a pain the rear.
