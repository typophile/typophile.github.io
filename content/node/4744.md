  target="_blank">http://www.skycaptain.com/</a>  <BR>which happens to be my most
  anticipated movie of the year,  <BR>was updated with all kinds of cool stuff, and
  in particular most <BR>of the site is now using the font Futurex Phat, that I designed
  <BR>and put into the public domain several years ago as part of the  <BR>Futurex
  project! <BR>see: <a href="http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=180"

  <BR>Yeah, I&#39;m sure some of you actually get paid to do fonts for  <BR>movies,
  but this is my little time to shine! :D <BR> <BR>Take care!'

  body: Yeah really, way to go. I was stoked to see my free stomper font on the packaging
    for the movie Exit Wounds. The movie was a so-so action flick, but any exposure
    is good exposure.

    to a commercial product that you received absolutely no financial compensation
    for!
