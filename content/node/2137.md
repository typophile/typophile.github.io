  body: I can&#39;t shake the feeling this is a recent <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/"
    target="_blank"> FontFont</a>. <BR>But I can&#39;t find it. Maybe I&#39;m just
    confusing it with <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF01134601P2"

  body: Yves I agree its a font. Fontdude, post you answer and wait for the server
    error and then hit command/control [ and then scroll up to topics and then come
    back down to the place where you posted, like magic your post is there and best
    of all its only once.
