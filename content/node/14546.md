  measure between thick and thin strokes of a letterform. \r\n\r\nOriginally produced
  by the angle of the brush or pen nib, contrast was retained through the advent of
  mechanical type design and greatly exaggerated in the work of Didot and Bodoni.
  It was later almost completely eradicated in sans serif designs of the early twentieth
  century."
