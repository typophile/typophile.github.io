  first time I've attended the conference and I'm curious how many here will also
  be attending. If anyone has some interesting bits of info, I'd appreciate them.\r\n\r\nThe
  web site for TypeCon is not really clear. For example. I have attended the International
  Calligraphy Conferences in the past, and the cost of the conference, while much
  higher than TypeCon, includes housing and meals. \r\n\r\nSInce I had to register
  with the Hotel separately from the conference, I assume meals are not included in
  the event either. I'm not planning to attend any classes (which have extra fees),
  so I wonder what my fee IS covering. Please understand, I'm not complaining, just
  curious as to what to expect.\r\n\r\nRob"

    too many awesome choices in N'awlins. :-)  So the fee is \"only\" covering admission
    to great content. And the opportunity to mingle with people who are both knowledgeable
    and nice. I guess some conferences include the hotel so you don't stay anywhere
    else (since that makes the hotel charge the organization less for using the conference
    rooms). I'm all for immersion* but it's not for everybody - and most towns have
    enough to see that some people will drift in and out, making a vacation out if
    it.\r\n\r\n* The first TypeCon comes to mind. Once in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nI'll
    be there. Along with anybody with cojones:\r\nhttp://www.typecon.com/archives/400\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I suppose the difference between the International Calligraphy and Lettering
    Arts Conference and TypeCon may be that the ICLAC is usually held at a college
    campus and the accommodations are less frills. Classes (workshops) are held in
    actual classrooms and meals are provided in the campus cafeterias.\r\n\r\nAs I
    said, since I've never been to a TypeCon, I am wondering what to expect. And I'm
    really looking forward to it. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I will see you there, hrant....\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else going?"

    not quite accurate. Unless things are significantly different from previous years,
    the various evening receptions will involve at least nibbles, and the Saturday
    night party is catered (usually with massive amounts of food). Lunches are not
    provided, and most evenings you'll want a meal in addition to whatever nibbles
    are provided at events."

  body: "Hi Rob. I hope your first TypeCon will be an enjoyable one. \r\n\r\nThis
    year will be slightly different from past years as our location is much more convenient
    to food options as we are right on Bourbon Street. There will still be coffee
    and pastries and such at breaks and other nibbles at different events, but the
    real food is out there in wild. Overall, it will be a much better culinary experience.\r\n\r\nThere
    will also be a printed restaurant guide at registration provided by the local
    committee. These locations will be posted on TypeCon.com soon as well.\r\n\r\nSee
    you all soon!"
