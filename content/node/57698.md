body: "Well, this is probably a easy one:\r\n\r\nWhen working in FreeFont mode, how
  can I assign automatically a lower-case acute mark to a lower-case glyph and a upper-case
  mark to a upper-case glyph?\r\n\r\nFontlab insists on giving lower-case marks to
  all characters.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."

  body: "If you name your uppercase accents with a .case suffix FontLab will use most
    of them. You can customize all of this by editing the alias.dat file. You can
    go as far as using small cap accents named with a .smcp suffix and most of them
    will work as well. Watch out for those caron.case and caron.smcp uses. You really
    have to edit alias.dat for those to work.\r\n\r\n"

  created: '2009-05-22 20:40:08'
- author:
    name: '.00'
  body: The tilde before the component is an instruction not to reposition the component.
    One assumes that the .case or .small accents are designed at the appropriate height
    to correctly position over the glyphs. If you left the tilde out FontLab would
    raise the position of the accent assuming it was originally positioned for the
    lowercase.

  body: "I'm trying to make the L-caron but can't get it to work. First off, since
    the caron in L-caron looks like a comma, I created a glyph called 'caroncomma'.
    I doubt this is how it's supposed to be done, so what's the correct way?\r\n\r\nI
    used caroncomma to generate l-caron and it works as I would expect. For L-caron
    I created a second caroncomma and tried the names caroncomma.cap, caroncomma.case
    and caroncommacap but in all cases the caron is placed too high in L-caron. So
    what do I change in alias.dat to fix this? Also, won't I run into problems when
    opening the font on a computer which has the unmodified alias.dat?"
