body: "On Pages, some kerning pairs of my font are missing. Surprising for me is that
  this happens for just some of the glyphs within a kerning class created in FontLab.
  The inconsistencies are consistent through my whole type family:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>/W/
  and /V/ both belong to the same kerning class (right and left), but the behavior
  is not as expected.</li>\r\n<li>/Va/ works but the kerning pair /Wa/ is missing.</li>\r\n<li>For
  both /Vo/ and /Wo/ the kerning is not recognized.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3968.png]\r\n\r\nOnly
  the characters belonging to the kerning classes shown have this problem in Pages.\r\n\r\nIn
  InDesign (using the font's kerning, not optically calculated), Font Book and TextEdit
  everything works fine, but in Photoshop the behavior is even worse, with more missing
  kerning pairs, which were present in Pages, like /Va/ or /TA/.\r\n\r\nAny hints?"

  body: "I removed the V class, which contained /V/ and /W/, and kerned them independently
    to see what was really going on. In fact, I noticed that ALL kerning pairs are
    missing, except those of the <em>key glyphs</em> from each kerning class. Now
    I have a problem. I thought I could \"brute-force\" solve this by kerning each
    problematic pair individually, but now this isn't an option anymore.\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas? Does this has to do with the OpenType export preferences? What am I missing?\r\n\r\nI'm
    going insane: trying it all, comparing with other fonts... nothing seems to enlighten
    anything."

  body: Hi Alexis, could you tell me which part of the link you provided actually
    did help you ? I have the same problem as you seem to have on a new font I'm working
    on right now, and I'm not sure I get the solution.

    turning off the \"Export old-style non-OpenType kern table\" option in FontLab
    > Preferences > Generating OpenType & TrueType > Kerning. It did the trick for
    me ;-)"

  body: Thank you Alexis for getting back to me so fast. As strange as it seems, this
    doesn't work for me. To be more accurate, kerning IS rendered as it should be
    in Photoshop or other software, but this time I'm having an issue with PHP and
    creating images with GD library, but I guess it could be something different.
    Thank you again for your answer ;)

  body: "Sometimes, you have to go through and delete the over rides of class kerns.
    \ If you keep the selection \"class kerning with exceptions\" on, it is quite
    easy to just tab to the next pair and add a zero to it by accident.  Overrides
    are marked in red, so you can run down the kern table and see if that is your
    problem.\r\n\r\nWhen you combine 2 classes, you have to remember to delete the
    kerning in the old key glyph that is now just a class member."
