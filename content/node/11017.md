  body: Thank you that is about as close as I have come. I don&#39;t think I will
    find a perfect match either.  We will try it and see what the customer thinks.  Thanks
    again have a great day

  body: I tried College,, Princeton Yearbook and Machine ended up modifying Princeton
    as it was the closest but if you do &#34;stumble&#34; across anthing with the
    same type of feel I would greatly appreciate it as we print first aid kits for
    stores and most of them are sports store who just send their business card and
    we have to recreate off of that.  Most of these guys have lettering with the &#34;sports
    team&#34; feel to it.  Thanks for all you help - Shawn

  body: 'Yeah, I found that one too, but it&#39;s not a match.  <BR>Check the &#39;S&#39;:
    it&#39;s got no serifs, and the tail of  <BR>the &#39;R&#39; is oblique. I couldn&#39;t
    find it online  <BR>anyway.'
