  is. I've seen it somewhere but I've trwaled through fontshop's script pages and
  can't seem to find it.\r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\n\r\nJono"

    material although I'm not sure what the original is. (I believe it is a hand lettered
    poster rather than type.)\r\n\r\nYour sample here appears to be slanted [[http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=unicorn_nf&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=semillero&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha|Unicorn]]
    which has this s which is a little different from the Einhorn and Salut one."
