  should visit. I am going to London this Monday and can&#39;t find it. Can anyone
  remind me at least some of them? <BR>Thanks in advance <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: One of my favourites is in Brewer Street, off Wardour Street in Soho &#40;green
    paintwork, adult section downstairs&#41;. Also I&#39;ve been recommended to Collinge
    &amp; Clark, 13 Leigh Street, WC1, but I haven&#39;t been there yet. <BR>Tim

  body: Collinge &amp; Clark is splendid if you are interested in private press books
    and more scholarly works on typography. If you are looking for graphic design
    books, then the design bookshop on Charing Cross Road &#40;east side, block-and-a-half
    south of Cambridge Circus&#41; is a better bet.

    <BR> <BR>Waterstones in picadilly circus has a small but useful typography section.

    looking for a certain issue of graphis from 1944 or a victorian lettering catalouge.
    The NAL is better than any bookshop. <BR>online catalogue: <BR><a href="http://ipac.nal.vam.ac.uk"

  body: Another favourite stop, for books on printing history, palaeography, calligraphy,
    etc. is the British Library bookshop. This is a short walk north of Collinge &amp;
    Clark.

  body: You should also pop into Zwemmers on Charing Cross Road &#40;is this what
    you meant, John?&#41;, and Foyles, a larger more general purpose but independent
    bookshop a bit further up the same road. <BR> <BR>Tim, if its the same one, the
    shop you mention is called Soho Books, and was the very first place I saw my own
    book on display <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Yes, I meant the Zwemmer&#39;s design shop, if that is indeed what it still
    is. Ownership seems to have changed at least twice in the past few years, and
    I couldn&#39;t remember if it was Zwemmers now or nor.

  body: Thanks David, I tend to navigate and give directions by pubs or colours, which
    is not to everyone&#39;s liking but I know where I am, some of the time. Was your
    book upstairs or downstairs:?
