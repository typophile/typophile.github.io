body: "This is how it works:\r\n<ul><li>A complete glyph is published in the Type
  ID Pop Quiz.</li>\r\n<li>Try to identify the typeface. To win, you need to name
  both the typeface and the weight.</li>\r\n<li>Show off your knowledge by casually
  mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first)
  published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The
  winner produces a new challenge -- a complete glyph, black on white background,
  presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The
  person who posts a challenge can't win the next game.</ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes,
  I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this
  is a little too difficult, maybe try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27995\">Entry
  Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a> first. Too easy? Go to the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27994\">Expert
  Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a>.\r\n\r\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>With
  respectful thanks to the originator of this utterly useless but highly entertaining
  waste of time, the often imitated but never duplicated Cheshire Dave.</em>"
