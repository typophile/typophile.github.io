body: "I was going to browse the wiki looking for foundries that might be interested
  in distributing some of my work. <strong>since the wiki is <em>down</em> *suggestion:
  get the wiki back, please?*</strong> I figured I'd ask a relevant question of the
  community.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>What is the minimum degree of completeness for a single
  font required by most foundries? What is the preferred level of completeness? (aside:
  hrant, I know nothing is ever finished in type design :-) )</li>\r\n<li>Are any
  foundries known to be kind to beginners? By this I mean, if they reject a submission
  to the offer criticism?</li>\r\n<li>How hard is it, really?</li>\r\n<li>What advice
  would you give to someone who wants to see their design reach a wide audience and
  maybe make a few dollars in the process?</li>\r\n<li>Whatever I haven't thought
  to ask explicitly but which would nonetheless be relevant to the overall question
  of \"how do I transition from an interest in type design to being a type designer?\"</li>\r\n</ol>"

  body: "in (partial) answer to your questions:\r\n\r\n1) most foundries want font
    submissions to be pretty much the final version. if an extensive amount of work
    is still in order, some foundries may finish the font for you, but with a cut
    in the royalties you would receive.\r\n2) my only real expereince is with [[IHOF]].
    I'm selling my first face, Kilkenny, through them. I think if a foundry thinks
    a design has potential, but needs a bit of tweaking, they'll give you suggestions
    on things you could change. i believe (i could be wrong) that you could set up
    your own foundry with myfonts.com. check this info: http://www.myfonts.com/info/prospectus/\r\n3)
    i had an in with IHOF since i work for P22, but had they not wanted to market
    this design, i would have tried letterheadfonts.com, as i feel my Victorian face
    was a good fit with much of their stuff and I think they would have gone for it.
    I think the trick is just to find a good fit for your work.\r\n4) hmmm... i'm
    still waiting to see how i do on this one. my first face is an experiment of sorts...
    i think the best way to make $$$ is to make a name for yourself and have your
    own website where users can order/download your fonts. i think fontdiner.com is
    an excellent model of this. this method involves more hassle: you have to do your
    own marketing and get your name out there. you also have to set up your website,
    &c... but the upside is you get to keep all the profits.\r\n5) i'll leave more
    qualified persons to answer this one.\r\n\r\nalso: don't forget about the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/7\">Release</a>
    section of the forums. there are several threads that answer similar questions,
    including this one:\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/8695\">Pros & Cons
    of Selling Through a Foundry</a>\r\n"
