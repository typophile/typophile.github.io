body: "I am completing a font which I have traced in Fontlab. I am currently trying
  to clean up the font, removing overlapping points etc, and I have noticed there
  are lots of grey arrows on some glyphs. (See image)\r\n\r\nCan somebody tell me
  what this means and what I should do about it. \r\n\r\nAlso is there a way of removing
  single points or incomplete paths automatically?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "They show the direction of the curve, clockwise or counter clockwise.\r\n\r\nIn
    FontLab you can optimize the curves automatically, to get rid of some stuff. But
    be careful if you have delicate shapes \u2013 they can be distorted or become
    something you didnt expect. \r\n\r\nUnder the meny \"Contour\" you have different
    choices that has to do with the curves and to clean them up, correct etc.\r\n\r\nTry
    them a little and you'll see what they do."

  body: PS. You dont have to do much about them if you fonts looks OK. But if you
    have black where there should be white, you should change the direction.

  body: "Ok thanks for your reply, I understand what you mean.\r\n\r\nIs there any
    specific feature that allows you to select single points or non-closed points.
    Its difficult to see this with the eye as some glyphs have up to a thousand points.\r\n"

  body: "Do you mean single points that are not part of the vector? In that case,
    you can select the glyph parts with the magic wand and then cut them out (. Then
    delete all points that are left in the glyph box (as they are not part of the
    glyph). Then just paste the glyph back.\r\n\r\nOpen countours you can close with
    the command \"close open countours\" I guess. I always do this manually, but I
    have never worked with a traced letter, maybe there is a lot of extra points then?\r\n\r\n"

    the font now.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help Goran!"
