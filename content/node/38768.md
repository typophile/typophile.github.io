  spent next to the pool working on my thesis letterforms, but are there some cool
  art/design/type things I should take a look at while I\u2019m there?"

    public transport that much and just take some strolls on the city (away from the
    hotel zones and more into the \"real\" city) armed with a camera and a sketchbook.
    We in M\xE9xico don't really have that much of cultural centres devoted to typography,
    but the lettering is just out there, in the wild. I am sure you will find something
    if you keep your eyes wide open."
