body: "Hi,\r\nmy first post here:) I'm learning graphic design, and unfortunately
  there is no typeface design class, but type is my hobby, but anyhow - judge me hard!\r\n\r\nSo,
  for now there's only lowercase characters, and I need some serious feedback, as
  I want to be sure about lowercase before going to uppercase.\r\nMy idea was that
  primary purpose for this type would be headlines and large sizes. But in the same
  time it would look good at small sizes.\r\nPlease comment on which details should
  I leave and which should go away, and any other comments would help.\r\nI will release
  it under CC, so all the comments will return in finished and good(hopefully) type
  for everyone to use.\r\n\r\n[[http://murelis.com/darbiftp/putnja/putnja-critics01.pdf|Putnja

  body: "I added \"putnja-critics02.pdf\" to first post!\r\n\r\n->\r\n\r\nSo, its
    sad, that no-one responded. \r\nAnyway, I finished uppercase - still struggling
    with details; I'm not sure which features to keep, and which to delete. Any suggestions?\r\n\"S\"
    is still huge pain, as I went over 8 versions of it, and now it looks decent,
    but still...\r\n\r\nAny advice would be great and highly appreciated!"

    minor features, dropped all kerning, and decided to polish spacing alone, before
    adding kerning. As I still plan to change minor details."

  body: "Can you tell us a bit more about your intended use? I'm not sure I can feel
    a particular mood conveyed here. The wobbles and unevenness seem to have a purpose
    but I'm not sure I understand it.\r\nThe spacing seems way too tight. \r\nI think
    the letters need to harmonise better. Compare the bowls on ceg and o...the thickness
    and contours are quite different. I realise you're trying to have some liveliness
    in there so the curves shouldn't be identical but the stress is moving around
    a bit too much. See what I mean by looking at Do...the curve on D looks quite
    monoline but on o you have a pronounced vertical stress. \r\nKeep going :)"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/critics005_5617.png]\r\n\r\nThanks for
    pointing out about the thickness of D and o - many of my uppercase is wrong by
    that matter, as they looka monoline.\r\nAbout the intended use - when I started
    I didn't had particular idea in mind. I knew that it will not be a font for body
    text, but that's it. And I see this font as for magazines, and maybe logo, as
    the flow for 'qactnumpdb' is very nice. But yeah, generally for magazines in 52pt
    and up. And it looks really nice if body text is serif(I will post some examples
    with next update).\r\nI will try out different approaches for making everything
    more even, as now I tried to increase vertical stress. But it looks weird, as
    for example S thickest part is = o thickest part, but it looks much more bigger
    :/ \r\nwill update soon!\r\nand thanks for comment! :)"

  body: S usually has the weight on the spine rather than on the bowls. Move it more
    towards the centre.
