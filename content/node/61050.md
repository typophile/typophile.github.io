body: "hi there,\r\n\r\ni am looking for a display face to be used for the nameplate
  of a newsletter. i want something that is friendly, approachable and young ( not
  too young tho!)\r\n\r\ni am redesigning a corporate newsletter and my instructions
  were to make it less corporate. the target audience are the employees of an oil
  company who's logo revolves around circles and paths. so i would like a typeface
  that reflects that in the title.\r\ni am currently going to VAG ROUNDED for body
  text and headlines.\r\n\r\nany suggestions would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanx
  in advance!"

    like FS Albert or FS Ingrid, were very friendly...

  body: "choose an open face (a and e with big counters, \"mouth\" wide open) from
    the Venetian, Garaldes or Humanist, not too light, not too much stroke contrast,
    maybe something slab or sturdy like Sauna will look more informal, also round,
    simplified forms (curved crossbar of e, one storey a etc) like in Speak (good
    idea) or Bree are possible, but rather not geometric. \r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/soft_rounded_sans/\r\n(scroll
    down)\r\n\r\nI would not go for something too soft like Cocoon or hand-made, since
    that possibly will look worn-out too soon."

  body: "wow! thanx for the response guys, totally appreciate it!\r\n\r\nive actually
    come across a really good typeface: ITC Serif Gothic BT , which seems to work
    really well. i love the serifs and the overall rounded form and feel like it has
    a nice arabic flavor which is exactly what im looking for, in addition to being
    friendly of course!\r\n\r\nhowever im not too sure about using vag rounded as
    body text at 10pt with 12 pt leading anymore. since the newsletter is  going to
    be distributed as a pdf i just dont think that font is legible. what do u all
    say? i might have a go at some of the typefaces everyone suggested in here. i
    need to find a suitable headline typeface and body text.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'thanx kupfers. what point size is suitable for screen reading? i know it
    depends on the typeface so assuming i stick with vag rounded as its one that has
    the look im after. '
