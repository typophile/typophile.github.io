    link]])  - apart from the F and the tips of the Z - that it looks like someone
    just rounded those off. The [[http://www.faustone.com/img/fuzz_unit_intro.jpg|new
    replicas]] use the original font though, but you probably know that... :)\r\n\r\n(Just
    passing through searching for Windsor-related posts...)"
