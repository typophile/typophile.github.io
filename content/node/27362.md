    can post to the number-plate collectors' list I'm on and see if I'm missing any.\r\n\r\nAre
    you just looking for serial (the letters-and-numbers) fonts, or every font used
    on a number plate somewhere? Kansas deserves a mention for going from Trajan to
    TNR Bold... with Papyrus on the personalised plates."

    Gothic</strong></a>, by Tobias Frere-Jones -- it shares the same aesthetic you
    were describing, although it was inspired by parking garage tickets rather than

    Yves, just re-read your first post properly (initially I just searched the page
    for \"Wright\"), Carplate doesn't look right at all, but Lineto's Alpha Headline
    is an interesting story. I've got some more about the origins of Charles Wright
