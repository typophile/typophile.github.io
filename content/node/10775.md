  body: ' I&#39;m surprised that no one has responded to this yet. I think these are
    really quite elegant forms. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if the little spiky cross
    strokes are really needed, so you might examine those if you decide to complete
    the font. At very least you might consider toning them down just a bit. <BR> <BR>The
    overhang of the lc &#34;a&#34; might be a bit overprominent, too &#40;or perhaps
    the bowl of the character is underprominent, considering the overall character
    width&#41;. <BR> <BR>I can see how some of the other glyphs might be especially
    fun to work out, based on the ground rules established by these characters. <BR>
