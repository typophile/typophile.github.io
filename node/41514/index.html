<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So I posted this typeface back in the summer and I received a lot of help and I think I have finalized it. I'm really happy with the letterforms but I wanted to see what some of you thought. It's obviously a display face and yes it does pay homage to Avant Garde. It was also designed based on a grid.
Let me know what you think. Thanks.

<div class=commentbody>It looks very interesting to me. I like it!
But I have some questions:
- Why do the apex and vertex of the letter N end peaked? In my opinion it should be like the M, V and W.
- The upper end of the G's throat seems to end above the arms and crossbars of E, F and H.
- Why did you fill the bold glyphs' counters? It looks like stencils, but why? It's not what the font looks like.
- I think, that the curly braces don't fit in your obvious concept. They don't seem to be created on the grid.
But nevertheless, I like the font! Especially, I like the M, Y and Q.
What about the lowercase?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Alfred, thanks! I'll answer your questions in order.
1. I made the vertices that way on the "N" because if I kept it consistent with the M, V and W, the "N" looks too wide. It didn't fit in and felt bigger than all the other letterforms. It also makes the N unique.
2. I see what you are saying but I can assure you it's aligned with the E, F and H. It's possibly an optical illusion, which I don't see, but I will explore it.
3. I filled in the counters to give the typeface a unique feature. I like it a lot, especially when the it's used at large sizes, but I'm also considering a version with counters.
4. The curly brackets were created on the grid and use the same corner angles and thickness as the rest of the forms.
5. I tried doing some lowercase letters but they weren't working out well in the grid but I'll revisit it soon.</div>
