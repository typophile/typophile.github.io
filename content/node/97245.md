  limited selection of typefaces is making the project feel stale and laborious.  I
  need some fresh typefaces!\r\n\r\nI am particularly drawn to hand-written typefaces.
  \ Not script, so much... but anything that looks like it was written by hand.  Fun,
  playful, fresh, etc... these are words I am drawn to.\r\n\r\nDo you have any recommendations
  that aren't going to break the bank?  \r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing your responses..
  thanks!\r\n\r\nJason"

    look handwritten.\r\n\r\nAlso, what you're drawn to isn't unimportant, but consider
    who it's for. Just yourself?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    And why are you using type instead of the real thing?"

  body: "I'm basically fusing a quote with an image, every day for an entire year.
    \ It's quite a lot of images so I'm looking to expand my type collection.  After
    nearly 300 images.. I'm hoping to bring some freshness!\r\n\r\nI'm not really
    looking for hand-writing, per se... just something to add some flavor.  It's a
    personal project so there is not really an audience exactly.  Some of the quotes
    are more playful or light though... so a typeface that reflects that would be
    great! (I assumed hand-written... but I'm open to other suggestions).\r\n\r\nI've
    enclosed a few basic examples of typefaces I thought reflected this 'feel'.  I'll
    post them in type ID ... but if you have any other suggestions -- it would be
    much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!  :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_3535.png]

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/blado/\">Blado</a>, all lower
    case.\r\n\r\nThe effect of using a foundry text type in display is that of the
    blow-up, a graphic effect which enhances the roughness of the image\u2014the same
    effect as that of using a \u201Chand-written\u201D face. There is something of
    the <em>objet trouv\xE9</em> in this, which gives it an artistic quality.\r\n\r\nThe
    no-caps setting, which was a popular concept in the 1950s, further serves to distance
    the setting from a commercial title or headline; there is something poetic in
    this, in the manner of cummings, and something modern, in the manner of Bayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think what you're looking for are closer to the keyword 'brush' than 'hand-written'.
    if you've got some time, have a go at with some paint, its quite fun. good luck.
