body: I have not been following this but myfonts.com has just recently come up with
  a program to create webfonts from any fonts a foundry chooses. Since I am a foundry
  I thought this is a great idea. I know I am out of the loop on this one but for
  one thing, what is involved in doing this yourself? What tools, software, other
  are involved? Was this a topic posted earlier? Sorry if this sounds a bit lame,
  but there it it.

  body: Myfonts does not seem to expect anything. Just say, it is a webfont. Then
    it is a webfont. It neither matters, if the font is hinted, nor if the user can
    access unencoded characters like small caps in a pro font.

    don\u2019t use. By the way, Charter Standard is more expensive than Charter Pro.
    And in contradiction to Charter Pro, some of the styles are available in packages
    only. However, Charter Standard looks bolder than Charter Pro on Windows because
    of the hinting. Even if I could license the single styles of Charter Standard,
    I would not do that because of the hinting."

  body: "@ Karsten\r\n\r\nGeorgia would be in the second place of my font stack. And
    with regard to backwards compatibility your argument is not valid, because in
    case of the layout features there is a solution (font splitting), while there
    is no solution in case of font embedding. OT layout rules are even not compatible
    to the actual browser generation. In other words: If I would use those CSS rules,
    my website would be compatible to the most used browsers in a few years without
    backwards compatibility. If I split the fonts, my website is compatible to the
    actual browser generation and in five years it will be backwards compatible. By
    the way you seem to forget, that web pages can be printed. And I have a few texts,
    that are intended to become printed. So I am not interested in fake small caps.
    And except from that I don\u2019t want to use Charter, because it looks nicer,
    but because it is more legible than Georgia in my opinion. Charter Pro really
    looks excellent. I simply will ask Bitstream, if they allow the splitting. And
    if they don\u2019t allow it, they simply don\u2019t get my money. I assume, that
    the foundries, which sell web fonts via Myfonts, want money. The \u201CI want,
    I want, I want\u201D is not on my side only. I only want a reward for my money.
    The reward is, that I am allowed to invest my time and my energy in splitting
    the font by myself. I even don\u2019t expect, that they do that for me. If they
    want to have just a restrictive EULAA. Bad luck, but not only for me."

  body: "It\u2019s the fear, that the user manipulates the typeface. I can partly
    understand that fear. But I don\u2019t want to change the typeface, but the font.
    And I think, a solution could be, that the license allows to change anything in
    the font, if the manipulator keeps the original font names, but adds the suffix
    <em>mod</em> or <em>modified</em>. And the user should add the information to
    the copyright sections of the font, that the font was manipulated by the licensee
    with the consent of the foundry, but that it is still the property of the foundry.
    And additionally this information should be stored in the CSS and, for the case,
    that the font is not base64-encoded, in an info-file, that is stored in the same
    directory as the fonts.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing, which I would like to change
    in case of some fonts (not in Charter) and that are the metrics. If I enlarge
    the letter-spacing with CSS by one pixel the letter-spacing is already too wide
    in most cases. But if I enlarge it by fractions of one pixel, it becomes uneven.
    This problem could be solved, if the user would be allowed to enlarge the letter-spacing
    directly in the font.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the design of the glyphs, I would
    be more careful, but I could imagine, that it would be useful to provide an extra
    CSS especially for print, in which a slightly enbolded version of Charter is embedded.
    I think, the only point, that is really important is, that, if the font is pirated
    from the website of the licensee by a potential other licensee, this potential
    licensee knows, that the font is not that, what he would get from Bitstream/Myfonts.
    Why? Because either the modified version of the font is better than the original.
    In this case the new licensee would be disapointed, if he licenses the original.
    Or the modified version is worse. In this case he may decide, not to license the
    font.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I only can say, that I have not seen one website,
    that was improved by a webfont for body text. Example: \"http://www.thomasphinney.com/\".
    What the hell has he done there? The website does not profit from the embedded
    font. It is just the other way around. Except from the fact, that the font is
    ugly, it is not well hinted.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is a thing, that is really
    absurd with regard to system fonts. It is absurd, that licensees of Windows are
    not allowed to embed system fonts in their websites. It is absurd, because websites
    are even displayed in system fonts on the screens of the big majority of all visitors,
    if they are in the font stack, but not embedded. And it is absurd, because a license
    for a system font probably costs as much or more as the whole operating system.
    And it is unfair, because those restrictions will let many thousands of people
    walk right into the trap of charged cease-and-desist orders. When you decided
    to become a type designer, one motivation probably was, to make the world more
    beautiful. In case of the internet the world is still ugly. There are so many
    websites overloaded with ornaments. They look like diversionary manoeuvres from
    technical hurdles like low screen resolutions. The ornaments are needed, because
    the text cannot catch the attention. And in the web empty spaces blend much more
    than in a book. In case of books I never have the feeling, that they look the
    same, although objectively they often look more the same than websites. Now I
    have lost my train of thought. Maybe this: If you only provide display fonts,
    that work with regard to the quality, in which they are displayed on screen, you
    just provide new diversionary tactics."

    I cannot understand, why someone can be in the opinion, that fonts look better
    on the MAC. So I don\u2019t know anymore, if Charter Pro would be really a good
    investment. But I dislike Georgia. On XP/Firefox it looks too bold and I never
    felt, that it is well legible. I think, I would go with Verdana, but I have some
    own poems and short stories and technical tutorials. I would like to use the same
    font for both, but Verdana is inappropriate for the poems and the short stories.
    I am in search for a neutral serif font, that harmonies as much as possible with
    all of my texts. And it should look good on all platforms. Seems to be, that I
    have to wait another ten years."

    Droid was a gift. And it would be too much expected, that the users check, if

    assume, that even in Case of Charter the foundry had bad chances in a German court,

    should pay. (But of course that means admitting most of it can be had for free.)\r\n\r\nAnd
    on the Webtype site, I'm also left wondering if they're delivering that whole

    a comparison of open-source font licenses - quite well put together and from someone
    I respect - that just left me shaking my head.\r\nSomething has gone fundamentally
    wrong.\r\n\r\nLicenses are private legislation, that's what they are. And if that's
    what we're going to rely on, it's not unreasonable to ask that it be clear what

    A Charter that looks good onscreen? Along with a small caps version to ride along?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    did not test all webfonts for body text, but Charter is extremely well legible
    on my system (XP with activated and tuned Cleartype). But when I saw it on Myfonts,
    it does not look good on Windows Vista and 7. I wonder, why. Maybe because I am
    using the Cleartype value 1.5 and Myfonts a bigger value. It has not necessarily
    to be Charter, but it shall be more legible than Georgia. My priority is the legibility,
    but not the specialty of my website with regard to the font. The user may not
    recognize the beauty of the font, that I use. If the typeface would be a bit more
    beautiful (I would not call Charter beautiful, but simply neutral), it would be
    better, but I assume, that beauty can be a hurdle for the rasterizer (if there
    are more details for example).\r\n\r\nI want to use the same font family for the
    whole website and I have very different kinds of own texts, poems, short stories,
    blog articles. (I become more and more political and there are certain themes
    like population growth, prenatal diagnostics, religious illusions and so on, about
    which I want to write in my own blog.) And I have technical tutorials like the
    translation of David Lemon\u2019s PostScript hinting tutorial to German (I spend
    round about fifty hours with translating and creating the images). I still have
    to ask David Lemon, if he allows, that I publish the translation on my website.
    Otherwise I will keep it private or write my own PS hinting tutorial. If I find
    the time, I am going to study Adam\u2019s TrueType hinting tutorial (maybe in
    a year), translate it to German and publish it likewise, if he allows. Why? Because
    nobody else seems to do it and if I want to understand this complex technical
    stuff, I need a clean translation for myself. So I am doing it primary for myself,
    but it is too good for not publishing it. Naturally in both cases with the names
    of the authors. But I want to publish it on my website, because my personal contribution
    was big. I could write my own PS-hinting-tutorial, but David has a very good writing
    style and although you probably see, that my English is not good, when you read
    comments like this one, the translation is very successful in my opinion.\r\n\r\nBut
    I am still in the beginning. I had a website, but I gave up a few years ago, because
    I felt too much pressed because of the technical limits; no CSS3, no font-embedding,
    no hyphenation for example. Fortunately these limits have partly gone. But meanwhile
    I have forgotten much. So I will need a while, probably at least a few months,
    until it is online. I hope, I am not getting bogged down in details. I want to
    try it with Wordpress first, but with an own template. I have ordered a web package
    a few days ago. (I can have as much MySQL databases, as six Gigabyte webspace
    allow. And the package is not expensive.)\r\n\r\nOn the other side I want not
    spread out my private data. I cannot exclude, that it ends up with a private website.
    I love and hate the word wide web and computers in equal measure."
