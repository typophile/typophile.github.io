		<div class="commentbody">A few things to consider: <BR> <BR>First of all, was there a contract? Doesn't sound like it. Does the invoice state a late-fee policy? I hope so. Late fees are important for two reasons: 1) It motivates the client to pay on time, and 2) it helps you keep the matter professional and allays some of the resentment you naturally feel (since the later they are, the more money you ultimately get). <BR> <BR>I would <i>not</i> post a snarky message on their website; that reflects poorly on you as a professional. As pissed off as you (understandably) are, you won't regret behaving professionally &ndash; and you might well regret throwing the tantrum you'd like to throw.  <BR> <BR>If you don't have a contract or a late fee to enforce, you might start by sending them a letter (does the UK post have some option for confirming receipt of the letter?) stating how many days overdue the payment is, and perhaps telling them that if they don't pony up within <i>x</i> more days, <i>y</i> action will take place. <BR> <BR>Action could be: bringing in the lawyers, stopping their email, etc. Whatever it is, make sure it's practical and professionally appropriate. And then, as with an unruly child, whatever consequence you promise, you <i>must</i> follow through with it. <BR> <BR>A final note: try, if you can, to separate their annoying-ness as a client with the nonpayment issue. The work is done, and it probably won't help get you your money if you actively hold that part against them. It does sound like a nightmare job &ndash; but in the future, some firm customer education up front as to your role can go a long way. <BR> <BR>Good luck! This kind of thing happens to most designers at some point, and it is a royal pain in the . Be persistent and professional, and bring in the big dogs if you have to.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Receivables are supposed to be paid according to the terms set by the vendor &ndash; not by some standard or average out there. F'rinstance, my invoice clearly states when a late fee will begin to be assessed and what the fee is. If I have to send a statement or follow up personally, I can refer to this.  I don't always use a contract at the beginning of a job (I should, but I don't), but when I do, the terms are in the contract and signed by the client before work begins. <BR> <BR>Bottom line: the vendor sets the terms, and the client agrees to them.

I don't think they will let it go that far, I'm sure they'll cough up before then. I'm just pissed off that doing someone a favour ends up like this.

		<div class="commentbody">It's helpful to make it clear on the invoice that there's interest levied on overdue invoices (1.5% to 2% per month is typical). That way, the money owed you by late payers is growing at a rate of 15-20% annually. Not a bad investment, assuming you get the money eventually. <BR> <BR>Various books on running your own design business suggest strategies for collecting late invoices. These include sending monthly invoices with updated figures (due to interest) and stages in which polite, hand-written reminders are followed by &quot;Urgent: overdue!&quot; envelopes and so forth. <BR> <BR>You want to avoid court and pissing off your client, if possible. Many clients buy services they can't afford to pay for - at least not immediately, and often a payment plan (with interest) can be worked out if you contact them directly. <BR> <BR>Lastly, make sure you have the documentation (a contract helps) available if you need to visit small claims court. <BR> <BR>[Disclaimer: This is mostly theoretical for me, since I have yet to have any significant clients be late on their bills.] <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, <BR> <BR>Without a contract (I use a modified version of the <a href="http://aiga.org/content.cfm?CategoryID=111">AIGA's Standard Form of Agreement for Graphic Design Services</a>) you have nothing in the way of legal recourse. I cannot overemphasize the importance of  this. A contract protects you and your client and lets them know your a professional. <BR> <BR>Also, I use a Project Planner/Client Survey/RFP type document upfront. After initial contact has been made and a potential client has expressed an interest in your services, have them fill out such a survey which forces them to really think about their goals, customers and competition. If they are unable to do this, that's a red flag. It indicates that they really don't know why they're doing what they're doing. Without a proof of concept, it's nearly impossible to create anything of value. At this point, you may want to meet with them in person to &quot;go through&quot; the survey. Some clients are better at talking about what they need than writing it down. Either way, the information (or lack thereof) provided in such a document/meeting goes a long way torward indicating weather the project is feasible. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if there charging 70quid for haircuts, they can afford your full rate. Don't EVER undersell yourself. <BR> <BR>At least you have control over the domain, so you can always just switch it off. <BR> <BR>If all else fails, send 'round Tony and Fat Polly to collect and &quot;forgetta about it.&quot;  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR> -t</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree with the absolute of having a contract or else.  Certainly having a contract with terms and conditions will be helpful if there are disputes over particulars.  But in this case, it's fairly blatant. <BR> <BR>Services have been rendered for which payment was not received.  In the US (I take it you live in the UK) we use a threshold of preponderance of the evidence in civil court.  Meaning, your only requirement to prove that things happened as you claim they did is to show enough evidence to make a case (not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt). <BR> <BR>In your situation that would be two things: <BR> <BR>1. The web site (with any additional evidence to show source code, proof of maintenance, etc.) <BR> <BR>2. Your typical hourly / project rate. <BR> <BR>By simply bringing it to court shows (beyond the preponderance of the evidence) that you are in grievance &ndash; so they can't use some concocted excuse that you agreed to do it for no charge. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, some clients are just not worth keeping around.  Send them a letter outlining your intention, put it to a timeline, and see what happens. <BR> <BR>Cheers.</div>
