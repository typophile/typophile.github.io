  body: '&#62;producing a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior
    design of the 1950s <BR> <BR>No era is a monoculture, so while this is technically
    correct, it is only partly true. It&#39;s interesting the way our cultural memory
    of the 1950s is changing. Presently, I would say that most people ignore the modernism
    of the 1950s, and think of it as a very retro, scripty era, or perhaps wonky &#40;that&#39;s
    for you, Tom&#41; and beat-mod, as in the &#34;Saul Bass&#34; lettering style
    &#40;done for him by lettering artists such as Art Goodman&#41;. Fontesque is
    usually described as &#34;fifties style&#34;, which really pisses me off -- I
    guess I&#39;ll have to wait a while for it to be called &#34;90s style&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>&#62;Eurostile looks modern <BR> <BR>There is definitely something very space-age
    and futuristic about the CRT-derived &#34;supercurve&#34; &#40;Zapf&#39;s term?&#41;
    that characterizes Novarese&#39;s Eurostile -- making it a favorite for data displays
    and signage in sci-fi movies. <BR> <BR>Sans serif typefaces have been described
    as &#34;modern&#34; since the 1840s, so it&#39;s a pretty meaningless term --
    particularly when one considers that the Didone class of types is also called
    &#34;modern&#34;! <BR> <BR>However, Richard is right. We should encourage designers
    to not just fudge things by using typefaces that are merely &#34;modern&#34; in
    appearance, but to specify ones that are actually of the present day. <BR> <BR>If
    not something more hard-core techno, Foundry Monoline or Paralucent should certainly
    be preferred over Eurostile, which has been used as the corporate style of a gazillion
    engineering firms over the past 40 years.  <BR> <BR>If EDF wants to position itself
    as a conservative, run-of-the-mill engineering company, Eurostile may be a good
    choice, but this is not the rationale proferred in the style guide. <BR> <BR>

    <BR>Because it&#39;s your job. A lazy, cheap designer &#40;and by extension, design
    profession&#41; ain&#39;t worth &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;. What are clients going

    by anyone with generic software? <BR> <BR>The old stuff is not &#34;perfectly
    good&#34;. It doesn&#39;t express the culture here and now. Or if it does, it&#39;s
    all about a bland, generic, world dominated by corporations that have no use for
    local idiosyncracies. <BR> <BR>As David Jury wrote in Eye, Summer 2001, &#34;Total,
    independent control of typography has been dropped in the lap of every graphic
    designer, yet the same technology sits on desks in every business and commercial
    organisation. The question will be asked more and more: &#34;Should I employ a
    graphic designer, or &#39;design&#39; it myself?&#34; Put another way; if the
    finer points of typography are not addressed, then what will be the difference
    between a graphic designer and an administratvie assistant, paid perhaps ten times
    as less for doing the same job just as badly?&#34; <BR> <BR>I would say that carefully
    choosing a contemporary typeface, and working with it &#40;learning how to &#34;play&#34;
    it&#41;, is one of those finer points that needs to be addressed. <BR> <BR>And
    if a UK company accepts Eurostile &#40;Italy, 1960s&#41; for its typestyle, rather
    than the local, contemporary Paralucent or Foundry Monoline, that&#39;s not representing
    for its own people, that&#39;s an insult to the culture of its customers. <BR>
    <BR>And with bland, generic design such as an ID that&#39;s a big off-the-shelf
    &#34;e&#34; &#43; Eurostile, used by a major corporation, hey, the message is
    clear, Who needs a designer, anybody can do that crap.'

  body: If that&#39;s the case, I trust that you never use any fonts older than, oh,
    say 10 years? <BR> <BR>This particular usage of Eurostile is bland, I&#39;ll grant
    you that, but that does not change the fact that Eurostile has a unique feel to
    it.  One that would be far more appropriate in some instances than any other font,
    and one that, though it is getting on in years, is still quite relevant aesthetically.
    <BR> <BR>I look at Foundry Monoline and see a typeface that imitates what Eurostyle
    was designed for.  Paralucent has a unique look to it, but again, to me it looks
    like an imitation. <BR> <BR>If a 50 year old font works for a specific project,
    use it.  Just because it is getting on in years does not mean that it is not still
    useful.  Especially considering that it is impossible to make a font today that
    does not have a &#34;feeling&#34; of a font from yesterday.  Consider this Paralucent
    which says it was inspired by Univers Helvetica, fonts just as old as Monostyle.
    <BR> <BR>Eurostyle is still a completely valid font despite it&#39;s age.  Using
    it does not mean the person who does so is a lazy or cheap designer.  And when
    you consider that that logo is for a large corporation, you should take into account
    the fact that large corporations work through committee.  Chances are the &#34;designer&#34;
    had barely any say in the final decision anyway.
