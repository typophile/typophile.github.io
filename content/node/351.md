  body: I <i>love</i> the new keyboard editor, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend installing
    it unless you have a definite need for it and are willing to take some time to
    figure out how it works. I made a Biblical Hebrew keyboard this week, from which
    I can input all <i>nikud</i> and <i>teamin</i>. Very cool. <BR> <BR>I will note
    that there are some bad presumptions in RichEdit that affect Office 2002, Wordpad
    etc. and which can cause problems with custom keyboards &#40;e.g. some combining
    marks not being treated as such&#41;. It&#39;s an odd bug, because the keyboard
    is actually working perfectly, and is entering the correct characters, but they
    are not being processed correctly. You can solve the problem by using the keyboard
    in a plain text editor and copy/pasting it into the RichEdit application. I&#39;m
    informed by MS that this bug is fixed in Office 2003.

    I&#39;ve been using a nice little freely-redistributable utility on the Windows
    side, but I&#39;d much rather use something more native. <BR> <BR>BTW, as far
    as I know there&#39;s an Armenian keyboard layout in Win-XP&#42;, but I haven&#39;t
    managed to find it. How do I activate it, and does doing so have any drawbacks?
    <BR> <BR>&#42; In fact, it&#39;s <i>mine</i>! A layout I toiled over for very
    many hours, to get it <i>just</i> right. I&#39;ve actually been trying to get
    MS to give credit where due... major stonewall. Any advice? <BR> <BR>&#62; RichEdit
    <BR> <BR>Wazzat? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>About the .NET stuff: Is there a reason
    <i>not</i> to install it &#40;except preserving hard-disk space&#41;? Should I
    worry that it gives MS some insidious hooks into my computer? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: <i>Is it substantially harder than let&#39;s say ResEdit?</i> <BR> <BR>It
    is a visual editor, so probably easier for most people to figure out than ResEdit.
    You get a diagram of a keyboard, you click on a key and up pops a character entry
    dialogue. There are various ways to enter character codes, including typing from
    an existing keyboard, but I usually use the U&#43;XXXX Unicode hexadecimal input.
    The aspect of it that may be confusing for some people has to do with understanding
    how keyboards work, and the relationship of hardware and software. <BR> <BR>You
    activate additional keyboard in Windows XP by accessing Control Panel / Regional
    and Language Options. Click &#39;Details&#39; on the Languags tab. This will bring
    up a window in which you can add a language and a keyboard/IME. There are two
    Armenian keyboards available, an Eastern and a Western. <BR> <BR>RichEdit is a
    system component for rich text layout. Wordpad is a RichEdit client, and I believe
    Office uses a custom version. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not aware of any reason not to
    install the .NET framework. In any case, it is going to be included in your next
    Windows upgrade, since it is a central element of Microsoft&#39;s new architecture.

  body: 'Actually, the version of ResEdit that I used &#40;2.1 or so&#41; did have
    a GUI, and it was pretty nice: on one side you had the keyboard &#40;where pressing
    qualifier keys opened up new &#34;layers&#34;&#41;, and on the other was the font&#39;s
    charmap; you drag-dropped the chars onto the keys. <BR> <BR>So it sounds like
    the MS thing might be slightly harder, but not much. <BR> <BR>&#62; You activate

    Is it a Home versus Pro version thing? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: That&#39;s weird. I didn&#39;t think that level of thing was affected by the
    Home/Pro distinction. But I&#39;m a professional, so I never run anything that
    doesn&#39;t say Pro. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
