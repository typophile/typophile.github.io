    an already compressed file is unlikely to make it any smaller.\r\n\r\nAlso wrapping
    an already wrapped SFNT font does not make much sense, but since MTX compression
    is now available under a \u201Cfriendlier\u201D license, it would make sense for
    WOFF to (optionally?) use it as it gives better font compression over plain gzip
    that is currently in use."

  body: On the other hand, gzip is common and there are libraries for many languages,
    so better stick to it. One downside of OT is that it offers many options in terms
    of some tables' formats which in turn means that supporting them is some work.
    And we are talking about a difference of a few KBs. I like the straightforwardness
    of WOFF, compared to the options that different EOT versions imply. If file size
    really matters, disallow webfonts (I do).

  body: "@dberlow\r\n\r\nRight, you can build either an EOT or a WOFF font with sfnttool
    but the input is always a ttf.\r\n\r\nPackaging an EOT font in a WOFF container
    doesn't work, the formats are different.  EOT uses Monotype's MTX compression
    which does things like pull the hints out from the glyph data and reinserts them
    in the decompression phase.  Keeping the hints together before applying entropy
    compression helps to reduce their size a bit compared to just gzip'ing a font,
    but how much will obviously depend on the structure of the hinting data.\r\n"

    defined in the WOFF spec. It must be a well-formed sfnt that can be losslessly,
    table-by-table compressed and expanded into and from the WOFF package. And EOT
    is another packaging format. Yes, it also contains an sfnt, but its own packaging
    means that it is not a valid input for a WOFF file.\r\n\r\n<em>Are there even
    such browsers/unupgraded IE users on the Mac?</em>\r\n\r\nI sure as heck hope
    not. Microsoft ceased development of IE for Mac in 2003, when Apple launched Safari
    and didn't renew their bundling agreement with MS. Did IE for Mac support EOT?
    I don't remember."

    of sfntly tools and for clarifying the EOT / WOFF differences\r\n\r\n@dberlow\r\nYou're
    right, OT does follow the SFNT structure, EOT is not. It has its own header followed
    by either raw TTF/OT data (as in EOT-Lite), or by MTX-compressed font data. Either
    one would not be considered a compliant input for WOFF converter, and it doesn't
    make sense to wrap one webfont format into another.\r\n\r\nWOFF is the standard
    format that pretty much all new browsers support. EOT is only relevant for older
    IE versions (up to and including IE8) that can only read EOT files. I don't think
    there is much concern about \"unupgraded IE users on Mac\", but there are still
    plenty of users using IE8 on WinXP - you need EOT if you don't want to ignore
    them (and sfntly tools from Google now allow everyone to do it easily).\r\n\r\n@Khaled\r\nMTX
    is now available under <a href=\"http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/mtx-license.aspx\">free
    for all</a> license - I don't think it can get any \"friendlier\" than that :)\r\nAnd
    I agree, it does make perfect sense for web fonts to use better compression technology
    whenever available, especially if the benefits of doing so outweight the implementation
    costs.\r\n"
