body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been given a project to design a poetry anthology. I've
  got a suitable typeface, and was planning on using an asymmetrical layout with wide
  left-hand columns (35mm on A5 paper).  The paper size was dictated by the client.\r\n\r\nMy
  problem is that all the poems are VERY different from one another and how I should
  best lay this out.\r\n\r\nLine lengths are as follows (all in verse)\r\n\r\n1 x
  6 lines\r\n1 x 8 lines\r\n2 x 11 lines\r\n2 x 13 lines\r\n3 x 14 lines\r\n3 x 15
  lines\r\n5 x 16 lines\r\n2 x 17 lines\r\n3 x 18 lines\r\n3 x 19 lines\r\n1 x 20
  lines\r\n2 x 21 lines\r\n2 x 22 lines\r\n4 x 24 lines\r\n2 x 27 lines\r\n3 x 28
  lines\r\n2 x 29 lines\r\n\r\nThen there are also a few longer poems:\r\n\r\n2 x
  36 lines (both prose)\r\n1 x 37 lines (verse)\r\n1 x 46 lines (verse)\r\n1 x 48
  lines (verse)\r\n1 x 99 lines (verse)\r\n\r\nWe are trying to give particular emphasis
  for each author (of which there are 38 in total), which means in reality they each
  need to start on a fresh page, rather than overflowing the poetry. I have been supplied
  with just 7 images. \r\n\r\nHere's a few pages of the layout (I think it needs a
  lot of improvement still, I've never designed a poetry book before)\r\n\r\nMy main
  problem is with the number of lines however... I don't want the short poems to look
  lonely, while the longer ones overflow uncomfortably onto the next page (which with
  fixed margins might result in just one or two lines flowing over which would look
  horrible). The solution of extending the page to include 29 lines also doesn't work
  very well aesthetically (see attached 40-41).\r\n\r\nHelp?? And thanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The layout looks pretty good to me; and I don't see a specific conflict between
    short and long text lines poems (this being a collective work, it is nearly unavoidable
    I guess).\r\n\r\nA couple of suggestion:\r\n\r\n1. I would increase a little the
    word spacing;\r\n2. On page 41, what does the last line \"Robyn Bolam\" stand
    for? Was it a sort of signature left there for mistake? If it is a line in the
    poem, instead, it is too close to the page number, which should have more white
    space above.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not enthusiast about featuring to different typefaces
    - but if it's your choice, then it's ok. Melville looks very nice, anyway - I
    haven't seen it before."

    poetic about that style.\r\n\r\nI don't think the short poems look lonely.\r\nThey
    command white space."

  body: "I design quite a lot of poetry books, and your layout looks fine to me.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the longer poems running into the page numbers is problematic in my eyes. Perhaps
    you could choose for the more conventional location of the numbers; in the bottom
    left and right corners? Maybe it won't look as harmonic, but at least you will
    have some breathing room for those poems that run a few lines longer than the
    rest. Another option is placing them in the middle on the side edges of the pages
    (i.e. in the left margin of the left page, and the right margin of the right page).\r\n\r\nI'm
    not a big fan of setting poem titles in all caps. A lot of poets I design books
    for use all caps as well, apparently they like it, but I nearly always advise
    them against it. I do often set them in bold or medium, but usually at the same
    size as the poems. If you want to differentiate them more, you could try indenting
    the titles. But I guess using a sans serif can also work.\r\n\r\nOn a side note,
    in your pdf v10, hyphens are being used instead of en- or em-dashes."

  body: "Letting poems run onto a second page looks fine. I like your body type a
    lot. For titles, how about a bolder version of the style you use for author's
    names, instead of all caps? Or if all caps, letterspace a little? Also, the subtitles
    or alternate titles should probably be in the same face as the actual titles,
    though the italic text face is very nice. On page 5 of your PDF, you probably
    want to use dashes \u2014 instead of hyphens -. I do think it;s far better to
    let a poem run onto a second page than let it run so close to the page number.
    For structured verse, break poems at stanza breaks, if you can."

  body: "Looks like the Sans Bold choice for poem titles isn't that popular here,
    Katy. :-)\r\n\r\nHere are some alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. If titles *must* be set
    in all caps, try to set them in the serif used in the poems as well, as others
    suggested, perhaps a bit spaced.\r\n\r\n2. Or you could try to set them in all
    small caps insted of all caps; they should look much less invasive on the page
    - perhaps increasing a bit the size (say, texts are set in 10, titles in small
    caps are set in 10,5 or 11, but do some prints of the page and have a look yourself).\r\n\r\n3.
    Finally, the most obviuos choice: set the titles exactly as the texts, uppercase
    and lowercase, again trying to increase them a bit (half or a point more than
    the poems)."

  body: "Hehe, yeah it would appear the sans are not going to win the election any
    time soon! Always good to have one decisive motion at least. :)\r\n\r\nThank you
    ever so much for the response! It really helps (especially on the en-dash, I obviously
    hadn't done anywhere near a thorough enough check)!\r\n\r\nRJ23359 Internal 36-39
    v5.pdf: I experimented with indenting the titles and it seemed to make the page
    a little busy. As for folios, my only concern with having them either side of
    the page is as you say the harmony of a symmetric folio layout against an asymmetric
    page design. I'm also wondering if I should tackle the margins for prose differently
    to verse. (you can see what it looks like in the standard format in the attached).\r\n\r\nI've
    also found a good poem to show my overflow problem. \r\n"

  body: "I don't think overflowing a poem to the next page is a big problem, although
    I usually discuss that with the editor, publisher or the poet. Because I found
    that poets especially have a strong opinion on where exactly their poem gets cut
    to the next page. If the poet in question isn't alive anymore, I talk to the editor/publisher,
    obviously.\r\n\r\nWith the prose on the last page... I do think the right margin
    is getting a bit narrow there. But I guess the only way to change that is to make
    the left margins slightly less wide...\r\n\r\nThe page numbers, I think this could
    work, definitely keep it in mind if you experiment further with them. :)"

  body: I think the new title style is a good improvement. If those asterisks are
    meant to be "section breaks" in the poetry, I would try a different sort of dingbat.

  body: 'The small caps / italic pairing for author and title works very well - literary,
    elegant, unobtrusive and effective. What doesn''t work, for me, is the page number,
    which looks more like a verse number, that way. I would try a more traditional
    placement (bottom of the page, centered; bottom of the page, left on both left
    and right page). '
