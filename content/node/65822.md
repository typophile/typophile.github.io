  body: Shango or Schneidler Initials for the serif. The Q looks like done by hand.

  body: "I think the Q is not a font. The serif is unusual in that the U is not contrasted.
    Golden Cockerel Initials is like this, but the C and E don't match. I seem to
    recall that some Gill serifs may have had this sort of U, but I need to look more.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Shango has a number of alternate glyphs, but I didn't see a matching U. I
    was going to suggest Gill Facia, which has an Alt U that has no stem, but the
    two sides are not the same weight, and the N doesn't have a full serif. Maybe
    Renko is right, but the U was fabricated by mirroring the left side of the U.\r\n\r\n-
