body: Has anyone used Scala Pro and Scala Sans Pro? Are you happy with the performance?
  How do they compare to earlier PostScript releases?

  body: "There is not only <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_scala_ot_regular/?acs=1\">Scala
    OT</a>\u2014which is an enhanced OpenType version and combines a number of the
    dated postscript fonts, e.g. expert (arrows, ligatures, \u2026), lining figures,
    small caps in one single font, with intelligent linking; but also <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_scala_pro_regular/?acs=1\">Scala
    Pro</a>\u2014which is an even more extensive font, also in OpenType format, with
    additional language support. \r\nYou don\u2019t need the latter if you don\u2019t
    have to deal with Baltic, Central European or Turkish text.\r\n(Same goes for
    the Sans, of course.)\r\n\r\nSee also <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/36876\">this
