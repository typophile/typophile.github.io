But the feel is much closer in Nobel than it is in Metro, especially the condensed face 'Actual Killer' above.

		<div class="commentbody">I believe that most newspapers from this era were still using the Linotype for their composition, though possibly not for headlines, which may have been handset or Monotype. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although WAD never designed italics for the Metro series, Linotype did release some. Undoubtedly these were developed by the drawing office, possibly by mechanical means &ndash; i.e., obliqued. The italic headlines above bear some resemblance to the Metro italics, but there are some distinct differences that I notice, particularly in the width and aperture of the 'C' and 'G'.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The roman, all-caps headline is not Metro, although it, too, bears similarities. The crossbar of the 'A' is too low. The crossbar on the 'T' is too narrow. The angled terminals of the 'S' are not Metro. A Metro 'N' and 'A' would have pointed vertices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't say what it is, however. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There were no condensed versions of Metro. The smaller, condensed headlines look like Erbar to me, though it's hard to tell at this resolution. Although originally designed for Ludwig &amp; Mayer in Germany, the Erbar faces did make it to these shores and were copied by Linotype. They were very popular for newspaper headlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're right. The condensed font isn't Tempo Heavy Condensed, it's (Linotype) Erbar Bold Condensed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only a few Linotype fonts were available over 36 point, and all of those were condensed. Erbar Condensed was one of the few available up to 60 point. It's quite likely that they used a Ludlow machine for headlines and the Linotype for smaller settings.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I mentioned above that Ludlow machines were similar to Linotypes, but they were very different in one important way: Linotype was automated and had a keyboard. On the Ludlow, the operator would handset the matrices (molds) for a line of type and the line would be cast as one piece. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ludlow offered fonts from 4 point up to 144 point, but nobody in their right mind would set a whole newspaper with one. They were mainly used for display type. I imagine they were popular at newspapers as an economical alternative to foundry type for headlines.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously, Linotype could be used for smaller display type as well, and this appears to be what's going on in the sample page.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tempo was modeled after Futura and similar typefaces. Ludlow didn't own Futura, so they had Robert Hunt Middleton do their own version. It's quite a bit different in the details, escpecially in the italics, but the overall impression is similar. Most noticeably, it has a two-story &quot;a.&quot; It's less geometric than Futura. In the lightest weights (Light and Medium), the italics have slight curves to some of the strokes and even sport alternate swash caps, and tails on some of the lowercase characters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I would love to do a revival of this face, but perhaps Ludlow UK is already on the case?)</div>

Newspapers used Linotype for setting the body copy and Ludlow for headlines. There is an old printer here in Houston still using a Ludlow. It is amazing to watch.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, Tempo is one font family that I would someday love to see make a full comeback in all its glory.</p>
<p>For years, many people dismissed Tempo as being &ldquo;just another Futura knockoff.&rdquo;  But there are plenty of noticeable differences:</p>
<p>*on Futura, the capital <!-- raw HTML omitted -->G<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has a full round body, with a relatively long spur; on Tempo the spur is quite short, and connected to the curve by a vertical line</p>
<p>*Futura&rsquo;s lowercase <!-- raw HTML omitted -->u<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has an unusual &ldquo;upper-case&rdquo; construction; Tempo&rsquo;s is more traditional</p>
<p>*In most (but not all) weights of Tempo, the lowercase <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has two-storied construction.</p>
<p>Tempo is also noticeable in that it is one of the very few sans-serif fonts in which the italic completely differs from the regular.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy I found this discussion&ndash; albeit four years later. I am currently assembling a book for publication, and I am indeed trying to format the titles of each chapter to resemble headlines from the 1950s/1960s. Not being a typographer, this is all very new to me, but I do have a firm idea of what I am seeking.</p>
<p>So what I can glean from this conversation is that what was mostly used was a font called &ldquo;Tempo&rdquo; in heavy and heavy italic&hellip;? However, this is not currently available in a digital form&ndash; only a condensed version in&hellip;?</p>
<p>Additionally, I am curious as to what the bylines, photo captions and main body of text used for a font or fonts&hellip;?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate any assistance I could receive.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Ryan</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From what I&rsquo;ve been able to research briefly, it seems that Corona, Excelsior, News Gothic and Franklin Gothic are all possibilities for newspaper body text. Can anyone confirm this? I&rsquo;m concerned with placing this within the late 1950s-early 1960s, so authenticity is important. It seems these typefaces were used with Linotype&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;d appreciate any help/suggestions with this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
