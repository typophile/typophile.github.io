body: "Hi All...\r\n\r\nI'm new here and don't really know \"font etiquette.\"  Hopefully
  someone can help me out with my question.\r\n\r\nI'm starting up a business creating
  greeting cards, invitations, announcements, etc.  I'm not sure what the best route
  is for me to go about purchasing fonts.  I'd like to offer a wide range of fonts
  because all my customers will have different personal styles.  Should I:\r\n\r\n1.
  Purchase a Font Package that offers various styles (although I\u2019m worried they
  may include too many that I wouldn\u2019t use).  If so, any suggestions for good
  font packages that would be good for all types of cards (wedding, birthday, holidays,
  birth announcements, etc).\r\n\r\n2. Purchase them individually as the customer
  picks them out.  If so, what is the best way to show fonts?  Online seems a bit
  ridiculous because there are so many, but I cannot think of any other way to show
  options since I would not own the font at that point.\r\n\r\nIt would be less expensive
  (in the beginning) to just purchase the fonts as each customer picks them, then
  I\u2019d be able to offer those fonts as my business grows. Hope these questions
  seem valid to someone.  I\u2019m new at this but have gone back and forth with which
  way to go.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\nLisa\r\n"

    out big bucks:\r\n\r\nBrowse the CDs for the various DTP software you may have.
    Many of them have a nice selection of fonts on the CD. For instance, Painter 7
    had thousands of quality URW PS and .ttf fonts bundled. If you are using PC OS,
    then there are also many quality .ttf fonts budled with some of the old cheap
    graphics programs like Print Artist. Version 4 Deluxe had thousands of Agfa .ttf
    fonts. Also look through any Hallmark software. Apparently some very good font
    designers have done work for them.\r\n\r\nThen you can buy a few selected fonts
    that are more versatile, with swashes and flourishes and alternates. Apparently
    the Bickham Script set is a must have."

  body: "Take a look at [[Font Starter Packs]]. It really depends on how much you
    want to pay; if you state that, it may be easier to figure out what you should
    get. The larger packages I've seen (Fountain, ShinnType, StormType, PSY/OPS) will
    run you between $1000 and $2500.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend you buy a set of typefaces
    and then have your customers pick from them; having them choose from unpurchased
    type could be overwhelming and overly expensive."

    want the whole face, they will apply the cost of the font you already bought.
    I think that's a great way to build your library without losing the benefit of
    a discount for buying the larger amount.\r\n\r\nIf that was clear as mud, you
    can contact Process. They are super nice.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "I recommend going with a collection. With this in hand, you can give clients
    the collection PDF so they have a list of options to pick from.\r\n\r\nAnother
    package to recommend is the FontFont <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontcds/ff_skill_set_advertising_packing_mac_ps/\">Advertising
    and Packaging Fonts</a> set. It's not bargain, but it's much less expensive than
    buying the fonts separately and you get what you pay for: quality. And I was personally
    involved with editing the collection, so I can confirm that there isn't any filler
    in there. "

    with over 100 varied and stylish fonts/families that you already have in your
    system. Have you looked at those?
