  curious about the Typophile typowiki Helvetica text, in particular\r\n\r\n<cite>Stempel
  and Linotype were not fond of selling a typeface that was named after a \"competing\"
  company (Haas)</cite>\r\n\r\nI haven't found this anywhere else, so I'd like to
  know who wrote it, and/or where the source for this assumption comes from.\r\n\r\nKindly
  yours,\r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: 'Hei Fredo. Uh, that''s long ago. I can''t see it in the revision list but
    I doubt I wrote the whole entry. It''s possible though that I reworked or added
    the part about NHG/Helvetica renaming. I can''t remember an exact source, at least
    not a book or anything I had it from but it''s probably something Alfred Hoffmann
    told me or I researched when I was doing the Helvetica Forever book. '
