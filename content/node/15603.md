body: "<strong>Syntax</strong>\r\n\r\nSyntax is a typeface designed by [[Hans Eduard
  Meier]] for in 1968 for [[D. Stempel AG]]. Syntax is a humanist sans serif, which
  was inspired by [[Sabon]]'s proportions. Syntax was the last new typeface ever designed
  by Stempel for metal typesetting.\r\n\r\nOver the next three decades, Syntax would
  be converted for use with photo- and digital typesetting systems. The typeface is
  available in digital format from [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1990s, Meier
  revised and extended his Syntax typeface, creating [[Linotype Syntax]]. Linotype
  Syntax has two additional serif companion sub-families: Linoytpe Syntax Serif, and
  Linotype Letter (an informal serif face). Linotype Syntax is part of [[Linotype]]'s
  [[Platinum Collection]]."
