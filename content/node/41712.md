body: "I just read [[http://typophile.com/node/41365|this]], so now I want to perform
  such a legibility test. Actually, I really want to test readability.\r\n\r\nI'll
  set the same word in different fonts, have subjects read through them in random
  order, record how long each took. I still have to decide what \"reading\" means
  here; I'll figure out the details over the week.\r\n\r\nI could also do the same
  for longer texts to test readability, but there are obvious problems with this:
  The text would need to be really long in order to measure legibility properly, so
  I'll have to come up with some way to account for the memory of the previous readings
  of the same text.\r\n\r\nI already know I need help determining how to account for
  differences in width among fonts for testing readability. How do you suggest that
  I account for this? Here are my only ideas so far:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adjust the width
  of the column such that the number of characters per line is equal for all fonts.</li>\r\n<li>Do
  not adjust the width of the column, but stop each line at the same place.</li>\r\n<li>Do
  not make adjustments to account for the different widths of characters, but test
  different column widths to see which fonts are best at which column widths.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll
  of the fonts should be set in whatever way is best because that's how anyone who
  cares about readability is going to set them, so, ideally, I should to adjust column
  width, leading, margins, &c. where such adjustment is appropriate.\r\n\r\nI'm also
  wondering what English words and text to use. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Cool, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_survey|people
  already do this]], except it seems like font hasn't been tested so much as general
  layout."

  body: "Before you create a experiment I suggest you talk a bit more with the folks
    already doing this kind of research so that you get an idea of what research has
    already shown so you can better understand what it would take to do a meaningful
    piece of research. Peter Enneson & Kevin Larson might be willing to talk to you.
    I applaud your enthusiasm; But as they say, \"Festina Lente,\u201D the Latin phrase
    meaning \u201Chasten slowly\u201D."

    before you start your own survey. \r\nAlso, I guess you need to set yourself a
    particular goal. \"Testing legibility\" or \xBBTesting readability\xAB is way
    too broad. You will not get any useful results when you don't focus on single
    parameters. "

  body: "When I'm developing news text faces, I pick an existing face as a benchmark
    and try to match the character count, with identical leading, column width, and
    h&j settings.\r\n\r\nI then try to match the apparent size of my new face to the
    benchmark.\r\n\r\nThis approach is necessary because my clients always compare
    my new face to their existing face, and want it to look \"as big\" -- which is
    code for readability -- if not bigger, and they don't want to lose words.\r\n\r\nIt's
    sometimes difficult to get an exact match, and the comparative settings may involve
    fractional point sizes and leading sizes. However, the main thing is character
    count.\r\n\r\nHaving done this, it's still not unusual for a client to nuance
    the setting once they have the finished font. For instance, I had optimized one
    typeface for 9 on 9.5, and my client bumped it up to 9.3 on 9.5. Another client
    decided that their face needed negative 10 tracking. Yet another likes to horizontally
    scale 95%!\r\n\r\nMinute changes to the polyvariant complex of size, leading,
    scaling, tracking and h&js can have a huge effect, which is why the idea that
    typeface readability can be reduced to a simple measurement is completely banal."

  body: I didn't do much research before I posted this. Now that I see that this has
    already been done a million times, I'll just play around with it so I can <em>see</em>
    the difference myself. I won't worry too much about whether the methodology is
    rigorous. I think I'll print some random phrases in different faces and sizes
    and see how hard they are to read from different distances. Later, I may also
    try setting random texts in different faces and timing myself to read them, but
    I still have to figure out how to choose suitable texts without reading them.

    your are not - reading. It might be a good idea to keep reading about methodologies
    as well. If your goal is not to compare readability though go with what feels
    good & maybe read Lawson''s "Letters of credit". And Bringhurst. See the books
