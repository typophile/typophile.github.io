    logos. But I\u2019m quite happy to see Hollywood\u2019s designers getting creative\u2014this
    stuff is such a huge improvement over the uncreative Photoshop-it-and-forget-it
    crap of 2007."

  body: "I've noticed that lots of them are using Bank Gothic, from memory, Star Trek
    in the credits, Transformers in the tailers, Wolverine in the poster (at least
    here in Australia)... i;m sure there is more but i can't remember them now.\r\n\r\nthe
    feeling i get is that for the sci-fi action type movies, the 3d metal looking
    Bank Gothic gives the right feeling of trust (they are known letterforms) but
    also modernity (future focused) and shapness (strength).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Movie font, then the Movie font and now the everything from chicklit to gravy
    granules (seriously) font it looks like Bank Gothic is the Epic Sci-Fi/Fantasy
    movie font for now ... Pretty sure Batman used it somewhere.\r\n\r\nCounting down
    the days before my milk carton comes with brushed steel effect Bank Gothic text
    on it ..."

  body: One caveat is that only Star Trek isn't really associated with metal, and
    that's just because the new ship seems to be made using polymers. Other than that,
    Wolverine is known for his claws, Battle for Terra seems to be dominated by a
    metallic ship of some sort, both Transformers and Terminators are made out of
    metal, and G. I. stands for galvanized iron.
