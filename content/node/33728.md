    are condensed, another is lighter weight) with the names Milano, Lafayette, and
    Webster. They all have lowercase as well.

  body: "To push this back in time maybe, the Petzendorfer book of Art Nouveau alphabets
    calls this 'Alexandra' from \"Bauer & Co.- Stuttgart & H. Berthold - Berlin\".
    I first recall seeing it for the titles of the Edgar Rice Burroughs books brought
    out by Ace Books in the early 60's. (It was a 'Xenotype' face in the Photo-Lettering
    catalogs).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
