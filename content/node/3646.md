  in London &#40;Highly recommended&#41;, I spotted this wall/desk calendar in the
  shop. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/28765.jpg"

  alt="Calendar Image2"> <BR> <BR>The magnetic circle can be positioned to surround
  the number. Really interesting shapes, anyone know of any other interesting typographic
  calendars?

    the year onto a single graphic the size of a CD -- that&#39;s why I can&#39;t
    find it, as I have CD cases all over the place, otherwise I&#39;d post a pic.

    Storm&#39;s circular calendar was a partial inspiration for the cover of the 2003
    P22 calendar... I don&#39;t have the Storm calendar handy...but it is amazing.
    <BR> <BR>---- <BR>also <BR>Pentagram does a large typographic wall calendar every
    year. <a href="http://www.kenknight.com/20caco.html" target="_blank">http://www.kenknight.com/20caco.html</a>

  body: Nic, that&#39;s a great calendar. <BR> <BR>The Typophile Calendar project
    didn&#39;t get enough steam to go anywhere in the short time before the end of
    &#39;03. Sadly. With some more time and some better incentives, we hope to resurrect
    it for &#39;05.
