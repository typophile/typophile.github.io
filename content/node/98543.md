body: "So the short story here is that I've inherited this logotype on a project and
  the designer used Levenim MT to set the Latin characters. However, that's a Hebrew
  font:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1889\r\n\r\nWhat's
  the best way to approach this?\r\n- Should I attempt to find and substitute a Latin
  font with identical glyphs? If so, which one?\r\n0r\r\n- Should I just accept that
  Levenim MT was chosen for its Latin character set?\r\n\r\nIt's a geometric sans
  serif and I don't believe the Latin characters are from Futura, because the lower
  case 'c' has terminals cut radially rather than vertically-sheared.\r\n\r\nI've
  run into this problem occasionally and the more general question I have is:\r\nAre
  the Latin characters displayed in non-Latin fonts:\r\na) drawn specifically for
  that non-Latin font,\r\nb) borrowed glyphs from another family,\r\nc) substituted
  by the OS (Windows in the Levenim MT case)\r\nor\r\nd) one of the above depending
  on the font?\r\n\r\nThe follow-up question is, when this happens, a designer uses
  a non-Latin font for Latin characters, what's the best way to identify the family
  of the Latin glyphs?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: "Most multi-script fonts fall into one of two categories: either the non-Latin
    is derived directly from a pre-existing Latin (typically resulting in an ugly
    and dysfunctional charicature) or a sort-of-compatible Latin is thrown in with
    a decent non-Latin (which is of course non-ideal as well). In either case outline
    theft could be involved.\r\n\r\nThe case with Levenim MT is clearly the latter,
    and since it's from a legitimate source one could feel safe that no outline theft
    was involved. The Latin seems to be a cross between Futura and Avant Garde - it
    doesn't match the Hebrew in style. Ideally you might find a Latin font that has
    the look & feel of the Hebrew - but it's going to be hard to match the color (for
    starters). The top-tier solution would be having just the right Latin custom-made
    (but that's not cheap).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>what's the best way to identify the

  body: "Thanks fvilanakis, looks like you got it exactly right with Century Gothic.
    This makes sense considering that Microsoft paid Monotype to develop Levenim MT,
    so they must have included the Latin characters from Century Gothic.  \r\n\r\nAnd
    I hadn't seen findmyfont.com, so that's a useful resource. Much appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    thanks hrant for clarifying the ways that multi-script fonts include character
    sets. It does appear to my eyes that the stylistic match between Levenim MT's
    Hebrew characters and Century Gothic is mediocre at best.\r\n\r\nWell done folks."
