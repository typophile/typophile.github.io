<div class=commentbody>It introduces a few new features...
1. Remote Desktop... it uses the wireless network card (802.11N) to connect to any other networked computer and "borrows" their optical drives. This will let you install programs from disk, or burn CDs/DVDs. But if you don't have one, Apple is offering an external Superdrive for $100 more.
2. The 1.6GHz and 1.8GHz processors are 60% smaller than their predecessors.
3. It uses a multi-touch input pad instead of just a mouse pad.
4. Used in conjunction with http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/specs.html, you don't really need much else.
I think it's pretty impressive. 3lbs and .76" at it's thickest point. I'm really more impressed with the technology and how it might factor in to the next iPhone.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Another problem - the glossy screen. I vastly prefer the matte.
I would never buy a laptop that was dependent on an external drive or a wireless network for such basic functionality as installing software or watching a movie. It defeats the purpose of having a laptop. My current laptop doesn't have a CD/DVD burner and it's a huge pain. Plus I think one port isn't sufficient, no matter how wireless you go.
I'd rather go for the 17" MacBook Pro which is marked down (refurb) from $2799 to $2199.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, the Time Capsule wireless router/hard drive/print server is much more useful and actually affordable (as Apple products go).
I think the technological aspect of the Macbook Air is larger. Easily imagine the applications applied to a touchscreen tablet. And the networking aspect with limited I/O support, might be a push for security and simplicity on behalf of the user. This is what gets me excited, what these features might mean for future applications.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@patty: The Air has one USB 2.0 port. Considering the fact that it has to be able to power that external SuperDrive, it’s reasonable to assume that it will power a lot of USB-devices with just one (unpowered) USB-hub.

<div class=commentbody>Also it seems a lot for the money considering it is actually only 0.24" thinner than the 1" thick macbook pro.
for almost half the price you can get an iBook with the drives and faster speeds all for an extra 0.32", but I do admit the innovativeness of the whole wireless takeover is great, and I do think it is the way forward.
In the same way as I look at the iPhone, I can't wait to see the second generation, that will truly be inspirational.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Another quick look and it seems to have lost the BRAUN influence. Can't quite put my finger on why, it seems to be a cross between a fighter jet and a clamshell mobile phone. About the optical drive, its going to be a hassle for existing DVD collections but I shan't be a luddite, this is obviously the way things are going! BlueStreak is right about that.

<div class=commentbody><em>Another quick look and it seems to have lost the BRAUN influence.</em>
Because that look depends on angular lines. But if you have a wedge shape and need to make it look even smaller than it already is, softer lines are better. You could also poke someone's eye out with a computer as thin as 4mm if it didn't have smooth bevels. Braun went to wedges in the late 70s and they were fashionable, horribly so, and didn't last long.
I've ordered my MacBook Air despite of its stupid name. I ride a bicycle to work and my Powerbook 15" is very heavy to take along, as it is on flights. I'm on an airplane a few times a week, so schlepping only half the weight around will make a huge difference. I use a big monitor both at home and at work with all the peripherals attached, so i don't need anything else. I do miss a Firewire connection, but then most small drives these days have USB 2.0 anyways. And when was the last time i put a DVD into my laptop? When i loaded Leopard. And how often does that happen? If one wanted to watch videos (which i don't), get them from a hard drive or use an ipod as external drive.
e
PS: disclaimer: i have a large collection of Braun equipment, like almost all their Hifi stuff from 1959 until the end, so i did quite enjoy having all that aluminum on my desk. Looks great with all that 60s stuff. And we still have the Braun calculator on the iPhone.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Jonathan Ive and Braun designer Dieter Rams share the same basic design principles, and I imagine Ive looks to Rams for inspiration often. Take a look at this article recently published by Gizmodo on the Braun/Apple connection:
http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future
My two cents on MacWorld08:
-MacBook Air is cool looking, but it lacks so much (ports, replaceable battery, etc…) that I can't imagine it being a very popular product for Apple.
-iPhone update was significant enough for me to delete all my jailbreak work, although I still greatly look forward to the SDK. Love the addition of group SMS and the mock-GPS feature works very well.
-Time Capsule looks very interesting. Too bad I JUST BOUGHT a new Extreme.
Nothing else really caught my eye, I thought Steve really disappointed us this year. I guess since last year's iPhone extravaganza, they are going to have to work extra hard to keep us interested. :)
The best thing about MacWorld is being in San Francisco and seeing the magic that is Apple marketing. I have yet to actually see the street teams in action (with the exception of coming out of BART this morning during the keynote and seeing all blank walls), but sometime during the keynote (every year, right on cue) every single available ad space along Market Street and in the Bart stations seem to automagically produce all the new Apple ads in a matter of minutes. You can go outside the moment the keynote is over and the city is just blanketed in fresh Apple material. I think it is brilliant.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Nothing else really caught my eye, I thought Steve really disappointed us this year. I guess since last year’s iPhone extravaganza, they are going to have to work extra hard to keep us interested. :)</cite>
Apparently you aren't the only one who felt that way - Apple's stock fell significantly today.
I realize we're all going wireless and this machine is probably forward thinking in that regard, but I need a machine that serves my purposes RIGHT NOW and that includes a disk drive and more than one USB port. I often plug a mouse into my laptop (I know, I can get a wireless mouse) and use my USB flash drive a lot. I just wouldn't want to have to lug around a lot of peripherals in order to use my supposedly portable device. And I get a lot of materials from clients on CD or DVD so without a way to put them in... not so useful. It's all moot (for me) anyway since a 13.3" screen is way too small.
Erik, I think we'll all be interested when you get yours to hear what you think!
Zara - I just read your post again - no replaceable battery??? Like the iPhone. Really, what are they thinking. We can't be sending our machines away to get new batteries. Of course the battery on my powerbook has been dead for years and I only use it plugged in. Which is one reason I need a new machine.</div>

The rest is not enough for a new MacBook. I doubt the MacBook Air will be that successful.

<div class=commentbody>Doesn't this critique sound like how everyone boo-hooed the iMac ten years ago? You know, not a strong or powerful computer, too expensive compared with the competitors' less-pricey models, aimed at a niche market, not expandable, screen too small, AND NO FLOPPY DISK DRIVE!
Jobs was right then, so I'm not going to write him off now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>but it's more expensive and less powerful than their own existing products, not to mention competitor's.
my question stands: what's the point ?
if it's just sexy slimness, it's not a viable workhorse - it's just a vanity accessory.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well Dan when they make the MacBook Air as good as the iMac, I'll get one. The early iMacs weren't powerful or expandable enough for designers, now they are. I'm sure this will be too, in time.
Expandability is less of a plus these days then it used to be earlier on, when computers were expected to last longer. Nowadays it's almost as cheap to buy a new one, and they come out with upgrades and speed boosts so often. My Mac IIci (a whopping $3500) lasted me 10 years. By the end it was only good for email and word processing. I've had my Powerbook since 2001 - it was the first Titanium and am due to replace it. But not with the Air.
Chris - it is a vanity accessory, but I know that for people who lug their laptops around all the time its weight is a powerful draw. My brother for example has been waiting for Mac to come out with a lightweight laptop.</div>

<div class=commentbody>while i certainly understand the practical limitations, i think this Air is conceptually quite forward looking.
as the sun CEO said years ago already (name?), the network is the computer.
what is really valuable is the information we have access to (whether news we can look up, music we can buy, or the vector data defining our artwork). our physical interfaces with the information will continue to become more immaterial.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is the 3lb weight including battery? I found when I was shopping for a small, light travel laptop three years ago that most of the specs gave weight not including battery. Since the battery is often the heaviest component in a laptop, it can make a significant difference.</div>

And in other news, the 2009 lineup for Apple is projected to have the new MacBook Vapor. At only 0.1" thin, the MacBook Vapor sports all of the features of the MacBook Air, only minus the hard drive, CPU, and display. The MacBook Vapor will ship in early 2009 and retail for only $2,399!

In a couple of months you’ll be able to discern whether a person has a MacBook Air or a regular laptop in his/her totebag by looking at the girth of the person: the former ones will be noticably heavier, haha!
