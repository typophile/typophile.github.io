body: "I have made some minor changes to OpenType Features Editor, and the new version
  is now available here: [[http://www.timrolands.com/More/Downloads.aspx]].\r\n\r\nI
  fixed some issues with the autogeneration of ligature feature rules and identified
  some additional fixes and enhancements to pursue.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know,
  OpenType Features Editor is a little tool I made to generate a features file from
  information in an AFM file. So you can export the AFM for a font, generate a *.fea
  file and import that back into your font development software. It's Windows only
  at the moment, but I have plans to make it available as a web-based tool as well.\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know if you encounter any issues with this release or have any other feedback.
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n-t\r\n"
