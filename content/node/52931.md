body: "Hi everyone...\r\n\r\nI'm designing a poster exhibition on the work of Cesare
  Cattaneo, an Italian Rationalist architect who worked in Como and Milan in the 1930s.
  The Rationalist school was led by Giuseppe Terragni; the Casa del Fascio is the
  signature building of the style.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to the source material for design
  cues... and having trouble identifying contemporary analogues to the typefaces used
  in the publications of the time. Mostra could work for display, but it's a bit too
  Art Deco - the rationalists were in line with the avant garde of Northern Europe
  (Bauhaus meets Corbu meets streamlined Italian industrial design).\r\n\r\nI'm leaning
  toward Futura or Helv Neue...the former feels more Italian to me and the latter
  has a greater range of weights and styles (at least on my machine...).\r\n\r\nYour
  two cents appreciated!"
