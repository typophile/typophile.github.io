    see this one. Updike's \"Printing Types\" did not show it either, as far as I
    could find.\r\n\r\nIt's probably reasonable to think it comes from a French foundry,
    but unfortunately, I have no good references for their specimens, other than the
    two books I mentioned.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    IIRC the rounded corners he calls a \"fad\" that some French font houses adopted
    to differentiate themselves from the damn Brits. I'll look it up in a few hours.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I guess you'll have to track down the Plon font house.\r\n\r\nThere's also nothing
    about what I thought I remembered, although\r\nI might have read that elsewhere.
    Don't ask me where though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "When I didn't find all of what I thought I would in Thibaudeau, I faintly
    started remembering that there might have been something in De Vinne as well.
    Well, lo and behold in his \"Treatise on Title-Pages\" of 1902 there's the following
    footnote:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeVinne_5530.gif]\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
