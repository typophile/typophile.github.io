    Kamekura</a>. :-)\r\n\r\nI don't have a positive ID for you, but here are similar
    faces.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/impact/\">Impact</a>
    comes close...\r\n\r\n...so does <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/extra-bold-condensed/\">Akzidenz-Grotesk
    Extra Bold Condensed</a>.\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful."
