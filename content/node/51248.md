    worse -broad edge pen influence no less!\r\nDreadful  :)\r\n\r\nYes, very nice.
    The light versions are particularly tasty."

    hogging the limelight! :^)\r\n\r\nIt really does deserve a wider audience though,
    I haven't seen it used anywhere yet. Get Monotype to push it more, like they do
    with Seb (Lester's) stuff in the UK - it's the least they could do after all the
    time, care and effort you took to produce it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

    well for the TP-interface.

    Do you remember what happened when we showed the heavy weight? Mayhem. Anarchy.
    People went blind. \r\n\r\nNote: all the prices are reduced!\r\n\r\n;)\r\n"

    laugh all over again.\r\n\r\nI should add... John McCain seems a fan of the stressed
    sans, not surprisingly since Optima has been around since the flood and we know
    he ain't computer savvy. Viva Gotham!"
