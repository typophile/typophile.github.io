<p>I am making a logo for a friend who is starting a business in investment consultancy. They are two partners. Young people, smart and openmined.</p>
<p>They wanted to get dynamic, modern but serious looking at the same time. Also trustworthy with elegant or luxurious touch. They don t want any tag line explaining the business which I think is a shame.</p>
<p>Def. not an easy task. I ve been busy with it for 3 weeks. All should be ready in a week and I am just stuck with too many ideas! All is explained in the entouchments. Thank you for feedback! A d really appretiate it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My opinions for what they’re worth.</p>
<p>The graphical elements in <strong>03.1</strong>, <strong>03.2</strong> and <strong>03.1a</strong> do nothing for me. I can’t figure what they’re supposed to represent — stylised |W|? in which case what&rsquo;s with <strong>03.1a</strong>? — and I don’t think any of them hang together particularly well.</p>
<p>Question: any specific reasoning behind not making the graphic a more direct representation of that graph? Straight-line elements only for some reason?</p>
<p>As far as the type goes, I much prefer that in <strong>02</strong> over that in <strong>01</strong>. I think it just looks more dynamic here however I’m not sure if that’s due to an innate preference for points on the |W|, but the wider spacing is definitely part of it; I do prefer the type in <strong>03</strong> over <strong>01</strong> for this reason.</p>
<p>Just to mention, the graphic in <strong>01</strong> (and <strong>01.1</strong>, which I prefer) may have unintended nautical associations for some viewers.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for comments. I have to admit I see some points you mentioned. Some letter spacing is wrong (I will take care of all details once I am close to final version). I know it s not an excuse.</p>
<p>03.1, 03.2 and  cosists of elements representing rise as well as letters I and W. But it s prob too many combinations. 03.1a should stand for some sort of securement. So that s to explain.</p>
<p>Question: any specific reasoning behind not making the graphic a more direct representation of that graph? Straight-line elements only for some reason?</p>
<p>I did try to make it more like the graph but at the end it looked like 2 bumerangs not forming nice shapes, but I suppose I dropped the idea too soon heading for more simplified elements. I didn t want to go too much into detail but maybe its too simple to make any impression at all. Good for pointing the nautical direction. And with all this blue. I will try to avoid the feeling.</p>
<p>So, now I have my enthusiamsm back thx to your useful comments. 
Let s see what I manage to do from the graph.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>

That said, I wouldn&rsquo;t have ever thought of anything like that graph from your icons. If that means that you took it that much farther beyond your inspiration then good. But don&rsquo;t forget to get back to your brief and ensure you are communicating the core message of the brand. What I am seeing in 01 is arrows pointing back and forth, a kite, skewed bowtie, triangles intersecting, and a graph depicting a slow rise followed by a sharp drop and another slow rise.</p>
<p>Have you tried to make a W from the letters IN. Seems like a simple type solution and possibility a allusion to WIN. It could easily take a form much like your graph ideas.</p>

The logo graphic in the first one has no connotations at all - it&rsquo;s just a pretty picture, which shouldn&rsquo;t be where it is. Instead, it should be vertically centered with the text, or else (with some resizing, possibly) be over the text, left aligned, or below the text, right-aligned.</p>

The triangls in the first one should express movement. The idea was just to make it dynamic.</p>
<p>In enclosed attachement I made the triangls appear more like a graph, by one I was inspired earlier. But it seemed a bit empty (1 to 4), that s why I picked the full form triangls (catch attention also).</p>
<p>Thank you also for the layout suggestions. It has to be horizontal. So, I changed the layouts by your suggestions. Hope I got it right this time&hellip;</p>

It should be a bit smaller and closer, it now looks very disconnected. In the outline version, the weight doesn&rsquo;t balance well with the weight of the text. It might imply motion a bit better if the central line were very slightly sloped.  I don&rsquo;t like the one that looks like a lambda at all!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The solid versions certainly seems more dependable. I wonder why you began exploring the triangles as movement. It also paints a nice story of zig and zag &hellip; zig when then market zags etc &hellip; though I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s wise investment advice, it seems like a nice story.
I also wonder why you decided to switch to outlined versions?  They seem to begin suggesting a loop. I understand the infinity symbol is a strong icon, but it is lost in this approach.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>the logo is chosen, but the guys came up with aditional word (trading) at the last moment&hellip;:(</p>
<p>Can someone try to choose which font fits the best? And also position? They wanted to have the word trading aligned with inwiz above. But in my view it feels a bit squeezed.</p>
<p>I wanted to make helvetica (I know but it s the only font that really fullfils my needs) more interesting. But the guys are quite conservative, so I included a version Helvetica/Helvetica as well.</p>
<p>I tried Garamond but they said it seems too romantic :(. I dont  think so, but &hellip;
Anyway&hellip;
It s not yet aligned, will do it all than (after I buy the font) for the word trading.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Thank you for any critique!
