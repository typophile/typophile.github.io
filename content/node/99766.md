  it be Miller? The Italics Subheads are also quite interesting. What do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/original_194783_jiN2mMJlF9aR_uaia0ySvafcp_5508.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: Is this really a spread that was printed in <em>Rolling Stone</em>? Not only
    was <em>surely</em> misspelled in the headline, but none of the apostrophes, em
    dashes, or en dashes output correctly. This would be unusually sloppy in any <em>Rolling
    Stone</em> article, but in an article about type design, it is, as Vizzini would
    say, inconceivable!

  body: 'It''s not Miller. Compare Miller''s <strong>F, W, e, R,</strong> and <strong>J</strong>
    with those in the sample. Miller is a Scotch Roman revival, with a fairly vertical
    stress. Even at such low resolution, it''s apparent that the text in the sample
    is an Old Style face with an oblique stress, similar (but not identical) to Goudy''s
    Californian type. '

  body: 'The only time I read <em>Rolling Stone</em> these days is in the barbershop,
    but if memory serves, they have a standard face that they use for the text of
    all their articles, regardless of the subject. It''s an Old Style face, very likely
    a proprietary version developed just for <em>Rolling Stone</em>. The Goudy article
    loks like someone imitating the style of <em>Rolling Stone</em>, rather than actual
    published pages, so I''m not 100% sure the text face in this sample is the same
    one they use in the magazine. '
