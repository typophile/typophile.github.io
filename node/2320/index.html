		<div class="commentbody">Here is a side-by-side comparison using MT Clearface Gothic Demi. I can see that a number of letters (C, c, M, and w) besides the g are not identical to Clearface Gothic (CG). However, the similarity is hard to escape, so I think we are looking at a customization that started with Clearface Gothic, and possibly 'borrowed' characters from other fonts, or made new/modified ones. It may be a 're-design' of  CG, although the resemblance gets closer if you stretch the type wider, starting from a lighter weight (which I don't have).<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21911.gif" alt="ClearfaceGothicCompare"></div>

Back  <BR>in FontShop we bumped into those quick-steal-jobbies  <BR>all the time. As Mike explained so well, all they did was  <BR>change the most distinctive characters into something  <BR>else, slant the roman instead of providing true italics, <BR>digitally extrapolate some extra weights, maybe add  <BR>an outline or rounded version, and bingo: <blink><b>1000 fonts  <BR>for $24.95</b></blink> whattadeal! <BR> <BR>[edit] <BR>I was a bit hasty in my phrasing: it should read &quot;URW  <BR>Agenda is a <i>version</i> of Clearface Gothic&quot;. Sorry, my bad. <BR>I was convinced that the sample was not URW Agenda  <BR>but one of &quot;those quick-steal-jobbies&quot;. Excuse me for my  <BR>error of judgement of both URW and the ID.</div>

I admit I didn't look at URW Agenda, as I picked up this thread later on, and now that I have I can see that it's the the re-design of Clearface Gothic that I talked about in my previous post. I agree with you that it is a better match for the non-g letters, and I stick with my suggestion that the g was modified (from Cheltenham, which is another M.F. Benton typeface?) in order to make the typeface look 'new'. Now I'd say they started from the URW 'adapatation' of CG that they call 'Agenda'.</div>

We're all musicians:  <BR>a little over 10 years ago my sister started playing  <BR>clarinet in the local Harmony band. My brother, who  <BR>didn't play any instrument back then, met his wife  <BR>there, a multi-instrumentalist (clarinet, keyboards  <BR>and now bass tuba). After a couple of years he picked  <BR>up the trombone. They asked me to join as percussionist. <BR>My wife's brother -trombone too- was next, and he  <BR>brought my  then future wife in, who plays keyboards  <BR>and saxophone. My wife's brother started playing in  <BR>a second Harmony band, where he met his wife, a  <BR>flute player. Confusing, innit? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The Claude Coppens concert is Thursday.

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, I found your <b>g</b> William! Read on &hellip; forgive the rant. <BR> <BR>I've got to speak up here. If somebody who knew no better were to <BR>read this thread as it stands, they'd leave thinking that URW is a <BR>scumbag font pirate company. I'm <i>really</i> not trying to be contentious <BR>here, but I'd like to clarify some things. <BR> <BR>Yves, you lumped URW into the same paragraph (next sentence, <BR>in fact) with &quot;those quick-steal-jobbies&quot; and then &quot;all they did was <BR>change the most distinctive characters into something else, slant <BR>the roman instead of providing true italics, digitally extrapolate some <BR>extra weights, maybe add an outline or rounded version, and bingo: <BR>1000 fonts for $24.95 whattadeal!&quot;. This effectively equates them <BR>with Southern Software or Bay Animation or any of those other crooks <BR>who renamed fonts and sold CD's full of them at a pittance. <BR> <BR>Now surely you weren't speaking of URW here. If so, I'd honestly <BR>like to learn what it's based upon. Specifically, <a href="http://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=agenda" target="_blank"> URW Agenda</a> has no <BR>italic, much less a false one or outline or rounded variants. I'm not <BR>aware of them doing this with other typefaces either. <BR> <BR>Secondly, Clearface Gothic is attributed to Morris Fuller Benton. URW <BR>also offers <a href="http://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=clearface" target="_blank"> Clearface Gothic</a> and gives proper attribution to Benton, <BR>1906. So why offer Agenda as well, if it's meant as a thinly veiled clone? <BR>Agenda is attributed to <a href="http://www.urw.de/english/schrift/wahl7-set.htm" target="_blank"> Phil Martin</a>, who, prior reading has led me to <BR> believe, was no slouch when it came to designing  at least a few well <BR>known and well used fonts in an earlier era.  <a href="http://mm2000s.net/index2.shtml" target="_blank"> See here especially</a>. First <BR>hit the Font History button and be ready to hold your cursor over the <BR>Stop button in this awkward presentation (at least Agenda is the 2nd <BR>font shown). Mr. Martin makes a statement much like Mike's about the <BR>letter 'g'. Now hit the Font Graphic button and behold the very 'g' thought <BR>to be &quot;homemade&quot;. <BR> <BR>So, Martin takes a 1906 typeface and, in 1976, makes several significant <BR>modifications to it. Absolutely he ought to have credited Benton. Two years <BR>later, Victor Caruso takes that same old typeface and digitizes it. <BR> <BR>My beef here is that, while I detest the folks like Southern Software who <BR>steal, rename and sell, there are so many gray areas to this topic. What <BR>occurred with Agenda has occurred to varying degrees with many, many <BR>font foundries, some of them large and well respected. An existing typeface <BR>was modified, sometimes precious little and called something new. Even <BR>worse, in my opinion, has been perpetrated: <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html" target="_blank"> 1</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsia.html" target="_blank"> 2</a> (Thanks for these articles, <BR>Mark. I'm sorry if you didn't intend them to be used this way). <BR> <BR>My intent is definitely not to paint Monotype black, but to show lurkers who <BR>don't know better that ethical gray appears in lots of type foundries and to <BR>call, say, ITC and Monotype the good guys and, say, URW and Bitstream <BR>the bad doesn't do justice to any of them. I've seen, recently, Bitstream, <BR>Corel and, now, URW labelled flatly as fiends, as if it's a known fact</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike,  <BR>Thanks for uncovering that story. Mr Martin seems like a bit of an eccentric, but aren't we all?  <BR> <BR>My understanding of many of the URW fonts was that when they had one of the few (along with Bitstream) places where foundries could get typefaces digitized (with their tool Ikarus), they made a deal that they could sell every font they digitized as long as they changes the name (hence all the Latin-sounding names for familiar-looking fonts).   <BR> <BR>So Bitstream and URW truly do not belong in the bucket with other 'cloners'. I don't know what the Corel story is, although you say they made a deal to allow them to sell all these fonts re-named? Can you point to anywhere that this is documented just so I can clear up my own impression of them? <BR> <BR>As for the other foundries imitating the fonts of others, this is a practice that goes back to early type history.  I would love it if a type historian could unravel some of the 'genealogy' of many of these fonts.  Linotype's &quot;Memphis&quot; is an example of a metal type they created in the 30's to compete with Monotype's &quot;Rockwell&quot;, so that they could offer the same kind of typefaces to their customers (I think I named the right fonts with their foundries, but apologies if I got it mixed up). The point being, just as in Marks tale of the Arial's of Monotype, that foundries are just as determined to keep abreast of their competition as any other business is. Still, these are newly designed, if not original, and not literally copied from each other's masters, and I think our intent in slamming certain suppliers (I can't call them foundries) is that they have no skill to design anything. They just copy the work of others and market it at prices that devalue all the other fonts, and give an excuse to folks who think if font companies can be corrupt, why is it wrong to steal fonts.   Aaarghhh! <BR> <BR>This has been an interesting thread, and again, Mike I think you were right to make your points and it was great work to find out the story of that 'g'. Now I wonder how it survived to be in the sample that William posted?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought it might be one of Phil's. There was something of  <BR>his style to it and I knew that he sometimes did derivitive  <BR>designs such as this.

It is one of the earliest writings on Aesthetics. And don't worry, it's very brief, lighthearted and fun.
