  college.\r\n\r\nI posted this as my Facebook status:\r\n\r\n<cite>Thomas Levine
  is appalled at Cornell University's use of Arial in the \"Congratulations\" banner.</cite>\r\n\r\nThen
  I posted [[https://selfservice.admissions.cornell.edu/images/Accepts.jpg|this image]]
  with the following comment.\r\n\r\n<cite>I think they normally use Frutiger everywhere
  else. Why did they have to use Arial here? If they have Frutiger, they must also
  have Helvetica.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat really was the first thing I noticed after I
  realized that I had been accepted."

  body: "My logic is that if someone in the university has a license for Frutiger,
    the university must also be able to afford a Helvetica license for this person.
    They could have used Frutiger for the banner too, but maybe they wanted it to
    look different.\r\n\r\nOf course, the person who created that banner probably
    chose Arial just because it was the default. If the person had had more time,
    he probably could have gotten someone else with a license for a better font to
    make the banner. (Of course, I don't care <strong>that</strong> much about the
    font they use in the banner.)"

    Standards design standards can  be  pretty much up to each faculty and within
    faculties, it can be a dog's breakfast. Academic staff don't want to be bothered
    with such details. Admin staff are too busy to care. \r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
