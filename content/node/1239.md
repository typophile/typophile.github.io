body: Hey, this is my first time posting here, but I&#39;ve read your critiques for
  a long time and have always valued them. I was just playing around with the idea
  of a new logo for my firm, and came up with this - and want to know what you all
  think. Thanks! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15936.gif"

  body: Thanks, Chris. Do you think the design &#34;works&#34;? Or does the legibility
    work against it too much? <BR> <BR>I was trying to go for something abstracted
    far enough that it&#39;s more of a <i>design</i> than just <i>initials</i>, but
    I know that a logo also shouldn&#39;t need an explanation for it to work. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for the comment, and I&#39;d love to hear more crits!

  body: The only thing I&#39;d point out is that those narrow slits have to size-sensitive
    &#40;wider for smaller sizes&#41; to avoid closing up. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thanks HHP. I&#39;ve got a slightly altered version for when it gets down
    to really small sizes. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15948.gif"

  body: 'It is an interesting form. There are two things about the form that are unsettling
    to me, but only on a personal level: &#40;1&#41; the form looks like it&#39;s
    going to roll/tip over to the right, and &#40;2&#41; for some reason the curve
    at the bottom of the &#34;f&#34; isn&#39;t working for me &#40;unfortunately,
    I am not offering any suggested resolutions tonight&#41;. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: 'I&#39;ll work on a version of the logo without the curve &#40;on the &#39;f&#39;&#41;,
    but it&#39;ll still look like it&#39;s going to tip over. I don&#39;t know if
    that&#39;ll bother other people or not - I didn&#39;t even really think about
    it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sort of wondering if I should just stick with the logotype
    on the temporary page 2 of our site: <BR><a href="http://www.furtherstudios.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.furtherstudios.com/</a> &#40;just click the splash,
    no need to read the outlandish manifesto-esque text unless you really want to&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again.'

  body: Okay, here&#39;s version 2. One question - you don&#39;t think it looks too
    phallic, do you? A better question is, you wouldn&#39;t have thought it looked
    phallic if I hadn&#39;t mentioned it, would you? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15957.gif"

  body: i like the old logo, with the tops of the letters shifted to the right.  it
    looks hot.   <BR> <BR>this new one is not memorable enough.  and something about
    those straight white lines going thru it makes it look just... weird.  it&#39;&#39;s
    not helping it form space and dimension, it&#39;s just breaking it up in weird
    places.  an FS monogram may be cool, but i dont think this should be it...

  body: Your old/current logo is much stonger. The f/s mark is now saying &#34;Korean
    paperclip manufacturer&#34; to me. Your current logo is &#34;hot&#34;, as Loren
    put it, but could probably still use a little attention &#40;i.e. font selection
    and vertical spacing of &#34;studios&#34;&#41;. I&#39;m anxious to see your site
    when it is finished. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: there&#39;s a great logo - in my opinion, of course - Suomi-Yhito - a Finnish
    insurance provider. i&#39;ll try to post it later. this logo can give an idea
    about stylized letters. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>David Hamuel

    abstracted far enough that it&#39;s more of a design than just initials, but I

    <BR>Thanks for the comment, and I&#39;d love to hear more crits!&#34; <BR> <BR>For
    normal usage you could put the symbol and then right next to it &#34;further studios&#34;,
    then for places where it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate to have the text you could
    just use the logo.  It is definitely unique and memorable, so I think it would
    work fine on it&#39;s own. <BR> <BR>I like how the S cuts into the F on the new
    logo, however I think I like how the F and the S meet at the bottom on the old
    version.'
