    here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/%28New+Baskerville%29/fonts/\r\n\r\nWith
    the term \"compressing\" I mean to make the letters narrower, which can be done
    on any typical illustrator application like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw or even
    an image processing application like Adobe Photoshop."
