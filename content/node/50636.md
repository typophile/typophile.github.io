  tight and I've got a small problem here I think\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project
  in two languages. Priva is one of the typefaces selected for the project, and noticed
  something a little weird with certain characters.\r\n\r\nOne of the strange things
  here is that the charcter \u2018B\u2019 in priva looks a little weird. Compared
  to Charter in this image and other typefaces we have, it looks different. Is this
  some sort of alternate version of this character?\r\n\r\nThis other is that in Priva
  the character \u2018\u044D\u2019 gets inverted and looks like the western \u2018E\u2019.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  here ever dealt with this situation?\r\nAny recommendations? Sadly, budget's tight\u2026
  and looks like we can't change the typeface as this is the typeface the client uses
  on their material.\r\n\r\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1ig5.png\r\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture2du7.png\r\n<img
