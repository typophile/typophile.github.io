  Encodings\" by Yannis Haralambous. \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/40164\r\n\r\nAs
  you may recall from that thread, I was dismayed to find that the book had some serious
  typographic errors in the code listings. Other people also pointed out errors they
  had found. Not only that, but the book was not yet available in electronic form
  on O'Reilly's website.\r\n\r\nFirst the good news: The book is now available to
  view online (for free if you own the dead tree edition) through O'Reilly's Safari
  Books Online service:\r\n\r\nhttp://safari.oreilly.com/9780596102425\r\n\r\nMore
  good news: The errata file for the book has been updated (previously it contained
  only a few minor errors).\r\n\r\nThe bad news: The code listing errors are still
  in the book, and are listed so far only as \"possible errors\" in the errata file.\r\n\r\nIn
  spite of the still-to-be-corrected errors, I think this is on balance a very good
  thing. Considering the shear amount of material in the book (over 1000 pages), having
  it available in electronic form (i.e., searchable, being able to copy snippets of
  code, etc.) makes it more useful by a magnitude.\r\n\r\nGiven that the errors are
  now listed (however tentatively) in the errata file means that they will likely
  be corrected eventually, so there is hope on that front as well."

  body: "Excellent news. I was one of the people who griped about the size of some
    of the errors, but I'll be the first to say that if the bugs are ironed out, this
    could be *the* resource book for technical font info.\r\n\r\n"
