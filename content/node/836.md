body: Greetings <BR> <BR>Can I get some advice about which Bodoni to buy ? Do you
  have a preference and why? <BR> <BR>And in general, I am baffled about this question
  whenever I go to buy a font where there&#39;s more than one version from different
  foundries / vendors.  Are there certain companies that are considered better than
  others? I read a lot of ITC bashing -- should I steer clear of their products? &#40;I
  have managed to figure out that ITC Garamond looks pretty dated.&#41;  Is Elsner
  &amp; Flake Bodoni considered superior to &#40;say&#41; Bitstream and Linotype,
  and that&#39;s why it&#39;s more expensive? <BR> <BR>Any help you can offer me is
  greatly appreciated.

  body: As far as I know, Bauer Bodoni is supposed to be a very good version of the
    typeface. Don&#39;t ask me more - I have no idea why. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
