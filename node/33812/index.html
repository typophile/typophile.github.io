Not sure you need periods after the job titles and bullet points - they are not sentences after all.

I'd make the hyphens under AWARDS into M-dashes for consistency. 

I like its simplicity, especially compared with some of the nonsense you see from students. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The indent of Bachelor of Science, Graphic Design might be a bit much, at least pull it back to line up with your bullet points.

The bottom 3 columns of Course Work, Computer Skills and Personal Skills seems awkward. The spacing between them doesn't seem right.

On the second pass, I would agree with Patty that the type is heavy. You might want to consider using some ruled likes to break things up abit. 

If you do use some lined rules, set the stroke to the mustard yellow used in your logo and then set your bullets with a fill of the same.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This does look very good. Just a few thoughts, really:

- The section titles seem very large and create a heavy bold spot in the experience area as you have the Office name bold as well. Does this font have small caps? What if you  use all small caps and made it smaller with a little spacing?

- I'd use the vertical space. Align the top and bottom margins.

- I'd also make the left margin the large margin, not the right. Think of the recto page in a book, not the verso.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's my (rather blunt) 2 cents worth...

I don't think there is enough areas of solid body text to warrant a secondary headline typeface. Maybe do them in the regular of the font you've used for "DESIGNER & TYPOGRAPHER".

Lose the m/n dashes. They're ugly and break the flow.

The spacing above and below the rules are both inconsistent.

The position and size of the whole 'block' of text on the page seems a bit awkward and cramped.

I think your logo and name should share a baseline.

Too much space between the 3 columns at the bottom.

I don't like the colour split in your name.

Not too keen on the use of italics.

The text under 'Personal Skills' is higher than the other 2 columns.

Sorry to be presumptuous but I couldn't resist a bit of tweakage. See what you think :) ...
