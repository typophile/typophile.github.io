    although I don't think it looks familiar to me.\r\n\r\nBlue Vinyl's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/eye-catching/|Eye
    Catching]] is similar. I am still looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    to some P22 scripts like Gauguin, although this looks a bit more amateurish compared
    to those."
