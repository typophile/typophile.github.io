body: 'Background <BR>The high level problem I am trying to calculate the width of
  a line of text for a given font. I am generating a dynamic PDF using fpdf.org&#39;s
  tool. FPDF utilizes PHP files among other things to generate the PDF. I can use
  this PDF to generate the length of a line of text given the definition. I&#39;ve
  provided two sample definitions below, one for Arial and one for Amazon &#40;a script
  font&#41;. <BR> <BR>Question <BR>My problem is I want to make sure I&#39;m understanding
  what all of these variables are first. I don&#39;t understand what the following
  variables are:  <BR>flags  <BR>ut  <BR>up  <BR>stemV  <BR>As you can see from the
  images below, Arial isn&#39;t really caluclating correctly, but Amazon is. The reason
  I don&#39;t think Arial is calculating correctly is because the ration between the
  EM Square =2692 and the EM Width &#40;width of an U.C. &#34;M&#34;&#41; =833 be
  SO far apart. Am I misinterpretting the numbers and/or variables? <BR> <BR>FOR DETAILS
