  Will I get Adobe Garamond Premier (with the Opticals), Adobe Jenson, and Minion
  with Creative Suite 3 Standard? How about Creative Suite 2.3 Standard/Premium?\r\n\r\nI
  did see the recent threads about <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33096\">Arno
  Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33092\">Hypatia Sans</a> (but I
  want the Slimbach classics!).\r\n\r\nOlli"

    including the regular Adobe Garamond. Check this out: <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/type.html\">Bundled
    fonts in Creative Suite 2</a>.\r\nYou may optionally download Garamond Premier
    Pro (with opticals) for free (as a registration incentive\u2014just as Thomas\u2019
    Hypatia now with CS3)."

  body: Thanks, Florian, but I did know all that. I was wondering specifically about
    the 2.3 version, and the CS 3.

    thread</a> on the Adobe forums, suggesting that Garamond Premier still comes with
    CS 2.3.\r\n\r\nBut what about the promised list of bundled fonts for Creative
    Suite 3? See <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc3a49f/2\">here</a>.
    Thomas, please?\r\n\r\n<strong>Add:</strong> Oh well, I'm looking to update from
    InDy 2 to Design Standard CS 3, and I guess there's no comparable update to Design
    Standard/Premium CS 2.3 anyway (I don't have Photoshop). Please correct me if
    I'm wrong!"

    Premier Pro: regular, italic, semibold and semibold italic. No Adobe Jenson Pro.
    11 faces of Minion.\r\n\r\nWe'll have the full list up shortly.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Achtung! No Jenson Pro? That's what I was afraid of when I started the Arno
    Pro thread! What is the reasoning behind dropping one of the best typefaces in
    Adobe's catalog from the bundle? Sure, Arno is great, but at the expense of Jenson?
    I dunno if I like that. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if there are 4 weights of Garamond
    Premier Pro, why also include the same weights of Adobe Garamond Pro? THAT doesn't
    make sense to me."

    designers already have legit licenses for Adobe Jenson left over from previous
    Adobe software purchases. While it would be nice to see Arno as just an addition
    to everything else, it\u2019s better than just expecting people to keep paying
    for the same fonts over and over."
