  body: "To me, that's not a font rather a custom job based on a commercial one. I'd
    probably start with some neutral sans like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Avenir|Avenir]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura|Futura]], keeping /B, /e and /s (the
    only letters I think that are still untouched) and customized all the rest.\r\nOut-of-the-box
    alternatives: [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet|Chalet]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/all-round-gothic|All
    Round Gothic]], [[https://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/dessau_pro|Dessau]]"
