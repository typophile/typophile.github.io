  give me a critique of my new portfolio design, on the typography especially. This
  is just a flat comp and will eventually be a working site.\r\n\r\nVersion 1 (Large
  jpg 1.2MB)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nVersion
  2 (Earlier version, a few changes, large jpg)\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout15.jpg\">http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout15.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJamis"

  body: "I'd say spell out \"small to medium\" instead of \"small-medium\". Also,
    that swash on 'You' does nothing but break up the sentence. Get rid of it.\r\n\r\nWhy
    is the word \"DESIGNED\" in small caps under the pictures? It doesn't stand out
    enough to be a link, and it stands out too much to be just normal text.\r\n\r\nGo
    with the brown \"Website Design\" at the top right of each picture instead of
    the orange.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "@Lex: Thanks for the feedback. I agree with all of your comments. I've made
    those changes.\r\nI removed the swash from then end of \"you\" but added one at
    the beginning. Let me know if you like it.\r\n\r\nIn response to your question:
    \"Why is the word \u201CDESIGNED\u201D in small caps under the pictures? It doesn\u2019t
    stand out enough to be a link, and it stands out too much to be just normal text.\"\r\n\r\nAnswer:
    I wanted highlight what I had done on those projects without having to make bullet
    points. So I used small caps to make emphasis to those. Do you think this treatment
    is not accomplishing that effectively?\r\n\r\nI've made the changes and re-uploaded
    the file.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJamis

  body: "I think it's looking better now.\r\n\r\nThe small caps in the middle of a
    sentence like that just doesn't work, at least for a website. Maybe try italics
    instead, but I really don't think any emphasis is necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso, I assume
    you'll edit your real copy so that every other sentence doesn't begin with \"also\".\r\n\r\n
