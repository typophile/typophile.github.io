  the Sony Connect logo (attached). Im working on a logo for a home alarm and software
  company that doesn't really know which leg to lean on, the alarm leg or the software
  leg and I shall try to combine theese two into one logo and still keep the message
  clear. So, if you have an idea of a font that feels like software and safety at
  the same time I would be happy to read your suggestions. Thank you.\r\nPetter"

    out and might make people think of Pepsi.\r\n\r\nIf it's just for a logo, you
    might consider taking a normal square sans and rounding it yourself."

    Though they both indeed feel dated, they still might provide a starting point

  body: "Thank you all for your suggestions and ideas. I have left the idea with rounded
    E:s since I thought that the word came apart, DETECT is the word. PTL Notes works
    well with its slightly rounded corners and I like it alot but its quite close
    to the original logo and the client wants a total makeover (without graphics).\r\nUsing
    capital letters, which I think enhances the security feeling, doesnt really work
    that well because the Es and Ts are very stiff and simmilar and doesnt really
    give the word very much of the fonts \"character\". The word really only consists
    of D and E since the D/C and E/T are simmilar shapes. Ive been trying to do something
    with the D and C but I dont really like to fiddle with existing fonts to much
    but I think I will have to since Im not allowed to create any graphics. "
