  body: "I haven't tried it out yet, but I went to a meeting/ presentation last week
    presented on-line by Extensis. \r\n\r\nThere were a lot of participants, so not
    all questions could get answered. It did look pretty impressive, especially for
    larger companies. I liked the way the end user client can see several preview
    fonts at once and easily scale them as well. It seems like it extensive on features.
    It even keeps track of license agreements for fonts to some degree. I think they
    said that was for end users only as they didn't want to get into a position of
    being font police.\r\n\r\nI'm not real clear as yet how it deals with font caches.\r\n\r\nStephen"
