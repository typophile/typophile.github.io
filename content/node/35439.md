  body: It looks kind of like a Eduardo Recife wannabe. It just needs to be more thrashed.

  body: "I just spent a while searching the most likely 'suspects' -- Alejandro Paul/Angel
    Koziupa, Rob Leuschke and Jason Walcott -- using the same letters. I didn't find
    anything that was even very similar at all. (I didn't look at Letterhead, because
    I didn't think this style seemed similar to their work). I also searched Part
    7 of the Script Guide (Casual Connected scripts) and didn't find anything close
    there either.\r\n\r\nBased on all that, I am leaning towards hand-drawn, unless
    you have some evidence (like repeating letters) that shows that this is really
    a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
