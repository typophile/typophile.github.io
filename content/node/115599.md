  body: "@Hrant it's ironic or you're serious ?\r\nIn fact, I've seen lot of criticism
    on my Twitter timeline (on the buzz purpose first but also on the design)\r\nOn
    my side I'm not a type designer but at first view, I like the modifications that
    have been done on the curves. The overall shapes looks like more balanced to me.
    And I find the angular version quite interresting. \r\nBirdseeding your link doesn't
    work :/"

  body: "I think it's strange how it didn't occur to me to design a \"better\" Comic
    Sans to at least partially fix the whole Comic Sans hysteria. I like the result.
    If people feel the need to use a wacky font for obituaries I would rather see
    Comic Neue than Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nIf Comic Neue is to replace Comic Sans though,
    I suspect Comic Neue will quickly be hated for the same reasons people started
    hating Comic Sans, which is primarily not the design itself but the context in
    which it's (ab)used. I think we would hardly have given Comic Sans any attention
    if it were only seen in the context it was designed for. My main irritation has
    always been the unlucky choice of using Comic Sans in various dubious contexts;
    the fact that it's not a beautiful font is a secondary issue. So, while Comic
    Neue is more formal than Comic Sans, the main issue actually hasn't been solved.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    casual. It\u2019s free. And nobody will reflexively make fun of you for using
    it.\u201D \u2013 Time.com\r\n\r\nOh Time, how naive you are..."
