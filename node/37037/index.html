  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hi you all there

my name is johnny. i'm graduating in visual comm. / typography at the basel school of design in two weeks.

I'm fully a fontlab- and FEA-novice, but i've drawn a font - and i need a RANDOM glyph substitution to get to work in it - that puts me in trouble at the moment.
if i don't have that feature in the font, the whole thing is half as good/relevant.
i just opened an account in typophile to talk with experts and find the solution

my situation is quite similar to steffens in http://typophile.com/node/17887
just with the need of RANDOM added to it.


my concept is simple:
for each letter i drew 4 stylistic variants in fontlab 5 studio - then while typing the generated font, for example an A, it should each time just take another A out of the 4 alternatives there are.

i get this to work, in the way that i can choose an alternative A in the glyph window ("alternatives for this glyph") in InDesign

i tried the feature "substitue <glyph> from <glyphclass>" , putting all my A-variants in a glyphclass
it works. BUT IN INDESIGN IT ALWAYS JUST TAKES THE VARIANT THAT IS FIRST IN THE LIST OF THE CLASS.

then i found the typophile discussion linked above and tried twardochs suggestions with the salt-feature and ss-feature
works in the same way but HOW DO I GET THE RANDOM INTO IT ????

hope someone can help me!
thanks a lot

johnny

As far as I know, and this idea has been nixed by the OT partners for 15 years, there is no desire on the part of the owners of OT to allow TT fonts to contain potentially dangerous software like that which is required to do what you desire.

this is how the the "sub from" syntax works.
there is no way to get "real" randomness in OpenType (unless you somehow build your own plugin for the application, that does what you desire) but you can acheive some level of pseudo randomness.

there are several threads here on typophile discussing how to achieve this effect, i'll let you wade through them yourself:
http://www.google.com/search?q=random+site%3Atypophile.com

if you want someone to implement this for you, you might contact [[tal leming]]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">ok, thanks!
that's helpful - i'm reading the discussions you linked me to.

question back to paul:
to build my own plugin, what kind of programming language and software is needed for that?
not that i dare to try it myself, but i have some programming-skilled students around here that could help me.
would that be a fontlab-plugin or an indesign-plugin?

that's the direction of the fourth result in the google-search you suggested, and tal lemmings suggestion at the same time. (he advised me to do this after i emailed him quickly for advice and information about his possibilities in implementing. as you probably know he has a licensed robust random simulation algorithm - encouraged me to solve it myself though as a student. that's also my aim and challenge actually.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">that's surely right.
my time is a bit short to try many ways, but this i will surely do with the font later on.
for now i need some suitable "randomness" or alternative behavior for the presentation of my font in 10 days. parallel to that i also work on the lettershapes itself again - as the whole thing is about the different negative spaces i get through the alternative glyphs. my font is for posters, large type size.
so now that i know i can get the alternatives in there, I'm doing more letterdrawing again to precisely work on the font's specialty of those variable spaces.
could imagine that in the end i take it out of pseudo-randomness to control (that might seem random) with lots of contextual glyph sub scripting - so that interesting spaces will happen that i explore now (also through the randomization)</div>
