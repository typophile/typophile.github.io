  and fun.  It embodies a high degree of contrast between near hairline horizontal
  strokes and bold vertical strokes.  The family is offered in three widths and in
  regular, small capitals and title faces.  Use Paragon to lend impact to your next
  design project.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Paragon_Gallery_1_6643.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/compton/
  | Compton]] is a clean modern slab serif face that emphasises simplicity of line
  and legibility.  It's offered in three weights, regular, bold and light.  Compton
  brings the spirit of th 60s and 70s to the present day.  It is ideal for clear simple
  graphic design that makes an immediate impact.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Document1_4748.png]\r\n\r\n"
