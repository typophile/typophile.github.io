    in 2000 I collected more than a dozen newspapers to analyze their typography.
    Only one was Good, but ironically the worst one by far was that of the Writers
    Union! Maybe writers care too much about writing to care enough to reading. Hmmm,
    sort of like chirographic type designers eh?  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
