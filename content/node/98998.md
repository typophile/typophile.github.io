  body: While not an article or book, Pedro Amado put together a pretty comprehensive
    [[http://www.typeforge.net/blog/2011/11/24/font-formats-timeline/|infographic
    timeline of font software and formats]], which could give you a starting point
    for further research.

  body: "That is a nice chart.\r\n\r\nThe first post, though, referred to the subject
    in a way that I found odd - it seemed as though the OP was looking for a chart
    that would show the kind of typeface design software in use at the time of, say,
    the Battle of Hastings. \"Throughout history\" implies that something is shown
    over the entire span of time since the invention of writing, as opposed to only
    throughout its own history."

  body: Well, from the battle of Hastings to the beginning of this chart is just 11
    little blips, then 5 larger ones and then metafont. :)

  body: "I have found an essay from the Department of Computer Science at Stanford
    University, <cite>Letterform Design Systems</cite> by Lynn Ruggles, a PDF of which
    can be downloaded using the link below (this link will trigger a download depending
    on your browser):\r\n\r\nftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/83/971/CS-TR-83-971.pdf\r\n\r\nIt
    includes an overview of the InTeractive Synthesizer of LetterForms (ITSLF) designed
    by H. W. Mergler and Y. M. Vargo in 1967, the first system in Pedro's infographic.
    I have only just started reading through this but it actually addresses your initial
    request very nicely."

    a few other platforms not on the timeline.

  body: Sorry, I should have looked beyond the flashy graphics! You may find, if so
    motivated, that the best way to proceed is compiling that information yourself
    based on (amongst other things) the incredible range of first hand sources to
    be found on Typophile and in the wider and very friendly type community.
