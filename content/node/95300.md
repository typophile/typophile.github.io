  Bold Condensed.</strong> [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=folio%20bold%20condensed|There
  are so many!]] Linotype, Elsner+Flake, URW, Bitstream, Scangraphic... I prefer versions
  that also offer a Bold Italic weight.\r\n\r\nWhich version should I consider or
  avoid at all cost? What are the differences between them. I'm not exactly looking
  for the most accurate version. Just the most well balanced.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    on what specifics you're looking for, and nobody can answer that but you.  They
    have different character complements, some differences in punctuation glyphs,
    and some subtle differences that only a discerning eye like yours might see.   And
    the same typeface, from the same vendor, may undergo changes and improvements
    as time goes by.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest comparing them as best you can, side by side,
    and making your judgement call.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Herb and Indra.\r\n\r\nI understand that Folio is a precious witness
    of a past era, and that many foundries digitalized it.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about
    Bitstream, since I heard (sorry, I don't have the source) that they distributed
    an imperfect copy of Folio under the name [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bitstream+swiss/fonts/|Swiss
    911, 921, 924]]. Should I avoid these (Swiss 721 being a Helvetica knockoff)?\r\n\r\nI
    also came across <strong>Folio BQ</strong>, but I can't find the source. Anyone
    can help me confirm <strong>Berthold Quality</strong> actually had a Folio version?\r\n\r\nThanks
    !"

  body: "Yes Berthold had an extensive Folio family. The copyright dates start in
    1992. The italics appear to be obliques rather than true italics, but so are Bitstream's.
    They're not in Berthold's current sales list.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Adobe stopped
    marketing Berthold's fonts. However they are now marketing their own collection
    of Folio fonts (not to be confused with The Adobe Font Folio) .  I have nothing
    to base this on, but maybe when they separated, Adobe got custody of the Folio
    family, and Berthold got everything else.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: Swiss 911, 921 and 924 are no versions of Folio, rather, they are different
    versions of Helvetica (Compressed and Inserat) and Hansaetic. I only the know
    the Bitstream version of Folio, which seems alright to me, tough I have not used
    it until now. The URW version is a good deal as well, with wide language support,
    and a couple more weights. From my experience the URW fonts usually are good quality.
