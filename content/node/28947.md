body: "Our site, arabetics.com, was recently upgraded to introduce more options for
  Arabic and Arabetic scripts users.  In addition to adding more fonts and the ability
  to edit and display extended Arabic scripts online, using any of our fonts, we have
  also introduced on the site a java applet demonstrating our new alternative Arabetic
  editing method: NAIM\r\n\r\nThis new input method option is a \u201Cshaping\u201D
  free (or glyph substitutions free) natural Arabetic text input method.  User sees
  no glyph changing prior to leaving a word. Additionally, we have added an option
  for users to force RtL only ordering to avoid bidi behavior when desired: http://arabetics.com/java/NAIM.html
  \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther discussion of this method and other related topics are included
  in our latest article in the upcoming issue (40.3) of Visible Language: \u201CTypography
  behind the Arabetic Calligraphy Veil\u201D.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-Saad"

    Arabic Glyphs?!\r\n\r\nBoth, it is not dependent on that. I made sure to test
    it with 2-4 glyphs per letter too. It works with any font.\r\n\r\n>>Are you going
    to market NAIM physical keyboards along with NAIM Software?!\r\n\r\nFor now we
    created a java applet that serves fonts, keyboards, directionality, and input
    methods, over the web to demonstrate our project. But NAIM is just a method.  It
    can be implemented within hardware or software, or even using OT features (with
    application software aware environment)\r\n\r\nIt's main goal to make a user and
    learner not overwhelmed by awkward glyph changing so he/she can concentrate on
    learning the shapes. \r\n\r\n>>Then, Arabic is a Digit Hopping System. Arabs read

    you say that Aziz.  That is exactly what we have been saying for years: bidi did
    not solve the insolvable? It just made typing Arabic awkward, and added unneeded
    overhead.\r\n\r\n-Saad\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on the screen what he/she first hits on the keyboard, A stand-alone Letter on
    both?!\r\nBut with NAIM he/she does not see what he expects by the first hit.
    Instead he/she will see a different shape \u2014 the initial form of the letter\u2014
    unless of course he/she spaces it for example? Right? Or have I made more funny
    questions?!\r\n\r\nNumberwise, I do not see any awkwardness in the current Arabic
    System. Numbers go naturally and smoothly as long as you are in the right (to
    left) direction that has been made not to toggle by accident as before. Mistakes
    in numbers can be easily corrected as well.\r\n\r\nThanks with <a href=\"http://www.crAUSwords.com/flowers/WFlowers.htm\">Flowers</a>\r\n"
