  so go easy on me\r\n\r\nI am creating a business card for a new hair salon called
  Gemini and I have come across a font that I really want to use.\r\nUnfortunatly
  I can't fit it into the said budget. I really like the Chalet series from House
  Industries and was wondering \r\nif anybody could recommend a similar or cheaper
  alternative to the one I have posted.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    Grotesque</a>\r\n\r\n*If you're using only one font style, you certainly save
    money this way, but it sounds like you're designing an identity package for your
    client. In which case it would serve you well to purchase more than one weight
    and perhaps italics. The price per font is often much lower when you buy a package."
