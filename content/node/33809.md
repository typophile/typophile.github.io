    body: 'A tree service company. Full-page ad. They''ll have 3 pictures of trees
      with one saying "Large Hazardous Removals" then "Attention to Detail" and then
      "Superior Clean-Up & Customer Service". I want something that stands out from
      the rest of the fonts used. I''m actually thinking maybe not cursive after-all
      but something like Balloon. '
