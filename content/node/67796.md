  time and I just wanted to say you guys are amazing! I'm a design student working
  on a film festival poster right now for Jean-Luc Godard. My logo type uses <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/poster-sans/\"
  >Poster Sans</a> and I was trying to find a supporting typeface or family that pairs
  well with it, preferably sans serif (which I understand is hard to do successfully).
  I really appreciate it!\r\n\r\n-Nick "

    Gothic]] or for a nice geometric sans, that's especially good for text, there's
