  in an engraving shop.  I have a font dilemma, I am currently working a project for
  a customer and need to find out what font is used for the 2006 Liberty Silver Dollar.
  \ I have searched high and low and am not able to find it.  Is this a special font
  used by the Tresury Dept?  I would appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nThank you for your
  time and assistance.\r\n\r\nJesse "

    that one would be custom. <em>( I dont think noone ever used existing, available
    type for money and currencies. )</em> Anyway, If you could post a sample image,
    someone may actually be able to help you with alternate typeface suggestions.\r\n\r\nDav"

    body: "I didn't think any coins used type, either -- I figured the lettering was
      always designed by the sculptor who designed the coin. But you're right! They
      used both Univers and Arial. What a disgrace. The Arial doesn't even curve evenly:
      the type is too big for the arc it's sitting on. Shame! They spent about $2
      Canadian to design the coin.\r\nI bet Robt. Bringhurst won't even carry those
      coins in his pocket.\r\nAs for the US dollar coin, since it's a reissue of a
      design from the 1920's [assuming I am thinking of the same coin you are] the
      letters are hand-drawn. Those were the good old days: in 1907, Teddy Roosevelt
      chose Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a famous American sculptor, to design some coins
      for the US Mint, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the coultry's coinage.\r\nAccording
      to Wikipedia, the dollar coin was designed by medalist Anthony de Francisci,
      a naturalized immigrant from Italy.\r\nFont Bureau's Grand Central has some
      of the flavor of public lettering of the early 20th century..."
