  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">    Making deadline's is tough, at times it seems no one really cares about making it aside from you and the pub's sales rep who is breathing down your neck. I try and explain it to my parents or my girlfriend or my dog. They don't get it. They're all, "Ya good job" but really they have no idea of the mental anguish I've been putting myself through. First off you get the call from the publication. 
"It was due yesterday" they say very casually at first then gradually more towards screaming obscenities over the next 25 times they call. They don't care that your job sheet says it's due next fall, or that your spinal meningitis is boiling up, or that your AE is a drunken football hooligan who just threw your computer into your windshield when you asked him to "work on an extension". "It was Due yesterday, and the page in question goes to press in 15 minutes" Next, in a frantic state of rage and shame and overwhelming hunger you dial every number you can think of, the client, the client's assistant, your boss, your Auntie Ella, the kid who works at that spot down the way that sells those little jalepeno cheese joints-you know the one's, and they all say the same thing "call you back in 15 minutes". Now it's go time for real, you run outside, jump through your nonexistent windshield en route to the only place at which this runaway train can be stopped-The press. You get there soaked in sweat mumbling senseless babel to the press operator. He doesn't understand your chatter and refuses to stop anything so you make that split-second decision and hurl your now limp and unattractive body into the press ending the foray in one spectacular display. Unfortunately it was a digital press and instead of killing you it merely bruises your face and neck a bit. You return to your office defeated and alone. Horrific as it may seem, I live this reality monthly, maybe even bi-weekly, and it's fo' serious. DEAD-Lines make hero's and break lesser men/women into sweaty little bits of men/women and thats the trail we tread.  </div>
