  body: "Many thanks for your speedy reply Scottie. I had a look at Optima but the
    slightly cupped terminals on the Capital T cross bar and the variable widths on
    some of the uprights like h and l are not quite right....will keep looking. Agree
    that whatever it is has probably been condensed.\r\n\r\nKind regards Bronwyn"

  body: "Thanks heaps Antoni - I had only looked at Optima (which I have), not Optima
    Nova (which I don't yet have). I think you are right - it has the slightly different
    a and s.\r\nAppreciate your help guys - both on the Optima Trail!\r\n\r\n"
