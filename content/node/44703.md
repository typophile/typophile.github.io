  department at UCLA. I am comparing the photographers, Robert Capa, and Henri Cartier
  Bresson. I was looking to use two fonts in a book that will include my analysis
  and comparison of them. Both of the photos I am comparing were taken in the 1930's.
  The font research is part of the project. I'd be glad to here anyones advice and
  would be thankful.\r\n\r\nI think this the best one:\r\nRobert Capa: The Definitive
  Collection-\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Robert-Capa-Definitive-Richard-Whelan/dp/0714844497/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b\r\n--\r\nHenri
  Cartier-Bresson: Photographer (Hardcover)-\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Henri-Cartier-Bresson-Aperture-Masters-Photography/dp/0893817449/ref=pd_sim_b_img_4\r\n--\r\nAn
  Inner Silence: The Portraits of Henri Cartier-Bresson (Hardcover)\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Inner-Silence-Portraits-Henri-Cartier-Bresson/dp/0500543178/ref=pd_sim_b_img_3\r\n\r\nmuch
  appreciated.\r\n"
