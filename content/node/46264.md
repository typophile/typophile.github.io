  be only fonts that are openly licensed for such distribution. I suppose the service
  could eventually add in DRM and commercial licensing features if it took off. But
  initially, it's all about just providing a larger palette of type for all web pages
  without requiring any additional coding. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kpao.org/2008/06/wanted-font-family-font-server-plug-in-firefox.html\r\n\r\nThoughts?
  Anyone interested in making it happen?"

    fonts designed to be used on webpages. That's the main thing, and I don't think
    it will make much difference how this repository is accessed by user agents&#8212;as
    long as user agents support @font-face, the font resources could be centralized
    or scattered at numerous locations.\r\n\r\nIt's an appealing idea, but you can
    probably improve web typography faster by spurring Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera
    to make their browsers support @font-face. H\xE5kon Wium Lie, the guy who developed
    CSS and @font-face, works for Opera, so I assume the next version of that user
    agent will support @font-face.\r\n\r\nThe other major factor in all this is support
    from font makers. I've just released a font explicittly licensed for \"embedding\"
    on webpages using the CSS @font-face rule and unlimited distribution on web servers.

    a web service for \u201Copen-licensed\u201D fonts doesn't make sense to me. Why
    should I rely on a service when I can put the font on my server instead? The Google
    hosting of code libraries is a different thing because such libraries change all
    the time and it's a nice service that you could just link to the library and Google
    cares about the updates. But fonts are rarely updated. \r\n\r\n"

    at all for your proposal, why are they such big issues for @font-face?\r\n<strong>A.</strong>
    Because any kind of scheme for using explicit fonts on webpages requires explicit
    calls in one form or another in the CSS, and the type industry doesn't run on
    good will alone, but well-defined EULAs and cash. It has to be practical, and
    if your proposal treats an issue like commercial licensing as a non-issue, it's
    hard to see many people getting behind it.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    Having a central server makes it trivial to ensure commercial fonts are not present.
    If for any reason they do appear, requests (or in the extreme DMCA takedown notices)
    are all that would be needed to rectify the situation. And again, if this turned
    out to be a popular system, it could be extended to include DRMed font files to
    enforce commercial licenses.\r\n\r\nOf course if it gets popular, the costs of
    running the service could become pretty large. Which is why I think Google should

    is practical it will ensure commercial fonts never appear in the central repository.
    Then nobody will need to send cease and desist notices and commercial fonts won't
    have to be removed. A DMCA takedown notice is not extreme. That's kid'stuff in
    the world of intellectual property and commercial rights enforcement. \r\n\r\nHave
    you talked to Google about it yet? Google may say yes, but then you'd have to
    get font makers to donate fonts to the repository. I'm not trying to knock your
    idea into the ground. It has potential, but it needs support from font makers.
    It needs fonts. You already have my support in the form of Pyke's Peak. The question
    is, How many other font makers will donate a font or two from their catalogs?\r\n\r\nj
