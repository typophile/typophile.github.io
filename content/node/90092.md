  was re-branded just before I was hired, and the font chosen for the logotype was
  <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/olsen/bold\">FF Olsen Bold</a>, set with
  tight tracking (it's kerned, naturally, but it's in the -25/-50 zone), with Sentence
  Capitalization.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I'm not sure of the best way to treat
  this typeface as a part of our visual identity, since I've rarely used a chopped
  wedge serif in the past. Do you have any insights into the best uses for this kind
  of face?\r\n\r\nI'm looking for anything from type specimens that you think work
  particularly well for this type to \"always\" or \"never\" rules to general insights.\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions, suggestions, rants, or suggestions welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid Somerville"

    throughout, with a super-tight treatment in the <em>Style</em> section."

  body: "Brilliant! Thank you, Nick!\r\n\r\nHrant, the only reason for the worry is
    that I'm trying to put together a style guide for other designers, based on this
    redesign, and so I need to get my head around what the face is best used for ...
    that way I can encourage designers to use it for the proper purpose, and not try
    and -- say -- set minutia in it when that should be put in a face optimized for
    small display.\r\n\r\nBut you're right, I'm probably over-thinking it. :) Just
    wanting to draw from the collected wisdom of the amazing Typophiles gathered here. "

  body: "I like over-thinking.  :-)\r\n\r\nThat's one cool thing about sheared-wedge
    serifs (or\r\nslanted-slab serifs, depending on how you look at it),\r\nit's hard
    to mess up.\r\n\r\nErnestine for example has been tested down to 4 point and\r\nit's
    shockingly readable (although the large x-height is a\r\nmajor player in this).
    Olsen looks like it would be a solid\r\nperformer as well.\r\n\r\nIn terms of
    character however it's certainly possible\r\nto misuse <em>any</em> font. Olsen
    conveys a no-nonsense\r\nwarmth, a let-me-tell-you-how-it-really-is honesty.\r\nDon't
    use it for wedding invitations.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    just kidding. Ha.\r\n\r\nI like your analysis of Olsen, and wholly agree ... which
    is lovely, because that's exactly the tone I think we'd like to hit. I think I
    can build my recommendations off the personality of the font, actually, now that
    I think about it. Maybe it's better to suggest to designers to, \"Use this font
    for no-nonsense warmth,\" rather than \"only use this for headers.\" That might
    allow more flexibility and interest in the designs.\r\n\r\nThis is great stuff.
    Thank you so much for your input!"
