  body: I take it this is from the side of a dragster? This is the work of a sign
    painter, not a font. You might find something similar if you do a search for "blackletter"
    on <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/blackletter/fonts/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D66%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DTONY%2520NANCY%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D26">MyFonts</a>
    or some other font site.

  body: Its actually from a decal. It is a printed piece. But back then the chance
    that its hand made or modified is pretty high so I'm not to confident to find
    a actual font name.

  body: It could be the printing, but another indication it was done by hand is that
    the three N's and the two Y's are not identical.

    more pass through some font sites and try to find something reasonable. I appreciate
