    the fonts with no kerning pairs. Tell them that they can only use those fonts
    for headlines, and imperfect kerning will lead to a failing grade."

    The big screwup though was having OE and oe in 2 classes :-/ \r\n\r\nI am really
    getting sloppy-brained in recent months!\r\n\r\nI wish There was a good tutorial

    have a little script which checks kern classes for possible overlaps of content,

    classes] and post it tomorrow. Too tired to do it now.\r\n\r\nKarsetn"

    is wrong with class definitions, it shows a report in the Output Panel.\r\n\r\nIf
    you use the AFDKO 2 \"Kern Feature Generator\" script, you only need to define
    tags for leftside, rightside and/or exception classes <i>there</i>. Please see
