  Spiekermann is writing to resonate with the medium team\u2019s piece that self-praises
  how great and inclusive their typography is. He writes\r\n<blockquote>US clients
  often wonder why they need to pay for all those obscure accents. A bit of cultural
  imperialism in play, or plain ignorance, which is not the same, but has the same
  outcome.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot wrong at all. But it got me thinking: do you really
  need to buy a Pro version of a typeface that supports extended Latin, when your
  client has a super limited budget and they\u2019re sure they will only deal with
  English-speaking regions? Big companies like Google will definitely need as much
  language coverage as possible, but \u201Call US clients\u201D seems to be overstating."

    the non-pro version and regret it later, it was their decision.

    accents\".\r\n\r\nObviously, if the type designer is constrained to expend effort
    on covering a wide range of languages using the Latin script with his font, that
    labor needs to be paid for. If this is done by making an extensive range of accents
    the dividing line between the regular and \"Pro\" versions of a font - the way
    that a Xeon or Opteron processor has features that a consumer processor does not,
    and comes at a considerable price premium - then those who don't need them won't
    buy them."

    about, just to make an example, clients\u2019 names?\r\nThat said, I found that
    the first obstacle to a more-than-just-ASCII typography (which includes, other
    than diacritics, proper quotations, etc.) aren\u2019t fonts, but software support
    and input methods. "

  body: Well, common loanwords usually just use the basic European accents found in
    ISO 8869-1, which usually don't cost extra.

  body: "??\r\nThis almost sounds like pricing fonts by the glyph. Does anyone do
    that?\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, language support is the same in all my fonts,
    \"pro\", free or otherwise. It's the OT features and general complexity that increase
    prices. Why would I charge someone who needs some of those \u201Cobscure foreign
    accents\u201D more than I\u2019d charge anyone else? Or put another way, how can
    I expect to sell any fonts in Turkey or Esperantia if I ignore language support?\r\n
    \r\nFrom the client's perspective, it also depends on the application. In two
    recent projects, I commissioned signage versions of two typefaces for my employer.
    I didn't specifically say to the designers, \"Don't include all those obscure
    foreign accents.\" but I did suggest that for at least one of the typefaces that
    the designer could limit language support to Latin 1 - But not because I thought
    I'd save anyone any money. Since our signs will only ever be set in English and
    French, by the time the projects passed all the hurdles of getting approved, the
    time to actually do the work was getting really tight and it seemed like a logical
    place to save a little bit of time \u2013 Although how much time, is a good question.

    that increase prices\" to read \"It's the OT features and general complexity that
    increase costs.\" \r\nIt takes relatively little time to churn out a full set
    of accents using a modern fontmaking program. It is time consuming to design ligatures
    and do correct OT coding. Time is cost.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I retained anything
    from my economics degree of many years ago, it's the concept that the price of
    a font -- like everything else in a free market -- is determined by the intersection
    of supply and demand. What this ends up meaning in the real world is that the
    price at which a font will actually sell bears no direct relationship to cost.
    Some fonts make a profit and others end up being \"a labor of love\" which will
    never pay for the cost of developing them.\r\n\r\nThis applies both to bespoke
    fonts and retail ones.\r\nFor a bespoke font any pricing scheme -- no matter how
    peculiar it may seem to the fontmaker -- works if it is what the client wants.\r\n\r\nLawyers
    can get rich from \"billable hours.\" Any fontmakers who could get this deal would
    be in the lap of luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon"
