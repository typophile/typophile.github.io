  the magazine I work for. We have selected new type faces (Freight & Metroflex from
  Phils Fonts) and my editor has come to me with readability issues (he says it looks
  like the words are running together). I have narrowed it down to H&Js and the spacing
  between the words. I am using Quark 6.5 and need a little bit of guidance in adjusting
  this correctly. \r\n\r\nI know that this process is about trial and error but I
  don't even know where to start. Any help is greatly appreciated. Please feel free
  to contact me via email at erin.potter@charlottemagazine.com or you can reach me
  via telephone at 704.335.7181 x129.\r\n\r\nThanks again in advance.\r\n\r\nErin"

  body: Add word spacing. I am a huge fan of Freight, but its spacebars really are
    too narrow and you aren't the only one to complain about it. I would talk directly
    to Phil's Fonts so they are aware of the problem.

    how do you add word spacing?? Is that a H&J setting?? I'm pretty clueless on this
    specific matter."

    a field for Word Spacing Minimum. Increase that sucker.

  body: "yes, it's quark's way of controlling how many lines of type in a row are
    allowed to end in a hyphenated word. This information interacts with the word
    spacing and letter spacing allowances you set to create your setting. \r\n\r\nKnowing
    how to use the h&j interface is critical to professional typography, and the way
    to learn is through trial and error. Different typefaces require different allowances,
    and type for heads and decks ideally requires different optimums than text type
    if you want to really come up with a well-worked through typographical system
    for your magazine. The graphic designer / art director is the gatekeeper here.
    Even if you don't justify, you need to (re)consider the default optimums.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"
