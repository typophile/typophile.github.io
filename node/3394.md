body: Hello Kids -  <BR> <BR>A few months ago I discovered ambigrams, and soon after
  that fell in love with the magic that are symbiotograms. I was asked to design a
  skateboard graphic, and finally! I had a good chance to apply a symbiotogram to
  a commercial project. The ambidextrous nature of a board leant itself perfectly
  to such a design, and under the theme of anti-violence, I designed the below graphic.

  <BR> <BR>It can be a little tricky to read on one rotation, but I think it just
  about works. I&#39;m interested to hear what you think and whether you&#39;ve played
  around with similar things.

  body: Very clever. I think it works.  <BR> <BR>I took the F to be an S when I first
    looked at it, which sort of changes the meaning. But I think that may have been
    because the bottom of the F was cut off by the browser window at first, so I&#39;m
    not sure if it&#39;s necessarilly something to worry about.

  body: There is a thread here somewhere on the subject... <BR> <BR>Good stuff! I
    like it. This is kind of an esoteric question, but what sort of printing process
    were you thinking of using?

  body: 'Good work. I would shorten the first L just a little to tighten up the I-N
    gap. I haven&#39;t heard the term &#34;symbiotogram&#34; before, but I assume
    it means an ambigram that reads differently each way. <BR> <BR>My ambigrams are

  body: Thanks guys.  <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right Keven - that L does need shortening
    up a bit. Your ambigram gallery is very impressive. I particularly enjoyed &#39;zonathrope&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>John &#62; The design was going to silk-screened in silver metallic on
    a black board. Why do you ask?

    <BR> <BR>Maybe curve back the stem on the second &#39;L&#39; to form the leg of
    the &#39;K&#39;, might work. <BR> <BR>My example isn&#39;t too good, mostly because
    I&#39;m supposed to be working right now... <BR> <BR>The silver on a black deck
    wil be killer!

    You seem to do a lot of stencils... I&#39;m really interested in stencils right
    now. P.S. I love the simplicity of your site!
