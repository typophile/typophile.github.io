body: After following the Cyrillic Small Caps thread below, I got <BR>to wondering
  about OT support between applications. <BR>For instance, Illustrator CS supports
  Stylistic Alternates  <BR>while InDesign CS doesn&#39;t. &#40;they can be manually
  added <BR>via the glyph pallete but it tends to be clunky compared <BR>to the ease
  with which Illustrator CS can do it&#41; <BR> <BR>Any thoughts? <BR>

    it did.

  body: Different groups with Adobe are responsible for defining the feature set of
    their apps. The &#60;salt&#62; feature is something of a peculiarity as it may
    be implemented with GSUB type 1 lookups &#40;one-to-one&#41; or type 3 lookups
    &#40;one-to-one-of-many&#41;. Apparently the InDesign team decided not to support
    the feature at all until they are able to support the type 3 lookup, while the
    Illustrator team decided to provide support by treating the first enumerated glyph
    of a type 3 lookup as if it were a type 1 lookup. So Illustrator provides partial
    support for the &#60;salt&#62; feature &#40;so, by the way, does InDesign Middle
    East&#41;.

  body: After buying the new CS package I have to say I was <BR>a little surprised
    by the way each program supports OT. <BR> <BR>From a type designers standpoint
    the &#60;salt&#62; feature is <BR>very helpful. Alternate letters are actually
    not that  <BR>uncommon so why not put them all into in a single file? <BR>Old
    news of course, but what is the best way to do it <BR>without leaving InDesign
    users out of the picture?
