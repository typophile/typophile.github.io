body: "Hello all, \r\n\r\nI have designed three fonts recently in FontLab, a family
  of reg/ita (A-B), plus one other font (C). \r\n\r\nWhen I generate OT fonts and
  install on my Mac via Fontbook, all is normal, but on my laptop, fontbook gives
  me a warning that the fonts are corrupt and may crash the system. I have ignored
  it and installed, and the fonts work normally. \r\n\r\nWhen I mailed the fonts to
  my laptop instead of transferring on a USB keyring, there was no warning. \r\n\r\nI
  then mailed the fonts to two friends. One, using Fontbook, installed the A-B font
  without any problems but got a crash warning on the C font. The other friend, using
  Suitcase, installed the C font painlessly whereas the A-B font did not show up at
  all in Suitcase.\r\n\r\nIn short, problems seem to occur randomly. Can anybody help?\r\n\r\nRegards,
  Per J\xF8rgensen\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Grrrben, that might help me. Only, I do not know what a UFO is (in
    a type context), I can't find it in FL. How do I export to a UFO?

  body: "UFO is an open font format for interchanging font data between different
    font tools. You need to install RoboFab to use it. Among other things, it adds
    Python scripts to FontLab that allow it to read and write to the UFO format.\r\n\r\nYou
    can get it here: http://robofab.org/"
