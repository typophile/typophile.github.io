    other characters.\r\n\r\nJorge, how did you get your image to load directly into
    the thread instead of as a link?"

    in publishing and believe it or not many of my clients are still in 9) but I have
    X/Safari too so will play around with this.\r\n\r\nNow if only they can reduce
    the font size in the original post I'll die happy (I know I'm a broken record
    on this, but when it's more than a few lines it gets so horsey, as in the FAQ.)"

  body: Believe me, I know and love OS X. I'm planning to upgrade my other machine
    by the end of the year, the hell with my clients. I don't like being between two
    systems. It just happens that the one I mostly use for the internet is the OS
    9 machine. Although I sometimes end up using both at the same time. Can't get
    enough!

    link just a few seconds before upload the sample!!!!\r\n\r\nPatty, I supose you
    don't need no further informations: the gang helped you first!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the original question is not completly answered. Crass is similar but not solid,
    and Glaser isn't an exact match...\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nJorge
