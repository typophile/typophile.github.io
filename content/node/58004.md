  body: "@Michael: Well, one could always argue that LG is just a lubalinized Memphis!
    :-)\r\n\r\n@Pedro: Have a look into the Wiki: [[Books]]. Also: the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/books\">Typophiles\u2019
    Library</a>. \r\n\r\nI assume there\u2019s no doubt that the <a href=\"http://www.fontbook.com/\">FontBook</a>
    is the most complete and up-to-date ressource for printed type specimen. If you
    are more after selected quality than quantity, then there are several good options,
    depending on what exactly you are looking for. \r\n\r\nFor digitally available
    font families, check out <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Schriftwechsel_%28Buch%29\">Schriftwechsel
    by Stephanie & Ralf de Jong</a>. 250 \u2018favourite\u2019 typefaces are presented
    and compared to each other. Fontblog has a <a href=\"http://www.fontblog.de/geeignete-fonts-das-buch-zur-orientierung-ist-da\">few
    images</a>. Unfortunately, this recent release is available in German only.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Wegweiser_Schrift_%28Buch%29\">Wegweiser
    Schrift</a> by [[Hans Peter Willberg]] is another recommendable reference book:
    far less voluminous and rather directed at beginners, but also a lot more affordable.
    Also, only available in German, sorry."
