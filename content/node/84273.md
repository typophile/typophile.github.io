  body: 'It''s not a choice. If the convention of the document is that a break between
    two paragraphs is indicated by indenting, then that is what you do, regardless
    of what is adjacent to the text. Paragraphs are textual elements, and visually
    distinguishing them is an aid to the reader. Consider: if the last line of the
    previous paragraph happened to exactly or nearly extend to the right margin, removing
    the indent in this situation would remove all indication that these are two separate
    paragraphs. Basic rule: having established a document level convention for distinguishing
    textual elements, don''t break that convention.'

  body: I think Riccardo is saying that defining the paragraph separation convention
    for a particular document is a choice. But yes, you've set a style, stick with
    it.

  body: "It doesn't look weird to me, either.\r\n\r\nBut if it bothers you, you might
    try moving the photo to the right so the runaround occurs on the right side of
    the type column rather than the left side.  That way the left edge alignment won't
    be interrupted by the runaround."
