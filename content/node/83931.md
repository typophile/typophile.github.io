  that communicate quite this request.\r\n\r\nI am in search of a rounded sans-serif
  that has equal widths. I need the font to communicate professional yet fun. The
  tick with this style of font is that it can easily become cheesy feeling. \r\n\r\nAny
  help or suggestions on where to start looking would be much appreciated. "
