  regarding my logo that I have been working on.\r\n\r\nAs it goes I happen to have
  double AA as my initials, been struggling with ideas and sketches for a while, this
  is one of the more solid ideas that I came up with.\r\n\r\n(Note I have not selected
  or really thought about the font yet.)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the idea comes
  through easy enough.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Clever idea. You will need some polish. Regarding just composition, I think
    the best one is the one below the one with the red.\r\nI think what's working
    here is the alignment between As' crossbars and E.\r\nYou should pay special attention
    to the evennes of strokes' weights and whitespaces.\r\nAlso you could extend to
    the entire word \"DESIGN\" some kind of different upper/lower treatment."

  body: "Thank you riccard0!\r\n\r\nYes I do need to polish this project a bit, I
    really need to start looking at fonts that would go with my \"D\" design. Any
    suggestions from the community? I would really appreciate it :)\r\n\r\nI do agree
    riccard0 that weight works better than the other ones, the weight of the stroke
    is a bit more than half of the outer shapes. Here are a few minor tweaks and variations,
    sorry if not too much variation :/ work ate up most of my mental stamina today.\r\n\r\nThank
    you all in advance!\r\n\r\nPS: mental cookies to people with comments and suggestions

  body: "What would happen if you took this last version. mirrored the top 'A' vertically
    and rotated the bottom \"A\" 90 degrees counter-clockwise - lined them up to make
    a 'northern' hemisphere?\r\n\r\nI feel like the large \"D\" form is too heavy-handed,
    and the mark itself is difficult to balance. It's a testament to your skill as
    a designer if you can portray it without explicitly stating so..."

  body: "Hi brockfrench thank you for the reply.\r\n\r\nI can certainly see what you
    mean by the large 'D' being a bit heavy handed, the reason I ended up with such
    an idea was because everything else I came up with looked like a 'cool' or weird
    shape without an idea behind it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AA_iDea6_6236.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/AA_iDea7_3829.png]\r\n\r\nRegarding
    your suggestion, did you mean after the changes made the sphere shaped double
    'A' sit alone as my monogram or be incorporated into the word design?\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone else could make suggestions or give their thoughts I would really appreciate
    it.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "I have a bias towards thick lines and forms. I think the 3rd in the post
    above is working nicely, because you're using one form in two ways. You can read
    into this however you like, but to me, it's about design economy & flexibility.\r\n\r\nI
    think the mark should sit alone when presented to people who know you're a designer.\r\n\r\nYou
    could also produce a version of that mark with your name / trade <strong>modestly</strong>
    set below it - for when people need to know your name.\r\n\r\nArbi Ayvazian or
    Ayvazian Design\r\n\r\n(Though it looks like you'll need to use something slim
    and condensed. :)\r\n\r\nIn all instances where you've included the full word
    \"design\" into the mark, it looks amateur, and it is literally drowning the monogram.
    The mark is about you, not about the word \"design\"."

  body: "Ah yes! I see what you mean now, thank you for the clarification brockfrench.
    Interesting, I was kinda looking at it from the other way, but I know what you
    mean. It does throw a cheap shoe into the pile so to speak.\r\n\r\nWell its back
    to the drawing board for a while, the main issue is using the same shape 'A' without
    making one of the letters look like another letter.\r\n\r\nI need to dig up some
    of my sketches and go from there!\r\n\r\nOh and mental cookies for you brockfrench
    and riccard0 and many thanks again for your input.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "Ha! Dip your head in milk that will solve the problem. :P\r\n\r\nYup that
    is what what I gathered as well, the mark will look different yet only incorporate
    my name as the main subject. I will try a few different variations and show the
    results later.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you so much brockfrench, always nice to get
    a different perspective on a problem. Feel free to ask me for any illustration
    help if you ever need it."
