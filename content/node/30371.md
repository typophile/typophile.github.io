  body: "I recently purchased Andrade Pro and I love it. This looks awesome also.
    With complete families at around $100-$200, they're great values for unique typefaces.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Dino!"

  body: "The 50% off deal at Myfonts is the kicker. I had to buy Leitura Sans, because
    it is awesome! I've been looking for a great humanistic sans to complement my
    collection of classic serifs, and the lower case \"a\" really does it for me in
    this series.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leitura_3947.jpg]"
