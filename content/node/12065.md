  yet? This cannot be; Typophiles don't strike me as a group that would shy away from
  new features! I have a hunch that the personal Typophile blogs (someone is going
  to have to create a cool acronym or cool name for these things) might turn out to
  be the best new feature on this site.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI haven't taken to blogging
  yet, but I love the idea. In fact, I love the idea so much that a few weeks ago,
  I began to try and build my own blog into the <a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de\">TypeOff</a>
  site (it isn't finished yet). Wouldn't you know, as soon as I got cracking with
  the code, I read that the new Typophile redesign would include personal blogs. No
  homemade blog could be as cool as a Typophile one; however, I still hope to launch
  the TypeOff-blog by the end of the month.\r\n\r\nThe new Typophile seems very visually
  sophisticated. In fact, it looks so visually sophisticated that I can't believe
  that I am actually looking at it! I haven't seen all of the new site yet, but the
  new look and the new features (like this, and the wiki) look so nice that the old
  comments and discussions\u2014ported in total over to this new system, it seems\u2014feel
  a bit lost amidst all of this luster. Kudos to Jared, Joe, Yves, Christian, and
  whoever else helped out, though. Typophile is the most important typographic site
  on the internet (IMHO), the discussions are what always gave it its charm, and I'm
  sure that they will continue to do so. Wow. This all rocks! Even the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/7003\">Ghost
  of Steuf</a> page."
