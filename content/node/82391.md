  Excoffon: a name that means little to the man in the street. And yet\u2026 If this
  man in the street were born in France between 1930 and today, he would doubtless
  have been exposed to one of his creations. A talented typeface designer (Mistral,
  Banco, Choc and Antique Olive all bear his signature) and adman (he designed hundreds
  of posters and logos, such as for Air France), Roger Excoffon is likely among those
  whose splendid work accompanies our every step, emphatically inhabiting the collective
  unconscious. His alphabets were whole, alive with uncommon personality and vigor;
  they were highly prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s, gracing many caf\xE9s, hair salons
  and bakeries, adorned with a flavor and connotations that in fact would engender
  a disinterest in following years; willingly obsolescent, profoundly French, esthetically
  dazzling, they are integral to our history and culture.\r\n\r\nThis bilingual French
  and English monograph by David Rault (graphic designer and journalist, director
  of the Atelier Perrousseaux collection, member of Atypi, and author of Guide pratique
  de choix typographique) deals with the type designer as well as the adman, with
  the man as well as the artist, and features: a biography based on an unpublished
  interview Roger Excoffon gave to Fran\xE7ois Richaudeau in 1977; an important iconography
  (including rare photographs by Jean Dieuzaide and never before published paintings
  from private collections); and exceptional contributions by Massin, Peter Knapp,
  Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida, Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez, Fran\xE7ois Richaudeau, Yves
  Perrousseaux and Hrant Papazian.\r\n\r\n240 pages, color, 21x29,7cm."
