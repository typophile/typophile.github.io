body: "Hello Typophiles! It's been a while since I lurked these corridors, but I have
  a slight query at work and would like to ask your opinions if I may.\r\n\r\nBeen
  given a re-branding project at work, its nothing enormous, but it revolves around
  fashion and extreme sports. We are building a new website, product photography,
  the whole shebang.\r\n\r\nTo cut the long story short, the owners want the brand
  to be different, but not too different. The brand 'Typeface' being a horrid font
  by the name of 'Aggie'. Anyway. It has to go.\r\n\r\nSo I need rid of Aggie, and
  the replacement needs to resemble it in some fashion but drag it out of 2002. If
  that is at all possible.\r\n\r\nI found two potentials, one called Korataki, which
  serves nicely despite the terrible caps 'K' that resembles a decapitated stick man.
  Its an improvement at least.\r\n\r\nThen I found 'Sone' which is really fresh, plenty
  of weights, Could be used as body type also, but, alas, not the most imposing or
  effective when it comes to Logo type. \r\n\r\nThing is, that remains to be seen
  as need to decide what to purchase, I don't want to flex company plastic at both
  only to find neither efficient or effective. \r\n\r\nI thought one of you might
  be able to pluck a solution out of obscurity, would love to know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks!
  Tom.  \r\n"

    fairly priced for the amount of weights and alternate characters you get and looks
    like a good fit for the aesthetic you're going for (based on the other fonts you're
    looking at).\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>penn</em>"

    matching logo or commission an extra weight that hits that really punchy spot
    you\u2019re looking for?"
