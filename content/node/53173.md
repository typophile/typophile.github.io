  Egyptian I found in an old book. It's not complete yet - still a few glyphs missing
  - but I think it's finally getting there.\r\n\r\nI've been staring at it so much
  in the last couple of weeks that I'm loosing my objectivity.\r\n\r\nThe first PDF
  shows what I have so far. The other two are examples of the font in use.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.terremoto.ca/Font/Spurred%20Block%20Standard.pdf]]\r\n[[http://www.terremoto.ca/Font/Gunpowder%20Can.pdf]]\r\n[[http://www.terremoto.ca/Font/Map%20of%20the%20Universe.pdf]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any feedback.\r\n\r\nDan"

    to create them nowadays.

    now though - building a font is a project-and-a-half that keeps me off the streets.\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "Bowl of P/R could stand to be bigger.\r\n\r\nThe A (all variants) seems a
    little narrow and unbalanced at the apex; I would pull the top-right nodes to
    the right a bit so that the right stroke has a more consistent slope and weight.\r\n\r\nThis
    may be more a matter of taste, but I'm not sure the sports-swash crossbars really
    go with the style."
