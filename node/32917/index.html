<p>Uniscribe and Devanagari (or any complex script): the glyph substitutions are not supported by InDesign.</p>
<p>Has anyone written or heard of any conversion tool, that will analyze Uniscribe text (that is, text written in a complex script like Devanagari) and make all substitutions permanent (that is, the actual glyphs, rather than lookups for substitution, will be written), thus making the font useable in InDesign? So it would be a workaround for Indesign and Uniscribe. . .</p>
<p>Thanks.

<p>I am not a programmer, so I can&rsquo;t judge how difficult it would be to do what I was imagining. But I still hope that someone who is a programmer might have the interest and the genius to write some kind of code (be it a plug-in or anything else) that can make Uniscribe and InDesign become more friendly. Waiting for Adobe might be like waiting for Godot!</p>
<p>Why, actually, hasn&rsquo;t Adobe incorporated Uniscribe into InDesign? I hesitate to impute to Adobe the kind of sinister racist motives that another commenter has suggested. I imagine it would be one of two possible reasons: (i) it is actually very difficult to incorporate Uniscribe into InDesign, because the features of the one somehow conflict with the features of the other; or (ii) It is not economically viable: why spend money to develop a feature that will be used primarily by people who will not pay for it? (That is, at least in India, as I understand it, the vast majority of Adobe software users do not have licensed software: they buy it on the street corner or download it from pirate sites. (An aside: when we needed two licenses for InDesign, we put in an order with a software supplier in Kolkata, and waited over two months before we received the disks. Adobe doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to go legal in India!))</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The OpenType specifications were released ten years ago in April 1997.</p>
<p>This is not an April Fool joke. This is a fact.</p>
<p>The OpenType font format was devised to support non-Latin scripts, especially the so-called &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Merrian-Webster&rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition, defines &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; as &ldquo;a member of a socially disadvantaged class of persons&rdquo;. Ten years ago, &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; in Africa, India etc. were disadvantaged such that none of them was permitted to use any of their own scripts (Devanagari etc.) under Windows.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Microsoft implemented the OT support for &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo; in Africa, India etc. as an integral component of all versions of Windows published since that time. Since many years, even the most elementary Windows programs (e.g. the simple one line editor &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;) and also all freeware word processors (e.g. Open Office Writer) can handle &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As opposed to this, for the past ten years, Adobe has been intentionally preventing &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; from using &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo;. Although the OT support for &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo; is an integral component of Windows readily available to all application programs, Adobe wilfully blocked this Windows OT component so that &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; in Africa, India etc. cannot use their own &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Considering that even the simplest one-line editor written by a hobby programmer permits &ldquo;[edited by moderator]s&rdquo; to use &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo;, there is no other explanation than that Adobe deliberatey prevents &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; from using &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo; for reasons of racism and apartheid.</p>

<p>Oh, good point. So there&rsquo;s a third possible reason. Is there any support for Indic scripts, similar to Uniscribe, on the Mac?</p>
<p>If the two systems are incompatible, then the only hope for advanced script support in InDesign would be through a plug-in, I suppose.</p>

<p>Since Uniscribe is an integral component of all newer Windows versions (Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista), even young school kids writing simple programs can easily display all Indic scripts. This means, that Adobe programmers, who are assumed to have more programming experience than young school kids would have no difficulty to display &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo; in Adobe programs, if the Adobe outfit were willing to permit &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; to use the &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo; of their own mother tongues.</p>
<p>Typophilers do not care that &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; in Africa, India etc. cannot use their own &ldquo;[edited by moderator] scripts&rdquo;. For instance, if Typophilers see this picture</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/%5Bedited">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/[edited</a> by moderator].jpg</p>
<p>the only thing they care about is to know the name of the typeface which was used for typesetting the headline. But Typophilers do not care that, for instance in India alone, there are more than one billion (1,000,000,000) speakers who want to use fonts for the scripts of their own mother tongues.</p>
<p>But Adobe deliberately prevents &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; from using their mother tongue scripts.</p>
<p>So, &ldquo;[edited by moderator]&rdquo; who want to use InDesign will have to renounce their mother tongue.</p>

This means, among other things, that Adobe&rsquo;s support for complex scripts has lagged behind that of Microsoft for the simple reason that Adobe&rsquo;s historical internationalisation pushes have not been as global as Microsoft&rsquo;s and they have concentrated on the East Asian market.</p>
<p>As the developer of the Adobe Arabic, Adobe Hebrew and Adobe Thai fonts, though, I&rsquo;m pretty confident about Adobe&rsquo;s long-term commitment to complex script support, even if I wish it were happening faster.</p>

<p>Swami Mahayogananda:</p>
<p>If Windows application programs do not intentionally block or disable the built-in Windows Uniscribe font renderer for complex scripts, then these programs will automatically render Indic scripts.</p>
<p>For instance, if you look at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/fonttest.htm">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/fonttest.htm</a></p>
<p>you will see this</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/fonttest.gif">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/fonttest.gif</a></p>
<p><strong>if and only if</strong> you use a Windows browser that <strong>does not</strong> intentionally block or disable the Uniscribe renderer.</p>
<p>However, since all Adobe application programs (InDesign etc. etc.) intentionally blocked or disabled the built-in Windows Uniscribe font renderer for Indic scripts, it is not possible to write &ldquo;a little something&rdquo;, because Adobe intentionally prevents Indians from using Indian scripts.</p>
<p>I hope that you now get it that Adobe does not want you to use Indic scripts in InDesign, otherwise it would not willfully block the Uniscribe functions.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;a seamless cross-platform experience for users&rdquo; described by Mr. Hudson means that Indian users have a &ldquo;seamless cross-platform non-experience&rdquo;, because Adobe intentionally blocked or disabled both Microsoft&rsquo;s Uniscribe as well as Apple&rsquo;s own Macintosh Indic font renderer.</p>

<p>Adobe is certainly interested in better international language support, and it&rsquo;s an area we know we need to improve dramatically.</p>

<p>Adobe apps neither &lsquo;block&rsquo; nor &lsquo;disable&rsquo; either Windows or Mac Indic script processing, they simply don&rsquo;t use it (and they are not alone in this). Uniscribe is a set of APIs for processing Unicode text, and applications have to deliberately make use of it, either directly or via a higher level set of APIs; it is not something that one blocks or allows, it is something one deliberately takes advantage of or chooses not to. And there are good reasons why developers might choose to &lsquo;roll  their own&rsquo;, as Adobe have done, rather than making their application dependent on OS services that are outside of their control. One of the key reasons is, as I wrote, cross-platform compatibility. Yes, Windows and Mac both offer Indic text processing via system services, but they do so in incompatible ways using competing font layout formats. Adobe have a decade-old commitment to cross platform compatibility in their design apps, and that means waiting for them to assign resources to supporting language and script handling for specific markets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the first person to say that I wish Adobe apps supported Devanagari and other Indian scripts, and also that we&rsquo;ve been waiting much too long for this. I know Adobe have the know-how to implement this stuff, because I&rsquo;ve worked with some of the people who would be responsible. It&rsquo;s a question of managers releasing budget funds to get the work done and getting it into the product cycle.</p>
<p>Misrepresenting what Adobe have done and their reasons for doing it is not going to make Indic support in Adobe apps happen any sooner.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Instead of blaming or fighting with Adobe, I like to submit my humble proposal to make enable Indic processing in InDesign as follow:</p>
<p>Adobe InDesign CS3 supports Unicode, XML, XMP, HTML and all web compatible tech, but Indic (Hindi-Devanagari, Oriya, Gujarati etc.) not supported because these are very complex due to some illogical positioning of Maatraas and conjuncts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>(1) 
Input is 
क+ि =</p>
<p>But Output is needed/optained as
कि</p>
<p>i.e. shifting of character inputed afterwards, but to appear before it.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Input is</p>
<p>क+ा+र+्+य+ो+ं</p>
<p>But output of which is</p>
<p>कार्यों</p>
<p>i.e. shifting of third+fourth character-code to seventh+eighth in sequence.</p>
<p>For obtaining this rendering only OT font&rsquo;s glyph substitution/possitioning rules can not solve the problem. This illogical and complex positioning has to be obtained by the special technic inbuilt in the Rendering Engines of Operating System. (In case of Windows : Unicows.dll and USP10.dll etc. i.e. Uniscribe or Unicode Script Processor)</p>
<p>Whereas the scope of a PageLayout program like Adobe InDesign should remain limited upto the OT Fonts (i.e. glyphs). Even if in Edit mode the text is rendered in traditional/desired form with the help of rendering engine of Operating system, but when the layout output in Unicode will be sent to the printer(Postscript, or color separation processing units), the repossitioned glyphs gets distorted, because there the rendering engine does not work or save the balance between sequences of Encoded characters and repositioned sequences of glyphs of OT fonts.</p>
<p>More, the output not necessirialy to be get with that particualr OS (like Windows) only, user should have freedom to get it with any OS. Or the layout-output must be OS independent.</p>
<p>I think this is the policy of Adobe, the great IT gaint must finding some OS independent tech. for their products like InDesign.</p>
<p>So I propose a solve, atleast may be for presently/temporarily, as :</p>
<p>(1) 
For Print media 
In Hindi (or other Indic) in Unicoded OT fonts:</p>
<p>&ndash; 1st Compose with Layout in Unicoded OT fonts (with Rendering Engine help)
&ndash; Then make a PDF of the pages with option of &ldquo;inlcude OT fonts&rdquo; 
(As PDF uses only sequence-wise glyphs of a OT font, does not use the Unicode character code sequences, as there is no need to futher processing) 
&ndash; Then send the PDF for print or pre-print processing.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Design/Develop Hindi (or other Indic) OT Fonts with all the complete syllables(अक्षरों), not with mere/limited characters (वर्ण) and glyphs(वर्णों के टुकड़ों या संयुक्ताक्षरों). The possible number of complete syllables in Hindi still could not be counted yet. It may go beyond Billions.</p>
<p>For example in Devanagari (Sanskrit) in the word</p>
<p>कार्त्स्न्या</p>
<p>का is one syllable
and
र्त्स्न्या is second syllable</p>
<p>र्+त्+स्+न्+य+ा</p>
<p>Here 10 number of Unicode characters combindingly makes one syllable (अक्षर).</p>
<p>There should not be any such thinking or arguments that &ldquo;this or that Conjunct/syllable is never used&rdquo;. If one has to write name of all the persons all over the world in Devanaagarii, all combinations of C+C+C+C+C(n)&hellip;+V/M+VM should be taken in account in syllable designing. [C=consonant, V=Vowel, M=Maatraa, VM=Vowel Modifier].</p>
<p>For this in Devanaagari</p>
<p>if Base Consonants = 34 Numbers
Base Vowels = 16
Base Maatraa = 16
Vowel Modifiers = 3
Nukta = 1</p>
<p>Then at 1 level of consonant, total number of syllables may be 34+16=50<em>16=800</em>3=2400</p>
<p>क का कि की कु कू&hellip;.. को कौ 
कं कां किं कीं कुं कूं&hellip;.. कों कौं 
कँ काँ किँ कीँ कुँ कूँ &hellip;.. कोँ कोँ
कः काः किः कीः कुः कूः&hellip; कोः कौः
&hellip;.
&hellip;.
ह हा हि&hellip;
हः हाः हिः</p>
<p>क्कि क्कु क्कौ, क्कौँ
स्मि र्क्रोँ&hellip; ल्क्य (याज्ञवल्क्य)</p>
<p>At 2 level of consonant conjuncts 2400<strong>2
At 5 level of consonant conjuncts 2400</strong>5</p>
<p>At 10 level of consonant conjuncts 2400**10 = 6.3403380965376e+33</p>
<p>Which comes to infinite, or we may say total number of syllables in Devanaagari (or in other Indic script may be as much as total number of stars in the sky or hairs in a human body)</p>
<p>N.B. : Above calcutaion may be wrong, it should be taken just a mere example/glympsh.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>So the Indic users should</p>
<p>Either make a Hindi OT font with all the syllables(अक्षर)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Remain satisfied by just using the glyphs (pieces of characters) only, forget further processing, searching, replacing, sorting and indexing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’m not an expert, but I understand InDesign’s situation like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adobe wanted to have it truly cross-platform, and because Microsoft’s and Apple’s implementations &ndash; Uniscribe and ATSUI/Core Text &ndash; are different, Adobe had to create a third one for itself. 
Also, they can’t use the AAT font technology that Apple used or uses for its Indic script support.</li>
<li>Because InDesign has very sophisticated typographic possibilities, it’s much more difficult to integrate Indic-script support in it than in a simple text editor. Although I guess that, if they had planned it for complex scripts from the start, things would have been easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps to clear the air&hellip;</p>
<p>For the time being, a way of using InDesign for Indic scripts is to use non-Unicode fonts. There is FontSuvidha for converting Unicode Devanagari to many other encodings; I don’t know if there are similar programs for the other scripts.</p>

<p>I took care that <strong>all</strong> approx. 1000 ligatures (अक्षर) were allocated PUA (private use area) code points in the hexadecimal E000+ range so that our font, which is unique in this regard, can, at least theoretically, also be used with Adobe programs which cannot handle Indic Unicode font rendering. However this roundabout makeshift of entering PUA codes by character palette can only be recommended for a few words typeset in Devanagari, not for longer texts. For complete texts, you must use a professional Windows program such as MS Word, not InDesign.</p>

Over the years, he has worked so hard on enabling proper Indic script typesetting, struggling with all the intricacies presented by the various font technologies and operating systems, that I can understand how the creators of so many obstacles to his goal have started to appear like enemies to him.
Also, the word you edited out was not meant in an abusive, but in a defensive sense, as you had surely noticed, and could have been replaced by something like &ldquo;underdeveloped&rdquo;. In Europe, by the way, this word (or what I think it was) is not as shocking as it is in the US.</p>
<p>That said, I was intrigued by the earlier post about Thai script. Does InDesign handle this script completely, or does it leave it to Uniscribe’s grace when the text is marked as &ldquo;no language&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I believe the support for Thai is entirely internal to InDesign; it does not rely on Uniscribe. We originally developed the Adobe Thai fonts for Acrobat forms, and in that context I believe support was, at least initially, via Uniscribe. But as I understand it the InDesign CS3 developers then added support for Thai internally.</p>
<p>Thai is relatively easy for Adobe to implement within their existing layout architecture, because there is only on instance in which a single character (sara am) needs to be represented by more than one glyph, and this can be handled as a buffered character substitution since the two parts are also independent characters (sara aa, nikhahit).* So Thai does not require any one-to-many glyph substitutions, which are the big stumbling block for Adobe.</p>
<p>*Uniscribe also handles this as a buffered character substitution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little stuck and you guys seem to know what you are talking about!</p>
<p>I am doing some work for a Museum in Thailand and need to incorporate Thai text (supplied by the client), into some graphics produced in InDesign CS2 (running on OS 10.4) - so I don&rsquo;t need to write it, just work with the text my client sends me.</p>
<p>I am using the Thai fonts that came with OS10.4 English version. The problem is that the character spacing gets distorted. Accents are slightly off and all over the place, rather than sitting above characters, they are slightly off and in some instances take up about a character space to themselves. The overall effect is funny breaks between characters.</p>
<p>Does CS3 handle this better? Is there an international version of Indesign that I could get to overcome this?</p>
<p>Any help is gratefully received.</p>

It is my understanding that you cannot do this in CS2, be it on a Mac or on a PC. The international versions of InDesign have been CE and ME – these handled the accents of Central and Eastern European languages, as well as the Right to Left nature of certain Middle Eastern scripts like Hebrew and Arabic. There isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;InDesign South Asia&rdquo; or anything like that… but if the hints I heard were correct, you&rsquo;d be just fine with your Thai texts as long as you upgrade!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jenny, there are two issues here: one is that CS2 does not support Thai layout at all, and the other is that the Mac OS X Thai fonts are probably AAT format rather than OpenType, i.e. they use Apple&rsquo;s own layout intelligence model rather than OpenType&rsquo;s, which means that they will also not work in CS3 or anywhere else in Adobe apps.</p>
<p>So if you want to use those particular fonts then you will need to set the text in a Mac app that uses AAT layout. What you might be able to do is to set individual blocks of text in such an app, export or print them to PDF, and then embed the PDFs in your InDesign app as graphics. This is what I do when I need to include text in InDesign documents using scripts or font formats that are not supported by Adobe.</p>
<p>Another option, if you don&rsquo;t mind updating your software and switching fonts, would be to install InDesign CS3 and use some OpenType Thai fonts. The Adobe Thai font family ships with Acrobat 7.0.5 and later (look in the Acrobat/Fonts folder) and is good for text. Linotype have just launched OpenType versions of their classic Sukothai and Sirichana typefaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As the engineer on InDesign who added improvements for Thai in CS3, I want to be as clear &amp; honest as I can. We took some steps towards Thai support in InDesign, but we do not claim to have reached our minimal level of support (yet). The same is true for other scripts.  For Thai, there is [[http://www.indesignthai.com/board/|InDesign Thai]] which I have heard of, but haven&rsquo;t evaluated.
Anyway, for Thai:</p>
<ol>
<li>We do not use AAT or Uniscribe. In fact, we only do the correct positioning of marks using OpenType fonts that do the positioning themselves using &lsquo;mark&rsquo; and &lsquo;mkmk&rsquo; features. Microsoft&rsquo;s original Thai fonts had a table-based way of doing mark positioning using some PUA accent glyphs, but we don&rsquo;t support it. I think InDesign ME and InDesign Thai both support the Microsoft legacy fonts, but not AAT fonts.  (not sure)</li>
<li>In CS3 we did not utilize any code to break Thai phrases correctly. The user would have to insert &ldquo;discretionary line break characters&rdquo; manually (U+200B: zero width breaking space). FYI, Thai doesn&rsquo;t use spaces between words, but still expects line-breaks to occur between words. There are free algorithmic approaches available which we are investigating.</li>
</ol>
<p>The InDesign team believes that extending our script support is a good long-term business opportunity, but as pointed out above we have to implement a cross-platform solution and (more critically) we are unwilling to release something under the &ldquo;Adobe InDesign&rdquo; label unless it reaches a pretty high level of quality. And, of course these features compete for resources with every other wish-list&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the responses - what a relief to know that i&rsquo;m not alone!</p>
<p>It appears to be possible to upgrade to CS3 and get hold of some OpenType Thai fonts, although this is not guaranteed to work. Plus there may be some manual tweaking required, which I would not be confident in doing not being a Thai speaker. I could always download a trial of CS3 to try it but it looks like the choice of font is key to the correct alignment of accents. Linotype was mentioned earlier - can I assume that any one of these should work?</p>
<p>A silly question - but how do our Thai friends get around it? Is it that the whole system from hardware to operating system - is set up for it?</p>
<p>With thanks</p>

<p>I have the Linotype Sukothai and Sirichana OpenType fonts, and can confirm that they work in InDesign CS3 (with Eric&rsquo;s caveats about linebreaking). I can also confirm that the &lsquo;Adobe Thai&rsquo; fonts work &ndash; I know this because I made them. :)</p>
<p>I have put a PDF of samples of the fonts, set in InDesign CS3, online at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiro.com/John/ThaiCS3samples.pdf">http://www.tiro.com/John/ThaiCS3samples.pdf</a></p>
<p>The linebreaking issue is a tricky one, and you would need a qualified native proofreader.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, you could set the text in Word, using the same text block size as in your target InDesign document, make use of Word&rsquo;s Thai dictionaries for linebreaking, and then you could insert hard linebreaks at the end of every line, and copy/paste the text into InDesign, preserving the Word linebreaks.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps tidier on the InDesign end, you could paste in the text without hard linebreaks from Word, and then use the (printed) Word setting as a guide for where to place discretionary linebreaks (shift+enter/return) in InDesign. This would produce correct linebreaks but wouldn&rsquo;t treat every line as a separate paragraph.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">We call the shift+enter a &ldquo;soft return&rdquo; because it forces a line break without forming a new paragraph.  The discretionary break is an optional break that doesn&rsquo;t insert a hyphen or anything. We don&rsquo;t assign it a keyboard shortcut, but one could.  Numerically, the soft return is U+000A, paragraph break is U+000D, and discretionary break is U+200B.</div>

There&rsquo;s also another cheaper plugin for CS3 which does Thai line breaks but I haven&rsquo;t tried it.</div>
