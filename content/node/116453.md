  body: That's what I was implying. I consider Neue Haas to be very different. Vignelli
    has been so adamant about using Helvetica; I don't think he would mind Neue Haas,
    but it does go against the very principle he has been professing his whole career.
    Didn't he say things along the lines of "You only need 10 typefaces"? Neue Haas
    wasn't one of them. I actually feel setting an article about Vignelli in Neue
    Haas is almost akin to openly mocking him. I actually don't mind that, but "very
    appropriate" is certainly not the first thing that comes to my mind.

  body: "<blockquote>Of course he was using pre-digital Helvetica:</blockquote>\r\nYou
    misunderstood to some extent. My point was that from the works I've seen from
    him in recent years, I always see the digital Helvetica. You say Neue Haas Grotesk
    is more faithful to the pre-digital Helvetica but what I've seen is what is now
    the digitized Helvetica. I haven't actually seen Helvetica the way it's presented
    as Neue Haas Grotesk now. I would argue Neue Haas Grotesk is not necessarily more
    faithful to the original Helvetica, but what Helvetica was supposed to look like
    all along. The Helvetica Vignelli loves (digitized or not) is very different.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if the pre-Helvetica, digitized Helvetica and Neue Haas Grotesk are all the same
    to him, I can't take his philosophy seriously anymore (okay, I already didn't,
    but this adds to it). How are 10 typefaces in the world enough when 3 of them
    are Helvetica? Actually, he argues there are half a dozen to a dozen typefaces
    which should be used and he uses 3 or 4. Obviously I understand he meant different
    ones and not different renditions of Helvetica, but the very existence of Neue
    Haas Grotesk seems to go against his design philosophy. Also, do we actually know
    what he thinks about Neue Haas Grotesk? I feel it's quite arrogant to impose this
    typeface on him just because it's supposedly a more faithful rendition of Helvetica.
    I don't think he has ever used Neue Haas Grotesk, but he has used Helvetica prominently."

    What do you need to study graphic design for if you can apply the same formula

    each project individually. Expressions like \"When in doubt, use Helvetica\" goes
    against the very principle of what a graphic designer should do. Such expressions

    you make money by having regular clients who send you one job after another, and
    you generally stick with certain fonts for each client. He had many clients but
    that was over a lifetime.\r\n\r\nPlus his general style was clear. You need to

    remarkable that some designers enjoy so much success that they can get away with
    doing the same thing consistently. Many of these people do it very well, but they
    would only attract a certain type of client. If your work is sought after enough
    you can certainly do that. A graphic designer should cater to the needs of the
    public though; not enforce his own preferences to design. In that regard I completely
    agree with Hrant, Vignelli was an artist more than a designer."

  body: "<blockquote>If you needed an architect or interior designer, you'd pick one
    whose style you liked. Same thing with graphic design.</blockquote>\r\nStyle,
    yes. I also admit different clients have different requirements, but if I were
    a client I would expect the designer to do something that caters to the exact
    needs of my product. If you're going to use Helvetica by default, you haven't
    done any research into the needs of my products. What happens here is that essentially
    the client did his research on what he likes and Vignelli gives exactly that.
    Where does the research of the designer come into play? Perhaps I shouldn't imply
    he doesn't do research, but what good is the research if you're not going to base
    certain design decisions on that research? \r\n\r\nAlso, you say a client should
    pick a designer they like and of course I agree with that, but I submit that many
    clients don't actually understand what they need. There is a big difference between
    what they want and what they need. With Vignelli, they \"need\" his style and
    they get it. I don't think it should be a matter of needing a style and getting
    that style exactly. As a client, supposedly I haven't studied design; there's
    a reason I'm hiring a designer to do the job. If the designer doesn't stop to
    think about what your product actually needs and just puts his brand on it, I
    submit it could be a good business because you're using a big name, but it's not
    optimal design. It's almost more of a marketing play. Not to undermine what Vignelli
    did, because it's not like I think his work isn't good. He just starts with very
    wrong premises. As Hrant said, he's an artist more than a designer in that aspect.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're not going to do any research into the needs of the clients and just cater
    to what the client thinks he needs, there's a high potential of you failing as
    a graphic designer.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If you needed an architect or interior
    designer</blockquote>\r\nI think this is somewhat different anyway, as graphic
    design inherently should communicate a message to many people. When it comes to
    architecture and interior design, personal taste seems more important. There are
    typefaces I find ugly but which I would find absolutely perfect for certain projects.
    Initially I greatly disliked Gill Sans, yet I used it anyway because it fit the
    project perfectly, and within the context of the project Gill Sans didn't look
    ugly. I eventually grew to love Gill Sans (though I'm very hesitant about using
    it at all), but that's a different matter. I find it very hard to imagine these
    kind of principles are also at play when it comes to architecture and interior
    design as they don't have to communicate a message as such. Besides, if I hire
    an architecture and he will give me a proposal which is a recycling of one of
    his other designs, I'm going to tell him he's nuts for thinking he can get away
    with that. I'm paying for a custom job, not a clone of a different building. I
    would hire him for his style and vision, not to repeat himself to the extent Vignelli
    did. I wouldn't hire an architect who's only vision is to design archs. But perhaps
    that's where the problem starts, the notion that some clients would gladly hire
    this kind of architect.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Regarding money, most clients are businesses
    and we expect to get paid well, just as they pay their accountants, lawyers, etc.</blockquote>\r\nI
    never denied its importance, but this shouldn't come into play when considering
    optimal design. I'm talking about ideals here and not to make your business work.
    Let's assume there is an infinite budget so we can talk about optimal design and
    not have this conversation clouded with business talk.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>But
    regardless of whether you liked him or not, he was a highly influential designer.</blockquote>\r\nI
    feel you keep talking past me somewhat. I never said I didn't like his work, nor
    did I deny he was an influential designer. What I do say is that he's an artist
    doing a graphic design job and doesn't adhere to what graphic design entails.
    It should cater to the needs of the product, not to put your brand on it so it
    sells automatically."

    It's part of a different discussion.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Vignelli was highly successful
    over a long career, which indicates to me that most of his clients were pleased

    and getting the most potential out of your product because of the design. I feel
    as designers we tend to listen way too much to what the client wants and thinks
    he needs. I hate the phrase \"client is king\". I will listen to what the client
    wants and I will take his ideas into consideration. I will make compromises here
    and there, but I certainly won't execute the client's very vision just because
    he's paying for the design, nor would I enforce my own vision due to personal
    preferences. Actually, I tend to do that more when I do illustrations but I'm
    an artist in that context and not a graphic designer. My illustration work is
    more personal and I don't do it for anyone just because they're paying. I'm much
    more selective in the clients I choose to work for when it comes to illustrations
    because my name is on it. When it comes to graphic design, I should remain invisible
    in the work itself."
