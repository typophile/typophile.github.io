body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI have a problem: I am working with fontforge on a font for a very
  complex artificial language (with hundreds of glyphs) that needs a lot of complex
  ligatures (with for example sovraposition of two or more glyphs).\r\nSomething like
  tibetan, if you want.\r\n\r\nI am encoding these glyph in the the unicode private
  area, and therefore, for istance, I have the following ligature: uniE2C2 + uniE2C2
  = uniE2C3\r\n\r\nTo compose them i use the ccmp funtion.\r\n\r\nNow, on my Mac these
  ligatures work perfectly, but if i try to put two uniE2C2 in text editor on windows
  (like Word, or even openoffice) they don't make any ligature...\r\n\r\nMy problems
  are:\r\n\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\nwhat have I to do?\r\n\r\nIs it possible that it is due
  to the Unicode Private Area?\r\nAnd indeed, given that these ligatures are for an
  artificial language and for an artificial script (that therefore, obviously, doesn't
  appear in the fontforge lists), what have i to set in the language aoptions? Default?
  or Martian?\r\n\r\nThank in advance"

    leading the text editor to consider my glyphs in the private area as indian or

    there is a glyph, even if the private use area has to be used, if you are using
    the right procedure for Unicode characters. You must type the four UTF8 digits
    and then Alt+x (if you have Windows). Of course, there has to be a glyph in the
    font. You can also find if there is a glyph in the font by using Search in Windows
    Character Map. "

  body: Windows OTL support is driven by the Uniscribe shaping engine, which makes
    decisions about what script is being used and what features to apply based on
    Unicode encoding and text analaysis. My guess is that Uniscribe simply doesn't
    make any assumptions about PUA codepoints, and applies no layout features to them.
    Your report of Mac behaviour suggests that Apple have chosen to apply some (which?)
    features to PUA codepoints. I can see an argument for either approach. Obviously
    it is more helpful for you if some generic layout features such as ccmp are applied
    to PUA codepoints; on the other hand, since a PUA character can be anything, who
    is to say which layout features are appropriate?

  body: "John, \r\n\r\nit's not even the question of which features to apply, but
    above all: in which OpenType Layout languagesystem the features should be registered.
    Uniscribe examines each Unicode codepoint of a string and assigns a known languagesystem
    to it, and then splits the Unicode string into \"runs\" that are of the same languagesystem.
    Then, for each run, it applies the OpenType Layout features registered in the
    font for the corresponding languagesystem. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, the Windows
    7 Uniscribe assigns the \"DFLT\" languagesystem to U+E000 and to U+F8FF, but no
    languagesystem to any of the PUA codepoints in-between. So in essence, Uniscribe
    doesn't \"know\" *which* languagesystem to apply the features for, and therefore
    it applies none. \r\n\r\nI guess it might make sense to suggest to Microsoft that
    future versions of Uniscribe should assign the languagesystem \"DFLT\" to all
    PUA codepoints, rather than just to the first and the last. But perhaps Microsoft
    had a good reason to do it the way they have done. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    information about the languagesystem used by windows 7 uniscribe?\r\n\r\nThere
    is maybe a table or something like that showing which languagesystem is assigned

    replace my glyps in some unicode codepoints assigned to a languagesystem supporting
    the ccmp.. right?\r\n\r\nAnd by the way.. what about the 2 bite codepoints, like
    0x13000 and so on? do you not which languagesystem is assigned to them by Microsoft,

    Uniscribe function on one-character Unicode strings (each being one Unicode character
    from the Unicode Standard, version 5.2). This call returned an array of OpenType
    script tags, or basically , one OpenType script tag per character. For the PUA
    characters, Uniscribe returned <code>SCRIPT_TAG_UNKNOWN (0x00000000)</code>.\r\n\r\nAdam"

    what Word is doing exactly with PUA characters, it may be intentional and hardcoded
    or may be accidental leftover from older versions. But I see at least one reason
    for Word developers to not shape them. Windows supports so called end-user-defined
    characters (EUDC), used widely in East Asia. They can be associated with all fonts
    or particular font and will be automatically displayed in place of PUA character.
    This is done by GDI automatically. There are good and bad sides of this approach.
    Good news for application is that it should not do any special processing, EUDC
    just works. But there is also a problem. EUDC can only be substituted on character
    level, which means that once you switch to glyph mode and go to Uniscribe for
    shaping, EUDCs stop working. So blind shaping of any character is not what Word
    can afford doing.\r\n\r\n<cite> > For the PUA characters, Uniscribe returned SCRIPT_TAG_UNKNOWN
    (0x00000000).</cite>\r\n\r\nThere are two tags associated with script in Uniscribe.
    First, there is one applied by default when you call old API (ScriptShape or ScriptPlace).
    This tag may or may not be mandatory. For example, Arabic text should always be
    shaped under 'arab' tag. ASCII digits are shaped with 'latn' by default, but can
    be shaped with any script tag. This is what script tag returned by ScriptItemizeOpenType
    means. Specific tag returned means it is enforced, and function like ScriptShapeOpenType
    will return error if other tag is passed. If returned script tag is SCRIPT_TAG_UNKNOWN,
    client can pass any tag based on additional information it has about the document,
    user settings, etc. For PUA characters script tag is not enforced, but it will
    be shaped with 'DFLT' tag by default.\r\n\r\n<cite> > Interestingly, the Windows
    7 Uniscribe assigns the \"DFLT\" language system to U+E000 and to U+F8FF, but
    no language system to any of the PUA codepoints in-between.</cite>\r\n\r\nI am
    not sure what you mean, but it sound strange :). All PUA characters are classified
    the same in Uniscribe, so should have exactly same properties.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n\r\n"

    singular characters that may have been wrong. Basically, I tested one-character
    strings each time (precisely because I did not want the script-neutral characters
    to inherit the shaping properties of some neighboring characters in the string).
    Or maybe I actually skipped the PUA :)"
