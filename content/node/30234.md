    what it looks like or the name of the publisher?

  body: Only reference I can find is the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=22820">Novel
    font which is also known as Caesar or Markus</a>. Not a pretty thing. There are
    many better alternatives if you want something of this flavor.

  body: "Yes, I have that NovelFont collection and that is 'Marsdale' = 'Caesar' (QBF).
    I think all of these names are aliases, but my notes don't include any 'real'
    name for the typeface. The NovelFonts seem to have vanished from circulation,
    but most were either in Opti or Brendel collections, usually with 'alias' names.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Surely, Mike, the original was Markus Low's 'Markus' for VGC. NovelFonts!,
    then, changes the name for their "version" to Marsdale and Brendel (QBF today)
    goes from Markus to Caesar (Marcus Aurelius).
