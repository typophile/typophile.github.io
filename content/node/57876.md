  body: "Lots. My two faves are sIFR and header span replacement. Others include FLIR
    and Cuf\xF3n. There are probably others, but these are the biggies. Span replacement
    is probably the easiest. Sorry, no time for links, but you can easily find it
    on Google! Good luck."

  body: "Should have mentioned...\r\n\r\nThere are caveats to each one, some with
    licensing issues (esp. the forthcoming CSS3 declaration <em>@fontface</em>), some
    with loadtime, and more. The trend (with good reason) is to replace only headers
    (for the most part); you know, display type, etc..."

  body: "As micro says, every method has drawbacks. One of my favorites, typeface.js,
    has licensing issues and is not selectable, sIFR uses flash and isn't appropriate
    for body text, fILR just does image replacement dynamically and cufon uses the
    \"canvas\" tag, but doesn't result in a searchable text. Of course, there is the
    classic span replacement (which is what I still use) since it is reliable and
    works pretty well, but you can't select the text either.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking
    for SEO type of thing, most every solution will work since they all leave the
    text in a form such that, without CSS, they are visible.\r\n\r\nSo those are the
    primary methods for getting everyone to see the same font all the time. Now, if
    you are willing to accept that some people will be able to see the font and others
    won't, you can use methods like <a href=\"http://unitinteractive.com/blog/2008/06/26/better-css-font-stacks/\"
    title=\"font stacking\">font stacking</a> to provide a better experience to those
    who have the particular font and a slightly lessened experience for those who
    don't. Of course, this can be partially overcome by the delicious <a href=\"http://github.com/philoye/FontUnstack/tree/master\"
    title=\"fontUnstack\">fontUnstack</a> that came out last week. What fontUnstack
    does is check to see which font is installed on the computer and then assigns
    special CSS classes to elements you want to have that font. In this way, you can
    set up specific CSS style rules for people who have each particular font in the
    font stack and can maintain an orderly grid despite the inherent differences in
    the fonts' leading, kerning and scale.\r\n\r\nWe're at a bit of an interesting
    time where print design is merging into web design, but issues like web licensing
    for fonts has not been resolved in any meaningful way (font-face? EOL? subscriptions?).
    So, if you want to use a non-standard font, your options aren't that great, but
    they do exist and it really depends on how you want to use the font."

    the time being.)"

  body: Yeah. It isn't a perfect solution as it can end up adding a significant amount
    of css to your html page, but it is better than accepting defeat!
