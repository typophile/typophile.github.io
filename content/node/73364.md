  that they'll go for Meta Serif as their brand face but I need to find a sans serif
  partner which will work well with Meta Serif (for use in body copy, not the logo
  itself). I realize Meta Serif is designed to work with Meta but they're not keen
  on the overuse of that typeface.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest any other sans serifs
  that will work with Meta Serif.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTim."

  body: Well, it also works nicely with the more sedate <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/ff_unit/>FF
    Unit</a>. Its designers also pair it well with FF Unit Slab (see <a href=http://fontfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ffunitslabmag_pdfx.pdf>this
    PDF</a> for info and examples).

  body: "Thanks Reed. FF Unit looks good, like the idea of using a larger font family,
    so it would fit well.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"
