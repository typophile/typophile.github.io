  body: "That looks very, very similar but to me there are noticeable differences
    in for example the J, C, S and the 2. Seems to have more of a monospaced feel
    as well. Picture is comparison using BentonSans. I am going to try and find a
    better source picture. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bentontest_6645.jpg]"

  body: My ID was only for the numerals--the text is too small to accurately ID and
    yes, it appears to be a monospaced font.

  body: "I've found Letter Gothic Std Medium which is close but it's still not there
    yet...still the noticeable difference in characters like the 2, S, N, etc....a
    tricky one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/almost_5456.jpg]"

  body: Letter Gothic looks pretty good to me, based on what little can be seen on
    the sample.

  body: "Even with the gray font and gaussian blur effect of the source text, the
    difference to me is such that if I don't find out the exact font, well...i'll
    go mad. Letter Gothic might as well be Arial at this point. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/large_3724.jpg]"
