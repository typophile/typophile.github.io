  body: I would prefer RISD as I would assume I could find a cheaper apartment there
    than I could in NYC.

    country with some programs dating back to early 1900's. Good teachers, interesting
    campus layout, and nice location. \r\n\r\n(Sorry if that is not design related,
    not quite sure what you mean by \"design related reasons only\")."

  body: "My co-worker was recently accepted to RISD. She told me the program was very
    practice/business oriented. The curriculum and the alumnus also seemed pretty
    impressive. It's rather expensive, but those four letters on your resum\xE9 can
    get you in the door anywhere. I believe they only accept 6-8 per year.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    not much info on SVA. I think Sagmeister teaches there still. Bring your band-aids.\r\n\r\n(my
    co-worker ended up going to NC State, which has a much more theory-based approach.
    After one achieves state resident status, it's under 3,000 a year!)"

  body: I went to RISD for undergrad. I always thought the graduate program was great
    while I was looking at it through the eyes of an undergraduate. Years later, I
    see little reason to change my opinion. I vote for RISD.

    come down to my long-term goals and what faculty and classes would be most likely
    to help me achieve those goals. On the other hand, if I were just going to grad
    school for the sake of going\u2014which is by no means a bad reason\u2014I would
    choose RISD just to avoid the distractions that New York offers. I\u2019d never
    get any homework done in a city with so many bookstores, theaters, museums, and
    a such a great opera company."

  body: 'Hmm. I don''t know about either of these schools from personal experience,
    but so far this thread does overlook a couple of strengths of SVA. First, it draws
    faculty from the best professionals in the New York area, which is a great center
    of graphic design. Second, if you are in New York, I would think you have more
    of a chance for direct contact with that culture, both though your teachers and
    directly. It seems to me like more of an opportunity rather than a distraction,
    but whether Manhattan fits with your personality is a serious question. Some don''t
    want to be anywhere else, for some it''s a punishment. Since they are both fine
    schools, I think Manhattan vs Providence is a serious factor to consider.   '

  body: Certainly they are both great and very competitive schools, there's no reason
    not to apply to both. If you get into both... well that's a nice choice to have
    to make. New York might offer more options for internships and such because the
    design industry is so much more established here; on the other hand there is a
    lot more competition for such jobs.

    rather the mentors and intern opportunities to be utilized...if you want to work
    in New York, go to a New York school and get your resume rolling with the crucial
    help of mentors and internships...if you don't want to work in New York, then
    don't enroll there...it's really that simple. \r\n\r\nBut why do you need graduate
    study at all? No job requires it, except of course teaching. If you want to design,

  body: "We have had plenty of grad school vs. no grad school threads. There are pros
    and cons either way and the person choosing is the only one who knows truly the
    answer. Analyzing why you may want to go to grad school will help you decide which
    one is best for you. The job you are interested in may not be the sole reason
    to make a decision. Sometimes grad school is a good choice after you have worked
    in the field a few years and are looking for a break that has redeeming values
    beyond just a vacation from work-a-day life.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    you received your Graduate degree from had an impact on your ability to find a
    teaching position? In other words, if I want to teach (and practice on the side)
    should I plan on getting my MFA from a program that is highly-selective and full-time
    (SVA, RISD, Tyler, MICA, etc.)? Or is an MFA from schools like <a href="http://www.marywoodmfa.com/index.html">Marywood
    University</a>, <a href="http://www.pubinfo.vcu.edu/artweb/CDE/mfa_home.html">VCU</a>
    or NC State just as good? How much will prospective employers care?'

  body: 'I currently go to SVA. Despite the constant love hate relationship, the professors
    make the school well worth it. To be studying closely under some of my idols has
    been an amazing experience, let alone all the other amazing people they have introduced
    us to. I currently have a few grad students in some of my classes doing a three
    year plan. The program is focused on designer as author, pushing students to create
    some sort of product/ thesis. I have no idea what RISD''s grad program is like,
    but I can''t really imagine leaving new york anymore, ever. The MFA studios here
    are pretty nice, much better than undergrad, and they''re open 24/7. '
