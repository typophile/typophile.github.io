  body: Hard to say with so few letters... I have [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic-next-soft-rounded|Trade
    Gothic Next Soft Rounded]] in mind but no italic plus I really doubt it could
    be it. Searching in progress. For the time being, could you provide more (origin,
    website...)? That could make the search easier...
