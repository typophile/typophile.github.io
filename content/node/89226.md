  body: "it could be <strong>Egyptienne Bold Condensed</strong> from URW:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/egyptienne-2/\r\n\r\nYou
    can also try the Berthold cut which seems like a better match:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/egyptienne-bq/\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>EDIT:</strong>
    On a second thought it looks like <strong>AI Egyptian Condensed</strong> \r\n(c)
