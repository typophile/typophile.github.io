body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been using InDesign for some time now, but there are a few
  things I still don't get. Can anyone tell me what are <em>[[figure space]], [[flush
  space]], [[punctuation space]]</em> and how to use them. \r\n\r\nI work mostly in
  French and according to a french typography guide I need to use a <em>non-breaking
  hair </em>and/or<em> thin space</em>. But that doesn't seem to come standard with
  InDesign. Has anyone got an idea to how I can achieve this?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "A figure space has the width same with as the lining numbers.\r\nPunctuation
    space has the width of a period.\r\nFlush space is a variable-width space that
    will change its width to fill the last line in a justified paragraph, while keeping
    the other spaces normal. The ID help has an example, look for \"flush space\".\r\n\r\nThe
    thin space is under Insert -> White space. So is the normal non-breaking space.
    Non-breaking means the two words separated by such a space won't be split in different
    lines.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!"

  body: "Seb, one can include a large number of spaces into one's OpenType fonts.
    (I do, because it's very easy to do so, and they may be called on by people such
    as yourself.) The relevant Unicode page is here:\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2000.pdf\r\n\r\nPage
    three describes the various spaces, most of which travel with an accompanying
    dash. \r\n\r\nThe figure space should be the width of the tabular numerals in
    the font: useful when setting tables. \r\nThe punctuation space should be the
    width of basic punctuation. (In a well-built font, this means the period, comma,
    colon, and semicolon.)\r\n\r\nAs you mention, French setting requires a thin space
    preceeding \"tall\" punctuation: colon, semicolon, question, exclamation, etc.\r\n\r\nHow
    you can achieve this in InDesign, I cannot say. It would be great to have a Stylistic
    Set which adds that spacing for you. (This is not a difficult task.)"

  body: "Gabriel & Chester,\r\n\r\nthank you, that helps a lot. It's simpler than
    I thought, somehow I expected those spaces to do really triksy things.\r\n\r\nI
    am haven't yet looked at OpenType, maybe because we don't use OpenType fonts at
    work. To be frank I don't really know what it's all about. There is so much to
    know these days!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: 'Sebastian, in InDesign CS, under ''type'' you will find the option ''insert
    white space'', and listed are em space, en space, flush space, hair space, nonbreaking
    space, thin space, figure space, and punctuation space. (I have the ME version,
    but I don''t think this makes a difference.) I don''t know if it depends on the
    font what is available--InDesign may have default widths--but in Adobe Jenson,
    which I am using now, there are keyboard short cuts to insert most of these spaces
    also. '

  body: "Seb, regarding the non-breaking thin/hair spaces (which I don't believe exist)
    you can always use a hack such as inserting a non-breaking (word) space and reducing
    its width in the Character palette. I had to do something similar a while back
    when I was setting a book with a lot of dashes: I wanted to use thin-spaced en-dashes,
    but InDesign does very strange things with this sort of combination, so instead
    I used word-spaced em-dashes and condensed the width of the 3-part string to 65%.
    Normally I would never recommend glyph scaling, but in this case we're talking
    about characters that will not be visually distorted by doing so (blank spaces,
    dashes).\r\n\r\nThis is, as Hrant often says, an inelegant solution, but a solution
    nonetheless."

    \r\n\r\nI'm surprised more type designers don't include all the Unicode encoded
    spaces into their OpenType fonts - you can easily add a dozen glyphs to your total
    glyph count with very little work. ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "
