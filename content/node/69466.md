  TO BE\r\nABLE TO IDENTIFY FONTS FASTER INSTEAD OF SCANNING THROUGH LIST OF FONTS
  TRYING TO FIND\r\nIT. THE IPHONE HAS AN APPLICATION CALLED \"WHAT THE FONT\" WAS
  CONSIDERING USING IT TO STUDY WAS UNSURE IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WHAT IS THE BEST
  WAY TO BEGIN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY FONTS."

    fonts you don't immediately recognize because you've studied them.\r\n\r\nIdentifont\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/\r\n\r\nType
    Navigator at Font Shop\r\nhttp://typenav.fontshop.com/\r\n\r\nAnd, of course,
