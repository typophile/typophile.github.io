<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Anybody have strong opinions/terrifying childhood memories of lowercase a and g? <br> <br>1) Were you confused the first time you noticed that your schoolbooks used the "double-decker" type, while your teacher harped on you about "not worrying about it" and focusing on the single-story versions in your handwriting? <br> <br>2) In Sans faces: should the two forms ever be mixed (double-decker a with single-story g, or vice-versa)? (This one's serious.) <br> <br>3) Do the Germans have it right? (Or are they just heavily laden with Besessenheitmitvollkommengeometrischgestalt?)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh yeah - I had major childhood trauma concerning the "a": <br><a href="https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9910&L=typo-l&P=R1336&I=-3" target=_blank>https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9910&L=typo-l&P=R1336&I=-3</a> <br> <br>Mixing: <br>The various combos are pretty common, except for having a mono "a" but a bi "g" - that seems very rare. <br>What's "correct"? Depends. But generally bi-s are like spinach: funny taste, but good for you. <br> <br>Germans: <br>May god help them: <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3943507.stm target=_blank>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3943507.stm</a> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote><hr size=0><b>quote:</b><p>Germans: May god help them:<hr size=0></blockquote> <br>A couple of years ago we had that in Belgium as well: <br>a hunt for the most beautiful Dutch word. It coincided <br>with the release of the revised edition of the "Dikke <br><a href=http://www.vandale.be/producten/15163 target=_blank> Van Dale</a>". There were some amazing finds amongst those.</div>

<div class=commentbody>1. No. I have no memory at all of my first consciousness of the difference between the single- and double-storey a and g. I have no memory of ever having a problem with the distinction. However, I learned to read quite late (around seven years old), and I suspect most of the books I competently read first used the double-storey versions. By the way, there's something to be said for learning to read after one has developed a reasonable vocabulary: one gets to start with much more interesting books. <br> <br>2. Yes. I think there are very few non-italic typefaces in which the single-storey a looks good, while the either version of the g can be used much more liberally. Frutiger is a good example of a typeface that very successfully matches the double-storey a with the single-storey g, but there are very many others.</div>

<div class=commentbody>1) I remember loosely that I thought of printed letters as doing things that handwriting couldn't and shouldn't. It (the bi-level 'a' and 'g') just seemed like another weird no-reason rule of Life that I needed to know and not question. I was a very passive kid. However, it did seem to make a little sense, since I remember thinking the same thing about serifs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>when I was very young I used to make triple and quadruple story E's. (Basically a vertical line with as many horizontal lines attached as I felt neccessary that day) ahh, typography was so much fun those days <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>
