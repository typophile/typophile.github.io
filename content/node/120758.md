body: "I'm working on a font in the same vein as Futura etc. I've used Miguel's spacing
  advice for the lowercase as I found it had the best results and forced me to evaluate
  properly rather than being too prescriptive (e.g. Walter Tracy's, which didn't seem
  to suit the profile and proportions of the lowercase). Miguel's system, along with
  my own judgement has worked well. \r\n\r\nI'm now onto the uppercase. Starting with
  the H and O. My plan:\r\n\r\nUsing the categories in the back of Karen Cheng's book,
  I've divided up the UPPERCASE logically and am just using judgement and ideas behind
  the lowercase spacing, using H and O as a starting point.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  any wisdom for this kind of sans serif \u2013 spacing and kerning?\r\n "
