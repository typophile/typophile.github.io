  certainly know that they are not available for web-licensing yet. Or in other cases
  I see poorly rendered versions of iconic typefaces and the CSS tells me that this
  must be FontSquirrel outputs.\r\nHow should I address this problem? Playing police
  and reporting this to my type-design colleges?\r\n(I might do that, if they are
  my direct friends or employers, but for the rest I don't like to be this guy.)\r\n\r\nShouldn't
  there be a kind of blacklist where such websites can be submitted?\r\nIf interested
  in hunting violation, foundries could browse through it themselves.\r\nThis might
  also create some awareness under web-developers who mostly are not interested in
  such \"boring\" details but rather discuss workarounds:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4905932/font-face-blacklisted-font"

    but for the rest I don't like to be this guy.)</cite>\r\n\r\nI am puzzled by this
    sentence, and I attribute the issue to English not being your first language.\r\n\r\nYou
    appear to be saying that if a friend of yours was using a font on his web site
    without proper licensing, you would not have too much of a problem with reporting
    the fact to the font owner, but if you saw an infringing face on a stranger's
    site, you would not wish to get involved.\r\n\r\nI would think that if a friend
    of yours was using an infringing face, instead you would contact him directly,
    inform him of what might be an honest mistake on his part, and help him to cease
    infringing - whereas I know I wouldn't hesitate to report an infringement to the
    victim if I saw it on, say, a commercial site that should know better.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Font Squirrel, their web page claims that they \"scour the Internet\" - with
    human involvement, not just in a purely automated fashion - to search for fonts
    which are legally free of charge, licensed for commercial use without payment.
    If this isn't true, the unfortunate people who believed that claim are not the
    really culpable infringers."

    he doesn\u2019t know to report possible infringement."

  body: "@quadibloc: R. pointed it out exactly right. I have quite some friends in
    type-design and I did or would give them a hint if I see their font illegally
    used. In other cases I decided to warn a web-designer or owner of a website directly
    about the violation. Especially if there is an unprotected True-Type file in the
    @font-face kit.\r\n@gargoyle: Again well clarified. Sorry for my inarticulate
    post.\r\n\r\nMainly I was hoping that an official blacklist regarding illegal
    usage of @font-face kids could race awareness amongst agencies and web-designers."
