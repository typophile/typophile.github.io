    were these announced? Were the designers listed?

  body: "Ahh, the site loaded in Firefox. I was attempting in NetNewsWire. Downloaded
    and installed the TrueTypes.\r\n\r\nAs can be expected, attempts to fit the widths
    of another font result in a weak design. Such was the case with Arial, and Liberation
    Sans is similarly stunted. The Serif is more interesting.\r\n\r\nI'm not surprised
    to hear it's Matteson. He's done this sort of <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/Ascender_fonts.html#ascendersans\">metric
    matching work</a> before.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liberation_3803.png]"

  body: Now that I look closer, it seems these may be the same fonts as Ascender Sans
    and Serif.

  body: "Yup.\r\n\r\nI loaded these up and the Sans and Mono don't look bad in my
    email program. I suspect they are pretty extensively hinted. Looks better than
    Arial for small on-screen text."

    that's been answered encouragingly by Mark. And stylistically they're not half
    bad either. Good going!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
