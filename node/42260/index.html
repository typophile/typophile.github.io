<p>I&rsquo;m preparing a talk on typeface selection which includes a section about cultural significance of type. There is a missing link though. I know that the use of blackletter on rap album covers stems from the gang tattoos, but how/why did blackletter become the preferred type style for those tattoos?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll bet it ties into the use of blackletter in Mexico, and then transferring to barrios. Then spreading in prisons as the gang members did time (sometimes on purpose I&rsquo;m told, because it was a badge of honor to do time)</p>
<p>And the blackletter in Mexico came from German immigrants that also brought Polkas, accordians, oom-pah bands, and the making a decent beer with them.

<p>I have never heard it suggested but I think that it&rsquo;s a string ( or web ) of mental associations with blackletter where each new association being only vaguely aware of being influenced by the previous one.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that nobody has gone beyond speculation with each jump.</p>
<p>For Rap &amp; LA culture I think you have a convergence of Heavy Metal music&rsquo;s use of it to signal &ldquo;Tough/Hard&rdquo; with a Mexican use which is Neighborhood/Street oriented. Heavy Metal comes to it from it&rsquo;s interest in gothic and medieval and Tolkein/fantasy imagery.</p>

<p>There seems to be a definitive documentary on early hip-hop graffiti, called [[http://www.stylewars.com/|Style Wars]]. That should tell you what you want to know. You can order it through the link. My memory is the styles of this early graphitti were not black letter, but I may well be wrong.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;gangster rap&rsquo;, which I believe started in LA, is a later development. It is important not to confuse hip hop with ganster rap, because the spirit is so different.</p>
<p>On gangster rap, there may well be an influence of hispanic gangs, but I suspect that also
Gerald Huerta&rsquo;s AC/DC logo was an influence. He writes about it on [[http://www.typophile.com/node/20336|this Typophile thread.]] That spawned a whole style for heavy metal, which I think predates the gangster rap albums and may have influenced them.</p>
<p>I short, I don&rsquo;t know the answer to your question, but these links might help put you on the right track.</p>

<p>After the conquer of Mesoamerica the first printing presses set up in Mexico used blackletter type and blackletter has been a big part of the culture ever since.</p>
<p>The book <em>Mexican Blackletter</em> has a little information on this digging into various histories of alphabets and letting will turn up much more. The question of whether American gangs picked it up on their own or appropriated it from Mexican gangs doesn’t seem to be answered yet.</p>

<p>My guess is that during the period when gang tats became popular amongst African American gang members the resident tattoo artists in Southern Cal were Hispanic or had been primarily serving the Hispanic community – where blackletter was the predominant letterform.</p>

<p>Or they just picked it up in school. Mexican ghettos aren’t the only ones with Catholic schools—almost a quarter of Americans grow up with those saints.</p>
<p>If anyone is bold enough to engage the body mod/tattoo community, it probably wouldn’t be too hard to find people in California, Texas, or Florida who could chart the history. I wouldn’t be surprised if various state and Federal police and prison wardens know all this, and have decades of photos to back it all up.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old (german?) joke about guitarist asking the drummer to use more dynamics, who responds &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;dynamics&rsquo;? I can&rsquo;t play any louder!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Might it also have to do with that blackletters don’t have as many curves as roman letterforms?</em></p>
<p>True for the lowercase, but not so much for the uppercase blackletter forms, which are often used exclusively in tattoos.</p>

Also, if you skip over the border into NM you find nothing but hatred for the German influenced  Tejano music, yet the black letter, appropriated saints, and candle shop culture cut across state borders.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I knew that &ndash; I was a breakdancer in my days. ;^) Thanks for the documentary and the tips.</p>
<p>My point in the presentation is that mainstream hip hop and R&amp;B music picked up blackletter use via the gangsta rap sub-culture. So although they&rsquo;ve got little to do with actual gangsta rap, both music genres use its specific typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you&rsquo;re looking into blackletter as tattoo art you&rsquo;re probably going to want to dig into the tattoo development side quite a lot as well. I suspect style and development of tattoo genres/phases influenced the lettering artists use. For instance, tattooing around the time of WWII lettering was a more open style, these days a lot of lettering is script or blackletter. A good example of the latter, and someone who might be able to provide insight are tattooists like [[http://www.mistercartoon.com/|Mr Cartoon]] and [[http://www.maxx242.com/|Maxx242]].</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also suggest contacting the editor of International Tattoo Art, and going to BMEzine. You might get some more answers there as well.</p>

<p>Ch: <em>the “why” seems obvious: for nazis and gangs the style connotes an ancient or deeply rooted authority, much as medieval typography itself must have seemed to the common illiterate.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;medieval&rdquo; is a very broad term, wasn&rsquo;t it Martin Luther who printed the Bible in blackletter and thus the people&rsquo;s typeface, opposed to the a bit more authoritarian catholics using Latin set in Antiqua?</p>
<p>And for the nazis, I don&rsquo;t think they used blackletter (before they banned it, but let&rsquo;s not go through all that again) because it spoke of authority but more due to its &ldquo;völkisch&rdquo; rustical character - if they had to have any reason at all to use it, other than it being the most widely used typeface style in Germany at the time.</p>

From that hot bed of rebellion against the recent past contemporary electronic, punk, and I would suggest metal were born. Most of it would be classified as prog. I could make a pretty good case that Amon Düül II, with the release of Yeti, was the proto metal band. Can the proto electronic. Hawkwind follows closely in that metal/prog. tradition. A good survey of this rediscovered music is Julian Cope&rsquo;s Krautrock Sampler.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so so much. What has been impressed on me by a variety of sources is that Mexican blackletter is the opposite of special/underground/secret/dark -  it&rsquo;s mainstream. And has been for a long time. Hence ice cream signs in Blackletter.</p>
<p>As for Metal beginning with Amon Duul - certainly the timing is valid. But Deep Purple Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath all come in right about there too 1967,8 9.</p>
<p>I am not seeing Amon Düül or anybody else in blackletter though. I may be wrong, but the earliest use I have found so far is Motorhead.</p>

That experience&ndash;where he appears on the back cover!&ndash;inspired him to return to that style for the AC/DC album, he says.</p>

<p>I think the choice of blackletter as the preferred type style for tattoos and tattoo artist has very little to do with antiquity, reglion, culture, tradition or otherwise. I think deep down what appeals to the nature of those that chose blackletter for a tattoo are the strong and weak elements of the letter form itself. They graphically impart to the user a strong sense of community. Plus, elements of the letter offer to the tattoo artist and user alike, the opportunity to re-state the letter form as an indiviual statement.</p>
<p>Test case - present two type choices to a hundred people in the 15-25 age group (group dynamic male and female). One choice sans serif, and the other choice blackletter. And ask each person why they chose one over the other. It would be cool if you could do this study in some major cities on a global scale.</p>
<p>My bet is that across all cultures, forget about just the gangs, my bet is that blackletter will be chosen over sans serif because of its letter form elements and how those elements relate to each other within each letter shape.</p>
<p>Descriptive words that superceed stuff like tradition, religion, and culture - are words like &lsquo;elegant&rsquo; and &lsquo;style&rsquo;. Those words appeal to us all equally - regardless of religion, culture, tradition etc., etc&hellip; And that imho is what reaches us from the blackletter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>I don’t think so so much. What has been impressed on me by a variety of sources is that Mexican blackletter is the opposite of special/underground/secret/dark - it’s mainstream. And has been for a long time. Hence ice cream signs in Blackletter.</cite></p>
<p>Maybe I was not very clear, but I think we are saying the same thing—that the Spanish Catholics brought in a new culture and that new culture combined with the existing traditions. Special and mainstream are not opposed in my mind, and Santería is a folk expression of the power of the introduction of western religion combined with healer/shaman traditions that existed before the Spanish. In my neighborhood people go to church but also the candle shop. I don&rsquo;t see much dark or underground about this at all. I see these non-sanctioned religious expressions on almost every porch on my street. It is just another manifestation of some cosmic wish fulfillment.</p>
<p>Blue Cheer is the official line ala Rolling Stone, but to my ear they are heavy, but also blues influenced—I don&rsquo;t completely buy it. Motorhead formed in 1975? That Hawkwind record in from 1970.</p>
<p>Amon Düül II had that heavy, plodding, sludgy gate—along with an experimentalism and anger, and a hot female singer, and…</p>

<p>@jupiterboy : i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about blue cheer as much as it&rsquo;s about &lsquo;68 - &lsquo;69 
as the beginning of the sound. i can&rsquo;t wait to seriously research this. i must know.</p>
<p>and i think the blues influence is vital (led zep) - in fact it distinguishes the metal direction from prog.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree somewhat with what Hiroshige is saying. The reason that blackletter was chosen originally was for its beauty and decorative forms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are other threads about this, but Nazi&rsquo;s had there own blackletter that was a mix of fractur and sans-serif.</p>
<p>Nobody is mentioning the fact that there are Aryan gangs in prison, and perhaps blackletter was introduced into the prison-system and therefore underground culture that way.</p>
<p>In my mind blackletter has come to represent many counter-cultures because it has a lot of power built in to its forms. It is always fun to use something that the mainstream culture has used for &ldquo;good&rdquo; and subvert it for your own use.</p>

<p>It is because the letter form has personal attributes ( ie. script) <em>and</em> has very strong attributes, that is why it is a popular type of choice throughout the body art community.</p>
<p>You should really get more. Go talk with the owners of tattoo shops. In Ottawa, places like Planet Ink (where I&rsquo;ve been seen once or twice), will tell you that it is because of it&rsquo;s attributes blackletter is popular (and too a lesser extent some cursive faces). And btw, the reverse is also true. Monoweight sans serif is not popular. It is not popular because it is seen as being - plain.</p>
<p>These are very cool words coming from different societies and cultures. Words like &lsquo;style&rsquo; and &lsquo;plain&rsquo; will always transcend pop culture. Blackletter is as hip today and the century to come, as it was during the last century and the century before that (etc.).</p>
<p>And the more &lsquo;exposure&rsquo; it gets - the more appreciated it will become as a modern artistic statement with a long rich history.</p>

<p>You are wrong &hellip;sorry.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of how the elements (weak and strong) with a blackletter relate to one another <em>is</em> what provokes a response from deep within us, mexicans, germans alike &hellip;all of us. And that my friend is called &hellip;&lsquo;good design&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Blackletter will never seem &lsquo;flat&rsquo; or &lsquo;plain&rsquo;, and from what I know of the great people of Mexico - they&rsquo;re anything but &lsquo;plain&rsquo;. The same can be said of those who participate in the body art community. And it was a natural extension for gangs to relate to blackletter.</p>

Another culture might feel quite differently and draw completely different associations deep or otherwise. And they do. You can feel something without it being &ldquo;essential&rdquo;. The idea that what you feel about type or art is essential and eternal is just nonsense. That doesn&rsquo;t make it feel less. It just means you are not the measure of all things. Is that sooo terrible? Insisting otherwise is like insisting that the universe revolves around you, or the earth, or the sun. It just ain&rsquo;t so. Have a little humility!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I lived in El Salvador for a couple years at the turn of the century. Blackletter has been in use in the artwork of the gangs for a long while; I can&rsquo;t say how long. I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say that for latin cultures the connotations bound to blackletter have more to do with formality and quality in general—as opposed to the dimension of being dangerous, edgy, misunderstood, etc.
Funny this come up today—I&rsquo;ve been drawing blackletter caps all morning.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Going back to the Elvis cover above, I think that There has for a long time been a biblical association with blackletter - by the same people who call it Gothic and Old English and used it with great solemnity. I think that by extension, since many &ldquo;bad-boy&rdquo; heavy metal bands, use black magic and evil-uber-bad devil-worship themes, blackletter is the perfect choice beause of the irreverence, and like black magic and Satanism, it&rsquo;s not really a departure from religion, it&rsquo;s just a perversion, or at least, different take on it. You can&rsquo;t reject something if you don&rsquo;t first acknowledge it. Gangs - Biker gangs in particular, tend to use death&rsquo;s heads, a devils and tombstones to represent their chosen place as outsiders, (&hellip; outlaws, 1%ers, etc.) The religious reference of blackletter lettering suggests what it is you are outside of. Biker gangs and street gangs aren&rsquo;t the same thing, but there could easily be some cross pollination.</p>
<p>And, for all the rough and tough-guy swaggering of gang types, there is quite a bit of flat-out sappy sentimentally to tattoo art. Could be that the choice of lettering for - oh, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; &ldquo;R.I.P. Mom&rdquo; could influence the lettering chosen for gang related tattoos.</p>

<p>Yes. The &ldquo;Satanists&rdquo; tend to appear in direct proportion to the fundamentalist born-agains. Here in the Jethroplex we have more churches, more strip clubs and more pyramid schemes than anywhere else in the states. Maybe I&rsquo;ll escape…</p>

<p>not sure what you meant there, but i generally agree. i&rsquo;m adding to my left sleeve next month. i hang out with plenty of ink &amp; inkers, i&rsquo;m well inked, and i&rsquo;ve not heard much tat talk, even among the art-schooled, about the formal aspects of the letterforms, let alone the word blackletter. but i&rsquo;ve heard plenty about heritage, background, symbolism, deeply associational threads, the meaning of the personal choices.</p>
<p>academics aside, the power of the letters may be in the crazy fun of them, but very much also in all the associations they bring to play.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Following up on russellim&rsquo;s perspective, I had inferred that blackletter appeals not because of associations directly with authority or religion, but with the semi-chivalric ethos that many gangs cultivate. If that&rsquo;s correct, &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;religion&rdquo; come along as ingredients to a worldview wherein the gang member is a <em>knight</em>; a bike is his <em>horse</em>; he is associated with a <em>lady</em>; loyalty to turf, group, and leader is the fundamental law; and one protects all these by violence as necessary.</p>
<p>No other design connotes that chivalric ethos, so far as I can recall early on a Saturday morning, as well as blackletter does &ndash; and blackletter subsequently signals &ldquo;strength&rdquo; and &ldquo;danger&rdquo; from its association (justified or not) with German authoritarianism, religious deviance, and other anti-bourgeois American phenomena.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask how I came by this conclusion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As James Puckett mentions, there were printing presses in Mexico who stocked up on Blackletter. In short, it was said that this influenced the signpainters in Mexico to create signage in blackletter styles, eventually becoming a standard in headline fonts/hand lettering. It made its way up to the US as people migrated north.</p>
<p>Early Hip-Hop (early 70&rsquo;s) actually did have gangs, most notable are the &lsquo;black spades&rsquo; which became the Zulu Nation. The activities included DJ&rsquo;ing, Bboy&rsquo;ing, MC&rsquo;ing, &amp; Writing/graffiti – all hobbies which predate &ldquo;hip-hop&rdquo;. Style Wars itself is actually not a documentary on &lsquo;early&rsquo; graffiti, as it was filmed when NYC graffiti was about 12 years old. Illegal graffiti actually has its origins decades before, which is where blackletter comes back into the picture.</p>
<p>Besides hobo graffiti (possibly dating back to WW1), Cholo graffiti is known as one of the first forms of illegal writing and was done in blackletter inspired forms. It is said that shoe shine boys started it all, marking their places with daubers, eventually transcending into gangs marking territory. Chaz Bojorquez, an original cholo style graffiti artist, mentions&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This squarish, prestigious typeface was meant to present to the public a formal document, encouraging gang strength, and creating an aura of exclusivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaz would probably be a great resource for you if you are into learning more about the cholo blackletter evolution. And <a href="http://www.graffitiverite.com/cb-cholowriting.htm">here</a> is the article I quoted him from.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note is that current (non-gang) graffiti has seen a small trend of artists painting their versions of blackletter. Here are a few:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>in response to:</p>
<p>[[&gt; Yves, originally hip-hop and early rap, which originated in the Bronx, New York City, was not associated with gangs. It had three elements: graffiti, break dancing, and rap music.</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew that — I was a breakdancer in my days. ;^) Thanks for the documentary and the tips.]]</p>
<p>Actually it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;hip-hop&rdquo; until the media came along and decided to package and label these &ldquo;elements&rdquo; that specific term during the 1980s. Before this, it had always been there, it had always been inner-city youth CULTURE before &ldquo;hip-hop&rdquo;, and it certainly was initially influenced by gangs. The act of &ldquo;getting up&rdquo; too stems from gangs and political messages, do your homework on what influenced TAKI 183 to start writing.. here&rsquo;s a hint &ldquo;JULIO 204&rdquo; of the Savage Skulls!!</p>
<p>The inner-city gang culture of NYC was in fact inherent to the &ldquo;bad-boy&rdquo; biker gang culture of the 1950s and 60s, hence why many kids during those days wore DA (Duck&rsquo;s Ass) haircuts and why they wore jackets with the sleeves cut off and their gang&rsquo;s name patched on the back. Ever watch the movie WARRIORS? However, they never called themselves gangs, they were called &ldquo;clubs&rdquo;, taken from Motorcycle Club (MC). Remember now, motorcycle clubs like the Hell&rsquo;s Angels, their early founding members were veterans, so their style is that of a military nature, hence the patches and the order of rank among it&rsquo;s members. Also, take a look at Afrika Bambatta, he was a high ranked Black Spades member before starting the Zulu Nation! Even the term &ldquo;B-Boy&rdquo; stems from &ldquo;Bad-Boy&rdquo;, hence their attitude when &ldquo;breakdancing&rdquo;!</p>
<p>So in ending, gangs were very much so associated with these so-called &ldquo;elements&rdquo;. Take the first ever rap crews like, &ldquo;THE FEARLESS FOUR&rdquo;, &ldquo;TREACHEROUS 3&rdquo;, &ldquo;GRANDMASTER FLASH AND THE FURIOUS FIVE&rdquo;, &ldquo;COLDCRUSH BROTHERS&rdquo;, etc. and how they flashed letters like Old English and Blackletter fonts ironed-on or screen printed on the fronts or backs of their shirts, sweaters, and jackets, or in other words their &ldquo;colors&rdquo;! Even the dancers and their crews during that time did this.</p>
