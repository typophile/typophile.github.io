  body: The first thing I would do, is take it out of the box. I think this will help
    in evaluating the relationships between letterforms vs. the relationship between
    letterforms and the box. I think you&#39;re on the right track with the &#34;r&#34;,
    but I&#39;m not sold on the &#34;F&#34; yet. Outside of the black box, I think
    you can increase the letter spacing between some of the letters more easily &#40;i-r,
    m-e for starters&#41;. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Oscar, a few issues here imo .... <BR> <BR>&#42; The dot on the i cutting
    into the F creates <BR>an odd counter shape and sharpness that <BR>doesn&#39;t
    fit in with the rounds. <BR>&#42; the Vertical stem widths appear consistent,
    <BR>but the horizontals are inconsistent. <BR>-- the counters on the m are too
    tall. <BR>--the crossbar on the F seems too thick. <BR>--the top horizontal stem
    on the F seems thick <BR>in relation to the other letters, too. <BR>You might
    set some guides, adjust, <BR>and then eyeball a print out. &#40;Actually, not
    you <BR>but your friend.&#41; <BR>&#42; the m seems too wide. <BR> <BR>bj

    <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks for all your comments, its so usefull. <BR> <BR>theres some
    changes... <BR>-delete black box. <BR>-added some roundness in the cut in arm
    of the F, also made more thin. <BR>-redraw horizontal stems. <BR>-decrease counters
    in m, also mede it some thiner <BR>-decrease counter in e <BR>-some improvement
    in spacing. <BR>-added &#34;Construcciones&#34; in officina sans. <BR>- <BR> <BR>i
    think there&#39;s some improvement, but there&#39;s lacks of personality, especiality
    on F, can i do something to achieve this?... <BR> <BR>

  body: The crossbar on the e looks a little anemic to me. You might try thickening
    it a bit.

    <BR> <BR>i really don-t worry too much of that now, even kinda like it... <BR>
    <BR>as long for the i-dot shape in red, i think it could be a nice place for some
    text, maybe &#34;Construcciones&#34; looks great right after the bullseye-i_dot,
    or maybe it results very distracting, what you think? <BR> <BR>anyway, i&#39;m
    looking to give more personality to the F, any suggestions??

  body: The logo has improved significantly. You responded well to this critique.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if the wavy lines capture the essence of construction
    in any ways that I am familiar with, but I could just be naive. Given the choices,
    I think I&#39;d go with the bottom layout, but I&#39;d increase the gray space
    in the center and decrease the weight of the lower black bar substantially, either
    by making it thinner or changing it to a dark gray. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

    common with your logo.

    with a wavy construction company? Solid right angles and blocks yes
