  body: "First? Is it really? REALLY?\r\n\r\nWow this definitely took me by surprise.
    This font looks very very good but PDF lacks some type set in this font to make
    better critique. It looks like a very nice sans body font. I don't know why but
    its stroke contrast reminds me of Optima even though they're not alike at all.
    And Optima... Boy that font was and still is popular.\r\n\r\nI don't like /g/
    because it resembles too much Meta and to my opinion doesn't really complement
    other letters. I guess it should be closed at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere also seems
    to be a bit too much weight contrast between UC and lc.\r\n\r\n/a/ top stroke
    seems to be a bit too angular compared to others.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about
    the /CH/Ch/ch/ ligature. The connecting curve goes a bit too high into /H/h/ making
    it a bit wobbly. Someone might as weel read it as /OH/Oh/oh/ even though tops
    are not connected.\r\n\r\nAnd since you've added some of those accented characters,
    why not include some more (\u010D\u0161\u017E\u0107\u0111) and make it even more
    usable throughout Europe?"

  body: "Acute accents could be moved rightward, especially over the /i/.\r\nTilde
    looks like it drops a bit as it goes left to right.\r\nInterior contour of /?/
    looks quite lumpy. Perhaps it's indecisive about whether it should be \"broken\"
    or smooth: it might be best to commit to one or the other solution more clearly.
    Same is true of /s/.\r\nEar of /g/ could use some curviness.\r\nIs the stem at
    the top left of /p/ (and bottom right of /d/) too tight compared to letters like
    /r/ and /n/?"

  body: "As Robert said, what a splendid first effort! There's a hint of Legato in
    there for me.\r\n\r\nTake comments with a pinch of salt, I'm no authority on type
    design :)\r\n\r\nI love the organic feel that the tapered stems give; however
    this seems to not be so pronounced on the VvWwXxYyZz. I think these should be
    slightly flared like the H for example, they look a bit straight.\r\n\r\nThick
    stroke of Xx is a bit heavy. Also I'd make these slightly wider and give the lighter
    stroke a bit of offset.\r\n\r\nTail of y could be a bit more confident, add a
    bit more colour. Foot of l likewise.\r\n\r\nMitres on joins of Zz look too rigid
    being vertical, I'd slant them slightly to blend in more with the 'organic' tone
    elsewhere.\r\n\r\nN may be slightly too wide or too heavy. Bowl of P may need
    to be larger (bring the bottom of the bowl down a notch).\r\n\r\nInner curve of
    S has too much of a cusp at the top.\r\n\r\nLooks like spacing needs work on the
    text sample.\r\n\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Seeing it set in a text block I can see many kerning problems as well as
    uniformity. That's one of the main pillars of any text font. Kerning should improve
    it considerably but some shape changes will improve it even more. Since glyphs
    are quite narrow you have to be careful to not set this font too tight because
    it could make it look stretched.\r\n\r\nIs it just me or would anybody else remove
    the ear on /p/? And it also leans a bit to the right. Put it beside /r/ and you'll
    see because /r( has the opposite effect of leaning to the left a bit.\r\n\r\nAnyway.
    After you solve spacing/kerning at least to some extend some details will become
    more apparent.\r\n\r\nContinue your work. I suppose you've realised it is much
    work in making a font. But the rewards can be just as satisfying. Keep on doing
    it because you've started nicely."

    not sure about if there's a correct weight contrast between UC & lc yet. \r\n\r\nThe
    Glyphs /Ss/ I've decided to make the inner curves rounded but I don't know if
    that is a possible solution.\r\n\r\nThe text sample 1.1 has no kerning at all,
    just an adjustment in the horizontal metrics.\r\n\r\nGive me your opinions about
    this changes I've made with your inputs.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "UC&lc weight seems fine.\r\n\r\nI wanted to <em>complain</em> about the erroneous
    looking /Ss/ glyphs but since you've smoothed them out I don't have anything else
    to say.\r\n\r\nI can see you've made a more appropriate /g/. It's just that it's
    a tiny bit too heavy compared to others.\r\n\r\nRight stroke of /y/ seems thinner
    than left one. And the whole shape is maybe not as finished as it should be. I
    know... /y/ although seemingly trivial is rather quite a hard glyph to make.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I wasn't looking close enough because I couldn't find /x/ in your text, because
    I think it's a bit wide for its shape.\r\n\r\nId also make /D/ a bit less wide
    as well. Because of it's big fat bowl and straight stem it looks quite wide. A
    little wide. Test it in text and see for yourself whether it actually is wider
    than others.\r\n\r\nCompared to the nice slight stroke contrast some characters
    look a bit odd. And those would be /vwxy/ and potentially also /z/, but the last
    one is not that bad because of angular corner cut. The same UC letters seem a
    bit thinner compared to others.\r\n\r\nAnd try this: Since /R/ is much wider at
    the bottom, maybe some difference could also benefit /K/. Not as strong, but making
    it less vertically symmetric could benefit its shape.\r\n\r\nBut apart from these
    glyph shapes I'm not going to say anything about kerning yet because that is still
    to come.\r\n\r\nI find your upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1 a very positive change in
    the right direction."

  body: "Looking at the word hamburgerfonts in light medium and bold. Its a very nice
    type with a cut paper feel\r\nSome features in the light become obtrusive in the
    bold like the top of the ear in g has 2 straights whereas a curve might be better.
    I'd also try thickening the terminals on s. The a which looks fine in the light
    is getting a bit rowdy in the bold. But I'm really being picky it's a great effort
    so keep going with it."

  body: "Nice work: To my eye the colour looks quite even now. I think some of the
    round terminals don't go with the cut paper incised quality of this face especially
    top of p \u2013 Perhaps q could do with being taller on the right \u2013  did
    you try an o and g with a modulated sharp interior angle as in /b/d/p/q/\u2013
    and / j/ is heavier at the bottom but doesn't need to be because of it has a descender.
    It's interesting that this hand drawn paper quality cut quality disappears in
    small sizes.  Keep going"
