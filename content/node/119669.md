  body: "Unusual indeed, Kevin. apostrophe was a notorious masked man. A few years
    prior to establishing apostrophic labs, he angered all the major foundries by
    uploading thousands of commercial fonts onto a newsgroup. Referred to it himself
    back then as a \"font orgy\". Never was there a bigger, louder, invective-filled
    discussion about copyright and piracy.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that he was Fredrick
    Nader, THE top custom font designer for big firms in Toronto!\r\n\r\napostrophic
    labs was sort of a font commune producing high-quality (technically, not design-wise
    in many cases) free fonts. apostrophe made a lot of them, but many others contributed
    and then apostrophe would help out with advice and technical fixes. They were
    the only ones putting out free multiple master fonts (remember those?).\r\n\r\nBased
    on the number of times it's been ID'd here and on MyFonts' forum, I suspect that,
    if <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/lab_scriptina.htm' target='_blank'>Scriptina</a>
    had been a commercial font, it would have been a huge money maker. Check out <a
    href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/k_m.htm' target='_blank'>Mistress
    Script</a> and the slew of alternates and ligatures in the Alt font."

  body: "Mike, I love your story about apostrophe and his days as font bandito in
    the wild west of early digital fontmaking. I remember him from his years at alt.binaries.fonts.
    I might be wrong, but I seem to recall that he originated the expression that
    a font was \"in the wild.\" Meaning a commercial font that someone had uploaded
    to abf or posted to a bbs.\r\nDon"
