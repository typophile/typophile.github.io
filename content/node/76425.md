  new lettering posters.\r\n\r\n[[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/11/15/typographic-posters-dreams-stars-so-much-to-do/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ILoveTypography+(i+love+typography)&utm_content=Google+Reader|Here
  you can read an interview from ILT blog]]\r\n\r\nScketches show us how he got to
  the final solution, developing the entire process.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of all Lester
  works (who is not?...lol) and I wish I could start developing some fine lettering
  artworks...\r\nWe can see a lot of hand-writing developement, then vectorized.\r\nAbout
  the vector-converting  process, do you have any, suggestion, tutorials, links, guides,
  in order to understand the right way to do that?\r\nIs that an amazing and endless
  pen-tool masterpiece, or we can follow different rules/ using different tools. How
  can we create the central white lines that we find in the middle of all the curly
  letters?\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dreams_roughs2_4014.jpg]"

    in pencil. Then still in pencil build up where the strokes need to be thicker.
    When you are ready, outline your drawing in ink. Finally, erase the pencil lines
    when the ink is dry. \r\n\r\n<cite>or we can follow different rules/ using different
    tools.<cite>\r\n\r\nYes."
