body: "I am looking for a very very condensed font, to use for numbers (prices) on
  store shelf tags. \r\n\r\nI've searched and searched but have not found anything
  quite skinny enough. The prices have to fit in a very small width space but are
  required to be a certain height (by law).\r\n\r\nIn the past I've adapted a font
  by further condensing it, but I'd prefer to buy a very very condensed font for this
  new round.\r\n\r\nI'll need a heavy or black as well as a light or book face. Even
  better if $ and \xA2 are smaller than the numerals.\r\n\r\nThe font should be sans
  serif, and should play well with avenir which will probably be used for the rest
  of the type of the signs.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\r\n\r\n--Betty"

    \r\n\r\nCan I ask if you just knew these typefaces or if you used a search function
    to find them? I feel like there must be more keywords to help in my quest. I've
    searched condensed, compressed, narrow, thin as well as many \"fonts like this.\"\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n--Betty"

    want to mechanically compress it further, choose something with stroke contrast
    (so you don't get the stroke contrast flipped), and maybe something by Unger,
    since he designs with mechanical compression in mind.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n"
