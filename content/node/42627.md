    about a specific house style and not generally accepted usage.

  body: I'd consider using italics on the creator of the face if anything, not the
    typeface name itself. Caslon Black, by <em>William Caslon</em>. Though, really,
    I wouldn't do either...

    from time to time, Times was used all the time, at other times Times was hardly

  body: Typefaces are typically not italicized, but I do wonder if they should be.
    Paintings, books, and other prominent, significant pieces are italicized, so wouldn't
    it be logical to put a type family in the same category? Italicizing from this
    standpoint might be a minor statement, since it would argue that typefaces are
    important creative works -- a sentiment I quite like.
