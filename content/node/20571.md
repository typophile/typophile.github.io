  am looking for a typeface for the BURMA SHAVE logo. I know that it is most likely
  handlettered, and if so, can you suggest a very very similar font?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Burma-shave-logo_6460.jpg]"

  body: "The problem you will have trying to match it with a single font is that the
    lowercase is basically like a glyphic italic* with minor swash, and the cap B
    and S are both swash scripts.\r\n\r\nTake a look at a few of the script and italic
    faces on <a href=\"http://www.fontmesa.com/font_index.htm\" target=\"new\">FontMesa.com</a>
    and see if you like them (though the scripts are connected, the have the feel).\r\n\r\n*FYI
    -- \"glyphic italic\"\r\nNick Shinn's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/condensed-heavy-italic/\"
    target=\"new\">Beaufort Condensed Heavy Italic</a> has a similar \"feel\" in the
    lowercase, but a font is more precise and consistent than a handlettered sign.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beaufort_hvy-ital_4690.png]"

    like the Burma Shave logo (used in this ad during WW II) is quite different. I
    guess the sign painters had some latitude in producing one of America's most famous
    roadside ad campaigns.\r\n\r\n"
