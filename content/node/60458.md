  close to this. Little help? What would this font be, or something similar so that
  I can customize it (y'know, outlines in Illustrator, the manipulation) to achieve
  the same look. \r\n\r\nMy boss in in LOVE with this one, may marry. Loves the 'e'
  and the 'm'. Assistance, pls!\r\n\r\nThanks, in advance, Marko[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nemesis_6290.jpg]"
