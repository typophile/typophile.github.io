  body: hi, Stefanie. <BR>first of all i dont like italic in &#34;divisign&#34; <BR>and
    its spacing in correlation with <BR>&#34;forte&#43;wegmann&#34;. maybe you should
    use <BR>some real 3d forms as a sign?

  body: i meant some pseudo 3d structure <BR>or something more modern &#40;as Darrel
    said&#41;.. <BR>about typeface, try some techno faces or <BR>frutiger but at more
    havy weight.. <BR>

  body: 'Stefanie: <BR> <BR>I like your concept of taking the parent company&#39;s
    mark and giving it a 3-D effect, but you may need to loosen it up a bit to avoid
    having it look dated &#40;as Darrel said, &#34;too 70&#39;s/80&#39;s-era&#41;.
    Develop the concept more, but don&#39;t make it look so rigid &#40;square&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>What kind of scanning technology is used? Do points/dots represent the
    technology better than lines? <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: Thanks for your answers. <BR>It is an optical scan technology, with two cameras.
    If an object is scanned there will apear lines on the object. There are no points
    in the scanning process instead of a red laser point to focus the object.  <BR>Perhaps
    I could try to use some kind of camera for the logo but the scanned objects should
    be on the focus.

  body: Why do you have variations in type weight? To the average person it might
    seem like an accident or way to suttle of a concept.

  body: Why are you not dotting the &#34;i&#34;&#39;s in the lc versions? They look
    like &#34;1&#34;s. Is this intentional, and if so, what does it mean? Honestly,
    none of these are working for me. I don&#39;t think the two faces are working
    well together. Especially with the weight treatment that David identified. <BR>

  body: 'Hi Stefanie, <BR> <BR>how&#39;s it going? I&#39;m interested in the progress,
    if there is any. <BR> <BR>My $0,02: <BR> <BR>Like Scott, I don&#39;t really see
    any of the four Info Office/Info Text concepts work well. <BR> <BR>1st one: spaced
    too tight. Base line of the two parts &#40;divi and sign&#41; doesn&#39;t seem
    to match. &#34;i&#34;s look like &#34;1&#34;s. <BR> <BR>2nd one: I don&#39;t see
    the two sides go very well together. Somehow I find the lettershapes of the &#34;divi&#34;
    part too cheap. <BR> <BR>3rd one: Base line problem again. I don&#39;t really
    like the serifs on the divi side either. <BR> <BR>4th one: Absolute no-go, if
    you ask me. Info Office and Info Text look way too similar in this one, building
    up zero contrast, but giving an uneasy, heterogenous look to the whole thing.
    &#34;i&#34;s look like &#34;1&#34;s again. <BR> <BR>Generally, I don&#39;t see
    why you&#39;re breaking up &#34;divisign&#34; into two parts and why the &#34;sign&#34;
    part is emphasized, particularly as you stated above that it&#39;s composed of
    three ingredients &#40;digital, vision and sign&#41;. <BR> <BR>The divisign logo
    isn&#39;t bad as a variant of the mother company logo, but I think that there&#39;s
    room for improvement, especially when a very close resemblance between the two
    logos isn&#39;t mandatory. <BR> <BR>From a geometric point of view, the pseudo
    3D logo isn&#39;t completely logical &#40;with the vertical lines forming a square,
    one would intuitively expect the lines that indicate the sphere to flow both to
    the left and the right instead of exclusively to the right&#41;, but this isn&#39;t
    too big of a concern to me. <BR> <BR>Keep it coming. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
