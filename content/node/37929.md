  body: I would say no, don't capitalise roman as an adjective describing a typeface,
    unless of course you are an archaeologist and you dig up a Roman typeface. :)

  body: "However, when it's a font name (noun rather than adjective), it may be capitalized.\r\n\r\nBut
    Capitoleum refers to its roman as Regular, rather than Roman -- thereby avoiding
    the possibility of the font being a Roman roman. More of a Dutch Roman roman,
    really."

  body: "The Wikipedia article explains why \"roman\" is, in most typographic uses,
    spelt uncapitalized:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_type\r\n\r\n<em>Wiki
    says no, but can you really trust an open-forum encyclopedia?</em>\r\n\r\nIf you
    mean the Wikipedia article \"roman type\", yes, you can trust that particular
    article. I wrote and researched it using the best type history sources available.
    A novice Wikipedian calling himself an \"amateur linguist\" recently tried to
    remove the statement about Renaissance and later roman lettering versus ancient
    Roman lettering on the grounds that <em>he thought</em> it sounded like original
    research. He was out of his depth. I advised if he had trouble believing the statement
    as the published opinion of major type historians he should find a copy of the
    source I used and verify it for himself.\r\n\r\nIn general, Wikipedia cannot be
    trusted unless the content you're reading is cited with a verifiable reference.
    Wikipedia is a crank magnet.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    numerals are those as used by Romans. Ergo it is capitalised because it refers
    to the specific Roman culture as is per the norm in English.  But roman numerals
    would be contrasted with italic numerals.  Hence also Arabic numerals, but arabic
    alphabet (in general) yet Arabic alphabet (when denoting specifically the Arabic
    language).  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos
