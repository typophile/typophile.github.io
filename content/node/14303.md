body: "This is my most recent experiment. The inspiration was something my high school
  art teacher told me years ago. While on the phone he would scribble onto a piece
  of paper and try to find human faces from the resulting lines. I've tried to do
  the same with letterforms.\r\n\r\nAfter I located a set of upper and lowercase I
  placed them on top of each other to further the idea of unconscious scribbling and
  layering.\r\n\r\nI've been playing with this very much off and on (mostly off/ignoring)
  for three months but not at all sure how to develop or improve on this very basic
  idea. Any thoughts? Do you think the idea is even worth it?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "I think seeing faces in scribbles or a clown face ( or whatever) in a cloud
    is a fine experiment. I think you would have to stay at it for about 10 years+
    to really find something tasty & font worthy in it. It seems like a fine excersize
    in looking/thinking/seeing though.\r\n\r\nWhen you say 'worth it' - what do you
    mean precisely? I was just guessing above..."

    it worth it as a font on it''s own? It has it''s own chapter in my notebook. '

  body: 'IMHO: I think this is a good idea for a poster or lettering or something
    in which one could see the concept more clearly. As a font, it loses impact; it
    looks like a simple sketch.'

  body: Thankyou both for your comments. Eduardo, I'll try an experiment showing the
    original scribble aswell as the letterforms.

  body: "Now I am starting to see where you are going. Especially the s! \r\n\r\nYou
    know Fontfont had some interesting experiments & FUSE too a while ago that remind
    me of this. Have you looked ta that stuff?\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing is definitely
    out of fashion now of course but I myself feel sympathetic to the experimental
    urge. I want to encourage you! \r\n\r\nWhat is your technique now? It isn't completely
    scribbled is it? I wonder what it would be like if you were laying handwritting
    over & over to start to find new shapes/relationships.\r\n\r\n-e.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You court me out. Those weren't the original scribbles the letterforms were
    made from. I set the word and added the scribbles after but I like the results
    and it's close to the asethetics of my first sketches. \r\n\r\nYour handwritting
    idea is interesting. I experimented a lot with handwritting and signatures on
    my Foundation Art and Design course before university, layering signatures from
    the student signing in book on top of each other using acetate. I'll try to find
    the experiments to show you and work on.\r\n\r\nCheers Eban,\r\n\r\nNP."

  body: "Great. I think to make something you really like - something of long term
    value it would still take a long time! \r\n\r\nBut I am happy to see what you
    are trying out & what you like. \r\n\r\nI guess where I was going with this in
    my own mind was that the forum of typophile & the urge to put something up that
    can create may not be the shape or length of time needed to do good work. While
    my enthusiansm may help at first if you rush to meet it - it might constrain your
    process. And I don't want to see that happen. \r\n\r\nNow that I write this idea
    down it seems a little partronizing. If it feels that way - sorry. Like I said
    before; I want to encourage you."
