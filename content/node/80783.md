    from scratch!\r\nOr maybe even just take the \"L\" and rotate it 180...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sorry. I should have added more details. I only need it to match the \"DD\"
    because in my design it would only say DD in Frankfurter. \r\n\r\nIt would have
    read, \"DD \u05D0\u05E0\u05D9 \"\r\n\r\nThat was what I originally had in mind
    and may switch back to that.\r\nNow instead of writing out the \"DD\" in english
    letters I plan to use the Hebrew letters for D. I guess, I would still need a
    font that would match Frankfurter but now I think theres more freedom since the
    \"DD\" wont be present in the design. \r\n\r\nNow it will read \"\u05D0\u05E0\u05D9
    \u05D3\u05D3 \" "
