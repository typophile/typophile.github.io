body: "Well, I guess I'm what you call a newbie to the forum.  I was hoping for a
  critique of a new logo/name for our small business.  We specialise in on and off-site
  PC sales, service, and repair.\r\n\r\nOur current name \"Your PC Service Centre\"
  was deemed by all and sundry to be too long for the corporate world (our original
  target market was the suburban residential area) so a change was deemed to be in
  order.\r\n\r\nI'm playing with Phoenix Technical Services as a name, and threw together
  some roughs of a logo/typeface and some print adverts to see what it looked like
  on \"paper\"\r\n\r\nAlso included is our current logo soon to be retired, it seems.\r\n\r\nIf
  you could pass on a few words about my line of thought it would be appreciated :)\r\n\r\nTarin"

  body: "Should have mentioned that the fonts for the filler text in the pseudo-print
    adverts were chosen at random and do not try to prompt any reaction on the part
    of potential viewers.\r\n\r\nThe logo is not an original of mine but a found image
    that sort of fits the idea.  The name was chosen because the main focus of the
    business at this time is the repair and rebuilding of PC's, so the phoenix legend
    seems to fit :)\r\n\r\nThe font on the Phoenix logo is Avant Garde Ext Lit ITC\r\n\r\nEvilBunny"

  body: Stay with number one with a few changes. Make Technical Solutions justify
    with Phoenix. Maiking it just short of justifing looks like a mistake. Open up
    the leading from Phoenix and Technical Solutions. I like number one the  best
    because you don't over do the flame/tail of the Phoenix. I don't know though why
    you need to make the e orange. I don't think it helps the logo. One last thought,
    don't loose your original name it could be useful as a tagline instead of Technical
    Solutions in certain contexts.

  body: I like your phoenix mark. It's not too litteral and catches the eye. What's
    the rationalle behind the typeface you ghave chosen? I agree with Dan about the
    e. The old name 'Your PC Service Centre' was targeted at being approachable &
    friendly not corporate. The face you have here seems maybe fashiony to me. Classy
    yes, but not techy or corporate. But I am assuming things about your intent. What
    is your intent?

  body: "The home market seems slow to respond, so a revision of the business plan
    to include the corporate market seems a good way to expand the business.\r\n\r\nOur
    goal is to be there as a safety net for business with the fast turnaround or replacement
    of computers a major feature of the business.\r\n\r\nThe Avant Garde Ext Lit ITC
    font face was chosen as it was clean and easy to read.  I am new to this area
    so any suggestions on font choice will be quickly followed up.  We have some of
    the adobe FontFolio CD's onhand so any suggestion should be available to us.  The
    red 'e' was a visual tie-in with the color of the bird logo, but has been removed
    in the revised image.  The \"Technical Services\" font has also been changed to
    Avant Garde Gothic to highlight the text with the smaller font size.\r\n\r\nThe
    idea was that a colour change in the typeface itself would help to \"break up\"
    the business name as well as provide a point of difference from our direct competitors
    (who use all black standard typefaces) and hopefully be remembered by our market
    audience eg. in correspondence the name itself could be used as a distinctive
    mark seperatly from the logo.\r\n\r\nOur intent is to promote ourselves in a no-nonsense
    manner with a distinctive logo, typeface, and advertising style.  Our intended
    advertising target will be IT professionals, office or financial managers, small
    business owners, etc.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.yourpcservicecentre.com/phoenix4.jpg\">Revised

  body: "I think this solution can work. It is stronger now. I wonder about making
    the 2nd line of text fill out a bit more so that it is more even visually. The
    type you have chose is oddly both analystic & romantic at the same time. Analytic
    in the perfect roundness of it's 'o' romantic ranther than pragmatic in it's insistance
    on such a simplification.\r\n\r\nI will still suggest that you consider some type
    that has a feeling of reliability - especially since you are in a service business!
    If you sold soap, art or cut hair I would not be saying this.\r\n\r\nHere are
    some ideas:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/zwo\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/klavika/\r\nand
    if you are keen on your old foms but want to make yourself distict nonetheless
    consider\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/bryant/\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nIf
    it was me I might well choose this\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ourtype.be/\r\n\r\nLook at

  body: 'You might make Technical Solutions a bit larger and tighten up the letter
    spacing. Avant Guard tends to float anyway. Keep in mind that the logo isn''t
    going to make you one sale. It will be your communications and service that does
    that. The point being is don''t over think this one. '

    as a vector shape (Illustrator or equal). You will thank me down the line. This
    will prevent you from having to print in process colors all the time. \r\n\r\nThe
    Bryant Logos don't add anything to the communication for me, other than making
    the Ph combination look to tight and the tagline again is floating. Once again
    make the tagline larger and tighten the letter spacing."

  body: I agree with Dan's instructions regarding the spacing & so on but I think
    Bryant feels more techy and is therefore more appropriate. He is right of course
    that the logo won't sell you per se - but it can grease the skids or fail to do
    that or worse still grit them up. So I think it is worth spending some time &
    consideration on. The category of business you are in takes less advantage of
    logos & identity than other business do. Soap & Cars rely on identity. It's their
    life blood. This isn't true for computer services services. However, memorability
    of the identity will help later when you get word of mouth going. And finally
    the minimum standards that business and the public have for identity are rising
    every year. It is worthwhile to get it right so you don't need to address the
    issue again in the near future.

    \ \r\n\r\nThe orange colours are really to distinguish our presence from our competitors

    another thought, maybe the logo itself needs to be more stylised? maybe more symmetrical?
    or a bit smaller? I'm thinking about letterheads, business cards, promotional
    materials etc.\r\n\r\nIf you have the time, I would love to hear your opinions

  body: 'It looks like there is an auful lot of space between the the n&s in ''solutions''
    I would suugest that you show us these designs in PDf format so we can see if
    it''s just a bad screen render or if your spacing is actually a problem. I do
    think that you might try making the flames smaller next to the text. Maybe not
    too. Have you done any business card mock ups? If you lay your logo out with 6
    others making them take up about the same amount of space optically then you can
    start to see where your design may begins to break. That Newbase really is pretty
    poor. What do you mean by stylized? The best way to see if what you have is working
    in general is to try it out - for cards: make one & print it. Hold it in your
    hand. Your eyes will tell you alot when everything is to size & context. Sometimes
    there are surprises. Sometimes good. Sometime bad. But testing is your friend.
    Your ads are a great example.'

    to test. \r\n\r\nAnd Newbase is just terrible. "

    they want to do business with: small & large business. ''Your'' & ''my'' as part
    of names seems very dated, sort of a 90''s thing to me... Even if it''s dressed
    up in new spelling. ''Ur'' also could be read as the indicisive noise like ''uh''.'

    and more corporations are looking for IT companies they can trust. Ones that will
    not be gone tomorrow leaving them high and dry. The only way this can be conveyed
    is through a good name, a good image and service that goes beyond expectations
    every single time. I think the way you advertise it and market it will be the
    key player in a name such as UR. Then again, I did just throw it out there to
    generate thoughts though. It may not be the right answer, but definitely something
    to think about. You have to break the mold from the name to the service and everything
    in between. Good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Szala\r\nVigor Graphic Design, LLC.\r\nwww.vigorgraphics.net\r\n\r\n"
