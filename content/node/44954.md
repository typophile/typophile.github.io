body: "Here's a notation that references something I'd found in the way of conversations
  at the Typophile forum. The follow up, here: \r\n\r\nHey, Typophilics \u2014 this
  is an old thread, http://www.typophile.com/node/6777, but it\u2019s funny because
  I just found it. I was looking for something else, and this came up. To the nature
  of the font, it\u2019s not Trajan \u2014 it\u2019s a customized Girvin titling font;
  surely, it\u2019s based on 1st century epigraphy, but not on Twombly\u2019s Trajan.
  Trust me, I\u2019ve had so many of my logotype renderings converted into Trajan
  solutions by agencies, it\u2019s a joke.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been working as a designer
  for motion picture marketing since 1978-79, and Apocalypse Now, Francis Coppola.
  And what happens is that you create solutions that are endlessly juried and judged
  by either the directors, the studio leadership, the talent, whomever is involved
  in the proposition \u2014 and toned down. The art fullness, diminished. So, doing
  a rendering of the Last Samurai, or Lord of the Rings, Gladiator \u2014 The Ghost
  and the Darkness \u2014 or Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events,
  each of these treatments is entirely customized \u2014 tuned and built by hand.
  And if there\u2019s an agency conversion, the customized solutions move to easily
  built imitation solutions by the agencies, and...the work is gone.\r\n\r\nMore here

  said, as they say in the comics.\r\n\r\nI started working on Lemony Snicket as a
  production designer for Count Olaf\u2019s eyes \u2014 which then became part of
  the logo, then from there, building out the fonts and related work to create the
  master \u2014 for a committee and client team of 15.\r\n\r\nRough, but done.\r\n\r\nReach,
